Jehovah-shammah--a Glorious Name for the New Year

   (No. 2182)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 4, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord Is There [or in
   the Hebrew, 'Jehovah-Shammah.']" Ezekiel 48:35

   THESE words may be used as a test as well as a text. They may serve for
   examination as well as consolation and, at the beginning of a year,
   they may fulfill this useful double purpose. In any case they are full
   of marrow and fatness to those whose spiritual taste is purified. It is
   esteemed by the Prophet to be the highest blessing that could come upon
   a city that its name should be, "JEHOVAH-SHAMMAH, The Lord Is There."
   Even Jerusalem, in its best estate, would have this for its crowning
   blessing--nothing could exceed this. Do we reckon the Presence of the
   Lord to be the greatest of blessings? If in any gathering, even of the
   humblest people, the Lord God is known to be present in a peculiarly
   gracious manner, should we make a point of being there? Very much
   depends upon our answer to these queries.

   Doubtless many would be greatly pleased if there were no God at all,
   for in their hearts they say, "No God." God is not to them a father, a
   friend, a trust, a treasure. If they were to speak from their hearts
   and could hope for a satisfactory answer, they would ask, "Where can I
   flee from His Presence?" If a spot could be found where there would be
   no God, what a fine building speculation might be made there! Millions
   would emigrate to "No God's Land," and would feel at ease as soon as
   they trod its godless shore! There they could do just as they liked,
   without fear of future reckoning.

   Now, Friend, if you would escape from the Presence of God, your state
   is clearly revealed by that fact. There can be no Heaven for you, for
   Heaven is where the Lord's Presence is fullness of joy. If you could be
   happy to be far off from God, I must tell you what your fate will be.
   You are now going away from God in your heart and desire and, at last,
   the great Judge of All will say to you, "Depart, you cursed"--and you
   will then be driven from the Presence of the Lord and from the glory of
   His power.

   I know that there is a company who can truly say that they feel only
   happy when they are conscious that God is with them. The place where
   they meet with the Lord is very dear and precious to them because of
   His unveilings. The memory of holy convocations is sweet because the
   Lord was among them. They would not care to go where God is not. If
   there were a place forsaken of God, however happy and full of merriment
   men might think it, they would not be found among its guests. Where we
   cannot enjoy God's company, we will not go. Our motto is--"With God,
   anywhere. Without God, nowhere." In Him we live, and move, and have our
   being and, therefore, it would be death to us to be apart from God!
   Without God we should be without hope. Ah, my dear Friend, whatever
   your difficulties, trials and sorrows, all is well with you if God is
   your delight and His Presence your joy! But, however high your temporal
   enjoyments may rise, it is all wrong with you if you can rest away from
   the God of Grace. The child must be in a sad state of heart when he
   does not care to have his father's approving smile. Things must be
   terribly wrong with any creature when it can be content to walk
   contrary to its Creator. Nothing but the corruption of the heart could
   permit any man to be at ease away from God.

   Will you permit these thoughts to saturate you for a little time? I
   have spoken them with the desire that each one of us may ask himself,
   "Is the Presence of God my delight?" If so, I am His, and He will be
   with me. On the contrary, "Is the Presence of God a matter of
   indifference, or even of dread?" Then my condition is one of guilt,
   disease and danger. May the Lord, in His infinite mercy, set me right!

   This much may stand as a preface, but it must not be treated as most
   prefaces are, namely, left unread, or glanced over and forgotten. I
   pray you, carry it with you all along.

   I. Now kindly notice that, according to our text, THE PRESENCE OF GOD
   IS THE GLORY OF THE MOST GLORIOUS PLACE. The Prophet Ezekiel has been
   telling us many remarkable things which I shall not attempt to explain
   to you--and my chief reason for not doing so is the fact that I do not
   understand them, myself. Even if I could open up every dark saying, now
   is not the time to go into an explanation of all the sublime mysteries
   which were seen by the eagle eye of Ezekiel, for I seek present,
   practical edification--and this we can gain in an easier way. It is
   clear from the text that when God shall bless His ancient people and
   restore them to their land--and the Temple shall be rebuilt and all the
   glory of the latter days shall arrive--this will still be the peculiar
   glory of it all, that, "the Lord is there." The Prophet works up a
   climax and closes his Book of prophecy with these glorious words, "the
   Lord is there."

   What a glorious state this world was in at the very first, in the age
   of Paradise, for the Lord was there! Our glorious Creator, having taken
   the first days of the week to make the world and fit it up for man, did
   not bring forward His dear child until the house was built and
   furnished and supplied for his use and happiness! He did not put him in
   the Garden to dress it till the roses were blooming and the fruits were
   ripe! When the table was furnished, He introduced the guest by saying,
   "Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness." The Lord put man,
   not in an unreclaimed plot of soil where he must hunger till he could
   produce a harvest--but into an Eden of delights where he was at home
   with creatures of every sort to attend him! He had not to water dry
   lands, nor need he thirst, himself, for four rivers flowed through his
   royal domain, rippling over sands of gold. I might say much of that
   fair garden of innocence and bliss, but the best thing I could say
   would be the Lord was there! "The Lord God walked in the Garden in the
   cool of the day" and communed with man--and man, being innocent, held
   high converse with his condescending Maker! The top stone of the bliss
   of Paradise was this all-comprehending privilege--"the Lord is there."

   Alas, that has vanished. Withered are the bowers of Eden--the trail of
   the serpent is over all landscapes, however fair. Yet days of mercy
   came and God's saints, in divers places, found choice spots where they
   could converse with Heaven. In the first days, our gracious God spoke
   with His chosen ones in their daily walk, as Enoch; or under the oak,
   as Abraham; or by the brook, as Jacob; or before the bush, as Moses; or
   near the city wall, as Joshua. Wherever it might be, the place became
   to them the gate of Heaven, for the Lord was there! Amid a torrent of
   sin and sorrow, you may cross the stream of time upon the
   steppingstones of the places marked, "JEVOHAH-SHAMMAH." The Lord's
   delights were with the sons of men and to them, nothing brought such
   bliss as to find that the Lord still would be mindful of man and visit
   him.

   In the days when God had called out unto Himself a chosen nation, He
   revealed Himself at Sinai, when the mountain was altogether on a smoke
   and even Moses said, "I do exceedingly fear and quake." Well might he
   feel a holy awe, for the Lord was there! I will not dwell upon the
   Glory of the tabernacle that was pitched in the wilderness, with its
   costly furniture and its instructive rites, for, after all, the Glory
   of the tabernacle was that the Lord was there! A bright light shone
   between the wings of the cherubim and so the Psalmist, in later days
   spoke unto the Lord saying, "You that dwells between the cherubim shine
   forth." Above the sacred tent was the pillar of fire by night and the
   pillar of cloud by day--an emblem of the constant Presence of God, for
   all through the wilderness His glorious marching was in the center of
   the armies of His Israel. The desert sand glowed with the blaze of the
   present Deity! No spot on earth was so like to Heaven's high courts as
   that wilderness the Lord, Himself, led His people like a flock. Holy
   was Horeb, for the Lord was there! Then were the days of Israel's
   espousals, for the Most High tabernacled among her tribes and made them
   "a people near unto Him."

   In Canaan, itself, the days of sorrow came when the nation went after
   other gods and the Lord became a stranger in the land. When He
   returned, and delivered His people by the Judges, then the nations knew
   that Israel could not be trampled on, for the Lord was there. This was
   the Glory of David's reign. Then the Lord made bare His arm and the
   enemies of His chosen were driven like snow from the bleak sides of
   Salmon when the rough blast carries it away. This was the shout of the
   joyful people, "The Lord of Hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our
   refuge!" Never were the hills of Judah more fruitful, nor the vales of
   Sharon more peaceful, nor the homes of Israel more restful, nor the
   sons of Zion more valiant than when to the harp of David the song was
   raised, "They have seen Your goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
   my King, in the sanctuary. This is the hill which God desires to dwell
   in; yes, the Lord shall dwell in it forever."

   You remember how, in later ages, when Solomon was crowned and his reign
   of peace had been inaugurated, he built for God a Temple adorned with
   gold and precious stones, and all manner of cunning, work of the
   artificer? But it was not

   that glittering roof, it was not those massive pillars of brass in the
   forefront, it was not the hecatombs of bullocks whose blood was poured
   forth at the altar which were the glory of the Temple on Mount Zion.
   Beautiful for situation, it was the joy of the whole earth, but its
   Glory lay in this--"God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:
   God shall help her, and that right early." The excellence of the Temple
   was seen when, on the opening day, the Lord revealed Himself and the
   cloud filled the House of the Lord, so that the priests could not stand
   to minister because of the cloud--for the "Glory of the Lord had filled
   the House of the Lord." Little remains for man to do when in, very
   deed, the Lord dwells in the midst of His saints. Apart from priests
   and ceremonies, that place is sacred wherein the Lord Most High has His
   abode. Say of any place, "Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord Is There," and be
   it tent or temple, you have spoken glorious things of it!

   I almost tremble while I remind you of the truest Temple of God--the
   body of our Lord. The nearest approach of Godhead to our manhood was
   when there was found, wrapped in swaddling bands and lying in a manger,
   that Child who was born, that Son who was given, whose name was called,
   "Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The
   Prince of Peace." As for you, O Bethlehem, favored above all the towns
   of earth, out of you He came, who is Immanuel, God With Us! Verily,
   Your name is Jehovah-Shammah! All along, through 30 years and more of
   holy labor, ending in a shameful death, God was, in Christ, reconciling
   the world unto Himself. In the gloom of Gethsemane, among those somber
   olives, when Jesus bowed and in His prayer sweat, as it were, great
   drops of blood falling to the ground, He was "seen of angels" as the
   Son of God bearing human sin! Speak of Gethsemane and we tell you God
   was there! Before Herod, Pilate, Caiaphas and on the Cross--the Lord
   was there! Though, in a sense, there was the hiding of God, and Jesus
   cried, "Why have You forsaken Me?" yet in the deepest sense Jehovah was
   there, bruising the great Sacrifice. The thick darkness made a veil for
   the Lord of Glory and behind it, He that made all things bowed His head
   and said, "It is finished." God was in Christ Jesus on the Cross, and
   we, beholding Him, feel that we have seen the Father. O Calvary, we say
   of you, "The Lord is there."

   Here I might fitly close, for we can mount no higher, but yet we could
   not afford to leave out those other dwellings of the Invisible Spirit
   who still, by His Presence, makes holy places even in this unholy
   world! We have to remind you that God is the Glory of the most glorious
   living thing that has been on the face of the earth since our Lord was
   here. And what is that? I answer, Jesus is gone--the Prophets are gone
   and we have no Temple, no human priest, no material Holy of Holies--

   "Jesus, wherever Your people meet, There they behold Your Mercy Seat!
   Wherever they seek You, You are found, And everyplace is hallowed
   ground."

   And yet there is a special place where God dwells among men and that is
   in His Church. He has but one--one Church, chosen by eternal election,
   redeemed by precious blood, called out by the Holy Spirit and quickened
   into newness of life--this, as a whole, is the dwelling place of the
   Covenant God! Because God is in this Church, therefore the gates of
   Hell shall not prevail against her.

   "The Lord is there" might be said of the Church in all ages. I have
   seen the crypts and underground chapels of the catacombs. And it made
   me feel that they were glorious places when I remembered that the Lord
   God was there, by His Spirit, with His suffering people--when holy hymn
   and Psalm and solemn prayer went up from the very heart of the earth
   from men who were hunted to the death by their foes--the Lord was
   there! In those dreary excavations, unvisited by sunlight and wholesome
   air, God was as He was not in the palaces of kings and is not in the
   cathedrals of priests! In this land of ours, when a few people met
   together, here and there, to hear the Gospel and to worship, they made
   cottages, caves and hollows in the woods to be "holiness unto the
   Lord."

   Yes, and when crowds met beneath your Gospel oaks, or gathered together
   by the hillside to listen to the pure Word of Grace, the Lord was there
   and souls were saved and sanctified! When the Puritans solemnly
   conversed together of the things of God and held their little
   conventicles for fear of their adversaries--God was there! On
   Scotland's bleak moors and mosses, when the Covenanters gathered in the
   darkness and the storm for fear of Claverhouse and his dragoons-- God
   was there! Those who wrote in those days tell us that they never knew
   such seasons in days of peace as they enjoyed among the hills, amid the
   heather, or by the brook--for Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord was there! And
   so onward, to this very day, wherever the chosen of God lift up holy
   hands and worship Him, whether it is in cathedral or in barn, beneath

   the blue sky or beneath a thatched roof--anywhere and everywhere when
   the heart is right and the soul adores the living Lord, this is the
   special Glory of the place--"Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord Is There!"

   Flying forward, as with a dove's wing, to the future that is drawing
   near, we think of the Truth of God that there is to be a millennial
   age--a time of glory, peace, joy, truth and righteousness. But what is
   to be the Glory of it? Why this, "Jehovah-Shammah, the Lord Is There!"
   The Lord Jesus Christ will come and begin His personal reign on earth
   among His ancients. In like manner, as He went up into Heaven, and the
   disciples saw Him, so will He descend a second time, to be seen here
   among men. And His glorious Presence shall fashion the golden age, the
   thousand years of peace! Then shall the nations shout, "The Lord Is
   Come!" What hallelujahs will then rise to Heaven! Welcome, welcome, Son
   of God! How will all His faithful ones rejoice with unspeakable joy and
   sing and sing again, for now the day of their reward has come and they
   shall shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father! In all the
   Glory of the latter days everything is wrapped up in this one phrase,
   "the Lord is there."--

   "Oh, come, You Day-Spring, come and cheer

   Our spirits by Your advent here!

   Disperse the gloomy clouds of night

   And death's dark shadows put to flight!

   Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel

   Shall come to you, O Israel!"

   Up yonder, where many of our beloved ones have already gone--up yonder,
   within that gate of pearl where eyes cannot, as yet, see, what is it
   that makes Heaven with all its supreme delights? Not harps of angels,
   nor blaze of seraphim! Just this one fact, "the Lord is there." What
   must it be to be with God? O soul that loves Him, what will your
   fullness of pleasure be when you shall dwell with Him for whom your
   soul is hungering and thirsting! What joy to be "forever with the
   Lord!" This perfect bliss may be ours this very day! We little know how
   near we are to our glorification with our Lord. The veil is very thin
   that parts the sanctified from the glorified--

   "One gentle sigh, the soul awakes--

   We scarcely can say, 'he's gone,'

   Before the ransomed spirit takes

   Its mansion near the Throne."

   The joy and glory of those Divine mansions is that "the Lord is there."
   Heaven's loftiest peak shines forever in this clear light--The Lord God
   and the Lamb are the Light thereof--"the Lord is there."

   Enough of this. I have proved my point, that the Glory of the most
   glorious place is that "the Lord is there."

   II. Suffer me for a few minutes to speak to you upon another point--THE
   PRESENCE OF GOD IS THE BEST PRIVILEGE OF HIS CHURCH. It is her glory
   that "the Lord is there." Note this, and mark it well. Brothers and
   Sisters, we as a Church have grown to great numbers and we are not
   deficient, either, in gifts or in Graces, or in work for our Lord. But
   let me solemnly remind you always that our chief, our only strength,
   must always lie in this--"the Lord is there." If the Lord should depart
   from us, as He has gone from churches which are now apostate, what an
   abyss opens before us! If He should take His Holy Spirit from us, even
   as the Glory departed from the Temple at Jerusalem, then our ruin would
   become a thing to mention with dread, a case to be quoted for a warning
   to future generations! O Lord, our God, take not Your flight! Abide
   with us, we pray You! Our only hope lies in Your making the place of
   Your feet glorious among us!

   If the Lord is among us, the consequences will be, first, the
   conservation of true doctrine. The true God is not with a lie--He will
   not give His Countenance to falsehood. Those who preach other than
   according to His Word, abide not under His blessing and are in great
   danger of His curse. If any man speaks another gospel (which is not
   another, but there are some that trouble us), God is not with him--and
   any transient prosperity which he may enjoy will be blown away as the
   chaff. God is with those who faithfully speak His Truth, hold it
   devoutly, believe it firmly and live upon it as their daily bread. May
   it always be said of this Church, "the Lord is there," and, therefore,
   they are sound in the faith, reverent towards Holy Scripture and
   zealous for the honor of Christ! Trust-deeds and confessions of faith
   are useful in their way, even as laws are useful to society, but as
   laws cannot secure obedience to themselves, so articles of belief
   cannot create faith, or secure honesty. And to men without conscience,
   they are not worth the paper they are written upon. No subscription to
   articles can keep out the unscrupulous! Wolves leap into the fold
   however carefully you watch the door. The

   fact is, the most of people say, "Yes, that doctrine is in the creed
   and is not to be denied, but you need not preach it. Put it on the
   shelf as an ornament and let us hear no more about it." Truth must be
   written on the heart as well as in the book! If the Lord is among His
   people, they will cling to the eternal Truths of God and love the
   doctrine of the Cross, not by force of law, but because Divine Truth is
   the life of their souls.

   Where God is present, the preservation of purity will be found. The
   Church is nothing if it is not holy. It is worse--it is a den of
   thieves! Setting the seal of its pestilent example upon evil living, it
   becomes the servant of Satan and the destroyer of souls. Who is to keep
   the Church pure? None but God, Himself. If the Lord is there, holiness
   will abound and fruits of the Spirit will be seen on all sides. But if
   the Lord is once withdrawn, then flesh and blood will rule and gender
   towards corruption, after its own manner--and the church will become a
   synagogue of formalists. Pray, my Brothers and Sisters, continually,
   that the Lord may dwell in our Zion, to maintain us in all holy
   obedience and purity of life!

   Where God is, there is the constant renewal of vitality. A dead church
   is a reeking Golgotha, a breeding place of evils, a home of devils. The
   tombs may be newly whitewashed, but they are none the less open
   sepulchers, haunts of unclean spirits. A Church all alive is a little
   Heaven, the resort of angels, the Temple of the Holy Spirit. In some of
   our churches everybody seems to be a little colder than everybody else.
   The members are holy icicles! A general frost has paralyzed everybody
   and though some are colder than others, yet all are below zero! There
   are no flowing rills of refreshment. Everything is bound hard and fast
   with the frost of indifference. Oh, that the Lord would send forth His
   wind and melt the glaciers! Oh, that the Spirit of God would chase
   winter out of every heart and every church! No human power can keep a
   church from the frostbite which numbs and kills. Unless the Lord is
   there, growth, life, warmth are all impossible. You that make mention
   of the Lord, keep not silent and give Him no rest, but cry day and
   night to Him, "O Lord, abide with us! Go forth with our armies! Make us
   to be the living children of the living God!"

   When the Lord is there, next, there is continuing power. With God there
   is power in the ministry, power in prayer, power in all holy work. We
   may do a vast deal of work and yet nothing may come of it, but, on the
   other hand, we may only be able to do comparatively little and yet
   great results may flow from it, for results depend not on the quantity
   of the machinery, but on the Presence of the Lord!

   Do you not all know persons who are not peculiarly gifted and yet are
   eminently useful? You do not remark anything about them that is
   specially noticeable and yet their whole career enlists attention by
   its power. Their words are effective, for there is character behind
   them. A consistent life gives force to a plain testimony. It is not so
   much what is said as who says it! And that is not all--God, Himself, is
   at the back of the man who is living for Him. He causes him to speak in
   His name so that none of his words fall to the ground. Is it not said
   of the godly, "His leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does
   shall prosper"? This is so with every Church where the Lord abides. His
   Presence makes it a power with its children and adherents, a power with
   the neighborhood and a power with the age. Its example, its testimony,
   its effort is effective! God uses it and, therefore, it answers its
   end. The power is with God--but the Church is the instrument by which
   that power exercises itself. He uses a living people for the display of
   living power and He gives to them, both life and power, more and more
   abundantly. As we desire power with which to labor for God, we must
   pray that the God of Power will remain in our midst.

   Furthermore, whenever it can be said of an assembly, "the Lord is
   there," unity will be created and fostered. Show me a church that
   quarrels, a church that is split up into cliques, a church that is
   divided with personal ambitions, contrary doctrines and opposing
   schemes--and I am sure that the Lord is not there. Where there are
   envying, jealousies, suspicions, backbiting and dislikes, I know that
   the Holy Dove, who hates confusion, has taken His flight. God is Love
   and He will only dwell where love reigns. He is the God of Peace and
   will not endure strife. The children of God should be knit together. It
   would be a shameful sight, indeed, should children of His family fall
   out and chide and fight. Saints who dwell with God love each other
   "with a pure heart, fervently." Some professors act as if they hated
   each other! I may not say, "with a pure heart," but I will say,
   "fervently." Where God is present, the Church is edified in love and
   grows up, like a building fitly framed together, to be a holy Temple in
   the Lord. Oh, for more of this unity!

   Where the Lord is, there is sure to be happiness. What meetings we have
   when the Lord is here! It is a Prayer Meeting, but when you have said
   that, you have not fully described it, for it is far more. It was an
   unusual meeting for prayer, for, God being there, every prayer was
   spoken into His ear and all the desires and petitions of the saints
   were prompted by His Holy Spirit! Why, the very room was lit up with
   the Glory of the Lord! And whether we were in Heaven or not,

   we could hardly tell! What happy times we have in preaching the Word of
   the Lord when God's own Presence is realized! His paths drop fatness.
   What joyous seasons we have frequently enjoyed at the Communion Table!
   The provision is but bread and wine, but when, by faith, we perceive
   the real and spiritual Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the
   breaking of the bread we eat His flesh, and in the fruit of the vine we
   drink His blood! When we have gathered in the Lord's Presence we have
   sung--

   "No beams of cedar or of fir Can with Your courts on earth compare! And
   here we wait, until Your love Raises us to nobler seats above." At the
   Master's Table I have often been so blessed that I would not have
   exchanged places with Gabriel! The Lord was there--what more could I
   desire? Joy, delight, rapture, ecstasy--what word shall I use?--all
   these have waited around the Table of Fellowship, as musicians at a
   king's banquet. If God is there, our Heaven is there!

   III. I shall now close by noticing, in the third place, that since this
   Presence of God is the Glory of the most glorious place and the choice
   privilege of the most privileged, it is our exceeding joy. THE PRESENCE
   OF THE LORD IS OUR DELIGHT IN EVERY PLACE.

   We will think of our own dear homes. What a delightful family we belong
   to if it can be said of our house, "Jehovah-Shammah, The Lord Is
   There"! Has it a thatched roof and a stone floor? What does it matter?
   The father of the family lives near to God and his wife rejoices to be
   his fellow-helper in prayer, while the children grow up to honest toil
   and honorable service. Assuredly that cottage home is dear to God and
   becomes a place where angels come and go! Because God is there, every
   window looks towards the Celestial City. It is a comfort that we need
   not go across the road to morning prayer, or step out every evening to
   worship, for we are priests, ourselves, and have a family altar at home
   where the incense burns both morning and night. We talk not of matins
   and vespers, but we glory that "the Lord is there" when we bow the knee
   as a household!

   What is more delightful than to gather round the family hearth to hear
   the Scriptures read and listen to the senior, as he talks to the
   younger ones, of what God has done for him and what the Lord is waiting
   to give to all who trust Him? Free from all formality, family prayer
   makes a house a temple, a family a church and every day a holy day!
   Truly, I may say of families of this kind, wherever they dwell, that it
   is "none other but the House of God, and it is the very gate of
   Heaven," for, "the Lord is there." Friend, is God in your house? If it
   has no family prayer, it has no roof to it. There is no true joy in
   domestic life unless the Lord is there. All else is fiction! God alone
   is true delight. I charge you, if your homes are not such that God
   could come to them, set your houses in order and say, "As for me and my
   house, we will serve the Lord." Will you dare to dwell where God could
   not lodge with you? May all men say of your home, "The Lord is there!"

   Here is a Christian who lives alone, altogether apart from family life.
   All his dear ones are dead, or far away. In his lone chamber, when he
   bows his knee in secret prayer, or whenever he takes his walk abroad to
   meditate, if he is, indeed, a true lover of the Lord Jesus, "the Lord
   is there." Wherever the Believer's lot is cast, if he lives in
   fellowship with Christ, he may say of his quiet room, or of the garden
   walk, or even of the stable or the loft, "Jehovah-Shammah, The Lord Is
   There." Many a humble attic is a right royal residence, for, "the Lord
   is there." Better Paul's inner dungeon at Philippi, with his feet fast
   in the stocks--and the Presence of the Lord--than the most grand
   apartment of Caesar's palace and an unknown god! The Lord is very
   gracious to His lonely ones. They can say, "And yet I am not alone, for
   the Father is with me." In a hospital, or in a workhouse--what does it
   matter if Jehovah is at your side to cheer you?

   Some of us can bear witness that we have had the nearest approaches of
   God to our souls in times of intolerable pain and even in seasons of
   intense depression of spirit as to earthly things. "I was brought low,
   and the Lord helped me," said David. And we can say the same. The Lord
   has said, "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you," as
   much as to say, "If I am not with you anywhere else, I will be with you
   then." In the furnace, one like unto the Son of God was seen. If
   Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego never had that glorious fourth Person in
   their company before, they had Him when they were cast into the midst
   of the glowing coals! Jehovah-Shammah makes a seven-times-heated
   furnace a pleasant arbor! We may say of the refining fire, of the
   threshing floor and of the oil-press, "God has been there!" In the time
   of trouble He has been a very present help. One might almost say, "Send
   me back to my prison," as one did say who lost

   God's Presence after he had gained his liberty! One might well cry,
   "Ah, let me have back my pain if I may again overflow with the joy of
   the Lord's Presence."

   Dear Friends, I thank God that you and I know what it is to enjoy the
   Presence of God in a great many different ways. When two or three of
   the people of God meet together and talk to one another about the
   things of God, the Lord is never away. You remember that blessed text,
   "They that feared the Lord spoke often, one to another." They had holy
   talks about heavenly things. It was such sweet conversation that the
   Lord, Himself, turned eaves-dropper and listened and heard. What He
   heard pleased Him so well that He, then and there, made a note of it.
   Yes, and wrote it down and ordered that "a book of remembrance" should
   be preserved "for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His
   name." Was not this sure evidence of His most gracious Presence? John
   Bunyan knew that God was there when he went about tinkering and came to
   Bedford--and there were three godly women sitting in the sun, at
   work--and as they worked they talked so sweetly that the tinker stood
   and listened and was drawn to better things! By such means he became a
   Believer and a preacher--and the writer of the "Pilgrim's
   Progress"--which has so refreshed us all. The Lord was there and,
   therefore, he dreamed a heavenly dream in Bedford jail. Wherever His
   people meet, the Lord is graciously near. "Where two or three are
   gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them."

   Yes, but when Christian people go forth to work--when you come to your
   Sunday school, or go out with your bundle of tracts, to hand them out
   in your district, or when you join a little band and stand on the
   street corner, yonder, and lift up your voice in the name of Jesus--you
   may expect, if you go with prayer and faith, that it shall be written,
   "Jehovah-Shammah, The Lord Is There." It is only a young man standing
   up in a cottage to speak and he has not much to say, yet there are
   penitential tears and broken hearts--it is so, for God is there! It is
   only a humble woman speaking to a few persons of her own class and yet
   angels are rejoicing over a repenting sinner--yes, because God is
   there! It is only a little room in one of our back streets and the city
   missionary has come in. There are a dozen or two of the neighbors
   called together and he is talking of Jesus and His love--oh, but if the
   Lord is there, do not tell me that the missionary is not in the
   Apostolic succession--he need not claim it, he is, himself, an Apostle
   of God to those poor people! He needs no gorgeous vestments, nor the
   swell of an organ, nor even the thunders of the multitude as they raise
   the solemn hymn! The few so simple and so poor have God with them and
   it is enough! Wherever you are seeking to do good, in prayerful
   dependence upon the Holy Spirit, it shall be said "the Lord is there."

   And now, from this time forth, Beloved, you that fear God and think
   upon His name, wherever you go, let it be said, "Jehovah-Shammah, The
   Lord Is There." I often feel sorry when the Sabbath is nearly over and
   so do many of you. I know you wake on Monday morning and take those
   shutters down, again, or go off to that workshop where you suffer so
   much ridicule, or return to the ordinary grind of daily labor and mix
   up with so many of the ungodly--and you do it mournfully. Now, pray
   that you may keep up the Sabbath tone all week! Make every place,
   wherever you go, to be the House of God. A dear Brother of ours went to
   a shop where he worked with four ungodly men--and his Lord went with
   him. It was not long before we had the privilege of baptizing that
   friend's master and all his shop mates, for the Lord was there! The
   other day there came a fresh man to work who could not bear to hear a
   word upon religion, but our Brother was the means of his conversion,
   too, and the new man is coming among us, warm with his first love! Our
   Brother made up his mind that he was not going to be conquered by any
   scoffers, but, on the contrary, he was determined to conquer them for
   Christ! He will not yield to the influences of sin, but he resolves, in
   the name of the Lord, that evil influences shall yield to the power of
   the Truth of God and to the attractions of the Cross. Write across your
   workshop, "The Lord is here." If you cannot do it literally, do it
   spiritually, "Jehovah-Shammah, The Lord Is There."

   Do not be found anywhere where you could not say that the Lord was
   there! If you are called into the world in the pursuit of your daily
   vocation, cry unto the Lord, "If Your Spirit goes not with me, carry me
   not up hence." Determine that you will have the Spirit of God with you
   and, if it is in busy Cheapside, or in the lonesome country while you
   are hoeing the turnips or attending to a flock of sheep--in any field,
   any street, or any room--it shall be said that God is there! Take Jesus
   with you when you go and, when you come home, may His Spirit still be
   with you! God grant that it may be so! The Holy Spirit can work you to
   this!

   What shall I say to those who do not know the Lord and do not care for
   Him? O Friend, the day will come in which Jesus Christ will say to you,
   "I never knew you: depart from Me, you workers of iniquity." Do not let
   Him say that, but, tonight, commence an acquaintance with Him. May His
   Holy Spirit help you to do so! I am sure the Lord Jesus Christ

   could not say to me, "I never knew you." It is impossible, because I
   could reply to Him, "Never knew me, Lord? Why, I have been to You with
   so many burdens. I have run to You with so many troubles that I am sure
   You know me as one knows a beggar whom he has relieved many times a
   day--

   'Do You ask me who I am? Ah, my Lord! You know my name.' You remember
   me, for in my despair I cried to You and You did relieve me of my
   burden! You know me, for in my sorrow, my broken heart found no comfort
   but in You! You have known me all these years in which I have had to
   cry to You for something to preach about, and for help while preaching.
   You know how I have had to come to You and confess my failures, and
   mourn my shortcomings, and lament my sins, and trust in Your blood for
   cleansing."

   My Lord cannot say that He does not know me, for He has known my soul
   in adversity. Blessed be His name, I know Him and lean all my weight
   upon Him! They that know Him shall be with Him and He will receive them
   unto Himself forever--and this shall be their Glory--"Jehovah-Shammah,
   The Lord Is There." With Him shall they dwell, world without end! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Isaiah45:8-25. HYMNS FROM "OUR
   OWN HYMN BOOK"--774, 847, 806.

   LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON:

   DEAR FRIENDS--In this, the beginning of another year, I find myself in
   Mentone gradually recovering health after a period of pain and
   weakness. To begin Volume 37 of weekly sermons has fallen to the lot of
   no other man. I am grateful for the peculiar privilege and all the more
   so because all the previous 36 volumes continue to be purchased and
   read, and preached. I beg each friendly reader to breathe a prayer for
   the preacher and for these hundreds of sermons, that the Lord may use
   both the living voice and the printed page to His own Glory and to the
   salvation of men. Man's thoughts change, but the Word of the Lord
   endures forever--and this is the Word which in these sermons is
   preached to men. May the Holy Spirit acknowledge the testimony! Wishing
   to all my readers A HAPPY NEW YEAR, I am their servant for Christ's
   sake, C. H. SPURGEON.

A Gracious Dismissal

   (No. 2183)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 11, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace." Luke
   7:50.

   THE main part of my subject will be--that gracious dismissal, "Go in
   peace." To her who had been so lately blessed, the word, "Go," sounded
   mournfully, for she would gladly have remained through life with her
   pardoning Lord, but the added words, "in peace," turned the wormwood
   into honey--there was now peace for her who had been so long hunted and
   harried by her sins! Rising from the feet she had washed with tears,
   she went forth to keep her future footsteps such as those of a
   believing and, therefore, saved woman ought to be.

   We like a motto to begin the year with and it has been useful to some
   spirits to choose a motto with which to enter on a new course of life.
   We climb the hill of enterprise, or dare the wave of trial with an
   inspiring word upon our lips. To certain young men, a word has come in
   life's early morning, wet with the dew of Heaven--and that word of
   their dawn of day has stayed with them. The echoes of that life-evoking
   word have followed them long after it was spoken. Amid strange scenes
   it has come to them like a voice from the unseen. It has whispered to
   them within the curtains of their dying bed--it has murmured
   consolation amid Jordan's swelling waves. That first word of joy and
   peace from Jesus with which they began the new life came to them,
   again, just as they were melting away into the invisible land. And so
   they began the service of the Redeemer--and so He declared that their
   work was finished. Perhaps that love-note will be their welcome at the
   very gates of Heaven!

   Our Lord, in the instance before us, sent a penitent away from the
   chill atmosphere of self-righteous quibbling and thus relieved her of a
   controversy for which she was not fitted. But I see more than that in
   this benediction. It looks to me as if our Divine Master, when He found
   this poor sinner so full of love to Him that she washed His feet with
   tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, having by a parable
   explained to the Pharisee the reason for the greatness of her love,
   then said to her, "Go in peace,"--meaning that word not only to be
   cheering for the necessary purpose of the moment, but to go with her
   and to attend her all the rest of her life, until, when she came into
   the dark valley, she should fear no evil, for she would still hear that
   sweet voice saying, "Go in peace." What music to have heard! What music
   still to hear!

   Now, I would to God that the word which I shall speak at this time
   might be honored of the Lord to serve that sacred purpose to some here
   present. May it be a life-word to certain of you! May it be to others
   of us who have long known the Savior a revival of our rest--and may we
   get such a draught of peace from Jesus that we may never thirst again!
   The lips of our Divine Lord are a wellspring of delight! Each word is a
   chalice brimmed with sweetness. Imbibing this, we shall go our way,
   even to our journey's end, after the manner of the hymn which we sang
   just now--

   "Calm in the hour of buoyant health,

   Calm in my hour of pain;

   Calm in my poverty or wealth,

   Calm in my loss or gain.

   Calm me, my God, and keep me calm,

   Softly resting on Your breast,

   Soothe me with holy hymn and Psalm,

   And bid my spirit rest."

   Oh, that our life may be as a sea of glass! May the sacred circle of
   our fellowship be within the golden line of the peace of God! You who
   did bid us come to You and rest, now bid us, "go in peace."

   I am going to say a little in my opening upon a delightful assurance
   which constituted the reason why the woman went in peace--"Your faith
   has saved you;" or, as in the 48th verse, "Your sins are forgiven you."
   Upon the strength of the assurance that she was saved, she might safely
   go in peace! When we have talked a little upon that subject, we will
   then come to a considerate precept--the Savior directed her, in the
   moment of trial, to, "go in peace." There was an assurance for her
   comfort and a precept for her guidance.

   I. First, then, consider A DELIGHTFUL ASSURANCE. The ground upon which
   the penitent woman might go in peace was that she had been saved. The
   Savior assured her--"Your faith has saved you."

   She was not saved by any other way than we are saved, but she received
   the common salvation by like precious faith. The way of salvation to
   her was faith in Christ--that is the same way for us, but she had what
   some of you, no doubt, would greatly like to have--she had an assurance
   that she was saved from the Lord's own mouth! I think I hear some
   saying, "I should go in peace, I am sure, if the Lord Jesus would but
   appear to me and speak, and say with His own lips, "Your faith has
   saved you." It is natural that you should think so. It must have been
   rapture to receive a benediction from the mouth of our King, our
   Savior! Yet, dear Friends, we must not hang our confidence upon a mere
   circumstance. For a mere circumstance it is, whether Christ shall
   literally stand before you in the flesh and say, "Your faith has saved
   you," or whether He shall say it to you by the Infallible record of His
   own Word.

   It does not make much difference as to my faith in what my father says
   to me, whether I meet the venerable man in the morning in my garden and
   there hear his voice, or whether I get a letter by post in his
   handwriting, and he says to me upon that paper just what he would have
   said if I had met him face to face. I do not require him to always come
   up the hill to my house to tell me everything that he has to say--I
   should think myself an idiot if I did! If I were to say, "My dear
   Father, you have assured me of your love by letter, but somehow, I
   cannot credit it unless you come and look me in the face and take my
   hand and assure me of your good will." Surely, he would say to me, "My
   dear Son, what ails you? You must be out of your mind. I never knew you
   to be so childish before! My handwriting has always been enough. I can
   hardly think you mean it when you say that you cannot credit me unless
   I stand manifest before your eyes--and with your ears you hear me
   speak."

   Now, what I would not do to my earthly father, I certainly would not do
   to my heavenly Savior! I am perfectly satisfied to believe what He
   writes to me and if it is so written in His Book, it seems to me to be
   quite as true and sure as if He had actually come from Heaven and had
   talked with me, or had appeared to me in the visions of the night. Is
   not this the reasoning of commonsense? Do you not at once agree with
   me?

   "Well," you say, "we go with you there, dear Sir, but, then, He spoke
   that word to her personally. We would never have any more doubts, but
   would go in peace if He said that word of assurance to us. You see, it
   is not merely that Jesus, Himself, spoke and said, 'Your faith has made
   you whole,' but He looked that way! He turned towards her and she knew
   that He referred to her. There was no mistaking to whom the assurance
   was given! There were other people in the room, but He did not say it
   to Simon. He did not say it to Peter. He did not say it to James and
   John. She knew by the look of Him that He meant it for her and for her,
   alone, for she was the only person to go and, consequently, the only
   one to 'go in peace.' Our Lord put it in the singular number and said,
   'Your faith has saved you.' I want it to come home just so to

   me."

   Yes, but I think that this is a little unreasonable, is it not? Because
   if my father (to carry on my figure) were to speak to me, and to my
   brothers, and to my sisters, and were to say, "Dear children, I have
   loving thoughts concerning you, and I have laid up in store for your
   needs," I do not think that I should say to him, by-and-by, "Now,
   Father, do you know that I did not believe you, or derive any pleasure
   from what you said because you spoke to others beside myself? I did not
   think your statement of love could be true because you included my
   brothers and my sisters. You did not use the singular, but you put it
   in the plural--and you spoke to all my brothers and sisters, as well as
   to myself--and, therefore, I felt that I could not take any comfort out
   of your tender assurances." I should be a most unreasonable kind of
   person if I were to talk in that way--and my father would begin to
   think that his son was qualifying for a lunatic asylum! If he did not
   attribute it to unkindness of heart, he certainly would ascribe it to
   stupidity of head! Why, surely, surely, if my father says the same to
   each one of his children as he says to me, his words are all the more
   likely to be true, instead of being less worthy of belief and,
   therefore, I derive comfort from his promises of love being put in the
   plural rather than in the sin-

   gular. Surely it should not be less easy to believe that God would deal
   graciously with me in company with thousands of others than that He
   should pursue a solitary plan with me as the lone object of His love.
   Is it not so?

   "Ah, yes!" says one, "but you have not hit on it yet. I want to know
   that I am one that is in that plural! And I want to know that I really
   am one of those to whom Jesus speaks in His Word." My anxious Friend,
   you may know it--and you may know it most certainly. It is written, "He
   that believes on Him has everlasting life." It need never be a question
   whether you believe in Him or not. If you trust Him, that is the gist
   of the matter. You can readily ascertain whether you do really trust
   Him, or do not trust Him. If you do trust Him, you are His, and every
   promise of His Covenant is made to you! You have faith, and when the
   Lord lays it down as a general statement that faith saves--the
   statement is applicable to all the world, in every place and in all
   time--until the present age shall end--and men shall have passed into
   the fixed state of retribution where no Gospel of faith is preached.
   "Your faith has saved you." If you have faith at all--if you believe
   that Jesus is the Christ--you are born of God! If you can say to the
   Lord Jesus--

   "Allmy trust on You is stayed All my help from You I bring," that is
   faith and Jesus testifies, "Your faith has saved you."

   Now, because the Infallible Witness says this of all who have faith, I
   do not think you ought to doubt it. It is true you do not hear His
   voice because He says it rather by the written Word than by word of
   mouth, but surely this does not affect your faith. We believe a true
   man whether he writes or speaks--indeed, if there is any choice, we
   prefer that which he has deliberately put on paper, for this remains
   when the sound of the voice is clean gone. It is most profitable for us
   that we should read our Lord's declaration over and over again--and put
   it in all sorts of shapes--and see how it always remains faithful and
   true. It is more assuring to you to find it in the volume of the Book
   than it would be if the Savior met you tonight, and said to you, "Your
   sins are forgiven you. Your faith has saved you." The record excels the
   voice.

   "No," you say, "I cannot see that." Well now, Peter was with Christ on
   the Mount of Transfiguration and nothing could shake Peter's conviction
   that he had been there in the midst of that heavenly Glory--and yet,
   for all that, Peter says, concerning the Inspired Word, "We have a more
   sure Word of testimony"! He felt that even the memory of that vision,
   which he had assuredly seen, did not always yield to him so much
   assurance as did the abidingly Inspired Word of God! You ought to feel
   the same. If I were conscious tonight that, at some period of my life,
   I had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken to me, the very spot of
   ground on which it occurred would be exceedingly dear and sacred to my
   spirit. But I am certain that when I grew depressed--when darkness
   rushed over my soul, as it sometimes does, I would be sure to say to
   myself--"You never saw anything of the kind! It was a delusion, a
   figment of your imagination, a delirium and nothing more."

   But, Beloved, when I get to this Book and see before me the sacred
   lines, I know that I am not deluded! There it stands, "God so loved the
   world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him
   should not perish, but have everlasting life." I am sure about that and
   I am sure that I believe and, therefore, I am sure that I am saved! I
   like to put my finger right down on the passage and then say, "Lord, I
   know You cannot lie. I have never had a question about this being Your
   Book. Whatever other doubts have plagued me, this has not. You have so
   spoken it home to my soul that I am as assured that this is Your Book
   as I am assured of my own existence. And, therefore, You have done
   better for the removal of my doubts and for the assurance of my soul's
   eternal salvation, by putting Your promise in your Book than if You
   had, Yourself, personally appeared to me and spoken with Your own
   voice."

   my Hearer, the written Word is most sure! If you believe, you are
   saved, as surely as you are alive. If you believe, Heaven and earth may
   pass away, but the Word of the Lord shall stand fast for you. "He that
   believes in Him has everlasting life." He has eternal life in present
   possession! Our Lord has put it thus--"He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." "He that with his heart believes and with his mouth
   makes confession of Him shall be saved." There are no, "ifs," or,
   "buts," about these Words of promise. Salvation is put as a present
   thing and as an abiding thing, but in every case as a certain thing!
   And why should we be worried and worn about the matter? It is so and
   let us take the comfort of the fact. We must either throw away this
   Book by beginning to talk about "degrees of inspiration" and all that
   foul rubbish, or else we are logically bound to be sure of our hope and
   to rejoice in it!

   1 guarantee you, O my Hearer, that as long as you stand fast by the
   belief that this is a sure Word of testimony, you will know that you
   are saved! If this Book is true, every Believer in Jesus is as safe as
   Jesus, Himself. To say, "I believe, but

   I am afraid I am not saved," is to say, but in a roundabout way, that
   you do not believe at all! For, if you believe, then you believe that
   God speaks the Truth--and this is the testimony--"God has given us
   eternal life, and that life is in His Son." This is the testimony of
   the great Father and the testimony of the eternal Spirit! And we must
   not dare to doubt it. You may doubt whether you believe or not, but
   given that you do really and unfeignedly put your trust in the Lord
   Jesus, then, as effect follows cause, it is certain that the cause of
   faith will be followed by its sure effect--salvation! "Your faith has
   saved you; go in peace." Do not worry any longer--go in peace! Have
   done with questioning! End all debate-- go in peace. Go about your
   business, for the work of salvation is done! You are a saved soul--go
   and rejoice in finished salvation and ask no more questions. "Why do
   you cry you unto Me?" said God to Moses, "Speak unto the children of
   Israel, that they go forward." Why do you question and doubt any
   longer? Go forward to enjoy what God has prepared for you! And as you
   are saved and justified in Christ, now seek sanctification and all the
   other blessings of the Covenant of Grace which lie before you in Christ
   Jesus your Lord! The promise is sure--be sure that it is so--and in
   perfect rest of soul enjoy the good which God provides you!

   I think I have thus brought out as clearly as I can that delightful
   assurance which is the ground of the command, "Go in peace."

   II. We come, secondly, to listen to A CONSIDERATE PRECEPT. Our Lord,
   with wise tenderness, dismissed the beloved object of His pardoning
   love and bade her, "Go in peace." May the Holy Spirit bless this to us!
   This precept divides itself into two parts. There is, first, "Go." And
   then there is, "Go in peace." There is "go." Now, in, "go," there are
   two things--to go from and to go to. Where was she to go from? First,
   she was to go from these quibblers. Simon and the Pharisees are as full
   of objections as a swarm of bees is full of stings. They say in their
   hearts, one to another, "Who is this that also forgives sins?" They
   have even dared to question the Character of the Perfect One and have
   hinted a suspicion of His purity for allowing such a woman to come so
   near Him and to wash His feet with her tears. Therefore the Savior says
   to her, "Go." This was not a happy place for a childlike love to linger
   in. Her soul would have been among lions. Jesus seems to say, "Do not
   stay to be tormented by these quibblers. Your faith has saved you--go.
   You have gained a great blessing--go home with it. Let these people
   argue with each other. You have a rich prize--take it out of the reach
   of these pirates."

   Oftentimes I believe that the child of God would find it to be his
   greatest wisdom, whenever he is in company that begins to assail his
   Lord, or to denounce his faith, just to go about his business and let
   the scoffers have their scoffing to themselves. Some of us have thought
   it our miserable duty to read certain books that have been brought out
   against the Truth of God, that we might be able to answer them--but it
   is a perilous calling. The Lord have mercy upon us when we have to go
   down into these sewers--for the process is not healthy!

   "Oh," says a man, "but you must prove all things!" Yes, so I will. But
   if one should set a joint of meat on his table and it smelt rather
   high, I would cut a slice, but if I put one bit of it in my mouth and
   found it far gone, I would not feel it necessary to eat the whole round
   of beef to test its sweetness! Some people seem to think that they must
   read a bad book through--and they must go and hear a bad preacher often
   before they can be sure of his quality. Why, you can judge many
   teachings in five minutes! You say to yourself, "No, Sir, no, no, no!
   This is good meat--for dogs! Let them have it, but it is not good meat
   for me and I do not intend to poison myself with it." The Savior does
   not tell the woman, "Stop, now, and hear what Simon has got to say.
   Dear good woman, you have been washing My feet with tears and here is a
   highly intelligent gentleman, a Pharisee, who has a very learned speech
   to deliver--give him a fair hearing. You have to prove all
   things--therefore stay and hear him. And here are more gentlemen who
   object to My pardoning your sins. And their objections are fetched from
   deep veins of thought. Listen to them and then I will answer their
   questions and quiet your mind."

   No, the Savior says, "Go in peace. You have peace--do not stay till you
   lose it. You have your comfort and joy-- refuse to be robbed of them."
   Why, if you were in a room and you saw a certain number of gentlemen of
   a suspicious character--and you had your watch with you--you would not
   feel it necessary to stay and see whether they were able to extract
   your watch from you, but you would say to yourself, "No, I am best out
   of this company." We are safest out of the society of those whose great
   objective it is to rob us of our faith. "Your faith has saved you. Go
   home. Leave them. Go in peace."

   I think that He meant, besides going away from the men, "Go away from
   the publicity into which you have unwillingly stepped." If our Savior
   had been like some excellent people of the present day, He would have
   said, "Stand before all these men and tell your experience. I shall
   require you to be at half-a-dozen meetings this week and you must speak
   at every one of them." A splendid woman, was she not, who washed the
   Savior's feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head? She
   might have exhibited her eyes and her hair--and told their gracious
   story. Who can tell but several would have been impressed by the
   narrative? The Savior said to the woman--so excitable, for she was all
   that, as well as grate-ful--"Your faith has saved you; go in peace." As
   much as to say, "There are certain of your own sex that you can speak
   to. You will find some poor fallen woman to whom you can quietly tell
   of My pardoning Grace. But yours is a case in which the very beauty of
   your character will lie in the quietude of your future life. 'Your
   faith has saved you.' That is enough for you. You have come upon the
   stage of action by that splendid act of your love, but do not acquire
   the habit of winning publicity. Do not aspire to display yourself in a
   bold and heroic attitude, but go in peace." He almost seems to say,
   "Subside now into your family. Take your place with the rest of your
   sisters. Adorn, by your future purity, My doctrine, and let all men see
   what a change has been worked in you, for, perhaps that very weakness
   of yours which made you what you were as a sinner, may put you in
   danger, even as a saint. Therefore I do not ask you to tarry here and
   join My disciples, or follow Me publicly through the streets. But your
   faith has saved you; go in peace."

   I think that the Master taught a great deal of wisdom here, which some
   of those who are leaders in the Church of God would do well to copy.
   Yes, I think that I shall go a little further and say that I think the
   Savior, then and there, dismissed her from that high ministry which,
   for once in her life, she had carried out. She washed His feet with
   tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head. It was the action of a
   love which had risen to a passion. It was an action such as shall be
   told for a memory of her everywhere--and we may well imitate her
   penitence and her heroic courage, as well as her love to Christ. But,
   at the same time, we cannot always be doing heroic actions. Life is
   mainly made up of common deeds. It would not be possible to be always
   washing feet with tears, nor to be always unbraiding tresses to use
   them as a towel.

   The difficulty with some people is that they are always wanting to
   practice the sublime. Alas, they often fail by just one step and become
   ridiculous! They are always straining after effect and, hearing of what
   has been done once, by one choice person, they must do it themselves
   and they must keep on doing it! O my Sister, there may come a time when
   you will have to speak for Christ and speak openly before many, but
   tomorrow you had better go home and see to the children and make home
   happy for your husband. You will glorify Christ by darning stockings
   and mending the socks of the little ones, quite as surely as by washing
   His feet with tears. You make a great mistake if you have not a piety
   which will take you into domestic life--which will help you to make the
   common drudgery of life a Divine service. We need men who can serve God
   with the axe and plane, or behind a counter, or by driving a quill.
   These are the men we need--but there are many that crave to vault at
   once into a conspicuous place and perform an astounding deed! Having
   done it once, they become unsettled all the rest of their lives and do
   not seem as if they ever could take to plainly keeping the Ten
   Commandments and walking in the steps of Jesus. I wish that those who
   must flash and blaze would hear the Lord Jesus say to them, "Go in
   peace." I mean any of you who really did distinguish yourselves on one
   occasion and deserved much praise from your Christian friends. I fear
   lest you should pine for unusual and even undesirable forms of service
   and become useless in the ordinary course of life. Now, do not be
   spoiled for life by having been allowed in one unusual deed, but hear
   the Master say, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace. Serve Me in the
   daily avocations of life and bring glory to My name at home. Go from
   the strain of publicity to the gentler pressures of family duty."

   Do you not think that He even meant that she was now to cease from that
   singular fellowship with Him that she had enjoyed? She had been very
   close to Him, but she was, perhaps, never to be quite so near to Him
   again. In spirit she should be, but certainly not physically. It
   happens that those who take to the contemplative life--and there is no
   life higher than that--are apt to think that they must forget the
   practical life. But it must not be so. We must do that which the Master
   bids us do as well as sit at His feet! I am tempted to tell a story
   which most of you must know concerning the famous man of God, who, in
   his cell, thought he saw the Lord Jesus and, under that persuasion, he
   worshipped with rapt delight. But just then the bell at the convent
   gate rang and it was his turn to stand at the door and deal out bread
   to the hungry. There was a little battle in his mind as to which he
   should do--tarry with his Lord, or go to hand out bread to the poor
   mendicants. At last, he felt that he must do his duty even at the cost
   of the highest spiritual bliss. He went and distributed the bread and
   when he came back, to his great delight, the vision was still there and
   a voice said to him, "If

   you had stayed, I would have gone; but as you have gone, I have
   therefore stayed to commune with you." The path of duty must be
   followed and no spiritual enjoyment can excuse us from it! Never offer
   one duty to God stained with the blood of another! Balance your duties
   and let not one press out another. "Your faith has saved you; go in
   peace." Do not think that you need to be all day long at your Bible, or
   all the evening at your prayers. There is a time for everything. Let
   every holy work have its place, that your life may be a fair mosaic of
   brilliant colors, all set according to the Divine pattern, to make up a
   perfect character. "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace and do the
   next thing, and the next, without weariness."

   That leads me to speak of what she was to go to. It seems to me that
   the Savior said, "Now go home. You have been a fallen woman--home is
   the place for you. Go home to your mother and father, or other
   relatives. Seek a home. Be domesticated. Attend to your own work.
   Whatever your place is, go to it. Leaving daily duty was the source of
   your temptation--return to walks of usefulness and habits of order--and
   this will be your safety. You will be less likely to be led away if you
   have work to occupy head, heart and hands."

   Did He not mean, "Go now to your ordinary life-trial"? Do you think
   yourself a very peculiar person--a sort of saint that has to float in
   the air, or live upon roses? Do not fancy such a thing! I have heard of
   the Chinese, that they sell shoes with which you can walk on the
   clouds. And I believe that some people must have bought a pair of those
   remarkable articles, for their lives are spent in cloudland, walking as
   in a dream, upon high stilts of fond imaginations! Do not think great
   things of yourself. You are but a common man or woman. Do such duty as
   your fellow Christians do and do not think yourself a superior person.
   The worst people in the world to work with are superior people. Those
   are of no importance who think they are of great importance. Poor
   creature! It is not the Grace of God which turns your brain, but your
   own silly conceit.

   Go forth to your further service-- "Go in peace. There are some to whom
   you can tell of My love. Oh, how you will tell it! You that have washed
   My feet with your tears, go and shower those tears over fallen ones
   like yourself. Go, use those eyes, that you may look My love right into
   their hearts as you are speaking to them. Go all your life in peace and
   do for Me all that I shall put in your way to do for Me." That is what
   I think our Lord meant. Brothers and Sisters, do not think of sitting
   here to enjoy yourselves, but go off and glorify your Redeemer's name.
   Go!

   But then here is the point of it--He said, "Go in peace." O my Brothers
   and Sisters, I desire that all of us who love the Lord may go all the
   rest of our life journey in peace. May pardoning love put us at peace
   concerning all our sins! O pardoned one, you love much, for you have
   had much forgiven--let your thoughts all run to love--and none to fear.
   Fret not about the past--the dark, dishonorable past. The hand that was
   pierced has blotted it all out! The great Lord has frankly forgiven you
   all your debt. Let not that disturb you any longer. Go in peace! What a
   rest it is to be rid of the burden of sin and to know of a certainty,
   from the teaching of God's Word, that your sins are forgiven you! This
   is peace which passes all understanding.

   Our Lord meant, next, "Go in peace" in reference to all the criticisms
   of all these people who have looked at you. Do not mind them. Do not
   trouble about them. What have they to do with you? It is enough for a
   servant if his master accepts him--he need not mind what others have to
   say about his service. Your faith has saved you. Forget all the unkind
   things they have said and do not trouble your heart about the cruel
   speeches they may yet make. Go in peace and be under no alarm as to
   upbraiding tongues.

   And then I think He meant, "Go in peace about what you have done." I
   know the mood of a word like that. I have preached the Gospel. I have
   thrown my whole soul into it and after it is all over I have felt bound
   to chide myself that I did not do much better as to style, or spirit,
   or length, or some other matter. Oh, but if the Master accepts it, one
   may go in peace about it! This woman had done a very extraordinary
   thing in washing Christ's feet with tears, and wiping them with the
   hairs of her head. And when she got away, she might have said to
   herself, "I wonder why I was so bold? Was I not immodestly conspicuous?
   How could I have done it? How must I have looked when I was bathing His
   feet? For me, too--such a sinner as I am--for me to have done it to the
   Blessed and Holy One! I fear He must have felt vexed at my rudeness!"

   Have you not sometimes done a brave thing for Christ and then,
   afterwards, felt just like that. "I was a bold minx," you say, "after
   all, to push myself so forward." The good young man, who has just
   preached for the first time, says, "Well, I got through it this time,
   but I will never attempt it again, for I am sure that I am not fit for
   such holy work." So

   the Master says to this woman, "Go in peace. I have accepted you and
   your loving service. Do not be troubled about what you have done. It is
   all sweet to Me and has a rich perfume of your great love. Never fret
   about what you have done. You have done the right thing. Your faith has
   saved you. Go in peace." I want us to have just that kind of
   peace--peace about what we have done for our Lord, even as we have
   peace about forgiven sin and peace about human criticisms.

   "Go in peace." Oh, to possess, from this time forth, a holy quiet! We
   are so apt to grow fretful. I know some good Brothers and Sisters who
   have a swollen vein of suspicion about them that bleeds every now and
   then, and pains them greatly, and alarms other people. I know some
   Sisters--they are very good, but unreasonably fearful. They say that
   they are "nervous." Perhaps that is the fact and so I will say no more.
   But, oh, that we could get them cured of this disease of the nerves! I
   would they could be quieted! I admire the members of the Society of
   Friends for this virtue beyond almost any other which they
   exhibit--they seem to be so steady, self-contained and equable. They
   are a little slow, perhaps, but then they are very sure, firm,
   steadfast and calm. We are, some of us, too much in a hurry to go fast.
   If we were a little slower, we would be quicker. If we left our affairs
   more entirely with God, our peace might be like a river.

   Yes, I would to God, dear Friends, that we might feel a constant joy.
   Why not? Nothing ought to trouble us, for we know that all things work
   together for good. If we live by faith, nothing can trouble us, for
   between here and Heaven we shall keep company with You, You Blessed
   One! And if the way You take is rough, the fact of Your being with us
   shall make it smooth for us. We will travel merrily with this as our
   march music--"Your faith has saved you; go in peace."

   Still, to come back to where I began, I dare say that the good woman
   thought that she would like to speak a word for the Lord. When they
   said that He could not forgive sin, would not she have liked to say,
   "But He did forgive my sin and He changed my nature! How dare you speak
   thus"? But the Savior said, "Go." She was not called to contend. Thank
   God every child of God is not called to fight with the adversary--those
   of us who are men of war from our youth up take no pleasure in strife!
   We wish that, like this holy woman, we could be exempt from this
   warfare. She might well rejoice in her escape from the sacred
   conscription. Many a cuff and blow she thus avoided and, as her Captain
   sent her off the field, she might go home right happily.

   She might have lost the blessed frame of mind in which she then
   was--and this would have been a real injury to her. She was sweetly
   wrapped up in love and there her Lord would have her abide. He seems to
   say, "You are too precious to be battered and bruised in battle. Go--go
   in peace. Dear Soul, you are so full of love to Me that I do not want
   you to be worried with fighting, contending and arguing. Go in peace."
   She would have done no good, I dare say, if she had ventured into a
   fray for which she was so unfitted. If she had spoken, she would have
   said something which the cruel Pharisees would have turned into a jest.
   So He said to her, "Go in peace." Why should her feebleness give them
   an occasion for unholy triumph? All true hearts are not fit for fight.
   Besides, she had her Lord to be her Advocate, and there was no need for
   her to speak. Therefore He said, "I can manage them without your
   presence. Go in peace." When we may believingly leave a difficulty with
   our Lord, it is faith's duty to go home quietly. No doubt, by going in
   peace, she would be doing greater service than she would by using her
   tongue upon these ungodly men. A quiet, happy life is often the noblest
   witness that we can bear for Christ. Therefore I say to everyone who
   loves the Lord, there are times when He will say to us, "Do not enter
   into any of this conflict, turmoil and muddle. Your faith has saved
   you. Go in peace."

   The last word I have to say is this. There are many poor souls who talk
   about coming to Christ who are not yet saved. They are always hearing
   about faith and thinking of it--and yet they never do, in very truth,
   believe. Now, do not hear nor debate any more about faith, but believe.
   Trust Jesus Christ and think no more about your own trusting. Think
   about it as a thing done--not as a thing to be done! God help you now
   to believe in Jesus--and so pass over the bridge of belief to the
   golden shore of Jesus, Himself!

   Well, but I notice some say that they believe, but it is not believing,
   because if it were believing, they would "go in peace." A person comes
   to the bank with a check. He believes it to be honestly his and the
   signature to be correct. He puts it down on the counter and the clerk
   puts out the money. But look! The man does not take it. He stands and
   loafs about. The clerk looks at him, and wonders what he is doing. At
   last, when the person has been there long enough to wear the good man's
   patience out, the clerk says, "Did you bring that check to have the
   money?" "Yes, I handed it in." "Well, then, why do you not take the
   money and go about your business?" If he is a sensible man, he delays
   no longer--no, he would not have delayed so long. He takes the money
   and departs in peace.

   Now, dear Soul, if you have a promise from God--"He that believes is
   not condemned," or, "He that believes has everlasting life"--do you
   believe? Then take the blessing and go about your business! Do not keep
   on saying, "Perhaps it is so," and, "Perhaps it is not so." Do you
   believe that God speaks the Truth? If so, then take the promised
   blessing and enjoy it, for you are a saved man! "But I have been going
   to a place of worship for years and I have been believing in a sort of
   a way, but I have never dared to say that I was saved." Then you are
   acting the part of an unbeliever! If you do not know that you are
   saved, how dare you go to sleep tonight? How can a man dare to eat his
   meals and go about his business, and yet say, "I do not know whether I
   am saved or not"? You may know it and you ought to know it. If you
   believe, you are saved! If you doubt that fact, you are rather an
   unbeliever than a Believer. Take up your money and go home. "O you of
   little faith, why did you doubt?" Trust Jesus! Your faith has saved
   you. Go in peace.

   The Lord help you truly to believe, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Romans 8:15-39.

A Private Enquiry

   (No. 2184)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 18, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   9, 1890.

   "What is the thing that the Lord has said unto you?" 1 Samuel 3:17.

   THE Lord would not speak directly to Eli, although he was the High
   Priest. In ordinary circumstances it would have been so, but Eli had
   grieved the Lord, and thus had lost his honorable standing. God had not
   cast him off, but He viewed him with such displeasure that He would
   only speak to him through another person--even as great kings, if they
   are offended with their courtiers--send them messages by other hands.
   The Lord sent, first, a man of God to warn Eli of what would be the
   sure result of his lack of firmness with his sons. And when He gave him
   a second warning, it was sent through one who was a little underling in
   his family.

   O you saints who live upon familiar terms with the Lord, take heed of
   sin, lest you lose your close communion, your favored fellowship and
   stand in a second place! God will speak to you, but it will be in
   warning and in a roundabout way--not face to face, with His lips to
   your ear, as He has been known to do while you have pleased Him. God
   will not cast you off, but He may set you aside for a time. You may
   still hear His message through others, but He will be silent to you,
   personally. You may have to live in the frigid zone of doubt and
   anxiety, instead of sunning yourselves in the full blaze of Divine
   Love. It was so with Eli--he had forborne to rebuke sin in his own
   house--and had brought the anger of God upon himself! And, therefore,
   he had no comfortable union and no honor with Jehovah, but must be
   schooled by a

   child.

   Further, when God had sent a man of God to Eli and the message did not
   awaken him to a sense of his sin in overindulgence of his sons and
   toleration of evil in those under him, the Lord sends him a threatening
   word by a child, for God has many messengers. The sending of the child,
   Samuel, to bear the terrible tidings to the aged priest was a sweet but
   stern rebuke of Eli. The child is awake, while the old man is locked in
   the slumber which comes of a seared conscience. Experience must now be
   admonished by childhood and wisdom by simplicity! Gray hairs, in this
   case, yield not a crown of glory to the erring ruler, but he must bow
   his head in sorrow at a rebuke brought to him by a lowly boy. The child
   is evidently more trusted by God than the venerable priest! It was the
   beginning of the Divine chastisement that his honor should pass away
   and an aged priest should stand reproved by a youthful Prophet. There
   was much mercy in it, yet we clearly see the Lord stripping His servant
   of his decorations and setting him in a lower place--making the Urim
   and the Thummim which he wore upon his breast to be of secondary power
   for showing the future, while the Spirit rested more fully on a holy
   boy.

   He, whose talk was still that of childhood, becomes a mouth for God,
   while the venerable ruler of his people has nothing to say but to
   submit to his inevitable punishment! Eli was a man of God and,
   notwithstanding his great chastisement and his mournful death, I doubt
   not that he died in the Lord. But he brought dishonor on his own name
   and he was condemned to know that his holy office would not be
   continued in his line--that none of his descendants should live to old
   age. He had not duly honored the Lord and, therefore, he heard the
   sentence pronounced on him and on his race. "They that honor Me, I will
   honor, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed." He had
   spared the rod of rebuke and, therefore, the axe ofjudgment fell on his
   house, "because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them
   not." O Brothers and Sisters, let us beware of sin--of allowing sin in
   those under our charge--lest the Lord lay us low and send an affliction
   upon us, which shall cleave to our race forever!

   We will now use Eli's question, by which he extracted from Samuel the
   message of God, and we will view it in three lights. First, as put to
   Samuel. Secondly, as coming from Eli. And, thirdly, as capable of being
   turned upon ourselves. We will ask it of ourselves, as another might
   ask it. And we will answer it to our own hearts, so that we may, by a
   rehearsal, become ready to give an answer to him that shall ask us in
   days to come. Come, my heart, answer to yourself, "What is the thing
   that the Lord has said to you?" May the Holy Spirit help you by
   bringing all things to your remembrance, whatever He has said to you!

   I. First, let us view this question as addressed TO SAMUEL.

   The first remark which we shall make upon it is that God does speak to
   men. Otherwise this would be a senseless ques-tion--"What is the thing
   that the Lord has said unto you?" God does communicate with mortals. He
   is not shut up all alone by Himself in sublime solitude. He has not
   placed His creatures at an immeasurable distance, with an impassable
   abyss between their littleness and His own grandeur. It is not true
   that He cannot hear their cries, nor respond to them in tones of love.
   In ways suitable to their feeble nature, the Lord has spoken to men.

   He has done so in the Inspired volume of His sacred Word. Every line in
   this priceless volume was dictated by the Spirit and is a message from
   God to men. This Book is to be read as the record of Jehovah's voice.
   It is the phonograph of our Father's speech in days gone by. What He
   has spoken aforetime by His voice, He continues to speak to us by His
   written Word. He spoke through Prophets and Seers, Evangelists and
   Apostles--and here we have it--even all that is of abiding significance
   to us upon whom the ends of the world are come.

   God, in a renewed manner, speaks to us by His Word when His Spirit
   applies it to us individually. We never truly hear the voice of God in
   Scripture until the Truth of God is spoken home to each heart and
   conscience by the Holy Spirit. Revelation must be revealed to each one,
   otherwise it soon comes to be a veiling of the Truth, rather than a
   discovering of the Lord's mind. The Revelation is clear enough in
   itself, but we have not the opened eyes till Divine Grace bestows it.
   If we have not the Spirit of God, the letter may actually become a veil
   to hide the spirit of Truth. This, indeed, it should not be, neither is
   it according to its natural intent and tendency--but our depravity
   makes it so, turning even the Light of God, itself, into a thing which
   blinds. Do you know what it is to have a text leap out of the
   Scriptures upon you and carry you away? This special energy and flash
   of Truth is always memorable. How often have the waves of this sea of
   Truth been phosphorescent before my eyes--a sea of glass mingled with
   fire--of which the spray has dashed over me and set my soul on fire! As
   surely as the Lord spoke these words to Moses, or to David, or to
   Isaiah, or to John, or to Paul, so surely does He speak them to our
   souls by His Spirit. Do you understand what I say?

   Moreover, our God has ways of communicating His mind to His children by
   those of His servants who speak in His name. He directs the thoughts of
   His ministers and suggests their words so that they speak to the cases
   of those who are led to hear the Word of God.

   By our own thoughts, also, the Lord communes with us. If we will be
   still before Him, He will prepare our hearts and in silence we shall
   hear His voice. It would be a strange thing if God could not and did
   not communicate with His own children. And it is still more strange and
   sad that, though He does speak, His people are slow of heart and dull
   of hearing.

   Our God also speaks to us in Providence. In choice favors we hear His
   soft and tender tones. In chastisement and rebukes we hear the sterner
   notes. But every sound is full of love. The Lord has ways of taking His
   children apart and speaking to them upon their beds. In the wilderness
   He speaks to the heart. He can talk with us in Nature. Have you not
   heard Him in the thunder? In the roaring of the sea? Yes, we hear Him,
   not only in the dash of Niagara, but in the ripple of the brook and the
   smiling of a primrose on its bank! The Lord is never voiceless except
   to the earless soul. He speaks-- let us hear.

   Here we make a further remark--God regards not age in His speaking, but
   He condescends to speak with young children. Samuel was the Lord's in
   his long clothes and served the Lord while a boy--and the Lord did not
   disdain to come to his little cot at night and call him by his name. We
   often talk as if it could not be possible that the Lord should speak
   with boys and girls and yet, my Brothers and Sisters, there is not much
   more of a stoop in God's talking with a child than in His speaking to a
   man! Indeed, the man has more of sin and thus he is often farther off
   from God than the child. If the children here present are, by God's
   Grace, made willing to hear God's voice--if they are obedient to the
   Lord and have open hearts and attentive minds towards His Word--the
   great God will not pass them by! The Lord stoops to the lowli-

   ness of a child and smiles at its simplicity. If young people are
   prayerful, thoughtful, reverent, believing and obedient, the fact that,
   like Samuel, they are small in stature and young in years, shall be no
   detriment to them! The Lord will speak and call them by their names.

   My observation leads me to believe that many children have heard more
   of God than persons who are grown up. They may not find willing ears to
   hear what the Lord has said to them, but if they did, they could tell
   us marvelous things. Some of us remember how, in our own childhood, the
   Lord dealt wonderfully with us and there were "prophecies which went
   before" concerning us, whose meaning we can now read, though at the
   time we did not understand them. I think that young Samuel was one of
   the fittest persons in the world for the Lord to choose as His
   messenger. And so far from its being unusual for young ears to hear the
   voice from Heaven, I think they are the best prepared to do so. Four
   times the Lord said, "Samuel, Samuel," and the child responded and said
   at last, when he knew who it was that called him, "Speak, Lord, for
   Your servant hears." Anyone here who can say from his heart, "Speak,
   Lord, for Your servant hears," will not be long without a word from the
   Invisible! Oh, that our ears may be opened to heavenly tidings--may be
   wakened, morning by morning, by the voice of the Lord! May we often
   hear it as the morning song and the evening hymn! May the Lord also
   hear our voices in prayer and praise and meditation till our lives
   shall be a holy dialog between our souls and our God, never dying down
   into silence, but lasting on until we behold Him face to face!

   Our next observation is that when we do hear the voice of God we should
   be deeply impressed by it. Young Samuel gave evidence that he deeply
   felt the responsibility of having heard the voice of God. We read that,
   "Samuel lay till morn-ing"--he did not go to sleep, but he did not
   leave his bed. He laid still and thought. After hearing that terrible
   word which made his heart heavy and caused his ears to tingle, like a
   wise child, he lay still and pondered it in his soul. He did not rush
   in upon Eli, for the news was hard to tell. Neither did he seek out
   another confidant. He had been called to be the Lord's Prophet. He was
   conscious of his commission and he became sober beyond his years. "He
   lay till morning." What thoughts passed through his mind on his bed! He
   had been a child when he went to rest last night and now he had
   suddenly become a man with a dread secret entrusted to him!

   A pressing anxiety was on him as to how he should speak to Eli--and a
   battle raged within his heart between a fear of grieving the good old
   man by the message--and the greater fear of grieving God by keeping any
   of it back. He remained still upon his bed, quietly meditating and
   turning over what he had heard, and thinking of what he should do. I
   would to God that, after every sermon, all my hearers, young and old,
   had a quarter of an hour alone! A night of wakeful thought over it
   would be still better. I am sure that what is needed with our religious
   reading is time for private thought. We put into the mill more than it
   grinds! Some people imagine that if they read so many chapters of the
   Bible every day, it will be much to their profit--but it is not so if
   the reading is a mere mechanical exercise. It will be far better to
   read a tenth as much and weigh it--and let it take possession of brain
   and heart. A little food cooked is better for dinner than a great joint
   raw. A man who wants to see a country must not hurry through it by
   express train, but he must stop in the towns and villages and see what
   is to be seen. He will know more about the land and its people if he
   walks the highways, climbs the mountains, stays in the homes and visits
   the workshops, than if he does so many miles in the day and hurries
   through picture galleries as if death were pursuing him. Don't hurry
   through Scripture, but pause for the Lord to speak to you. Oh, for more
   meditation! Samuel, "lay till morning." Wise child that! With such work
   before him for his head and his heart, he did well to lie quiet, take a
   breath and collect his strength.

   Next, the heavenly voice made such an impression on his mind that he
   feared to tell it to Eli. The message was so dreadful to him that he
   dreaded to repeat it to him whom it most concerned. When you and I know
   God's Word and hear God's voice in it, it will often strike us with a
   solemn awe which will quite overpower us. Jacob, when he saw the ladder
   and the angels, did not say in the morning, "How delightful was the
   vision! How happy was my dream!" That would have been like the language
   of shallow, superficial minds. But he said, "How dreadful is this
   place! This is none other but the House of God and this is the gate of
   Heaven." I know that God's Revelation of Himself to us is calculated to
   fill us with intense joy, but it is even more likely to cast us down
   upon our faces, prostrate before His Divine Majesty, in solemn awe of
   the Lord of Hosts. Remember how John put it. "When I saw Him, I fell at
   His feet as dead." He was the best beloved of the Lord and yet, at the
   sight of our glorious Well-Beloved, he had no life left in him, but he
   swooned at His feet! Marvel not that "the child Samuel feared"--and
   especially feared to tell Eli the vision. I say that when you and I
   hear the voice of the Lord our God, it will create in us deep emotions
   of fear, of joy and of holy reverence--and we shall

   know of a surety that it is no little thing to hear the Word of the
   Most High. We shall tremble at His Word, yet we shall rejoice to hear
   it!

   I would say, next, that we should store up in our memories whatever God
   says to us. These are not things which we can safely allow to slip.
   What is written in this Book should be transferred to our memories. It
   is a good thing to learn passages of Scripture by heart, even as
   classical scholars treasure up the words of their favorite authors. It
   is a good thing to have texts of Scripture used from day to day to
   sweeten the breath and then laid by in the heart to perfume the
   character. A mind well stored with Biblical lore will be a great cheer
   to us, should we live, like Eli, till our eyes are dim and we cannot
   see to read. The Bible in the memory is better than the Bible in the
   bookcase. All that this child heard from the Lord, he kept in his
   memory, so that, when the time came, he could produce it, "every whit."
   And in later days could write it down in this, his history. Oh, that
   you and I were able to produce "every whit" of what God has spoken to
   us! Alas, too often the Word has come and it has gone--and it has left
   small trace behind. We have heard and we have forgotten. God grant
   that, after this, whenever we hear what God, the Lord, shall speak, we
   may mark, learn and inwardly digest the same! And then it will not
   depart from us, but will remain for our growth, strength and building
   up.

   One more remark. Looking at the text in its light toward Samuel, we
   learn that we should be able to tell what we hear from God. We find Eli
   saying to Samuel, "What is the thing that the Lord has said unto you?"
   If God has spoken to us, somebody or other will need to know and will
   have a right to be informed. It may be that many whom we esteem will
   wish to know what God has spoken to us--so we must be prepared--even
   though it is with a measure of fear and trembling, to tell them the
   solemn tidings. What is whispered in our ears in the closet we may have
   to speak on the housetops.

   Samuel did this very solemnly, with a deep sense of its weight.
   Children are generally eager to tell a story, but they do not always
   consider what effect its repetition may produce. They are not able to
   keep a secret, but feel a pleasure in communicating what they know. But
   this child was now raised up by the Spirit of prophecy and became
   tender and thoughtful. And as it would cause Eli great anguish, he was
   very slow to speak. He did not open his mouth on the matter till he was
   commanded by Eli, and then he did it as a sacred duty. Young Christians
   should speak much of their Lord and His Gospel. God forbid that I
   should hinder them! But it will be well for them to speak, not because
   it is pleasant, but because they must. We must tell out the Divine Word
   because there is a woe upon us if we withhold it. We must not be
   flippant, but solemnly, under constraint. Much zeal is very natural,
   but very worthless, because its source is not Divine. That zeal which
   is kindled and sustained by a heavenly power which makes us feel that
   we must speak or the very stones would cry out against us--this zeal, I
   say, is of an effectual kind--and the more of it the better! If I only
   feel that I may, or may not, tell what I think I have heard from the
   Lord, the probability is that I had better be silent. The true
   prophetic Word is as fire in the bones--it must come out--and yet when
   it is spoken it is with lips which a live altar-coal has blistered.

   Samuel did his work very carefully and completely. We read, "and Samuel
   told him every whit, and hid nothing from him." He said nothing more
   and nothing less than God had spoken. You know how difficult it is to
   repeat a story correctly. You may try it at your own table, with all
   the good people around it. Whisper a story into the ear of the next
   person to you and let it be repeated in the same fashion from one to
   another and, by the time it comes round the small circle, it will be
   quite a fresh affair! Additions and subtractions are weeds which are
   hard to keep out of the garden of conversation! Alas, this holds good
   even of the Word of the Lord--how many add to it or take from it! But
   the child Samuel repeated his story correctly because the fear of the
   Lord was upon him. When you do tell the Gospel, tell it correctly, for
   it is wonderfully easy to make another gospel of it--and the tendency
   to do so is very powerful in these days. How many are proclaiming a
   mutilated gospel and are not telling "every whit!" Some part of
   Revelation they think too high, or too dry or too orthodox, or too
   something or other--and so their overweening conceit induces them to
   leave it out. Oh, do not so, I pray you!

   Samuel is to be commended that, when he had to tell Eli what God had
   spoken, he left out nothing. Tell out the Gospel, you ministers of
   Christ! Give Christ His due! Give fair proportion to each Truth of God.
   Do not magnify one doctrine to the exclusion of another, but endeavor
   to paint the portrait of Revelation with every feature in its place and
   in due proportion to the rest. It is great wisdom to be able to repeat
   fully and faithfully what God has spoken to us. May the Holy Spirit aid
   us herein!

   It was a very painful duty which the holy child was called upon to
   perform. Samuel loved his foster father and for him to mention the
   tremendous doom pronounced upon Eli's house must have caused him great
   grief of spirit. But he bravely

   repeated the dread words of the Most High. There are certain Truths in
   God's Word which we tremble to think upon. Do you dream that we have
   any pleasure in the doctrine of eternal punishment? We speak of the
   wrath to come and the everlasting punishment which God apportions to
   the impenitent with fear and trembling, but we speak of it because we
   cannot escape from the conviction that it is taught in the Word of God!
   As Samuel was compelled to tell Eli of the unalterable curse that God
   had pronounced upon his household, so must God's faithful servants, in
   the discharge of their duty, speak of the doom of the wicked and never
   flinch from warning them. O my Hearers, "he that believes not shall be
   damned," is as true as, "he that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." We must speak all the Gospel or else the blood of souls will
   stain our skirts at the Last Great Day. However painful a duty it may
   be, it is none the less binding upon us!

   But then, in Samuel's case, it was an obvious duty. It must have been
   clear to the young Prophet that he must tell Eli what so much concerned
   him. This conclusion would be reached without much reasoning. If God
   had spoken to Samuel, it could only be that he might tell Eli. My
   Hearer, if the Lord has told you anything about eternal things, He has
   revealed it that you may pass it on. The Truth of God is no man's
   private property, to be kept under lock and key, as a secret hoard for
   personal enrichment. Whatever you know about Christ, tell it! Whatever
   you know about salvation and Sovereign Grace, tell it! It is revealed
   to you that you may bear it aloft like a flaming torch for the
   enlightening of others! God will not speak again to the man who does
   not spread His Truth. Samuel perceived his duty clearly.

   And, dear Friends, to communicate the message of God was a very weighty
   duty to the child Samuel. Read what Eli said to him. "I pray you, hide
   it not from me: God do so to you, and more, also, if you hide anything
   from me of all the things that He said unto you." My Brother in the
   Gospel, what if you and I should keep back some painful part of God's
   message and God should do so to us, and more, also? I cannot bear to be
   lost and yet I shall be lost if I decline to warn others of their
   danger and of the doom of unbelief! I cannot bear to be cast away
   forever from the Presence of God, yet this woe will be unto me if I
   preach not the Gospel and do not declare the whole counsel of God! The
   result of unbelief and sin in others will fall on us if we do not warn
   them! O Sirs, if we are unfaithful, God will deal with us at the Day of
   Judgment as He will deal with the wicked--this is an awful outlook for
   us! May we never dare to tone down the more severe parts of the Gospel
   and flatter men in their sins, for if we do this, God will mete out to
   us a portion with the condemned! If we have sown pillows for their
   armholes and rocked their cradles by our smooth speech, their eternal
   ruin shall lie at our door! How shall we bear it when God shall "do so
   to us, and more, also," because we kept back His message from the sons
   of men who so much needed it? Let us resolve that come what will, we
   will keep back nothing of the Truth of God which the Lord has entrusted
   to us. A false witness for God, a liar to men's souls--what sentence
   can be greater than his deserts? Is it possible for us to be too
   earnest here?

   I have said enough upon the text in its first light. I pray for
   practical result from it. The Lord does speak to men and it behooves
   them to hear with reverence--and make known His Word with solemn
   fidelity and earnestness.

   II. Let us now view the question as it comes FROM ELI.

   I understand from Eli's question, first, that we should willingly
   learn, even from a child. "What? Shall I, a man of 70 or 80, learn from
   a child?" asks one. Yes, unless you are more foolish than Eli, you may
   do so. Eli, with all his faults, was willing to hear what God might
   speak, even if he heard it from the lips of the child, Samuel. How
   unwise people are when they will not hear a man, but make up their mind
   that he knows nothing! Some would not hear the most precious Truth of
   God from the lips of a man whom they despise. Certain of the friars in
   Luther's day confessed that much of what Luther said was very true and
   a reformation was certainly very much needed, but then, they would not
   have it from such a fellow as Luther--a renegade monk who spoke so
   rudely! Erasmus could be endured, but Luther made such a noise about
   it!

   Teaching is often judged, not by its own value, but by the prejudices
   which people may happen to have concerning the source from which it
   comes. "I do not like him," says one. Well, what does it matter whether
   you like him or not? What does he say? If a thing is true, never mind
   who says it. Believe it! If a babe could be put into the pulpit and it
   lisped out the precious Gospel of Christ, its lisping would be more
   worth hearing than all the eloquence of men of years and name whose
   objective might be to overthrow men's faith. Let the Truth of God come
   from where it may, welcome it! If God has spoken, though it be but to a
   boy in knickerbockers, be ready to ask him, "What is the thing that the
   Lord has said to you?"

   Next, learn from Eli that we should be willing to know the very worst
   of our case. Let me repeat that word--we should be willing to know the
   very worst of our case. I have used this expression in my own prayers
   many a time--"Lord, let me know the worst of my case." I suggest it as
   a very excellent petition. Surely, we do not wish to be left in a
   fool's paradise, pleased with the idea that we are rich and increased
   in goods and have need of nothing--when all the while we are naked,
   poor and miserable. We desire to be informed as to our condition. We
   would know even the frightful truth, the humbling truth, what some
   would even call the degrading truth--if, indeed, it is truth. We wish
   to be degraded, if to know the truth would make us feel degraded.
   Better in the abyss of a truth than on the summit of a lie! We wish to
   be, in our own sight, what we are in the sight of God. We would not be
   shams, hypocrites, veneered pretenders, but we would be good men and
   true.

   Dear Friend, for this reason do not be angry with the minister if, when
   you go to hear him on the Lord's Day, his text is not a promise, or a
   sweet bit of doctrine, but a warning and an exhortation, or even a
   condemnation. Bare your back to the whip and take your share of the
   lashes. If the Lord's servant has nothing to give but what comes from
   the bitter box, do not make faces over it. If he is the Lord's steward
   and deals out God's Truth, quarrel not with him, lest you be found
   contending with your Maker! Take the portion, or I might say the
   potion--it may be the very thing you need. If God has sent you a bitter
   potion, it will be better for you than the sweetest dainties a
   smooth-tongued flatterer could prepare. Cry to God to search you and to
   make you to know your true condition as before His face.

   Next, we should desire to hear the whole of God's Word. We should say
   to our minister, "I pray you hide it not from me. What is the thing
   that the Lord has said to you?" Oh, that our Hearers would desire this
   at our hands! Ask us, yes, plead with us to tell you all that we know
   of the Truth of God--and when you have heard all that we know of the
   Truth--search the Scriptures and find out more, that you may be well
   instructed in the things which make for your peace. Be like Eli--afraid
   to have anything kept from you--and anxious to have full information.
   Like Eli, we should demand faithfulness. We should say to the teacher,
   to the friend who is dealing with our soul, "I pray you hide it not
   from me; but be faithful to me." You do not go to a surgeon that he may
   falsely assure you that you have no wound. And I hope you do not come
   here that I may give you unsafe comfort and make you feel content in
   sin. No, Beloved, if you come aright, you say, "I go to hear the Word
   of God as I go to a physician, that I may have my case truthfully
   described and honestly treated by one who takes his Master's medicines
   out of his Master's treasures." Hear not that which makes you contented
   with self, but that which leads you to seek higher and better things.
   Let those who are foolish desire to be lulled into the deadly slumber
   of delusion, but for yourselves, seek after the Truth of God, the whole
   Truth of God and nothing but the Truth of God--and love that which
   humbles you and draws you nearer to your Lord!

   Dear Hearers, pray for us who are preachers of the Gospel, that we may
   be made faithful and kept so! You know the prevailing currents of these
   times are toward flesh-pleasing teaching. Men aspire to be clever and,
   to that end, they must appear to be bold thinkers, highly cultured and
   far removed from the old worn-out notions of orthodoxy. Many are the
   floral displays in sermons! Sheaves of corn are too plain and rustic.
   This is the age of bouquets and wreaths of rare flowers. Paul must give
   way to Browning and David to Tennyson. Brothers, there are enough in
   the novelty business without us--we have something better to do! We
   have to give an account unto our God of what we do and say. And if we
   have been murderers of souls, it will be no excuse that we flourished
   the dagger well, or that, when we gave them poison, we mixed the
   draught cleverly and presented it with poetical phrases. Pray for us
   that we may be clear of the blood of all men. Keep us right by saying
   to us, "What is the thing the Lord has said to you? I pray you, hide it
   not from me!"

   III. And now, we conclude by considering the question TO AND FROM
   OURSELVES. I want to put a series of questions very briefly and with
   great solemnity.

   Have we ever asked the Lord to speak to us? Yes, yes, my Sister, I know
   you have! And you, my Brother, you have done still more, for God has
   already spoken to you. But here, on Thursday evenings, are many
   unconverted people and I am much rejoiced that you care to come on a
   week-night to such a place as this. I do not attribute your presence,
   in every case, to the highest motive, for you come to hear a preacher
   of whom you have heard much talk. And at another time you will go to
   hear some noted orator in another place. Did you ever say to yourself,
   "I will hear what God the Lord will speak"? This would be a far better
   objective than listening to human rhetoric. Have you shut yourself up
   in your room, or have you gone into the woods, or climbed a hilltop, or
   sat down by the sea and said, "Speak to me, Lord! If there are voices
   out of the eternal and the unseen, here am I to hear them. In mercy
   speak to me"? My dear Hearer, are you God's

   creature and have you never heard the voice of your Creator? Do you
   think yourself God's child and do you live by the month together and
   never hear your Father's voice? This is pitiable--alas, it is
   blameworthy! I press the question home. Have you ever asked the Lord to
   speak to you?

   Next, have we all regarded what God has spoken? When we were young, on
   a Sabbath we heard a word from the pulpit which seemed to go right
   through us--and then and there we wished that we could go home to our
   chamber to pray. And when we got home, we shut our door and we cried
   out in our anxiety because all was not right between God and our souls.
   But what came of it? The tears we shed--were they the tokens of coming
   conversion? Is it not sadly true that Monday found us at our old
   tricks? We had forgotten what manner of men we were! Was it not so? Is
   it so still with some of you? Has God spoken and spoken, and spoken,
   and spoken, again, and do you still act like the adder that will not
   hear, though the charmer charms most wisely? Are you as the ass and as
   the mule which have no understanding and need bit and bridle before you
   will obey your Master? The Lord have mercy upon you if it is so! If you
   have been brutish and obstinate, may Divine Grace subdue you.

   A further question is this--Have we shaped our lives by what God has
   said? I know many people who read their Bibles and know what the
   Scripture means, but they never practice what God says to them. Among
   the rest, they neglect that great Gospel promise--"He that believes and
   is baptized shall be saved." They have neither believed nor been
   baptized. They are bid to do this and that as Believers--and, avowing
   themselves to be Believers, they yet refuse to their Lord the obedience
   which He claims! O my Hearers, to know the Word of God and not to put
   it into practice is to make rods for your own backs, for he that knew
   his Master's will and did it not was beaten with many stripes. The more
   you know, the more stripes will come upon you if you have only
   knowledge and not obedience! Does not this truthful word come home to
   some who are sitting here at this time? It ought to do so! God grant
   that it may lead the "hearers only" to become "doers of the word"!

   Next, Brothers and Sisters, have we told what we know? That is a
   practical point. I speak to quite a number of Christian men and women
   who would have to confess, "No. I am like Samuel, so far that I fear to
   tell Eli the vision." You were going to speak to the person who sat in
   the pew with you the other Sunday and you almost got a word out, but it
   died on your lips. For idle words you will have to give an account. You
   meant to pray with your child, Mother, but you have not done it yet.
   What if she dies before you have done so? Good Friend, you meant to
   speak to the man at the next bench in your workshop. Ah, you have meant
   to do it so many times! I had a friend, a dear friend, who is now, I
   trust, in Heaven, and there was a man who used to take orders from him
   for goods and bring them to him when finished. He was a good and
   punctual workman, but not a Christian. Well, my friend intended--ah, he
   intended for years--to have a quiet conversation with that workman
   about his soul.

   One day the goods came in, but a woman brought them. She said, "I am
   So-and-So's wife. He finished these goods, but he is dead." My friend
   said that the words were like a bullet to his heart, for he had so
   often thought of the man and often said to himself, "I must and will
   speak to him the next time he calls." But somehow, when he came into
   the shop, business was brisk and he looked over the goods and paid for
   them as quickly as he could--and never began a conversation! Now the
   man was beyond the reach of warning or instruction. Do not let it be so
   with any person with whom you come in contact! Do as Samuel did--tell
   the whole of it if they ask you to tell them--or even if they do not
   ask you to tell them! Those who do not ask you are probably those who
   have the most need of your efforts! I believe there is an art in
   private conversation. Certain of our dear friends are always telling
   out the Gospel on all sides and they seem to do it with much ease. I
   speak of my Lord, also, to individuals, but I must confess that it does
   not come so easy to me to speak to an individual as to preach to
   thousands. We must school ourselves to it. That art of buttonholing and
   coming into close contact with individuals is one that we must
   cultivate--and we must not be satisfied until we become expert in
   it--for it is one of the chief ways in which men are saved.

   Lastly, there is one question which I would like to ask and I have
   done. Do our children ever rebuke us? Perhaps we have no children--they
   are all grown up, but possibly we have grandchildren. This Samuel was
   to Eli like a grandchild. His sons were grown up and had left him. But
   here was this little one brought into the Temple to minister there and
   the old man came to be rebuked by this little child! I have known
   some--perhaps they are even now present--who are godless fathers,
   drunken fathers, but their grandchildren are members of the Church and
   good, gracious, amiable, lovely, useful children, too! Grandfathers,
   are you going down to Hell while your grandchildren are going to
   Heaven? I charge

   you by the living God, before whose bar you must surely stand, look at
   your little ones and hear their prayers and hear their hymns--could you
   bear to be everlastingly separated from them? And, Fathers, this should
   come home closely to you. You know that girl of yours--how you love
   her--and well you may! Your heart is bound up in your little daughter.
   She is everything a child can be to a father--but she often weeps
   because she tries to get you to hear the Gospel and you will not come.
   Sunday to you is not what it is to her and that grieves her.

   You were making a rabbit hutch last Sunday, were you not? And your
   child said, "Father, do come to the House of God," but you would not
   come, and you pained your child. Will you bear in mind a solemn Truth
   of God? If your daughter goes to the right and you go to the left, you
   are probably parting forever. It is not possible that the way of sin
   should end where the way of righteousness will end! Do not choose
   eternal separation from your dear ones who love the Lord. Think these
   things over because, on a Sabbath, when we celebrate the Lord's Supper,
   some of you have to go away and leave a wife or a dear child behind to
   commune at the sacred feast. Many thoughts are stirred at that dividing
   time. I wish that such searching of heart might arise tonight in
   downright earnest. There will be weeping--there will be weeping, at the
   Judgement Seat of Christ! And if children now rebuke their Christless
   friends, what will be the thunder of that rebuke when they shall be
   caught up to the Throne of the highest and their ungodly relatives are
   cast out forever into the pit prepared for the wicked? God bless you
   all richly, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

Our Manifesto

   (No. 2185)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 25, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT AN ASSEMBLY OF MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL.

   DELIVERED ON FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL 25, 1890.

   "But I make known to you, Brethren, that the Gospel which was preached
   of me is not after man."

   Galatians 1:11.

   To me it is a pitiful sight to see Paul defending himself as an Apostle
   and, doing this, not against the gainsaying world, but against
   cold-hearted members of the Church! They said that he was not truly an
   Apostle, for he had not seen the Lord. And they uttered a great many
   other things derogatory to him. To maintain his claim to the
   Apostleship, he was driven to commence his Epistles with, "Paul, an
   Apostle of Jesus Christ," though his work was a self-evident proof of
   his call. If, after God has blessed us to the conversion of many, some
   of these should raise a question as to our call to the ministry, we may
   count it a fiery trial--but we shall not conclude that a strange thing
   has happened to us. There is much more room to question our call to the
   ministry than to cast a doubt upon Paul's Apostleship! This indignity,
   if it is put upon us, we can, by His Grace, cheerfully bear for our
   Master's sake. We need not wonder, dear Brothers, if our ministry
   should be the subject of attack, because this has been the lot of those
   who have gone before us--and we should lack one great seal of our
   acceptance with God if we did not receive the unconscious homage of
   enmity which is always paid to the faithful by the ungodly world! When
   the devil is not troubled by us, he does not trouble us. If his kingdom
   is not shaken, he will not care about us or our work, but will let us
   enjoy inglorious ease. Be comforted by the experience of the Apostle of
   the Gentiles--he is peculiarly our Apostle--and we may regard his
   experience as a type of what we may expect while we labor among the
   Gentiles of our own day.

   The treatment which has been given to eminent men while they have lived
   has been prophetic of the treatment of their reputations after death.
   This evil world is unchangeable in antagonism to true principles,
   whether their advocates are dead or living. They said, more than 1,800
   years ago--"Paul, what of him?" They still say so. It is not unusual to
   hear dubious persons profess to differ from the Apostle and they even
   dare to say, "There, I do not agree with Paul." I remember the first
   time that I heard this expression. I looked at the individual with
   astonishment. I was amazed that such a pigmy as he should say this of
   the great Apostle! Altogether apart from Paul's Inspiration, it seemed
   like a cheese-mite differing from a cherub, or a handful of chaff
   discussing the verdict of the fire! The individual was so utterly
   beneath observation that I could not but marvel that his conceit should
   have been so outspokenly shameless. Notwithstanding this objection,
   even when supported by learned critics, we still agree with the
   Inspired servant of God. It is our firm conviction that to differ from
   Paul's Epistles is to differ from the Holy Spirit--and to differ from
   the Lord Jesus Christ, whose mind Paul has fully expressed! It is
   remarkable that Paul's writings should be so assailed! But this warns
   us that when we have gone to our reward, our names will not be free
   from aspersion, nor our teaching from opposition. The noblest of the
   departed are still slandered. Be not careful as to human judgment of
   yourself in death or in life, for what does it matter? Your real
   character, no man can injure but yourself, and if you are enabled to
   keep your garments clean, all else is not worth a thought.

   To come more closely to our text. We do not claim to be able to use
   Paul's words exactly in the full sense which he could throw into them,
   but there is a sense in which, I trust, we can each one say, "I make
   known to you, Brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me is not
   after man." We may not only say this, but we ought to be able to say it
   with thorough truthfulness. The form of expression goes as far as Paul
   was known to go towards an oath when he says, "I

   make known to you, brethren." He means, I assure you most certainly--I
   would have you to be certain of it--"that the Gospel which was preached
   of me is not after man." On this point he would have all the brethren
   know past all doubt.

   From the context we are sure that he meant, first of all, that his
   Gospel was not received by him from men. His reception of it, in his
   own mind, was not after men. And next, he meant, that the Gospel itself
   was not invented by men. If I can hammer out these two statements, we
   will then draw practical conclusions from them.

   I. First, TO US THE GOSPEL IS NOT AFTER MEN AS TO THE MODE BY WHICH WE
   HAVE RECEIVED IT. In a certain sense we received it from men as to the
   outward part of the reception, for we were called by the Grace of God
   through parental influence, or through a Sunday school teacher, or by
   the ministry of the Word, or by the reading of a godly book, or by
   other agency. But in Paul's case, none of these things were used! He
   was distinctly called by the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, speaking to
   him from Heaven and revealing Himself in His own light. It was
   necessary that Paul should not be indebted to Peter, or James, or
   John--even in the way in which many of us are indebted to
   instrumentality--so that he might truly say, "I neither received it of
   man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ."
   Yet we also can say this in another sense. We, also, have received the
   Gospel in a way beyond the power of man to convey it to us--men brought
   it to our ears, but the Lord, Himself, applied it to our heart. The
   best of the saints could not have brought it home to our hearts, so as
   to regenerate, convert and sanctify us by it. There was a distinct act
   of God, the Holy Spirit, by which the instrumentality was made
   effectual and the truth was rendered operative upon our souls.

   So I note that not one among us has received the Gospel by birthright.
   We may be the children of holy parents, but we are not, therefore, the
   children of God. To us it is clear that, "that which is born of the
   flesh is flesh," and nothing more. Only, "that which is born of the
   Spirit is spirit." Yet we hear of persons whose children do not need
   conversion. They are spoken of as being free from natural corruption
   and born children of God--having a Divine Grace within which only needs
   to be developed. I am sorry to say that my father did not find me such
   a child. He found out early in my life that I was born in sin, shaped
   in iniquity and that folly was bound up in my heart! Friends and
   teachers soon perceived in me a natural depravity and, assuredly, I
   have found it in myself! The sad discovery needed no minute research,
   for the effect of the evil stared me in the face in my character.

   This tradition as to our being born with a holy nature is gaining
   foothold in the professing church, though contrary to Scripture--and
   even to the confessions of faith which are still avowedly maintained!
   Certain preachers hardly dare formulate it as a doctrine, but it is,
   with them, a kind of chaotic belief that there may be productions of
   the flesh which are very superior and will serve well enough without
   the new birth of the Spirit. This tacit belief will lead up to
   birthright membership and that is fatal to any Christian community,
   wherever it comes to be the rule! Without conversion, in certain
   fellowships, young people may drift into the church as a matter of
   course, but the church becomes only a part of the world--with the
   Christian name affixed to it!

   May we never, in our Churches, sink into that condition! That religion
   which is a mere family appendage is of little worth! The true seed are
   "born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
   man, but of God." We have not received our faith by tradition from our
   parents--and yet, some of us, if true faith could be so received, would
   certainly have thus received it, for if we are not Hebrews of the
   Hebrews, but, according to our family tree, we are Puritans of the
   Puritans, descended throughout many generations of Believers. Of this
   we make small account before God, though we are not ashamed of it
   before men. We have no father in our spiritual life but the Lord,
   Himself, and we have not received that life, or the Gospel, by any
   carnal parentage, but of the Lord alone!

   Brothers, we have not received the Gospel, nor do we now receive it,
   because of the teaching of any man, or set of men. Do you receive
   anything because Calvin taught it? If so, you had need look to your
   foundations. Do you believe a doctrine because John Wesley preached it?
   If so, you have reason to mind what you are doing. God's way, by which
   we are to receive the Truth of God, is to receive it by the Holy
   Spirit! It is helpful to me to know what such-and-such a minister
   believed. The judgment of a holy, godly, clear-sighted, gifted Divine
   is not to be despised--it deserves to have due weight with us. He is as
   likely to be right as we are and we should differ from a Grace-taught
   man with some hesitancy. But it is a very different thing to say, "I
   believe it on this good man's authority."

   In our raw state as young Christians, it may not be injurious to
   receive the Truth of God from pastors and parents, and so on, but if we
   are to become men in Christ Jesus, and teachers of others, we must quit
   the childish habit of depend-

   ence on others and search for ourselves! We may now leave the egg and
   get rid of the pieces of shell as quickly as may be. It is our duty to
   search the Scriptures to see whether these things are so--and more--it
   is our wisdom to cry for Grace to appropriate each Truth and let it
   dwell in our inmost nature. It is time that we should be able to say,
   "This Truth of God is now as personally my own as if I had never heard
   it from lips of man! I receive it because it has been written on my own
   heart by the Lord, Himself. Its coming to me is not after men."

   There is an opinion current in certain circles that you must not
   receive anything unless it is taught you of men--the word, "men," being
   swallowed up and hidden away, but being there, after all, under the
   term--"the church." The church is set up as the great authority! If she
   has sanctioned it, you dare not question it! If she decrees, it is
   yours to obey! But this is to receive a gospel "after man" with a
   vengeance. And the process involved is a strange one. You must trace a
   dogma as coming through a continuous visible church and this will lead
   you through the Cloaca Maxima of old Rome. Though the Truth of God is
   manifestly clear and pure and proves itself to be the Water of Life to
   you, yet you must not accept it--you must take yourself to the mudded
   stream which can be traced through the foul channel of a continuous
   church, which for ages has apostatized!

   My dear Brethren, a doctrine's being believed by what may, in courtesy,
   be called "the church," is no voucher for it! The most of us would
   almost regard it as being a question to be raised whether teaching can
   be true which has been vouched for by those great worldly corporations
   which have usurped the name of churches of Christ. Several sects claim
   Apostolic succession and if any possess it, the Baptists are the most
   likely, since they practice the ordinances as they were delivered. But
   we do not even care to trace our pedigree through the long line of
   martyrs and of men abhorred by ecclesiastics. If we could do this
   without a break, the result would be of no value in our eyes, for the
   rag of "Apostolic succession" is not worth warehouse-room! Those who
   contend for the fiction may monopolize it if they will. We do not
   receive the Revelation of God because it has been received by a
   succession of fathers, monks, abbots and bishops! We are right glad
   when we perceive that certain of them saw the Truth of God and taught
   it--but that fact does not make it the Truth of God to us. We would,
   each one, say, "I make known to you, brethren, that the Gospel which
   was preached of me is not after man." We never think of quoting the
   community of men called "the church" as the ultimate authority with
   conscience. "We have not so learned Christ."

   Furthermore, I hope I shall speak for all of you here when I say that
   we have received the Truth of God personally by the revelation of it to
   our own souls by the Spirit of the Lord. Albeit that in so large a
   company as this I fear there may be a Judas, and the, "Lord, is it I?"
   may well be passed round with holy self-suspicion, yet we can all say,
   unless fearfully deceived, that we have received the Truth of God which
   we preach by the inward teaching of the Holy Spirit. Let us turn to our
   diaries, though the dates are now far away in the long-ago. We remember
   when the Light of God broke in and revealed our lost estate and thus
   began the groundwork of our teaching. Ah, Friends, the darker doctrines
   which make up the foil of the priceless jewels of the Gospel--do you
   not remember when you received them with power? That I was guilty, I
   believed, for I was so taught--but then and there I knew in my soul
   that it was so! Oh, how I knew it! Guilty before God, "condemned
   already," and lying under the present curse of a broken Law, I was
   sorely dismayed. I had heard the Law of God preached and I had trembled
   as I heard it, but now I felt an inward conviction of personal guilt of
   the most piercing character. I saw myself a sinner--and what a sight is
   that! Fearfulness took hold upon me and shame and dread. Then I saw how
   true was the doctrine of the sinfulness of sin--and what a punishment
   it must involve. That doctrine I no longer received of men!

   The precious doctrine of peace through the precious blood of Jesus we
   also know by inward personal teaching. We used to hear and sing of the
   great Sacrifice and of the love of Him who bore our sins in His own
   body on the tree. But now we stood at the foot of the Cross--for
   ourselves we beheld that dear face and gazed into the eyes so full of
   pity--and saw the hands and feet that were fastened to the wood for our
   sakes. Oh, when we saw the Lord Jesus, as our Surety, smarting for our
   offense, then we received the Truths of Redemption and Atonement in a
   way that was "not after man"!

   Yes, those gracious men who have gone to Heaven did preach the Gospel
   to us fully and earnestly--and they labored to make known Christ to us!
   But to reveal the Son of God in us was beyond their power! They could
   as easily have created a world as have made these Truths of God vital
   to us! We say, therefore, each one from his inmost soul, "I make known
   to you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me is not after
   man," so far as the way by which we have come to know and feel it
   within our own souls!

   Since our first days we have experienced a gradual opening up of the
   Gospel to our understanding, but in all that process, our real progress
   has been of God--not of men. Brethren, you read commentators--that is
   to say, if your own comments are worth hearing you read the books of
   godly men--that is to say, if you, yourselves, ever say anything worth
   reading, yet your spiritual learning, if it is true and real, is of the
   Lord's imparting. Do we learn anything, in the most emphatic sense of
   learning, unless we are taught of the Lord? Is it not essential that
   God the Spirit should lay home the Truth of God which has been spoken
   to you, even by the ablest instructor? You have continued to be
   students ever since you left College, but your Tutor has been the Holy
   Spirit. By no other method can our spirits learn the Truth of God but
   by the teaching of the Spirit of God. We can receive the shell and the
   outer form of theology, but the real Word of the Lord, itself, comes by
   the Holy Spirit who leads us into all Truth.

   How sweetly the Spirit has taught us in meditation! Have you not often
   been surprised and overcome with delight as Holy Scripture has opened
   up as if the gates of the Golden City had been set back for you to
   enter? I am sure that you did not, then, gather your knowledge from
   men, because it was all fresh to you as you sat alone with no book
   before you but the Bible and yourself receptive, scarcely thinking out
   matters, but drinking them in as the Lord brought them to you! A few
   minutes' silent openness of soul before the Lord has brought us in more
   treasure of Truth than hours of learned research! The Truth of God is
   something like those stalactite caverns and grottoes of which we have
   heard, which you must enter and see for yourself if you would really
   know their wonders. If you should venture there without light or guide,
   you would run great risks, but with blazing torch and an instructed
   leader, your entrance is full of interest. Look! Your guide has taken
   you through a narrow winding passage where you have to creep, or go on
   bended knees! At last he has brought you out into a magnificent hall
   and when the torches are held aloft, the far-off roof sparkles and
   flashes back the light as from countless jewels of every hue!

   You now behold Nature's architecture and cathedrals are, therefore,
   toys to you. As you stand in that vast pillared and jeweled palace, you
   feel how much you owe to your guide and to his flaming torch. Thus the
   Holy Spirit leads us into all Truth and sheds the Light of God on the
   eternal and the mysterious! This He does in certain cases very
   personally. Then He fills us with complete forgetfulness of all our
   immediate surroundings and we commune only with the Truth of God. I can
   well understand how philosophers, while working out an absorbing
   problem, have seemed lost and oblivious to all the world besides. Have
   you never felt a holy absorption in the Truth while the Spirit has
   filled you with its glorious vision? It has been so with many of the
   saints while taught of God. They are not likely to give up to popular
   clamor what they have thus received!

   How often has the Lord taught His servants His own Truth in the school
   of tribulation! We speak well of meditation--it is as silver--but
   tribulation is as much fine gold! Tribulation not only works patience,
   but patience brings experience and, in experience, there is a deep and
   intimate knowledge of the things of God which comes by no other means.
   Do you know what it is to be in such pain that you could not bear one
   more turn of the screw? And have you, then, in faintness fallen back
   upon your pillow and felt that even then you could not be more happy
   unless you were caught up to the third Heaven? Then has it been
   verified to some of us that we can do all things through Christ who
   strengthens us. While lying in passive peace, it may be you have seen a
   Scripture come forth like a star between the clouds of a tempest, and
   it has shone with such luster as only the Lord God could have given to
   it. Depression of spirit and torture of body have been forgotten while
   the bright promise has made your soul full of light!

   There is a place in the far-back desert which you can never forget.
   There grows a bush. A very unpromising object is a bush--but it is
   sacred to you--for there the Lord revealed Himself to you and the bush
   burned with fire, but was not consumed. You will never unlearn the
   lesson of the burning bush! Do we know any Truth of God till the Holy
   Spirit burns it into us--and engraves it on our soul as with an iron
   pen and with the point of a diamond? There are ways of learning for
   which we are very grateful, but the surest way of learning Divine Truth
   is by having the Word of God engrafted so as to take living hold upon
   the soul! Then we do not only believe it--we give our life to it--it
   lives in us and, at the same time, we live upon it! Such Truth throbs
   in every pulse, for it lives in us and colors our being. The devil
   insinuates questions, but we are not accountable for what he pleases to
   do, and we care the less, because he now whispers into a deaf ear. When
   once the soul, itself, has received the Truth of God, and it has come
   to permeate the entire being, we are not accessible to those doubts
   which before pierced us like poisoned arrows!

   I may add, concerning many of the Truths of God and the whole Gospel
   system, that we have learned the Truth, thereof, in the field of
   sacrifice and service with our Lord, so that to us it is not after man.
   If you do not believe in human depravity, accept a pastorate in this
   wicked London and if you are true to your commission, you will doubt no
   more! If you do not believe in the necessity of the Holy Spirit to
   regenerate, take charge over a cultured and polished congregation that
   will hear all your rhetoric, and will remain as worldly and as
   frivolous as it was before! If you do not believe in the power of the
   atoning blood, never go and see Believers die, for you will find that
   they trust in nothing else! A dying Christ is the last resort of the
   Believer--

   " When every earthly prop gives way He, then, is all my strength and
   stay"

   If you do not believe in the election of Grace, live where multitudes
   of men come under your notice and persons most unlikely are called out
   from among them in surprising ways--and it will grow upon you! Here
   comes one who says, "I have neither father, mother, brother, sister,
   nor friend who ever enters a place of worship." "How came you to
   believe?" "I heard a word in the street, Sir, quite by accident, that
   brought me to tremble before God." Here is the election of Grace! Here
   comes another, dark in mind, troubled in soul and she is a member of a
   family--all of them members of your Church--all happy and rejoicing in
   the Lord. And yet this poor creature cannot lay hold upon Christ by
   faith. To your great joy, you set before her Christ in all His fullness
   of Grace and she becomes the brightest of the whole circle, for they
   never knew the darkness as she did, and they can never rejoice in the
   Light of God as she delights in it! To find a greatly-loving saint you
   must find one who has had much forgiven.

   The woman that was a sinner is the only one that will wash Christ's
   feet. There is raw material in a Publican which you seldom find in a
   Pharisee. A Pharisee may polish up into an ordinary Christian, but
   somehow there is a charming touch about the pardoned sinner which is
   lacking in the other. There is an election of Grace and you cannot help
   noticing, as you go about, how certain Believers enter into the inner
   circle, while others linger in the outer courts. The Lord is Sovereign
   in His gifts and does as He wills--and we are called to bow before His
   scepter within the Church as well as at its portal. The longer I live,
   the more sure I am that salvation is all of Grace and that the Lord
   gives that Grace according to His own will and purpose.

   Once more, some of us have received the Gospel because of the wonderful
   unction that has gone with it at times to our souls. I hope that none
   of us will ever fall into the snare of following the guidance of
   impressions made upon us by texts which happen to come prominently
   before our minds. You have judgements and you must not lay them aside
   to be guided by impressions. But for all that and at the back of all
   that, there is not a man here that has led an eventful, useful life but
   must confess that certain of those acts of his life, upon which his
   whole history has hinged, are connected with influences upon his mind
   which were produced, as he believes, by supernatural agency! A passage
   of Holy Writ, which we have read a hundred times before, took us
   captive and became the master of every thought. We steered by it as men
   trust the pole-star and we found that our voyage was made easy thereby.
   Certain texts are, to our memory, sweet as wafers made with honey, for
   we know what they once did for us and the recollection is refreshing.
   We have been revived from a fainting fit, nerved for a desperate
   effort, or fired for a sacrifice by a Scripture which became no longer
   a word in a book, but the very voice of God to our soul--even that
   voice of the Lord which is full of majesty!

   Have you not noticed how a turn of a word in a text has made it seem
   all the more fitted for you? It looked a very small point, but it was
   essential to its effect, just as a small notch in a key may be the
   exact form which makes it fit the lock. How much may hang on what
   seems, to the unspiritual, to be nothing more than a slight verbal
   distinction, or an unimportant turn of expression! A thought of primary
   importance may turn upon the singular of plural of a word. If it is the
   Greek word, itself, the importance cannot be overestimated, but in an
   English word, in the translation, there may be well-near equal force
   according as the Word is true to the original. The many, who can only
   read our marvelous English Bible, come to prize its words because the
   Lord has blessed them to their souls. A simple Welsh friend believed
   that our Lord must have been a Welshman, because, he said, he always
   speaks to me in Welsh.

   To me it has often seemed as if the Well-Beloved of my soul had been
   born in my native village, had gone to my school and had passed through
   all my personal experiences, for He knows me better than I know myself.
   Although I know He was of Bethlehem and Judea, yet He seems like one of
   London, or of Surrey. No, more--I see in Him more than manhood could
   have made Him--I discern in Him a Nature more than that of man, for He
   enters the inmost recesses of my

   soul, He reads me like an open page, He comforts me as one brought up
   with me, He dives into my deepest griefs and attends me in my highest
   joys! I have secrets in my heart which only He knows. Would God His
   secret were with me as mine is with Him up to the measure of my
   capacity! It is because of that wonderful power which the Lord Jesus
   has over us through His sacred Word that we receive that Word from Him
   and receive it as not of man.

   What is unction, my Brothers? I fear that no one can help me by a
   definition. Who can define it? But yet we know where it is and we
   certainly feel where it is not. When that unction perfumes the Word of
   God, it is its own interpreter, it is its own apologist, it is it own
   confirmation and proof to the regenerate mind. Then the Word of God
   deals with us as no word of man ever did or could! We have not received
   it, therefore, of men. Constantly receiving the Divine Word as we do,
   it comes to us with an energy always fresh and forcible. It comes to
   us, especially, with a sanctifying power which is the very best proof
   of its coming from the thrice-holy God. Philosophers' words may teach
   us what holiness is, but God's Word makes us holy! We hear our Brethren
   exhort us to aspire to high degrees of Grace, but God's Word lifts us
   up to them! The Word is not merely an instrument of good, but the Holy
   Spirit makes it an active energy within the soul to purge the heart
   from sin so that it can be said, "You are clean through the Word which
   I have spoken unto you." When thus cleansed, you know that the Word is
   true. You are sure of it and you no longer need, even, the most
   powerful book of evidences. You have the witness in yourself, the
   evidence of things not seen, the seal of eternal verity.

   I have taken all this time upon how we receive the Gospel and,
   therefore, I must be brief upon a further point.

   II. TO US THE TRUTH ITSELF IS NOT AFTER MEN. I desire to assert this
   plainly. If any man thinks that the Gospel is only one of many
   religions, let him candidly compare the Scripture of God with other
   pretended revelations. Have you ever done so? I have made it a College
   exercise with our Brothers. I have said--We will read a chapter of the
   Koran. This is the Muslim's holy book. A man must have a strange mind
   who should mistake that rubbish for the utterances of Inspiration! If
   he is at all familiar with the Old and New Testaments, when he hears an
   extract from the Koran, he feels that he has met with a foreign
   author--the God who gave us the Pentateuch could have had no hand in
   many portions of the Koran!

   One of the most modern pretenders to inspiration is the Book of Mormon.
   I could not blame you should you laugh outright while I read aloud a
   page from that conglomeration. Perhaps you are familiar with the
   apocryphal New Testament books. It would be an insult to the judgement
   of the least in the Kingdom of Heaven to suppose that he could mistake
   the language of these forgeries for the language of the Holy Spirit! I
   have had several pretended revelations submitted to me by their several
   authors, for we have more of the prophetic clan about than most people
   know of, but not one of them has ever left on my mind the slightest
   suspicion of his sharing the Inspiration of John, or Paul. There is no
   mistaking the Inspired Books if you have any spiritual discernment!
   Once let the Divine Light dawn in the soul and you perceive a coloring
   and a fashion in the product of Inspiration which are not possible to
   mere men. Would one who doubts this write us a fifth Gospel? Would
   anyone among our poets attempt to write a new Psalm which could be
   mistaken for a Psalm of David? I do not see why he could not, but I am
   sure he cannot. You can give us new psalmody, for it is an instinct of
   the Christian life to sing the praises of God, but you cannot match the
   glory of Divinely-inspired songs. Therefore we receive the Scripture
   and, consequently, the Gospel as not after man.

   You say, perhaps, "You are comparing books and forgetting that your
   theme is the Gospel." But this is only in appearance. I do not care to
   waste your time by asking you to compare the gospels of men. There is
   not another gospel that I know of that is worth the comparison for a
   single minute. Oh, but, they say, there is a gospel that is much wider
   than yours. Yes, I know that it is much wider than mine, but to what
   does it lead? They say that what is nicknamed Calvinism has a very
   narrow door. There is a word in Scripture about a strait gate and a
   narrow way and, therefore, I am not alarmed by the accusation. But then
   there are rich pastures when you enter within and this renders it worth
   while to enter in by the strait gate! Certain other systems have very
   wide doors--but they lead you into small privileges--and those of a
   precarious tenure. I hear certain invitations which might run as
   follows--"Come you disconsolate! But if you come, you will still be
   disconsolate, for there will be no eternal life made sure to you and
   you must preserve your own souls, or perish after all." But I shall not
   enter into any comparisons, for they are odious in this case.

   The Gospel, our Gospel, is beyond the strain and reach of human
   thought. When men have exercised themselves to the very highest in
   original conceptions, they have never yet thought out the true Gospel.
   If it is such a commonplace thing as the critics would have us believe,
   why did it not arise in the minds of the Egyptians or Chinese? Great
   minds often run

   in the same grooves--why did not other great minds run in the same
   grooves as those of Moses, or Isaiah, or Paul? I think it is a fair
   thing to say that if it is such a commonplace form of teaching, it
   might have arisen among the Persians or Hindus, or, surely, we might
   have found something like it among the great teachers of Greece! Did
   any of these think out the doctrine of free and Sovereign Grace? Did
   they guess at the Incarnation and Sacrifice of the Son of God? No, even
   with the aid of our Inspired Book, no Muslim, to my knowledge, has
   taught a system of Grace in which God is glorified as to His justice,
   His love and His sovereignty. That sect has grasped a certain sort of
   predestination which it has defaced into blind faith, but even with
   that to help them, and the unity of the Godhead as a powerful light to
   aid them, they have never thought out a plan of salvation so just to
   God and so pacifying to the troubled conscience as the method of
   redemption by the substitution of our Lord Jesus!

   I will give you another proof, which, to my mind, is conclusive that
   our Gospel is not after men, and it is this--that it is immutable and
   nothing that man produces can be so called. If man makes a gospel--and
   he is very fond of doing it, like children making toys--what does he
   do? He is very pleased with it for a few moments and then he pulls it
   to pieces and makes it up in another way--and this continually! The
   religions of modern thought are as changeable as the mists on the
   mountains! Look how often science has altered its very basis! Science
   is notorious for being most scientific in destruction of all the
   science that has gone before it! I have sometimes indulged myself, in
   leisure moments, in reading ancient natural history--and nothing can be
   more comic. Yet this is by no means an abstruse science. In 20 years'
   time, some of us may probably find great amusement in the serious
   scientific teaching of the present hour, even as we do now in the
   systems of the last century. It may happen that in a little time the
   doctrine of evolution will be the standing jest of schoolboys. The same
   is true of the modern divinity which bows its knee in blind idolatry of
   so-called science.

   Now, we say, and do so with all our heart, that the Gospel which we
   preached 40 years ago, we will still preach in 40 years' time if we are
   alive. [Less than two years later, Brother Spurgeon began eternity in
   the Presence of his Master--EO.] And, what is more, that the Gospel
   which was taught of our Lord and His Apostles is the only Gospel now on
   the face of the earth! Ecclesiastics have altered the Gospel and if it
   had not been of God, it would have been stifled by falsehood long ago.
   But because the Lord has made it, it abides forever! Everything human
   is, before long, moon-struck, so that it shifts with every phase of the
   lunar orb. But the Word of the Lord is not after men, for it is the
   same yesterday, today and forever.

   It cannot be after men, again, because it is so opposed to human pride.
   Other systems flatter men, but this speaks the Truth of God. Hear the
   dreamers of today cry up the dignity of human nature! How sublime is
   man! But point me to a single syllable in which the Word of God sets
   itself to the extolling of man. On the contrary, it lays him in the
   very dust and reveals his condemnation! Where is boasting, then? It is
   excluded--the door is shut in its face. The self-glorification of human
   nature is foreign to Scripture which has for its grand object the Glory
   of God! God is everything in the Gospel which I preach and I believe
   that He is All in All in your ministry, also. There is a gospel in
   which the work and the glory are divided between God and man--and
   salvation is not altogether of Grace--but in our Gospel, salvation is
   of the Lord! Man never could nor would have invented and devised a
   Gospel which would lay him low and secure to the Lord God all the honor
   and praise. This seems to me to be clear beyond all question and,
   therefore, our Gospel is not after men.

   Again, it is not after men, because it does not give sin any quarter. I
   have heard that an Englishman has professed himself a Muslim because he
   is charmed by the polygamy which the Arabian Prophet allows his
   followers. No doubt the prospect of four wives would win converts who
   would not be attracted by spiritual considerations. If you preach a
   gospel which makes allowances for human nature and treats sin as if it
   were a mistake rather than a crime, you will find willing hearers. If
   you can provide absolution at small cost and can ease conscience by a
   little self-denial, it will not be amazing if your religion becomes
   fashionable. But our Gospel declares that the wages of sin is death and
   that we can only have eternal life as the gift of God--and that this
   gift always brings with it sorrow for sin, a hatred towards it and an
   avoidance

   of it!

   Our Gospel tells a man that he must be born again and that without the
   new birth he will be eternally lost, while with it he will obtain
   everlasting salvation! Our Gospel offers no excuse or cloak for sin,
   but utterly condemns it. It presents no pardon except through the great
   Atonement and it will give that man no security who tries to harbor any
   sin in his bosom. Christ died for sin--and we must die to sin, or die
   eternally. If we preach the Gospel faithfully, we must

   preach the Law of God. You cannot fully preach salvation by Christ
   without setting Sinai at the back of the picture and Calvary in the
   front! Men must be made to feel the evil of sin before they will prize
   the great Sacrifice which is the head and front of our Gospel. This is
   not to the taste of this or any other age and, therefore, I am sure man
   did not invent it.

   We know that the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is not of men because
   our Gospel is so suitable for the poor and illiterate. The poor,
   according to the usual fashion of men, are overlooked. Parliament has
   enclosed all the commons so that a poor man cannot keep a goose! I
   doubt not that, if it were likely to be effectual, we should soon hear
   of a bill for distributing freeholds of the stars among certain
   sky-lords! It is evident that a fine property in the celestial regions
   is, at the present time, unregistered in any of our courts. Well, they
   may sooner enclose and assign the sun, moon and stars than the Gospel
   of our Lord Jesus! This is the poor man's common. "The poor have the
   Gospel preached to them." Yet there are not a few, nowadays, who
   despise a Gospel which the common people can hear and understand! And
   we may be sure that a plain Gospel never came from them, for their
   taste does not lie in that direction. They want something abstruse, or,
   as they say, thoughtful. Do we not hear this sort of remark, "We are an
   intellectual people and need a cultured ministry. Those evangelistic
   preachers are all very well for popular assemblies, but we have always
   been select and require that preaching which is abreast of the times"?

   Yes, yes, and their man will be one who will not preach the Gospel
   unless it is in a clouded manner, for if he does declare the Gospel of
   Jesus, the poor will be sure to intrude themselves and shock my lords
   and ladies! Brothers, our Gospel does not know anything about high and
   low, rich and poor, black and white, cultured and uncultured! If it
   makes any difference, it prefers the poor and down-trodden. The great
   Founder of it says, "I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth,
   because You have hid these things from the wise and prudent and have
   revealed them unto babes." We praise God that He has chosen the base
   things and things that are despised! I hear it boasted of a man's
   ministry, although it gradually diminishes the congregation, that it is
   doing a great work among thoughtful young men. I confess that I am not
   a believer in the existence of these thoughtful young men--those who
   mistake themselves for such I have generally found to be more conceited
   than thoughtful. Young men are all very well and so are young women,
   and old women, also, but I am sent to preach the Gospel to every
   creature and I cannot limit myself to thoughtful young men! I make
   known to you that the Gospel which I have preached is not after men,
   for it knows nothing of selection and exclusiveness, but it values the
   soul of a sweep or a dustman at the same price as that of the Lord
   Mayor, or her Majesty!

   Lastly, we are sure that the Gospel we have preached is not after men,
   because men do not take to it. It is opposed, even to this day. If
   anything is hated bitterly, it is the out-and-out Gospel of the Grace
   of God, especially if that hateful word, Sovereignty is mentioned with
   it! Dare to say, "He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy, and He
   will have compassion on whom He will have compassion," and furious
   critics will revile you without stint! The modern religionist not only
   hates the doctrine of Sovereign Grace, but he raves and rages at the
   mention of it! He would sooner hear you blaspheme than preach Election
   by the Father, Atonement by the Son, or Regeneration by the Spirit. If
   you want to see a man worked up till the Satanic is clearly uppermost,
   let some of the new divines hear you preach a Free-Grace sermon! A
   gospel which is after men will be welcomed by men--but it needs a
   Divine operation upon the heart and mind to make a man willing to
   receive into his utmost soul this distasteful Gospel of the Grace of
   God!

   My dear Brothers, do not try to make it tasteful to carnal minds! Hide
   not the offense of the Cross lest you make it of no effect. The angles
   and corners of the Gospel are its strength--to pare them off is to
   deprive it of power! Toning down is not the increase of strength, but
   the death of it. Why, even among the sects, you must have noticed that
   their distinguishing points are the horns of their power--and when
   these are practically omitted, the sect is effete. Learn, then, that if
   you take Christ out of Christianity, Christianity is dead! If you
   remove Grace out of the Gospel, the Gospel is gone! If the people do
   not like the Doctrines of Grace, give them all the more of them!
   Whenever its enemies rail at a certain kind of gun, a wise military
   power will provide more of such artillery. A great general, going in
   before his king, stumbled over his own sword. "I see, said the king,
   your sword in is the way." The warrior answered, "Your Majesty's
   enemies have often felt the same." That our Gospel offends the King's
   enemies is no regret to us!

   Dear Friends, if it is so that we have not received the Gospel from
   man, but from God, let us continue to receive the Truth of God by the
   Divinely-appointed channel of faith. Are you sure that you always will,
   to the fullest, understand the Truth of God? With most of us, the
   understanding is like a narrow rear gate to the city of Mansoul, and
   the great things of God cannot be so cut down as to be brought in by
   that entrance. The door is not wide enough! But our city has a great

   gate called faith, through which even the infinite and eternal may be
   admitted. Give over the hopeless effort of dragging into the mind by
   efforts of reason, that which can so readily dwell in you by the Holy
   Spirit through faith! We that speak against rationalism are, ourselves,
   apt to reason too much--and there is nothing so unreasonable as to hope
   to receive the things of God by reasoning them out! Let us believe them
   upon the Divine testimony--and when they try us and even when they seem
   to grate upon the sensibilities of humanity--let us receive them, none
   the less, for all that. We are not to be judges of what God's Truth
   ought to be--we are to accept it as the Lord reveals it.

   Next, let us, each one, expect opposition if he receives the Truth from
   the Lord, and especially opposition from one person who is both near
   and dear to him--namely, himself. There is a certain old man who is yet
   alive and he is no lover of the Truth of God, but, on the contrary, he
   is a partisan of falsehood. I heard a gracious policeman say that when
   he stood in Trafalgar Square and fellows of the baser sort kicked him
   and the other police, he felt a bone of the old man stirring within
   him. Ah, we have felt that bone, too often! The carnal nature opposes
   the Truth of God, for it is not reconciled to God, neither, indeed, can
   be! Let us pray the Lord to conquer our pride, that His Truth may
   dominate us, despite our evil hearts! As to the outside world opposing,
   we are not at all alarmed by that fact, for it is exactly what we were
   taught to expect. We are now unmoved by opposition. The captain of a
   ship minds not if a little spray breaks over him.

   Remember that if you did not receive the Truth except through the power
   of the Spirit of God, you cannot expect others to do so. They will not
   believe your report unless the arm of the Lord is revealed to them. But
   then, if faith is the Holy Spirit's work, we need not fear that men can
   destroy it. Those who attempt to change our belief may well be a little
   dubious as to their success in the task they have undertaken. If faith
   is a Divine work within our souls, we may defy all sophistries,
   flatteries, temptations and threats. We shall be divinely
   obstinate--those who would pervert us will have to give us up! Possibly
   they will call us bigots, or hard-shells, or even idiots--but this,
   too, also signifies little if our names are written in Heaven!

   Let us also conclude from our subject that if these things come to us
   from God, we can safely rest our all upon them. If they came to us of
   men, they would probably fail us in a crisis. Did you ever trust men
   and not rue the day before the sun was down? Did you ever rely on an
   arm of flesh without discovering that the best of men are men at the
   best? But if these things come of God, they are eternal and all
   sufficient! We can both live and die upon the everlasting Gospel! Let
   us deal more and more with God and with Him, only. If we have obtained
   Light from Him, there is more of blessing to be had. Let us go to that
   same Teacher, that we may learn more of the deep things of God. Let us
   bravely believe in the success of the Gospel which we have received. We
   believe in it--let us believe for it. We will not despair though the
   whole visible Church should apostatize!

   When invaders had surrounded Rome and all the country lay at their
   mercy, a piece of land was to be sold and a Roman bought it at a fair
   value. The enemy was there, but he would not be dislodged. The enemy
   might destroy the Roman State. Let him try it! Be you of the same mind!
   The God of Jacob is our Refuge and none can stand against His eternal
   power and Godhead. The everlasting Gospel is our banner and, with
   Jehovah to maintain it, our standard never shall be lowered! In the
   power of the Holy Spirit, the Truth of God is invincible! Come on, you
   hosts of Hell and armies of the aliens! Let craft and criticism,
   rationalism and priestcraft do their best! The Word of the Lord endures
   forever--even that Word which, by the Gospel, is preached unto men!

Our Expectation

   (No. 2186)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall see His seed." Isaiah 53:10.

   THE first thought suggested by this text is that Jesus is still alive,
   for to see anything is the act of a living person. Our Lord Jesus died.
   We know that He died. We are glad that there is overwhelming evidence
   that, not in appearance, but in fact, He died. His side was pierced. He
   was given up by the Roman authorities for burial--the imperial
   authorities were sure of His death. The soldier had made assurance
   doubly sure by piercing His side. His disciples buried Him. They would
   not have left Him in the cave if they had felt any doubt about His
   death. They went in the morning after the Sabbath to embalm Him. They
   were all persuaded that He had really died. Blessed be the dying
   Christ! Here our living hopes take their foundation. If He had not
   died, we must have died forever. The more assured we are of His death,
   the more assured we feel of the life of all who are in Him!

   But, my Brothers and Sisters, He is not dead. Some years ago, someone,
   wishing to mock our holy faith, brought out a handbill which was
   plastered everywhere--"Can you trust in a dead man?" Our answer would
   have been, "No. Nobody can trust in a man who is dead." But it was
   known by those who printed the bill that they were misrepresenting our
   faith. Jesus is no longer dead! He rose again the third day. We have
   sure and Infallible proofs of it. It is an historical fact, better
   proved than almost any other which is commonly received as historical,
   that He did really rise again from the grave. He arose no more to die.
   He has gone out of the land of tears and death. He has gone into the
   region of immortality. He sits at the right hand of God, even the
   Father, and He reigns there forever. We love Him that died, but we
   rejoice that He who died is not dead, but always lives to make
   intercession for us!

   Dear children of God, do not be afraid that Christ's work will break
   down because He is dead. He lives to carry it on. That which He
   purchased for us by His death, He lives to secure for us by His life.
   Do not let your faith be a sort of dead faith dealing with a dead
   man--let it be instinct with life, with warm blood in its veins. Go to
   your own Christ, your living Christ--make Him your familiar Friend, the
   Acquaintance of your solitude, the Companion of your pilgrimage. Do not
   think that there is a great gulf between you, a living man, and Him.
   The shades of death do not divide you from Him. He lives, He feels, He
   sympathizes, He looks on, He is ready to help, He will help you even
   now. You have come in to the place where prayer is known to be made,
   burdened and troubled and you seek relief. Let the thought that your
   Lord is a living Friend ease you of your burden. He is still ready to
   be your strong Helper and to do for you what He did for needy ones in
   the days of His sojourn here below. I want even you, who do not know
   Him, to remember that He lives, that you may seek Him tonight--that
   before another sun shall rise you may find Him and, finding Him, may,
   yourselves, be found and saved. Do not try to live without the living,
   loving Friend of sinners! Seek His healing hand, then beg for His
   company. Get it. Keep it and you shall find that it makes life below
   like Heaven above! When you live with the living Christ, you will live,
   indeed! In Him is the Light of God and the Light of God is the life of
   men!

   And now to the text itself, with brevity. I have to observe upon it,
   first, that Christ's death produced a posterity. "When you shall make
   His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed." Evidently the
   death of Christ was fruitful of a seed for Him. Secondly, that
   posterity remains. Our Lord Jesus Christ does not look, today, on
   emptiness--He is not bereaved of His household, but He still sees His
   seed. And, thirdly and lastly, that posterity is under His immediate
   eyes at all times, for, "He shall see His seed."

   I. Well, first of all, THE DEATH OF CHRIST HAS PRODUCED A POSTERITY. We
   do not read, here, that the Lord Christ has followers. That would be
   true, but the text prefers to say He has a seed. We read, just now,
   that the Lord Jesus has disciples. That would be distinctly true, but
   the text does not so read. It says, "He shall see His seed." Why His

   seed? Why, because everyone who is a true follower or disciple of
   Christ has been born by a new birth from Him into the position of
   disciple. There is no knowing Christ except through the new birth. We
   are naturally sold under sin and we cannot discern the spiritual and
   real Christ until we have a spirit created within us by the new birth,
   of which He said, "You must be born again." This is the gate of
   entrance into discipleship! None can be written in the roll of
   followers of Christ unless they are also written in the register of the
   family of God--"this and that man was born there." Other men can get
   disciples for themselves by the means that are usual for such ends, but
   all the disciples of Christ are produced by miracle. They are all
   discipled by being newly-created! Jesus, as He looks upon them all, can
   say, "Behold, I make all things new." They all come into the world, of
   which He is King, by being born into it. There is no other way into the
   first world but by birth--and there is no other way into the second
   world, wherein dwells righteousness, but by birth-- and that birth is
   strictly connected with the pangs of the Savior's passion, "when you
   shall make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed." See,
   then, the reason why we have here the remarkable expression--"His
   seed."

   Learn from this that all who truly follow Christ and are saved by Him,
   have His life in them. The parent's life is in the child. From the
   parent that life has been received. It is Christ's life that is in
   every true Believer--"For you are dead and your life is hid with Christ
   in God; when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you,
   also, appear with Him in glory." We have our natural life and this
   makes us men--we have our spiritual life and this makes us Christians.
   We take life from our parents--this links us with the first Adam. We
   have taken life from Christ--this joins us to the second Adam. Do not
   mistake me, that same life which abides in Christ, at the right hand of
   God, is that everlasting life which He has bestowed upon all those who
   put their trust in Him. That water springing up into everlasting life
   He gave us. He made it to be in us a well of water springing up. The
   first drops of that living spring, the whole outcome of the spring, and
   the spring itself, came from Him!

   Let me put it to you, Beloved Hearers. Do you know anything about this
   new birth? Do you know anything about this Divine Life? There are
   multitudes of religious people, very religious people--but they are as
   dead as doornails! Multitudes of religious persons are like waxworks,
   well-proportioned and you might mistake them, by candlelight, for life.
   But in the Light of God you would soon discover that there is a mighty
   difference, for the best that human skill can do is a poor imitation of
   real life. You, dear Hearer, dressed in the garments of family religion
   and adorned with the jewels of moral virtue, may be nothing beyond "a
   child of nature finely dressed, but not the living child." God's living
   children may not seem to be quite so handsome, nor so charmingly
   arrayed as you are and, in their own esteem, they may not be worthy to
   consort with you, but there is a solemn difference between the living
   child and the dead child, however you may try to conceal it! Righteous
   men know themselves to be sinners--sinners believe themselves to be
   righteous men. There is more Truth of God in the fear of the first than
   there can be in the faith of the second, for the faith of the second is
   founded on lies. Beloved, we become, I say again, the followers of
   Christ by being made partakers of His life--and unless His life is in
   us, we may say what we will about Christ and profess what we like about
   following Him--but we are not in the secret! We are out of the
   spiritual world altogether--that world of which He is the Head, the
   Creator, the Lord. You see why the word, "seed," is used? We come to
   Him by birth--we are partakers of His life.

   Furthermore, Believers in our Lord are said to be His seed because they
   are like He. I wish that I could say this with less need to qualify it,
   but the man who really believes in Jesus and in whom the diving life is
   strong and powerful, is like Jesus and especially like Jesus in
   this--that, as the Christ consecrated Himself wholly to God's service
   and Glory, so has the Believer done. And as the Christ founded His
   successes on being dead and buried, surrendering honor, comfort and
   life, itself, for His work, so should the true Believer be willing to
   give up anything and everything, that He may achieve His life-purpose
   and bring glory to God.

   "As He is, so are we in this world"--that is, we are bent upon the
   glory of God, filled with love to men and anxious for their
   salvation--that God may be glorified thereby. You know best, Brothers
   and Sisters, whether this is true of you. But if we have not the Spirit
   of Christ, we are none of His. If we are not like Christ, it is not
   possible that we are His seed, for the seed is like the parent. Surely,
   children are like their father--not all to the same degree--but still,
   there is the evidence of their sonship in their likeness to him from
   whom they came. Our Lord's true people are like He, or they could not
   be styled, "His seed." Alas, the old nature blots and blurs the
   resemblance! The stamp of the first Adam is not altogether removed, but
   it ought to grow fainter and fainter while the lines of the Divine
   portrait should grow stronger and

   clearer. Is this the experience of our life in Christ? I pray that it
   may be so. It should cause us great searching of heart if there is not
   in us an increasing likeness to our Lord.

   There is also this to be said for those who are called His seed--that
   they seek the same ends and expect to receive the same reward. We are
   towards Christ, His seed, and thus we are heirs to all that He
   has--heirs to His business on earth, heirs to His estate in Heaven. We
   are to be witnesses to the Truth as Jesus was--and to go about doing
   good as He did-- and to seek and save the lost after His example. This
   we must inherit, as a son follows his father's business. All that
   Christ has, belongs to His seed. As a man hands down to his posterity,
   his possessions, Christ Jesus has made over to His people all that He
   is and all that He has--and all that He ever will be, that they may be
   with Him, behold His Glory--and shine with Him as the stars forever and
   ever! We are His seed in this respect--that He has taken us into His
   family and given us the family patrimony--and made us partakers of all
   things in Himself.

   Now, Beloved, this is all through His death. We are made His seed
   through His death. Why principally through His death? Why, because it
   was by reason of His death for us that the Father could come and deal
   with us, and the Spirit could breathe upon us and new-create us! There
   was no dealing with us by a just God until the atoning Sacrifice had
   rolled away the stone that blocked the way, namely, the necessity that
   sin should be punished. Christ, having died for us, we came into
   another relation to justice and it became possible for us to be
   regenerated and brought into the household of God. Beloved, I think
   that you know, in your own experience, that it was His death that
   really operated most upon you in the matter of your conversion. I hear
   a great talk about the example of Christ having great effect upon
   ungodly men, but I do not believe it and certainly have never seen it!
   It has great effect upon men when they are born again and are saved
   from the wrath to come--and are full of gratitude on this account--but
   before that happens, we have known men admire the conduct of Christ and
   even write books about the beauty of His Character, while, at the same
   time, they have denied His Godhead! Thus they have rejected Him in His
   essential Character and there has been no effect produced upon their
   conduct by their cold admiration of His life.

   But when a man comes to see that He is pardoned and saved through the
   death of Jesus, He is moved to gratitude and then to love. "We love Him
   because He first loved us." That love which He displayed in His death
   has touched the mainspring of our being and moved us with a passion to
   which we were strangers before. And, because of this, we hate the sins
   that once were sweet. And we turn with all our hearts to the obedience
   that once was so unpleasant. There is more effect in faith in the blood
   of Christ to change the human character than in every other
   consideration. The Cross once seen, sin is crucified! The passion of
   the Master once apprehended as being endured for us, we then feel that
   we are not our own, but are bought with a price. This perception of
   redeeming love, in the death of our Lord Jesus, makes all the
   difference-- this prepares us for a higher and a better life than we
   have ever known before. It is His death that does it!

   And now, Beloved, if by His death we have become His seed, (and I think
   I speak at this time to many who can truly say they hope that it is so
   with them), then let us consider the fact for a minute. We are His
   seed. They speak of the seed royal. What shall I say of the seed of
   Christ? Believer, you may be a poor person living in an obscure lane,
   but you are of the imperial house! You are ignorant and unlettered, it
   may be, and your name will never shine in the roll of science, but He
   who is the Divine Wisdom acknowledges you as one of His seed! It may be
   that you are sick--even now your head is aching, your heart is
   faint--you feel that, by-and-by, you will die. Ah, well, but you are of
   His seed who died and rose and is gone into Glory! You are of the seed
   of Him "who only has immortality." You may put away your crowns, you
   kings and emperors--earth, yellow earth, hammered and decorated with
   other sparkling bits of soil--you may put them all away, as altogether
   outdone in value! We have crowns infinitely more precious and we belong
   to a royal house tran-scendently more glorious than any of yours!

   But then it follows, if we are thus of a seed, that we ought to be
   united and love each other more and more. Christian people, you ought
   to have a clannish feeling! "Oh," says one, "you mean that the Baptists
   ought to get together!" I do not mean anything of the kind! I mean that
   the seed of Christ should be of one heart and we ought to recognize
   that wherever the life and love of Jesus are to be found, there our
   love goes out! It is very delightful, at Christmas time, or perhaps at
   some other time in the year, for all the family to meet. And though
   your name may be, "Smith," or, "Brown," yet you feel there is some
   importance in your name when all your clan have met together. It may be
   a name that is very common, or very obscure, but, somehow, you feel
   quite great on that day when all the members of the family have joined
   to keep united holiday. Your love to one another gathers warmth as the
   glowing coals are drawn together.

   So may it be in your heart towards all those that belong to Christ! You
   are of the blood royal of Heaven! You are neither a Guelph nor a
   Hohenzollern, but you are a Christian! And that is a greater name than
   all! He has a seed--even He whom, unseen, we, this night, adore. My
   inmost soul glories in the Head of my clan--in Him of the pierced hands
   and the nailed feet--who wears for His princely star the lance mark in
   His side! Oh, how blessedly bright is He! How transcendently glorious
   are the nail prints! We adore Him in the infinite majesty of His
   unutterable love! We are of His seed and so we are near akin to Him. Do
   not think that I am too familiar. I go not beyond the limit which this
   Word of God allows me, no, I have scarcely come up to the edge of it!
   We are truly of the seed of Jesus, even as the Jews are of the seed of
   Israel--not born after the flesh, for He had none born to Him in that
   way--but born after the Spirit, wherein His seed is as the stars of
   Heaven! We rejoice with exultation as we read the text, "He shall see
   His seed."

   Thus much on our first point.

   II. Now, my second point is THAT POSTERITY OF HIS REMAINS. Our Lord
   always has a seed. That seems to me to be clear from the indefiniteness
   of the text. It does not say that He shall see His seed for so long and
   then no longer, but it stands as a prophecy fulfilled, always
   fulfilling and always to be fulfilled--"He shall see His seed." Christ
   will always have a seed to see. His Church, then, will never die out
   while the world stands and, throughout eternity, that seed must still
   exist in the endless state, for world without end our Lord Jesus shall
   see His seed!

   I notice that the word is in the plural--"He shall see His seeds," as
   though some were truly His seed and yet, for a time, at least, differed
   from the rest. Our Lord said of those not yet converted, "Other sheep I
   have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring." And again,
   "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe
   on Me through their word." Christ will see generation after generation
   of those redeemed by His blood who shall be born into His family and
   shall call Him blessed! Instead of the fathers, shall be the children,
   whom He will make princes in all the earth! The Septuagint reads it,
   "He shall see a long-lived seed." Though I do not think that the
   version is correct, still, it shows that it was thought and believed
   that the Messiah would have a perpetual seed. Certainly it is so.
   Beloved, if it had been possible to destroy the Church of God on earth,
   it would have been destroyed long ago! The malice of Hell has done all
   that it could do to destroy the seed of Christ--the seed that sprang
   from His death.

   Standing in the Coliseum at Rome, I could not, as I looked around on
   the ruins of that vast house of sin, but praise God that the Church of
   God existed, though the Coliseum is in ruins! Anyone standing there,
   when the thousands upon thousands gloated their eyes with the
   sufferings of Christians, would have said, "Christianity will die out,
   but the Coliseum, so firmly built will stand to the end of time!" But
   lo, the Coliseum is a ruin and the Church of God more firm, more
   strong, more glorious than ever! Only read the story of the
   persecutions under Nero and under Diocletian, in the olden times, and
   you will wonder that Christianity survived the cruel blows. Every form
   of torture which devils could invent was inflicted upon Christian men
   and women! Not here and there, but everywhere, they were hunted down
   and persecuted. It makes one tremble with horror as he reads of women
   tossed on the horns of bulls, or set in red-hot iron chairs--and men
   smeared with honey to be stung to death by wasps, or dragged at the
   heels of wild horses, or exposed to savage beasts in the amphitheatre.

   But I will say no more about it. The gallant vessel of the Church
   plowed the red waves of a crimson sea, her prow scarlet with gore, but
   the ship itself was the better for its washing and sailed all the more
   gallantly because of boisterous winds. As to our own country, read the
   story of persecutions here. You will have enough if you only read
   Foxe's "Book of Martyrs." I wish that every house had in it a
   large-typed copy of the "Book of Martyrs." Well do I recollect, as a
   child, how many hours, how many days, I spent looking at the pictures
   in an old-fashioned "Book of Martyrs," and wondering how the men of God
   suffered, as they did, so bravely. I remember how I used to turn to
   that boy of Brentford, who was first beaten with rods and afterwards
   tied to the stake, to cheerfully burn for Christ's sake. I am reminded,
   by the effect which it had upon my mind, of what was said of a certain
   ancient Church in this city of London, which was greatly persecuted.

   Many, many years ago, a number of persons were noticed to be going
   towards Smithfield, early one morning, and somebody said, "Where are
   you going?" "We are going to Smithfield." "What for?" "To see our
   pastor burnt." "Well, but what, in the name of goodness, do you want to
   see him burnt for? What can be the good of it?" They answered, "We go
   to see him burn that we may learn the way." Oh, but that was grand! "To
   learn the way!" Then the rank and file of

   the followers of Jesus learned the way to suffer and die as the leaders
   of the Church set the example! Yet the Church in England was not
   destroyed by persecution, but it became more mighty than ever because
   of the opposition of its foes!

   Since then there have been laborious attempts to destroy the Church of
   Christ by error. One hundred years ago or so, throughout the most of
   our Dissenting Churches, a sort of Unitarianism was triumphant. The
   essential doctrines of the Gospel were omitted, the pith of it was
   taken away, the marrow was torn out of its bones. The Church of England
   was asleep, too, and everywhere it seemed as if there was a kind of
   orthodox heterodoxy that did not believe anything in particular, and
   did not hold that there was a doctrine worth anybody's living for or
   dying for--but that all religious teaching should be like a nose of
   wax--that you might shape whichever way you liked. It looked as if the
   living Church of God would be extinguished altogether. But it was not
   so, for God did but stamp His foot and, from all parts of the country,
   men like Mr. Wesley and Mr. Whitefield came to the front--and hundreds
   of others, mighty men of valor-- proclaimed the Gospel with unusual
   power! And away went the bats and the owls back to their proper
   dwelling place! The same mischievous experiment is being tried now, and
   there will be the same result, for the living Christ is still to the
   front. The King is not off the ground, yet! The battle will be won by
   His armies. Jehovah has declared His decree, "Yet have I set My King
   upon My holy hill of Zion." Our Lord shall yet see His seed on the
   conquering hand.

   Worldliness has gone a long way to destroy the Church of God. I judge
   it to be the worst cankerworm that assails us. Persons come into the
   Church with a profession which they never carry out. Have we not all
   around us persons who say that they are Christians and are not, but
   lie? And many who, we hope, are Christians, are but very
   poverty-stricken specimens of the race, with little love, little zeal,
   (indeed, they are afraid to be too zealous), little searching of the
   Word, little prayer, little consecration, little communion with God.
   They are enough to kill all hope of better things. The Lord have mercy
   upon His poor Church when she comes to be neither cold nor hot, so that
   He is ready to spue her out of His mouth! Yet, the lukewarm can still
   be heated! The cause is not dead! "He shall see His seed."

   Take it as a standing miracle that there are any godly people on the
   face of the earth, for there would not be one were it not for the
   exertion of miraculous power! Christianity is not a natural growth--it
   is constantly a Divine creation. Christian life needs to daily have the
   baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Church must perpetually receive fresh
   light and life from above, or else it would die--but still stands the
   promise, "He shall see His seed." While sun and moon endure, there
   shall be a people who follow the Lamb! And even though they are so few
   that Elijah might say, "I, only I, am left, and they seek my life to
   take it away," God will reserve to Himself thousands that have not
   bowed the knee to Baal!

   III. And now I am to wind up with this third thought--THIS POSTERITY IS
   ALWAYS UNDER THE IMMEDIATE EYES OF CHRIST. "He shall see His seed." Oh,
   I like this, "He shall see His seed"! He sees them when they are first
   born anew. I keep looking out from this pulpit for that small portion
   of them that may be born in this place--and there are many watchful
   Brothers and Sisters here who try to speak to all that come into the
   place in whom there are movings of the Spirit. If there is an anxious
   soul, they seek to find him out. We cannot see them all, but HE shall
   see His seed! Sometimes it is a question whether they are His seed or
   not--a very great question with themselves, but none with Him--He sees
   His seed! Some are seeking--they have hardly found. They are
   longing--they have scarcely realized the way of faith. Ah, well, He
   sees your first desires, your humble breathings, your lowly hopes, your
   trembling approaches. He sees you! There is not a child of His, born in
   any out-of-the-way place, but what He perceives him at once! He
   observes The first living cry, the first living tear. "He shall see His
   seed." What a mercy to have such a Watcher! We poor earthly pastors are
   of small use, but this great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, with eyes
   that never miss a single new-born lamb of Grace--what a mercy to have
   such a Shepherd to look after the whole flock! "He shall see His seed."

   Yes, and ever afterward, wherever His seed may wander, He still sees
   them. Some of you, perhaps, have lived long in England, but you are
   contemplating going far away--to Australia or America. You wonder
   whether you will meet with any friend who will help you spiritually. Do
   not fear. "He shall see His seed." "Rivers unknown to song are not
   unknown to God." And if you should have to dwell quite alone in the
   bush, and have no Christian acquaintance, still go directly to the Son
   of God, for, "He shall see His seed." The eyes of Christ are never off
   from the eye of faith. If you look to Him, you may rest well assured
   that He looks to you!

   The beauty of it is that this look of Christ, whereby He sees His seed,
   is one of intense delight. I cannot preach upon that most precious
   topic, but I wish you to think it over--it is a Divine pleasure to the
   Lord Jesus to look at you--it is promised Him as a reward for His
   death! Mother, you know, yourself, what a pleasure it has been for you
   to look at your

   daughter and watch her grow up. You would not like to tell her all you
   have thought of her--you have looked at her with intense delight. Now,
   the Lord Jesus Christ looks at you in just the same way! Love is blind,
   they say. Jesus is not blind and He sees in His people much more than
   they ever will see in themselves! He sees their hopes, their desires,
   their aspirations. And He often takes the will for the deed and marks
   that for a beauty which now may be half-developed and, therefore, not
   all we could wish it to be. It is, at present, the caricature of a
   virtue--but it is well meant and will come right. And the Lord sees it
   as it will be--and He rejoices in it! Oh, what blessed eyes those are
   of His that can spy out beauties which only He can see! Since He has
   created them and put them there, himself, He sees them! "He shall see
   His seed." He suffered so much for our redemption that He must love us.
   We cost Him so much that He must delight in us--

   "The Son with joy looks down and sees

   The purchase of His agonies."

   "He shall see His seed."

   Brothers and Sisters, our Savior will always behold His redeemed ones!
   He will see all His seed to the last. When they come to the river which
   divides them from the celestial country, "He shall see His seed." It
   may possibly be gloomy with some of you, but it is not often dark at
   death-time. Many of the Lord's children have a fine candle to go to bed
   with. Even if they go to bed in the dark, they fall asleep the sooner.
   But in either case, their Lord will see them if they cannot see Him.
   When you can see nothing and the brain begins to reel--and thought and
   memory flee--He sees His seed!

   But what a seed He will have to see in the morning! I am not yet an old
   man, as some suppose from the many years of my ministry, but I am often
   looking forward to that blessed morning when all the sacred seed shall
   meet around the Throne of God. I believe the Christ will come in to see
   all His beloved purchased ones and He will search to see whether we are
   all there. Then shall the sheep pass again under the hand of Him that
   counts them--and He will count them, for He knows whom He bought with
   His blood--and He will see that they are there in full tale. I think
   that I hear the reading of the register, the muster roll. Will you be
   there to answer to your name?

   Dear Friends, all the Lord's seed will be there--all that were born
   into His house with a new birth. They shall answer, "Yes, yes, yes, we
   are here! We are here!" Oh, but the joy we shall have in being
   there--the delight in beholding His face! Yet, if all our joys are put
   together, they will not equal the joy that He will have when He finds
   them all there for whom He shed His blood--all whom the Father gave
   Him--all who gave themselves to Him--all who were born as His seed--not
   one lost! "Of all whom You have given Me, I have lost none." Oh, the
   joy, the delight, of our Well-Beloved in that day! Then shall He see
   His seed!

   And I believe that it will be a part of His Heaven for Him to look upon
   His redeemed. He is the Bridegroom, they make up the bride--and the
   bridegroom's joy is not in seeing his bride for once on the wedding
   day, but he takes delight in her as long as they both live! A true
   husband and a true spouse are always lovers--they are always linked
   together by strong ties of affection. And it is so with that model
   Husband, the Lord Christ and His perfect Church above. He loves His
   people no less and He could not love them any more than when He died
   for them, and so, forever, "He shall see His

   seed."

   Thus have I talked with you in a very poor and feeble way, as far as my
   speech is concerned. But the doctrine is not feeble, the Gospel is not
   poor! O you that are the seed of Christ, go out and magnify Him by your
   lives! Be worthy of your high calling. Show the nobility of your
   pedigree by the magnanimity of your lives!

   And you that are not among His seed, look where you are! What can you
   do? All that you can do will bring you no further--you must be born
   again--and this is the work of the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God
   works the new birth in His own way, but He works according to the
   Gospel. What is the Gospel? "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." I give you the Gospel without mutilating it, just as I get it
   in the Gospel by Mark, "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." Obey the precept and the promise is yours! God help you to
   believe in the Lord Jesus and so to have eternal life! The moment you
   believe in Jesus Christ you are born again. May He, by His Holy Spirit,
   seal the message with His blessing to everyone in this house, for His
   own name's sake! Amen.

Jesus--"All Blessing and All Blessed"

   (No. 2187)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Men shall be blessed in Him: all nations shall call Him blessed."
   Psalm 72:17.

   THERE are many famous names in human history, but many of them are
   connected with deeds which have brought no blessing upon mankind. To
   bless and to be blessed is the noblest sort of fame and yet how few
   have thought it worth the seeking! Full many a name in the roll of fame
   has been written there with a finger dipped in blood. It would seem as
   if men loved those most who have killed the most of them! They call
   those greatest who have been the greatest cutthroats! They make their
   greatest illuminations over massacres of their fellows, calling them
   victories. To be set aloft upon a column, or represented by a public
   statue, or to have poets ringing out your name, it seems necessary to
   grasp the sword and to hack and slay your fellow men! Is it not too
   sadly true that when men have been cursed by one of their leaders,
   they, from then on call him great? O misery, that wholesale murder
   should be the shortest method of becoming illustrious!

   There is one name that will last when all others shall have died
   out--and that name is connected with blessing--and only with blessing.
   Jesus Christ came into the world on purpose to bless men. Men, as a
   race, find in Him a blessing wide as the world. While He was here, He
   blessed and cursed not. All around Him, both by speech, act, glance and
   thought, He was an Incarnate blessing. All that came to Him, unless
   they willfully rejected Him, obtained blessings at His hands. The home
   of His infancy, the friends of His youth, the comrades of His manhood,
   He blessed unsparingly! He labored to bless men. To bless men, He
   parted with everything and became poor. To bless men, at last He died.
   Those outstretched hands upon the Cross are spread wide in
   benediction--and they are fastened there as if they would remain
   outstretched till the whole world is blessed!

   Our Lord's resurrection from the dead brings blessings to mankind. He
   has won for us redemption from the grave and eternal life. He waited on
   earth, a while, until He ascended, blessing men as He went up. His last
   attitude below the skies was that of pronouncing a blessing upon His
   disciples. He is gone into Glory, but He has not ceased to bless our
   race. The Holy Spirit came among us soon after the Ascension, because
   Jesus had received gifts for men--yes, also for the rebellious. The
   wonderful blessings which are comprised in the work, Person and offices
   of the Holy Spirit--all these come to us through Jesus Christ, the
   ever-blessed and ever-blessing One! He still loves to bless. Standing
   at the helm of all affairs, He guides the tiller of Providence with a
   view to the blessing of His chosen. He still spends His time in making
   intercession for transgressors, that the blessing of God may rest upon
   them, while His Spirit, who is His Vicegerent here below, is always
   occupied with blessing the sons of men.

   Our Lord Jesus will soon come a second time and in that glorious hour,
   though His left hand must deal out justice, His right hand will lavish
   blessing! His chief end and bent in His coming will be that He may
   largely bless those loving hearts that watch for His appearing. Christ
   is all blessing. When you have written down His name, you have pointed
   to the Fountain from which all blessings flow--you have named that Sun
   of Righteousness to whose beams we owe every good and perfect gift!
   From the beginning, throughout all eternity, the Lord Jesus blesses
   men--

   "Over every foe victorious,

   He on His Throne shall rest!

   From age to age more glorious

   All blessing and all blessed.

   The tide of time shall never

   His covenantremove,

   His name shall stand forever,

   That name to us is--Love."

   I purpose, at this time, if the Lord shall help me, to speak very
   simply about the fullness of blessing which comes from our Master and
   Lord. First saying, dear Friends, that we ourselves are living proofs
   of the statement that men shall be blessed in Him. Then, desiring to
   say, in the second place, that we have seen it to be true, also, in
   others. And, thirdly, expressing our conviction that it shall be true,
   on the largest scale, with the nations--"All nations shall be blessed
   in Him," and, therefore, they shall call Him blessed.

   I. First, then, WE OURSELVES ARE LIVING WITNESSES THAT MEN ARE BLESSED
   IN CHRIST. You and I do not pretend to be great sages, famous
   philosophers, or learned divines. We feel when a pin pricks us, or when
   a dog bites us. We have sense enough to know when a thing tastes well
   or bad. We know chalk from cheese, as the proverb has it. We know
   something about our own needs and we also know when we get those needs
   supplied. We have not mastered the extraordinary, but in the
   commonplace we feel at home. A man is none the worse witness in court
   because he does not know all the technical terms used in science. A
   judge is never better pleased than when he sees, in the witness box,
   some plain, blunt, honest fellow who will blunder out the truth. We
   will speak the Truth of God at this time, so far as we know it, whether
   we offend or please. Every man is to speak as he finds and we will
   speak concerning Jesus Christ as we have found Him. I will try, if I
   can, to be spokesman for all present who are believers in Christ. And I
   ask a patient hearing.

   We bear witness that we have been blessed in Him. How much, how deeply,
   how long and in how many ways we have been blessed in Him, I will not
   undertake to say, but this I will say most emphatically--for many of
   you now present, whose lives and histories I know almost as I know my
   own, we have in verity, beyond all question, been blessed in Jesus to
   the highest degree and of this we are sure! We believe and faith grasps
   the first blessing--that we have received a great blessing in Christ by
   the removal of a curse which otherwise must have rested upon us. That
   curse did overshadow us, once, for it is written, "Cursed is everyone
   that continues not in all things which are written in the Book of the
   Law to do them." We could not keep the Law. We did not keep it. We gave
   up all hope of keeping it. Therefore, the dark thundercloud of that
   tremendous sentence hung over us and we heard the voice of justice
   speaking out of it, like a volley of the dread artillery of God in the
   day of tempest! The thunder of the curse rolled heavily over our heads
   and hearts. How some of us cowered down and trembled!

   We can never forget the horror of our soul under the near apprehension
   of Divine wrath! To be cursed of God meant all woes in one. Some of us
   were brought very low, indeed, by the frown of a guilty conscience. We
   gave up, even, the dream of hope. We thought ourselves effectually,
   finally and everlastingly condemned and so, indeed, we should have
   found it, had there not been a Divine Interposer! But now that curse is
   taken from us and we do not dread its return, for He was made a curse
   for us, of whose name we are speaking now--even He "who knew no sin,
   but was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God
   in Him." No curse now remains--only blessing abides! Hallelujah! If our
   Lord had done nothing else for us but the rolling away of the curse, He
   would have blessed us infinitely--and we would have blessed Him
   forever. If He had accomplished nothing but the bearing away of our sin
   into the wilderness--as the scapegoat of old bore away the iniquity of
   Israel--He would have done enough to set our tongues forever praising
   Him. He has lifted from the world the weight of the eternal curse and,
   therefore, let all the bells of our cities ring out His honor and all
   the voices of the villages sing forth His praise! O you stars of light,
   shine to His Glory, for He is blessed beyond all earthly measure!

   The negative being removed, we have had a positive actual experience of
   blessing, for God has blessed us in Christ Jesus and we know that none
   are more blessed than we are. We are not at all, now, the men that we
   used to be as to our inward feelings. Some years ago, under the
   apprehension of Divine wrath, we were so unhappy and troubled that we
   could find no rest. But now we are blessed in Christ so greatly that we
   are at perfect peace and our soul has dropped its anchor in the haven
   of content! Our joy is usually as great as formerly our sorrow used to
   be. We feared our sorrow would kill us--we sometimes think, now, that
   our joy is more likely to do so, for it becomes so intense that at
   times we can scarcely bear it, much less speak of it!

   As we could get no rest before, so now, by faith, we feel as if we
   never lost that rest, for we are so quiet of heart, so calm, so
   settled, that we sing, "My heart is fixed, O God; my heart is fixed!"
   Not because temporal circumstances are quite as we would wish them, but
   because we have learned to leave off wishing, we are now more than
   satisfied! Getting

   God's blessing upon everything, we have learned to be content and
   something more--we joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ. We used to
   fret, before we knew Him, but His love has ended that. We thought we
   could do things better than God could and we did not like His way of
   managing--but He has taught us to be like children, pleased with
   whatever our Father provides--and, therefore, we joyfully declare, "My
   soul is even as a weaned child! I have nothing to wish for. I need
   nothing but what my Father pleases to give me." Having God's sweet
   love, we would not give a snap of the finger for all that princes call
   their treasure, or all that great men reckon to be their honor. Unto us
   who believe, Christ is precious--both treasure and honor in one! In
   fact, Christ is ALL! It is a delightful calm of mind which the Believer
   enjoys when He dwells in Christ.

   Humble faith puts the soul into the guardian hand of the Redeemer and
   leaves it there in the restfulness of entire trust. Grace baptizes us
   into blessedness. It plunges us into that sea of everlasting rest in
   which we hope, forever, to bathe our weary souls. Yes, blessed be His
   name, the Lord Jesus has made life worth living! It is no longer,
   "something better not to be." We must speak well of the condition into
   which He has introduced us since we have known His name. "Well, Jack,
   old fellow," said one who met a man who had lately joined the Church,
   "I hear you have given up all your pleasures." "No, no," said Jack,
   "the fact lies the other way. I have just found all my pleasures and I
   have only given up my follies." Every Christian man and women can
   confirm that way of putting it! We who have believed in Jesus have lost
   no real pleasures, but we have gained immensely in that direction. If
   anything sinful was once a pleasure to us, it is not so now--when we
   discovered it to be evil, it ceased to be pleasure--and we thrust it
   away without regret! We have lost nothing by conversion that was worth
   the keeping, but what we gained by coming to Christ has been an
   inconceivable recompense to us. Is it not so, Brothers and Sisters? Are
   we not blessed in Christ?

   Now, there are some of us who, if we were asked to tell what blessings
   we have received from Christ, would scarcely know where to begin--and
   when we had once begun--we would never leave off unless it were from
   sheer lack of time or strength. Brethren, certain of us owe all that we
   have to the influence of the Lord Jesus. From our birth and childhood
   we were indebted to the Lord Jesus Christ. Some of us now present had
   the great happiness to spring from godly parents-- before we knew the
   meaning of language, that softly sweet name of Jesus Christ was sung in
   our ears! The kindness that we received in our earliest days was, very
   much of it, due to, "Gentle Jesus," of whom our mothers taught us to
   sing! He found for us the first swaddling bands of love and watched
   over our first sleep. Ah, those poor children of the back
   streets--children who are trained in infamy and blasphemy--how sad
   their start in life! But some of us had great advantages which were
   granted us of Sovereign Grace by His dear pierced hands! We bless the
   Lord who saved our parents and, through saving them, sent to our
   trembling infancy a mine and a mint of blessing.

   In our opening childhood we began to understand for ourselves the
   loving influence of an affectionate and anxious mother. And then golden
   showers of Divine Grace fell on us from the love of Jesus. We remember,
   some of us, those hours on the Sabbath, when Mother would talk with us
   of heavenly things--with tears in her eyes persuading her boy to give
   his heart to Jesus, early, and not to let his first days be spent in
   sin. We remember a wise and prudent father, whose example and
   instruction all went the same way. The comforts of our home--and they
   were many--we owed them all to Jesus, for His love made our parents
   what they were and created a holy, happy atmosphere around us! He might
   have left our father to frequent the drunkard's haunt and might have
   suffered our mother to be what many mothers are--unworthy of the
   name--and then our childhood would have been utter wretchedness and our
   home the nursery of vice. Education in crime might have been ours--we
   might have been tutored for the gallows.

   Since that, we have had to shift for ourselves and have left the
   parental roof, but I, for one, have been casting my thoughts back, to
   see if I could remember any good thing that I have which I do not owe
   to the Lord Jesus Christ. I do not know that I have anything that I
   cannot distinctly trace to Him and His influence! I have many Christian
   friends-- most valuable friends, I find them--but my association with
   them commenced in the House of God and the friendship between us has
   been cemented by common service yielded to our blessed Master! Many of
   you would hardly have had a friend in the world if it had not been that
   Jesus introduced you to His disciples--and they have been the best
   friends you have ever had, or ever will have! You used to know certain
   fine fellows who called themselves your friends and as long as you had
   a shilling to bless yourself with, they stuck to you to have sixpence
   of it. You know the style of their friendship and you must now have
   serious doubts as to its value.

   Well, they left you when you became Christians and their departure has
   been a very gainful loss to you! When they cleared out, altogether, you
   found that their removal was for your good, if not for their own. But
   those friends you have made in Christ have been really helpful to you.
   They have deeply sympathized with you and, as far as they could, they
   have helped you. Many have been carried through sharp trials by the
   help of Christian hands. But, whatever you may have to say on the
   point, I am personally a debtor, over head and ears, to my Savior. What
   is there--I repeat the question--that I do not owe to Jesus? I am again
   and again thinking, and thinking, and thinking--but if anything which I
   call my own is worth having, I must trace it to Him. And are you not,
   dear Friends, many of you, compelled to say the same? Among the best
   things you have are your Sabbaths--but they are His days--His
   resurrection days. Your Bible, too, is a priceless treasure, but that
   is His Testament--His legacy of love! The Mercy Seat is a storehouse of
   wealth--but He is that Mercy Seat, and His own blood is sprinkled on
   it! You have nothing, dear Friend, that you do not owe to Jesus, the
   Fountain of salvation. You are blessed in Him!

   I might single out another class of persons, who, from quite another
   point of view, would be compelled to say that they, also, have been
   blessed in Christ. They started in another way and were upon a road
   which led to death, but they have been rescued. Some of you started
   life in the midst of an entirely worldly family. There was
   kindness--parental kindness, in the home, but it was unwise. Abundance
   of temporal enjoyment was always supplied, but there was a very scanty
   recognition of anything like religion and, indeed, no knowledge
   whatever of personal piety. It is little wonder that young persons who
   are trained in a godless manner and allowed to do very much as they
   like, should plunge into this sin, and into that. That some young men
   are saved is a special miracle, for their circumstances make their ruin
   almost inevitable. I am addressing some of my Christian Brothers and
   Sisters who remember what liberty to sin was and how they availed
   themselves of it. They took large license to destroy themselves under
   the pretence of seeing the world. They were never content except when
   they were gratifying their passions and obeying the commands of the
   devil. In their salvation they have been blessed, indeed!

   But you, also, who have gone to no great extent in open sin, you, also,
   have been signally blessed in Christ by gracious and unmistakable
   conversion. In receiving the Lord Jesus into your soul, what a change
   has been made! From what a bondage have you been rescued! Into what a
   new life have you been brought! What new scenes now open up before you!
   What new hopes, what new joys, what new prospects are all your own! Do
   I speak to some who plunged into the very grossest sin and yet can say,
   "But we are washed, but we are sanctified"? Blessed be our dear
   Master's name for Grace to such individuals! Such, indeed, are blessed
   in Him. I know that I am addressing those who had, in their earliest
   days, the very worst example--who have been brought into the House of
   God from the place where Satan's seat is--who cannot, after years of
   godliness, get out of their memory the recollection of the bad,
   depraved old times of their youth. In your salvation Jesus has worked a
   blessed deed. You could drink as others drank. You could fall into sins
   of uncleanness as others did.

   Let us say very little about these open evils. I do not like to hear
   men talk about their old sins as if they were adven-tures--they are a
   shame and a sorrow to all right-minded persons. We humbly hint at them
   to the praise of the Glory of His Grace, for great Grace it was in the
   case of some of us. Oh, but the day in which you first knew that dear
   name! When you first felt repentance melting your hard heart! When you
   first felt hope springing up in your formerly insensible spirit--then
   you began to see that there was something nobler and better to live for
   than merely to gratify sensual passions. Then you began to see that you
   were an immortal spirit and not meant to fatten like the swine, but
   were created to be a brother of the angels and to be akin to God,
   Himself--that was a happy day--a day written in Heaven and made bright
   with the light of seven days! When Jesus changed your nature, forgave
   your sins and made you to be like Himself, you were, indeed, blessed in
   Him!

   I want you now, to look back again. I ought not to tire you, even if my
   talk should seem dull and commonplace, because to remember what God has
   given and to be grateful concerning it, ought to be a sweet pastime to
   each one of us. It is not only a duty, but a recreation to be grateful!
   I do not know any emotion which can give greater joy than that of
   thankfulness to the Most High. Dear Friends, the Lord has greatly
   blessed us in the name of Jesus in times of very special trouble. I may
   not be able to describe your personal trial, but I will take one as a
   specimen. Depression of spirits comes upon the man. He scarcely knows
   how or why, but his soul melts because of heaviness. There is, at the
   back of his sadness, probably some real trial--this he is very apt to
   magnify and make more of than needs be--and also to expect a dark and

   terrible calamity to come which will not come. But yet the foreboding
   is as real a trial as if the catastrophe had actually occurred. The
   poor despondent creature cannot endure himself and almost grows weary
   of life. Like the king of Israel, who had all that heart could
   wish--gardens, palaces, singing men and women--who had all the
   appurtenances, both of folly and of wisdom, to make him happy, yet he
   cries, "Vanity of vanities; all is vanity!" Nothing will cheer this
   child of grief--he is downcast and desolate.

   If you have ever gone through that experience, it has been a very great
   delight to you when you have got alone and thought of your Lord Jesus,
   whose everlasting love cannot cease towards you, whose fullness of
   Grace cannot be exhausted, whose power and faithfulness will always
   stand you in good stead. If, by a sort of desperate resolve, you have
   cast yourself upon Him, to sink or swim, to find everything in Him, or
   else to have nothing, you have risen up altogether a new man! You have
   felt, "I can face the adversary. I can meet the trial, for Jesus is
   mine!" Despair of spirit has fled when you have leaned hard on the
   Cross-Bearer. I have been one of the cave dwellers and the dark has
   shut me in, but Jesus has been my Heaven below. I may have a degree of
   heaviness about me, but still, I trust in the Lord, and I am not
   afraid, for the name of Jesus has caused me to be strong! Yes, men
   shall be "blessed in Him" by the strength which He gives in the hour of
   need.

   You remember the loss of that dear little child. How blessed you were
   in Jesus when He came and solaced you! You remember your father's
   death, or the loss of your husband, or the death of the dearest earthly
   friend. Yes, then in such times you knew how precious Christ could be
   and how blessed you were in Him! Some of you have passed through the
   desert of poverty. You have frequently been very hard pressed, but
   still, though you cannot tell how, you have had just enough. You are
   yet alive though death seemed certain. You have been "blessed in Him,"
   and so you have survived every storm. Some of you have had little
   enough of earthly comfort and yet you have not been unhappy. I have
   sometimes admired a dog for his economical use of comforts. When it has
   been a long, rainy day and the sun has just peeped out and there has
   been a gleam of sunlight on the floor--I have seen him get up and wag
   his tail--and shift his quarters so as to lie down where the bit of
   sunshine was! It is a fine thing to have just that state of mind--never
   to go sullenly into the shadow, but always cheerfully to accept the
   square yard of sunshine and make the most of it! There is something,
   after all, to be thankful for--something for which to praise the name
   of God. And if the Lord Jesus Christ had taught us nothing else but
   that--the practice of lying down wherever there is a trace of sunshine
   and, better still, of always finding sunshine in His dear name--I am
   sure we are bound to say that we have been "blessed in Him."

   Well, every year will teach us more and more fully how blessed we are
   in Jesus, and there will come a day--the last of our earthly days--when
   we shall know on a higher scale how blessed we are in Him! One of the
   most pleasant scenes that I ever see is the dying bed of a fine old
   Christian. I saw one but a few days ago, who, since I was at his
   bedside, has entered into rest. It was very pleasant to talk with him
   about what the Lord had done. He was ready to speak well of the dear
   name. There was much self-depreciation, but much more honoring of
   Christ by testimony concerning support given in the hour of affliction
   and succor in the time of need. Brothers and Sisters, you think it will
   be hard to die? You may not find it so. One, when he was dying, said,
   "Is this dying? Why, it is worthwhile going through all the troubles of
   life, even for death's own sake, if it is like this, for I have such
   heavenly enjoyment as I never could have imagined." Some of God's
   saints are very needlessly anxious about dying. I knew one to whom it
   was always a burden. He went to bed one night and he never woke
   up--thus answering his own fears, for he did not even know when he
   passed away, but died in his sleep! He was gone, gone, gone to Heaven
   without a pang! When you see how Believers pass away to be with their
   Lord in Glory, you have a commentary upon the words of my text--"Men
   shall be blessed in Him."

   But do you see them? Their spirits have ascended unto God, their
   Father. How full of bliss they are! Disembodied they are, but they are
   not destroyed. Their poor earthly frames are still in the grave, yet
   their liberated spirits are supremely blessed, for they are, "forever
   with the Lord" and they are blessed in Him. Wait you but a very little
   while and the trumpet shall ring out from the angel's mouth, "Awake,
   you dead, and come to judgement!" And then shall men be blessed in Him,
   if they are, indeed, "in Him." When the righteous, restored to their
   bodies, shall, in their perfect manhood, behold Him face to face and
   dwell with Him, world without end, "men shall be blessed in Him."

   I do not feel satisfied with the style of my speech at this time, but
   we who speak the Word are by no means masters of ourselves. I cannot
   rise to the height of this great argument and I do not think that, if I
   were to try a hundred times, I could ever satisfy myself when speaking
   upon this most Divine theme. My Lord is the most blessed Master that
   ever a ser-

   vant had and He has blessed me personally so unspeakably that, if I
   were to bear my witness with the tongues of orators and angels by the
   space of a century, yet must I cease from the task and humbly
   confess--"I have not told you the half-- nor can I tell you even the
   tenth of how good my Well-Beloved is to me." I suspect that you are,
   most of you, of my mind and say, "Neither can we." I sometimes tell you
   the story of what happened to me when I declared, in a sermon, that in
   the Heaven of the grateful, I would sing the loudest of them all,
   because I owed more to the Grace of God than anybody else. I meant it
   not out of any sense of superiority, but rather of inferiority. One
   good old soul, when I came down the pulpit stairs, remarked to me, "You
   have made a great mistake in your sermon." I answered, "No doubt I made
   a dozen." "No, but," she said, "the great mistake was this--you said
   that you owed more to God than anybody else, but you do not owe
   anything like so much as I do. I have had more Grace from Him than you
   have. I have been a bigger sinner than you ever were. I shall sing the
   loudest!"

   "Well, well," I thought, "I will not quarrel with her; it shall make me
   the more glad to find myself outdone." I found that all the Christians
   were much of the same mind. Brothers and Sisters, we will have it out
   when we get up yonder. But you shall praise God, indeed, if you praise
   Him more than I will--and you must be double debtors to my Lord if you
   owe Him more than I do! If you are more unworthy and more undeserving
   than I am, you must, indeed, be unworthy and undeserving! And if His
   rich, free, Sovereign Grace has exhibited itself more fully in you than
   it has in unworthy me, it has, indeed, overflowed all its banks! We
   will leave the loving contest for the present, but when all the birds
   of Paradise reach their nests above, there shall be a competition of
   adoring praise--and all of us will do our best to bless the name of the
   Lord!

   II. Our second head was to be a practical one--we can only give a few
   minutes to it. WE HAVE SEEN OTHER MEN BLESSED IN CHRIST. Our
   observation confirms our experience. If this were the proper time, I
   could narrate many instances--which I could also confirm by producing
   the individuals--in which men have been remarkably blessed in Christ.
   What social changes we have seen in those who have believed in Him!
   They have not been the same persons--in many respects they are new. I
   have known persons at whose houses I have visited--well, you could not
   have believed that the man who lodged in the house, where he was first
   found, could ever have risen to occupy a room in a house at all like
   that in which he came to reside! The room in which I conversed with him
   was a palace, compared to the dog-hole in which he once existed. There
   was a change in his dwelling. There was a change in his wife. You would
   hardly know the woman--she is so different from the wretched slut and
   slave who called him, "husband," with a sigh and a sneer! She is here,
   now, sitting with him, and they are as happy as angels! I shall not
   point them out, but they are as good as any of you. We have known the
   case in which, from rags--absolute rags--the coming of Christ into the
   soul has lifted a man into competence, respectability and position.

   Godliness has a gain about it--an honest, worthy gain for the life
   which now is. It teaches men habits of thrift, prudence and
   temperance--and delivers them from the thralldom of drunkenness and
   other vices--by which the major part of poverty is occasioned. It is
   worth mentioning even such blessings as these, as the poor little
   children know. They used to run away when Father came in, for they were
   afraid of him, but now, instead of that, they are watching for the time
   when his work is done, to go toddling down the street to meet dear
   Father, for the luxury of being brought home in his arms! Our Lord
   Jesus Christ has blessed some men and some women at such a rate that
   the devil, himself, would not have the impudence to say it was not a
   blessing! Liar as Satan is, he could not deny that godliness has
   brought sunshine where there was none--the blessing has been too
   distinct and manifest for any to deny it!

   What a moral change have we seen in some! They could not speak without
   an oath, but the habit of profane swearing ended in a minute and they
   have never been tempted to it since! Rash, bad-tempered men, who would
   break up the furniture of the house in their passion, have become as
   gentle as lambs! Such furies usually become quiet, peaceable and
   long-suffering--Divine Grace has a marvelous influence upon the temper!
   Men of hot passions that used to give a word and a blow--but generally
   the blow, first--now watch themselves and guard against their
   infirmity! They take a little time to think before they let fly a hard
   word or give a sharp look. The change that we have seen in some men has
   been as complete as that which could have been worked by that fabled
   mill, into which the legend says that they put old men, turned the
   handle and ground them young again! Truly a far greater renovation is
   worked in mind and heart where Jesus comes. Men are "blessed in Him"!

   Then, as to mental blessing. What have we seen? This have I seen--here
   is one case out of many. A young man who had fallen into sin, came to
   me in deep despair of mind. He was so desponding that his very face
   bore witness to his misery. He wore the aspect of one who could not
   live much longer as he then was. I had tried to set the Gospel clearly
   before him on the previous Sabbath, but he told me that he could not
   grasp it, for that by his sin he had reduced his mind to such a state
   that he felt himself to be little better than an idiot. He was not
   speaking nonsense, either, for there are vices which destroy the
   intellect. I told him that Jesus Christ could save idiots--that even if
   his mind was, in measure, impaired as the result of sin, yet there was
   quite enough mind left to be made glad with a sense of pardon, seeing
   there was more than enough to make him heavy with a sense of guilt. I
   cheered that Brother as best I could, but I could effect nothing by my
   own efforts. Soon the Lord Jesus Christ came to him--and he is now a
   happy, earnest, joyful Christian! Not long ago he sent an offering of
   thanksgiving to God for having lifted him up from the deeps into which
   he had fallen. I hope there is a long life of real usefulness before
   him.

   We cannot mention one tenth of what we personally know! Eternity will
   open a great book of record. I call upon the spirits of the just made
   perfect to witness what the Grace of God did for them! I call upon
   parents, here, to tell the pleasing story of the conversion of their
   sons and daughters! And I call upon those who watch for their fellow
   men to say whether they have not met with many cases in which men have
   been blessed in Jesus by being snatched from between the jaws of
   madness, itself, by the sweet, calming influence of the always dear and
   blessed name of our Redeemer! Yes, indeed, and of a truth, men are and
   shall be blessed in Him!

   The practical point is, Brothers and Sisters, since we need to do good,
   let us preach up our Lord Jesus Christ as the Sovereign balm for every
   sinner's wound! If you want to be philanthropists, be Christians! If
   you would bless your fellow men with the best of all blessings, convey
   to them the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Do not believe that there is
   anything you can do for your children which will be more effectual than
   teaching them about Jesus! Do not think that anything in the workshop
   can soften the vulgarities, silence the blasphemies and end the
   profanities of your fellow workmen, like setting Jesus Christ before
   them! When the Moravian missionaries first went to Greenland, they
   tried to tell the Greenlanders about the existence of a God--they spent
   some months in such preliminary subjects before they came to the
   Gospel--but they never gained the attention of the people. Discourses
   upon such necessary subjects as the Godhead, the immortality of the
   soul and the like, were flavorless to the Greenlanders.

   It happened, one day, that one of the missionaries, translating the
   Gospel according to John, read out these words-- "God so loved the
   world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him
   should not perish, but have everlasting life." "What is that?" said the
   Greenlanders. "What is that? We never heard the likes of that. Why have
   you not told us that before?" Nothing had been done till the
   missionaries came to the Gospel, itself! Then they reached the
   Greenlander's heart--awakened his dormant intellect and led him to
   Jesus! Oh, let us keep on with the subject of Christ Crucified!
   Whatever there is not in our shop window, let us always have Christ as
   the chief article of our heavenly commerce. Whatever there may lack of
   Grace and beauty in our speech, and our outward appearance, may there
   be no lack of Jesus Christ set forth among the sons of men, for, "men
   shall be blessed in Him" and not without Him! Great schemes of
   socialism have been tried and found lacking--let us look to
   regeneration by the Son of God--and we shall not look in vain. Nothing
   has come of newfangled preaching from the first day till now--but never
   has the old faith of Jesus failed! Men have been blessed in Jesus and
   they shall be blessed in Him as long as the race shall exist.

   III. Lastly, this whole matter is to extend till THE ENTIRE WORLD SHALL
   BE BLESSED IN CHRIST. Even at

   this moment the whole world is the better for Christ. But where He is
   best known and loved, there is He the greatest blessing. What snatched
   many an island of the southern sea from barbarism and cannibalism?
   What, but Jesus Christ preached among them? Men have been blessed in
   Him in Europe, America, Asia and everywhere. Africa and other lands,
   still plunged in barbarism, shall receive light from no other source
   but that from which our fathers received it centuries ago--from the
   great Sun of Righteousness.

   Men shall be blessed in Christ because where He comes, oppression
   cannot live. You may tell me that the governor of such an empire is a
   despot. Oh, yes, but despots cannot long flourish where there is an
   open Bible! Tyrannies may last a generation or two, but all the world
   knows that their time is short. They will go down--they must go down
   where Christ is lifted up! That Inspired Book is a testimony for human
   liberty, louder than all others. It is a declaration of the rights of
   men under King Jesus--despotism must fall before it, sooner or later.
   We, in this country, owe our liberties,

   beyond everything, to the Christianity which is the outflow of a
   present Christ among us. Slavery? What a plague it was upon the fair
   hands of our sister nation across the Atlantic! The spot is washed away
   and it was true religion which forced the washing! There would have
   been no freeing of the slaves from fetters if it had not been for the
   Christianity which, after long silence, at last spoke out! And when it
   spoke, it was as when a lion roars.

   The Christianity of England is always pleading for the slave, for the
   aborigine, for the down-trodden. Leave our politicians alone and we
   shall soon have all the infamies alive again! Slavery would be
   tolerated, if not encouraged, if there were not Christian souls upon
   the watch. What saves us from war at this moment? What influence is it
   that is always contrary to war and always cries for peace? Why, it is
   the Christian element among us which counts anything better than
   bloodshed! Let the Christian element spread and it will be a power to
   bless mankind! It shall, in proportion as it spreads, put down evil and
   foster good. Already many a monopoly has been ended and many a liberty
   has been gained. Much religious intolerance has been subdued by the
   power of Jesus Christ over His people and I do pray, dear Friends, that
   we may live to see all nations more manifestly affected by the Gospel
   of Jesus Christ. May every nation be ruled by just and righteous laws!
   May every nation be willing to submit exterior disputes to the
   arbitration of justice!

   It will be so one day. The nations shall be friends and all men shall
   feel that they are members of one great family. "Do unto others as you
   would that they should do to you," is the sum of the moral teaching of
   our Divine Lord--and if that is followed, it will bring about a halcyon
   era, the likes of which the world has never seen! If His Spirit will
   come and renew men's hearts--and teach them to love and to obey the
   Lord their God--then shall all nations call the Redeemer, blessed and,
   from every corner of the whole earth, the song shall go up, "Blessing,
   and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sits upon the Throne,
   and unto the Lamb forever and ever!" Amen.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 21, 1890.

   "For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in
   the land, the wilderness has shut them in." Exodus 14:3.

   ISRAEL was clean escaped from Egypt. Not a hoof of their cattle was
   left behind, nor foot of child or aged man remained in the house of
   bondage. But though they were gone, they were not forgotten by the
   tyrant who had enslaved them. They had been a very useful body of
   workers, for they had built treasure cities and storehouses for
   Pharaoh. Compelled to work without wages, they cost the tyrant nothing
   but the expenditure of the lash. His exactions of forced labor had
   grown intolerable to the people, but the buildings erected had been a
   joy to the lord of Egypt. When they were quite gone, Pharaoh woke up to
   a sense of his loss and his attendants felt the same. So they cried,
   "Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
   Then they resolved to drive them back, again, and they thought it easy
   to do so, for they said, "They are entangled in the land, the
   wilderness has shut them in." They knew that the Israelites had no
   spirit for war and they felt sure that they had only to overtake them
   and hurry them back like a drove of cattle. They had found them such
   submissive servants that they expected to fit their fetters on them,
   again, and rivet them forever. Perhaps their God had shot His last
   arrow and Egypt might capture His people, again, without fear of
   plagues. Thus men thought--but the Lord thought otherwise.

   Do not I speak to some at this hour who, during the last few months,
   have, by the power of the Lord's gracious hand, escaped out of the
   bondage of sin? You have got clean away from your old master. With a
   high hand and an outstretched arm has God brought you forth into
   liberty! You remember the sprinkling of the blood and the eating of the
   Paschal Lamb--and you are now on your way to Canaan. But your former
   master and his friends have not forgotten you. You were once a valuable
   servant to Satan and he will not willingly lose you. Some of you whom
   God has saved by Grace could drink for Satan, lie for him, swear for
   him, lead others into evil ways and you could do other things,
   cheerfully, which I need not mention, which he always desires to have
   done in his kingdom. You were a trained servant and knew your master's
   way so as to answer his purpose better than most. Servants of Satan
   usually serve him greedily and you were very eager. Nothing is too hot
   or too heavy for men who are thoroughly enthusiastic for evil. Sins
   that should be thought degrading are followed by men under the notion
   of pleasure and gaiety. "A short life and a merry one," is too often
   the cry of persons who are preferring death to life.

   The devil has the knack of making his bondsmen boast of their freedom
   and they follow with eagerness that which is to their own loss and
   ruin. Poor slaves! Their slavery has blinded their minds. Thanks be
   unto God, certain of you have lately fled from your former bondage! But
   the point I am to speak of is this--the great tyrant has not forgotten
   you and he designs in his heart your capture and re-enslavement. He and
   his are continually looking for opportunities by which they may bring
   you back into the thralldom of evil, fasten the manacles of habit upon
   your hands and fit the fetters of despair upon your feet. By the Grace
   of God I hope that the Prince of Evil and his helpers will be
   disappointed, but they will leave no stone unturned to effect their
   purposes. One of their hopes of driving you back is the belief that you
   are entangled by your circumstances and surroundings. They conceive
   that you have got into serious difficulty through your conversion and
   that you cannot find your way out of your perplexity. Now the enemy
   says, "I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil." The
   Pharaoh of the infernal regions thinks to drive the fugitives back,
   again, like a flock of sheep and, notwithstanding all that God has done
   for them, he hopes, again, to bring them under his yoke. If Jehovah has

   brought you out, His work will never be undone, but the enemy's hope
   lies in his belief that you are hopelessly entangled by your present
   environment.

   I speak, just now, mainly to new converts, and I trust I may encourage
   them. Satan has less hope of getting back those who have escaped from
   his tyranny for many years. If he can trip them up or worry them, even
   now, he will take a delight in doing it, but he begins to see that the
   older pilgrims are really the Lord's and cannot fall into his hands. Of
   those who have only lately escaped from his power, he has greater hope,
   for they have not yet proven, by the test of experience, that the work
   within them is Divine. He hopes that possibly theirs is only temporary
   reformation and, if so, he can soon make them slip back into the mire
   of sin from which he hopes they have only half escaped. I am going to
   speak to the raw recruits, "from Egypt lately come," hoping that, by
   the blessing of the Holy Spirit, they may be cheered in pressing
   forward and may feel that they can never go back to their old sins.

   The early period of Christian faith, like the infancy of life, is
   crowded with dangers. Literally, new-born life is so precarious that it
   is a wonder that any infant survives! Infant spiritual life is so full
   of weaknesses and diseases that none would survive were it not for
   Almighty Grace. Hence the need of the special precept, "Feed my lambs."
   It is our bounden duty to look well after beginners in the ways of God.
   The moral mortality in our Churches is mainly among the new converts.
   If they survive the first years of temptation, as a rule they continue
   with us. Our Church Roll shows that the leakage is through the
   unseasoned timbers--

   "When they have conquered early fears,

   And vanquished youthful wrong,

   Grace will preserve their following years,

   And make their virtues strong." If we leave them without help and
   comfort in their beginnings, we cannot tell how much they will sin and
   suffer. With the view of helping them, I shall speak, first, upon one
   of our early dangers and, secondly, upon our security against that
   danger.

   I. ONE OF OUR EARLY DANGERS is this--we may become entangled in the
   land--the wilderness may shut us in. That entanglement takes a great
   many shapes. I will only hint at a few of them.

   Dealing with old friends is a frequent one. The man is a new creature
   in Christ Jesus and since his friends find that he is so, they trouble
   him. His foes are they of his own household! How is the youth to make
   an open confession of Christ before his infidel father? Possibly the
   convert is a wife. How is she to be a Christian if she is married to an
   ungodly husband? Our earthly loves have great power over us and it is
   right that they should--but herein comes a hindrance to spiritual life.
   Satan says to himself, "Ah, he cannot break away from my kingdom, for
   his brother, his wife, or his betrothed will keep him in my service!"
   It may not only be one member of the family, but several may combine to
   draw back the half-escaped one. It may be that parents, brothers,
   sisters, friends of all sorts will unite in their efforts to jeer the
   young Christian out of his faith and lead him off from the road of
   uprightness. We hear much of the Salvation Army, but, alas, there is an
   Army of Damnation, too! Very zealous and crafty are these followers of
   the Evil One. Cruel mockings, accusations of hypocrisy, slanders and
   unkindnesses are not spared, to turn the young Christian from the right
   way. Because of household opposition, Satan says, "He is entangled in
   the land." The adversary thinks that you have not the courage to stand
   up against your relatives and you will not dare to confess your Lord
   before your wife, or your father. We shall now see whether the Lord has
   brought you out, or whether you are running off on a mere whim of your
   own--the devil will not be slow to apply the test!

   In some cases the entanglement is not so much that of the family as of
   society. I have personally known one or two friends moving in high
   circles who have said to me, "As soon as I am known to be a Christian,
   my friends will cut my acquaintance. I do not know what I shall do when
   I have to visit at certain houses. Assuredly I shall have to run the
   gauntlet." It has been a quiet pleasure to me when I have found that
   they have been banished from such "society" altogether, for it could
   never have been of any spiritual advantage to them and it might have
   proved a snare. Their loss was a real gain. But, oh, how many are
   afraid of Sir John and of Lady Mary, or of some wealthy neighbor! These
   fine folks may be nothing very great, after all, but, still, weak
   hearts are all too apt to dread the loss of their patronage and are
   ready enough to make a great cross of being frowned out of their
   society.

   In other circles the same difficulties occur. The workshop has its
   trials as well as the drawing room. "Ah," says Satan, "the man came out
   and confessed himself a Christian the other night, but I know where he
   works and there is not a

   man in the place who will sympathize with him! He will be entangled in
   the land." It happens that one begins in the morning with a joke. A
   second comes on with an oath. A third follows suit with a sharp and
   bitter observation. All day long they give the new convert such
   handfuls of mud as they can find--and the hope of the Evil One is that
   thus he will be forced back into his old ways. The same thing happens
   on the farm, or on board ship, or in the barracks--old companions want
   to have our society and are not pleased with the silent rebuke which is
   implied in our separating from them. You know more about this than I
   do, but I wonder not at Satan saying, "They are entangled in the land,
   the wilderness has shut them in." Why, some of you can scarcely descend
   the steps of this Tabernacle, convinced of sin and awakened to seek
   eternal salvation, before an old friend meets you and, by his careless
   salutation, he makes you forget the emotion which just before was so
   manifest! Or if you get over the first attack, you are so warmly
   assailed indoors that you are greatly inclined to give in. Alas for the
   many who are speedily entangled in the nets of human associates and
   never gain the liberty of Christ! The demands of business, of position,
   of self-interest, of custom--these all hold men as birds are caught
   with bird-lime, or as the needle is held by a powerful magnet--and so
   they are prepared to listen to evil entreaties and return to the
   country from which they came out.

   To some, the entanglements come from having to deal with new matters.
   All things have become new and among the rest, even their ordinary
   business wears a different aspect. It used to be conducted in such and
   such a way, but now, on examination, the man says, "I am a Christian. I
   cannot do as I have done and yet, how can I alter it?" It is a very
   simple matter to fall into those ways of trade which are
   questionable--but it is not quite so easy to quit them and to gain a
   livelihood. When you alter one custom of trade, another matter hangs
   upon it, and needs a change. And it is not easy to bring partners,
   clerks and workpeople out of old ways into new. They are very apt to be
   sticklers for former methods. Moreover, there are people in the trade
   who think you more nice than wise and will even refuse to do business
   with you if you are so particular. It is no small thing for the convert
   to set himself right with the world in his changed mode of dealing, yet
   this has got to be done and done with decision, too, or there is no
   escaping from evil! At such a time the struggler feels--"I am entangled
   in the land, the wilderness has shut me in"--and the enemy of souls is
   of the same opinion. Now is his opportunity, but if you escape him,
   now, he will never again have such an advantage over you.

   At the same time, our young Brother may be alarmed about the other side
   of his new associations--namely, joining the Church. It seems an ordeal
   to young beginners to come to see the pastor about uniting with the
   Lord's people. I am sure they need not be at all terrified of me, for
   no one will more heartily welcome any sincere seeker after Jesus! All
   that I shall ask is a simple confession of faith in the Lord Jesus
   Christ--and if that is given, even with fear and trembling--I shall be
   well content. Yet, to the timid beginner, it seems very solemn to be
   spoken to by the Elders of the Church. Mr. Bunyan puts lions in front
   of the Palace Beautiful, by which palace he means the Church. I have
   been told by a facetious person that Mr. Bunyan meant by these lions
   the Deacons and Elders! Well, I can only say that I find them brave as
   lions, but even if they were terrible as those monarchs of the forests,
   there is no just cause for fearing them, for Mr. Bunyan adds, "The
   lions are chained." If any of you are afraid of our Deacons and Elders,
   you are so without reason, for the lions are chained by the intense
   love they bear both to their Lord and to all pilgrims to Zion.

   A guard is set before the door of the Church for a necessary purpose,
   for we would have none enter who are self-deceived--but none of the
   Brothers in office among us will harm anyone who desires to serve the
   Lord and dwell with His people. If you have been troubled about your
   admission to the Church, I hope that fear will come to an end by your
   pushing forward and being enrolled in our ranks. Get right in your
   position, both towards the world and the Church, and let not the Evil
   One say with regard to either of these matters, "They are entangled in
   the land, the wilderness has shut them in."

   We have known others bewildered with doctrinal difficulties. When a
   man's soul is renewed, he begins to think, and he desires to understand
   many things which, before, were indifferent to him. He meets with that
   most plain and precious Truth of God that, "Jesus Christ came into the
   world to save sinners," and he is well satisfied with that declaration.
   Still, as he grows, he seeks more knowledge and longs to understand the
   deep things of God. Possibly, as a young beginner he goes beyond his
   depth. He perceives the Doctrine of Election in the Bible and he asks,
   "What is this?" It may be he is greatly puzzled with this doctrine, for
   though it is rich with comfort for those who, by reason of years, have
   had their senses exercised, yet it is a hard nut for babes in Grace. It
   is simple enough when seen from one side of it, but from another it is
   a bottomless mystery. We have seen minds quite bewildered where, to us,
   all things have seemed plain.

   I have known people stumble over hard texts. "What does this text mean?
   What does that passage mean? What does this other Scripture mean?" You
   would be astonished if you knew how many people are disturbed in mind,
   lie awake at nights and are likely to lose their faith in Christ over
   Scriptures which are as cheering as can be when once they are
   understood! These people need that some man should guide them, for,
   like the Ethiopian nobleman, they will not otherwise understand what
   they read. In former periods, many lost themselves in meditations upon
   free will, predestination, Irresistible Grace and so forth. It was a
   pity that they dwelt so much upon the decrees of the Father and so
   little upon the work of the Lord Jesus! They got their heads muddled by
   things too high for them. People are more frivolous now, as a rule, and
   this evil is rare. Still, there are to be found, here and there,
   thoughtful persons not yet fully instructed in the faith who are
   puzzled and confused as the Infinite Glory of revealed Truth opens up
   before their astonished gaze!

   They will know, hereafter, but for the present they are sorely troubled
   and perplexed--and their cruel enemy rejoices that, "They are entangled
   in the land." Nothing contributes more to this than the divisions in
   the Christian Church. One preacher cries up one thing and another quite
   the contrary, till young converts cry, "Who are we to believe?" And
   they stand as if they had come to crossroads and do not know which way
   to take. I am sorry it should be so, but there is a promise to the
   family of faith, "All your children shall be taught of the Lord." You
   shall not lose your way if you will accept the Word of God as a little
   child. Be of good courage, for it is written--"He shall guide you
   continually."

   Far worse is the case of those who are entangled through strange
   discoveries. They came in among professed Believers and they supposed
   that all Christians were perfect, (which, by the way, is a mere
   supposition), and now they have met with a certain loud professor who
   has acted very dishonorably and unkindly towards them! And they cry out
   with astonishment, "How is this?" We who know by experience and
   observation that Judas may be looked for among common dis-ciples--since
   he appeared among the chosen 12--are not so staggered when we see a
   hypocrite! We expect to see black sheep even in the choicest flock--but
   the new convert is sorely grieved and stumbled when he finds out the
   melancholy fact that all men are not what they seem. Great mischief is
   worked among young Christians by hypocritical or inconsistent
   professors. God grant that none of us may be of that kind, for the
   blood of souls will lie at the door of such persons!

   It may be that, in his earliest days, the young convert finds out with
   surprise that his own heart is brimming over with sin. He thought that
   he was so changed that no sin remained in him and no temptation from
   without could move him. He hoped that he was so sure of the Truth of
   God that he would never doubt. But now he has to cry, "Lord, help my
   unbelief," for he can hardly decide whether he believes or not! He has
   discovered another law in his members warring against the law of his
   mind and bringing him into captivity. He finds that when he would do
   good, evil is present with him--and this inward conflict between the
   flesh and the spirit comes upon him as a terrible surprise. "Why am I
   like this?" he cries. "Can I be a child of God and have such dreadful
   thoughts? Could I feel so wretched if I were, indeed, a possessor of
   Grace?" When young beginners get into this rough road, they are taken
   by surprise and know not what to do. Then is it that the adversary of
   their souls hopes that, "They are entangled in the land, the wilderness
   has shut them

   in."

   Akin to this are their amazements at painful experiences. It may be the
   Lord withholds the light of His Countenance from them and then they
   walk in darkness and see no light. If they were always to enjoy calm
   and comfort, they would, with self-complacency, boast, "My mountain
   stands firm! I shall never be moved!" But the Lord hides Himself from
   them to slay their pride. If they were always at ease, they would fall
   into living by feeling, instead of walking by faith. Therefore the Lord
   tries them, leads them by a desert path, clouds their sky and burdens
   their backs. Then they enquire, "How is this?" Some of us know that
   when God shuts us up in the dark, He loves us as dearly as when He
   pours sunlight upon us, but beginners in the Divine Life do not know
   this--and they are terribly put to it since they judge God's heart by
   His hands. "Can I be a child of God, and yet be so afflicted? And why
   is my light so dim?" These frames and feelings, which come of our being
   frail, foolish and feeble-minded, are a great perplexity--and when we
   cannot make them out, the adversary cries, "They are entangled in the
   land, the wilderness has shut them in."

   What if, at the back of all this, we should be assailed with special
   trials? Suppose it should be true that ever since you have been a
   Christian, you have not prospered in worldly concerns as you did
   before? It will seem strange. When you were a man of the world and were
   an enemy of God, you had plenty of money and a host of friends--but now
   that you have become a Christian, your means and your friends are
   gradually melting away. It may be the case. I have known such

   an instance. Yet it is not hard to explain this in several ways. The
   Lord would not have us follow Him for the sake of what we get from Him.
   He would have us men, against whom even Satan could not say, "Have You
   not set a hedge about him and all that he has?" Our Lord desires
   followers who will cling to Him at all risks, for no other reason but
   their value of Himself and His Truth. He would have servants who,
   having counted the cost, would lose estate and repute, yes, and life,
   itself, sooner than turn aside from the way of their Lord! Perhaps you
   are being educated to this point of faithfulness. Do not, therefore,
   doubt because of your exercises and tribulations. but take these things
   joyfully! The path to Heaven lies by the dens of the leopards and the
   haunts of the young lions. Dream not that God has forsaken you! Leave
   it to the devil to say, "They are entangled in the land, the wilderness
   has shut them in."

   Possibly, once more, some may be much beset on the road to Heaven by
   mental difficulties. I do not often say much about these things because
   there are plenty of preachers who, by mentioning difficulties, are
   really spreading them. Certain clever gentlemen of the cloth may think
   it their duty to sow doubts among their hearers, but I have no such
   ambition. They may imagine that they are answering the questions which
   they suggest, but it seems to me that they are merely advertising them
   to many of those who were previously unaware of them. This is an age
   when men assail the Inspiration of the Bible, the atoning Sacrifice and
   the Election of Grace. I need not enlarge. Everything is now attacked.
   There is no part of the Bible which some critic would not take away
   from us. It may be, young Friend, that you cannot answer all the
   objections which you hear. Do not wonder if you cannot! You would be
   wiser than Solomon if you could reply to all objections that quibblers
   may invent!

   A friend came to me with a great difficulty, supposing that I could
   answer it off-hand; but I replied, "He who fashioned this piece of
   criticism took time in the making of it and you must allow me the same
   time to demolish it. I will do my best with it, but remember, if you
   find a thousand difficulties which I cannot meet, that fact will not
   prove that they cannot be met, for I do not profess to be Omniscient,
   nor do I assert that faith is a Grace which has no difficulties to
   surmount." If there were a thousand more objections which could not, at
   this present time, be answered, they might confuse our feeble minds,
   but they would not shake the eternal Truth of God, itself! God's Word
   is sure, be the difficulties what they may! Know what you know and
   believe what you believe--and get a firm grip of undoubted Truths of
   God--and though, when you are worried with the doubts and hypotheses of
   philosophers and the like, Satan will say, "They are entangled in the
   land," let him see that your worry is soon ended by a childlike faith
   in the living God! Real faith will find a way out of perplexity, or
   will make one! True faith will sooner set aside the conclusions of
   human reason than the declarations of God. In fact, faith teaches
   reason to be reasonable by setting before it the highest of all
   reasons, namely, the Testimony of God! God send us such a childlike
   faith and then we shall not be "entangled in the land"!

   II. I have thus shown you what our danger is. Now, secondly, let us
   think of OUR SECURITY UNDER THIS

   TRIAL.

   My text is, "Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
   entangled in the land, the wilderness has shut them in." Upon this I
   make the first observation, that this is not true. It is only what
   Pharaoh said. And so when Satan says, "They are entangled in the land,"
   it is not true! It is only one of the sayings of the Father of Lies.
   "They say"--says one. Well, what do they say? Let them say it--their
   saying it will not make it true. A troubled one comes to me and
   complains of a certain charge which has been made. And he adds, as the
   sharp edge of it all, "Sir, it is not true." Well, then, do not fret
   about it! One cries out, "They are taking away my character and I feel
   it keenly because what they say is cruelly false." Friend, do not feel
   it at all! You ought to feel it only if what they say is true.

   Now, what Pharaoh said was not true and his speech did not cause the
   children of Israel to be really entangled in the land. Pharaoh's tongue
   speaks his wish--but his wish will not be realized. Our adversaries say
   that our cause is defeated. Is it? "Ah," they say, "we have shut him
   up. The man cannot answer us! We have crushed his faith and argued his
   confidence to death." Have you? By the grace of God we stand fast in
   the once-delivered faith, after all your sophistries and boasts! You
   say that we are entangled, but we are not. "Show us," they say, "the
   way in which you will get out of the wilderness." No, that we cannot
   do, but, if you will wait a while, the Lord will show you--by leading
   us graciously through the divided sea--and, it may be, by also drowning
   you therein, as He did the Egyptians when the waters overwhelmed them!
   Israel could not guess her way, but Israel could wait till God revealed
   it. Newly-emancipated one, you are shut in with doubts and difficulties
   suggested by carnal reason, but, I pray you, believe your God! By the
   blood of the Cross, I entreat you, believe the Lord Jesus! By the
   eternal judgment and the Great White Throne, believe your God.

   "Let God be true but every man a liar." Wait till He shall clear your
   way, through the very heart of the sea if need be--a way which will
   conduct you in safety to the other shore, where, with timbrel and with
   song, you shall proclaim His victory!

   My next observation is this--though Pharaoh said, "They are entangled
   in the land, the wilderness has shut them in," yet they had a Guide.
   Look at the surroundings of my text and you will see that they were
   guided by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, so
   that they had no need to be in any perplexity as to their road. We,
   too, have a Guide. In Providence we are not left without a Leader and
   in spiritual things we are not left without the Spirit of God who shall
   lead us into all Truth. Young traveler, you are not turned out alone
   into a wild wilderness to find a path--the Good Shepherd goes before
   you! Follow Him as the sheep follow their shepherd. He never led His
   flock in the wrong direction yet! Do what He bids you and you are safe.
   Do as He did when He was here below--His example is your safe
   direction. Believe Him and obey Him. Keep to the narrow path. Hold fast
   your integrity and never let go of your faith. You have a heavenly
   Guide. You are not left alone and, therefore, you cannot be entangled
   in the land--the wilderness has not shut you in!

   Remember, next, that the Lord had appointed a way for these people.
   There was not only a Guide, but a way. But where was that way?
   Mountains blocked them on either side. They could not turn back, for
   Pharaoh shut up that route. Where should they go? The reedy Red Sea
   rolled across their front. Listen! Their way is across the bottom of
   that sea and up from its depths to the other shore! A strange path! "It
   is no way at all," cries unbelief. Have you never read, concerning God,
   "Your way is in the sea, and Your path in the great waters, and Your
   footsteps are not known"? Tried Believer, the Lord will make a way for
   you where no foot has ever been! That which, like a sea, threatens to
   drown you, shall be a highway for your escape!

   I once had a friend, an upright gracious man, a gentleman whom God had
   prospered. He had, when engaged in a bank, acted uprightly in a matter
   in which his superiors judged him to be foolishly scrupulous and,
   therefore, dismissed him. He could not do wrong and so he was left with
   a wife and family, without a job and, as everybody told him,
   irretrievably ruined because of his "foolish conscientiousness." He was
   for years the head of that very bank. In a singular way, the Lord made
   his discharge the means of his advancement so that he rose, step by
   step, to be the master where he had been the rejected servant! And
   this, humanly speaking, would not have come about had it not been for
   the incident mentioned. Have faith that God can turn the evil into good
   and that which threatens to annihilate you will be the means of your
   enlargement! Look well to your integrity and the Lord will look to your
   prosperity! The way of faith is not a common turnpike road which every
   careless traveler may traverse without care or study. It is a
   mysterious way which no fowl knows and the lion's whelp has not
   trodden. Those who inherit the special glories of Heaven must encounter
   the special perils of the deep and of the desert--and in their amazing
   journey they shall behold the glorious arm of the Lord working wonders
   for them!

   Note well that the Lord would not only find them a way, but, at the
   same time, overthrow their enemies. You have come up out of Egypt, O
   young Believer, but the taskmasters are at your heels! There may come a
   decisive moment, after which they shall never pursue you again. These
   who seek your soul are to be destroyed, so that there shall not be one
   of them left. I believe that many a young convert hates sin and hates
   all evil habits, but these evils keep dogging his footsteps and seem as
   if they would master him--and then there comes a time of great struggle
   and tremendous battling without and within--on that one desperate field
   he fights the matter out. His adversaries are drowned in that Red Sea!
   His old sins and his old habits lose forever their former power. The
   Red Sea rolled between Israel and Egypt and whatever else might trouble
   the pilgrim host, they were never, throughout the whole 40 years,
   molested by Pharaoh, or any of the Egyptians.

   It is a grand thing when a man gets clean away from the world and is
   reckoned as dead to it. He has burnt his boats and has landed on the
   shore from which he never can go back, again, but must fight out the
   battle against sin even to the end. When a man is sworn into the army
   of Christ for eternity and the world has cast him out, there is nothing
   for him but to go right ahead. Everything that he has is now staked on
   the Cross of Christ. Happy man to have come to such a pass--to be once
   and for all crucified to the world, and the world crucified to him! The
   Egyptians of sin which had so fiercely pursued him are drowned and the
   rest of the Egyptians of evil have given him up--and he may go on his
   way to the promised land in peace so far as his old taskmasters are
   concerned.

   Remember, also, dear Friends, that when these people were thought to be
   hopelessly entangled, they were about to see the Lord perform for them
   a work which would be most helpful to their ultimate conquest of
   Canaan, for when Pharaoh and his chariots were drowned in the sea,
   Palestine heard of it and all the natives there began to tremble. Thus
   sang Moses in his famous song, "Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by
   the greatness of Your arm they shall be as still as a stone. The people
   shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold of the inhabitants of
   Palestine." That day in which a convert has to fight out the battle,
   once and for all with himself, shall give him strength for all future
   conflict and smooth his pathway into the land that flows with milk and
   honey!

   You must not think, young Christian, because you are saved from guilt,
   that everything is done and the warfare ended! There is a life-long
   conflict for you before you obtain possession of your inheritance and,
   it may be that, if now, when you are in special trouble, you are found
   faithful, all the rest of the road will be cleared from similar
   troubles. Now shall the Egyptians be drowned in the sea! Some of us can
   remember the time when we had to stand still and seriously ask, "Can I
   now be true to the Lord and His Law? I am advised the other way by a
   very prudent friend. Can I reject this advice? I can see the worldly
   advantage that I should gain through acting in a crooked course. Can I
   forego that advantage? I can see that I shall have to suffer if I am
   conscientious. Can I take up my cross?" When, after hours of anguish
   and prayer, you have come out of every entanglement pure and free, from
   that time forth the Lord may lift up the light of His Countenance upon
   you, and your victory over all other adversaries will be easy. Will not
   this comfort some of you who have just come to the Red Sea? The place
   of test and trial shall be the place of the ending of the foe!

   Why had the Lord led the people so far if He would not still help them?
   Do I hear someone say, "I fear that I shall never get out of my
   difficulties"? Yet you believe that the Lord has brought you out from
   the dominion of Satan? Tell me, has God brought you so far to let you
   perish? He has broken off the yoke of sin. He has given you a hope in
   Christ and you are a changed man. Do you think that He would do all
   this for you and then leave you? Come, my Brother, has the Lord brought
   you out of Egypt, by the precious blood of the Lamb, that you should
   die in the wilderness? Do you believe that Jesus has redeemed you to
   let you be lost, after all? I would speak personally to any elderly
   Christians here who begin to think that they shall one day fall by the
   hand of the enemy. How old are you? "Sixty." Sixty? How long do you
   expect to live? Answer: ten years. Then if God has taken care of you
   for 60 years, can you not trust Him for the odd ten? "Well," says one,
   "I am eighty." Eighty? How long do you reckon to remain on earth Are
   you going to doubt for the few years that are yet to come? Have you
   trusted your God for 80 long years? Do not doubt Him now, I pray you!
   Do not please the devil by distrusting your faithful God! As surely as
   Jehovah begins, He will finish! It shall never be said of any work of
   God, "He began to build and was not able to finish." If He has set you
   on the way to the eternal inheritance, He will surely bring you into
   it! God is never defeated or turned aside. "He shall not fail nor be
   discouraged." Comfort one another, therefore, with such words as these.

   Lastly, the Lord must bring Israel out of all entanglement, for how
   else could He be glorified? Suppose that the Israelites had been left
   to perish when Pharaoh said they were shut in? What then? What would
   the Lord have done for His great name? Would not the Egyptians have
   exulted over Israel's God? A Scotch minister tells the story of an aged
   saint who, on her dying bed, said that her Savior would never leave her
   to perish. "But suppose that He did not keep His promise and you were
   to be lost?" She answered, "He would be a greater loser than I." When
   asked what she meant, she answered, "It is true that I would lose my
   soul, but God would lose His honor and His Glory if He were not true."

   Brothers and Sisters, if we have trusted in God, and have come out of
   the Egypt of the world through His Grace, and have left all its sins
   behind us--if we were left to die in the wilderness--the Lord Jesus
   Christ would lose His Glory as a Savior, the Divine Father would lose
   His name for immutable faithfulness and the Holy Spirit would lose His
   honor for perseverance in completing every work which He undertakes!
   The Lord God of Israel will never stain His Glory-- therefore be
   confident that He who brought you out of Egypt will bring you into
   Canaan! How I delight in that verse which we sang just now--

   "My name from the palms of His hands eternity will not erase; Impressed
   on His heart it remains in marks of indelible Grace. Yes, I to the end
   shall endure, as sure as the earnest is given; More happy, but not more
   secure, the glorified spirits in Heaven." "Ah" murmurs one, "I don't
   believe that!" Then I am sorry for you, for, "according to your faith
   be it unto you." "I believe," says one, "that men may fall away and
   perish." It will be an evil thing for you if it should be to you
   according to

   your faith! If you have Grace enough to grasp the whole range of
   blessing which the Covenant of God offers you, then the whole shall be
   yours by a covenant of salt. He that thinks he can be off and on with
   God--saved today and lost tomorrow, and then saved again--has a
   comfortless creed to defend and a world of absurdities to meet! You are
   born again! Suppose that you could lose the new life which comes by the
   new birth? What then? I have heard of people being born again, but
   could they be born again, and again, and again? According to the notion
   of some, certain persons are born again, and again, and again, and
   again, and again I do not know how many times! There is nothing in
   Scripture to warrant such a strange idea.

   If you, my Friend, will come and cast yourself on Christ and take Him
   to be your Savior, once and for all, He will save you right now with an
   everlasting salvation! He says, "The water that I shall give him shall
   be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." Jesus,
   Himself, has said it, "I give unto My sheep, eternal life, and they
   shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand."
   Believe for this with heroic faith! Believe for eternal salvation in
   Jesus Christ, who is able to work in you a livelong escape from sin!
   According to your faith, so shall it be.

   Oh, no! The devil may say that we are entangled in the land, the
   wilderness has shut us in! But we shall get out of the labyrinth right
   enough. Is it not written, "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for
   you are not under the law, but under Grace"? We shall yet sing unto the
   Lord who has triumphed gloriously. He has thrown our sins and our fears
   into the sea. So be it! Hallelujah! Amen.

A Call To Prayer and Testimony

   (No. 2189)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 8, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I have set watchmen upon your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never
   hold their peace day nor night: you that make mention of the Lord, keep
   not silent, and give Him no rest, till He establishes, and till he
   makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth." Isaiah 62:6, 7.

   IN the opening verses of this chapter our Lord declares that He will
   not rest till His purpose of Grace is accomplished. "For Zion's sake
   will I not hold My peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest."
   His soul is set upon the perfection of His Church. There is never a
   moment when the heart of Christ ceases to beat high with desire for the
   salvation of His redeemed. From the dreadful work of making Atonement,
   He stayed not His hand, but set His face like a flint towards it, till
   He could say, "It is finished." And now, the work of the gathering of
   His chosen He carries on with quenchless zeal, never staying His Divine
   intercession, never withholding His hands from wielding that "All
   Power" which is given Him in Heaven and in earth.

   Mark well, Beloved, how He would have His people to be in tune with
   Himself! He will have no rest till salvation work is done! And He would
   not have us rest, but He would have us stirred with passionate desire
   and fired with holy zeal for the accomplishment of the Divine plan of
   Grace. Till He holds His peace, He will not allow us to be silent! You
   that have the Revised Version will be struck with the more literal and
   forcible rendering of our text--"You that are the Lord's remembrancers,
   take you no rest, and give Him no rest, till He establishes, and till
   He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth." A restless Savior calls upon
   His people to be restless and to make the Lord, Himself, restless--to
   give Him no rest till His chosen city is in full splendor, His chosen
   Church complete and glorious. Ah, when the three unite, the Son, the
   people whom He has redeemed and the Lord who works all things, then
   shall the golden age have come!

   Learn from this fact a valuable lesson, that Christ's determination to
   perform a work, His decree that it shall be so, is no argument for our
   idleness, but is the best plea and encouragement for our endeavors. "If
   it is to be," cries one, "I need not do anything." No, Friend, you
   argue slothfully! On the contrary, the earnest heart will reason itself
   into immediate and confident action. If it were not to be, to what
   purpose my zeal? Even if I do not know whether it is to be or not to
   be, if I think it desirable, I will labor for it with anxiety! But if I
   am assured that the Lord has appointed it, I labor with might and main,
   feeling a holy confidence in doing the work of the Lord! Since He wills
   it, we will it--and so it shall be.

   Predestination, when rightly understood, never leads to sloth--it has
   frequently, in human history, been of tremendous force for the
   production of the most daring and determined action--and it shall be so
   again. "Deus vult," God wills it, is a grand cry to produce a crusade!
   God wills it, therefore it shall be. Like thunderbolts flung from an
   almighty hand, Believers crash through every difficulty under the
   irrepressible impulse of fulfilling a Divine purpose. Oh, that our
   meditations at this time may bring us all to this resolve, that we will
   not rest, and we will give God no rest, till His decree is fulfilled
   and till He has established and made Jerusalem a praise in the earth!

   I. In my text I see three things which I will mention one by one. The
   first is RESPONSIBLE OFFICE--"I have set watchmen upon your walls."
   "You that make mention of the Lord, keep not silent," or, as your
   margin and the Revised Version have it, "You that are the Lord's
   remembrancers." Here are three responsible offices--watchmen set upon
   the walls, speakers who never hold their peace and remembrancers who
   cease not to plead with their Lord.

   May the Holy Spirit help us while we think of the Lord's people as
   watchmen! In times of war every fortified city had upon its walls
   certain watchmen, so placed as to see eye to eye--that is to say, the
   eye of one sentinel reached to the eye of another and so they
   encompassed the city round about. Whoever passed that way by day or
   night, they challenged him!

   And if he turned out to be a foe, they gave an alarm and straightway
   men-at-arms came forth from the guard rooms and the city was protected
   against surprise. God's people and especially the stronger, the more
   instructed and the most experienced of them, should, for Christ's sake,
   act as watchmen upon the walls.

   Observe what manner of watchmen we ought to be. It is written, "I have
   set watchmen." We are under Divine command! In the old Roman days, when
   a sentry was placed in his position by his centurion, he never thought
   of quitting his post. Rocks might roam, but not the sentinels of the
   empire! There was found in Pompeii, among the ashes, a sentry, standing
   in his place with his javelin in his hand--he had not flinched amid the
   deadly shower which fell from the volcano and buried the city. His
   centurion, in the name of the emperor, had set him there, and there he
   stood! How steadfast and immovable ought these to be, whom the Lord,
   Himself, has set in their place in connection with His Church! It is
   Jehovah who says, "I have set watchmen upon your walls." By a Divine
   arrangement and by a sacred command, saints are set in their positions
   and they must stand fast and, having done all, must still stand, for
   they have received their charge from the King, Himself.

   These watchmen guarded the city of cities, "your walls, O Jerusalem."
   The legionary who guarded old Rome felt that if he did not fight for
   his native city, he would be base, indeed. If we are set to guard the
   Church of God, what shall I say to him who sleeps at his post, or
   proves a traitor? If you do not throw your whole strength into the
   guarding of such a cause as this, what will awaken you? Know you not
   that the Church is purchased by the blood of Christ? That it is God's
   peculiar heritage? "The Lord's portion is His people." O shepherds,
   watch well the sheep that cost your Lord so dearly! "Feed the flock of
   God which He has purchased with His own blood." If we do not guard the
   Truth of God, once and for all delivered to the saints, we are
   something worse than traitors! No word has yet been invented which can
   set forth the perfidy of the man who betrays the cause of Christ and of
   the Gospel! He is the murderer of souls. God has set us to guard His
   own city, and we must not slumber. Let the other cities go, if go they
   must, but as for you, Salem, City of Peace and City of God, if I forget
   you, let my right hand forget her cunning! If I count you not beyond my
   chief joy, let me be in sorrow forever! See, Brethren, your responsible
   office--watchmen of God's setting--watchmen on the walls of God's own
   city!

   The service is seen to be responsible to the utmost degree when we see
   that it demands constant care. The Lord says of these watchmen, "they
   shall never hold their peace day nor night." We are not set to keep the
   Church of God by day only, but amid the dews or frosts of the darkest
   night we are to maintain our watch! Christians are to be sentries who
   will not retreat into the barracks because of the cold, nor quit the
   rampart because of the heat. At night, watchmen are most required. We
   are to be instant in season, giving the password at each particular
   time when the watch reports itself, and thus never holding our peace
   day nor night. We are to be instant out of season--for at such times
   the enemy is most likely to come. God's watchmen are not taken on by
   the hour, to watch by turns, but they are bound to be, throughout life,
   watchers for souls! We are never off duty! We take a day and a night
   shift. Our rest is in the Lord's service. Our recreation is in change
   of occupation. Ours is a life service and a constant service.

   Believers raise no discussion with their Lord as to how many hours of
   the day they shall spend for Him. Our hours are these--"They shall
   never hold their peace day nor night." St. Augustine desired to be
   always found aut precantem, aut predicantem--that is, either praying or
   preaching--either speaking to God for men in prayer, or speaking for
   God to men in His ministry. Ministers of Christ, especially, should
   give themselves, not to the serving of tables, but to the ministry of
   the Word and to prayer. For us to give ourselves to getting up
   entertainments, to become competitors with theatres and music halls, is
   a great degradation of our holy office! If I heard of a minister
   becoming a chimney-sweep to earn his living, I would honor him in both
   his callings, but for God's watchmen to become the world's showmen is a
   miserable business! God keep all of us who are ministers of Christ from
   entangling ourselves with the things of this life! The proverb says,
   "Stick to your last, cobbler." And I would say--"Stick to your pulpit,
   minister! Keep to your one work and you will find quite enough for all
   the strength you have, and even more." Oh, for preachers who "shall
   never hold their peace"!

   You Christian people, you, also, must fulfill your watch. You, also,
   are called to ceaseless service. A policeman wears an armlet to show
   that he is on duty--and all Believers should feel that such a badge is
   worn upon their very heart day and night. "The love of Christ
   constrains us," not now and then, but always! Our service of the Lord's
   cause comes not once a week, on Sundays, but so often as we have
   opportunity! These must always watch, who would be watchmen for

   souls, watchmen for God, watchers against error and sin, watchers for
   the coming of the Lord. "I have set watchmen upon your walls, O
   Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night."

   But, in the next place, we are to be spokesmen, for we are never to
   hold our peace, but make mention of the Lord. Believers are to speak
   for God to the people. If you have the ability and the commission,
   speak to the great congregation. You have both ability and commission,
   each one of you, to speak to those round about you. Be always ready to
   speak a word in season. Keep a shot in the locker--never run short of a
   good word for those whom God's Providence puts in your way. If there is
   nobody near to whom you can speak for God, then in your solitude speak
   to God for your fellow men. What a blessed thing to be so familiar with
   God that you have His ear for your friends and neighbors! Plead with
   Him for the erring, the unbelieving, the profane. Never hold your peace
   towards God, for in this case, speech is more than golden. By prayer
   you unlock the treasuries of Heaven--keep the golden key in constant
   motion. Never cease to pray, since intercession is benediction. If the
   world is asleep, if the Church is asleep, hold not your peace by night
   and, should the Church become active and the world be a little
   awakened, redouble your prayer till the world is won! You spokesmen for
   God and spokesmen to God, never hold your peace day or night!

   Sick saints are especially set to take the night watches. While the
   most of us are blessed with refreshing slumber, these find that sleep
   forsakes their eyes. They hear the clock's unwearied tick and listen to
   the slow striking of the hours. Now let them lift their hearts
   heavenward on behalf of the Lord's cause and Kingdom. Maybe God arouses
   them to this end-- that they may keep the nights safe by their
   prayers--chasing away evil spirits and keeping the incense burning upon
   the altar of acceptable intercession! The Lord girdles the globe with
   intercessions by his daily and nightly watchers. As our Queen's morning
   drum beats round the globe, so does ceaseless prayer cast a belt of
   golden Grace around the earth. O you that are the Lord's remembrancers,
   never suffer the flame of prayer to die down! Arise, even in this night
   season of the Church, and trim your lamps! Lift up your voices for your
   God and with your God. Let no dumb spirit possess you. As speakers
   heavenward and earthward, never hold your peace day or night!

   A third office is brought before us in the marginal reading and in the
   new version--"You that are the Lord's remembrancers, take no rest."
   This is an amazing expression--"The Lord's remembrancers." I find the
   same word elsewhere translated, "recorder"--and truly we are to be the
   Lord's recorders and keep in memory His great goodness. A high office
   is that of Remembrancer to the King of kings! Every Christian holds
   this eminent position. Oriental kings maintained an officer whose
   business it was to remind the king of the promises which he had made
   before. He said this to that courtier, that to the other, but His
   Majesty had plenty of other things to think of and, therefore, every
   now and then, his Remembrancer would say, "Please, Your Majesty, you
   promised to do this and that. May it please you to perform your word."

   Now the Lord has appointed His praying people to be His remembrancers.
   I should never have dared to use such an expression had I not found it
   in the Inspired Word, itself. The Lord says, in Isaiah 43:26, "Put Me
   in remembrance." The Lord cannot forget, but in condescension to our
   forgetfulness, He bids us act as if He could do so, and put Him in
   remembrance! By calling the promise to the Lord's remembrance, we are,
   ourselves, made to be the better acquainted with it. I find that a
   Remembrancer was also appointed in our English courts to remind the
   officers of their duty to their sov-ereign--and this is also a part of
   our work to remind the world that there is a God--and that He claims
   obedience from His creatures. Brothers and Sisters, fulfill your
   office!

   If you would be good remembrancers towards God, you must know the
   promises of which you remind Him. You must be acquainted with your
   Bibles so as to fill your mouths with arguments and order your
   petitions aright. You must come to the great King and say, "Lord, do as
   You have said. Fulfill this Word unto Your servant whereon You have
   caused me to hope." If we pray without a promise, we have no reason to
   expect an answer. God will do what He has promised to do--he may do
   somewhat more, but we have no right to expect it. The best praying in
   the world is pleading the promises! I wish we all practiced this sort
   of prayer. It is wise to bring before the Lord His own Words and plead
   His Divine veracity--"You have said it. You are true, therefore fulfill
   Your Word!" It is your business, as the Lord's remembrancers, to be
   well acquainted with these sacred Words of Grace which you are to bring
   to remembrance. If you do not remember them, yourself, how can you
   bring them to the Lord's memory?

   Your office of remembrancer is to be carried on incessantly. "You that
   are the Lord's remembrancers, take you no rest and give Him no rest." I
   fear that very many of God's promises are seldom used. They are like
   the locksmith's bunch

   of keys. Why are they so rusty? Because they are not in constant use.
   They have not been turned in the lock day by day, or they would be
   bright enough. Are there not exceedingly great and precious promises
   which, to some of you, are a dead letter? Promises lie hidden away in
   God's most Holy Word which you have never used! Perhaps you do not even
   know that they are there. One came to me, not long ago, and said, "I
   was surprised to find these words in the Bible." To him I answered,
   "Your remark makes me fear that you have not searched your Bible as you
   should have done." We ought to know the length and breadth of the
   estate which the Lord has given us. Oh, that we would incessantly use
   the promises in prayer! One said, with a smile, the other day, "It is a
   fine thing to have a checkbook, to get what money you please by signing
   your name!" I did not stop to explain to him the limits of that power,
   but I noted that he looked like one who, if he had owned such a
   checkbook as he spoke of, would have written down larger amounts than
   the most of us could compass!

   Still, his folly was not equal on the one side to the stupidity of
   these who err in the other direction, for they have a checkbook and yet
   never use it! The treasury of Heaven lies open to faith and yet we fret
   and worry about our little daily cares. We have but to plead a promise
   of God, to put Him in remembrance, and He will supply all our needs!
   Why, then, do we pine in need? Fools that we are, to be anxious and
   poverty-stricken with the possibilities of infinite riches close at
   hand! Who among us is there that comes up to the text, "You that are
   the Lord's remembrancers, take you no rest and give Him no rest"? Thus
   much upon the office--may the Holy Spirit lead all Believers to
   undertake and carry on this sacred work!

   Ministers, Deacons and Elders of Churches are specially called to this.
   You older and more advanced Christians should lead the way in this holy
   employment and, as I have already shown you, the sick must take their
   turn. Every Christian should aspire to take his place in the cordon and
   in some way watch on the behalf of Zion. But especially should we be
   constant, instant and fervent in pleading the precious promises of our
   Lord. These were not given to be forgotten, but to be pleaded and then
   to be fulfilled. It is written, "For this will I be enquired of by the
   house of Israel, to do it for them." It is the rule of God's Kingdom
   that we must bring to His remembrance the promise which we would have
   fulfilled in our own experience! Therefore, "You that are the Lord's
   remembrancers, take you no rest."

   II. My second head is a REMARKABLE CAUTION--"You that are the Lord's
   remembrancers, take you no rest." I quote the best translation.

   Take no rest from prayer. Be always praying. If not always in the act
   of prayer, be always in the spirit of prayer. "Pray without ceasing."
   Not only reason, but wrestle with God in prayer. Sometimes pray without
   words and, sometimes, with them. Pray alone, but often pray with
   Brothers and Sisters. There is special prevalence in the prayer of two
   or three. "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that
   they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in
   Heaven." Gather in the greater congregations for prayer. "Forsake not
   the assembling of yourselves together, as the manner of some is," as, I
   regret to say, the manner of many Churches has come to be in these
   days. The moderns despise the meeting for prayer and in this, they
   condemn themselves, by acknowledging that they attach little value to
   their own prayers! Possibly their consciousness of having lost all
   power with God in prayer is thus betraying itself. Where the Prayer
   Meeting is despised, there may be cleverness in the preacher, but there
   will be no unction for the hearer. O my Brothers and Sisters, I beseech
   you, both as individuals and as a Church, do not restrain prayer!
   "Watch and pray"--that precept is a condensation of our text.

   Never rest from prayer because you are weary of it. Whenever prayer
   becomes distasteful, it should be a loud call to pray all the more. No
   man has such need to pray as the man who does not care to pray. When
   you can pray and long to pray--why, then, you will pray! But when you
   cannot pray and do not wish to pray--why, then, you must pray, or evil
   will come of it! He is on the brink of ruin who forgets the Mercy Seat.
   When the heart is apathetic towards prayer, the whole man is sickening
   from a grievous disease. How can we be weary of prayer? It is essential
   to life! When a man grows weary of breathing, surely he is near to
   dying! When a man grows weary of praying, surely we ought to pray
   anxiously for him, for he is in an evil case.

   Never rest from prayer because you have prayed enough. When has a man
   prayed enough? The greatest pleaders with God in prayer are the
   hungriest after more of it. The more a man gets from God, the more he
   desires from God. Those who have but little, ask but little--but to him
   that has shall be given--and he shall have abundance. Does anyone say,
   "I have long been prayerful and watchful, and I shall now take things
   more easily"? Yes. I saw a good man taking it easy the

   other day--he was riding upon a bicycle with both feet off the
   pedals--and with the brake in full force. I did not blame the cyclist,
   but one thing was quite clear--he was going down the hill. He would not
   have had his feet on the rests in that fashion if he had been upon the
   upgrade. Brother, whenever you begin to put your legs up and have no
   more work to do, you are going down hill and there is no doubt about
   it! The way to Heaven is up hill, and every inch of the way will need
   effort--for the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence. Grace does not
   exempt us from activity, but works it in us. If you know the power of
   the weapon called, "all-prayer," never put it into its sheath, but
   continually call upon the Lord, and in this matter, "take no rest."

   Do not fall into the habit ofpraying as a matter of routine. "You that
   are the Lord's remembrancers, take you no rest." I have heard of
   soldiers sleeping while on the march and I have known some good people
   sleep while praying, till I have thought that their prayers were a kind
   of pious snore. They go on with the old phrases without considering
   what they mean by them. They are like crickets, whose notes are forever
   the same. "I sleep," says the spouse, "but my heart wakes." But these
   might more truly say, "I do not sleep, and yet my heart is not awake."
   Many prayers are like a grocer's or a draper's account--"Ditto, ditto,
   ditto." The petitions are as "per usual." It is dreary work when we
   have the shell of prayer before us, but have no oyster in it. The
   Brother's lips are here in prayer, but his soul has gone home to his
   shop, or to his farm. The sails of his mill go round as the wind blows,
   but he is not grinding anything--there is no grist in the mill, no
   intelligent, loving desire. Let us get out of the ruts of phrases and
   set petitions! Mere routine religion is hateful and yet how easily we
   all fall into it! Let us not rest on our oars and hope to make progress
   by the impetus already gained. All progress made heavenward by the
   natural drift of the current is seeming and not real. All worship which
   is mechanical is, so far, dead! God is a Spirit and we can only worship
   Him acceptably in spirit and in truth--if the spirit is gone, the very
   truth of the worship is gone--and it becomes an offense rather than a
   sweet-smelling savor.

   Brethren, take no rest, so as to pray by fits and starts. Look at what
   has been done in many Churches--they plan to have a grand time--and
   possibly they succeed. Everybody comes up to the Prayer Meetings and
   all appear to be in earnest about the conversion of souls. There is
   great excitement and probably much good is done. But after that there
   is a reaction, a stupor of indifference. As in nature, after high
   hills, deep valleys--so is it with some religious communities. We say
   of a man, in the proverb, "He is as sound asleep as a church." Yes,
   very good. Nothing sleeps so soundly as a church and, especially after
   a time of excitement. Men who are at one time lively beyond measure,
   are apt at another time to sleep beyond waking! After a high wind there
   may come a lull, wherein everything drops, and stagnation reigns
   supreme. The Lord save us from spasmodic religion!

   "You that make mention of the Lord, take you no rest." Always keep in a
   high state of revival, or if that is a state which cannot be
   maintained, suspect that it is a condition unhealthy and undesirable.
   If there is a kind of celestial delirium here and there--and I am
   afraid that such is a correct description of it--avoid it! The wild
   fury of the flesh, in which everything is done by noise, and men are
   saved by bluster, is not of God! An excitement which cannot be kept up,
   since the spirit of man would be exhausted by it, is questionable. An
   excitement which is lawless and ungovernable, since the Spirit of God
   is not ruling it, is to be dreaded. Fanaticism is a tornado of the
   flesh and not the health-giving breath of the Holy Spirit. It is well
   to be as you would always wish to be. That pace is best which can, by
   Divine Grace, be maintained from year to year. Enoch walked with
   God--he could not have run with Him, but he was always enabled to keep
   in step with God--and God's pace is always the right one. Oh, for a
   gracious energy which does not flag, but goes from strength to
   strength! "You that are the Lord's remembrancers, take you no rest."

   Above all, let us never rest out of despair. The feeling does come over
   us, sometimes--"What is the use of our labor? So little comes of it.
   What is the use of protesting for the Truth of God? The Churches will
   not hear you. You only earn ill-will, and are ridiculed as an old fogy.
   What is the use of being earnest about winning souls? Men are
   indifferent. The present engrosses thought--social questions are
   pressing. Everybody pines for sensationalism or amusement. What profit
   is there in keeping to the old way?" That spirit creeps over the child
   of God like the cold of the Arctic regions, numbing him and tending to
   send him into the sleep of despair. The evidence of this evil power is
   found in the tendency to restrain prayer before God. From this may our
   God rescue us! Come, my Brothers and Sisters, I do not know who among
   you is going to sleep, but I would like to shake the man who is so
   benumbed, and wake him up. And I hope that, in your turn, when you see
   me benumbed, you will shake me, also, and wake me up to diligence in
   prayer!

   Let us awake this morning and begin again! We must not, will not, yield
   to slumber! There is small cause for fear and no cause for despair. Our
   cause defeated? Not a bit of it! All will yet come right. God waits,
   but He waits that He may be gracious unto us. His time to favor Zion
   will come and the good old cause will win the victory! "The work of the
   Lord is in a greater hand than ours. He will not fail nor be
   discouraged." "Men ought always to pray, and not to faint"--and when
   they feel that they are fainting--they should resolve to pray with
   double earnestness--and faintness will yield to

   joy.

   Only one more observation--avoid setting any time limits to God in your
   prayers. He says, "You that are the Lord's remembrancers, take you no
   rest." A wife said that she would pray for her husband for 10 years and
   if he was not converted, then, she would conclude that there would be
   no use in further pleading. To that good wife I would say, "You are
   right in praying 10 years, but you must not limit the Holy One of
   Israel! Who are you to put your finger down on the almanac and say,
   'God shall answer me on such a day, or I will pray no more'? Plead for
   your husband as long as he lives." "Well," says one, "I have been
   praying a long time for a favor, but I am now inclined to cease
   pleading for it." If you have a question about the rightness of the
   prayer, do not persevere in a mistake. Solve as quickly as possible the
   question as to the correctness of the request, for if you waver on that
   point, your prayer will be of that wavering kind which meets no
   acceptance with the Lord! If you are asking what you know the Lord has
   promised and what is certainly for His Glory, you may pray with
   confidence--and you may even spend the last breath in your body in
   praying for it! Give the Lord no rest and take no rest, yourself, but
   incessantly, perpetually, continually plead with God till He answers
   you out of His holy place.

   III. And so I come, in the last place, to dwell upon the third matter,
   which is very amazing. The charge to take no

   rest was notable, but here is A STILL MORE REMARKABLE CHARGE--Give Him
   no rest." What a word is this! I

   speak with solemn awe! When the Lord condescends so greatly, we must be
   doubly reverent. Give God no rest? I am amazed at such a command! Come,
   gracious Spirit and teach me how to speak!

   I see then, first, very clearly, that importunity is here commanded.
   "Give Him no rest" is our Lord's own command to us concerning the great
   God. I do not suppose any of you ever advised a beggar to be
   importunate with you. Did you ever say, "Whenever you see me go over
   this crossing, ask me for a penny. If I do not give you one, run after
   me, or call after me all the way down the street. If that does not
   succeed, lay hold upon me and do not let me go until I help you. Beg
   without ceasing." Did any of you ever invite applicants to call often
   and make large requests of you? Oh, no! Importunity is a common enough
   thing when men are seeking earthly gifts, but it is so sadly rare in
   heavenly concerns, that the Lord has to exhort us to be importunate
   with Him! He does, in effect, say, "Press Me! Urge Me! Lay hold on My
   strength! Wrestle with Me, as when a man seeks to give another a fall
   that he may prevail with him." All this, and much more, is included in
   the expression, "Give Him no rest." Importunity is commanded!

   Importunity is influential with God. How vividly the Savior sets this
   forth in His parables! The poor widow seeks justice of an unrighteous
   judge. She had a good case and she appeared in court begging for
   justice, where she might expect it. She cried, "My Lord, hear my suit!"
   She meets with no response--the harsh magistrate declares that he
   cannot attend to her. The court is occupied with other cases. At the
   first pause the widow is heard crying, "My Lord, there is now an
   interval! Will you hear me?" She is sternly refused. Another day she
   appears, and another, and another--her case is urgent, and she is in
   terrible earnest to be heard. She is put out of the court, over and
   over. Then the order is given that she shall be kept out. But she gets
   in, somehow, and her voice, so touching and piercing, is heard in
   season and out of season, seeking to be delivered from her adversary.
   Just as the court is closing she cries, "My Lord!" and is answered,
   "Have not I told you many times before that I cannot attend to you?"
   "But, my Lord!" He turns on his heels and is gone to his home.

   The next morning, when he comes forth from his gate, there is the
   widow. She cries, "My Lord!" With a curse he spurns her. He goes down
   to the court and he takes his seat. You see "His Excellency" on the
   bench with his officers around him--a very great personage is he! The
   first thing he hears is, "My Lord, I pray you, avenge me of my
   adversary!" "That woman again! Let her be removed. Go on with the next
   case." All day long, whenever there is a pause, or when His Lordship
   rises to retire, there is the same bitter wail, "O my Lord, hear me, I
   pray you!" The widow haunts him! He dreams about the sad-faced woman
   with the uplifted finger, and the cry, "Hear me, my Lord! Hear me!" The
   next morning it is no dream. He is at breakfast when the servant says,
   "A person begs to see you, Sir. She has been at the

   door very often and she will not go away." "What is she like?" "Well,
   it is a woman dressed in mourning--no doubt a widow." "Drive her away!
   She is a common nuisance!"

   He goes to the court and there is the woman--and she begins again. Then
   the judge says to himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet
   because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her
   continual coming she weary me." The Lord puts that woman's importunity
   before us as a model and as an encouragement! "And shall not God avenge
   His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him?" Pray like that widow.
   Do not take, "No," for an answer!

   Study that other picture. A man has a friend who arrives at his door in
   the dead of night. The friend has been walking a long, long way and is
   worn out. When he gets to the door, he says, "I am glad I have got here
   at last. I lost my way in the burning heat of the sun and it has taken
   me many hours to find the track and reach your door. Give me, I pray
   you, a morsel of bread, for I am near to die of hunger." "I have not a
   morsel in the house. I have nothing to set before you. Come in and try
   to sleep, for food I have none." "Alas, I could not sleep, I am so
   faint with hunger. I pray you, find me food, or I shall perish." The
   compassionate householder resolves to go down the street to a friend
   and beg from him, three cakes. He knocks at the door, but he has no
   answer. He knocks, and knocks, and calls aloud to his neighbor. The
   answer comes from the top of the roof that the man is in bed and cannot
   rise at that unearthly hour to search for bread.

   The householder is not to be put off, for his friend is dying of
   hunger. And so he knocks and shouts, and ceases not. The man in bed on
   the roof tries to sleep, but the noise is too great, and the children
   are being frightened and asking what is the matter. He hears the
   pleadings of his friend and again reminds him that the request is
   unreasonable at such an hour. But this does not end the matter. Knock!
   Knock! Knock! Call! Call! Call! "I will not go down!" vows the man in
   bed. "I will not go away!" says the man below! He keeps up an incessant
   shout and clatter. Again you hear knock! Knock! Knock! The man has
   turned on the other side and tried to go to sleep, but he cannot manage
   it--that knocking is too vigorous. Although he will not help him
   because he is his friend, "yet because of his importunity he will rise
   and give him as many as he needs." Pray after this manner and you shall
   prevail! Oh, for Grace to knock till God's door is opened! You may have
   what you will if you understand the art of importunity!

   "Give Him no rest!" Importunity would not have been commanded had it
   not been right for us and prevalent with God! How safely may we commend
   what the Lord commands! God is to be moved by the importunate prayers
   of His people. He will hear! He must hear, if we will pray with
   persistent faith!

   Importunity on our part is the sign of coming action on God's part.
   Sometimes the Lord seems, according to Old Testament figure, to put His
   right hand into His bosom. We cry to Him, "O Lord, how long?" But His
   right hand is still in His bosom. Error prevails, sin triumphs, God's
   people are despised--but His right hand is still in His bosom. Take no
   rest from prayer and give Him no rest! Before long He will pluck His
   right hand out of His bosom and He will roll up His sleeve and you will
   see what His bare arm can do! He will work as soon as He sees that His
   time is come and that will be when we are in earnest and give Him no
   rest!

   Sometimes God's work goes on so well that we have much cause for
   gratitude and yet we feel that the pace might be greatly quickened. A
   sermon that could save a hundred could as readily save a thousand if
   God blessed it to that extent. The same Truth of God which sways one
   mind could sway a million minds if applied by the Great Spirit. There
   is no reason why the sowing of the Lord's Word should not bring forth a
   hundred-fold instead of twenty-fold. We may not dream that the Spirit
   of the Lord is straitened! When God is with us, all things are
   possible. When the Lord fires His saints with zeal, His own work never
   lags behind. God is never behind the desires of His people--in fact,
   their longings are prophecies of His giving. When we cry day and night,
   God will work day and night. When saints groan and sigh for revival, it
   is because the revival is already come and has begun within their
   souls! When the whole company of the faithful shall glow together with
   passionate desire and importunate prayer, we may know that our
   redemption draws near!

   Importunate prayer is the sign of a growing work. The sighs and cries
   of the Church are growing pains. Prayer is the thermometer of Divine
   Grace. The Lord has committed His Divine Force, in a large degree, to
   the custody of His people. Unbelief shuts up that Force--as it is
   written, "He did not many mighty works there because of their
   unbelief." Faith, on the other hand, sets the sacred Force free, for,
   "all things are possible to him that believes." When saints are all
   alive and instant in prayer, it is the index and token that the Lord
   will open the windows of Heaven and pour them out such a blessing that
   they shall not have room enough to receive it!

   I have done when I have urged you, my well-beloved Friends, to take
   this text as a lesson to be practiced. This first sermon on my return
   ought to be the keynote of this year's service of God. Have you a mind
   for great Grace and grand enterprises? Or do you prefer to slacken? I
   hope you will not hesitate, or choose the meaner part. Does the Lord
   put it into the heart of one and another to feel an agony concerning
   the unconverted? Do some of you feel a deep concern for the souls of
   others? Does this happen to you that teach in the Sunday school, or who
   go out to the lodging houses? Is this state of mind prevailing among
   the officers of the Church? Is this the condition of a large proportion
   of private members? Then a grand future lies before us! If God gives
   all of us to travail for souls, we shall see greater things than these!
   Brothers and Sisters, we hold the Truth of God! If we had wickedly
   departed from the way of the Lord, all the praying in the world would
   have brought us no spiritual progress! But holding fast the everlasting
   Gospel, what is now needed is the fire from Heaven to fall upon our
   altar and consume the sacrifice! Oh, for the Holy Spirit! Oh, for the
   working of God, Himself, in our midst!

   I exhort you who fear the Lord and are His appointed remembrancers, to
   be much in prayer and in testimony. Pray and preach! Keep not silent!
   Tell out the simple Gospel! The more you tell of pardon bought with
   blood, the better. I saw my dear Brother, Archibald Brown, this week,
   and he told me of a poor fellow in East London who had been visited by
   a soul-winning Brother. He had been a wild and wicked man. He was ill
   and the visitor talked long with him. It seemed to make no impression,
   till one day he explained Substitution to him and the man asked
   pointedly, "If I believe in Jesus, do you tell me that He took all my
   sins upon Himself?" "Yes, he bore all your sins in His own body on the
   tree." "Well, well," the man cried, "if He took them, I have not got
   them." "No," said the other, "that is the glorious Truth of God. The
   Lord suffered for your sins." "Then I shall not have to suffer for
   them?" "No," said the visitor. "Your sin is put away." "Never heard
   that before," said the rough man. "That is the most wonderful thing I
   ever heard. I believe it! Blessed be God, I believe it and I am saved!"
   Soon after his son came in--another fellow of the Bill Sykes
   [Fictitious character in Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist."--eod] order
   and the visitor began exhorting him. The older man cried out, "Give him
   that little bit! That will do it!"

   Just so, "that little bit will do it." The visitor told the story of
   Jesus dying in the sinner's place and the little bit did the work! Our
   chief business should be to cry, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes
   away the sin of the world." We must bid men look to Jesus and live!
   Keep not silent! Publish this salvation far and wide! Preach the Cross
   and plead the blood! Preach and pray for Jesus! He is All in All. Keep
   His Sacrifice to the front and God will bless His own Word! Oh, that He
   may now grant us a glorious period of genuine Grace-work! Amen.

Bit and Bridle--How To Escape Them

   (No. 2190)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 15, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go: I
   will guide you with My eyes. Beyou not as the horse, or as the mule,
   which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
   bridle, lest they come near to you." Psalm 32:8,9.

   THE joy of full forgiveness is described in the first two verses of
   this Psalm--"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin
   is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity
   and in whose spirit there is no guile." Oh, the blessedness of sitting
   at Jesus' feet, a sinner washed in His blood! Outside of Heaven there
   is no greater joy--and even there they sing of blood-washed robes!

   After a man is pardoned, anxiety is awakened as to how he shall be kept
   from sin in the future. The burnt child dreads the fire and, although
   his burns have all been healed, he dreads the fire none the less, but
   all the more. These who have been scorched by sin tremble at even a
   distant approach to the flame. You will always know whether you are
   delivered from the guilt of sin by answering this question--Am I
   delivered from the love of sin? He who lost his way yesterday feels his
   need of a guide today and tomorrow. How can the pardoned one endure the
   thought of sinning, again, against the Lord? David's great anxiety on
   this score is met by the gracious answer of the Lord--"I will instruct
   you and teach you in the way which you shall go."

   Another thing is noteworthy--David was now rid of guile as well as
   guilt. Orientals pride themselves on their cunning and David, by
   nature, had a considerable share of craft about him. But he now drives
   it from his spirit--he will not, from now on, tolerate himself in
   deceit. When he had thrown away this false wisdom, this carnal
   prudence, he felt that he must look elsewhere for guidance. If he is no
   longer to plot and plan with the cunning which he had shown in the
   matter of Uriah, he will need other direction--and he looks up for it.
   See how our gracious God comes in with the promise of guidance. "The
   meek will He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach His way."
   "The Lord preserves the simple." The upright, who can no longer trust
   their own deceitful hearts, shall find the Lord an all-sufficient
   Guide. Happy is it for them that He has spoken such a word as this--"I
   will instruct you and teach you in the way which you

   shall go."

   One other observation. We find David, in this Psalm, reaching to a high
   state of joy on account of his being forgiven. He exclaims, in the
   seventh verse, "You shall compass me about with songs of deliverance."
   A very proper state of mind to be in! It is meet that the pardoned
   sinner should leap for joy. But, at the same time, the wisdom of God
   comes in, not to check the joy, but to render it more deep, more
   sure--and to prevent its coming to an untimely end. David is in
   ecstasies of delight, but he is to be reminded that he is not yet in
   Heaven, and that he is compassed about with other things besides songs.
   The voice of God commends his joy, but also reminds him that there lies
   before him a future full of perils and a life strewn with temptations.
   He is, from then on, to be a disciple as well as a singer! He needs to
   be instructed and taught in the way, for he is still a pilgrim and not
   yet at his journey's end. Sound the timbrel, if you will, and shout for
   joy and sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously! But
   remember that on the other side of the Red Sea there is a wilderness
   and you will require much Divine Grace to traverse it--such Grace as
   only the Shepherd of Israel can give you. You will be wise to address
   yourselves to your journey and resolve to follow Him whose eyes discern
   the way, and whose hands can help you in it. A pilgrim's life is not
   all feasting. He has something else to do besides praising God upon the
   high-sounding cymbals. We must sit at Jesus' feet, as well as look to
   His Cross. We are to bear His yoke and learn of Him, that we may find
   rest for our souls.

   This may stand as an introduction, for now I need to conduct you
   further into this grave business of the saved man. You are pardoned, my
   Friend, you know you are, and you feel the joy of that knowledge. God
   grant that your joy may abound yet more and more! Sitting in your seat
   this morning, you are saying, "Oh, the heaped-up blessedness of the man
   whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is covered!" Yes, but you
   are not yet in Heaven! Something more is needed--not to secure the love
   of God, not to complete the work of Sovereign Grace--but to educate you
   for the skies, to make you meet to be a partaker of the inheritance of
   the saints in light! About that matter we are going to talk as the Holy
   Spirit shall enable us.

   That I may set before you, to the fullest, the teaching of the text, I
   would have you note, first, a privilege to be sought--Divine
   instruction, practical teaching and tender guidance. Secondly, a
   character to be avoided--"Be you not as the horse, or as the mule,
   which have no understanding." This will bring us to consider, thirdly,
   an infliction to be escaped--"Whose mouth must be held in with bit and
   bridle." If you do not wish to be bitted and bridled, be readily
   obedient to the direction of your Lord! We will come to a close by
   reflecting that there is a freedom to be attained. You may be free from
   bit and bridle and guided by the eyes of God. You may find your way to
   Heaven without the need of these rough chastisements which compel
   obedience. Oh, for the help of the great Teacher in this matter!

   I. First, here is A PRIVILEGE TO BE SOUGHT. I will proceed at once to
   set it forth from the words before us.

   This guidance is very full in its nature. Three words are used to
   describe it--"I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you
   shall go: I will guide you with My eyes."

   The first word is, "I will instruct you"--a promise more full of
   meaning than would appear upon its surface. God is prepared to give you
   an inward understanding of spiritual things, for His instruction is
   intensely effectual upon the mind. The Lord is prepared to teach you in
   His Truths--to make you wise in heavenly matters. Though saved, you
   are, as yet, a mere child, and unfamiliar with great Truths of God. You
   know but little of Divine things--you know little of yourself, little
   of your danger, little of holiness and little of God--but the Lord
   promises, here, to take you for His pupil and to be, Himself, your
   Instructor! He instructs so effectually as really to build up the mind
   and, therefore, the Psalmist says, "Through Your precepts I get
   understanding." Other instructors can awaken that measure of
   understanding which is already ours, but God gives understanding to the
   simple. A good understanding is one of the gifts of His Grace and
   blessed are they who receive it!

   The second word is, "I will teach you." And this teaching is most
   practical, for the promise is--"I will teach you in the way which you
   shall go." God adds the precept to the doctrine and instructs us in
   both. Eminently precious is that practical teaching by which you are
   made to know what to do and how to do it. Theoretical teaching is of
   small importance compared with this practical learning. The Lord will
   teach us the art and mystery of holiness. He will apprentice us to the
   Lord Jesus as the Master of Righteousness--he will make us journeymen,
   one of these days, and turn us into fullblown "workmen that need not to
   be ashamed." Our great Teacher sends forth fine workmen, whose good
   works are seen of men and cause them to glorify the Father in Heaven.

   The promise of the Lord, in the third word of the verse, goes even
   further than doctrinal and practical instruction, for we read, "I will
   guide you with My eyes." Herein is fellowship as well as instruction,
   for the guide goes with the traveler, and thus will God, in the process
   of our instruction, give us fellowship with Himself. Blessed are they
   who follow the Lamb wherever He goes--they have both the privilege of
   holy walk and heavenly company. It is our high privilege that, while
   our Shepherd goes before us, He calls us by name and we follow closely
   in His footsteps, as His well-beloved sheep. We are not only to be told
   the way and led into the way, but to be accompanied in it by our
   Teacher and Friend. The education which the Lord provides is complete
   in all its branches--mind, life and heart are all under the Divine
   tuition! This is no pauper school, or merely preparatory seminary--the
   text describes a high school of holiness, a grammar school of Grace, a
   University of holiness! In this place of sacred instruction, you may
   take high degrees, if you will, and also become teachers of others! He
   who forgave you provides everything for you that you can need to make
   you a disciple, indeed, a learner who in the ages to come shall make
   known to angels and principalities and powers the manifold wisdom of
   God! Who would not be a scholar in such a University as this?

   Note, next, that this teaching is Divine in its source. See how it
   runs--"I will instruct you." How delightful! "I will instruct you: I
   will guide you with My eyes." The Lord will not put us in a low class,
   where some half-instructed usher or pupil-teacher shall look after us.
   No, we shall, all of us, be taught by the Lord Jesus, Himself, and His
   Holy Spirit! It is

   written, "I will instruct you: I will guide you." Our Lord may instruct
   us by men who are taught of Himself, but, after all, the best of His
   servants cannot teach us anything profitably except the Lord, Himself,
   teaches by them and through them! He alone teaches us to profit. What a
   wonderful condescension it is that the Lord should become a Teacher!
   Sunday school teachers, adore the Head of your sacred college, even God
   Himself! "I will teach you, I will instruct you." They are well taught
   that are taught of God and this privilege is common to all the family
   of love, for the Scripture says, "All your children shall be taught of
   the Lord." It is not said that a portion of them shall be left to be
   trained by angels or archangels, but they shall all be taught of the
   Lord! Jehovah, Himself, will be the Instructor of every soul that comes
   to Him through Jesus Christ!

   Observe how wonderfully personal is this promised guidance. While the
   address in the ninth verse is in the plural, "Be you not as the horse,
   or as the mule," the promise is in the singular to each individual--"I
   will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go; I will
   guide you with My eyes." Wonder of wonders, the Infinite focuses
   Himself upon the insignificant! We who are less than the motes in the
   sunbeam, are, nevertheless, individually considered by Him who fills
   all in all, who is greater than all that He fills! "I will instruct
   you." Yes, Jehovah will condescend to instruct that Believer who is
   feeblest of all the company. Rejoice, my Brothers and Sisters, that
   though your understanding is a commonplace one, and though your
   position is very obscure, yet the Lord does not say, "I will send you
   to a preparatory school kept by some inferior teacher." But He does
   say, "I will instruct you." God instructs each Believer as truly as if
   He were His only child. It is delightful to reflect that while Christ's
   death has a sufficient efficacy in it to save a believing world, yet if
   His design had been to save only me, He would have to have offered the
   same Sacrifice as He has done. His death would have been necessary to
   prove that "He loved me, and gave Himself for me." So, while our Lord's
   teaching would suffice to instruct myriads of men who are willing to
   learn, yet does He condescend to bring all His teaching to bear upon
   each single person--"I will instruct you and teach you in the way which
   you shall go." I note with comfort, in the text, what the French call
   tu-toi-age. Speaking to one another very familiarly, they say, "you"
   and, "you." How sweetly is this seen in this passage--"I will instruct
   you and teach you in the way which you shall go. I will guide you with
   My eyes"! Hear you not the great Father talking to His dear child? Yes,
   I hear Him speaking to you and to me! Blessed be His name for such
   familiar love! Let us profit by its promise even to the fullest.

   Furthermore, this teaching is delightfully tender--"I will guide you
   with My eyes." That is to say, if you are willing to be so directed,
   the Lord will guide you, not by the rough means of bit and bridle,
   muzzle and cord, but with His eyes--a way which implies understanding
   on your part and love on His part. It is a recognition of confidence in
   us when He promises, thus, to guide us. The mistress at the head of the
   table gives a nod to Sarah. She knows what it means and the will of the
   lady is done at once. The master has not to enter into details with old
   John, who has been with him for so many years. John knows his wishes
   and a wink or a look will speak volumes! Well-trained children of God
   have their faces toward Him and soon perceive His mind--and this
   secures their prompt obedience. They see much in little and they make
   great account of every Word of the Lord. When we are what we ought to
   be, the guidance of the Lord is not sent us in thunder, but in a still
   small voice! And His instruction comes, not in tempests and hailstones,
   but in sunbeams and dewdrops. Some saints can be effectually led with a
   thread of hair. Cords of love and bands of a man are at once the most
   tender and the strongest bonds for a sanctified soul. "I will guide you
   with My eyes" is a charming promise, but it is of no use to the blind,
   the stubborn, the careless, or the self-willed. What a pity that any
   should debar themselves from so choice a privilege!

   See, dear Friends, you that have been lately pardoned, and you, of
   older years, who have long been forgiven, see what guidance there is
   for you all the way from your starting point to the gate of pearl at
   the end of the road! I say this because I mean to wind up this point
   with the remark--This teaching is constant. "I will instruct you and
   teach you; I will guide you." He that has begun to guide will not
   suddenly desert! He that has commenced to teach you will never dismiss
   you from His class! He that has, in a measure, instructed you and given
   you an understanding, will continue to teach you until He has perfected
   you in the knowledge of Himself and conformed you to the image of His
   Son! I feel most happy to think that such a privilege is promised and
   provided. I have heard of some who dream that, once forgiven, they may
   live as they wish--but to such I would say, "You know nothing about the
   matter. You are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of
   iniquity." The man who believes in Jesus for salvation, believes in Him
   so as to be set free from his sins--and his great anxiety is to be
   saved from all iniquity and to be led in the ways of righteousness to
   the glory of God!

   Here is comfort for you that are really seeking a holy life--God has
   made provision for your being led in it! He who has made you His child
   will put you in school and teach you until you shall know the Lord
   Jesus as the Way, the Truth, and the Life! You shall soon know your
   Father's name and Character and sing unto His praise among the bright
   intelligences that surround His Throne!

   II. I now ask your attention while I show you A CHARACTER TO BE
   AVOIDED. We are told that since the Lord is ready to instruct us, we
   are not to be stubborn and wayward. It is ours to be docile and
   obedient. "Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
   understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
   they come near to you."

   We are not to imitate creatures of which we are the superiors. Man is
   made to have dominion over the horse, the mule and the whole animal
   creation--let him not seek his models among his servants. I have
   sometimes heard speeches which have looked in that unwise direction.
   One said, in my hearing, as an excuse for a passionate speech, "I could
   not help it. If you tread on a worm it will turn." Is a worm to be the
   example for a saint? By a worm in that case, I suppose, is meant a
   serpent--and are you to follow serpents in their malice and venom? I
   have heard the same thing turned the other way-- and it has been made
   to appear as if an animal might be all the worse for copying a man. The
   driver of an omnibus was using his whip pretty freely upon one of his
   horses, and a gentleman sitting on the box-seat observed, "You never
   strike the horse on this side." "Bless you!" said the driver, "if I
   were to touch that mare, when I went near her in the stable at night,
   she would kick me like a Christian!" What a remarkable simile, was it
   not? "Like a Christian!" Is that so, that Christians kick? That
   Christians are found taking revenge? Here is a matter about which we
   would urgently cry, "Be you not as the horse, or as the mule." Never
   render evil for evil, railing for railing, for that is to copy the
   beasts of the field! Let us look upward to the highest for our model
   and never go down to the beasts of the field for models.

   We must mind that we do not imitate creatures to whom we are so near
   akin. The mule has a touch of the ass in it and I fear it is not the
   only creature of which this may be said. Is not man, as unredeemed,
   likened to the ass in the types of the Mosaic Law? Ah, Brothers and
   Sisters, we are likened in Scripture to many strange beasts, and not
   without reason! St. Augustine and other ancient writers discuss, at
   length, the likeness which exists between men and mules. I am not going
   to follow them in their observations, but would simply say with Dr.
   Donne, "They have gone far in these illusions and applications. And
   they might have gone as far further as it had pleased them--they have
   sea-room enough that will compare a beast and a sinner together--and
   they shall find many times, in the way, the beast the better man." I am
   afraid that it is so. David himself says, "So foolish was I, and
   ignorant: I was as a beast before You"--and yet he was so good a man
   that he could add, "Nevertheless I am continually with You." A large
   part of us is animal and its tendency is to drag down that part which
   is more than angelic. How abject and yet how august is man! Brother to
   the worm and yet akin to Deity! Immortal and yet a child of dust! Be
   not the prey of your lower natures--as children of God, yield not
   yourselves to that which it is your duty to subdue! Have the horse and
   mule in subjection--keep under your body--do not bear the burden of the
   animal but make the animal your burden-bearer. "Be you not as the
   horse, or as the mule," but rise superior to flesh and blood. May the
   Spirit of the Lord help your infirmities in this matter!

   I believe the Psalmist here alludes to the horse and mule as creatures
   naturally wild and needing to be broken and trained. We are by nature
   as the wild ass that inhales the wind of the wilderness--"he scorns the
   multitude of the city, neither regards he the crying of the driver."
   These wild creatures we can make nothing of till we break them in--be
   not like they--useless, untrained, unbroken. Yet this is how we begin
   life naturally and spiritually. It is good to get broken in early in
   life--"it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth." It is
   an ill thing for a man to have no restraint in youth and no trouble in
   manhood. When men and women follow out their own sweet wills, the end
   is seven-fold bitterness. A mind uncorrected is a vine unpruned, which
   yields no fruit, but trails along the ground and rots as it trails. It
   is a grand thing to learn the meaning of the word, "obey." It is ill
   with these who remain unsubdued. They are of little worth to themselves
   or to others. The Holy Spirit would not have any of the Lord's people
   to be of that wild, untamable character, for which there is neither use
   nor hope.

   Furthermore, we are not to imitate creatures devoid of reason. "Be you
   not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding." He
   especially lays stress on this--that they are without understanding.
   What does he mean by that? Horses and mules have been so trained that
   they have needed neither bit nor bridle and have performed marvelous
   feats at a word. It is possible for these animals to be brought to so
   high a training that they obey the word of command without

   the use of force. They come to have an understanding of their owner's
   intent and act as if they really entered into their master's designs.
   With the horses and mules of our streets--and of David's day--this is
   not the case. These display little understanding and we are not to be
   like they. You are a reasoning man--act reasonably! You have
   understanding--do not act under mere impulse, blind willfulness, or
   ignorant folly. Here is the point, Brothers and Sisters--what we need
   is to come to an understanding with God and to stay in that condition.
   The horse does not understand his driver's wishes, except as he
   intimates them through the bit and bridle. When he is to turn, when he
   is to quicken his pace and when he is to stand still, he must be told
   through the rein, for, apart from the bit in his mouth, he has no
   understanding of the man's mind.

   That thought which works in the mind of his driver is not working in
   the mule's mind and, therefore, he has to feel a pull at his mouth to
   make him know his master's desire. We need to come to an understanding
   with God. "Be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the
   Lord is." Be sensitive to the Spirit of God! So dwell in God that He
   shall dwell in you and His indwelling shall cause you to feel at once
   what it is that He would have you to do. May your will be so in accord
   with the Lord's will that you will only what He wills! This is the
   highest form of understanding that I know of--may we never rest till we
   have it. "Give me understanding and I shall keep Your Law." You know
   how we say, "I should like to come to some understanding with that
   man," for you feel that without it your relations are unsatisfactory.
   When two friends really understand each other's purpose and enter into
   each other's design, then they act as if they were one. Be you so near
   to God in heart that you can be guided with His eyes because you
   understand the mind of your heavenly Father and are in full sympathy
   with Him!

   But the Psalmist also adds, concerning the horse and the mule, that
   having no understanding, they are creatures with much self-will and
   waywardness. "Their mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
   they come near to you." If you look at the Revised Version, you will
   find it is, "else they will not come near to you." And Calvin has it,
   "lest they kick at you." This is a very obscure passage as to the
   words, but it is not at all doubtful as to its sense, for the point is
   that the animal will not do what it should do, but it will obstinately
   do what it ought not to do--until it gets the bit in its mouth to
   compel it to do its master's will. So is it with ourselves, but so it
   should not be! At one time we find men rashly rushing near to God--they
   have no reverence, no holy trembling and awe. Some appear to be as
   familiar with God as if He were one of them. Thus the Lord complains in
   the Psalm, "You thought that I was altogether such an one as yourself."
   Such vain people need a bit, lest they come near to God. They need to
   hear the voice which cries, "Draw not near here: put off your shoes
   from off your feet." Oh, for more holy reverence!

   Others will not come near to God at all and need a bit because they run
   off from the Lord into infidelity, blasphemy, or open vice. These
   endeavor to carry out their own wild wills, throwing up their heels as
   they please, and prancing over hill and plain with a defiant contempt
   of rule and order. We know that kind of people--let us not in any
   measure grow like they. There are horses and mules that will kick,
   bite, and do grievous harm to these round about them unless they are
   restrained with straps and harness. I am afraid I know some kicking
   saints as well as kicking sinners and I am more afraid of these kicking
   professors than of the outwardly wicked. I would sooner be bitten by a
   wolf than by a sheep, that is to say, I could more readily bear injury
   from an ungodly man than from a professed Believer. A kick from a
   Christian causes very serious wounding to a gracious heart. "It was not
   an enemy: then I could have borne it." Remember the question and
   answer--"What are these wounds in your hands? Those with which I was
   wounded in the house of my friends." These are wounds, indeed, which
   our Lord receives from a traitorous disciple. "Be you not as the horse,
   or as the mule, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
   they kick at you." Kick not at the will of your Lord! Kick not at the
   doctrines of His Word. Kick not at the precepts of His house. Kick not
   at His servants. Kick not at His Providences. Kick not at His Cross.
   Surely, I need not further urge you to avoid this unlovely character.
   None of you would wish to be as the horse, or as the mule.

   III. I will now dwell for a few minutes upon AN INFLICTION TO BE
   ESCAPED. If you mean to be like the horse or the mule, you may readily
   be so, but you will have to pay the penalty. If the Lord means to save
   you, He will use a bit and a bridle upon you, if you render them
   necessary by your willfulness. If you will be guided by His eyes, there
   will be no need for such stern work--but if you are stubborn, He will
   not spare you.

   I may say of this bit and bridle, that such trappings are a curb upon
   freedom. A man would not endure to go about wearing a bit and a bridle,
   yet many a child of God is in that condition spiritually because he is
   not subdued to the will of

   the Lord. Because he is not tender of conscience, because he is
   frequently disobedient, because he does not carry out his Lord's will,
   he has to suffer severe discipline and labor under serious
   disadvantage. If the man were willingly obedient to the Divine will,
   things would go more happily with him.

   The bit is not applied unless it is found necessary, but it will be
   applied if necessary. My text says, "Whose mouth must be held in with
   bit and bridle. Mark that, "must." That must arises out of the nature
   of the creature dealt with. Some men, if they are to go to Heaven, must
   be poor on the road, or must be sick, or must be defeated, or must be
   misunder-stood--not because there is any real necessity, apart from
   their obstinate, cross-grained nature--but because they, themselves,
   render it necessary. God is resolved to save them and, therefore, he
   will drive them to salvation with bit and bridle rather than leave them
   free to rush downward to Hell through the indulgence of their own
   passions and ambitions!

   Dear Friends, what a wretched descent is this from being guided by
   God's eyes! In the first case we have an intelligent servant so in
   accord with his Lord that a look suffices to set him running in the way
   of obedience. And in the second case we have an avowedly Christian man
   so out of accord with God that he has to be treated like a mule which
   will only yield under compulsion and only obey as it is made to smart!
   I do not know, dear Brothers and Sisters, if this description applies
   to any of you, but if it does, kindly take it home--and if I seem to be
   personal to you--well, I intend to be personal and, therefore, I dare
   not apologize. I am afraid that many of us ought to make it more
   personal to ourselves than we are likely to do. There is a hair of the
   mule's tail in every one of us!

   "Be you not as the horse, or as the mule," or you shall have your mouth
   held in with bit and bridle. That is always a very unpleasant matter.
   It is not comfortable, even to a mule, to wear bit and bridle, and it
   certainly must be very unpleasant to a man. I have known Brothers and
   Sisters whom God could not use in the conversion of many souls, for
   they could not bear prosperity. The Lord did bless the preacher, once,
   and he grew so great in his own esteem that he was not bearable to
   these around him. For the man's own sake the good Lord saw that it was
   not safe to let him be useful. Here is a man who formerly succeeded in
   business, but he grew so worldly, so purse-proud, so forgetful of God,
   that it was necessary to take his wealth away from him! And it has been
   done--and now he is devout and lowly.

   Another man, when he is in health and strength, is so full of levity
   and carelessness that he plays the fool. And, in order to keep him
   right, it is necessary to let him have a sluggish liver, or an aching
   head, or a sick home, or something else which may sober him. My Friend,
   if God means to get you to Heaven, He will lead you there gently if you
   will freely go. But if you are obstinate and hard, He will thrust the
   bit between your jaws and drive you there. The less willfulness the
   less harness, but if need be, you shall wear all the paraphernalia of
   an unquiet horse, for the great Trainer will have the upper hand of you
   and thus He will save you! The Lord would be glad for you to go without
   these disagreeable things, but if you will have them, you shall have
   them.

   I know a person who is always grumbling and I do not wonder that he
   always seems to have cause for it. It is like the child that I heard
   crying and its mother said to it, "Hold your tongue! If you cry for
   nothing, I will soon give you something to cry for." Many a child of
   God has found something to cry for as the result of wanton murmuring.
   Some Hearers even go to the House of God and complain that the preacher
   says this, and does not say that, and omits the other. Before long the
   Lord removes the preacher they complained of and they have nobody to
   feed their souls--and then they begin to wish they had the old preacher
   back again! Well, well, if you make rods for your backs, God will use
   them upon you! It is His custom not to let anything lie idle in His
   House. So, if you are busy making a rod, He will be busy in putting it
   to its proper use.

   But all this is unnatural to the child of God. Your children do not go
   about your house with bits in their mouths and bridles on their heads.
   God would not have his own regenerated ones going up and down in the
   world all bitted and bri-dled--but it shall be so sooner than they
   shall be lost! Disobedience is ruin--from that He must deliver His
   people. If we take delight in holiness, we shall not need rough usage.
   Here is the sweet alternative--"I will instruct you and teach you in
   the way which you shall go: I will guide you with My eyes." This is
   God's way! Oh that it may be our way! May the good Spirit lead us into
   it! Do not drive your Savior to be stern with you. Do not choose the
   way of hardness--the brutish way, the mulish way. "Be you not as the
   horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding," for then you will
   become sad, gloomy, dull, stupid and full of disquietude. It is
   essential that your iniquities should be subdued and they shall be. He
   will save you--save you from rebellion, save you from self-seeking and
   self-will. He will bend you to His holy will.

   And if it cannot come to pass anyway else--then the bit and the bridle
   shall conquer you! O Souls, submit yourselves to God. Vex not His Holy
   Spirit by hardness of heart.

   IV. Now I close by noticing A FREEDOM TO BE ATTAINED. There are
   children of God who wear no bit or bri-dle--the Lord has loosed their
   bonds. To them, obedience is delight--they keep His commands with their
   whole heart. The Son has made them free and they are free, indeed!

   They are free, first, because they are in touch with God. God's will is
   their will. They answer to the Lord as the echo to the voice. Happy is
   he who can say, "Whatever You desire, O my Lord, I would desire it
   because You desire it." Then is it safe for the Lord to leave the man
   free from compulsion. It is written, "Delight yourself also in the
   Lord; and He shall give you the desires of your heart." This large
   liberty can only be promised to these whose desires are in accordance
   with their heavenly delight. When the desires run towards God with
   delight, they shall surely be granted. When you and God have come to a
   good, clear understanding with each other, so that you yield to Him in
   all things. Then He will hear your prayers and give you the blessing
   which makes rich and adds no sorrow. When you rejoice in Christ Jesus,
   in whom the Father is well pleased, then will the Lord be pleased with
   you! When you cry to Him in the day of trouble, coming to the Mercy
   Seat, where He delights to dwell, then He will meet with you and lift
   up the light of His Countenance upon you.

   You shall be free, next, because you are tutored. The Lord cannot trust
   our wild nature--He gives freedom where He gives His Spirit--"Where the
   Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." How does our Lord put
   it?--"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly
   in heart: and you shall find rest unto your souls." He gives rest
   through His blood. He makes you find rest through learning of Him and
   bearing His yoke. It is only a horse that has been long taught and
   trained by great skill that can be trusted to go through a performance
   without bit or bridle. I sometimes hope there will come a day when
   these who drive horses will not need to carry whips, because the noble
   animals have been so trained by kindness as to answer to a word. I fear
   that time is a long way off but I have greater hope of you, beloved
   Brothers and Sisters, that you will be so trained that no constraint
   but that of the love of Christ will be needed to be put upon you. The
   Law was not made for a righteous man. I hope we shall not need Church
   discipline, or Providential discipline, because we have been trained to
   joyful, watchful, exact obedience. Oh, that it were so! Teach me, O
   Lord! Teach me Your way. Show me what You would have me to do. Make me
   to know the perfect love which casts out fear. When we are thus
   instructed, the Lord will leave us by His sweet Grace to be encompassed
   about by mercy and to be guided by His eyes.

   We shall be free, again, because always trusting. Look at the 10th
   verse--"He that trusts in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about."
   Faith gives life and more faith gives light and liberty. When we
   completely trust in God, we shall do His will completely. When we raise
   no questions with God--when our reliance upon Him is without reserve;
   when we know by faith that His will and way for us are perfect--then we
   shall run in the way of His Commandments because He has enlarged our
   steps. When we have received life more abundantly through a growing
   faith, it will be safe for our Lord to take away all bits and
   bridles--but not till then. When, through Grace, faith has triumphantly
   mastered our whole being, we shall be victorious over the law of sin
   and death which dwells in our members and tends to unrighteousness. And
   then shall the yoke be taken away and the burden be removed. Blessed
   freedom this!

   Especially free because tender. "Be you not as the horse, or as the
   mule"--these are thick of skin, tough of mouth-- and so they are
   mastered by hard means. If we become as tender as the apple of an eye,
   God will guide us with His eyes. If we avoid even the appearance of
   evil and shun every false way with delicate sensitiveness of mind, we
   shall hear little about bits and bridles and the many other sorrows
   which shall be to the wicked. Ah, dear Brothers and Sisters, what a
   difference there is between one man and another even in the same
   Church, holding the same faith! One Christian man needs repeated and
   urgent warnings, while another is distressed with half a word of
   admonition! It is hard to stir one to generosity, or to any exertion in
   the Lord's cause, while another is earnest at once. Love works more in
   some than fear can produce in others. We have to use strong arguments
   and sharp cuts of the whip with certain sluggish minds, while others
   are all sensitiveness and take to themselves censures which were never
   meant for them.

   Oh for a tender heart! May the heart of stone be taken away and a heart
   of flesh be granted! May we be to the Lord's will as sensitive as the
   mercury to air and heat! The wave is flowing and a cork upon the water
   is carried wherever the current moves. That same wave merely ripples at
   the side of a man-of-war--it does not stir in the least degree. Saintly
   souls feel the ripples of the Holy Spirit, while self-sufficient
   professors know nothing of anything less than a tornado!

   Crave as a choice gift the renewal of a right spirit within you and
   that right spirit will be eminently tender and pliant to the will of
   the Lord. My Brothers and Sisters, my longing is that you and I may
   stand with our faces towards the Lord, watching for the faintest
   indications of the Divine will. May we be humble, teachable and mild!
   May our soul be even as a weaned child!

   All this will lead to high joy. See how the Psalm ends, "Shout for joy,
   all you that are upright in heart"! When the bit is taken from the
   mouth, the tongue will show forth the praises of the Lord! When the
   bridle is gone, the mouth is free to sing to the Most High! If the
   heart is well adjusted, there will be music in the life. When we follow
   the Lord's guidance with alacrity, peace shall be our companion--and
   joy shall hover over us like a guardian angel! This world will be the
   vestibule of Heaven when we begin, even now, to rehearse that perfect
   obedience which is the essential condition of bliss. Beloved, all this
   the Holy Spirit must work in our hearts, or it will never be there. Cry
   to Him for it in the name of Jesus, and the Lord will give you an
   answer of peace!

Believing On Jesus--and Its Counterfeits

   (No. 2191)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 22, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As He spoke these words, many believed on Him. Then said Jesus to
   those Jews which had believed Him, If you continue in My Word, then are
   you My disciples, indeed; and you shall know the truth, and the truth
   shall make you free." John 8:30-32.

   Our Lord, on this occasion, was surrounded by quibblers. We must not be
   astonished if the like should happen to us when declaring the Gospel.
   Our Lord went on preaching, all the same, and He did not conceal
   objectionable Truth because of opposition--say, rather, that He set it
   forth with greater boldness and decision when surrounded by His
   enemies! The more they opposed, the more He testified.

   The Lord Jesus also told the contradicting sinners that the day would
   come when quibblers would be convicted. Observe how He put it--"When
   you have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall you know that I am He,
   and that I do nothing of Myself." Quibblers may have a fine time of it
   just now, but they will, one day, be convicted either to their
   conversion or their confusion! Let us hope that many will see the Truth
   before they die--early enough to seek and find a Savior. But many in
   our Lord's day who discovered it after His uplifting on the Cross and
   His uplifting from the grave, came by their knowledge sadly late, for
   in the meantime they had crucified the Lord of Glory. Ah, how much of
   sin comes out of delayed faith! A far greater number of these Jews were
   convicted in their minds altogether too late, for when they were driven
   to feel, by the attendant circumstances of His Crucifixion and
   Resurrection, that He really was the Son of God, they still persevered
   in rebellion and sank into obstinate rejection of His claims. On such
   His blood rested to their eternal condemnation. Quibblers, you may riot
   for a little season, but your time is short! The hour will come when
   you shall behold and wonder--and perish. I pray that there may come an
   end to your unbelief by your being convicted in this life and led to
   repentance. But if it is not so, you will certainly be ashamed and
   confounded in the day when the Lord shall come in His Glory and you
   shall, in vain, beseech the mountains to fall upon you and hide you
   from His face!

   Quibblers ought to be convinced even now--the Savior implies this when
   He adds, "He that sent Me is with Me: the Father has not left Me alone;
   for I always do those things that please Him." The Character of Jesus
   should have convinced the Jews of His mission. His evident obedience to
   God and the equally evident witness of God to Him, would have led them
   to see His Messiahship if they had not been blinded by prejudice and
   pride. Any candid man at the present day, studying the life of Christ
   and observing His unique Character, should be convinced that He is the
   Son of God--and should come to believe in Him.

   But, Beloved, though the Savior was thus surrounded with objectors and
   had so much to endure from their ignorance and their malice, yet His
   controversies with them were not without hopeful effects, for our text
   informs us, "As He spoke these words, many believed on Him." Albeit we
   may be surrounded with general and virulent opposition, yet there will
   be fruit from the preaching of the Truth of God. The Word of the Lord
   shall not return unto Him void--it shall prosper in the thing whereto
   God has sent it. We may hope that not only a few, but many will accept
   the sacred testimony, since we see that, even in the midst of an
   exceedingly hot dispute, it happened that, "As He spoke these words,
   many believed on Him."

   I. These Believers were not all of one kind and upon that fact I shall
   enlarge in this beginning of my sermon. Let that stand as our first
   observation upon the text--OUR LORD HAD DIFFERENT KINDS OF BELIEVERS
   AROUND HIM. There were evidently two sorts of Believers who may be set
   forth to you by the differing expressions used in the Revised Version.
   We read in verse thirty, "Many believed on Him." And then in the 31st
   verse we read of "those Jews which

   had believed Him." Mark the distinction between, "believed on Him" and,
   "had believed Him." It is a singular expression, also, "Those Jews
   which had believed Him." They were still Jews as to their traditional
   belief and connection-- Jews first of all--whatever they might be in
   connection with their Judaism. The omission of the word, "on," or,
   "in," is a happy one, because it is exactly accurate, and it helps to
   bring out an important distinction while it also accounts for what
   seems so strange, that those who had believed Him should, almost
   immediately after, charge Him with being a Samaritan and having a
   devil, and should even take up stones to stone Him! There were two
   sorts of Believers and on these I will speak a while.

   The first, "believed on Him.''" These are the right kind. What is it to
   believe on Christ? It means not only to accept what He says as true and
   to believe that He is the Messiah and the Son of God, but trustfully to
   rest in Him. To believe on Him is to take Him as the ground of our
   hope, as our Savior, upon whom we depend for salvation. When we believe
   in Him or on Him, we accept Him as God sets Him forth--and we make use
   of Him by trusting on Him to do for us what God has appointed Him to
   do. This trusting on Jesus is saving faith! "As many as received Him,
   to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that
   believe on His name." "He that believes on the Son has everlasting
   life." To believe Him may be a very different thing from believing on
   Him. Such belief may fall far short of saving faith. To believe on Him
   means heartily to give yourself up to Him and to follow Him as the Way,
   the Truth and the Life to you. Rejecting all rival confidences, the
   heart leans all its weight on Jesus and leaves all its burdens with
   Him. Believing in Him, we repose all our concerns, for time and for
   eternity, in His hands.

   To believe on Him is also to believe implicitly. We believe all that He
   may yet say. We accept not only what He says which we can fully
   understand, but that which as yet is dark to us. We so believe in Him
   that we go with Him in all His teachings, be they what they may. We not
   only go as far as He has revealed Himself to us, but we are prepared to
   go as much farther as He pleases. What He says is the Truth of God to
   us, on the sole evidence that He says it! We believe in Jesus, not
   because we judge that what He says can be endorsed by our understanding
   (though that is, indeed, the case), but because He says it! Our Lord's
   Word is reason enough for us. The ipse dixit of the Son of God suffices
   us, even if all men deny His assertions. He has said it and He is the
   Truth of God, itself. We believe on Him--Son of God and Son of Man,
   living, dying, risen again, ascended into the heavens--we trust Him. He
   is our Infallible Prophet and our Omniscient Teacher. We rest ourselves
   wholly on Him! That is saving faith. Oh, that it may be said of this
   congregation, "Many believed on Him"!

   But there is another kind of faith which was produced by the Savior's
   testimony. It had much of hope in it and yet it never came to anything.
   There is a temporary faith which believes Jesus, in a sense, and after
   its own way of understanding Him, or rather of misunderstanding Him.
   This faith believes about Him; believes that He was undoubtedly sent of
   God; that He was a great Prophet; that what He says is, to a high
   degree, reasonable and right and so forth. This faith believes what He
   has just now said, but it is not prepared to believe on Him so as to
   accept everything that He may say at another time. This faith believes
   everything that commands itself to its own judgement--it does not, in
   fact, believe in Jesus, but believes in itself--and in Him only so far
   as He agrees with its own opinions. This faith is not prepared to obey
   Christ and accept Him as its Master and Lord. This was the kind of
   faith these Jews possessed--it was a faith which was so crowded up with
   a mass of favorite prejudices that before long it was smothered by
   them! They might accept Jesus as the Messiah, but then He must be the
   kind of Messiah they had always pictured in their own minds--a leader
   who would defeat the Romans, who would deliver Palestine from the
   foreign yoke, rebuild the Temple and glorify the Jewish race. They half
   hoped that He might turn out to be a great leader for their own
   purposes, but they did not believe in Him as He revealed Himself as the
   Light of the world, as the Son of God and as One with the Father.

   A great deal of disbelief and misbelief is current at the present day.
   We are encouraged by certain persons to include in our churches all
   that have any sort of belief and, indeed, the line is to be more
   inclusive, still, for those who have no belief at all are to find an
   open door! The Church of Christ is to be a menagerie of creatures of
   every kind. I fear if they come into this Noah's ark, wild beasts, they
   will also go out wild beasts. Only those who enter by the door of
   regeneration and spiritual faith will, in very deed, be within the
   Kingdom of the Lord! If they have received Christ, we may receive them
   into His Church, but not else. It is true, the people of temporary
   faith will creep into the visible Church, but they do so on their own
   responsibility.

   Nor need we think that some strange thing has happened to us as a
   Church when the baser sort are found among us, for one such entered
   into that college of Apostles--a man who, doubtless, believed the words
   of Jesus, and thought Him to be the Messiah. I mean Judas, who, with a
   traitor's hand, sold his Master. His intellect had been convinced, but
   his heart had never been renewed. He even dared to use his profession
   of religion and the position which it brought him, as a means of
   unhallowed gain. Another notable believer of this sort was Simon Magus,
   who believed because he saw the signs and wonders worked by the
   Apostles. But as he, also, sought to make gain of godliness, he
   remained in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity--and
   never became "a disciple, indeed." There is a greater one than all
   these, even the devils. We read that "the devils believe and tremble."
   They hold the faith and feel something of the power of it, for they
   tremble which is more than modern critics do! Devils know that Jesus is
   the Christ of God, for they have, upon occasion, confessed it, and have
   borne witness to the Gospel in the open streets, crying after the
   preachers of the Word. And yet, with all their knowledge, and with much
   of a sort of faith, and with an apprehension which leads to trembling,
   they still remain devils and make no advance towards God.

   Ah, my Hearers! Beware of that faith which is a mere intellectual
   movement, which does not control the heart and the life. To come to
   faith through a cold argument and to feel no spiritual life is but a
   poor business. You need a faith that leads you to an entire reliance
   upon the Person of Jesus, to the giving up of everything to Him, to the
   reception of Him as your Savior and King, your All in All. You have not
   believed unto eternal life unless you have so believed on Him that you
   make Him the foundation and cornerstone of your hope! You must believe
   in Him as taking away sin! God has set Him forth to be the Propitiation
   for sin and you must believe on Him in that capacity! This will suffice
   upon our first head--and this very naturally leads us to the second
   remark.

   II. OUR LORD TAKES NOTICE EVEN OF THE LOWEST SORT OF FAITH. When He saw
   that these people believed Him in a measure and were willing to accept
   His testimony so far as they comprehended it, He looked upon them
   hopefully and spoke to them. Out of a weak and imperfect faith,
   something better may arise. Saving faith, in its secret beginnings, may
   be contained in this common and doubtful faith. It is written, "When
   the Son of Man comes, shall He find faith on the earth?" Certainly He
   can find it if anyone can! He has a very quick eye for faith. He deals
   with little faith as we used to do with a spark in the tinder, in the
   days of our boyhood. When we had struck a spark and it fell into the
   tinder--though it was a very tiny one--we watched it eagerly, we blew
   upon it softly and we were zealous to increase it, so that we might
   kindle our match thereby. When our Lord Jesus sees a tiny spark of
   faith in a man's heart, though it is quite insufficient, of itself, for
   salvation, yet He regards it with hope and watches over it, if, haply,
   this little faith may grow to something more. It is the way of our
   compassionate Lord not to quench the smoking flax, nor break the
   bruised reed. If any of you have only a little faith, now, and that
   marred by ignorance and prejudice, it may be like a connecting thread
   between you and Jesus--and the thread may thicken to a cable. Your
   partial and feeble faith as yet only takes hold upon a part of the
   Revelation of God, but I am glad that it takes hold on anything which
   is from above! I would not roughly break that single holdfast which now
   links you to the Truth of God--and yet I would not have you trust to it
   as though it would stand the stress of tempest. Oh, that your faith may
   be increased till you trustfully commit yourself to Jesus and believe
   in Him unto eternal life!

   Our Lord addressed Himself especially to these questionable Believers.
   He turned from His assured disciples to look after those who were more
   in danger. Their character was a curious combination--full of
   peril--"Jews who believed Him." You that are familiar with the New
   Testament Scriptures will think the phrase more suggestive than it, at
   first sight, appears. It reminds me of those of you who believe the
   Gospel and still remain worldly, impenitent, prayerless. You fear the
   Lord and serve other gods! You are not infidels in name, but you are
   atheists in life! To you there is urgent need that I speak. The Master
   turned round and spoke to those who were Believers and yet not
   Believers--holding with Jesus--and yet really opposed to Him. Oh, you
   that halt between two opinions, my Lord looks on you with a pitying
   hopefulness and He speaks especially to you at this time! May you have
   Divine Grace to hear and obey His Word!

   It is clear that He encourages them, but He does not flatter them. He
   says, "if." A great, "if," hovered over them like a threatening cloud.
   Wisely does our Lord commence His word to them with, "if." "If you
   continue in My Word, then are you My disciples, indeed." Continuance is
   the sure test of the genuine Believer. Our Lord does not say, "Go your
   way, you are not My disciples." He, in effect, says, "I stand in doubt
   of you. The proof of your discipleship will be your persevering in your
   faith." If we say that we believe in Jesus, we must prove it by abiding
   in believing and by still further be-

   lieving! The Word of Jesus must be the object of our faith--into that
   Word we must enter--and in that Word we must continue. Beginning to
   believe is nothing unless we continue to believe!

   Our Lord showed His interest in the weaker sort of Believers by helping
   them on in the safe way, urging them to continue in His Word. "You
   believe," He seems to say, "continue to believe! Believe more. Believe
   all that I say. You have entered into My Word--dive deeper into it and
   abide in it. Let My Word surround you--dwell in it--continue in it."
   Good advice this! And it is the advice I would give in my Master's name
   to any here who are feeling after Christ and His Gospel. As far as you
   have already come in faith, keep fast hold and seek for more! You are
   on the right track in believing Jesus--a track which will lead to the
   King's Highway if fairly followed. Any kind of faith is better than
   that deadly doubt which is cried up so much nowadays! By faith comes
   salvation, but by doubt comes the opposite! Your feeble and imperfect
   believing has in it much of hopefulness, but it must be continued, or
   we shall be disappointed. Your home and refuge must be the Word of the
   Lord Jesus and in that refuge you must abide!

   Believe what Jesus says in His New Testament of Love. Whatever you find
   that He reveals by Himself or by His Apostles, receive it without
   question! Hold fast His Word and let it hold you fast. First, believe
   Him, believe Him to be true, believe Him to be sent of God for your
   salvation--and then put yourself into His hands. When you have
   committed yourself to Him, continue to do so. Do not run away from your
   faith because of ridicule. Mind that you so believe in Jesus as to
   practice what He commands--you cannot continue in His Word unless you
   learn to obey it. The text of faith is obedience. What He bids you, do
   it. Let your life be affected by the Truth He teaches. Let your whole
   mind, thought, desire, speech, bearing and conversation be colored and
   savored by your full faith in Jesus! Enter into His Word as a man into
   a stream and live there as a fish in the water!

   "Continue in My word." Get into Christ's Word as a sinking sailor would
   get into a lifeboat and, once there, keep inside the boat--do not throw
   yourself out into the stormy waves through despair--but continue in the
   place of hope. This is Christ's gracious counsel to those in whom there
   seems to be some hopeful sign.

   My Hearers, we never preach the saving power of temporary, unpractical,
   unsanctifying faith! If a man says, "I believe in Christ and,
   therefore, I shall be saved, his faith will have to be tested by his
   life. If, sometime after, he has no faith in Christ, that faith which
   he claimed to have is proven to be good for nothing! The faith of God's
   elect is an abiding faith! It is precious faith and, like precious
   metal, it survives the fire! "Now abides faith, hope, charity, these
   three." Thus true faith is classed among the abiding things--it is
   undying, unquenchable. If you truly believe in Jesus, it is for life!
   Saving faith is a life-long act. It is the relinquishment of all trust
   in self, once and for all, and the trusting in Jesus forever. He is and
   always shall be our only confidence. That is the faith which saves.

   But the temporary faith which comes and goes, is worth nothing. The
   shout of, "I believe it," too often ends when the excitement is over.
   To sing, "I do believe, I will believe," is well enough--but unless
   that believing appertains to daily life and changes the inner
   nature--and abides even till death--it has not saved the man. The
   measure of faith of which we have been speaking may turn out to be the
   beginning of saving faith, but it may, on the other hand, turn out to
   be a mere deception soon to be dispelled--a morning cloud which
   disappears--an early dew exhaled by the sun.

   I think I have said enough upon my second point. Let it encourage you,
   that our Lord takes notice, even of the lowest kind of faith. But let
   it also warn you, when you see that He receives it with an, "if," and
   goes on carefully to exhort and warn, lest the hopeful thing should die
   and its promise should be unfulfilled.

   III. But, next, OUR LORD SETS BEFORE THESE PEOPLE INDUCEMENTS TO
   CONTINUE IN HIS WORD.

   "Jesus therefore said to those Jews which had believed Him, If you
   abide in My Word, then are you truly My disciples, indeed; and you
   shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." Observe three
   inducements, each one of them great--and when placed together
   exceedingly attractive.

   The first was certified discipleship--"Then are you My disciples,
   indeed." That is to say, if they persevered in obeying His Word, they
   would be disciples, not in name only, but in truth. It is a small thing
   to be called Christians, but it is a great matter to truly be
   Christians. Further, they would not be merely superficial learners, but
   deeply taught and inwardly instructed disciples of Jesus. They would
   really and truly know what Jesus taught and would receive it into their
   inmost souls--they would be not untrained beginners in the school of
   Christ, but pupils of the sixth form, "disciples, indeed."

   Dear Friends, it is a great thing to be no longer a probationer, but a
   disciple, indeed! There is more in the expression than I can readily
   set forth in words. A certain person says he is a disciple of Christ,
   but you would never know it if he did not tell you! You might live with
   him for years without hearing an expression or remarking an action
   which is distinctly Christian--this is NOT to be a disciple, indeed!
   Another man loves his Lord and treasures His Words. He puts his
   disci-pleship of Christ before everything--and you cannot live with him
   a single day without perceiving a savor of Christ in his words and
   action. You say of him, "That man is, indeed, a Christian!" In such a
   case, religion is not exhibited by way of pride, as with the Pharisees
   of old, but it is seen because it is there and must shine forth. Faith
   throbs in the man's pulse! It looks out from his eyes. It tunes his
   voice and lights up his countenance! It rules his house and controls
   his business. The man lives for Jesus and if it were necessary, he
   would die for Him. How we prize a thoroughbred Believer! Your mongrel
   is a poor animal. Blessed is he who makes his Master's service his
   pleasure! His Lord's Law is his delight! His Savior's Glory the
   absorbing occupation of his time. He is a disciple, indeed!

   To be a disciple, indeed, creates within the mind a blissful assurance.
   Some are always asking themselves, "Am I truly a disciple?" It is not
   amazing that they ask the question, for it is a great question. But he
   that continues in Christ's Word in loving obedience soon ceases to ask
   that question--he has the witness in himself, or, better still, as some
   read it, he has the witness in Christ. He knows that he is Christ's
   disciple, for he continually follows his Master. He not only believes,
   but he knows that he believes! He has continued in the Word so long
   that he has no doubt about his being in it. How can he doubt, when he
   is, from hour to hour, feeding on the Word in which he lives like a
   mite feasting upon the cheese in which he dwells? He is a disciple,
   indeed, for his deeds are those of a disciple. Oh, you that believe my
   Master at times and up to a certain point, you must go on to believe
   Him more constantly, more thoroughly, more absolutely! May you
   cheerfully stake your souls upon your Lord's veracity! O my Friend, if
   you would find Jesus to be your Savior, surrender yourself to His
   wisdom, yield your whole being to His power! So shall you become a
   disciple, indeed, and be able to claim all the love, care, comfort and
   honor which such a Lord puts on His faithful disciples! May you bring
   forth much fruit-- so shall you be His disciples--and to you shall be
   the double portion which belongs to those who follow the Lamb wherever
   He goes.

   The next blessing which our Lord set before Believers was that of
   sacred knowledge. Observe, "You shall know the truth"--not a truth, but
   the truth--the saving, purifying, glorifying Truth of God! Keep on
   believing and Jesus will teach you that great Truth which is above all
   other truth--essential, quickening, cleansing, Divine! You shall know
   the Truth of God! You may be charged with dogmatism, but you will not
   flinch from the assurance that you know the Truth! You no longer guess
   at Truth, nor hit on a sliding scale of probabilities, but you know it
   assuredly! You will grow familiar with it! The Truth of God will be to
   you a well-known friend! You will discriminate so as to know the Truth
   when you see it and detect it, at once, from the deceptive falsehood.
   You will know the Truth and you will not be led away by the flattering
   voice of error. You will have the touchstone with you and will not be
   deceived by base metals. You will so know the Truth of God as to be
   influenced by it, actuated by it, filled by it, strengthened by it,
   comforted by it and, by its power, you will, yourself, be made true!
   Surely this is a good reason for abiding in Christ's Words!

   The third benefit was spiritual liberty--"The truth shall make you
   free." Our Savior further on explains that He means free from sin. He
   that lives in sin is the slave of sin. Sincere belief in the Word of
   Christ leads to emancipation from the tyrannical power of the evil
   which dwells in our members and from the dominating power of the sin
   which rules in the customs of the world. "The truth shall make you
   free." You shall be free from your own prejudices, prides and lusts.
   You shall be free from the fear of man. If you have sunk so low as
   almost to ask of the great ones permission to breathe, you shall break
   that irksome fetter! The Truth of God known within your spirit shall
   make a free man of you! Up to now you have been the bondsman of self.
   You have enquired, "What will this thing profit me?" And thus the
   desire of self-aggrandizement has ruled everything! But when Jesus is
   your Lord, you shall be free from this sordid motive! "The truth shall
   make you free." This is a noble saying! Oh, the liberty that comes into
   the soul through believing on Jesus, who is the Truth! It makes life to
   be life, indeed, when this freedom is enjoyed! In laying hold on the
   Truth of God as it is in Jesus, the soul lays hold on the charter of
   her liberties and she enters on her citizenship in Heaven!

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, I hope many here enjoy these three
   privileges. Disciples, indeed, you believe anything that is taught to
   you in God's Word, be it what it may. The Truth of God has so entered
   into you that you now know it and are sure. And this believed-Truth has
   made you so free that you defy the fetters which men would cast around
   you! Your

   Lord has caused you to believe in Him and you have now found the
   element wherein your soul may abide in life, light and liberty. Thus
   our Lord dealt with those in whom He saw some hopeful signs--He set
   choice blessings before them to induce them to proceed further.

   IV. But now, fourthly, OUR LORD THUS TESTED THEM BY THE MOST EFFECTUAL
   MEANS. The test was very sharp in its action and sudden in its results.
   He said to them, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make
   you free." And what follows? "They answered Him"--answered Him rather
   than believed Him! How did they answer? Did they say, "Yes, Lord, we
   believe. Teach us Your Truth and make us free"? No, no. They cried, "We
   are Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man--why do You
   say, You shall be made free"? These supposed Believers stumbled at the
   Lord's Word--stumbled at a privilege. Jesus said, "The truth shall make
   you free," and that offended them! To make freedom a stumbling block is
   folly! On another occasion our Lord spoke to His disciples concerning
   eating His flesh and drinking His blood. And then we read, "From that
   time many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with Him." The
   privilege of feeding upon His Sacrifice, which binds many of us to Him
   with bands of love, drove others away from Him with cords of hate! Sad
   fact this!

   But it is so in many ways. I believe that God chose His people from
   before the foundation of the world, I rejoice in the glorious Doctrine
   of Election! But a great many refuse to believe because of this
   heavenly privilege. The privileges of the Gospel are the stumbling
   blocks of legalists! It is too large a Gospel for narrow souls, for, it
   is too glorious a Gospel for groveling intellects. Men refuse the gift
   of God because it is so excellent. If we would cut it down till there
   was nothing left but a more cheese-paring of Grace, I suppose they
   would accept it. But the very Glory of the Gospel which should
   fascinate and attract them, repels and disheartens them!

   The reason why these Jews became so angry with our Lord was that He
   touched their pride. "Make us free, indeed!" they cried. "We always
   were free! We were never slaves. We enjoy the largest rights through
   our father Abraham. We have never come under the dominion of any false
   prophet or idol god. Make us free, indeed! How can You say this?" Thus
   the wild thinker claims that he is free and needs no liberty from
   Christ. The sinner who is in bondage to his passions says that he leads
   a free and easy life and scorns the idea of being set at liberty, as if
   he were a slave! The more a slave a man is to his own conceit or his
   own lusts, the more he talks about his freedom! We would not know that
   he was free if he did not call himself so. Unbelief calls itself,
   "Honest doubt," and not without cause, for we would not have known it
   to be honest if it had not labeled itself so. When a man puts up in his
   shop window, "No cheating practiced here," I should trade next door.
   "He protests too much." Your free love, free thought, free life and so
   forth, are the empty mockery of freedom! Oh, that men knew their
   state--and then freedom would be prized! For lack of self-knowledge,
   the blessings of the Gospel prove an offense when they should have
   hearty welcome.

   The prejudices of the Jews which believed Him were wounded. Oh, how
   often do we find men who will hear the Gospel just so far, and no
   farther! They have not believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. They have not
   entered into His Word so as to be prepared to believe all that He
   teaches and, consequently, when some doctrine is heard which grates
   upon their feelings, or jars on their judgments, or conflicts with
   their original conceptions, straightway they grow angry with their
   Savior! After all, it would seem, from the criticisms which you offer,
   that you know better than the Son of God! Your judgment would seem to
   be clearer than His, for you sit in judgment upon His Word! What is
   Christ to you? Why, He comes before you like the prisoner who stood
   before Pilate. You question Him, as the Roman Governor did when he
   asked, "What is truth?" You believe what you choose to believe and
   disbelieve what you choose to disbelieve! In such a case, who is the
   greater, the disciple or his Master? Surely you presume too much when
   you act as judge of Him who is to be the Judge of all the earth!

   You are no disciple of His! You can never know the Truth and the Truth
   can never make you free, indeed! No blessing can come to you since you
   put yourself out of its way. You may talk about believing, but you have
   not believed, and you cannot be saved by Jesus until you yield your
   judgment to His Infallibility, your heart to His Rule, your every
   faculty to His Grace. Welcome Him as undisputed Lord of your bosom and
   crown Him Lord of All within your soul--such loyal faith He claims and
   this He must have--or you will fall short of His salvation.

   These people soon showed their true character, for very soon afterwards
   they said, "Now we know that you have a devil"--and they took up stones
   to cast at Him! Oh, that we may be delivered from having a faith which
   will end in open rejection of the Lord!

   V. I close with a fifth point--OUR LORD DESERVES OF US THE HIGHEST FORM
   OF FAITH--yes, the highest degree of faith which is possible! Would you
   mind looking in your Bibles into the next chapter, which fitly follows
   the present one? It contains the story of the man blind from his birth,
   to whom the Savior gave sight. Let me read a description of the kind of
   faith which I desire for you all. "Jesus heard that they had cast him
   out; and when He had found him, He said to him, Do you believe on the
   Son of God? He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I might believe
   on Him? And Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him and it is He that
   talks with you. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped Him."
   That is the faith which saves--the faith which learns of Jesus from
   Jesus--hears and believes, and takes Jesus to be its God! The faith
   which bows at the feet of Jesus and worships Him as Divine is the faith
   which saves!

   Men will not do this till their eyes have been opened. While they say,
   "We see," their sin remains and their blindness, too. Only he who can
   say, "One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see," will
   worship Jesus with all his heart. The gracious Lord has come and
   touched my sightless eyes and given me heavenly sight and, therefore, I
   trust Him! I, that could see nothing at all, have seen Him! I, that had
   no idea of what light was, for I was born blind, I have seen the light
   through Him and I both believe and adore! Oh, for a worshipping
   faith--faith on its knees in the Presence of the Son of God! Faith
   beholding Jesus with the eyes which He has opened!

   "Alas," says one, "I wish I had that faith." Listen, then, that you may
   find it. Faith comes by hearing. When I meet with converted persons, I
   like them to tell me what text was blessed to them, for then my mind
   runs on that text. I have sometimes asked a convert, "What part of the
   sermon was it that God blessed to you? Because I would like to repeat
   that passage more than once or twice. I would like to "tell it o'er and
   o'er again." Perhaps the Lord would bless it to another, and another.
   Think, then, what part of our Lord's sermon was it that brought faith
   to those many who believed on Him? I think it was the 28th and 29th
   verses.

   In verse 28 the Lord spoke of His death and all that went with it, and
   all that came out of it--"When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then
   shall you know that I am He." How did they lift Him up? They lifted Him
   up on the Cross--it alludes to His Crucifixion. But they did not know
   that in another sense they lifted Him up--it was through His death that
   there was a possibility of His Resurrection! And when He rose again and
   ascended up on high, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the
   Church--and He entered into Heaven to make intercession for us--and all
   this was emphatically a lifting up!

   The Cross and its surroundings remain, to this day, the great arguments
   for our holy faith. The things that should lead men to believe on Jesus
   Christ are found at His Cross. He was the Son of God, but He died the
   death of the Cross for love of men. Being dead and buried, His Father
   raised Him from the dead and thus gave evidence of His mission and of
   His acceptance with God. There is no question about His
   Resurrection--it is proved beyond all doubt that Jesus rose again from
   the dead on the third day. His disciples saw Him for the space of 40
   days and ate and drank with Him--and then they beheld Him go up into
   Heaven till a cloud received Him out of their sight. They waited at
   Jerusalem and the Holy Spirit came upon them in cloven tongues, the
   Divine testimony to His ascended power! By the preaching of His Word in
   the power of the Holy Spirit, the nations were made to hear concerning
   Jesus, the Savior, and bowed before His Cross.

   Now, the more you think of this unique occurrence--this fact which
   could not have been a piece of imagination, this fact which was
   attested by honest men, who bled and died for it--the more you think of
   this, I say, the more you will feel faith stealing over your spirit!
   Christ on the Cross is thought to be hard to believe in, but it is not
   so, for the more you know of a Crucified Christ, the more easy will
   faith become! Christ raised to the Crown by His Cross is the great
   breeder of faith! Christ rising from the dead is a marvel, yet it is
   the keystone of the arch of faith. Believe it! Christ gone into
   Glory--the Son of God bearing His Manhood into the highest place of
   supreme sovereignty and pleading there for guilty men--think much of
   this Truth of God and you will find faith come to you, for "faith comes
   by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." Especially is faith
   begotten and nourished by that part of God's Word which treats of the
   Cross and the Crown--the double lifting up of Jesus!

   Also, once more, and I have done--you will find faith much helped by
   looking to the life of Jesus set forth in the Gospels. Read the verse,
   "He that sent Me is with Me: the Father has not left Me alone, for I
   always do those things that please Him." What a perfect life is that of
   Jesus! Could it have been invented? He who could have sketched it from
   his imagination must, himself, have been perfect. But, then, no perfect
   man could have been guilty of a forgery. Jesus was

   obedient to the Father in all things and yet He put no force upon
   Himself in so doing--it was natural to Him to be holy. It was His meat
   and His drink to do the will of Him that sent Him, and to finish His
   work. And the God of Heaven, by His miracles, was with Him and bore
   witness to Him.

   There is no superfluous miracle recorded in the Gospels--they are all
   necessary evidence, such as was called for in that court wherein the
   Perfection, the Messiahship, the Deity of our Lord were tried. If you
   read His whole life through till you come to His death, and even study
   that death in which the Father hid His face from Him as to the
   enjoyment of His smile, you can see that God was always with His Son
   Jesus, working out His Divine purposes by Him and bearing witness to
   Him. God is in accord with Jesus, that is clear. He is with Him even
   now! Nobody can doubt that there are such things as conversions, for
   they are common phenomena in every living Church of God. And
   conversions are God's testimony to the Word of Jesus and the proofs
   that the Father and the Holy Spirit are working with the Son.

   Think of this, and then yield to the Son of God, since God bears
   witness of Him to you! Come along with you, you that have had other
   notions. Come and take Jesus to be your Light and Life! You that have
   had other confidences, leave them all and believe on Him, for He is
   worthy of your utmost confidence. You that have been hesitating,
   believe in Jesus once and for all! You that have been procrastinating,
   come this very day and listen to that voice which shall at once set you
   free! Oh, that you would now trust Jesus, my Lord and my God! May the
   good Spirit help you, now, to believe on the Crucified One and may this
   be another of those occasions concerning which it shall be written in
   the Book of Record, "Many believed on Him"! God grant it, for our Lord
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--John 8:12-59.

The Joyous Return

   (No. 2192)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 1, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "O Israel, return unto the Lordyour God; for you have fallen by your
   iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto Him, Take
   away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the
   calves of our lips. Ashur shall not save us, we willnotride upon
   horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, You are
   our gods: for in You the fatherless find mercy." Hosea 14:1-3.

   We are in the last chapter of the book of the Prophet Hosea. Throughout
   the book there has been thunder-- sometimes a low rumbling, as of a
   distant tempest--sometimes peal on peal, as of a storm immediately
   overhead. And now the tempest has gathered all its force. Here it
   culminates. You expect the bolt of Heaven to destroy. Lo, instead
   thereof, a silver shower of mercy! The gentle drops come down
   plenteously and you hear them fall upon the tender herb like soft and
   low music. God does not say, "O Israel, depart accursed!" But instead
   thereof, in dulcet tones He cries, "O Israel, return unto the Lord your
   God." In the midst of wrath He remembers mercy--

   "When God's right arm is bared for war, And thunders clothe His cloudy
   car," even then He stays His uplifted hand, reins in the steeds of
   vengeance, and holds communion with Grace--"for His mercy endures
   forever," and, "judgment is His strange work."

   To use another figure--the whole book of Hosea is like a great trial
   wherein witnesses have appeared against the accused and the arguments
   and excuses of the guilty have been answered and baffled. All has been
   heard for them and much, very much, against them--and the convicted
   stand at the bar to hear their sentence. Behold the Judge, instead of
   putting on the black cap to pronounce doom of death, stretches out His
   hands to the condemned and, in tones of pity, cries, "O Israel,
   return"!

   This is a wonderful chapter to be at the end of such a book. I had
   never expected, from such a prickly shrub, to gather so fair a flower,
   so sweet a fruit! But so it is--where sin abounded, Grace does much
   more abound! No chapter in the Bible can be more rich in mercy than
   this last of Hosea and yet no chapter in the Bible might, in the
   natural order of things, have been more terrible in judgement! Where we
   looked for the blackness of darkness, behold a noontide of light!

   While I am preaching from such a text, I feel the need of special help
   from the Holy Spirit. I lift up my heart for it. Will you not, my
   Brothers and Sisters, pray for me, that my Hearers may not only hear my
   voice, but may perceive the inward voice of God speaking to their
   hearts? The Lord Himself is the speaker of the text--it is Jehovah who
   says, "O Israel, return." May many of you hear the voice of God and in
   that voice perceive an over-powering Omnipotence which shall turn your
   thoughts and souls into the right way, making you willing in the day of
   His power!

   I ask you to consider, first, the call to come to God--"O Israel,
   return unto the Lord your God." And, secondly, the argument for
   coming--"For you have fallen by your iniquity." Thirdly, we shall dwell
   upon the help in coming which the Lord gives to those who are willing
   to obey. He says, "Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto
   Him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously." In conclusion,
   we shall pray to see in many the coming by this help. May my
   unconverted Hearers return unto the Lord, and know the power of His
   restoring Grace!

   I. First, notice THE CALL TO COME--"O Israel, return unto the Lord your
   God." Oh, that the call may be made effectual this day!

   It is a very instructive call, for it tells the sinner exactly what he
   has to do. Return--that is, reverse your course! The course you have
   taken is the opposite of that which you ought to have taken. Therefore,
   come back. You have gone from God--come back to God! You have been
   prayerless--begin to pray! You have been hardened--yield to the Word.
   You have been full of quibbling--believe even as a little child! Bring
   forth fruits meet for repentance and not the fruits of obstinate
   persistence in evil. To many there could be no better direction in
   spiritual morals than this word, "Return." Do what you have not
   done--leave undone what you have been doing! Reverse the original. Take
   the other track! "Return!" is but a single word, but that word is full
   of meaning. There is to be a change, a total change, a coming back to
   God.

   The word is also instructive because it says, Return unto the Lord." Do
   not only look to God, but return to Him. Arise and go to your Father.
   Do not think about it, but do it! Do not return part of the way to this
   and to that good custom and salutary habit, but come right back to the
   Lord and rest not till you feel that you are in His arms. It is of no
   use for the prodigal to say, "I will arise," unless he adds, "and go to
   my father." It is of no use his quitting one far-off country for
   another! But it must be said of him, "And he arose and came to his
   father." The best direction we can give to many a sinner is--Reverse
   your course of life and let your reversed course of life lead you to
   God, Himself. How surely will he need the abounding Grace of God for
   such a work as this! Virgil's lines are true--

   "The gates of Hell are open night and day. Smooth the descent and easy
   is the way. But to return and seek the upper skies, In this the task
   and mighty labor lies." The call is very practical. It does not ask for
   sentiment, but for action--"O Israel, return unto the Lord your God."
   Do not, as I have said before, merely think of it, but resolutely and
   thoughtfully return! Do not speculate about when you will do it--let it
   be done now! Procrastinate no longer--quit halting and hesitating, once
   and for all. Cease to count the loss or the gain of it, but take the
   decisive step--"O Israel, return."

   I cannot help reminding you that this instructive and practical
   exhortation is also a very pathetic call. The "O," with which it
   commences is not used as an oratorical embellishment. Loving entreaty
   breathes in it. He who speaks is in earnest and pleads with all His
   heart. It is God, Himself, who says, "O Israel, return unto the Lord
   your God." It is not a chill command--cold and sharp, like the sword of
   the Lord in the day of doom. But, albeit, it has all the force of a
   command--it is a warm and tender entreaty from the lips of Love--"O
   Israel, return." In that, "O," I seem to hear at once the weeping of
   the Lord Jesus, the sounding of the heart of the great Father and the
   grieving of the Holy Spirit, "O Israel, return" is a sorrowful, tender,
   gentle, wooing voice which I beseech you to regard. Possibly some of
   you may have had to plead with one of your own children who has been
   very willful and has threatened to do that which would have been
   exceedingly injurious to him. You have said, "Oh, do not so, my Son!
   Oh, do not so, my Daughter!" And you have thrown your soul into your
   pleading. Even thus does God, with sacred pathos, with love welling up
   from the depth of His heart, plead with every sinner before me! And He
   words the pleading thus--"O Israel, return unto the Lord your God."

   I would remind you, also, that, pathetic as it is, it is a Divine call.
   "O Israel, return!" Who says it? The Prophet? Yes, but more than the
   Prophet--He who pleads is the Prophet's God. The first motion towards
   reconciliation is never from the sinner, but always from God. The
   sinner does not cry, "O Lord, my God, permit me to return"--no, but the
   Lord, Himself, who watches the wandering one and sees him falling to
   his ruin, cries out, in the freeness of His Grace, "O Israel, return!"
   What matters it to the Lord though a man should even plunge down to
   Hell? The Lord will be glorious, though the rebel perishes! The Lord
   has no need of men. Yet the Lord thinks much of wandering men and longs
   for their return. Out of the freeness and riches of His love, He calls
   them to Himself. He swears by His own life that He wills not the death
   of the sinner, but that he turn to Him and live. Because of His
   spontaneous love and pity, He cries, plaintively, "O Israel, return
   unto the Lord your God." Listen, then, my Hearers! If it were my call,
   you might refuse it with small blame--but it is God's call--shall your
   Maker call in vain? Will you add to all your sin, the turning of your
   back upon the God of Love? Shall Jehovah cry in pity to your souls and
   cry in vain? God grant it be not so! Here from this text, which, once
   written, remains, there sounds out of the eternal deep of boundless
   mercy this cry of Divine Grace--"O Israel, return unto the Lord your
   God!"

   And so I will say no more about this call except that it is evidently a
   very gracious one. He puts it so, "Return unto the Lord your God." If
   you, O Sinner, will return to the Lord, He will be your God! He will
   enter into covenant with you. He will give Himself over to you to be
   yours. Henceforth you shall have a property in Jehovah and all the
   wealth of His infinite Nature shall be yours. You shall be able to say,
   "This God is our God forever and ever: He will be our guide even unto
   death." That man has made a great speech who has truly said, "God is
   mine." There is more in calling God our God

   than if we could hold the title-deeds of both the Indies, or claim
   possession of the stars! God, in the infinity of His Grace, declares,
   "I will be their God."

   I cannot preach as I would. Who can compass such a theme as this? Oh,
   that you were wise, that you knew what was good for you! Then would you
   answer to this call. O Sinner, how I wish that you were delivered from
   your madness! Then you would no longer turn your back upon your own
   blessedness, nor would you any longer reject the Lord your God to your
   own confusion. Your present course will lead you down to utter and
   entire destruction --therefore, pause, I pray you! No, I say more! Do
   not stay where you are, but return, return at once! See you not what a
   welcome God will give you? He says not, "Return unto your Judge," but,
   "Return unto your God." It is not written, "Return like an escaped
   prisoner to your jailer, return to the whip and to the stocks," but,
   "Return unto the Lord your God." This God shall be your exceeding joy!
   Albeit I cannot put my soul into such words as I could wish, I am sure
   that men who are wise and prudent will think upon these things and will
   be led to seek after the Lord, from whom all blessings flow. I remember
   how, when I perceived the freeness and preciousness of the Gospel, I
   ran towards it, being drawn that way by a strong desire for that which
   promised such great things to me! May many a man and woman out of the
   present company say, "I will answer to the Divine entreaty. Jehovah
   bids me return and return I will"!

   II. Secondly, I beg you to notice THE ARGUMENT FOR COMING. "Return unto
   the Lord your God; for you have fallen by your iniquity." What a
   wonderful argument is this! You are in an evil plight through sin,
   therefore return to the Lord your God. "But," says one, "I was afraid I
   might not come because I had fallen." See how your fear is anticipated?
   The case is reversed and your having fallen is made by the Lord into an
   argument why you should return to Him! "I am broken-down," says one. "I
   have fallen so badly that I shall never be worth a penny for any good
   work." Yet the Lord cries, "Return, for you have fallen." I hear one
   moaning, "I am broken to pieces by sin--I am like an old pot that has
   fallen on the stones. I am useless." For that very reason the Lord of
   Mercy bids you return! "Return unto the Lord your God; for you have
   fallen." What ingenuity of mercy there is in the heart of God! See, He
   takes away the reason for despair and makes an argument for hope out of
   it! Because you are thus fallen, you have need to return--and God
   considers your need, not your merit! Because you are fallen, God's pity
   invites you to return. Use the word, "fallen," literally. If you are a
   fallen man, return! If you are a fallen woman--return! Why is it that
   the word, "fallen," has a force in reference to woman which it has not
   in regard to man? Surely a fallen man is as sad a sight as a fallen
   woman! But whether male or female, here is the argument for your
   returning to God--"You have fallen; therefore return." I pray you,
   yield to so gracious a plea!

   Dear Friends, the argument is also this--the cause of your evil plight
   is sin. "You have fallen by your iniquity." Sin is the root of the
   mischief. Do not say, "I was fated to be so." "You have fallen by your
   iniquity." It is true that you have fallen in Adam, but you have also
   fallen by your own actual sin, and you have enough to do to confess
   your own act and deed. Your own willful omissions and commissions have
   ruined you! You are wounded, but your own hand has given the injurious
   stab. "You have fallen by your iniquity"--blame no one or nothing else!
   That you are an unbeliever is your own fault--you will not come to
   Christ that you might have life. The way you follow is the way of your
   own choice--in which you follow the imaginations and devices of your
   own heart. All the misery of your present estate is due to yourself. "O
   Israel, you have destroyed yourself! Feel that it is so and confess it
   before God, taking to yourself shame and confusion of face.

   The only remedy for your evil case is to come back to God. If you have
   fallen by your iniquity, you must be set free from this iniquity--but
   you cannot free yourself. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots?" You have lain in the lye of evil till you are dyed
   ingrain with the scarlet of iniquity--and the color cannot be taken out
   except by a miracle of Divine Grace! Only God can take away the spots
   from the leopard, and the blackness from the Ethiopian, and the crimson
   from the deep-dyed wool! The Lord and only the Lord can work these
   marvels. Therefore you are called upon to "return unto the Lord your
   God," for your only hope of restoration lies in God, Himself!

   Your guilt should not make you hesitate, for the Lord knows all about
   it, and His invitation shows that He does so. He says, "Return; for you
   have fallen." O my Hearer, have you tried to hide that fall? Are you
   sitting here and trying to forget your ruin? The Lord does not forget
   it and does not wish you to forget it! He sets it before your mind and
   bids you come to Him as a fallen person. The Lord Jesus Christ receives
   sinners as sinners. He does not want them to change their character and
   then come, but they are to come to Him for a change! Come simply as
   sinners--not as awakened sinners, or

   sensible sinners, or sinners with some other good qualification. As
   sinners come to Him who has come to save sinners! The Lord Jesus gave
   Himself for our sins--He never gave Himself for our righteousness and,
   therefore, He would have us come to Him in all our defilement. Come in
   your evil habits, your guilt, your condemnation, your spiritual death
   and your corruption! Come just as you are. He delights in mercy--leave
   space for mercy to work. "Return," He says, "for you have fallen by
   your iniquity."

   If you are in the worst case that any mortal was in, you have the best
   possible Helper to whom you are to return. If you go to Gilead for balm
   for your wound, you would turn that way in vain, for to the question,
   "Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there?" the answer
   is, of course, there is neither balm nor physician there, or else the
   hurt of the daughter of My people would long ago have been healed. You
   have gone enough to Gilead, now go to God! Human sources of help must
   fail you and for that very reason we would persuade you to turn to God.
   There is no physician in Gilead, therefore, come along with you to Him
   whose touch is better than balm, who is, Himself, the health of souls.
   The very hem of His garment overflows with power, so that a touch will
   heal you!

   Jesus has but to cast an eye on the most guilty and forlorn, and they
   live. Yes, if they do but cast an eye on Him, they receive eternal
   life! A legion of devils will flee at His word. Oh, what a blessing it
   is that there is such a mighty Savior! If anybody here perishes, it is
   not because the Savior is not able to save him. If any man here shall
   die in his sin, it can only be accounted for by the Savior's
   declaration, "If you believe not that I am He, you shall die in your
   sins." "He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
   Him." "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin." How
   intensely do I pray that you may return to God, urged by these reasons,
   namely, that you are helplessly, hopelessly lost--and Christ is a
   mighty Savior--on whom your help is laid! I would that for this reason
   you would come to Him, even this very day! He will receive you even
   now, for He has said it--"He that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast
   out."

   III. Now let us see how our gracious God meets us and provides for us
   THE HELP IN COMING.

   The Lord helps our ignorance and our fear. He gives us direction as to
   what to bring. Read the second verse. "Ah!" says the sinner, "I do not
   know what to take with me in approaching the Most High. I have no
   bullocks, no lambs, no incense. In my hand there is no price of money
   or merit." The answer is, "Take with you words." Your heart is right;
   you are longing for salvation; you need not say, "How shall I come
   before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God?" "Take with you
   words"--you have plenty of them. The heart must be there, first, and
   then nothing more is asked than, "words." Cheap enough is this
   offering! Leaves of the forest are not so easy to come at. This is
   simple enough--He that has a tongue can bring words!

   O man and woman, whatever else you cannot bring, you can bring words,
   for, indeed, you have multiplied words to sin! The Lord helping you to
   return, you need not hesitate for need of an offering, since He says,
   "Take with you words." This is but another version of our grand hymn--

   "Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling. Naked, come
   to You for dress, Helpless, look to You for Grace. Foul, I to the
   Fountain fly-- Wash me, Jesus, or I die!"

   And then, the Lord helps the coming sinner by a direction as to where
   to turn. "Take with you words, and turn to the Lord." "I need to see
   the minister," says one. Turn to the Lord! "I desire to converse with a
   man of God." Turn to the Lord! We read in the book of Job, "To which of
   the saints will you turn?" My answer would be--Sinner, turn to the
   sinner's Friend and leave the saints alone! If you would be saved, turn
   not to Peter, nor James, nor John--but turn to Him whom all these call,
   "Master and Lord!" "Take with you words, and turn to the Lord." Have
   you been in the habit of turning to a man who is called a priest? I
   pray you, do so no longer, for there is now but one sin-atoning Priest,
   and He is the Lord Jesus! Have you turned to ceremonies? Do you look
   for rest in sacraments? You look that way in vain, for they are not the
   way of salvation! Turn, rather, to the Lord as He is revealed in the
   Lord Jesus! Take with you words and turn to the Lord, Himself. Against
   Him you have sinned--to Him make confession. You need that His anger
   should be turned away. Seek, then, a free forgiveness from Him! It is
   His love that you need--go to Him for it and He will receive you
   graciously--and love you freely!

   A further help is this. The Lord helps us to return to Him by giving a
   direction how to pray. A minister said to me last Thursday evening what
   I have often felt to be true--"We had need make coming to Christ very
   plain, for many people are so ignorant that they almost need to have
   the words of confession and faith put into their mouths. They need
   somebody to kneel down, side by side with them, and utter the very
   words that they should speak unto the Lord." There is much more truth
   in this statement than inexperienced persons may think. So here the
   Lord does, as it were, put the words into the sinner's mouth. "Take
   with you words, and say unto Him." He says the words, that the sinner
   may make them His own, and say them after Him! In this condescending
   style He teaches the returning sinner how to pray. What a gracious God
   He is!

   Suppose a case. A great king has been grievously offended by a
   rebellious subject, but in kindness of heart he wills to be reconciled.
   He invites the rebel to sue for pardon. He replies, "O King, I would
   gladly be forgiven, but how can I properly approach your offended
   majesty? I am anxious to present such a petition as you can accept, but
   I know not how to draw it up." Suppose this great king were to say, "I
   will draw up the petition for you"? What confidence the supplicant
   would feel in presenting the petition! He brings to the king his own
   words! He prays the prayer he is bid to pray! By the very fact of
   drawing up the petition, the monarch pledged himself to grant it!

   O my Hearer, the Lord puts it into your mouth to say this morning,
   "Take away all iniquity." May you find it in your heart to pray in that
   fashion! That prayer is best which is offered in God's own way and is
   of God's own prompting! May you present such a prayer at once!

   Here I find two sentences of petition. The first is--"Take away all
   iniquity." Follow me and try to pray this prayer, "O You that takes
   away the sin of the world, take away all my iniquity. It is great, but
   pardon it, I pray You, for You did bear our sins in Your own body on
   the tree. By Your precious blood, wash away all my iniquity! Let me
   know that You have carried my transgression away, even as the scapegoat
   carried the sins of Israel into the wilderness of forgetfulness. Take
   away all iniquity by an act of pardon, I beseech You. Take it away,
   also, in another sense--Lord, take it out of my heart; take it out of
   my life."

   Dear Seekers, I pray you, do not look on one sin and say, "Lord, spare
   it!" Do not wish to have one sin left, but cry, "Take it away! Take it
   away! Take away all iniquity. However sweet, or fascinating, or deeply
   seated, Lord, take away all iniquity. If I have been given to the
   intoxicating cup, take it away! If I have been the slave of greed, take
   it away! If I have been subject to passion, or pride, or lustfulness,
   take it away! Whatever is my besetting sin, 'take away all iniquity'!"
   Do you wish to have one fair sin spared? It will be your ruin! Hew in
   pieces that Agag sin that comes so delicately. Let your cry be, "Take
   it away!" The taking away of it may cost you a right hand or a right
   eye, but still, shrink not, but cry, "Take away all iniquity." Have
   done with it all. It will be of no use to give up one poison. If you
   take another poison, it will kill you. All sin must go, or else all
   hope is gone! Return to God, but it must be with a prayer which shows
   that you and your sins have fallen out, never to be reconciled.

   The next petition is, "Receive us graciously." Confess that a kind
   reception of you by God must be of Grace alone. Nothing but Divine
   Grace can open a door for our returning. Sinners cannot be received of
   the Lord on any other terms but those of mercy. We would not ask to be
   dealt with according to our merits, but we thank the Lord that He has
   not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities. As to our sins, we cannot answer Him one of a thousand. The
   Lord must receive us graciously or reject us righteously. Are we not
   glad that sinners can be received in the name of Grace and find a
   welcome in the tender mercy of our God? Offer, then, this petition,
   "Receive us graciously." I am not merely content to talk to you about
   these gracious words--I want every soul here to use them in personal
   prayer. Oh, that the Lord would touch all lips, by His Grace, and lead
   them to say from the heart--"Lord, receive me. I return to You. Take
   away all iniquity and take me to Yourself! Receive me as a subject of
   Your Kingdom. Receive me, by Your Grace, into Your home of love.
   Receive me into the family of Your redeemed on earth and then receive
   me into Your mansion in Heaven. 'Receive us graciously.'"

   These are two sweet petitions and they are fitly framed together. May
   the Holy Spirit constrain every heart to present them! May these be the
   words which every one of you shall take with him in returning to the
   Lord!

   One sentence of promise follows these two of petition--"So will we
   render the calves of our lips." What are the "calves of our lips"? They
   are sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving! Yonder are the calves of the
   stall which men bring in sacrifice--they are struck down and they die
   at the altar. God does not ask us for bullocks which have horns and
   hoofs!

   He takes no pleasure in the blood of calves, or of goats. He desires a
   broken heart, true faith and humble love--these live at the altar.
   "Whoso offers praise, glorifies God." Let us bring Him our best
   thoughts, our best expressions, our best testimonies, our heartiest
   praises! These are not calves of our stalls, but, "calves of our lips."
   Let our gratitude be a living sacrifice and our conduct a constant
   testimony to the goodness of God. I think we can say, this morning--at
   least, I can--"Lord, if You will spare me, I will speak for You." I
   must do so during the rest of my life, or else I shall have to change
   my ways and habits. I was thinking, as I came along this morning, that
   it is somewhere about 40 years since I first opened my mouth to preach
   for Christ and I can still say what I have often said--

   "Ever since by faith I saw the stream

   His flowing wounds supply,

   Redeeming lo ve has been my theme,

   And shall be till I dee."

   Is there not some young man here who will begin at once to take up this
   service for the next 40 years? I wonder what young man it is that I may
   lay hands upon for Jesus? And some Christian woman--no, she is not a
   Christian, yet, but I call her such, for she is going to be--I am only
   anticipating a little--will she not now become a Christian and
   straightaway render unto the Lord Jesus the calves of her lips, by
   bearing her testimony to her family and among her acquaintances? Who
   will consecrate himself, this day, unto the Lord? While you cry to God
   for mercy as to the past, resolve that if you are saved, you will
   confess His name and so offer Him the calves of your lips! The Lord
   claims your hearts, first, and your lips next! You must confess Christ
   before men! Salvation is promised to a confessed faith--always remember
   that-- "He that with his heart believes, and with his mouth makes
   confession of Him shall be saved." "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." Faith should be confessed in God's own way, by
   Baptism, and to that faith the promise is specially given.

   Though I doubt not that some may be saved who do not make an open
   avowal of their faith, yet the promise runs as I have quoted it and I
   would not have you willfully forget the command implied in it. "He that
   confesses Me before men, him will I confess before My Father who is in
   Heaven"--so says the Lord Jesus. It is no more than His due, that we
   should take up our cross and follow Him. It is but a small thing, that
   if we trust in His name, we should bear His name! So you see, the Lord
   puts into our mouths, this morning, this resolve, that we will praise
   Him. "So will we render the calves of our lips."

   Now come three sentences of renunciation--"Ashur shall not save us. We
   will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more to the work of
   our hands, You are our gods." First, the natural, legal trust, so much
   esteemed among men, must go. Israel always used to fall back upon
   Assyria. If Egypt threatened the people, or if any other nation
   oppressed them, they sent a present to the King of Assyria to come and
   deliver them. But now they cry, "Ashur shall not save us!" The popular
   trust of the world is in self-righteousness in its various forms. You
   were going to be saved by your own repentance, reformation and future
   well-doing--but of this you must say--"Ashur shall not save us." Are
   you trusting in sacraments? Give up so vain a confidence! They are not
   meant to save, but to instruct those who are already saved! Are you
   trusting in your hereditary godliness, your birthright religion? Away
   with so poor a foundation! Are you trusting in your prayers, your
   giving to the poor, your attendance on sermons, your honesty, your good
   nature? Set these on one side, and cry, "Ashur shall not save us!" All
   confidences must go except Jesus Christ, whom God has laid in Zion for
   a foundation stone. On Him must we build and on no other, for, "Ashur
   shall not save us."

   But, next, they gave up all carnal confidence of their own--"neither
   will we ride upon horses." The kings of Israel were forbidden to
   multiply horses because they were not used in commerce, but only for
   military purposes, and Jehovah would not have His people rely upon
   these creatures. Egypt might glory in horse and chariot, but Israel
   must not do so. Hence we find pious Hezekiah keeping this Law so
   strictly that Rabshakeh reviled him by offering to send 2,000 horses if
   he could set riders upon them. When we come to God, we must quit all
   trust in ourselves of every sort--in our tears, our prayers, our moral
   life, our excellent instincts--or anything else. "Some trust in horses
   and some in chariots, but we will remember the name of the Lord our
   God." It may be you have fine horses of morality and religiousness; you
   have many virtues upon which you think you might fairly depend--give up
   these trusts! Have you been lately trotting out your horses before your
   own family and saying to your wife, "I am not like many men. I never
   drink too much, neither do I treat my household unkindly"? Put away
   these horses! You cannot come to God riding in pride. Say, "We will not
   ride upon horses." Put away every confidence in yourself, in whatever
   fashion it appears.

   One more stroke of renunciation remains. Down must go the gods of our
   former estate. He that would come to the true God must have done with
   the false gods! If we have been living for any objectives but the Glory
   of God, we must do away with those objectives. If we have been paying
   religious reverence to anything but God, Himself, we must do away with
   it. "Neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, You are our
   gods." It seems strange that men should ever have said such a thing,
   but since they have said it, they must say it no more. God help
   everyone here to now make a complete renunciation of everything which
   usurps the place of God! Whether it is an object of trust, reverence,
   desire, fear, or love, we must cast it down and worship only God. He
   says to us, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth:
   for I am God, and there is none else." In the work of salvation, the
   work of our hands is out of court! Only God must be glorified.

   The words close with one sentence of faith. My time fails me, and I
   cannot dwell upon it at length. "In You the fatherless find mercy."
   Dear orphan boys below me, here is a word for you! Remember it and love
   God because it is true-- "In You the fatherless find mercy." God is the
   Father of the fatherless! Now, if God receives the fatherless, who have
   none to take care of them, and He becomes their God, we may be
   encouraged to come to Him, even in the most forlorn condition. Does God
   keep open house for those who have no home? Then I will go to Him! Does
   God take up those whom father and mother have forsaken? Then will I put
   my trust in Him! I saw on a board this morning words announcing that an
   asylum was to be built on a plot of ground for a class of persons who
   are described in three terrible words-- HELPLESS, HOMELESS, HOPELESS.
   These are the kind of people that God receives--to them He gives His
   mercy! Are you helpless? He will help you! Are you homeless? He will
   house you! Are you hopeless? He is the Hope of those who have no other
   confidence. Come, then, to Him at once!

   IV. This last word should induce sinners to return to God and then we
   shall see before our eyes THE COMING BY THIS HELP. You that are great,
   good, full and inwardly strong, you will not return to God. You that
   are nothing and less than nothing--you that are fallen in your own
   sight, you that cannot help yourselves--you are likely to come! I pray
   that you may come at once. I have set before you an open door that no
   man can shut--will you not enter? Come to my Lord this day! Come, now,
   and say, "Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously." May God
   help us to be doing this rather than talking and hearing about it!

   Let us come to God, for He will help us to come. You see He helps us by
   giving us words, but as He never helps men to be hypocrites, He will
   also help us to feel the words! He who gives us words to speak, will
   give us Divine Grace to speak them sincerely. Are not these words the
   true desires of your hearts? On your knees, when you get home, pour
   them out before God. In your pews while you are here, present these
   petitions in silence. Say, "Take away all iniquity, receive me
   graciously: so will I render the calves of my lips." The Lord's help
   will suffice, not only to teach us the manner of praying, but to give
   us the desire, the faith, the love, the resolve which make up this
   prayer!

   Let your coming to the Lord be decisive and actual. You have meant it
   for years and yet nothing has been done. Some of you have been hearing
   me preach, now, for a quarter of a century! Think of that! I met, the
   other day, with one who heard me at New Park Street--and, at last, by
   our Master's Grace, he has come out to confess his Lord after more than
   30 years! Slow work this! Better late than never! Come, my Friends, are
   you going to stick in the mud forever? Will you lie outside the
   wicket-gate throughout another year? God grant you may cry right now,
   "Take away all iniquity: receive us graciously!"

   Oh, that this might be the universal cry of all my audience at this
   hour! The text is not written as for one, but for many. "Take with you
   words." The first verse is in the singular and speaks of, "you." But
   the second is in the plural and speaks of, "us." It is not, "Take away
   all iniquity; receive me graciously"--but--"receive us graciously: so
   will we render the calves of our lips. Ashur shall not save us." Come
   along with you, then, the whole company of you who desire salvation! I
   call upon you who are sitting in this first gallery all around me! I
   call upon the dense mass in the area below! I call upon you who sit in
   the upper gallery! Oh, that we might all join in one common return unto
   the Lord! Let us call this day, "The day of the joyous return." "Come,
   and let us return unto the Lord: for He has torn, and He will heal us;
   He has smitten, and He will bind us up." Who says, "No"? What? Will you
   choose your own destruction and persevere in the way of sin? I hope you
   will all say, "Yes," and that the Holy Spirit will lead you to carry
   out the resolve.

   The special call is to the fallen--"Return; for you have fallen." Come,
   you fallen ones, come and welcome! It is to the wandering, for to such
   is the command appropriate, which says, "Return."--

   "Return, O wanderer, to your home!

   Your Father calls for you. No longer now an exile roam In guilt and
   misery-- Return! Return!"

   The call is to the forlorn and destitute-- "In You the fatherless find
   mercy." You that are fallen, far off, fatherless and forlorn, come at
   once to God in Jesus Christ! Come now! Come! Come! Come! See how the
   Lord meets you! Read the fourth verse--I could almost kiss the lines as
   I gaze on them--"I will heal their backsliding." Come, sick one, here
   is healing for you. "I will love them freely." Come, unlovely one, here
   is love for you! "My anger is turned away from him"--though you have
   felt His wrath burning in your souls, it is gone forever! "I will be as
   the dew unto Israel"-- before this service is quite over, some drops of
   dew shall have fallen upon your parched spirits and shall sparkle in
   your bosoms like diamonds glittering in the sun!

   These later verses speak as if the gracious work were done. They
   describe a scene most bright, full of color and rich with perfume--as
   an accomplished fact! The chapter begins with an exhortation, but it
   runs into description, as if the people really had come and God had met
   them and had blessed them exceedingly! Lord, make it so at this very
   moment! May it not be merely that I have preached and that these people
   have listened most encouragingly, but may men be really saved through
   Your Grace! The Lord's people have been praying all the while, "God
   bless Your servant"--and now I shall look for fruit from this first of
   March!

   The Lord grant that this March may come in like a lamb to many of you!
   May the lion go out of you! May a heavenly wind spring up and blow
   across this city and bring soul-healing with it! In this hope, I bid
   you again, "Come to Jesus." Jesus says, "If any man thirsts, let him
   come to Me, and drink." "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let
   him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty, come. And
   whoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely." The Lord
   gather you all into the arms of His Grace, for His Son's sake! Amen.

A Poor Man's Cry--and What Came Of It

   (No. 2193)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, MARCH 8, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all
   his troubles." Psalm 34:6

   ON the morning of last Lord's-Day [Sermon #2192, The JoyousReturri] we
   labored to bring sinners to their God and the Lord graciously made the
   Word effectual. We gave voice to the invitation to return and we
   entreated men to take with them words and turn to the Lord. God's
   people found it a happy time. It is a very amazing fact, but an
   undoubted one, that the simple Gospel which saves sinners also feeds
   saints! Saints are never better pleased than when they hear those first
   Truths of God which instruct sinners in the way to God. The Lord be
   thanked that it is so!

   On this occasion I want to speak of what happens to those who do return
   to God--because many have newly been brought through mighty Grace. Some
   of them I have seen and I have rejoiced over them with exceedingly
   great joy. They tell me that they did distinctly lay hold on eternal
   life last Sunday--and they are clear about what it means. They came out
   of darkness into His marvelous Light! They knew it and could not resist
   the impulse to tell at once those with whom they sat in the pews--that
   God had brought them up out of the horrible pit--and had set their feet
   upon the Rock of Salvation!

   For this joyful reason I think we will go a step further and talk of
   the happiness of those who have come back to their Father, have
   confessed sin, have accepted the great Sacrifice and have found peace
   with God. It is my heart's desire that those sheep who have come into
   the fold may be the means of inducing others to enter. You know how one
   sheep leads another and, perhaps, when some come to Christ, many others
   will follow. When one of our professional beggars knocks at a door and
   gets well received, he is very apt to send another. I have heard that
   vagrants make certain marks near the door by way of telling others of
   the confraternity which are good houses to call at. If you want many
   beggars at your house, feed one and another of them well, and birds of
   the same feather will flock to you! Perhaps while I am telling how
   Christ has received poor needy ones, others may pluck up courage and
   say, "We will go, also." If they try it, they may be sure of receiving
   the same generous welcome as others have done, for our Lord keeps open
   house for coming sinners!

   He has distinctly said, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast
   out." That does not refer merely to those who have come, but to those
   who are coming--and to you, dear Hearers, who will come at this hour!
   Jesus bids every hungry and thirsty soul come to Him at once and be
   satisfied from His fullness. Our text tells how they have sped who have
   cried to God. "This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved
   him out of all his troubles."

   I. The first lesson we shall learn, this morning, is upon THE NATURE
   AND THE EXCELLENCE OF PRAYER-- This poor man cried, and the Lord heard
   him, and saved him."--

   "Prayer is appointed to convey

   The blessings God ordains to give." He gives us prayer as a basket and
   then He pours the blessings of His Grace into it! We shall learn from
   the text much about prayer.

   Evidently it is a dealing with the Lord. "This poor man cried, and the
   Lord heard him." He cried to the Lord that the Lord might hear him. His
   prayer was not intended for men, nor was it mainly meant to be a relief
   to his own mind--it was intended for the ear of God and it went where
   it was intended to go! The arrow of desire was shot towards Heaven. It
   reached the mark it was designed to reach. This poor man cried to the
   Lord and the Lord is the right Person to whom to appeal in prayer. I am
   afraid that many public prayers are a performance to please the
   congregation. And when they are mixed with music, it is hoped that they
   will influence men of taste.

   Even private prayer is not always directed to God as it should be. I
   have heard ignorant people, sometimes, use the expression, "The
   minister came and prayed to me." That is a great mistake! We do not
   pray to you--we pray to God. We pray for you, but not to you. Yet I am
   afraid that the blunder reveals a mournfully dark state of mind as to
   what prayer is and does. I fear that many prayers are meant for the
   ears of men, or have no meaning at all beyond being regarded as a sort
   of incantation which may mysteriously benefit the utterer of them.
   Believe me, to repeat good words is a small matter--to go over the best
   composed forms of devotion will be useless, except the heart rises into
   real dealings with God! You must speak with God and plead with Him. I
   often question those who come to join the Church in this fashion-- "You
   say there is a great difference in you: is there a difference in your
   prayers?" I very frequently get such an answer as this, "Yes, Sir, I
   now pray to God. I hope that He hears me. I know that He is near and I
   speak to Him, whereas before I did not seem to care whether God was
   there or not. I said my prayers by rote and it did not seem like
   speaking to anybody."

   Prayer is dealing with God. The best prayer is that which comes to
   closest grips with the God of Mercy. Prayer is to ask of God, as a
   child asks of its father, or as a friend makes request to his friend. O
   my Hearer, you have forgotten God! You have lived without speaking to
   Him--this has been the case for years. Is not this a wrong state of
   things? You are now in need--come and spread your case before your
   God--ask Him to help you. You need to be saved! Beg Him to save you.
   Let your prayer reach from your heart to the Throne of God, otherwise,
   however long it may be, it will not reach far enough to bless you.

   From this Psalm we learn that prayer takes various shapes. Notice, in
   the fourth verse, David writes, "I sought the Lord and He heard me."
   Seeking is prayer. When you cannot get to God, when you feel as if you
   had lost sight of Him and could not find Him, your seeking is prayer.
   "I sought the Lord and He heard me"--He heard me seeking Him-- heard me
   feeling after Him in the dark. He heard me running up and down if haply
   I might find Him. To search after the Lord is prayer such as God hears.
   If your prayer is no better than a seeking after one you cannot as yet
   find, the Lord will hear it. In the next verse David puts it, "They
   looked unto Him." Then a looking unto God is a prayer! Often the very
   best prayer is a look towards God--a look which says, "Lord, I believe
   You. I trust You. Be pleased to show Yourself to me." If there is "life
   in a look," then there is the breath of life in a look and prayer is
   that breath! If you cannot find words, it is often a very blessed thing
   to sit still and look towards the hills from where our help comes. I
   sometimes feel that I cannot express my desires and, at other seasons,
   I do not know my desires, except that I long for God--in such a case I
   sit still and look up. "In the morning will I direct my prayer unto
   You, and will look up." A look is a choice prayer--if it is the look of
   tearful eyes towards a bleeding Savior!

   We might describe prayer in many other ways, as, for instance, in this
   one--"O taste and see that the Lord is good," which you meet with in
   verse eight. Tasting is a high kind of prayer, for it ventures to take
   what it asks for. When we come boldly to the Throne of Grace, we have a
   taste of Divine Grace in the act of coming! That is a very acceptable
   prayer which boldly ventures to believe that it has the petition which
   it has asked of God. Believe that God has heard you and you are heard!
   Take the good your God provides you--take it to yourself boldly and
   fear not! Come boldly to the Throne of the heavenly Grace, that you may
   find and receive. Lay hold upon the blessing which you need so much and
   it will be neither robbery nor presumption.

   But frequently, according to our text, prayer is best described as a
   cry. What does this mean? "This poor man cried." This poor man did not
   make a grand oration--he took to crying! He was short--it was only a
   cry. In great pain a man will cry out. He cannot help it, even if he
   could. A cry is short, but it is not sweet. It is intense and painful,
   and it cannot be silenced. We cry because we must cry. This poor man
   cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner." That is not a long prayer, but
   it prays a great deal of meaning into a few words. That was a short
   cry, "Lord, save, or I perish!" And that other, "Lord, help me." "Save,
   Lord," is a notable cry. And so is, "Lord remember me." Many prevailing
   prayers are like cries because they are brief, sharp and
   uncontrollable. A cry is not only brief, but bitter. A cry is a
   sorrowful thing-- it is the language of pain. It would be hard for me
   to stand here and imitate a cry. No, a cry is not artificial, but a
   natural production--it is not from the lips, but from the soul, that a
   man cries. A cry, attended with a flood of tears, a bitter wail, a
   deep-fetched sigh--these are prayers that enter into the ears of the
   Host High. O Penitent, the more you sorrow in your prayer, the more
   wings your prayer has towards God! A cry is a brief thing and a bitter
   thing. A cry has in it

   much meaning and no music. You cannot set a cry to music. The sound
   grates on the ears. It rasps the heart. It startles and it grieves the
   minds of those who hear it. Cries are not for musicians, but for
   mourners.

   Can you expound a child's cry? It is pain felt, a desire for relief
   naturally expressed, a longing forcing itself into sound! It is a plea,
   a prayer, a complaint, a demand. It cannot wait, it brooks no delay, it
   never puts off its request till tomorrow. A cry seems to say, "Help me
   now! I cannot bear it any longer. Come, O come, to my relief!" When a
   man cries, he never thinks of the pitch of his voice, but he cries out
   as he can, out of the depths of his soul. Oh, for more of such praying!

   A cry is a simple thing. The first thing a new-born child does is
   cry--and he usually does plenty of it for years after! You do not need
   to teach children to cry! Theirs is the cry of Nature in distress. I
   never heard of a class at a Board School to teach babes to cry. All
   children can cry--even those who are without their reasoning faculties
   can cry. Yes, even the beast and the bird can cry. If prayer is a cry,
   it is clear that it is one of the simplest acts of the mind. O my
   Hearer, whatever you need, pray for it in the way which your awakened
   heart suggests to you! God loves natural expressions when we come
   before Him. Not that which is fine, but that which is on fire, he
   loves. Not that which is dressed up, but that which leaps out of the
   soul just as it is born in the heart, He delights to receive! This poor
   man did not do anything grand--but from his soul he cried.

   A cry is as sincere as it is simple. Prayer is not the mimicry of a
   cry, but the real thing. You need not ask a man or woman, when crying,
   "Do you mean it?" Could they cry, otherwise? A true cry is the product
   of a real pain and the expression of a real need--and, therefore, it is
   a real thing. Dear Souls, if you do not know how to pray, cry! Cry
   because you cannot pray! Cry because you are lost by nature and by
   practice and will soon be lost forever unless Grace prevents. Cry with
   a strong desire to be saved from sin and to be washed in the precious
   blood of Jesus! Pour out your hearts like water before the Lord. Just
   as a man takes a pitcher and turns it upside down, pouring all the
   water out, so turn your hearts upside down and let them flow out until
   the last dreg has run away! "You people, pour out your heart before
   Him." Such an outpouring of heart will be a cry and a prayer.

   But now note, further, concerning the nature and excellence of prayer,
   that prayer is heard in Heaven. "This poor man cried, and the Lord
   heard him." He was all alone, so that nobody else heard him--but the
   Lord heard him! Yes, the Lord, even Jehovah of Hosts, the All-Glorious,
   bowed His ear to him! In God's ears the songs of angels are continually
   resounding. Yes, He hears all the voices of all the creatures He has
   made! Yet He stooped from His eternal Glory and gave attention to the
   poor man's cry! Never imaging that a praying heart ever pleads to a
   deaf God, or that God is so far removed from men that He takes no note
   of their desires. God does hear prayer--He does grant the desires and
   requests of lowly men! I do not think that we shall ever pray in
   downright earnest unless we believe that God hears.

   I have been told that prayer is an excellent devotional exercise,
   highly satisfying and useful, but that there its result ends, for we
   cannot imagine that the Infinite Mind can be moved by the cries of men.
   Do not believe so gross a lie, or you will soon cease to pray! No man
   will pray for the mere love of the act, when he has arrived at the
   opinion that there is no good in it so far as God is concerned!
   Brothers and Sisters, amidst all the innumerable goings forth of Divine
   Power, the Lord never ceases to listen to the cries of those who seek
   His face! It is always true--"The righteous cry and the Lord hears."
   Wonderful fact this! Truly marvelous! It might surpass our faith if it
   were not written in His Word and experienced in our lives.

   Many of us know that the Lord has heard us. Doubt about this matter has
   long been buried under a pyramid of evidence. We have often come from
   the Throne of Grace as sure that God had heard us as we were sure that
   we had prayed! In fact, our doubts all lie around our own praying and
   do not touch our assurance that God hears true prayer. The abounding
   answers to our supplications have been proofs positive that prayer
   climbs above the region of earth and time--and touches God and His
   infinity. Yes, it is still the case that the Lord listens to the voice
   of a man! It is still Jehovah's special title--the God That Hears
   Prayer! The Lord will hear your prayer, my Hearer, even if you cannot
   put it into words--He has an ear for thoughts, sighs and longings! A
   wordless prayer is not silent to Him. God reads the intents of the
   heart and cares more for these than for the syllables of the lips. This
   poor man could not speak--his heart was so full that he could only
   cry--but Jehovah heard him!

   Once more, prayer has this excellence--that it wins answers from God.
   "The Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles." God does
   put forth power in answer to prayer. I know the difficulties which are
   started concerning this.

   There is a fixed purpose, from which God does not depart. But this is
   by no means inconsistent with the prevalence of prayer, for the God who
   decrees to give us blessings has also decreed that we shall ask for
   them! The prayer and the Providence are, alike, appointed by the
   predestination of God! Our praying is the shadow of God's giving. When
   He is about to bestow a blessing, He first of all works in us earnest
   prayer for it. God moves us to pray--we pray. God hears and
   answers--this is the process of Divine Grace. The Lord does, in very
   deed, answer prayer!

   I read yesterday certain notes taken by an interviewer who called on me
   some years ago. He reports that he said to me, "Then you have not
   modified your views in any way as to the efficacy of prayer?" In his
   description he says--"Mr. Spurgeon laughed and replied, Only in my
   faith growing far stronger and firmer than ever. It is not a matter of
   faith with me, but of knowledge and everyday experience. I am
   constantly witnessing the most unmistakable instances of answers to
   prayer. My whole life is made up of them. To me they are so familiar as
   to cease to excite my surprise, but to many they would seem marvelous,
   no doubt. Why, I could no more doubt the efficacy of prayer than I
   could disbelieve in the law of gravitation! The one is as much a fact
   as the other, constantly verified every day of my life."

   The interviewer reported me correctly and I would repeat the testimony!
   I could speak with even deeper confidence today. More than 40 years I
   have tried my Master's promises at the Mercy Seat and I have never yet
   met with a repulse from Him. In the name of Jesus I have asked and
   received, save only when I have asked amiss. It is true I have had to
   wait because my time was ill-judged and God's time was far better--but
   delays are not denials! Never has the Lord said to me, or to any of the
   seed of Jacob, "Seek you My face" in vain. If I were put into the
   witness box and knew that I should be cross-examined by the keenest of
   lawyers, I should not hesitate to bear my testimony, that by many
   Infallible proofs the Lord has proven to me that He hears prayer!

   But, my Hearers, if you need evidence on this point, try it yourselves!
   Remember, the Lord has said, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I
   will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me." Here is a fair test. Make
   an honest experiment concerning it. I have no doubt that at this moment
   I could call upon hundreds in this congregation who would not refuse to
   stand up and say that the Lord hears prayer. "This poor man cried, and
   the Lord heard him." I might call on many a man and woman here who
   could solemnly declare that they cried--and the Lord heard them. Are
   you at this service, Hannah? You were here the other morning with a
   sorrowful spirit and now I see by your countenance that the Lord has
   smiled upon you and your soul is magnifying His name! Prayer has done
   this for you. Is it not so? God answers the supplications of His
   believing people and of this we are witnesses!

   Thus have I set the matter before you and I would remind you of the
   words of the Lord Jesus, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you
   shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for everyone that
   asks, receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, it
   shall be opened." Thus have we been instructed by our text as to the
   nature and excellence of prayer.

   II. Let us move on and note, secondly, that our text leads us to think
   upon THE RICHNESS AND FREENESS OF DIVINE GRACE. Great Grace is revealed
   in this statement--"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and
   saved him out of all his troubles."

   You will see the richness and the freeness of Grace when you consider
   the character of the man who prayed--"this poor man cried." Who was he?
   He was a poor man. How terribly poor I cannot tell you. There are
   plenty of poor men about. If you advertised for a poor man in London,
   you might soon find more than you could count in 12 months--the supply
   is unlimited, although the distinction is by no means highly coveted.
   No man chooses to be poor.

   David, on the occasion which suggested this Psalm, was so poor that he
   had to beg bread of the Lord's priests and though he was a soldier, he
   had to borrow a sword from their treasury. He had no house, no home, no
   calling, no income, no country, no safety for his life. He was poor,
   indeed, who wrote these words--"This poor man cried." Why should men
   imagine that poverty is an injury to prayer? Will the Lord care about
   the age of your coat? What is it to Him that you have a shallow pocket
   and a scanty cupboard? "This poor man cried." Does God hear poor men?
   Yes, that He does, the poorest of the poor, the poor in spirit! He
   hears those who are so poor that even hope has dropped out of their
   box--and that is the last thing to go.

   This poor man was also a troubled man, for the text speaks of "all his
   troubles"--a great, "all," I guarantee you. He did not know what to do.
   He could not see his way in his blizzard of trials. He was surrounded
   with difficulties, as with an iron net, and he could not hope for a
   deliverer. He was a troubled man and because he was a troubled man, he
   cried.

   People wondered what he cried about, but they would not have done so
   had they known his inward griefs. His old companions thought he had
   gone out of his mind--they said religion had turned his brain and they
   stayed out of his way. This poor man cried and no man noticed him
   because he was so poor and so wretched--but "the Lord heard him." He
   does not turn away from the doleful and the desolate--He takes delight
   in coming to them and binding up their wounds!

   This poor man was a mournful man--a man altogether broken down, a man
   who could not hold his head up--he blushed and was ashamed, both before
   God and man. All he did, when alone, was to cry. And if one watched him
   closely in company, the tears might be seen forcing their way from his
   heart through his eyes and down his cheeks This poor man cried, for he
   was so feeble, so faint, so forlorn, that he could not do
   otherwise--but "the Lord heard him." The Lord so heard him as to make
   that poor man rich in Divine Grace!

   I feel sure, also, that "this poor man" was a strange fellow. What did
   he want with crying when others were laughing? It is not a pleasant nor
   a usual sight to see strong men weep. Some men weep because they are
   very tender-hearted, but many others do so, I am persuaded, because
   they have been given to drink. This man was given to inward crying--he
   cried day and night unto the Lord because of a secret wound which never
   ceased to bleed. People could not make him out and they came to despise
   him, or, at least, to be shy of him--but "the Lord heard him."

   He was also a changed man. Why, he used to come in of an evening and
   was a thoroughly jolly companion! But now he looks as miserable as an
   owl and nobody desires his company, he is such a kill-joy. "Poor
   miserable creature!" people say. Even his wife sighs and says, "What
   has become of my poor dear husband?" He was a poor man and as sad and
   singular as he was poor. He sought out secret places and there he
   sighed and cried before the Lord.

   But yet he was a hopeful man. There must have been some hope in him,
   though he could not perceive it, for people do not cry for help unless
   they have some hope that they will be heard. Despair is dumb--where
   there is a cry of prayer there is a crumb of hope! A cry is a signal of
   distress and people will not hoist a rag on a pole unless they have a
   little hope that a passing vessel may spy it out and come to their
   rescue. There is not only hope for a man, but hope in a man as long as
   he can pray. Yes, as long as he can cry. If you do but long, look, seek
   and sigh after God, you are one of those poor men whom I have tried to
   describe--and good will come to you. I can see that poor man now. I
   used to know him, for he was born in my native town and he went to the
   school where I was a scholar. He was hardly a man, but only a youth.
   And then I used to sleep with him, or rather to lie awake at nights
   with him and hear him groan.

   He prayed in my hearing many a time--and very poor praying it was, but
   he meant what he said. I have been with him in the fields and he used
   to tell me that he was such a vile creature that he feared that he must
   be cast into Hell forever! He was afraid that he was not one of the
   chosen and redeemed people of God, and that he would never be able to
   believe in Jesus. I knew him when he gave himself up for lost. I know
   him now. I see him whenever I look in the mirror and I must say on his
   behalf this morning--"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and
   saved him out of all his troubles." Oh, the freeness and the richness
   of Grace, that God should hear nobodies! That God should look upon
   those who are less than the least of all saints--and the very chief of
   sinners!

   If you desire to further see the richness and freeness of Divine Grace,
   by the help of the Holy Spirit, I beg you to remember the Character of
   the God to whom this poor man cried. He who prayed was poor and his
   prayer was poor, but he did not pray to a poor God! This poor man was
   powerless, but he did not cry to a feeble God. This poor man was empty,
   but he went to God's fullness. He was unworthy, but he appealed to
   God's mercy. Our God delights in mercy! He waits to be gracious! He
   takes pleasure in blessing the weary sons of men! This poor man cried
   to that Savior who is able to save to the uttermost! O my Friend, never
   mind how poor you are--you are not crying to your own poor self.
   Remember, you have not to draw water out of your own emptiness--you may
   come to God, who is the Fountain of Grace. Your merit is poverty,
   itself, but the mercies of God are unsearchable riches! The power by
   which you are to be saved lies not in your own spirit, but in the Holy
   Spirit! Therefore cry with great hope and believe that God is as great
   in His Grace as in His power and wisdom!

   While we are thinking of the freeness and richness of this Grace in the
   text, I would have you notice the character of the blessing. "The Lord
   heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles." He gave him
   salvation from the whole of his troubles. His sins were his great
   troubles--the Lord saved him out of them all--through the atoning
   Sacrifice! The effects of sin were another set of grievous troubles to
   him--the Lord saved him out of them all by the renewal of the Holy
   Spirit. He had fallen into a perilous position by his own fault--and
   troubles came upon him thick and heavy--but in

   answer to prayer, the Lord made a way of escape for him, out of them
   all, and led him into peace. He had troubles without and within,
   troubles in the family and in the world, and he felt ready to perish
   because of them--but the Lord delivered him out of them all.

   Note that word, "all"--it is large and comprehensive. If you will
   kindly look at the Psalm, you will see the range of this delightful
   deliverance. We read in verse four--"He delivered me from all my
   fears." Sometimes our fears are more painful than our troubles. We
   suffer more in dreading troubles than in enduring them, but prayer
   banishes such fears. We see that all shame was removed in the same
   way--"They looked unto Him and were lightened, and their faces were not
   ashamed." Happy men, for the shame of their sin is gone! Their shame
   and their fears went when their prayers were heard. They were no longer
   distressed about the past and no longer under apprehension of wrath in
   the future--"He saved them out of all their fears." If you will look
   further on you will find that the Lord saved them out of all their
   needs (v 9)--"There is no need to them that fear Him." "They that wait
   upon the Lord shall not need any good thing." Oh, to be saved from the
   pinch of dire necessity within the soul--saved from all fear, all
   shame, all trouble and then from all need! This is a grand salvation!
   But this is not all, for this poor man was saved from all dangers (v
   20)--"He keeps all his bones: not one of them is broken." He saved him
   out of all real peril. And, lastly, He saved him from all apprehension
   of desertion--"None of them that trust in Him shall be desolate." The
   salvation that God gives in answer to prayer is a perfect one! And He
   gives it freely, gives it in answer to a poor man's cry, without money
   or merit. How complete is God's deliverance!

   Did you ever notice how perfect was the answer which God gave to the
   prayer of Moses when he cried to God for Pharaoh in the day of the
   plagues? When the locusts covered the land, Moses prayed and we read,
   "There remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt" (Exo 10:19).
   So was it with the frogs and even with the flies--"He removed the
   swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people;
   there remained not one." Pharaoh could not have found a specimen of
   locust, or fly in all Egypt! So you may be devoured with troubles as
   the land by locusts and they may be croaking in your ears like the
   frogs in the bedchambers of Egypt--but when the Lord bids them, "Go,"
   they will depart from you and you will be in quiet. He who puts away as
   a cloud your iniquities and as a thick cloud your sins, will soon drive
   away your troubles like a swarm of buzzing flies! "The Lord heard him,
   and saved him out of all his troubles." Is not this Free Grace? Is not
   this rich mercy?

   And, once more, think that this all came through a cry. A cry is all
   that the poor man brought. He did not go through a long performance. He
   did not perform a laborious set of ceremonies--"This poor man cried,
   and the Lord heard him." What can be simpler? Oh, you think you need a
   priest, do you?--a priest on whom a bishop has laid his hands? Or do
   you dream that you must go to a holy place, a pile of stones put
   together in architectural form? Possibly you even dream that you must
   pine all through Lent and not expect joy till you reach Easter! What
   folly is all this! You have but to cry and the Lord will hear you!
   There is but one Priest--even the Lord Jesus! There is but one Holy
   Place-- His glorious Person. There is but one holy time and that is
   today! When the Spirit of God works a cry in the heart of the poor man,
   that cry climbs up to Heaven by the way of Jacob's ladder--and at the
   same instant, mercy comes down by the same ladder! Our Lord Jesus
   Christ is that Ladder which joins earth and Heaven together, so that
   our prayers go up to Heaven and God's mercy comes down to us on earth!
   Oh, that men would be content with the blessedly simple apparatus of
   Divine Grace--"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved
   him out of all his troubles"!

   III. I must be brief on my last head, but it is a very important one.
   Consider THE NEED AND THE USEFULNESS OF PERSONAL TESTIMONY. It is David
   who says, "This poor man cried." You see he tells the story--he writes
   it down in a book for us to read. He weaves it into a Psalm for us to
   sing.

   Testimony is a weighty thing for the persuasion and winning of men, but
   it must be of the right kind. It should be personal, concerning things
   which you yourself know--"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him."
   Never mind if you should be charged with being egotistical. That is a
   blessed egoism which dares to stand out and bear bold witness for God
   in its own person! "This poor man cried." Not somebody over the
   water--"and the Lord heard him"--not a man down the next street. The
   more definite and specific your testimony, the better and the more
   convincing.

   One of our evangelists writes me that when he was praying with an
   inquirer and trying to lead him to Jesus, he was much helped by a
   working man coming in and kneeling down by their side and saying,
   "Lord, save this poor soul, even as you saved me at two o'clock this
   morning!" Afterwards the evangelist asked him how he came to use such
   an expression.

   "Well," said the man, "I was saved then. Just as the clock struck two,
   I found the Savior, and I always like to tell when a thing happens."
   Somehow or other, that "two o'clock in the morning" helped the inquirer
   mightily--it put such a reality into the transaction, he thought, "This
   man knows that he was saved at two o'clock in the morning. Why should I
   not be saved, now, at eight o'clock in the evening?" I do not say that
   we can all tell the date of our conversion--many of us cannot. But if
   we can throw in such details, let us do so, for they help to make our
   testimony striking.

   Our witness should be an assured one. We must believe and, therefore,
   speak. Do not say, "I hope that I prayed. And I--I--trust that the Lord
   heard me." Say, "I prayed, and the Lord heard me." If you begin to
   stutter when you are giving your evidence for the Lord Jesus,
   worldlings will not believe you. Are you sure? If you are not sure
   yourself, you cannot assure others. The accent of conviction is
   indispensable if you would convince. Be sure that you have cried and be
   sure that God has heard you--and then bear testimony to what you have
   tried and proved.

   Give your testimony cheerfully. "This poor man cried, and the Lord
   heard him." Do not say it as if it were a line from "the agony column,"
   but write it as a verse of a Psalm--of such a Psalm as this, which
   begins with, "I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall
   continually be in my mouth."

   Your testimony must have for its sole aim the glory of God. Do not wish
   to show yourself off as an interesting person, a man of vast
   experience. We cannot allow the Grace of God to be buried in ungrateful
   silence. When He made the world, the angels sang for joy! And when He
   saves a soul, we will not be indifferent. Let us call together our
   friends and our neighbors and charge them to rejoice with us, for our
   Lord has found us, though we were lost! Remember how the father, when
   the prodigal came back, said to his household, "Let us eat and be
   merry." So, dear Friends, be glad at heart that the Lord has saved
   you--and tell others of what He has done, saying, "This poor man cried,
   and the Lord heard him."

   Testimonies to facts have weight with men. Those who live to win souls
   have learned from experience that facts are grand things to use in
   their holy service. When you are teaching people doctrines, they will
   often be inattentive and unmoved. But when you come to facts, they
   listen and feel their force. I sat not long ago with one whom I would
   gladly win for my Lord. I told him certain facts with regard to the
   Lord's hearing prayer for the College and the Orphanage and other parts
   of my work for the Lord. I marked the deep interest which these facts
   produced. He believed me to be a man of integrity and he could not
   resist the conclusion that the Lord is a prayer-hearing God! To
   yourself and to others, one fact is better than a dozen inferences!
   Even the hardest of the Gradgrind can only say, "What I need is facts."
   Test prayer for yourself and then boldly state the results--and you
   will have power with men. Personal experience is far more convincing
   than observation--tell facts which you have, yourself, experienced!
   "This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all
   his troubles."

   Such testimony will have most weight with the same sort of men as
   yourselves. When a poor man tells what the Lord did for him, he wins
   the attention and gains the belief of other poor men. When any event
   happens to a person like myself, I become interested in it. The poor
   man says, "I see he is a poor man like myself and if God hears him, why
   should he not hear me?" Does not your brother's salvation cheer you and
   make you feel that you will cry to the Lord, too? How wonderfully God
   has heard prayer from men in singular positions! He heard Jacob when
   his angry brother Esau was close upon him with armed men! At Jabbok the
   Lord heard him by night and he met his brother the next morning with a
   smiling face. Israel in Egypt was in sore bondage, but the Lord heard
   his people's cry and sent Moses--and divided the Red Sea, and brought
   forth His chosen. The Lord heard Samson when he was ready to die of
   thirst. He heard the men of Reuben who cried to God in the battle
   against the Hagarites--"and He was entreated of them, because they put
   their trust in Him."

   He heard Hezekiah and Isaiah when Rabshakeh wrote his blasphemous and
   slanderous letter. We read that, "for this cause they prayed and cried
   to Heaven. And the Lord sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men
   of Assyria." David prayed in the cave, and Elijah on Carmel, and
   Jeremiah in prison--and the Lord heard them! There was once a man in
   the belly of a fish miraculously kept alive. The great fish felt ill
   with such a thing as a living man within him and, therefore, it dived
   deep down till the prisoner felt himself to be at the bottom of the
   mountains! Then, to get vegetable medicine, the fish rushed among the
   sea meadows and Jonah cried, "The weeds were wrapped about my head!" He
   was in a strange, dark, horrible place and he says of it, "Out of the
   belly of Hell cried I." Was his cry of any use? Yes! We read, "Out of
   the belly of Hell cried I, and You heard my voice. My prayer came in
   unto You, into Your holy Temple." Wherever you may be and in whatever
   trial you may be involved, the Lord will hear your cry and come to your
   help. If any

   soul here is, like Jonah, in the very belly of Hell in feeling and
   apprehension, yet, his cry will prevail with Heaven and he shall know
   that "salvation is of the Lord." A poor man's cry will sound through
   the telephone of Christ's mediation, in the ear of God--and He will
   respond to it.

   Now, this witness, dear Friends, while it is very strong to those who
   are like ourselves, will be increased in force as one and another shall
   join us. One person says, "I cried to the Lord, and he heard me."
   "But," says an objector, "that is a special case." Up rises a second
   witness and says, "This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him." "Well,
   that is only two and two instances may not prove a rule." Then, up
   rises a third, a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh--and in each case it is
   the same story--"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him." Surely
   he must be hardened in unbelief who refuses to believe so many
   witnesses! I remember the story of a lawyer, a skeptic who attended a
   meeting where the subject was similar to our theme of this morning. He
   heard about a dozen tell what the Lord had done for them and he said,
   as he sat there, "If I had a case in court, I would like to have these
   good people for witnesses. I know them all, they are my neighbors. They
   are simple-minded people, straightforward and honest, and I know I
   could carry any case if I had them on my side."

   Then he very candidly argued that what they all agreed upon was true.
   He believed them in other matters and he could not doubt them in this,
   which was to them the most important of all. He tried religion for
   himself and the Lord heard him--and very soon he was at the meeting,
   adding his witness to theirs! If I were to put the question at this
   moment to my present audience, what would be the result? Our friend,
   Mr. Stott, said, just now, in prayer, that we were a very promiscuous
   company this dark morning. I agree with him. Still I will try it. You
   that have had answers to prayer say, "Fes." (The response came like a
   thunderclap)! I am sure there are none of us who have ever tried the
   power of prayer who would have to say, "No." If I were to put the
   contrary, there would be no answer. All who are accustomed to pray will
   vote with the ayes. Go home, then, with the words of our text in your
   hearts and on your tongues--"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard
   him, and saved him out of all his troubles."

   Glory be to God! Amen.

Between the Two Appearings

   (No. 2194)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 15, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now once in the end of the world has He appeared to put away sin by
   the sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die,
   but after this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the
   sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the
   second time without sin unto salvation." Hebrews 9:26-28.

   The two great links between earth and Heaven are the two advents of our
   Lord, or, rather, He is the great bond of union, by these two
   appearings. When the world had revolted and God had been defied by His
   own creatures, a great gulf was opened between God and man. The First
   Coming of Christ was like a bridge which crossed the chasm and made a
   way of access from God to man--and then, from man to God. Our Lord's
   Second Advent will make that bridge far broader, until Heaven shall
   come down to earth and, ultimately, earth shall go up to Heaven. At
   these two points a sinful world is drawn into closest contact with a
   gracious God. Jesus herein is seen as opening the door which none can
   shut, by means of which the Lord is beheld as truly Emmanuel, "God with
   us."

   Here, too, is the place for us to build a grand suspension bridge by
   which, through faith, we, ourselves, may cross from this side to the
   other of the stormy river of time. The Cross, at whose feet we stand,
   is the massive column which supports the structure on this side. And,
   as we look forward to the Glory, the Second Advent of our Lord is the
   solid support on the other side of the deep gulf of time. By faith we
   first look to Jesus and then for Jesus--and herein is the life of our
   spirits. We dwell between these two boundaries--Christ on the Cross of
   shame and Christ on the Throne of Glory--these are our Dan and
   Beersheba and all between is holy ground! As for our Lord's First
   Coming, there lies our rest--the once-offered Sacrifice has put away
   our sin and made our peace with God. As for His Second Coming, there
   lies our hope, our joy, for we know that when He shall appear, we shall
   be like He, for we shall see Him as He is. The glories of His sacred
   Royalty shall be repeated in all the saints, for He has made us unto
   our God kings and priests--and we shall reign with Him forever and
   ever.

   At His First Advent we adore Him with gratitude rejoicing in "God with
   us," as making Himself to be our near kinsman. We gather with grateful
   boldness around the Infant in the manger and behold our God! But in the
   Second Advent we are struck with a solemn reverence, a trembling awe.
   We are not less grateful, but we are more prostrate as we bow before
   the Majesty of the triumphant Christ! Jesus in His Glory is an
   overpowering vision! John, the Beloved Apostle, writes, "When I saw
   Him, I fell at His feet as dead." We could have kissed His feet till He
   left us on Olivet, but at the sight of the returning Lord, when Heaven
   and earth shall flee away, we bow in lowliest adoration! His first
   appearing has given us that life and holy confidence with which we
   press forward to His glorious appearing, which is the crown of all.

   I want, at this time, to bring before you those two appearings of our
   Lord. The text says, "He has appeared." And again, "He shall appear."
   The 26th verse speaks of His unique manifestation already accomplished.
   The 28th verse promises the glorious second outshining, as it promises,
   "He shall appear." Between these two lights--"He has appeared" and, "He
   shall appear"--we shall sail safely if the Holy Spirit will direct our
   way.

   My first head is this, once, and no second. And my other division of
   discourse will make a kind of paradox, but not a contradiction--yet a
   second.

   I. Our first theme is, ONCE, AND NO SECOND. Now once in the end of the
   world has He appeared to put away sin by the Sacrifice of Himself."
   This He has done, once, and He will never repeat it. Let us dwell on
   the subject in detail.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ has once appeared and though He will appear
   again, it will not be for the same purpose. On His first appearing, fix
   your thoughts, for the like of it will never be seen again. In the
   bosom of the Father He lay concealed as God. As the Second Person of
   the Divine Trinity in Unity He could not be seen, for "no man has seen
   God at any time." It is true that, "without Him was not anything made
   that was made," and thus His hand was seen in His works but, as to
   Himself, He was still hidden--revealed in type and prophecy--but yet,
   in fact, concealed. Jesus was not manifest to the sons of men until one
   midnight an angel hastened from the skies and bade the shepherds know
   that unto them was born in Bethlehem a Savior, that is Christ the Lord!
   Then the rest of the angelic host, discovering that one of their number
   had gone before them on so wonderful an errand, were swift to overtake
   him and, in one mass of glittering glory, they filled the midnight
   skies with heavenly harmony as they sang, "Glory to God in the highest,
   and on earth peace, good will toward men."

   Well might they sing, for the Son of God now appeared! In the manger He
   might be seen with the eyes and looked upon, and handled--for there the
   Word was made flesh--and God was Incarnate! He whom the ages could not
   contain, the Glorious One who dwelt with the Father, forever unseen,
   now appeared within the bounds of time and space--and humble shepherds
   saw Him and adored! By Gentiles He was seen, for wise men from the East
   beheld and worshipped Him whose star had led them. As He grew up, the
   children of Nazareth beheld Him as a Child, obedient to His parents
   and, by-and-by, He was made manifest to men by the witness of John and
   the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Him at His Baptism. God bore Him
   witness as He went up and down the hills of Palestine preaching the
   Kingdom and proclaiming salvation to the sons of men. Men saw Him, for
   He spoke among them openly, and walked in their midst. His was not the
   seclusion of dignity, but the manifestation of sympathy! "He went about
   doing good."

   He was seen of angels, for they came and ministered to Him--and He was
   seen of devils, for they trembled at His word. He dwelt among us and we
   beheld His Glory--He was the Revelation of God to men, so that He could
   say, "He that has seen Me has seen the Father." He was made still more
   manifest by His death, for in His Crucifixion He was lifted up from the
   earth that all might behold Him. He was exalted upon the Cross, even as
   Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness on purpose, that whoever
   looked to it might live. Then and there He opened those four
   conspicuous founts of cleansing blood which were made to flow by the
   nails. See how it flows from hands and feet! There, too, He laid bare
   His side and set His heart open for dying men and forthwith there
   flowed forth blood and water! Thus we may look into His inmost heart.

   High on the Cross the Savior hung, without veil or curtain to conceal
   Him. "Once in the end of the world has He appeared." I know of no
   appearance that could have been more complete, more unreserved. He
   moved in the midst of crowds, He spoke to men and women one by one. He
   was on the mountain and by the sea. He was in the desert and by the
   river. He was both in house and in Temple. He was accessible
   everywhere. In the fullest sense, "once in the end of the world has He
   appeared." Oh, the glory of this gracious epiphany! This is the
   greatest event in history--the invisible God has appeared in human
   form!

   The text tells us very precisely that in this First Coming of our Lord
   He appeared to put away sin. Notice that fact. By His coming and
   Sacrifice, He accomplished many things, but His first end and object
   was "to put away sin." You know what the modern babblers say--they
   declare that He appeared to reveal to us the goodness and love of God.
   This is true, but it is only the fringe of the whole Truth of God. The
   fact is that He revealed God's love in the provision of a Sacrifice to
   put away sin. Then, they say that He appeared to exhibit perfect
   manhood and to let us see what our nature ought to be. This, also, is a
   truth, but it is only part of the sacred design. He appeared, they say,
   to manifest self-sacrifice and to set us an example of love to others.
   By His self-denial He trampled on the selfish passions of man. We deny
   none of these things and yet we are indignant at the way in which the
   less is made to hide the greater. To put the secondary ends into the
   place of the grand objective is to turn the Truth of God into a lie! It
   is easy to distort truth by exaggerating one portion of it and
   diminishing another--just as the drawing of the most beautiful face may
   soon be made a caricature rather than a portrait by neglect of
   proportion. You must observe proportion if you would take a truthful
   view of things and, in reference to the appearing of our Lord, His
   first and chief purpose is, "to put away sin by the sacrifice of
   Himself."

   The great objective of our Lord's coming here was not to live, but to
   die! He has appeared, not so much to subdue sin by His teaching, as to
   put it away by the Sacrifice of Himself. The master purpose which
   dominated all that our Lord did was not to manifest goodness, nor to
   perfect an example, but to put away sin by Sacrifice! That which the
   moderns would

   thrust into the background, our Lord placed in the forefront! He came
   to take away our sins, even as the scapegoat typically carried away the
   sin of Israel into the wilderness that the people might be clean before
   the living God. The Lord Jesus has come here as a Priest to remove sin
   from His people--"You know that He was manifested to take away our
   sins." Do not let us think of Jesus without remembering the design of
   His coming! I pray you, Brothers and Sisters, know not Christ without
   His Cross as some pretend to know Him. We preach Christ--so do a great
   many more--but, "we preach Christ Crucified." And so do not many more.
   We preach concerning our Lord, His Cross, His blood, His death. And
   upon the blood of His Cross we lay great stress, extolling much, "the
   precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without
   spot." We know no past appearing of God in human flesh except that
   appearing which ended with a Sacrifice to put away sin! For this our
   Savior came, even to save sinners by putting away their sin. We will
   not deny, nor conceal, nor depreciate His master purpose, lest we be
   found guilty of trampling upon His blood and treating it as an unholy
   thing. The putting away of sin was a God-like purpose and it is a
   wellspring of hope to us, that for this reason Jesus appeared among
   men.

   Let us go a step further with our text-- only once does the Lord appear
   for the purpose of putting away sin. He came once to do it and He has
   done it so well that there is no need for Him to offer any further
   sacrifice! "This Man, after that He had offered one Sacrifice for sins
   forever, sat down." He will never appear a second time for the putting
   away of sin. It was His purpose, once, but He has so fulfilled it that
   it will never be His purpose again. The High Priest, as you know, came
   every year with blood for the putting away of sin. He has slain the
   victim this year, but next year he must come in the same manner--and
   the next, and the next, and the next--because the sacrifice had not
   really removed the guilt. But our Lord has come once for this Divine
   purpose and He has so achieved that purpose that He could truly cry,
   "It is finished," for the work is done once and for all. He has so
   perfectly put away sin by the Sacrifice of Himself that He will never
   need to offer a second sacrifice! That our Lord should ever come a
   second time as He came the first time is inconceivable by those who
   love Him! He will come a second time, but in a very different style,
   and for a very different purpose--not as a Sacrifice for sins--but as
   King and Judge.

   And here learn yet further, that only once is sin put away. Jesus died
   to finish transgression and make an end of sin. Our Lord made Atonement
   for sin when He died, the Just for the unjust--He made peace for us
   when the chastisement of our peace was upon Him. When the Lord had laid
   upon Him the iniquity of us all, Divine wrath fell upon Him on account
   of our sins until He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
   Then sin was put away. And there, but never anywhere else, was full
   Atonement presented and iniquity was blotted out! There is no other
   place of expiation for sin but the place of our Lord's Sacrifice of
   Himself. Believing in Him that died on the Cross, our sins are put
   away--but without faith in Him there is no remission of sin. Beyond our
   Lord's, other sacrifice there is none--other sacrifice there will never
   be.

   If any of you, here, are entertaining some "larger hope," I would say
   to you--hope what you please, but remember, that hope without the Truth
   of God at the bottom of it is an anchor without a holdfast. A
   groundless hope is a mere delusion! Wish what you will, but wishes
   without promises from God to back them are vain imaginings. Why should
   you imagine or wish for another method of salvation? Rest assured that
   the Lord God thinks so highly of the one Sacrifice for sin, that for
   you to desire another is evil in His sight! If you reject the one
   Sacrifice of the Son of God, there remains no hope for you--nor ought
   there to be. Our Lord's way of putting away sin is so just to God, so
   honoring to the Law of God and so safe for you, that if you reject it,
   your blood must be on your own head. By once offering up Himself to
   God, our Lord has done what myriads of years of repentance and
   suffering could never have done. Blessed be the name of the Lord, the
   sin of the world--which kept God from dealing with men at all--was put
   away by our Lord's death!

   John the Baptist said, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the
   sin of the world." God has been able to deal with the world of sinners
   in a way of Grace because Jesus died. I thank our Lord even more
   because the actual sins of His own chosen--even of all those who
   believe on Him in every age--have been put away. These sins were laid
   on Him and, in Him, God visited man for them. "He His own self bore our
   sins in His own body on the tree"--and so put them away forever--and
   they are cast into the depths of the sea. The putting away of my guilt
   as a Believer was really, effectually, and eternally accomplished by
   the death of our great Substitute upon the bloody tree! This is the
   ground of our everlasting consolation and good hope through Divine
   Grace. Jesus did it alone. He did not only seem to do it, but He
   actually

   achieved the putting away of sin! He blotted out the handwriting that
   was against us. He finished transgression and made an end of sin--and
   brought in everlasting righteousness when, once and for all, He died
   upon the Cross.

   Beloved, there is a further note here--observe that only once has He
   made a Sacrifice of Himself. "Now once in the end of the world has He
   appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." The very best
   way to describe the death of our Lord is to call it, "the Sacrifice of
   Himself." It may be well rightly to divide the Sacrifice, as the priest
   cut up the bullock or the ram. You may speak of our Lord's bodily
   sufferings, His mental griefs and His spiritual anguish, but, for the
   most part, we are not able to go far in this detailed appreciation of
   the wondrous Sacrifice. We are such poor folk in spiritual things, that
   instead of bringing a bullock which could be anatomized and its vital
   organs all laid bare, we are content to bring a pair of turtle doves,
   or two young pigeons--and these were not carefully divided asunder, but
   burned upon the altar! The most of us have to take our Lord Jesus
   Christ as a whole, since, from lack of understanding, we cannot go into
   detail. What did He offer to God? He made a sacrifice of Himself. Truly
   He sacrificed His crown, His rest, His honor, His reputation and His
   life--but the essence of the Sacrifice was Himself--He, Himself, took
   our iniquity and bore our sorrows. "He His own self bore our sins in
   His own body on the tree."

   Your sacrifice, O Christ, is not to be measured unless we could compute
   the infinity of Your Godhead. It was not only Your labor, Your pain,
   Your shame, Your death--Your Sacrifice was Yourself--what more could
   even You offer? There, on the altar, the Son of God did place Himself,
   and there He bled and died that He might be the Victim of punitive
   justice, the Substitute for guilty men! There was He unto God a
   sweet-smelling savor because He vindicated the Law and made it possible
   for the Lawgiver to be justly merciful. This, according to our text,
   was done once, and only once, and it never will be repeated, so that
   the whole business of our Lord's appearing to put away sin by the
   Sacrifice of Himself, is confined to one appearing and one offering. I
   want that word, "ONE," to ring in your ears. "By one offering He has
   perfected forever them that are sanctified." I would have the adverb,
   "once," go through every ear, and abide in every heart. "By His own
   blood He entered in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal
   redemption for us." Peter says, "Christ also has once suffered for
   sins."

   Once it is, and not more often. To suppose the contrary would be,
   first, to break away from the analogy of human things. Read the 27th
   verse--"As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the
   judgment." A man dies once and after that everything is fixed and
   settled--and He answers for His doings at the judgment. One life, one
   death--then everything is weighed and the result declared--"after this
   the judgment." So Christ comes and dies once. And after this, for Him,
   also, the result of what He has done, namely, the salvation of those
   who look for Him! He dies once and then reaps the fixed result
   according to the analogy of the human race, of which He became a member
   and Representative. Men come not back here to die twice--men die once
   and then the matter is decided--and there comes the judgment. So Christ
   dies. He does not come back here to die again, but He receives the
   result of His death--that is, the salvation of His own people. "He
   shall see of the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied." "You were
   slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood." The Christ is so
   completely Man that He follows the analogies of manhood as the Apostle,
   here, observes, and we must not break away from them.

   To suppose a second death for our Lord would be to forget what He came
   to do. The punishment of sin was, "In the day that you eat, thereof,
   you shall surely die." One death was the sentence. It is true that we
   have to speak of that one death as divided into the first and the
   second death, but it is judicially one sentence of death which is
   pronounced on man. When Christ comes, therefore, He bears the one
   sentence of death. He laid down His life for us. The penalty due to sin
   was death--"In the day that you eat, thereof, you shall surely die."
   Christ, therefore, must die, and die He did--"By the Grace of God He
   tasted death for every man." But it was not said, "You shall die
   twice." No, and Christ does not die twice. "Christ, being raised from
   the dead, dies no more--death has no more dominion over Him. For in
   that He died, He died unto sin once: but in that He lives, He lives
   unto God." He has borne the full sentence which was pronounced on sin
   and thus He has put away the sin which involved us under the penalty.

   To suppose that our Lord should be made a Sacrifice, again, is a
   supposition full of horror. When you study deeply the death of your
   Lord, unless your heart is like an adamant stone, you must be bowed
   down with grief. The visage of Him who was Heaven's Glory was more
   marred than that of any man, and His form more than the sons of men. He
   whose brow was from the beginning surrounded with majesty, had His
   forehead and temples torn with a coronet of thorns! Those blessed
   cheeks that are as beds of spices were distained with spit from the
   lips of menials. His face, which is the joy

   of Heaven, was buffeted and bruised by mockers. His blessed shoulders,
   which bear up the world, they scourged with knotted whips until the
   blood ran down in crimson rivers as the plowers made deep furrows.

   How could they treat Him so? Was it possible that my Beloved should be
   scorned and slandered, spit upon and condemned as a felon? Did they lay
   the shameful Cross upon His blessed back and lead Him through the
   streets amid the ribald mob? He who knew no sin was numbered with the
   transgressors! Found guilty of nothing save excess of love to man, He
   was led away to be crucified. They hurried Him off to die at the common
   place of the gallows. The rough soldiers nailed Him to the Cross and
   lifted up the rough tree for all to gaze upon. I wonder the angels
   stood it! It seems extraordinary that they could look on while men were
   taking their Lord and Master and driving bolts through His hands and
   feet and lifting His sacred body upon the cruel tree! But they did
   stand it and the Christ hung on the tree of doom in a burning heat,
   through the fierce sun and the inflammation of His wounds and inward
   fever. He was so parched that His tongue was dried up like a potsherd
   and was made to cleave to the roof of His mouth.

   There He hung amid derision, His bones all dislocated and His very
   flesh dissolved with faintness as though it were turning back to its
   native dust. Meanwhile His soul was "exceedingly sorrowful, even unto
   death," and the Father's face, which has sustained thousands of
   martyrs, was turned away from Him until He cried, "Lama Sabachthani!"
   And is there heart so brutal as to suggest a repetition of this Divine
   agony? Repeat this!? Repeat this? O Sirs, we rise at once, as one man,
   in mutiny against an idea so revolting! One Calvary is glorious, for it
   has accomplished the grand deed of our re-demption--but two Calvarys
   would mean double shame and no glory! Shall the Son of God, after all
   that He has done, come down on earth to be, a second time, "despised
   and rejected of men"? Shall He, a second time, be dragged through mire
   and blood? It must not, cannot be! God forbid! He has trod the
   winepress once and for all. No more shall He stain His garments with
   His own blood!

   To suppose a repetition of the Sacrifice is to cast suspicion upon the
   work and efficacy of the great offering of Himself. Was not that
   Sacrifice infinite in value? It must have been, for it was the
   Sacrifice of God, Himself! Why, then, present it again? Unless the
   first was altogether or measurably a failure, why repeat it? The
   repetition of the Cross would destroy the Cross! O Man, you have taken
   away from the death of the Lord all its virtue if you would dream of
   His dying yet again! As to that invention of the Church of Rome--the
   continual offering of the unbloody sacrifice of the "Mass"-- it is a
   dead thing, for, the "blood is the life thereof," and it is as gross an
   insult to the one great Sacrifice as could well have been devised by
   His worst enemies. He has forever put away the sin of His people by His
   one offering, and now there remains no more sacrifice for sin!

   My Brothers and Sisters, the idea that our Lord Jesus did not
   effectually perform the work of taking away sin removes the foundation
   of our faith! If by one offering He did not put away sin, shall it be
   repeated? Suppose, for a moment, that He died twice--why not three
   times? Why not four times? Why not 50 times? Why not forever the
   rehearsal of Calvary, forever the doleful cry, forever the tomb of
   Joseph and the dead body wrapped in linen? And yet, even after a
   thousand repetitions, how could we know that we were saved? How could
   we be sure that the Sacrifice sufficed and that sin was really put
   away? If the one offering of Himself did not satisfy justice, what
   would or could do it? Then are we without hope and, of all men, most
   miserable, for a golden dream of the putting away of sin has come to us
   and, lo, it has melted away. Once yonder tree! Once yonder tomb! Once
   the broken seal and the frightened watch--on that ONE Sacrifice and
   Justification we securely rest--and we need no repetition of the work.
   It was enough, for Jesus said, "It is finished!" It was enough, for God
   has raised Him from the dead!

   I do not need, I hope, to linger here to warn you that it is of no use
   to expect that God will put away sin in any other way than that which
   at so great a cost He has provided. If sin could have been removed in
   any other way than by the death of His dear Son, Jesus would not have
   died. If there had been within the range of supposition any method of
   pardon except by the Sacrifice of Himself, depend upon it, Jesus would
   never have bowed His head to death. The great Father would never have
   inflicted death upon the Perfect One if it had been possible that the
   cup should pass from Him. He could never have inflicted upon His
   Beloved a superfluous pain. His death was necessary, but, blessed be
   God, having been once endured, it has, once and for all, put away sin
   and, therefore, it will never be endured again.

   II. We come, now, to look at the rest of the text. Once, and no second
   AND YET A SECOND. "He shall appear a second time." Yes, Christ Jesus
   shall appear a second time, but not a second time for the same purpose
   as before.

   He will appear. The appearing will be of the most open character. He
   will not be visible in some quiet place where two or three are met, but
   He will appear as the lightning is seen in the heavens. At His first
   appearing He was truly seen--wherever He went, He could be looked at
   and gazed upon--and touched and handled. He will appear quite as
   plainly, by-and-by, among the sons of men. The observation of Him will
   be far more general than at His First Advent, for, "every eye shall see
   Him." Every eye did not see Him here when He came the first time, for
   He did not travel out of Palestine, save only when, as an Infant all
   unknown, He was carried down into Egypt. But when He comes a second
   time, all the nations of the world shall behold Him! They that are dead
   shall rise to see Him, both saints and sinners--and they that are alive
   and remain when He shall come shall be absorbed in this greatest of
   spectacles. Then Balaam shall find it true, "I shall see Him, but not
   now: I shall behold Him, but not near." Though they cry, "Hide us from
   the face of Him that sits on the Throne," they shall cry in vain, for
   before His Judgement Seat they must all appear!

   His second appearing will be without sin. That is to say, He will bring
   no sin-offering with Him and will not, Himself, be a Sacrifice for sin.
   What need that it should be so? We have seen that He once offered
   Himself without spot to God and, therefore, when He comes a second
   time, His relation to human guilt will finally cease. He will then have
   nothing further to do with that sin which was laid upon Him. Our sin,
   which He took to Himself by imputation, He has borne and discharged.
   Not only is the sinner free, but the sinner's Surety is also free, for
   He has paid our debt to the utmost farthing. Jesus is no longer under
   obligation on our account. When He comes a second time, He will have no
   connection of any sort with the sin which once He bore. He will come,
   moreover, without those sicknesses and infirmities which arise out of
   sin. At His First Advent, He came in suffering flesh and He came to
   hunger and to thirst, to be without a place where to lay His head. He
   came to have His heart broken with reproach and His soul grieved with
   the hardness of men's hearts. He was compassed with infirmity. He came
   unto His God with strong crying and tears. He agonized even unto bloody
   sweat and so He journeyed on with all the insignia of sin hanging about
   Him. But when He comes a second time it will be without the weakness,
   pain, poverty and shame which accompany sin! There will then be no
   marred visage nor bleeding brow! He will have re-assumed His ancient
   Glory. It will be His glorious appearing!

   When our Lord comes to the fullest in His Glory, there will remain no
   sin upon His people. He will present His bride unto Himself a glorious
   Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. The day of His
   appearing will be the manifestation of a perfect body as well as a
   perfect Head. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun when
   their Lord's Countenance is as the sun shining in his strength. As He
   will be "without sin," so will they be "without sin." Oh, what a
   glorious appearing is this! A true appearing and yet the very opposite
   of the first! Then the text adds--"He shall appear without sin unto
   salvation." What does that mean? It means that He will then display the
   perfect salvation of all those who put their trust in Him! He will come
   to celebrate the great victory of mercy over sin. At His coming He will
   set His foot upon the dragon's head and bruise Satan under our feet. He
   will come to have all His enemies put under His feet. Today we fight
   and He fights in us. We groan and He groans in us, for the dread
   conflict is raging. When He comes again, the battle will be ended--He
   shall divide the spoil of vanquished evil and celebrate the victory of
   righteousness!

   But the Resurrection is the salvation principally intended here. Alas,
   what evil sin has done! How many of our best beloved lie rotting
   beneath the clay! The worms are feeding on those whose voices were the
   music of our lives! The scythe of death has cut them down like
   grass--they lie together in rows in yonder cemetery. Who slew all
   these? The sting of death is sin! But when our Lord comes, who is the
   Resurrection and the Life--from beds of dust and silent clay our dead
   men shall rise--they shall leap up into immortality! "Your brother
   shall rise again." Your children shall come again from the land of
   their captivity. Not a bone, nor a piece of a bone of a saint shall be
   left as a trophy in the hand of the enemy! When our Lord brought forth
   Peter from the prison, He did not let him leave his old shoes behind
   him, but the angel said, "Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals, and
   follow me." And when the Lord Jesus shall come and open wide the door
   of the sepulcher, He will bid us come forth in the entirety of our
   nature and leave nothing behind. Salvation shall mean to us the
   perfection of our manhood in the likeness of our Lord! No aching hands
   and weary brows, then, but we shall be raised in power! Our vile body
   shall be changed and made like His glorious body! Though sown in
   corruption, our body shall be raised in incorruption and this mortal
   shall put on immortality! What a glorious prospect lies before us in
   connection with the day of His appearing a second time unto salvation!

   Now notice that this appearing and this salvation will chiefly belong
   to those who look for Him. Will you bear with me patiently a minute or
   two here? I wonder how many there are in the Tabernacle who are looking
   for Him? The text

   says, "Unto them that look for Him shall He appear a second time
   without sin unto salvation." Beloved, I will put the question
   again--How many here are looking for our Lord's Second Coming? I am
   afraid if conscience has her perfect work, many will have to say, "I am
   afraid I am not among the number." I will tell you what it is to look
   for that Second Appearing. It is to love the Lord Jesus, to love Him so
   that you long for Him as a bride longs for her husband. Why are His
   chariots so long in coming? Come quickly, Lord Jesus! Strong love hates
   separation--it pines for union. It cries, "Come, Lord! Come, Lord!"
   Longing follows on the heels of loving. To look for His coming is to
   prepare for Him. If I were asked to visit you tomorrow evening, I am
   sure you would make some preparations for my call--even for one so
   commonplace as myself. You would prepare because you would welcome me.
   If you expected the Queen to call, how excited you would be! What
   preparation good housewives would make for a royal visitor!

   When we expect our Lord to come, we shall be concerned to have
   everything ready for Him. I sometimes see the great gates open in front
   of the larger houses in the suburbs--and it means that they are
   expecting company. Keep the great gates of your soul always open,
   expecting your Lord to come! It is idle to talk about looking for His
   coming if we never set our house in order and never put ourselves in
   readiness for His reception. Looking for Him means that you stand in a
   waiting attitude, as a servant who expects his master to soon be at the
   door. Do not say, "The Lord will not yet come and, therefore, I shall
   make my plans irrespective of Him for the next 20 or 30 years." You may
   not be here in the next 20 or 30 minutes, or, if you are, your Lord may
   be also here!

   He comes! He is on the road! He started long ago and He sent on a
   herald before Him to cry, "Behold, I come quickly." He has been coming
   quickly over the mountains of division ever since--and He will be here
   soon. If you look for His appearing, you will be found in an attitude
   of one who waits and watches, that when his Lord comes he may meet Him
   with joy. Christ is coming, I must not sin. Christ is coming, I must
   not be rooted to the world. Are you thus expecting Him? I am afraid I
   shall only be speaking the truth if I say that very few Christians are,
   in the highest sense, waiting for the appearing of the Lord. My friend,
   Mr. Govett, in his commentary on my text, reminds us of the story of
   Moses, when God told him to take 70 men up the hill with him. We read
   of these honored men, that, "they saw God, and did eat and drink." What
   a privilege! They were all the Lord's guests! As Moses went up to God
   into the thick darkness, he said to them, "Tarry you here until we come
   again unto you."

   Moses was gone for 40 days--how many of the 70 waited for him? I do not
   know when they began to slip down from the hill, or whether they went,
   one by one, or in groups. but when Moses returned, not a soul of them
   was left, save Joshua, whom Moses had taken up with him to still higher
   ground. The 70 had gone down among the people and probably spread that
   unbelief among them which led to the making of the golden calf. None
   can do so much mischief as those who have been with God, but cannot
   wait for the glorious appearing! You tell me Moses was gone a long
   time--well-near six weeks! Yes, and that is why many cannot wait for
   the Lord, now, because the delay is so long--it is nearly 1,900 years
   since He went away. True, 4,000 years rolled away before He came the
   first time, but 2,000 quite wear out the watchers for His Second
   Coming. Men cannot wait and, therefore, go down to the world and help
   to fashion its idols. Only here and there do we see a Joshua who will
   abide in his place till his leader appears.

   As to watching, this is rarer than waiting. The fact is, even the
   better sort of Believers who wait for His coming, as all the 10 virgins
   did, nevertheless do not watch. Even the best sort of the waiters
   slumbered and slept. You are waiting, but you are sleeping! This is a
   mournful business. A man who is asleep cannot be said to look and yet
   it is, "unto them that look for Him" that the Lord comes with
   salvation. We must be wide-awake to look! We ought to go up to the
   watch-tower every morning and look toward the rising sun to see whether
   He is coming. Surely our last act at night should be to look out for
   His star and say, "Is He coming?" It ought to be a daily disappointment
   when our Lord does not come-- instead of being, as I fear it is, a kind
   of foregone conclusion that He will not come just yet. How pleased we
   are if some daring fellow will tell us when He will come, for then we
   can get ready near the time and need not perpetually watch!

   We would not go to a gypsy in a red cloak and let her tell our
   fortune--but we will let a man in a black coat tell us the fortune of
   our Lord. What folly! Of that day and of that hour knows no man, nor
   even the angels of God! This time of the Advent is a secret and
   purposely so, that we may always be on tiptoe of expectation, always
   looking out--because our Lord is surely coming, but we are not sure
   when He comes. "And unto them that look for Him shall He appear the
   second time without sin unto salvation." Many professing Christians
   forget Christ's Second Coming altogether. Others drop a smile when we
   speak about it, as though it belonged only to fanatics and dreamers.

   But you, Beloved, I trust are not of that kind! As you really believe
   in the First Coming and the one great Sacrifice, so really believe in
   the Second Coming without a sin-offering unto the climax of your
   salvation! Standing between the Cross and the crown, between the cloud
   that received Him out of our sight, and the clouds with which He will
   come with ten thousands of His saints to judge the quick and the dead,
   let us live as men who are not of this world, strangers in this age
   which darkly lies between two bright appearings, happy beings saved by
   an accomplished mystery, and soon to be glorified by another mystery
   which is hastening on! Let us, like her in the Revelation, have the
   moon under our feet, keeping all sublunary things in their proper
   place. May we even now be made to sit together with Christ in the
   heav-enlies!

   Now all this must be strange talk to some of you. I wish it would alarm
   those of you who once made a profession of true religion, but have gone
   back to the world's lies. How will you face Him, you Backsliders, in
   that day when He shall appear and all else shall vanish in the blaze of
   His light, as stars when the sun shines out? What will you do when your
   treachery shall be made clear to your consciences by His appearing?
   What will you do, who have sold your Master and given up your Lord, who
   was and is your only hope for the putting away of your sins? Oh, I pray
   you, as you love yourselves, go to Him as He appears in His First
   Coming and then, washed in His blood, go forward to meet Him in His
   Second Coming for salvation.

   God bless you and, by His Son and Spirit, make you ready for that great
   day which comes on apace!

The Obedience of Faith

   (No. 2195)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST 21, 1890,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he
   should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not
   knowing where he went." Hebrews 11:8.

   THE part of the text to which I shall call your attention lies in these
   words, "By faith Abraham obeyed.''" Obedience--what a blessing it would
   be if we were all trained to it by the Holy Spirit! How fully should we
   be restored if we were perfect in it! If all the world would obey the
   Lord, what a Heaven on earth there would be! Perfect obedience to God
   would mean love among men, justice to all classes and peace in every
   land! Our will brings envy, malice, war--but the Lord's will would
   bring us love, joy, rest, bliss. Obedience--let us pray for it for
   ourselves and others!--

   "Is there a heart that will not bend

   To Your Divine control?

   Descend, O Sovereign Love, descend,

   And melt that stubborn soul."

   Surely, though we have had to mourn our disobedience with many tears
   and sighs, we now find joy in yielding ourselves as servants of the
   Lord--our deepest desire is to do the Lord's will in all things. Oh,
   for obedience! It has been supposed by many ill-instructed people that
   the Doctrine of Justification by Faith is opposed to the teaching of
   good works, or obedience. There is no truth in the supposition! We
   preach the obedience of faith. Faith is the fountain, the foundation
   and the fosterer of obedience! Men will not obey God till they believe
   Him. We preach faith in order that men may be brought to obedience. To
   disbelieve is to disobey! One of the first signs of practical obedience
   is found in the obedience of the mind, the understanding and the
   heart--and this is expressed in believing the teaching of Christ,
   trusting to His work and resting in His salvation.

   Faith is the morning star of obedience. If we would work the work of
   God, we must believe on Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Brothers and
   Sisters, we do not give a secondary place to obedience, as some
   suppose. We look upon the obedience of the heart to the will of God as
   salvation! The attainment of perfect obedience would mean perfect
   salvation. We regard sanctification, or obedience, as the great design
   for which the Savior died. He shed His blood that He might cleanse us
   from dead works and purify unto Himself a people zealous for good
   works. It is for this that we were chosen-- we are "elect unto
   holiness." We know nothing of election to continue in sin! It is for
   this that we have been called--we are "called to be saints." Obedience
   is the grand objective of the work of Divine Grace in the hearts of
   those who are chosen and called--they are to become obedient
   children--conformed to the image of the Elder Brother, with whom the
   Father is well pleased.

   The obedience that comes of faith is of a noble sort. The obedience of
   a slave ranks a little higher than the obedience of a well-trained
   horse or dog, for it is tuned to the crack of the whip. Obedience which
   is not cheerfully rendered is not the obedience of the heart and,
   consequently, is of little worth before God. If the man obeys because
   he has no opportunity of doing otherwise and if, were he free, he would
   at once become a rebel--there is nothing in his obedience. The
   obedience of faith springs from a principle within and not from
   compulsion without. It is sustained by the mind's soberest reasoning
   and the heart's warmest passion. The man reasons with himself that he
   ought to obey his Redeemer, his Father, his God and, at the same time,
   the love of Christ constrains him to do so, and thus, what argument
   suggests affection, performs!

   A sense of great obligation, an apprehension of the fitness of
   obedience and spiritual renewal of heart work an obedience which
   becomes essential to the sanctified soul. Therefore, it is not relaxed
   in the time of temptation, nor destroyed in

   the hour of losses and sufferings. Life has no trial which can turn the
   gracious soul from its passion for obedience! Death, itself, does but
   enable it to render an obedience which shall be as blissful as it will
   be complete. Yes, this is a chief ingredient of Heaven--that we shall
   see the face of our Lord and serve Him day and night in His Temple.
   Meanwhile, the more fully we obey at this present, the nearer we shall
   be to His Temple gate. May the Holy Spirit work in us, so that, by
   faith--like Abraham--we may obey!

   I preach to you, at this time, obedience--absolute obedience to the
   Lord God! But I preach the obedience of a child, not the obedience of a
   slave; the obedience of love, not of terror; the obedience of faith,
   not of dread. I shall urge you, as God shall help me, in order that you
   may come to this obedience, that you should seek after stronger
   faith--"For by faith Abraham obeyed." In every case where the father of
   the faithful obeyed, it was the result of his faith--and in every case
   in which you and I shall render true obedience--it will be the product
   of our faith. Obedience, such as God can accept, never comes out of a
   heart which thinks God a liar, but is worked in us by the Spirit of the
   Lord, through our believing in the Truth, Love and Grace of our God in
   Christ Jesus. If any of you are now disobedient, or have been so, the
   road to a better state of things is trust in God. You cannot hope to
   render obedience by the mere forging of conduct into a certain groove,
   or by a personal, unaided effort of the resolution. There is a
   Free-Grace road to obedience and that is receiving, by faith, the Lord
   Jesus who is the Gift of God and is made of God unto us,
   sanctification.

   We accept the Lord Jesus by faith and He teaches us obedience and
   creates it in us. The more of faith in Him you have, the more of
   obedience to Him will you manifest. I was about to say that that
   obedience naturally flows out of faith--and I would not have spoken
   amiss--for as a man believes so is he--and, in proportion to the
   strength and purity of his faith in God, as He is revealed in Christ
   Jesus, will be the holy obedience of his life. That our meditation may
   be profitable, we will first think a little of the kind offaith which
   produces obedience. And then, secondly, we will treat of the kind of
   obedience which faith produces. And then we will advance another step
   and consider the kind of life which comes out of this faith and
   obedience.

   I will be as brief as I can upon each point. Let us look up to the Holy
   Spirit for His gracious illumination.

   I. First, consider THE KIND OF FAITH WHICH PRODUCES OBEDIENCE.

   It is, manifestly, faith in God as having the right to command our
   obedience. Beloved in the Lord, you know that He is Sovereign and that
   His will is law. You feel that God, your Maker, your Preserver, your
   Redeemer and your Father should have your unswerving service. We unite,
   also, in confessing that we are not our own, we are bought with a
   price. The Lord our God has a right to us which we would not wish to
   question. He has a greater claim upon our ardent service than He has
   upon the services of angels, for, while they were created as we have
   been, yet they have never been redeemed by precious blood! Our glorious
   Incarnate God has an unquestioned right to every breath we breathe, to
   every thought we think, to every moment of our lives and to every
   capacity of our being! We believe in Jehovah as rightful Lawgiver and,
   as most fitly, our Ruler. This loyalty of our mind is based on faith
   and is a chief prompter to obedience. Always cultivate this feeling.
   The Lord is our Father, but He is, "our Father which are in Heaven." He
   draws near to us in condescension, but it is condescension and we must
   not presume to think of Him as though He were such a one as ourselves.
   There is a holy familiarity with God which cannot be too much enjoyed,
   but there is a flippant familiarity with God which cannot be too much
   abhorred! The Lord is King. His will is not to be questioned. His every
   Word is Law. Let us never question His Sovereign right to decree what
   He pleases and to fulfill the decree--to command what He pleases and to
   punish every shortcoming. Because we have faith in God as Lord of All,
   we gladly pay Him our homage and desire in all things to say, "Your
   will be done in earth, as it is done in Heaven."

   Next, we must have faith in the rightness of all that God says or does.
   I hope, Beloved, you do not think of God's Sovereignty as tyranny or
   imagine that He ever could or would will anything but that which is
   right. Neither will we admit into our minds a suspicion of the
   incorrectness of the Word of God in any matter whatever, as though the
   Lord, Himself, could err. We will not have it that God, in His Holy
   Book, makes mistakes about matters of history, or of science, any more
   than He does upon the great Truths of salvation! If the Lord is God, He
   must be Infallible! And if He can be described as in error in the
   little respects of human history and science, He cannot be trusted in
   the greater matters!

   My Brothers and Sisters, Jehovah never errs in deed, or in Word--and
   when you find His Law written either in the Ten Commandments, or
   anywhere else, you believe that there is not a precept too many, or too
   few. Whatever may be the precepts of the Law, or of the Gospel, they
   are, altogether, pure and holy. The Words of the Lord are like fine
   gold--

   pure, precious, and weighty--not one of them may be neglected! We hear
   people talk about, "minor points," and so on, but we must not consider
   any Word of our God as a minor thing, if by that expression is implied
   that it is of small importance. We must accept every single Word of
   precept, or prohibition, or instruction as being what it ought to
   be--and neither to be diminished nor increased. We should not reason
   about a command of God as though it might be set aside or amended. He
   bids--we obey. May we enter into that true spirit of obedience which is
   the unshaken belief that the Lord is right! Nothing short of this is
   the obedience of the inner man--the obedience which the Lord desires.

   Furthermore, we must have faith in the Lord's call upon us to obey.
   Abraham went out from his father's house because he felt that whatever
   God said to others, He had spoken to him, and said, "Get you out of
   your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house."
   Whatever the Lord may have said to the Chaldeans, or to other families
   in Ur, Abraham was not so much concerned with that as with the special
   word of command which the Lord had sent to his own soul. Oh, that we
   were, most of all, earnest to render personal obedience! It is very
   easy to offer unto God a sort of "other people's obedience"--to fancy
   that we are serving God when we are finding fault with our neighbors
   and lamenting that they are not so godly as they ought to be!

   Truly, we cannot help seeing their shortcomings, but we should do well
   to be less observant of them than we are. Let us turn our magnifying
   glasses upon ourselves. It is not so much our business to be weeding
   other people's gardens as to keep our own vineyard. To the Lord each
   one should cry, "Lord, what will You have me to do?" We, who are His
   chosen, redeemed from among men, called out from the rest of mankind,
   ought to feel that if no other ears hear the Divine call, our ears must
   hear it and, if no other heart obeys, our soul rejoices to do so. We
   are bound with cords to the horns of the Altar! The strongest ties of
   gratitude hold us to the service of Jesus--we must be obedient in life
   to Him who, for our sakes, was obedient unto death. Our service to our
   Lord is freedom--we will to yield to His will! To delight Him is our
   delight! It is a blessed thing when the inmost nature yearns to obey
   God; when obedience grows into a habit and becomes the very element in
   which the spirit breathes. Surely it should be so with every one of the
   blood-washed children of the Host High--and their lives will prove that
   it is so. Others are bound to obey, but we should attend most to our
   own personal obligation and set our own houses in order. Our obedience
   should begin at home--it will find its hands full enough there.

   Obedience arises out of a faith which is to us the paramount principle
   of action. The kind of faith which produces obedience is lord of the
   understanding, a royal faith. The true Believer believes in God beyond
   all his belief in anything else and everything else. He can say, "Let
   God be true, but every man a liar." His faith in God has become to him
   the crown of all his believing, the most assured of all his
   confidences. As gold is to the inferior metals, such is our trust in
   God to all our other trusts. To the genuine Believer, the eternal is as
   much above the temporal as the heavens are above the earth. The
   Infinite rolls, like Noah's flood, over the tops of the hills of the
   present and the finite. To the Believer, let a Truth of God be
   tinctured with the Glory of God and he values it. But if God and
   eternity are not there, he will leave these trifles to those who choose
   them. You must have a paramount faith in God, or else the will of God
   will not be a paramount rule to you.

   Only a reigning faith will make us subject to its power, so as to be in
   all things obedient to the Lord. The chief thought in life with the
   true Believer is, "How can I obey God?" His great anxiety is to do the
   will of God, or acceptably to suffer that will. And if he can obey, he
   will make no terms with God and stand upon no reservations. He will
   pray, "Refine me from the dross of rebellion and let the furnace be as
   fierce as You will." His choice is neither wealth, nor ease, nor honor,
   but that he may glorify God in his body and his spirit, which are the
   Lord's. Obedience has become as much his rule as self-will is the rule
   of others. His cry unto the Lord is, "By Your command I stay or go.
   Your will is my will. Your pleasure is my pleasure. Your Law is my
   love."

   God grant us a supreme, over-mastering faith, for this is the kind of
   faith which we must have if we are to lead obedient lives! We must have
   faith in God's right to rule, faith in the rightness of His commands,
   faith in our personal obligation to obey and faith that the command
   must be the paramount authority of our being. With this faith of God's
   elect, we shall realize the object of our election--namely, that we
   should be holy and without blame before Him in love.

   Dear Friend, have you this kind of faith? I will withdraw the question
   as directed to you--and I will ask it of myself--Have I that faith
   which leads me to obey my God? Obedience, if it is of the kind we are
   speaking of, is faith in action--faith walking with God, or, shall I
   say, walking before the Lord in the land of the living? If we have a
   faith which

   is greedy in hearing, severe in judging and rapid in
   self-congratulation, but not inclined to obedience, we have the faith
   of hypocrites. If our faith enables us to set ourselves up as patterns
   of sound doctrine--and qualifies us to crack the heads of all who
   differ from us--and yet lacks the fruit of obedience, it will leave us
   among the "dogs" who are "without." The faith that makes us obey is the
   only faith which marks the children of God. It is better to have the
   faith that obeys than the faith which moves mountains. I would sooner
   have the faith which obeys than the faith which heaps the altar of God
   with sacrifices and perfumes His courts with incense. I would rather
   obey God than rule an empire, for, after all, the loftiest sovereignty
   a soul can inherit is to have dominion over self by rendering believing
   obedience to the Most High.

   Thus much upon faith. "By faith Abraham obeyed." And only by faith can
   you and I obey.

   II. Let us consider, secondly, THE KIND OF OBEDIENCE WHICH FAITH
   PRODUCES. This I shall illustrate from the whole of the verse.

   Genuine faith in God creates a prompt obedience. "By faith Abraham,
   when he was called, obeyed." There was an immediate response to the
   command. Delayed obedience is disobedience! I wish some Christians, who
   put off duty, would remember this. Continued delay of duty is a
   continuous sin. If I do not obey the Divine Command, I sin--and every
   moment that I continue in that condition--I repeat the sin. This is a
   serious matter. If a certain act is my duty at this hour and I leave it
   undone, I have sinned. But it will be equally incumbent upon me during
   the next hour--and if I still refuse, I disobey again--and so on till I
   do obey. Neglect of a standing command must grow very grievous if it is
   persisted in for years. In proportion as the conscience becomes callous
   upon the subject, the guilt becomes the more provoking to the Lord! To
   refuse to do right is a great evil, but to continue in that refusal
   till conscience grows numb upon the matter is far worse.

   I remember a person coming to be baptized, who said that he had been a
   Believer in the Lord Jesus for 40 years and that he had always seen the
   ordinance to be Scriptural. I felt grieved that he had so long been
   disobedient to a known duty and I proposed to him that he should be
   baptized at once. It was in a village and he said that there were no
   conveniences. I offered to go with him to the brook and baptize him,
   but he said, "No, he that believes shall not make haste." Here was one
   who had willfully disobeyed his Lord--for as many years as the
   Israelites in the wilderness, upon a matter so easy of performance and
   yet, after confessing his fault, he was not willing to amend it, but
   perverted a passage of Scripture to excuse him in further delay! David
   says, "I made haste and delayed not to keep Your Commandments." I give
   this case as a typical illustration--there are a hundred spiritual,
   moral, domestic, business and religious duties which men put off in the
   same manner--as if they thought that any time would do for God and He
   must take His turn with the rest.

   What would you say to your boy if you bade him go upon an errand and he
   answered you, "I will go tomorrow"? Surely you would "morrow" him in a
   style which would abide upon his memory! Your tone would be sharp and
   you would bid him go at once. If he, then, promised to run in an hour's
   time, would you call that obedience? It would be impudence! Obedience
   is for the present tense--it must be prompt, or it is nothing.
   Obedience respects the time of the command as much as any other part of
   it. To hesitate is to be disloyal. To stop and consider whether you
   will obey or not is rebellion in the germ! If you believe in the living
   God unto eternal life, you will be quick to do your Lord's bidding,
   even as a maid hearkens to her mistress. You will not be as the horse,
   which needs whip and spur--your love will do more for you than
   compulsion could do for slaves. You will have wings to your heels to
   hasten you along the way of obedience. "Today, if you will hear His
   voice, harden not your hearts."

   Next, obedience should be exact. Even Abraham's obedience failed
   somewhat in this, at first, for he started at once from Ur of the
   Chaldees, but he only went as far as Haran, and there he stayed till
   his father died. And then the precept came to him again and he set off
   for the land which the Lord had promised to show him. If any of you
   have only half obeyed, I pray that you may take heed of this--and do
   all that the Lord commands--carefully endeavoring to keep back no part
   of the revenue of obedience.

   Yet the error of the great Patriarch was soon corrected, for we read
   that, "Abraham, when he was called to go out... went out." I have only
   omitted intermediate words which do not alter the sense--and that is
   exactly how we should obey. That which the Lord commands we should
   do--just that, and not another thing of our own devising. How very
   curiously people try to give God something else instead of what He asks
   for! The Lord says, "My son, give Me your heart," and they give Him
   ceremonies! He asks obedience of them and they give Him will-worship.
   He asks for faith, love and

   justice--and they offer 10,000 rivers of oil and the fat of fed beasts.
   They will give all except the one thing which He will be pleased with!
   "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of
   rams." If the Lord has given you true faith in Himself, you will be
   anxious not so much to do a notable thing as to do exactly what God
   would have you to do. Mind your jots and tittles with the Lord's
   precepts. Attention to little things is a fine feature in obedience--it
   lies much more as to its essence in the little things than in the great
   ones. Few dare rush into great crimes and yet they will indulge in
   secret rebellion, for their heart is not right with God. Hence so many
   mar what they call obedience by forgetting that they serve a
   heart-searching, rein-trying God who observes thoughts and motives. He
   would have us obey Him with the heart and that will lead us not merely
   to regard a few pleasing commands, but to have respect unto all His
   will. Oh, for a tender conscience which will not willfully neglect, nor
   presumptuously transgress!

   And next, mark well that Abraham rendered practical obedience. When the
   Lord commanded Abraham to quit his father's house, he did not say that
   he would think it over. He did not discuss it pro and con in an essay.
   He did not ask his father, Terah, and his neighbors to consider it,
   but, as he was called to go out, he went out. Alas, dear Friends, we
   have so much talk and so little obedience! The religion of mere brain
   and jaw does not amount to much. We need the religion of hands and
   feet! I remember a place in Yorkshire, years ago, where a good man said
   to me, "We have a real good minister." I said, "I am glad to hear it."
   "Yes," he said, "he is a fellow that preaches with his feet." Well,
   now, that is a capital thing if a preacher preaches with his feet, by
   walking with God, and with his hands by working for God. He does well
   who glorifies God by where he goes and by what he does--he will excel
   50 others who only preach religion with their tongues. You, dear
   Hearers, are not good hearers so long as you are only hearers--but when
   the heart is affected by the ears and the hands follows the heart, then
   your faith is proven! That kind of obedience which comes of faith in
   God is real obedience, since it shows itself by its works.

   Next, faith produces a far-seeing obedience. Note this. "Abraham, when
   he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for
   an inheritance." How great a company would obey God if they were paid
   for it on the spot! They have "respect unto the recompense of the
   reward," but they must have it in the palm of their hand. With them--"A
   bird in hand is better far than two which in the bushes are." They are
   told that there is Heaven to be had and they answer that if Heaven were
   to be had here, as an immediate freehold, they might look after it, but
   they cannot afford to wait. To inherit a country after this life is
   over is too like a fairy tale for their practical minds! Many there are
   who enquire, "Will religion pay? Is there anything to be made out of
   it? Shall I have to shut up my shop on Sundays? Must I alter my mode of
   dealing, and curtail my profits?" When they have totaled up the cost
   and have taken all things into consideration, they come to the
   conclusion that obedience to God is a luxury which they can dispense
   with--at least until near the end of life! Those who practice the
   obedience of faith look for the reward hereafter and set the greatest
   store by it. To their faith, alone, the profit is exceedingly great. To
   take up the cross will be to carry a burden, but it will also be to
   find rest. They know the words, "No cross, no crown," and they
   recognize the Truth of God that if there is no obedience here, there
   will be no reward hereafter! This needs a faith that has eyes which can
   see afar off--across the black torrent of death--and within the veil
   which parts us from the unseen. A man will not obey God unless he has
   learned to endure "as seeing Him who is invisible."

   Yet, remember that the obedience which comes of true faith is often
   bound to be altogether unreckoning and implicit, for it is written, "He
   went out, not knowing where he went." God bade Abraham journey and he
   moved his camp at once. Into the unknown land he made his way. Through
   fertile regions, or across a wilderness--among friends, or through the
   midst of foes, he pursued his journey--he did not know where his way
   would take him, but he knew that the Lord had bid him go. Even bad men
   will obey God when they think fit--but good men will obey when they
   know not what to think of it. It is not ours to judge the Lord's
   command, but to follow it. I am weary with hearing men say, "Yes, we
   know that such a course would be right, but then the consequences might
   be painful--good men would be grieved, the cause would be weakened--and
   we ourselves should get into a world of trouble and put our hands into
   a hornet's nest." There is not much need to preach caution
   nowadays--those who would run any risk for the Truth of God's sake are
   few enough. Consciences, tender about the Lord's honor, have not been
   produced for the last few years in any great number. Prudent
   consideration of consequences is superabundant, but the spirit which
   obeys--and dares all things for Christ's sake--where is it?

   The Abrahams of today will not go out from their kindred! They will put
   up with anything sooner than risk their livelihoods! If they do go out,
   they must know where they are going and how much is to be picked up in
   the new country. I am not pronouncing any judgment upon their conduct,
   I am merely pointing out the fact. Our Puritan forefathers thought
   little of property or liberty when these stood in the way of
   conscience--they defied exile and danger sooner than give up a grain of
   the Truth of God! But their descendants prefer peace and worldly
   amusements--and pride themselves on "culture" rather than on heroic
   faith. The modern Believer must have no mysteries, but must have
   everything planed down to a scientific standard. Abraham "went out, not
   knowing where he went," but the moderns must have every information
   with regard to the way--and then they will not go! If they obey at all,
   it is because their own superior judgments incline that way, but to go
   forth, not knowing where they go, and to go at all hazards, is not to
   their minds at all. They are so highly "cultured" that they prefer to
   be original and map out their own way.

   Brothers and Sisters, having once discerned the voice of God, obey
   without question! If you have to stand alone and nobody will befriend
   you, stand alone and God will befriend you! If you should get the evil
   words of those you value most, bear it. What, after all, are evil
   words, or good words, as compared with the keeping of a clear
   conscience by walking in the way of the Lord? The line of the Truth of
   God is narrow as a razor's edge--and he needs to wear the golden
   sandals of the peace of God who shall keep to such a line! Through
   Divine Grace may we, like Abraham, walk with our hand in the hand of
   the Lord, even where we cannot see our way!

   The obedience which faith produces must be continuous. Having commenced
   the separated life, Abraham continued to dwell in tents and sojourn in
   the land which was far from the place of his birth. His whole life may
   be thus summed up-- "By faith Abraham obeyed." He believed and,
   therefore, walked before the Lord in a perfect way. He even offered up
   his son, Isaac. "Abraham's mistake," was it? Alas for those who dare to
   talk in that fashion! "By faith he obeyed," and to the end of his life
   he was never an original speculator, or inventor of ways for self-will,
   but a submissive servant of that great Lord who deigned to call him,
   "Friend." May it be said of everyone here that by faith he obeyed! Do
   not cultivate doubt or you will soon cultivate disobedience. Set this
   up as your standard and, from now on, be this the epitome of your
   life-- "By faith he obeyed."

   III. Just a moment or two upon the third point. Let us consider THE
   SORT OF LIFE WHICH WILL COME OF THIS FAITH AND OBEDIENCE.

   It will be, in the first place, life without that great risk which
   otherwise holds us in peril. A man runs a great risk when he steers
   himself. Rocks or no rocks, the peril lies in the helmsman. The
   Believer is no longer the helmsman of his own vessel--he has taken a
   Pilot on board. To believe in God and to do His bidding is a great
   escape from the hazards of personal weakness and folly. If we do as God
   commands and do not seem to succeed, it is no fault of ours. Failure,
   itself, would be success so long as we did not fail to obey! If we
   passed through life unrecognized, or were only acknowledged by a sneer
   from the worldly-wise--and if this were regarded as a failure--it could
   be borne with joy so long as we knew that we had kept our faith towards
   God and our obedience to Him! Providence is God's business, obedience
   is ours. What comes out of our life's course must remain with the
   Lord--to obey is our sole concern. What harvest will come of our
   sowing, we must leave with the Lord of the Harvest, but we, ourselves,
   must look to the basket and the seed--and scatter our handfuls in the
   furrows without fail. We can win, "Well done, good and faithful
   servant"--to be a successful servant is not in our power, and we shall
   not be held responsible for it. Our greatest risk is over when we obey.
   God makes faith and obedience the way of safety.

   In the next place, we shall enjoy a life free from its heaviest cares.
   If we were in the midst of the forest with Stanley, in the center of
   Africa, our pressing care would be to find our way out. But when we
   have nothing to do but to obey, our road is mapped out for us! Jesus
   says, "Follow Me," and this makes our way plain and lifts from our
   shoulders a load of cares. To choose our course by policy is a way of
   thorns--to obey is as the King's Highway. Policy has to tack about, to
   return upon its own courses and, often, to miss the port after all. But
   faith, like a steam vessel, steers straight for the harbor's mouth and
   leaves a bright track of obedience behind her as she forges ahead. When
   our only care is to obey, a thousand other cares take their flight. If
   we sin in order to succeed, we have sown the seeds of care and
   sorrow--and the reaping will be a grievous one. If we will forsake the
   path and try shortcuts, we shall have to do a deal of wading through
   mire and slough--we shall bespatter ourselves from head to foot--we
   shall be wearied to find our way and all because we could not trust God
   and obey His bidding.

   Obedience may appear difficult and it may bring with it sacrifice, but,
   after all, it is the nearest and the best road. Her ways are, in the
   long run, ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. He who,
   through the Holy Spirit, is always believingly obedient, has chosen the
   good part. He it is who can sing--

   "I have no cares, O blessed Lord,

   For all my cares are Thine.

   I live in triumph, too, for You

   Have made Your triumphs mine." Or, to change the verse, he is like
   Bunyan's shepherd boy in the Valley of Humiliation, for that lowland is
   part of the great Plain of Obedience! And he can also sing--

   "He that is down, need fear no fall,

   He that is low, no pride.

   He that is humble ever shall

   Have God to be his Guide."

   Although he may not reach the heights of ambition, nor stand upon the
   giddy crags of presumption, yet he shall know superior joys. He has hit
   upon the happiest mode of living under Heaven--a mode of life akin to
   the perfect life above! He shall dwell in God's house and be still
   praising Him.

   The way of obedience is a life of the highest honor. Obedience is the
   glory of a human life--the glory which our Lord has given to His
   chosen, even His own Glory. "He learned obedience." He never struck out
   an original course, but He always did the things which pleased the
   Father. Be this our glory! By faith we yield our intelligence to the
   highest Intel-ligence--we are led, guided, directed--and we follow
   where our Lord has gone. To us who believe, He is honor. To a soldier
   it is the greatest honor to have accomplished his sovereign's command.
   He does not debase his manhood who subjects it to honorable command.
   No, he is even exalted by obeying in the day of danger. It is no
   dishonor to have it said--

   "Theirs not to reason why;

   Theirs but to dare and die."

   The bravest and the most honored of men are those who implicitly obey
   the command of the King of Kings. Among His children, they are best who
   best know their Father's mind and yield to it the happiest obedience.
   Should we have any other ambition, within the walls of our Father's
   house, than to be perfectly obedient children before Him and implicitly
   trustful towards Him?

   And, Brothers and Sisters, this is a kind of life which will bring
   communion with God. God often hides His face behind the clouds of dust
   which His children make by their self-will. If we transgress against
   Him, we shall soon be in trouble. But a holy walk--the walk described
   by my text as faith working obedience--is Heaven beneath the stars! God
   comes down to walk with men who obey. If they walk with Him, He walks
   with them. The Lord can only have fellowship with His servants as they
   obey. Obedience is Heaven in us and it is the preface of our being in
   Heaven! Obedient faith is the way to eternal life--no, it is eternal
   life revealing itself!

   The obedience of faith creates a form of life which may be safely
   copied. As parents, we wish so to live that our children may copy us to
   their lasting profit. Teachers should aspire to be what they would have
   their classes to be. If you go to school to the obedience of faith, you
   will be good teachers. Children usually exaggerate their models, but
   there will be no fear of their going too far in faith, or in obedience
   to the Lord! I like to hear a man say, when his father has gone, "My
   dear father was a man that feared God. And I would gladly follow him.
   When I was a boy, I thought him rather stiff and Puritanical, but now I
   see he had a good reason for it all. I feel much the same, myself, and,
   with God's help, would do nothing of which God would not approve."

   The bringing up of families is a very great matter. This is too much
   neglected, nowadays, and yet it is the most profitable of all holy
   service and the hope of the future. Great men, in the best sense, are
   bred in holy households. Godfearing example at home is the most
   fruitful of religious agencies. I knew a little humble Dissenting
   Chapel of the strictest sect of our religion. There was no culture in
   the ministry, but the people were strong Believers. Five or six
   families, attending that despised ministry, learned to believe what
   they believed and to live upon it. It was by no means a liberal creed
   which they received, but what they held operated on their lives. Five
   or six families came out of that place and became substantial in wealth
   and generous in liberality.

   These all sprang from plain, humble men, who knew their Bibles and
   believed the Doctrines of Grace. They learned to fear God and to trust
   in Him--and to rest in the old faith--and even in worldly things they
   prospered. Their descendants of the third generation are not, all of
   them, of their way of thinking, but they have risen through God's
   blessing on their grandfathers. These men were fed on substantial meat
   and they became sturdy old fellows, able to cope with the world and
   fight their way. I would to God that we had more men today who would
   maintain the Truth of God at all hazards. Alas, the rubbery backbone is
   common among Dissenters--and they take to politics, the new philosophy
   and, therefore, we are losing the force of our testimony--and are, I
   fear, decreasing in numbers, too. The Lord give us back those whose
   examples can be safely copied in all things, even though they are
   decried as being "rigid" or "too precise!" We serve a jealous God and a
   holy Savior--therefore let us mind that we do not grieve His Spirit and
   cause Him to withdraw from us.

   Lastly, faith working obedience is a kind of life which needs great
   Grace. Every careless professor will not live in this fashion. It will
   need watchfulness, prayer and nearness to God to maintain the faith
   which obeys in everything. Beloved, "He gives more Grace." The Lord
   will enable us to add to our faith all the virtues. Whenever you fail
   in any respect in your lives, do not sit down and question the goodness
   of God and the power of the Holy Spirit--that is not the way to
   increase the stream of obedience, but to diminish the source of it.
   Believe more, instead of less. Try, by God's Grace, to believe more in
   the pardon of sin, more in the renovation by the Holy Spirit, more in
   the Everlasting Covenant, more in the Love that had no beginning and
   will never, never cease. Your hope does not lie in rushing into the
   darkness of doubt, but in repentantly returning into the still clearer
   light of a steadier faith. May you be helped to do so and may we, all
   of us, and the whole multitude of the Lord's redeemed, by faith go on
   to obey our Lord in all things!

   I leave this word with you. Remember, "By faith Abraham obeyed." Have
   faith in God and then obey, obey, obey, and keep on obeying until the
   Lord shall call you Home! Obey on earth and then you will have learned
   to obey in Heaven. Obedience is the rehearsal of eternal bliss!
   Practice by obedience now the song which you will sing forever in
   glory. God grant His Grace to us! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Psalm 109:33-40.

Hosanna!

   (No. 2196)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 22, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried saying,
   Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is He that comes in the name of
   the Lord; Hosanna in the highest" Matthew 2:19.

   AFTER the miracle of the raising of Lazarus, a great fame went abroad
   concerning our Lord. He still rested at Bethany and the people came up
   to the feast in great number--an easy walk from Jerusalem to
   Bethany--to see Jesus and to see Lazarus, who had been raised from the
   dead. These people, on a certain day, formed a company and marched with
   Jesus towards Jerusalem. On the way our Lord sent two of His disciples
   to fetch a donkey and its colt--and upon this last He rode into the
   city. Another crowd, coming out of Jerusalem, met the company attending
   upon Jesus and, forming one great procession, the whole multitude
   marched into the city escorting the Lord Jesus in humble state and
   paying Him honor as King in Zion. Upon no stately warhorse, but riding
   upon a colt, the foal of a donkey, the meek and lowly King entered the
   city of David attended by vast and enthusiastic crowds who strewed the
   fronds of palms, the branches of trees and their own garments in the
   way along which He rode. Our Lord thus received a right royal and
   popular reception to the metropolis of His nation. This was a strange
   event, so very different from anything else that happened to our
   Savior, that one wonders at it with great wonderment. That it is to be
   viewed as an important event is clear, since every one of the four
   Evangelists takes pains to record it (see Matthew 21, Mark 11, Luke 19
   and John 12). Even of certain of the greater events of our Lord's life
   the Holy Spirit has not preserved us four accounts, but since He has
   done so in this case, He thereby calls us to give the more earnest heed
   to it. Herein is a mine of teaching--let us dig into it.

   Assuredly, this honor paid to our Lord was passing strange--a gleam of
   sunlight in a day of clouds, a glimpse of summer in a long and dreary
   winter! He that was, as a rule, "despised and rejected of men," was,
   for the moment, surrounded with the acclaim of the crowd. All men
   saluted Him that day with their Hosannas--and the whole city was moved.
   It was a gala day for the disciples and a sort of coronation day for
   their Lord.

   Why was the scene permitted? What was its meaning? The marvel is that
   nothing like it had occurred before, for our Lord had healed many sick
   folk and these and their friends must have felt favorably towards Him.
   He had fed thousands at a time with the bread of this life and hosts
   had been cheered and comforted by His teaching. The common people heard
   Him gladly and were ready to gather around Him. Among an excitable
   people it was a wonder that they had not long ago taken Him by force
   and made Him king. No one had yet appeared so like the Messiah of their
   Prophets--no one had so well deserved the people's gratitude. If they
   had, from the first, accepted Him as their monarch, and if they had
   watched every opportunity of doing Him homage, nobody would have been
   surprised. The marvel is that the popular enthusiasm had been repressed
   so long.

   It was the Lord Himself who had suppressed the popular enthusiasm. With
   great skill He had succeeded in bridling a dangerous fanaticism. He
   "did not strive nor cry, nor cause His voice to be heard in the
   streets"--and with such a cry, and such a voice as He had--the marvel
   was that He preserved quiet and kept the nation from revolt. Had He
   withdrawn His hand, the people would have been eager to assail their
   foreign rulers. Had this been the errand on which He came, He might at
   any moment have been saluted as, "the King of the Jews." He, with a
   masterly art, repressed everything that would have made Him a popular
   hero. He uttered unpalatable Truth, or He stole away from the scene of
   His miracles, or He kept Himself in obscure villages--and thus He
   eluded their honors.

   When He had fed the multitudes, He took ship and went to the other side
   of the lake that they might not follow Him. Many men live for ambitious
   ends, but our Lord lived to escape the honors of men. The proud hunt
   after praise, but our Lord fled from preferment, hid Himself from fame
   and shunned the throne which by descent belonged to Him. He often bade
   those whom He healed go home and tell no man what He had done, for the
   dense throngs that gathered about Him rendered it difficult for Him to
   move on His mission of mercy. "He went about doing good," and did not
   wait in any place to reap the laurels which His miracles had earned
   Him. No wonder that, at last, the people felt forced to surround Him
   with their praises! The pent-up fires of gratitude at last had vent!
   The covered flames of admiration leaped up, at last, and cast a
   brilliant light over the old city! Men's hearts had been somewhat worse
   than diabolical if they had not felt a grateful enthusiasm for so grand
   a benefactor. No one before had ever so greatly blessed
   Judea--thousands of voices felt it joy to cry, "Hosanna," before such a
   One!

   It came at last, you see--I have read you the story in John and in
   Matthew. They saluted Him with their shouts of loyal welcome. But there
   was little in the acclamation when it did come. There was great
   shouting for the while, abundant strewing of branches and lining of the
   road with garments--but there was little else. Remember what happened
   less than a week afterwards? If not the same individuals, yet people of
   the same city cried, "Crucify Him, crucify Him." The Hosannas may be
   very loud, but they will not be long. "Blessed is He that comes in the
   name of the Lord" sounds very sweet, but how much more vehement will be
   the cry, "Let Him be crucified"? Everything which comes to Jesus and
   His cause by popular acclamation requires to be duly weighed--and when
   weighed it will be found wanting. "Vox populi, vox Dei," they used to
   say, but the saying is false--the voice of the people may seem to be
   the voice of God when they shout, "Hosanna in the highest"--but whose
   voice is it when they yell out, "Crucify Him, crucify Him"?

   "Surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie."
   So little value did our Lord place on popular applause that He
   repressed it! And when it did burst forth, so little did it elevate His
   spirit that we find Him in the midst of it, gazing upon the city with
   tears in His eyes. While others were glad, He was weeping for the woes
   which His prophetic eye foresaw! The throng was carried away by the
   present moment and the enthusiasm of the hour, but His heart was
   anticipating that dreadful day when they would find His blood upon them
   and upon their children--and the Romans would utterly destroy their
   city and quench the light of Zion in rivers of blood! It may be well
   that an enthusiastic admiration of religion should be professed by the
   multitude, but it is no more stable than smoke! It may seem good that
   the Christian minister should be popular, but popularity is lighter
   than vanity! Once the Savior rides in state as a King, but soon He
   walks down those very streets bearing His Cross like a criminal! How
   soon is the public voice purchased for evil! What dependence can be
   placed on the clamor of the streets?

   We, however, have the story placed before us four times by the
   Evangelists and, therefore, let us now give it our attentive
   consideration. May the good Spirit impart instruction to us by this
   strange stir and singular scene! May some Divine impulse come to us out
   of this riding of our lowly King into Jerusalem!

   First, I shall ask you to think of Christ triumphant in Jerusalem.
   Secondly, I shall bid you see herein Christ glorified in His Church.
   And then, thirdly, we will think of Christ entering into the heart.
   Under these three divisions we may arrange our thoughts and, God
   helping us, we may meditate to profit.

   I. First, I ask you to view CHRIST TRIUMPHANT IN JERUSALEM. Why this
   procession? Why these shouts of

   homage? Our Lord always had a reason, and an excellent one, for all
   that He arranged or permitted. What die He mean by this? How shall we
   interpret the scene?

   I think it was, first, that He might most openly declare Himself. He
   had frequently avowed His mission in plain speech. He had told them who
   He was and why He came, but they would not hear, so that they dared to
   say to Him, "If you are the Christ, tell us plainly." He had plainly
   told them times without number. Now He will assure them still more
   positively of His Kingdom by openly riding into the city of Jerusalem
   in state. Now shall they see that He claims to be the Messiah, sent of
   God, of whom the Prophet said, "Say you to the daughter of Zion,
   Behold, your salvation comes." Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
   shall His fame be proclaimed--multitudes of people shall acknowledge
   with loud voices that, "He comes in the name of the Lord"--until the
   envious Pharisees shall be driven to ask, "Do you hear what these say?"

   You will remember that our Lord rode into Jerusalem as a King, but He
   was also brought there as the Lamb of God's Passover, whose blood must
   save the people. It was not meet that the Lamb of God should go to the
   altar without

   observation. It was not fit that He who takes away the sin of the world
   should be led to the Temple unobserved. The day was near when He was to
   be offered up and all eyes were called to look on Him and know who and
   what He was. Therefore He permitted this great gathering and this
   honorable attention to Himself that He might say to Israel, by deeds as
   well as by words, "I am He that should come. I am He who of old had
   said, Lo, I come: in the volume of the Book it is written of Me, I
   delight to do Your will, O My God." Thus He, beyond all question,
   manifested Himself to the people. When they crucified Him, the rulers
   knew what He professed to be. Albeit many of them were in ignorance as
   to the truthfulness of His claims, yet they knew right well that they
   were crucifying One who professed to be the Lord of Glory--One who was
   acknowledged to be the Son of David--One who had publicly avowed
   Himself to be King in Zion. I think this was one reason for the joyous
   entry into the city of God.

   Next, it was our Lord's public claiming of authority over Israel. He
   was the Son of David and, therefore, He was, by natural right, the King
   of the Jews. If He had taken possession of His own, He would have been
   sitting on the throne of the chosen dynasty of David by right of birth.
   He was, moreover, as the Messiah and Christ, the King of His people,
   Israel. Concerning Him it had been said by the Prophet, "Rejoice
   greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold,
   your King comes unto you: He is just and having salvation; lowly and
   riding upon a donkey, and upon a colt the foal of a donkey." Our Lord
   Jesus literally came to Zion in this manner. As King, He rode to His
   capital and entered His palace. In His priestly royalty, the Son of God
   went to His Father's House, to the Temple of sacrifice and sovereignty.

   Among the tribes of Israel He is seen to be "One chosen out of the
   people," whom the Lord had given to be a Leader and Commander for the
   people. Although they might afterwards choose Barabbas and cry that
   they had no king but Caesar, yet Jesus was their King, as Pilate
   reminded them, when he said, "Shall I crucify your king?"--and as His
   Cross declared, when it bore the legal inscription, "This is Jesus the
   King of the Jews." Before His trial and His condemnation, He had put in
   a public claim to the rights and prerogatives of Zion's King, whom God
   has set upon His holy hill. Would to God all my Hearers fully
   recognized our Lord's Kingdom and yielded to His sway! Oh, that you
   would bow before Him and put your trust in Him! Part of His intent in
   riding through Jerusalem was that we, also, who dwell in the isles of
   the sea might know Him and reverence Him as King of Kings and Lord of
   Lords. Let each one cry in His inmost soul--

   "Great King of Grace, my heart subdue, I would be led in triumph, too.
   A willing captive to my Lord, To sing the victories of His Word."

   Possibly our Savior intended, also, by this singular procession, to let
   His enemies know His real strength among the people. If He could gather
   so great a crowd of adherents without any summons or prearrangement,
   surely the whole population must have been, to a large degree, in His
   favor. If such an enthusiastic reception was spontaneously given Him,
   how many would have gathered if a plan had been arranged? Had He agreed
   to lead them against the Romans, thousands of fanatics would have
   followed His banner! If He had designed to make Himself a king and had
   permitted His servants to fight, the old fierce courage of the Jewish
   race would have burned like a flame of fire and His enemies would have
   fled before Him. He came not with war in His heart, but He would let
   the foeman see the hilt of the sword which He might have drawn from its
   sheath--He would let scribe and Pharisee bite their lips while they
   said, "Perceive you how you prevail nothing? Behold, the world is gone
   after Him."

   If the Savior had willed to use the baser methods that men, nowadays,
   would freely employ, by asking the world's alliance, He might have made
   Himself a King at once. Had He blended politics with religion and
   yielded something to general prejudice, He might at once have set up a
   worldly kingdom! But no, He knew no selfish ambition--His kingdom was
   not of this world! He came not that He might be honored, here, but that
   He might be put to shame for our redemption! The diadem to which He
   aspired was a crown of thorns--yet He lets His adversaries see that He
   was not lowly because He was weak, nor gentle because He was feeble!
   They might, if they would, have seen by that day in Jerusalem, the
   greatness of the self-denial which abstained from earthly honors.

   Nor have I exhausted the Savior's reasons. We are told by the
   Evangelist that He did this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
   by the Prophet. I have just now quoted the text from Zechariah 9:9--our
   Lord was always careful and earnest to fulfill each Prophecy of Holy
   Scripture. He held the Inspired Word in high esteem and was careful of
   each letter of it. You never hear a word from Him derogatory of the
   Inspiration, authority, accuracy, or Infallibility of the Law

   and the Prophets! He fulfils the Word of the Lord even to its jots and
   tittles. He directed His life by that old chart in which the way of the
   Messiah was laid down long before He came to earth! Oh, for the same
   reverence of Scripture among preachers nowadays! God forbid that we
   should be lowering men's ideas of Inspiration, as some are fond of
   doing. May we value every Word which came from the Lord in old time!
   May we willingly change the course of our thought and teaching rather
   than neglect a single Word of Inspiration! When we see what the will of
   the Lord is, let us follow it implicitly. Obedience to the rule of
   Scripture was the way of the Head--it should also be the way of the
   members. If the King, Himself, is careful in His walk towards the Word
   of God, surely we ought to be!

   I also think that as our Lord thus looked back and fulfilled Scripture,
   He was looking forward to give us a prophetic type of the future.
   Beloved, our Lord will not always be rejected. There are days of
   triumph for Him. "The stone which the builders refused is become the
   head stone of the corner." This is the age of iron, but there comes a
   golden age of love and light. We look for His appearing and His
   reign--His reign of peace and joy! There will come a day when the
   kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His
   Christ. He shall sit upon the Throne of His father, David, and of His
   Kingdom there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign forever and ever.
   Hallelujah! Has not Jehovah said to Him, "Ask of Me, and I shall give
   You the heathen for Your inheritance and the uttermost parts of the
   earth for Your possession"? Yes, there will come a day when He that was
   the reproach of men shall be the Glory of His people! Kings shall bow
   down before Him. All generations shall call Him blessed.

   When I see that joyful procession going up the hill to Zion and mark
   how they that went before, joined with those who followed after, while
   the King Himself rode in the center, I seem to see a rehearsal of the
   long succession of the faithful in all ages. The Prophets have gone
   before Him--listen to their loud Hosannas! We come behind Him, even we
   upon whom the ends of the earth have come, and we have our glad
   Hosannas, too! Here Patriarchs join with Apostles, Prophets are one
   with martyrs, and priests keep rank with pastors and deacons--all with
   one voice lifting up the same note, "Hosanna! Blessed is He that comes
   in the name of the Lord." We see, then, in the simple state of our Lord
   in the streets of Jerusalem, a vision of the long glories which await
   Him in the New Jerusalem where He shall sit upon His Throne-- and His
   enemies shall be made His footstool!

   One thing more I cannot help mentioning. Surely our Lord allowed the
   populace a vent for their enthusiasm with the desire to delight His
   friends. Do you not think that the sympathetic Jesus thought it worth
   while to give His little band of followers what our forefathers would
   have called, "a gaudy day"--a high day--a holiday? These had been with
   Him in His humiliation and He would give them a taste of His Glory.
   They had seen Him despised and rejected of men--and He relieved the
   monotony of His humiliation with a glimpse of His Glory. For once they
   should be allowed to cast their garments under His feet and strew
   fragrant branches on His path. For once their zeal should have license
   to climb the trees and break down the boughs to strew His pathway.
   Nothing on that day filled their ears but the praises of their beloved
   Lord and honored Master! They would soon enough have sorrow when they
   would see Him seized in the garden and taken away bound to Caiaphas and
   Pilate to be condemned to die. He would give them a breathing space, an
   interval of pleasure wherein their spirits should no longer drag on
   earth, but rise on wings, into a lofty joy!

   Our Lord loves His people to be glad. He kept His tears to Himself as
   He wept over Jerusalem, but the gladness He scattered all around, so
   that even the boys and girls in the streets of Jerusalem made the
   Temple courts to ring with their merry feet and gladsome songs. Hear
   how they clap their hands with delight! "Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!"
   You hear it everywhere and the Lord smiles as He sees the joy which
   pours in floods around Him. The Lord loves to cast into our cup, some
   drops of Heaven's own honey until the bitterness of grief is sweetened
   and His followers are made happy by their joy in Himself. "Let the
   children of Zion be joyful in their King." I wish I could express
   myself in tones more clear and musical, but though bodily weakness
   compels me to be measured in my utterance, my soul does magnify the
   Lord and my spirit does rejoice in God my Savior. May the Lord Himself
   cast into your hearts the burning coals of joyful love to Him-- and so
   may your souls take fire and blaze aloft with vehement flames of
   delight! May this day be to your spirits a day of palms and Psalms, of
   prayers and praises, of Hallelujahs and Hosannas! Let us sing all day,
   as we sung in our opening hymn--

   "Hosanna to the anointed King, To David's holy Son! Help us, O Lord!
   Descend and bring Salvation from Your Throne.

   Blest be the Lord who comes to men

   With messages of Grace!

   Who comes in God, His Father's name,

   To save our sinful race.

   Hosanna in the highest strains

   The Church on earth can raise;

   The highest heavens, in which He reigns,

   Shall give Him nobler praise!"

   II. Secondly, my text is, to my mind, a parable of CHRIST GLORIFIED IN
   HIS CHURCH. There are choice days when the shout of a King is heard in
   our assemblies. We have not yet fallen to a dull monotony of
   barrenness--we have hills like those of Carmel. The low water mark of
   lukewarmness is covered deep beneath flood tides of holy exultation. I
   am going to speak about these hallowed seasons.

   I think that such days come to the Church of God after special miracles
   of Grace have been worked. Lazarus is raised from the dead and when the
   people see the greatness of the Prophet of Nazareth, they begin to
   commend and extol Him--and this leads on to holy excitement! If the
   Lord will be pleased to work remarkable conversions among us, we shall
   have grand times! If special instances of His gracious power are seen
   by us, we will bear our palms of victory before Him and many hearts
   will enquire, "Who is this?" Our hearts shall rejoice as with the joy
   of harvest when we see the Lord saving great sinners! Yes, we will
   shout as victors who divide the spoil! Do you not think that when Saul
   of Tarsus was converted and the Churches had rest, that they also had
   great exultation in their King? Everywhere it must have been spoken of
   that fierce Pharisee who had become a bold preacher of the faith which
   once he sought to destroy! What joy there is in saintly hearts when
   ringleaders in sin become champions for the Truth of God! Oh that our
   God would work such transformations in this city! Pray, my Brothers and
   Sisters, that the Lord would do the same for us--and for all His
   Churches just now. Oh, for displays of His power to quicken the dead!
   Oh, for Lazarus to be raised and to live among us as a wonder of Divine
   Grace whom neighbors would come to see! O Lord, give us this signal of
   delight! Let us see Your arm made bare in the eyes of all the people!

   Next, it was a time of testimony, for those who had been present and
   had seen Lazarus raised from the dead, bore witness. One stepped
   forward and said, "With these eyes I saw Lazarus come forth from the
   tomb of rock." "As for me," said another, "I saw him buried and I
   helped to carry him to the grave. But I saw him come back to the house
   alive." "Yes," said a third, "I rolled away the stone and as I stood
   watching for the result, I saw the dead man come forth alive--and I
   helped to loosen his grave clothes." All these bore witness to what
   they had seen. You cannot tell what a joyful effect it produces and
   what enthusiasm is stirred when one after another bears personal
   witness. Lord, open men's mouths! Lord, make the quiet ones to tell
   forth Your praise! Your silent tongues deprive us of our joy. Your
   cowardly reticence robs Christ of His Glory and the Church of its
   increase. If God has done anything for you, or you have seen Him do
   anything for others, bear testimony to it! It is the Lord's due and
   your duty, that you should speak to the glory of Christ Jesus. When
   great wonders have been done and those who saw them are willing to bear
   their testimony, then we may look for red-letter days wherein gladness
   and praise shall be in the ascendant.

   It was a good sign, too, of joy to come, that the enemies were now
   raging worse than ever. They sought to kill both Jesus and Lazarus. If
   the devil never roars, the Church will never sing! God is not doing
   much if the devil is not awake and busy. Depend upon it, that a working
   Christ makes a raging devil! When you hear ill reports, cruel speeches,
   threats, taunts and the like, believe that the Lord is among His people
   and is working gloriously. We look upon the "many adversaries" as one
   of the tokens that a great door and effectual is set before us. When we
   hear thunder, we look for rain. Wrath in the lowest Hell is a
   prognostic of Hosanna in the highest Heaven!

   It is also a cheering sign when there is a general eagerness among the
   people concerning our Lord. When the disciples gather around their
   Master and are prompt to do His bidding, then good times are come. When
   all agree, it is also well. When they that go before, and they that
   follow after are all of the same mind, then is it a day of joy. When
   gray heads grow young and young heads grow wise, it is a token for
   good. When the aged lift up their eyes to Heaven and say, "God, even
   our own God, shall bless us," things look well. When our matrons and
   our sires grow hopefully confident and say, "The Lord has blessed us in
   days gone by and He is going to bless us yet again," then the weather
   glass points to "Set fair." When the younger sort, that follow after,
   who have been converted but lately, burn with a holy zeal and cry,

   "We will give the Lord no rest until He blesses us," then the sun of
   the Church is shining high up in the sky. When we are all ready, each
   man, each woman, ready to take our share in the harvesting, then will
   the sheaves be garnered! It is cheering when the congregation shares
   the excitement with the Church and its ministers--and the prospect of a
   Divine blessing is before the mind of all who seek better things.
   Surely, the time to favor Zion, yes, the set time has come, when her
   King is longed for and every heart beats high with love for Him!

   The case is clear when all this is attended with an abounding
   generosity. It is well when disciples are not only willing to fetch
   another man's colt, but are willing to lay their own garments on
   it--when they will not only gather palm fronds to strew the path, but
   will take off their own coats to carpet the way of the King! When
   everybody does something, or gives something, or, at any rate, joins in
   the hearty Hosannas, then is the King come into our midst! Our King is
   not where hearts are miserly and souls are selfish, but one token of
   His Presence is that His people offer willingly unto the Lord. At such
   times Believers feel that they are not their own, but are bought with a
   price--and things which once looked like sacrifices too great to be
   expected of them are cheerfully presented as sacrifices of joy.

   Beloved, we must not forget that it is a token of God's having come to
   His Church and of His having given her a joyful day when the children
   share in it. Luther was greatly encouraged when he found that the
   children met together for prayer. He said, "God will hear them. The
   devil himself cannot defeat us now that the children begin to pray." It
   is very beautiful to read Mr. Whitefield's remarks about his sermons at
   Moorfields and elsewhere in London, when mud and stones were cast at
   him and yet a group of children always surrounded his pulpit. And
   though some of them were hurt, yet he noticed how bravely they stood by
   him through the service. He thought it a token for good that children
   drank in his words. When God moves the children to earnestness, He will
   soon move their fathers and mothers! When boys and girls meet to praise
   God, do not despise their little meetings, nor say, "It is only a
   parcel of children." The children are, in God's esteem, the most
   precious portion of the race! He sets high store by His little ones and
   He has set a special curse upon those who offend one of the little ones
   that believe in Him. Jesus, Master, come, we pray You! Come in Your
   lowly pomp, in all Your gentleness and Grace, and then will the
   children of these modern days sing loud Hosannas to Your name, like
   those in Your Temple of old.

   I want you to notice in our text that our Savior was received with the
   shout of Hosanna! The best interpretation I can give is--"Save, oh,
   save! Save, oh, save!" Different nations have different ways of
   expressing their good will to their monarchs. A Roman would have
   shouted, "Io triumphe!" We sing, "God save our gracious Queen." The
   Persians said, "O King, live forever." The Jews cried, "Hosanna!"
   "Save," or, "God save the King!" The French have their "Vivas," by
   which they mean, "Long live the man." Hosanna is tantamount to all
   these. It is a shout of homage, welcome and loyalty. It wishes wealth,
   health and honor to the king. In the Saxon we say, "Hurrah." In Hebrew,
   "Hosanna." That mighty shout startled all the streets of the old
   city--"Hosanna, Hosanna, the King is come! Save Him, O Lord! Save us
   through Him! Long live the King!" While it was a shout of homage, it
   was also a prayer to the King. "Save, Lord; save us, O King! O King,
   born to conquer and to save, deliver us!" It was, moreover, a prayer
   for Him--"God save the King, God bless and prosper His Majesty. "Prayer
   also shall be made for Him continually; and daily shall He be praised."
   We never cease to pray, "Your Kingdom come; Your will be done in earth,
   as it is in Heaven." Let us then cry, Hosanna, making it at once a
   loyal shout! A prayer to our King and a prayer for Him. All these
   things appear in the benediction which follows, "Blessed is He that
   comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest."

   Would it be amiss if we were to indulge in a hearty shout for our King?
   May we never grow enthusiastic? May we never overleap the bounds of
   prim propriety? Shall we never cry Hallelujah! Shall no Hosannas burst
   from our lips? Surely, if our King will come into the midst of His
   Church, again, and end these black days of doubt, we must and will
   shout, or else the very stones will cry out! Yes, O Lord Jesus, You
   shall have our Vivas: we will shout, "Long live the

   King!"--

   "All hail the po wer of Jesus 'name! Let angels prostrate fall."

   Nor will we cease to pray to You! Some of you that have not yet been
   saved by Him will, I trust, say, "Save me, Lord! O Jesus, save me!" You
   will not disturb but delight the present meeting if you will in your
   hearts cry, "Lord, save me!" Remember the cry of two blind beggars on
   this very journey of our Lord--and how He opened their eyes when they
   cried, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"

   Will we not also put up prayer for our Lord this morning? Will not each
   one in his pew now breathe a petition to God, saying, "Father, glorify
   Your Son"? You have said that the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
   His hands--make it so. O Jehovah, You are well pleased with Jesus; show
   Your good pleasure towards Him by giving Him to conquer ten thousand
   times ten thousand hearts! Let a nation be born in a day. May He reign
   forever and ever! Hosanna! Hosanna!

   III. I have only a little time for my third point, and yet it is of
   great importance--CHRIST RECEIVED IN THE HEART. His triumphant ride
   into Jerusalem was a type of His entering the renewed heart. I pray
   that you who have never received Him may listen and may, by the
   listening, be led to pray for His coming into your heart.

   On that day, when Christ came up from Bethany, the city gates were wide
   open. We read nothing about them because they were not in the
   way--there were no shut gates to Him. He rode into Jerusalem without
   let or hindrance. Are your gates wide open this morning? If not, I
   would say, "Lift up your heads, O you gates; and be you lift up, you
   everlasting doors: and the King of Glory shall come in." He is willing
   to abide in your hearts and go no more out forever--be sure that your
   gates are set wide before Him! May the Holy Spirit open your hearts! Do
   not tolerate the thought of shutting out your Lord. Never! Open wide
   the portals of your soul. Yes, go forth by willing obedience and say,
   "Come in, my Lord! Come in!"

   He was cheerfully received as King. Our Lord did not come to subdue the
   citizens at the point of the sword. He did not come with force of arms
   to coerce the city. You must receive Jesus willingly, or not at all. He
   comes to reign, but He comes in the gentleness of love. He rides on no
   high-mettled charger. He lays His hand on no sharp sword which clatters
   at His side. About Him are no men-at-arms. Behind Him come no heavy
   guns, dragged along the trembling streets. Jesus was willingly
   received--everyone exultingly welcomed Him. Will you so receive Jesus?
   Has He made you willing in the day of His power? You may well salute
   Him and welcome Him to your heart and your home, for you have never
   before received so blessed a guest! Open wide the gates and entreat Him
   to come in, for He will bring Heaven with Him. He never uses force. He
   conquers only by love. The Holy Spirit works upon the will of man, but
   He still leaves it a will, so that we freely choose our Lord and
   delight in Him as our King!

   Remember, Beloved, the coming of Christ is with gentleness and love.
   Riding on a colt, the foal of a donkey, is a very different thing from
   riding the fiery warhorse. I like not men who seem as if they were
   converted, to hate everybody else. It is not Christ who has come unto
   you if you have grown prouder, harder, more passionate than ever. No,
   the Christ who enters to save is, Himself, so meek and lowly of heart
   that those who take His yoke upon them learn of Him--and they become
   meek and lowly, too. Admit the lowly Christ and be of one mind with
   Him. He will kill your bad temper, conquer your malice and cast out
   your pride! Come and be the willing subject of a King who rides forth
   in lowliest guise.

   His entrance caused great joy. No man's heart was made heavy that day.
   The face of the King frowned on none. Other kings have found it
   necessary to force their way through crowds of rebels to their capital
   and wade through slaughter to a throne--but none was found to hurt or
   devour in all the holy mountain when Jesus came to Zion! Women have
   been ravished, men have been murdered--even babes have been massacred
   when monarchs have entered cities--but when our King comes, boughs and
   palm fronds, shouts and songs are the setting of a very different
   scene! Instead of shrieks and groans, we hear the ringing music of
   children with their glad Hosannas! Oh, will you not admit the Lord
   Jesus? Who will refuse an entrance to One who brings with Him joy and
   peace?--

   "He shall come down like showers Upon the fruitful earth! Love, joy,
   and hope, like flowers, Spring in His path to birth!"

   When He comes, men feel a burning enthusiasm for Him. It should not be
   necessary that I should plead for His admission. Surely you should run
   down the hill to meet Him and then come back, following after Him with
   glad Hosannas! Lord Jesus, we cannot be cold in Your Presence! Our
   souls burn as with coals of juniper when we remember You!

   But I must tell you one thing which I am sure will not dampen your
   ardor if you are in a right state. If Jesus comes into your souls He
   will come as a Reformer. He will make your heart a Temple and out of it
   He will drive the buyers and the sellers--and all else that would
   pollute the soul. With His scourge of small cords, He will whip out
   many a naughty thing from the heart which He makes His Temple. Yes, let
   the thieves go! If your heart has been made a den of thieves by evil
   desires, should not these be chased out without mercy? So let it be.
   Welcome, You great Refiner! Gladly would we lose our dross.

   I feel so glad to have to add that when He comes into your heart He
   will heal you. Did I not note it to you when we were reading the 14th
   verse--"The blind and the lame came to Him in the Temple; and He healed
   them." Dear Heart, if Jesus comes to you, all that is blind and lame
   about you shall be healed! That was a singular healing, was it not?
   Many of that select company came on crutches and some with legs doubled
   up, or malformed. Blind men were there, with useless eyeballs or empty
   sockets where eyes should have been. Into this limping, groping circle
   came the King of Glory and He did not repel them, but He healed them!
   Admit the Lord into your heart and the limping of your unbelief will be
   exchanged for the leaps of faith! Then shall you see those things to
   which your heart has long been blind. Let Him in! Let Him in! Believe
   on Him! Trust Him and let Him into your heart--and you shall find Him
   the Physician of your soul.

   Last of all, you that have not yet received Him, we want you to join
   with the rest of us in honoring Him and glorifying Him as He comes into
   your heart. "Oh!" says one, "if He will only come into my heart, I
   will, indeed, praise Him." Have your hosannas ready! Receive the Lord
   Jesus Christ with all honors. Mention His name with rejoicing! Have
   your hurrah ready to welcome the King, the Conqueror, as He enters your
   soul. Be jubilant! Be enthusiastic! Rejoice that such a One as He
   should come to dwell with such a one as you--and bring such blessing
   with Him. Praise Him! Praise Him! Extol Him in the highest heavens!
   Then pray to Him. "Save, Lord! Save, oh, save!" Then pray for others to
   Him in the same words, "Hosanna; save, Lord, save!"

   And when you have done with Hosannas and prayers, conclude, as the
   Psalmist did, in that famous 118th Psalm, when he cried, "Bind the
   sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar." Ask God of His
   love, today, to bind you to Christ, THE Altar, with one of those
   wreaths of love and ribbons of triumphant Grace which you now throw at
   His feet. Oh, for a twisted garland of mercies, the roses of gladness
   and the lilies of delight to bind our heart to Christ forever! These
   cords of love may seem weak, but in very deed they hold us faster than
   chains of steel. Nothing holds a man like the silken cord of gratitude!
   When you know how Jesus loves you--when you see how He died for
   you--then you are drawn to love Him in return and are held to serve Him
   in life, in death and to eternity!

   Thus do we celebrate our Lord's triumphant entrance into the City of
   Mansoul, and we feel that we could prolong the celebration throughout
   the whole of our lives--

   "Yes, we will praise You, dearest Lord, Our souls are all on flame,
   Hosanna round the spacious earth To Your adored name."

Christ's Resurrection and Our Newness Of Life

   (No. 2197)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 29, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore we are buried with Him through baptism into death: that just
   as Christ was raised up from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even
   so we also should walk in newness of life." Romans 6:4.

   I have preached before upon the whole verse, so that this morning I
   shall take the liberty to dwell chiefly upon the latter part of
   it--"Just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
   Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."

   The idea that the Grace of God should lead us to licentiousness is
   utterly loathsome to every Christian. We cannot endure it. The notion
   that the Doctrines of Grace give license to sin comes from the
   devil--and we deny it with a detestation more deep than words can
   express! "How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"

   On our first entrance upon a Christian profession, we are met by the
   ordinance of Baptism which teaches the necessity of purification.
   Baptism is, in its very form, a washing, and its teaching requires
   cleansing of the most thorough kind. It is a burial, in which the man
   is viewed as dead with Christ to sin, and is regarded as rising again
   as a new man. Baptism sets forth, as in a picture, the union of the
   Believer with the Lord Jesus in His baptism of suffering and in His
   death, burial and Resurrection. By submitting to that sacred ordinance,
   we declare that we believe ourselves to be dead with Him because of His
   endurance of the death penalty--and dead to the world and to the
   dominion of sin by His Spirit. At the same time, we also profess our
   faith in our Lord's Resurrection and that we, ourselves, are raised up
   in union with Him and have come forth through faith into newness of
   life. It is a very impressive and vivid symbol, but it is without
   meaning unless we rise to purity of life.

   The basis of this confession lies in the union of every Believer with
   Christ Jesus. We are dead with Him because we are one with Him. We are
   risen with Him because we are one with Him. Every Believer is, in the
   purpose of Divine Grace, identified with Jesus. He was given to the
   Lord Jesus from before the foundation of the world and placed under His
   Covenant Headship. The Lord Jesus suffered for the Believer as his
   Substitute and virtually each saved one died in Christ, who represented
   Him. The Believer rose in Christ by virtue of the eternal union which
   exists between the saint and his Savior. Therefore the Believer
   continues to live, for the Lord has said, "Because I live, you shall
   live also." Our destiny is identified with that of our Covenant Head.
   His life is the model of our experience--He makes us to be conformed to
   His image, now, and we shall be like He when we shall see Him as He is.
   O my Hearer, if you are not in Christ, you have nothing! Out of Christ
   you are in the wilderness--with Him you are in a paradise! In Christ,
   Believers possess all the treasures of wisdom, knowledge, Grace, power
   and love. All things are yours, if you are Christ's. From our union to
   Christ follows our sanctification--we cannot follow after sin, for
   Christ does not follow after it. He died unto sin, once, and we are
   henceforth dead to it. He is risen by the Glory of the Father and we
   are risen with Him into righteousness, acceptance andjoy!

   I. Follow me in the text, taking as your first thought the fact that
   THE RESURRECTION OF OUR LORD WAS ATTENDED WITH GLORY--He was "raised up
   from the dead by the Glory of the Father." Christ's Resurrection is
   linked with the fullness of eternal Glory.

   In itself it was a great marvel. Our Lord was assuredly dead--the Roman
   guards at the Cross took care that no condemned person escaped the
   death penalty. In our Lord's case, His heart was pierced with a spear
   to make sure that no life remained in Him. Joseph begged for His body
   and, by the loving hands of those who were sure that He was dead, He
   was

   wrapped in spices and fine linen--and laid in the rocky tomb. There lay
   our Lord, in the grave, with a stone rolled at the cave's mouth and a
   seal set upon it by those in authority, whose envy made them take
   double precautions. As when a prince lies slumbering in his pavilion he
   is watched by a guard, so was our Lord's sepulcher watched by a guard
   of Roman soldiers, so that no man might steal His body. There He lay in
   the heart of the earth for a portion of three days and nights. He was
   really dead and in the grave. He wore all the marks of decease--a
   napkin was bound about His head, and the linen clothes rapped His
   limbs. On the morning of the third day it was truly said, "The Lord has
   risen, indeed," for He actually, literally and in very fact awoke to
   life, unbound the napkin and laid it by itself, leisurely folded His
   grave clothes and, when the angel had rolled away the stone from the
   mouth of the sepulcher, the First-Begotten from the dead came forth in
   a material body to live among His disciples for forty days!

   During the time of His sojourn, His Resurrection was established by
   many Infallible proofs--He was seen, heard, touched and handled. One of
   His disciples put his finger into the print of the nails and thrust his
   hand into His side. He possessed a real body, for He ate a piece of a
   broiled fish and of a honeycomb before them all. It was Jesus of
   Nazareth and, none other than He, who met His disciples at Galilee! On
   this firm basis of fact we build our holy faith, but, certain as it is,
   it is none the less a marvel. All Glory be to Him "that brought again
   from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through
   the blood of the Everlasting Covenant."

   The Resurrection of our Lord is glorious in contrast with His
   humiliation. It has in it sufficient Glory to redeem His passion from
   the shame which gathered about it. We read in Matthew 20:18, 19, how He
   was to be betrayed, condemned to death, delivered to the Gentiles,
   mocked, scourged and crucified. But we note that all the gloom of that
   dread tragedy is removed by the few words with which our Lord ended the
   story--"And the third day He shall rise again." The blaze of
   Resurrection lights up the whole length of the Valley of the Shadow of
   Death! His death wears no dishonor on its brow, for His rising again
   has set a diadem thereon! We celebrate Gethsemane and Calvary--and find
   no bitterness in all their grief--because death is swallowed up in the
   victory of Resurrection! The whole earthly life of Jesus, with its
   poverty, its slander, its sorrow, its scourging, its spitting, its
   crucifixion, is raised above all trace of dishonor by His glorious
   Resurrection!

   His resurrection is glorious in its effects. He was "delivered for our
   offenses," but, "He was raised again for our justification." In death
   He discharged our debt. In Resurrection He exhibited the receipt of all
   our liabilities! He was Surety for us and, therefore, He smarted and
   went down to the prison of the grave. But by death He discharged His
   Suretyship and was set free! Our Lord has risen and, therefore, we
   shall rise in the day of His appearing. The Breaker leads the way and
   behind the mighty champion the whole company of His redeemed pass
   through the portals of the tomb in the power of His Resurrection. The
   stone is rolled away for them as well as for Him. They cannot be held
   by the bonds of death, for He could not be detained a captive. What a
   glory there is in our Lord's Resurrection, when we further remember
   that He always lives to make intercession for us and, therefore, He is
   able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him! The
   fullness of salvation comes to us because He has risen from the dead
   and is now making intercession for the transgressors! O Brothers and
   Sisters, the Resurrection of Jesus is bright as the sun with glory!
   Faith in it thrills our hearts. Well might each line of our hymn end
   with a Hallelujah! When we say, one to another, "The Lord is risen,
   indeed," we feel like singing all the time, for now our faith is not
   vain, we are not in our sins and those who have fallen asleep have not
   perished!

   Our Lord's Resurrection was glorious as to its cause, for it was a
   display of the Glory of the Father. For "glory" you may read, "power,"
   if you please, for it was a great work of power to raise Jesus from the
   dead. But it was more than a miracle of power, for all the attributes
   of God united their Glory in the Resurrection of Christ. God's Love
   came there and opened those closed eyes. His delight bejeweled those
   deadly wounds. His Wisdom set in motion that pierced heart. Divine
   Justice claimed His loosing from the grave and Mercy smiled as she lit
   up His face with an immortal smile! Then and there did Jehovah make all
   His Glory to pass before us and He proclaimed the name of the Lord. If
   you ask where God's Glory is most seen, I will not point to creation,
   nor to Providence, but to the raising of Jesus from the dead! It is
   true that in the silence of the tomb there were no spectators, but God
   Himself was there. After the deed was done, there were many who beheld
   His Glory and when at the close of His sojourn, below, He ascended
   beyond the clouds, all Heaven came forth to meet Him and to behold the
   conqueror of Death and Hell! In His Resurrection the Glory of God was
   laid

   bare. The veil which concealed the sacred Presence was torn from top to
   bottom and the Glory of the Lord was seen in the Resurrection of Christ
   from the dead!

   That Resurrection is glorious because of its sequel in reference to our
   Lord. Of this I have already spoken in measure. Only let me remind you
   that He rose to die no more. Once has He suffered, but it is once and
   for all! His victory is final. Like Samson, the fierce lion of Death
   roared upon Him in the vineyard. The monster had, up to then, overcome
   everyone whom he assailed, but this time he met his match! Our greater
   Samson rent him as though he were a kid and though our Deliverer fell
   in the act of victory, He rose from the death struggle with fullness of
   life! Behold, He comes to us, today, bearing handfuls of honey on which
   He bids us feed. He has taken it from the carcass of the lion which He
   slew. Now is death a store of sweets rather than a cup of gall! To the
   child of God death furnishes a couch of rest and is no longer a dark
   and noisome prison cell. Death is the refining pot for this poor flesh
   and blood--the body is sown in corruption, but it is raised in
   incorruption and immortality!

   We shall with these eyes behold our Lord when He shall stand in the
   latter day upon the earth! O glorious Resurrection, which has turned
   our poison into medicine! O miracle of Love, which has made death to be
   the gate of life! When you were singing the Easter hymn just now, it
   seemed to me as if we filled the whole earth with silver bells. And
   when you came to the last verse, you were so fully getting into the
   music of the Truth of God, that I had half a mind to cry, "Let us begin
   again!" In the rising of Jesus, death itself is shut up in prison, and
   ten thousand Hallelujahs come flying down from Heaven to teach us how
   to sing--

   " Vain the watch, the stone, the seal! Christ has burst the gates of
   Hell. Death in vain forbids Him rise, Christ has opened Paradise.'

   II. Let me introduce you to our second point, which is this--THE
   PARALLEL IN OUR EXPERIENCE IS ALSO FULL OF GLORY. When the time of love
   had fully come, we also rose as to our spirits, that, "like as Christ
   was raised up from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also
   should walk in newness of life." Partakers of His death, we are also
   partakers of His Resurrection! This body of ours will have its share in
   that blessing of adoption in due time. As yet, it remains subject to
   pain, weakness and death, for it is as the Apostle puts it, "If Christ
   is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life
   because of righteousness." The spirit has its resurrection even now,
   but we are "waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our
   body." At the Second Coming of the Lord, the dead shall be raised
   incorruptible and the living shall be changed. We have the first-fruits
   of the Spirit, inasmuch as we are spiritually risen from the dead--and
   the rest will follow in due course.

   It is a blessed thing that we should be made alive in Christ. As many
   of you as have believed in the Lord Jesus have been raised from among
   the dead. You were once without faith and without feeling. You had no
   sense of sin. You had no desire after holiness. You had no confidence
   in Christ. You had no love for the Father, but, "you has He quickened,
   who were dead in trespasses and sins." You live now even as Jesus lived
   when He was "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
   Spirit of holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead." Why should the
   Lord of Life have raised you from your death? Multitudes around you are
   still dead! You could not have made yourselves alive, for it is clear
   that the dead cannot rise by their own power. You were like the dry
   bones of Ezekiel's valley, without even the form or the moisture of
   life! You were more difficult to quicken than your Savior's body, for,
   "He saw no corruption," but you were corrupt of heart. Ah, how much you
   saw of corruption! In you has Jehovah repeated the miracle which He
   performed on His beloved Son!

   Remember that quickening is a necessary part of the process of
   sanctification. Sanctification, in its operation upon our character,
   consists of three things. First, we die to sin. A wondrous death! By
   this Jesus strikes at the heart of evil. The death of Christ makes us
   die to sin. After this comes burial. We are buried with Christ and of
   this burial, Baptism is the type and token. Covered up to be forgotten,
   we are to sin as a dead shepherd to his flock. As the sheep pass over
   the dead shepherd's grave, or even feed thereon, yet he regards them
   not--so our old sins and habits come about us, but we, as dead men,
   know them no more. We are buried to them! To complete our actual
   sanctification we receive heavenly quickening. "If we are dead with
   Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him." Yes, we do live
   in Him and by Him, for, "He that believes in Him has everlasting life."
   I trust you know what this means. Have you been thus dead, thus bur-

   ied with Christ? Are you now thus quickened in the likeness of His
   Resurrection? This is your joyful privilege if you are, indeed,
   Believers in Christ and joined unto the Lord in one spirit.

   Being thus quickened you are partakers of a new life. You are not like
   Lazarus, who, when he was raised from the dead, had the same life
   restored to him. True, you have that same life about you. Alas, that
   you should have it! For it will be your burden and plague. But your
   true life has come to you by your being born again from above. "This is
   the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in
   His Son. He that has the Son has life." The Holy Spirit has worked in
   us a higher life than Nature possessed. "We know that whoever is born
   of God sins not, but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that
   Wicked One touches him not." We have received "a living and
   incorruptible seed which lives and abides forever." In this there is a
   striking display of the Glory of God. As in the Resurrection of Christ
   we see all the glorious attributes of God, so is there in every
   Believer's spiritual quickening a manifestation of the Divine Presence.
   I know not how much there is of God in the regeneration of each
   new-born soul, but I do know this, that God likens it to a new creation
   and to the Resurrection and, therefore, we may be sure that it is one
   of the highest displays of Divine Power.

   We talk of conversion, but how lightly do we estimate the full meaning
   of it! Know you not that regeneration is one of the greatest miracles
   that God Himself can perform? To be begotten again unto a lively hope
   is a mass of wonders! We who before lay under spiritual death, have
   become possessors of a heavenly life--who can fully comprehend this?
   This is a miracle, indeed, and we ourselves are the subjects of it!
   Surely we do not think highly enough of the notable deed which has been
   worked upon our impotent selves. Lazarus raised from the dead was the
   object of wonder to everybody. The Jews came to Bethany, not to see
   only Jesus, but to see Lazarus, who was raised from the dead. What must
   Lazarus have thought of being thus brought back from the land of
   darkness to visit, again, the haunts of men? Lazarus must have felt
   himself a strange and singular man--even his sisters, Mary and Martha,
   could not understand his experience. Christian, you have felt what you
   can never tell--you have received what you can never explain--you
   possess a secret something which can never be set forth in words! God
   help you to show it by your life!

   In this parallel of our history with the story of Christ, in our being
   spiritually raised from the dead, we have a preeminent security for
   future perfection. "He that has worked us for the same thing is God,
   who also has given us the earnest of the Spirit." If He raised us up
   when we were dead in sin, will He not keep us alive, now, that we live
   unto Him? If He called us out of our graves when we were under the
   bondage of death, will He not preserve us, now, by the life of Him that
   dies no more? If the life of God has really been infused into us, who
   shall destroy it? Has not our Master said, "I give unto My sheep
   eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
   them out of My hand"? He would not have given us this life unless He
   had intended to bring it to perfection! As surely as you live by the
   Father, you live as Jesus does, beyond the range of further death! "Sin
   shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the Law, but
   under Grace."

   Do you tremblingly ask me, "May I not go back unto sin?" Listen to
   this! It is written in the Covenant, "I will put My fear in their
   hearts, that they shall not depart from Me." The life which is in you
   springs up unto eternal life. You shall surely behold His face whose
   life is already within your breast. What a blessed thing is this! I
   cannot declare to you the measureless Glory of God which I perceive in
   this quickening of souls unto God and yet, that which I perceive is the
   bare fringe of the Glory. He might have left us to our corruptions and
   then, at last, He would have said, "Bury My dead out of My sight.
   Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
   devil and his angels." But instead thereof, in His free love, He has
   come in the Person of His dear Son and died for us that we might die in
   Him and He has quickened His Son that we should live in Him! Soon He
   will say, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared
   for you from the foundation of the world." Wondrous Grace! "He that
   sits on the Throne says, Behold, I make all things new." And never is
   He to our hearts more truly on the Throne of God than in this new
   creation of which we are this day the happy subjects--

   "Raised from the dead, we live anew; And, justified by Grace,

   We shall appear in Glory, too, And see our Father's face.

   If I gave you only those two things to dwell upon, you might, by God's
   blessing, find a good Sabbath's meal in them. God sanctify this
   teaching to all our hearts!

   III. But now I want your special attention while I notice, in the third
   place, that THE LIFE THEN GIVEN IS EMPHATICALLY NEW. Read our
   text--"Just as Christ was raised from the dead by the Glory of the
   Father"--I expected that we should then read, "even so we also should
   be raised by the Glory of the Father." But it is not so. Paul sometimes
   takes great leaps of thought. It is in his mind that we are raised
   together with Christ, but his thought has gone further, even to the
   activity which comes of life--and we read, "that we also should walk in
   newness of life." As much as to say, "I need not tell you that you have
   been quickened as Christ was, but since you have been made alive, you
   must show it by your walk and conduct." But he reminds us that this
   life has much newness about it.

   "Newness of life"--what does it mean? It means this. When we are born
   again and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ--which things take place at
   the same time--we receive a life which we never before possessed. We
   begin to feel, to think and to act as we never did before. The new life
   is something foreign to our fallen nature--an exotic, a plant of
   another clime. The carnal mind knows nothing of spiritual things! The
   man who is not born again cannot understand what the new birth means!
   Spiritual things are spiritually discerned and the carnal man is all
   confused in reference to them. In your quickening you received a light
   which had never before shone in your bosom--a life that came not from
   men, neither by men. It is not a development of something which was
   hidden in our constitution. It is not the evolution of a principle
   which really exists, only it is hampered and hindered. No! It is not
   written, "You has He fostered, who had the germs of dormant life," but,
   "You has He quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins." You had
   no life, you had nothing out of which life could come! Fostered you
   might have been, but all the fostering possible would only have
   developed your corrupt nature and caused the evil within to grow at a
   greater rate! No seeds of eternal life lie buried in the dunghill of
   fallen nature! Eternal life is the gift of God!

   This novel life is new in its principles. The old life, at its very
   best, only said, "I must do right that I may win a reward."
   Wage-earning is the principle of the old legal life when it tries to be
   obedient. Now you are moved by gratitude and not by a mercenary motive.
   I hear you sing--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again With love intense I burn: Chosen of Him
   ere time began, I choose Him in return."

   You now serve, not as a hired servant, but as a loving child. Grace
   reigns! The love of Christ constrains you. It is your joy to obey out
   of love and not from slavish fear.

   This life is swayed by new motives. You now live to please God--before
   you lived to please yourself, or to please your neighbors. Once you
   lived for what you could get for yourself--you lived for the passing
   pleasures of a fleeting life, but now you have launched upon eternal
   seas. Eternity holds your treasures! Eternity excites your efforts and
   elevates your desires. You live as seeing Him who is invisible and your
   conduct is controlled, not by the judgment of fallible men, but by the
   rule of the heart-searching God!

   Your new life has new objectives. You aim higher, yes, you aim at the
   highest of all, for you live for the Glory of God and seek that your
   light may so shine "that men may see your good works and glorify your
   Father which is in Heaven." The will of God has now become your law.
   You count yourself only happy as you may fulfill His purposes, honor
   His name and extend His Kingdom.

   Your inner life has made you conscious of new emotions. You feel now as
   you were not known to feel. Your fears are new, your hopes are new,
   your sorrows are new and your joys are new. If you were to meet your
   old self you would not wish to strike up an acquaintance with him, but
   would rather walk on the other side of the street! When I meet my
   former self I always quarrel with him, and he with me. I grieve to
   confess that I find another law in my members warring against the law
   of my mind and seeking to bring me back into captivity. Behold, all
   things are new to us! One said to me, when I asked her what kind of
   change she had undergone--"Either the world is quite altered, or else I
   am." Yes, Friends, the light is changed because our eyes are opened to
   it! We feel the very opposite of what we felt by nature.

   Now are we cheered by new hopes--we have a hope of immortality--a hope
   so glorious that it causes us to purify ourselves in preparation for
   its realization! We wait for the glorious appearing of our Lord! We
   look for new heavens and a new earth. We have a lively hope which
   defies death.

   Now have we new possessions. We used to wonder what the Christian meant
   when he spoke of "possessing all things." We now know! God has made us
   "rich in faith" and He has given us greater riches than all the
   treasures of

   Egypt. When the Lord lifts up His Countenance upon us, we no longer cry
   for corn and wine and oil. Though flocks die, crops fail, our estate is
   entailed--our bread shall be given us and our waters shall be sure.
   Instead of groaning that life is not worth having, we bless God for our
   being, because of our well-being in Christ. Behold the desert now
   rejoices and blossoms as the rose! Where we heard only the hooting of
   the owl and the cry of the dragon, we hear music as of a song which has
   just begun, which is every moment swelling and increasing--and shall
   soon burst into a thunder of hallelujahs which shall never end! We are
   now happy creatures. Once we were doleful enough, save when we were in
   our cups and inflamed with a delirious mirth, but now we have peace
   like a river and a secret joy which no man takes from us. We drink of a
   well which none can dry up--we have bread to eat that the world knows
   not of. Truly our fellowship is with the Father and this, even to
   ourselves, is so vast a joy that it overwhelms us! When we are nearest
   to God and are absorbed in Him, we cannot comprehend our own delight.

   We have come into a new world altogether--a world far more grand than
   that which Nature reveals. I often compare myself to a chick which
   before was imprisoned in the dark, narrow and uncomfortable prison of
   its natural shell. In that condition I neither knew myself, nor
   anything that was about me, but was in chaos, as one unborn. Do I not
   remember when the shell was broken and I came out into the open? Then,
   like a young bird, I was weak and strange, and full of wonderment at
   the life into which I had come. How strange was it to my soul to have
   the Godhead consciously perceived and Christ and His redemption
   blessedly enjoyed! That young life begins to feel its wings and try
   them a little. It also moves with trembling footsteps, essaying a new
   walk. It sees things it never dreamed of when shut up in the darkness.
   The new-born soul beholds "new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells
   righteousness." That text has come true to some of us--"You shall go
   out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills
   shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the
   field shall clap their hands." It is a wonderful thing, this new life!
   I beg to press home the inquiry, Do you know it? Do you enjoy it? Do
   not boast that you are being educated. Educate the old life as you
   will, it will remain natural and cannot become spiritual. You have
   been, you say, religious from your childhood. Be it so, but even to you
   I must say, "You must be born again." There must be a passing from
   death unto life.

   Does all I am talking about seem to be a confused maze? So far it will
   do you good to know that you do not understand the things of God. To
   know that you are a stranger to the inward life may be a blessing to
   you. It may be that a prayer will spring up in your heart, "Lord,
   implant in me this life." The Lord and Giver of Life is willing to
   bestow it. It is to be had through Jesus, for, to "as many as received
   Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that
   believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of
   the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." May you be born this
   very day into this newness of life!

   IV. I must close, though the subject is sweetly absorbing, and one
   would like to go further into it. Our fourth point

   is this--THE WALK WHICH COMES OUT OF THIS LIFE IS NEW. You were dead,
   but you have been raised from

   among the dead and now you walk in "newness of life."

   The new life that God gives us is exceedingly active. I have never read
   that we are to lie down and sleep in the newness of life. It is true I
   have met with persons who professed to have been saved and, therefore,
   they took matters easily and made themselves religiously comfortable in
   idleness. I greatly question whether you have new life if you do not
   walk! God's children are not of a sluggish race. There is vigor and
   fervency about them. They cannot sleep, as do others. The new life is
   akin to the life of angels--and angels do not spend the day in slumber
   or sloth. I never heard of sluggish angels! They are as flames of fire.
   The new life in a Christian is quick, energetic, forceful. The new life
   produces a holy walk as soon as it is created. If you have been born
   unto God, you have cast off your lethargy and are ready to run the race
   set before you. You may happen to occasionally be dull and sleepy
   through disease, but you will not choose this. When in spiritual
   health, you will glow with Divine ardor and burn with holy fervency,
   delighting yourself in serving the Lord.

   This activity of life induces progress. If we are really quickened, we
   are to walk in newness of life--that is to say, we shall move on. We
   are not to take the goose-step in newness of life, but to march on,
   going from strength to strength. We are not at the end yet--we must
   advance. All that we have already attained is to lead on to the beyond.
   It is true we have the new life in us, but we have not yet obtained
   everything--we must climb higher and go further. The new life grows.

   This walk is to be in newness of life. We are not to act or grow in the
   energy of the old life, but in newness of life. The conduct of a
   Christian is in newness of life and, therefore, others cannot
   understand him because he acts so differently from themselves. But,
   alas, all professors are not of this sort! I see a Christian man coming
   back one evening from a place

   of questionable amusement. Did he go there in newness of life? The old
   man used to go in that direction. When a man is doubtfully honest and
   has made a bargain which will not bear the light--is that done in
   newness of life? When an employer grinds down the workman to the last
   farthing--is that done in the newness of life? Surely, you will see
   what I am aiming at. Brethren, have done with the things of the flesh!
   Put off the old man. If Christ has quickened you, walk in newness of
   life. Say to the old man, "Down with you, Sir! I have done with walking
   in your way."

   Let the new man come to the front and follow his guidance. Say in your
   soul, "O life of God within me, be supreme. Take the upper hand and let
   every thought be captive to your power." Let us not live in oldness of
   spiritual death, but in newness of spiritual life! What a change is
   worked by the perception and possession of better things! Dr. Chalmers,
   in his Exposition of Romans, pictures a man engaged with full and
   earnest ambition on some humble walk of retail merchandise. He cares
   about petty things and makes great account of his little stock-taking.
   His hopes and fears range within his circumscribed trading--he aspires
   to nothing more than to reach a few shillings a week to retire upon.
   But a splendid property is willed to him, or he is introduced into a
   sublime walk of high and honorable adventure. From then on, everything
   is made new! The man's cares, hopes, habits, tastes and desires are all
   new. His expenditure alters. His valuation of money alters. His fear
   about the state of the stock disappears! His joy in the prospect of a
   small competency is no more before his eyes. He has risen to a
   different level altogether. New conditions have silently changed all
   things. The whole man is built on a bigger scale--his house, his table,
   his garments, his company and his speech are all of another sort!

   In the same way, the Lord, by all that He has done for us, and in us,
   has changed everything! No point is unaffected. Newness of life affects
   our manhood from head to foot. The Lord has made us rich in Himself, by
   the gift of Jesus, and by the work of His Spirit--and He would not have
   us grieving and fretting about the little matters which once were so
   exceedingly great to us. "After all these things do the Gentiles seek."
   Let us have higher cares and more Divine aspirations! Let us seek to
   live the life of Heaven on earth! We are called unto righteousness--let
   us not follow after mammon! We are new creatures--may the Lord renew us
   day by day! Let us quit the old, for the time we have spent in it may
   well suffice. Our soul now aspires to a nobler destiny.

   The Christian life should be one of joyful vivacity. We cannot always
   be what we would like to be, especially if we have a sluggish liver or
   an aching head, but I would now speak of our normal condition. The
   Christian man or woman, living in newness of life, should find life
   fresh about him. Our inner man is renewed day by day. A healthy
   Christian is one of the liveliest creatures on earth. When he is at
   work, you may hear him sing. He cannot help it! Do not blame him for a
   little noise. Let him sing and laugh till he cries. Sometimes he cannot
   help it--he will burst if his soul may not have vent. When he begins to
   talk about his Lord, his eyes flash fire. Some people hint that he is
   out of his mind--but those who know best assure us that he was never
   before so sane as now. Of course, the world thinks religion is such
   poor stuff that nobody could grow excited about it. To my mind, cold
   religion is the nastiest dish ever brought to the table! True godliness
   is served up hot. Newness of life means a soul aglow with love to God
   and, therefore, earnest, zealous, happy. Let the believing man have
   space for his larger life, space for his grander joy. No, do not gag
   him--let him sing his new song! If any man out of Heaven has a right to
   be happy, it is the man who lives in newness of life! Come, Beloved, I
   want you to go home today with the resolve that the newness of life
   shall be more apparent in your walk. Do not live the old life over
   again. Why should you? What good would come of it?

   Come, my Soul, if Christ has raised you from the dead, do not live
   after the fashion of the dark grave which you have left. I am not so
   enamored of the sepulcher as to return to it! Walk after the fashion of
   the new life and it will conduct you to God from where it came. Live a
   God-like life--let the Divine in you sit on the throne and tread the
   animal beneath its feet. "It is easier said than done," cries one. That
   depends upon the life within. Life is full of power. I have seen an
   iron bar bent by the growth of a tree. Have you never heard of great
   paving-stones being lifted by fungi which had pushed up beneath them?
   Life is a mighty thing, especially the Divine Life! If you choose to
   contract your souls by a sort of spiritual tight-lacing, or if you
   choose to bend yourselves down in a sorrow which never looks up, you
   may hinder your life and its walk--but give your life full scope and
   what a walk you may have! Yield yourselves fully to God and you shall
   see what you shall see! There is a happiness to be enjoyed by truly
   whole-hearted Believers which some, even of God's own children, would
   think to be impossible!

   Let me finish with a picture which will show you what I mean by
   whole-heartedness. I have seen boys bathing in a river in the morning.
   One of them has just dipped his toes in the water and he cries out, as
   he shivers, "Oh, it's so cold!"

   Another has gone in up to his ankles and he also declares that it is
   fearfully chilly. But look! Another runs to the bank and dives in! He
   rises all in a glow. All his blood is circulating and he cries,
   "Delicious! What a beautiful morning! I am all in a glow. The water is
   splendid!" That is the boy for enjoying a bath! You Christian people
   who are paddling about in the shallows of religion and just dipping
   your toes in it--you stand shivering in the cold air of the world which
   you are afraid to leave! Oh, that you would plunge into the River of
   Life! How it would brace you! What tone it would give you! Dive in,
   young man! Dive in! Be a Christian, out and out! Serve the Lord with
   your whole being! Give yourself wholly to Him who bought you with His
   blood. Plunge into the sacred Flood, by Grace, and you will exclaim--

   "Oh, this is life! Oh, this is joy!

   My God, to find You so!

   Your face to see, Your voice to hear,

   And all Your love to know." May we thus walk in newness of life! Amen.

The Census of Israel

   (No. 2198)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 5, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar, the priest,
   who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan
   near Jericho. But among these there was not a man ofthem whom Moses and
   Aaron, the Priest, numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel
   in the wilderness of Sinai. For the Lordhadsaid of them, They
   shallsurely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of
   them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun."
   Numbers 16:66.

   WE have come to another census, an important stopping place in the
   march of a nation's history. This carries our thoughts back to the
   ancient Bible story connected with the chosen people of God. A census
   was taken of the tribes of Israel in the wilderness two years after
   they had left Egypt. It only numbered males who were over twenty--the
   men capable of active service in war. By thus taking a census of His
   people, the Lord showed that He valued each one of them. They were
   registered by their families and by their names, thus were they
   personally enrolled in the family book of the living God and He thus,
   in effect, said to each one of them, "I have called you by your name;
   you are Mine." By the registration of each man by name, he felt that he
   was not lost in the crowd, but was, by person and pedigree,
   acknowledged as one of those to whom the Lord had promised the land
   which flowed with milk and honey. There was good reason for taking the
   number of the people just as the nation was forming, so that in the
   wilderness they might be arranged, marshaled and disciplined for the
   conflict which lay before them. When commanded of God, because He saw
   that great ends would be served thereby--and when associated with
   redemption--a census was by no means a wrong or a dangerous national
   arrangement. David ordered the people to be numbered, but because his
   motive and his method were wrong, it brought a pestilence on the land
   but, in itself, the taking of a census was a wise and useful thing.

   Thirty-eight years had passed away since the first numbering at Sinai
   and the people had come to the borders of the Promised Land, for they
   were in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. The time had come
   for another census. The wisdom which commanded the counting of Israel
   at the beginning of the wilderness journey also determined to count
   them at the end of it. This would show that He did not value them less
   than in former years. It would afford proof that His word of judgment
   had been fulfilled to them and, moreover, it would marshal them for the
   grand enterprise of conquering the land of Canaan! They were to go
   forth in their armies to fight giant races and armies versed in war.
   They were to dislodge nations from their ancient strongholds and, with
   the sword, destroy guilty aboriginal races which God had condemned to
   destruction. And for this, their military strength needed numbering and
   ordering. Here was good reason for the census, which now, for the
   second or third time, was carefully carried out.

   Our text is from the Book of Numbers and the book well answers to its
   title, for it continually deals with numbers and numberings. The
   numbering on this occasion was not of the women and children or the
   infirm, for the order ran thus, "Take you the sum of all the
   congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and
   upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war
   in Israel." If the numbers of our Churches were taken in this fashion,
   would they not sadly shrink? We have many sick among us that need to be
   carried about, nursed and doctored. Half the strength of the Church
   goes in ambulance service towards the weak and wounded. Another
   diminution of power is occasioned by the vast numbers of undeveloped
   Believers, to whom the Apostle would have said, "When for the time you
   ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again what are
   the first principles of the oracles of God: and are become such as have
   need of milk, and not of strong meat." They should have become men, but
   they remain babes in Grace! They are sadly slow in reaching the
   fullness of the stature of men in Christ Jesus. How many are quite
   unable to bear arms against the foe, for they need to be, themselves,
   guarded from the enemy! To revise the Church rolls so as to

   leave none but vigorous soldiers on the muster roll would make us break
   our hearts over our statistics. May the Lord send us, for this evil,
   health and cure!

   When the second census was taken, it was found that the people were
   nearly of the same number as at the first. Had it not been for the
   punishment so justly inflicted upon them, they must have largely
   increased. But now they had somewhat diminished. They were a rapidly
   increasing people when they were in Egypt--the more they were
   afflicted, the more they multiplied! The family of Jacob increased at a
   marvelous rate from the time of the going down into Egypt to the time
   of leaving that land. This was changed during the 40 years of the
   wilderness, for the whole of the grown men who came out of bondage were
   judged unfit to enter into the Promised Land because of unbelief. And
   these, dying away rapidly, the people scarcely maintained their number.
   It is of God to multiply a nation, or a Church. We may not expect any
   advance in our numbers if we grieve the Spirit of God and if, by our
   unbelief, we drive Him to declare that we shall not prosper. Israel's
   growth ceased for 40 years--may it never be so with us as a Church! We
   would say with Joab, "Now the Lord your God add unto the people, how
   many soever they be, an hundredfold." May the righteous seed multiply
   and replenish the earth, and subdue it, till their number shall be as
   countless as the sands of the shore, or as the stars of the sky!

   Concerning the second census of Israel, I would speak with you, since
   this is the morning of the day on which our British census is to be
   taken. May we gather lessons of wisdom from the theme!

   I. First, observe with interest and with a design to be profited--THE
   NOTABLE CHANGE WORKED AMONG THE PEOPLE BY DEATH. "But among these there
   was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron, the priest, numbered, when
   they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai."

   They answered to their names, 600,000 and more of them--and there they
   stood in their ranks, full of vigorous life. About 40 years had passed
   away and if these same names had been read out, not a man save Caleb
   and Joshua could have answered to the roll call. The entire mass of the
   nation had been changed! The old ones were all gone. All that stood in
   their places by the Jordan were men who were under age at the first
   census, or who were not even born at that time. "Not a man of them"
   remained, says the text. And it repeats the statement--"There was not
   left a man of them."

   Such changes strike us as most memorable. They must not be passed over
   without remark. In the course of 40 years, my Brothers and Sisters,
   what changes take place in every community, in every Church, in every
   family! A friend showed me, last Thursday, a photograph of myself in
   the midst of my first deacons. It was taken scarcely 38 years ago and
   yet, of the entire group, only I survive! Those associates of the
   youthful preacher have all gone to their reward. We have likenesses of
   other groups of Church officers of a later date, in which I am placed
   in the center, and I am there still, but nearly all of those who once
   surrounded me have gone Home. Those who were our leaders in our days of
   struggle--and who saw the hand of God with us in those first years--are
   growing few in number. We have not yet completed the 40 years, but when
   we have done so, the words of our text will be almost literally
   applicable to our case as a Church.

   The going and the coming, the adding and the taking away have changed
   the texture of this fabric and no thread will soon be left. Surely the
   Lord would have us notice this, that we may apply our hearts unto
   wisdom. A costly operation, involving so many sorrows, is not to be
   passed over without thought. Beloved, we, too, are passing away! The
   pastor and his present helpers must, themselves, be summoned Home in
   due course. The march of the generations is not a procession passing
   before our eyes, while we sit, like spectators, at the window, but we
   are in the procession ourselves, and we, too, are passing down the
   streets of time and shall disappear in our turn. We, too, shall sleep
   with our fathers, unless the Lord shall come speedily. I hear a clarion
   blast sounding out from the graves which lie behind us--"Be you also
   ready!" From the last closed sepulcher there comes the prophetic
   warning, "Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live."

   This change was universal throughout the whole camp. There was a change
   even in the enumerators. The Sinai census had been taken by Moses and
   Aaron and now Moses remains just long enough to take his leading place,
   but his brother, Aaron, is not there. The High Priest of God has gone
   up to Mount Hor, has been stripped of his garments, has been buried and
   mourned by all Israel--and now Eleazar, his son, stands before the Lord
   in his father's place. It was so among the other priests and Levites
   and elders of the people. There was change everywhere--among the
   poorest dwellers in that canvas city and among the princes who dwelt
   beneath the standards of the tribes, all had changed. "There was not
   left a man of them."

   Thus is it among ourselves--no offices can be permanently held by the
   same men--"They are not suffered to continue by reason of death." No
   position, however lofty or lowly, can retain its old possessor. It is
   not only the cedars that

   fall, but the fir trees feel the axe. "There is no discharge in that
   war." That same scythe which cuts down the towering flower among the
   grass also sweeps down whole regiments of green blades. See how they
   lie together in long rows, to wither in a common decay! Throughout the
   whole body, this change is gradually taking place. No man can climb the
   rock of immortality and sit there, amid the seething sea, and say to
   Death, "Your waves cannot reach me here!" Though vigorous in health,
   though sound in constitution, though guarded by all the armor of the
   science of health, you, too, must fall by the arrows of the insatiable
   archer. "It is appointed unto men once to die."

   The change is inevitable. Man that is born of woman must be of few
   days. If it had not been for the great sin of Israel at Kadesh, many of
   the people might have lived to the second census and beyond it. But
   even then, if by reason of strength their lives had been lengthened,
   yet would they soon have died out in the ordinary course of nature. If
   40 years had not been appointed as the end of that generation, yet
   without that appointment they would all have passed away in another 20
   or 30 years. As Moses said in his wilderness Psalm, "The days of our
   years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they
   be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is
   soon cut off, and we fly away."

   We must soon quit our tents for the last battle. When the conscript
   number shall be drawn, we may escape this year and next, but the lot
   will fall upon us in due time. There is no leaping from the net of
   mortality wherein, like a shoal of fish, we are all enclosed. Unless
   our Lord shall soon appear, we shall each one find a grave, for, as the
   wise man says, "All are of the dust, and all turn to dust again." "We
   must necessarily die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot
   be gathered up again." Therefore we wisely bow before the stern decree
   and yield ourselves to death.

   But let us not forget that all this change was still under the Divine
   control. Though the people must pass away, yet still, the Lord's hand
   would be in each death and its surroundings. If not a sparrow falls to
   the ground without our Father's knowledge, we may rest assured that no
   man dies without the will of God--no man is carried to his long Home
   unless the Lord has said, "Return, you children of men."--

   "What can preserve my life, or what destroy? An angel's arm can't
   snatch me from the grave-- Legions of angels can't confine me there."
   To create and to destroy are sole prerogatives of the King of Kings!
   Till He speaks the word, we live not, or, living, we die not. Walking
   in the midst of 10,000 stricken with the plague, we are safe till God
   appoints our removal. Concerning those that are asleep, we know that
   they have not died without the will of our Father. Concerning our time,
   also, we know that we shall not be the toys of chance, or the victims
   of fate. A wise and loving God fixes the date and place of our decease,
   for, "precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints."
   Stern though the work may be, His great and tender heart rules the
   ravages of death! Let us, therefore, be comforted concerning the great
   changes which death is working. Here is no cause for tears, as though
   we were left in a monster's power and bereft of a Father's care. The
   Lord is still ruling and nothing happens save as He appoints.

   Moreover, the change was beneficial. It was well that the first
   generation should die in the wilderness. The people who had been
   accustomed to servitude in Egypt had acquired the vices of slaves--and
   when they came out of the house of bondage they were fearful,
   fickle--the creatures of appetite and the victims of panic, selfishness
   and discontent. They had all the vices of subject races and were,
   alike, destitute of manliness and self-control. They were soon cowed by
   fear and baffled by difficulty. They were easily persuaded and as
   easily dissuaded. They were a people of whom nothing could be made.
   Even the Divine tuition in which Moses and Aaron were engaged and in
   which miracles, and types, and laws were employed, could not teach them
   anything so that they really knew it. To make a nation which could
   preserve the worship of the one God in the world, the generation which
   came out of Egypt must die out. The taint of slavery and idolatry must
   be lessened if it could not be quite removed.

   It was desirable that there should be a people trained in a better
   school, with a nobler spirit, fit to take possession of the promised
   land. The change was working rightly--the Divine purpose was being
   fulfilled. Maybe we do not think thus of the changes which are taking
   place in the communities to which we belong. We scarcely think that
   better men are coming on--we even fear that the coming race is weaker
   than the present, but then, we are not fair judges, for we are
   prejudiced in favor of our own generation! I do not doubt that God
   means well to His own Church and that the accomplishment of His eternal
   purposes requires that men should come and go and thus the face of
   society should be changed. It

   is well that the age of man is not so protracted as in the days of
   Methuselah. A teacher influential for error dies and is forgotten. A
   sinner pestilential for vice passes away and the air grows pure.
   Imagine a gambler with 500 years of craft to guide him, or a libertine
   reeking with 600 years of debauchery! Surely the present narrowed
   limits of human life are all too wide for the depraved! We need not
   wish for giants of iniquity such as centuries of life would produce.
   The incoming of new blood into the social frame is good in a thousand
   ways--it is well that we should make room for others who may better
   serve our Master. God grant they may! Our prayer is, "Let Your work
   appear unto Your servants and Your Glory unto their children." We are
   content to take the work if our sons may behold the glory! We are glad
   to move off that they may rise on stepping stones of our ended lives to
   nobler things!

   One other remark I cannot help making and that is that these changes
   are most instructive. If we are now serving God, let us do so with
   intense earnestness, since only for a little while shall we have the
   opportunity to do so among men. "Whatever your hands find to do, do it
   with all your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
   nor wisdom in the grave where you go." Live while you live! At the same
   time, lay plans for influencing the rising generation. Lay yourself out
   to work while it is called today. If anything should be done, it were
   well that it were done quickly. If we wish the Truth of God to conquer
   and the Gospel to prevail, let us fight the Lord's battles now! And if
   we would see Truth prevail after we are gone, let us seek out faithful
   young men who will teach others that the testimony for the Lord God of
   Israel dies not out of the land. We must soon quit the field. Let each
   man set his house in order, for he must soon leave it to be gazed upon
   by strangers' eyes. Let us see that our lifework is rounded off and
   well-finished, so that in the survey of it by our successors they may
   say of us, "He being dead yet speaks." As we must soon be gone from
   among the living, let us bless them while we may. Arise, you saints,
   and bestir yourselves, for the day is far spent and the shadows of
   evening are falling! I pray that we may learn well this first lesson of
   our text. O Spirit of Life, teach us life even by the doings of death!

   II. Secondly, we have here before us THE PERPETUITY OF THE PEOPLE OF
   GOD. There was a change in the

   constituent elements of the Israelite nation, but the nation was still
   there. Not one man was there who was counted 38 years before, save
   Caleb and Joshua, and yet the nation was the same! Do you ask for
   Israel? There it is. Balaam can see the people from the top of the hill
   and they are the same people whom Pharaoh pursued to the Red Sea. The
   nation is living, though a nation has died. It is the same chosen seed
   of Abraham with whom Jehovah is in covenant. God has a Church in the
   world and He will have a Church in the world till time shall be no
   more! The gates of Hell and the jaws of death shall not prevail against
   the Church, though each one of its members must depart out of this
   world in his turn.

   Mark well that "the Church in the wilderness" lives on. There are the
   same 12 tribes, the same standards heading the tribes, the same
   tabernacle in the midst of the host and the same priesthood celebrating
   sacred service with solemn pomp. Everything has changed and yet nothing
   has changed. God has built His holy habitation upon foundations which
   can never be removed! Although the men who bear the Ark of the Covenant
   of the Lord wear other names, yet they fulfill the same office. The
   music of the sanctuary rises and falls, but the strain goes on. The
   hallelujah never ceases, nor is there a pause in the perpetual chorus,
   "His mercy endures forever."

   The gaps were filled up by appointed successors. As one warrior died,
   another man stepped into his place, even as one wave dying on the shore
   is pursued by another. The men were not all swept away at once, but by
   perceptible degrees. Now and then there came an awful and sudden
   destruction, as when Korah, Dathan and Abiram went down alive into the
   pit, but, as a rule, the people dropped off gradually, as ripe fruit
   falls from the trees--and they were succeeded by others as the fading
   leaves of autumn have the buds of spring just beneath them. In the
   Church of God one dies in the order of Nature, but another is born into
   the Kingdom by the power of Divine Grace. We miss some useful Christian
   woman and we lament her, but before many days another Sister is
   prepared of the Lord to serve in her place. Baptism for the dead never
   ceases among us. An honored Brother falls asleep and we carry him to
   the grave and, possibly, we fear no other can do his work and fill the
   vacancy he leaves. Perhaps no one can do the same work, but yet, in
   some other way or form, the work is done! The vines are trimmed, the
   sheep are fed and the lambs are cherished. Not one dead man lies in the
   way to stop the march of the army, as did the corpse of Amasa, which
   lay dead in the road in David's day. The chosen host still marches on!
   Even as the stars in their courses, we still move on. God buries His
   workmen, but His work lives.

   In Israel's case the gap were filled by their own sons. As these men
   passed away, their children took their places. I commend to you, my
   Brothers and Sisters, this fact as your encouragement in prayer for
   your children. Oh, that the Lord

   would pour His Spirit upon our seed and His blessing upon our
   offspring! Oh, that every saint here may be succeeded by his own
   descendants! This is the Lord's frequent way of keeping alive the
   gracious succession. Abraham is gone, but Isaac still kindles the altar
   fire. In a blind old age Isaac is gathered to his fathers, but Jacob
   worships "the Fear of his father Isaac." Jacob gathers up his feet in
   bed, but Judah and Joseph, and the rest of them, continue as salt in
   the earth. Oh, that it may be so in all our families! May we never lack
   a man to stand before the Lord God of Israel to testify for Him! Among
   all the honors that God can put upon our households I think this is the
   greatest, that we should have in our families a succession of saints!
   It is no small privilege to look back and to remember our ancestors who
   feared the Lord--may we also look forward with hope that if this
   dispensation lasts, there may still be some of our name, bearing our
   blood in their veins, who shall be called by Sovereign Grace into the
   service we have loved so well! Search beyond the congregation for new
   converts, but do not forget to look within your own doors for the
   largest accessions to the Church! Hope that your sons and daughters
   after the flesh may be born into "the one family in Heaven and earth,"
   which bears the name of Jesus! Pray that your children may be God's
   children--and may your prayer come up with acceptance into the ears of
   the Lord our God whose mercy is on children's children of them that
   fear Him and keep His Covenant!

   All the offices of "the Church in the wilderness" were filled with
   fitting men. Behold Aaron, in his robes of glory and beauty! What a man
   is he to be the High Priest! With what grace and dignity he presides!
   He dies--will not the priesthood fail? No, my Brothers and Sisters,
   yonder is Eleazar, who occupies his father's place most worthily! Moses
   also passes away. There is none like Moses. He is King in Jeshurun,
   without peer or rival! The Jews have a tradition that when he was
   called to go up to the top of Nebo to die, the people followed him up
   the hill, the women beating on their breasts and bitterly wailing,
   while the strong men bowed themselves with grief and cried, "The father
   of the nation is to be taken away! Alas, what shall we do?" He was bid
   to leave the people on the mountain side and he went up, alone, to the
   place where Jehovah kissed away his soul--and so he passed into his
   rest. Truly it was a great loss, but the Lord found a man to follow
   Moses. Joshua was not equal to Moses in many things and yet, for the
   work he had to do, he was a much more fit man than Moses. The times
   were red with war and Joshua was more able than Moses to fight the
   Canaanites and conquer the land. Joshua was the man for the sword, as
   Moses had been the man of the Book. And God will fill every office in
   His Church, not as you and I might wish, but as His infinite wisdom
   determines. Therefore let us be of good courage and fear no lack.

   At this second numbering, the people stood ready for greater work than
   they had ever done before. The first numbering found them fit for the
   wilderness--the second numbering found them ready for the capture of
   the goodly land and Lebanon. God had been preparing them, by 40 years
   of marching, for their new enterprise and for development into a
   nation. May it please the Lord to make His Church ready for the coming
   of her Lord and for the salvation of nations! If brighter days are
   dawning, the Church will be prepared as a bride for her husband--and if
   tribulation is to come to try all the earth, she shall be strengthened
   as a martyr for the burning! The Lord keeps her lest any hurt her--He
   will keep her night and day.

   It was Israel's joy that God's love was not withdrawn from the nation.
   The Lord still acknowledged the tribes as His people. His Glory was
   still above the Mercy Seat and His fiery, cloudy pillar still guided
   their marching or fixed their stopping. Still the manna dropped from
   Heaven and still they drank of the water from the smitten Rock. Thus
   the Lord still has a Church and it is always the same Church, loved of
   her lord, indwelt by His Spirit and dedicated to His praise. Let us
   take courage--the Church is not destroyed! Many changes take place and
   many sorrows are involved therein, but the Church of God is as always
   as alive as her Immortal Head, who has declared, "Because I live, you
   shall live also." Her stars are still the hope of the world's night and
   her angels are the heralds of the eternal morning! She follows the
   bleeding Lamb who is the Doctrine of her teaching, the Model of her
   acting, the Glory of her hope!

   III. Thirdly, let me bring before your minds THE UNCHANGEABLENESS OF
   THE WORD OF GOD. This we

   perceive in the last verse. "For the Lord had said of them, They shall
   surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them,
   save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun."

   Note how unchangeable are the threats of the Lord. "Among these there
   was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron, the Priest, numbered. For
   the Lord had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness."
   Take note of this, you that think God's Word can fail--you know not
   what you dream! His Words of righteous wrath are not lost--they

   kill as with a two-edged sword. The verse says, "There was not left a
   man of them." Whom the Lord had condemned to die, nothing could keep
   alive. Therefore, do not imagine, O you that obey not the Lord, that
   you shall go unpunished!

   The unbelievers were many, yet not one escaped. "Though hand join in
   hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished." The rebels were a terribly
   large majority, but the crowds in the broad way make it none the safer.
   God has no respect for multitudes--"The wicked shall be turned into
   Hell, and all the nations that forget God." Here they outnumbered the
   faithful more than 10,000 times and yet the justice of God did not
   spare one of them! "There was not left a man of them." How can any of
   you hope to escape? "Your hands shall find out all your enemies." The
   proudest sinner shall be laid low--the thunders of Jehovah shall smite
   down each individual transgressor--and no one shall go away free in the
   day of God's wrath!

   It was a long time before all the sinners died, but the long-suffering
   of God had its limit and, in the end, every rebel died in the
   wilderness. They lived on, some of them, for all the 40 years, but they
   could not pass the boundary. Perhaps they said, "Ah, this ban from God
   will never take effect on us." Yet, before the years were up, the
   survivors of the doomed race had to share the common fate. Not a man of
   those whom Moses and Aaron numbered at Sinai could pass the line of
   fire which closed in the 40 years. God waits, waits in infinite mercy,
   but the punishment of the wicked is none the less sure. "Their foot
   shall slide in due time." The Lord has bent His bow and made it ready,
   and when their hour is come, they shall find that He is not slack
   concerning His Word. Do not, I pray you, doubt the terrible certainty
   of Divine threats because they are long in taking effect. Say not,
   "Where is the promise of His coming?" He will come--and when He comes
   it shall be "in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
   God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   Some of the unbelieving generation were, no doubt, full of vigor, and
   they said, "We are as strong as old Caleb and quite as likely as he to
   cross the Jordan. Our eyes are as clear as those of Moses and we shall
   outlive the 40 years appointed us." But death chilled the coals of
   juniper and quenched their vehement flame. The stalwart man of war laid
   down his weapons, vanquished by the unconquerable foe of men. "There
   was not left a man of them." How like a knell those words sound in my
   ears! The mighty in the day of battle were no longer mighty when their
   hour had come! "They could not enter in because of unbelief." "Their
   carcasses fell in the wilderness." All their days were passed away in
   the wrath of God. Beware, you that forget God, lest He tear you in
   pieces and there be none to deliver. It is vain for you to indulge a
   hope, "larger" or smaller, if you die in your sin! The Justice of the
   Most High is not to be escaped! In that Last Great Day, when the Throne
   shall be set, and every man shall give an account for the things done
   in his body, whether they are good or whether they are evil, the strict
   Judge will, by no means, clear the guilty, but they shall be driven
   away in His wrath to the place where their worm dies not and their fire
   is not quenched!

   Oh that you would flee to Christ for refuge! Look to His Cross, I pray
   you, that you may be saved! As the Lord fulfilled His threats, so did
   He cause His promises to come to pass. Caleb lived on and so did
   Joshua. They were often in danger. Did not the rebels take up stones to
   stone them? They were often near to death--Joshua was
   commander-in-chief of the army and Caleb was a man of war from his
   youth up. They endured the common risks of soldiers, but nothing could
   kill them, for God had promised that they should enter the land! They
   believed God and honored Him by their conduct and, therefore, He kept
   them until the hour came to go in unto the land to possess it. There
   were only two of them, but God did not, therefore, overlook them. He
   keeps covenant with individuals as well as with nations! They were not
   men who kept themselves out of harm's way, neither were they timorous
   and, therefore, afraid to advance their opinions. No doubt they came in
   for a special share of envy and malice, but their reward with God was
   sure. If you believe in Jesus, though you should be the only one of
   your family, yet you shall be saved! Though you know none of your kin
   fear the Lord, yet the God of Israel will not forget the lone one who
   is separated from his brethren. Though the faithful should become so
   few that all the saints together should only make a handful, yet it is
   written, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
   to give you the Kingdom."

   God's Word stands! "The grass withers, and the flower thereof falls
   away: but the Word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the Word by
   which the Gospel is preached unto you." Jehovah's threats and promises
   are of equal force. "Has He said, and shall He not do it?" There shall
   be no change, even, to a jot or tittle in this wondrous Book! God
   forbid that we should begin to doubt it, for if we once begin, where
   shall we end? With this striking confirmation before us, we be-

   lieve that the Word of the Lord must stand. Let us be as the man whom
   the Lord blesses, because, says He, "he trembles

   at My Word."

   IV. Our last point is this--learn from my text THE ABIDING NECESSITY OF
   FAITH. Those people came out of

   Egypt with Moses and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
   the sea when they came forth into the wilderness. One would have hoped
   that they all would march to Canaan, but it was not so. The first
   census is taken. Their names are on the roll. But, sad to say, at the
   next numbering all those names have vanished! What a difference between
   the church roll at Sinai and the Book of Life by Jordan!

   If you profess to be the people of God, we count you among His
   children--you are written among the living in Zion. But what an awful
   thing it would be if your name should not be written in the Lamb's Book
   of Life at the last! What if you should lie on the threshing floor in
   the great heap before the winnowing, but should be gone with the chaff
   as soon as the Lord has come, "whose fan is in His hand"? Oh, that none
   of us may provoke the Lord to swear in His wrath that we shall not
   enter into His rest!

   Learn, first, that no man is, was, or ever shall be saved without
   faith. "He that believes not shall be damned" is our Lord's solemn
   declaration. It is written, "He that believes not is condemned already,
   because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of
   God." This is as true today as when it was first spoken.

   Learn, next, that no privilege can supply the lack of faith. We read
   that they heard, as you do. But some, "when they had heard, did
   provoke." Their provocation lay mainly in their unbelief. No hearing,
   no, not hearing the Apostles, themselves, could save you without faith!
   "The Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in
   them that heard it." Hearing may minister to condemnation if the Truth
   of God is not believed!

   These people went a certain way with Moses towards the Lord's promised
   rest. They did come out of Egypt. They were numbered with Jehovah's
   people in the numbering at Sinai. They were separated from all the
   world in the quietude of the wilderness. But we read there was in them
   "an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God." In heart
   they went back to Egypt! It is not enough to begin well--"he that
   endures to the end shall be saved"--and no other! They had ceremonies
   in abundance, but they were not saved by them. They had the morning and
   the evening lambs. They were circumcised. They ate the Passover. They
   kept the Day of Atonement. But all these things together did not save
   them from dying in the desert, shut out of Canaan by unbelief. "They
   could not enter in because of unbelief." Nothing can make up for the
   absence of faith. They had nothing to do all the day long in the
   wilderness but to learn the lessons of God. They had time for thought
   and they had the best of teachers to instruct them--and the best of
   textbooks in the ceremonial Law--and yet their knowledge did not
   preserve them from leaving their carcasses in the desert! They had
   plenty of time for meditation and contemplation. They had no care about
   temporals, for their bread was given them and their waters were sure.
   And yet, because of absence offaith, they did not learn that elementary
   Truth of God which would have ministered to them an entrance into rest.

   But none perished who had faith--no, not one! All those who believed
   God and held fast to Him, were made inheritors of the land. Caleb and
   Joshua--these two saw the land and took their places in it. If you
   believe, whatever your name may be, you shall be saved, for, "he that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." It is written, "Believe on
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." Caleb and Joshua, by
   faith, entered into the land promised to the fathers and you, my
   Hearer, can only enter in by faith! Have faith in God and you have all
   things! But without faith it is impossible to please God.

   Mark this--while it was faith alone which saved them, faith gave these
   men notable characters. We read of, "My servant, Caleb." He that
   believes God becomes a servant of God and counts it all joy to obey his
   Lord! Faith is the mother of obedience. The Lord said that Caleb "had
   another spirit with him"--faith puts quite another spirit into a
   man--it is not a murmuring or a mutinous spirit. It is not an
   ungrateful or distrustful spirit. Neither is it a haughty, willful,
   rebellious spirit. But it is a spirit of love, of hope, of confidence
   in God. The faithful man is of another spirit from that of the world,
   for the Holy Spirit abides in him! Such a man chooses the way of God,
   so that the Lord says, "He has followed Me fully." This was well--it is
   wise not to run before God, nor to run away from God, but to follow Him
   step by step. It is wise not to follow man, but to wholly follow the
   Lord! It is commendable to follow Him fully with undivided, unwavering,
   unquestioning, untiring steps! The Lord will see that His servant,
   Caleb, enters into His rest--there is rest for good servants. As Caleb
   followed the Lord fully, it was meet that he should enter in where his
   Lord abides. Men of faith are

   not idle men, but servants--they are not wicked men, but they follow
   the Lord. They are not half-hearted men--they follow Him fully. It is
   not their holiness that saves them, but their faith--nevertheless,
   where there is no holiness, there is no fruit of faith and no evidence
   of salvation.

   As for Joshua, he was like Caleb. He was a brave and truthful man, a
   true servant of God. And though we have his life given somewhat at
   length, yet we discover no flaw in his character. It is almost a rare
   thing in the Word of God to find a life written at any length without a
   record of infirmity and sin, for the biographies of Scripture are
   truthful and they mention men's faults as well as their virtues. As
   there is no recorded fault in Joshua's career, we gather that he was of
   a noble character. "The Lord said unto Moses, Take you Joshua the son
   of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand upon him." So
   that the faith which took these two men into Canaan was in them the
   creator of a noble character.

   Now, what do you say, Beloved Friends? Do you believe God? Do you
   believe His Word? Or are you of a captious and dubious spirit? Do you
   believe like children? Is God your Father and, therefore, is His Word
   your Father's Word which you cannot think of questioning? Will you
   follow the Lamb wherever He goes, against giants or Canaanites? Will
   you believe God, whatever may give Him the lie? If so, you shall dwell
   in the land that flows with milk and honey--and you shall have your
   portion when the Lord appears! But if you do not truly believe,
   whatever profession you may make, your carcasses must fall in the
   wilderness! Woe is me that I have to deliver such a prophecy! Greater
   woe to you if it should be fulfilled in you! Believe the Lord and you
   shall prosper.

   This day, as you are preparing for the census of the nation, think of
   the time when God shall make up His last account of natives in His holy
   city. Will you be numbered with His people, or will your names be left
   out at the reading of the muster roll? God give us a place among His
   redeemed--and to His name shall be Glory forever and ever! Amen.

Israel's Hope--Or, The Center of the Target

   (No. 2199)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 19, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and
   with Him is plenteous redemption." Psalm 130:7.

   When he penned this Psalm, the writer, David, was in deep distress, if
   not of circumstances, yet of conscience. He constantly mentions
   iniquities and begs forgiveness. He felt like a shipwrecked mariner,
   carried overboard into the raging sea. Thus he reviews the
   situation--"Out of the depths have I cried unto You, O Lord." Yet he
   lived to tell the tale of deliverance! His prayer from among the waves
   was a memory worth preserving and he preserves it. The mercy of God to
   him he weaves into a song for us--and in this our text is found.

   Two things the rescued sufferer tells us. First, that, as God delivered
   him from the power of sin, so He will deliver all His praying,
   wrestling, believing people. That is the last verse of the Psalm--"He
   shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities." The argument is--He
   delivered me. What am I more than others? The gracious Lord who saved
   me will save all those who call upon Him in truth. He delivered me,
   though laden with iniquities, and His pardoning mercy is unfailing and,
   therefore, He can and will rescue others from their uttermost
   distresses. This is a good line of reasoning, for the Lord's ways are
   constant and He will do for all Believers what He has done for one of
   them.

   The other thing which the Psalmist sets before us is this--we are wise
   if we apply to God, alone, for help. He says, "I wait for the Lord, my
   soul does wait. My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch
   for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning." He
   incidentally tells us that it is vain to wait upon man and put our
   trust in any human support, for the way of deliverance only lies in
   reliance upon God, immediately and alone. We are not to depend upon
   outward means, but upon the God who lends efficacy to all means. Why is
   it that we need to be told of this? Why is faith in God so rare? To go
   first to the Lord is to save time! Straightforward always makes the
   best runner and to go straight to God is not only our duty, but it will
   be our happiest course. The Psalm encourages us to this by the
   assurance that the Lord can and will help all that seek Him--and it
   urges us to let that seeking be distinctly and directly turned to the
   Most High, to Him alone and to none other. To join another ground of
   confidence with the Lord is a sort of practical idolatry which is to
   the wounding of faith.

   May we learn well the lesson of this Psalm! When we meet with a man who
   has been in special trouble and he has escaped from it, we are anxious
   to know how it came to pass in order that if we are cast into similar
   trial, we also may resort to the same door of hope. You meet with a man
   that has long been sorely afflicted--to find him full of joy at his
   relief is a pleasure and a personal comfort! You heard him lamenting
   for years and now you hear him rejoicing--and this excites your wonder
   and your hope! It is as though a cripple saw another lame man leaping
   and running. He very naturally enquires, "How is this?" The other day
   you saw a blind man begging in the street--and now he has eyes bright
   as that which sparkle on the face of a gazelle--and you cry in
   astonishment--"Tell me who was the oculist that operated on your eyes,
   for I may be in the same case and I would be glad to know where to go."
   Here, then, we have a gate of knowledge opened before us. The Psalmist
   found salvation and deliverance in going directly to God and trusting
   in Him! Let us follow his example and in all times of distress, caused
   by our own iniquity, or by anything else, let us repair to the Throne
   of Grace, for the Most High will also deal with us even as He dealt
   with His servant of old, to whose cries, out of the depths, He lent an
   attentive ear. This Psalm is called "De Profundis"-- its teaching is
   not only profound but practical.

   Let me freely speak with you as concerning the great salvation which,
   as fallen creatures, we all need. In that matter our only resort must
   be to God, alone, for, "salvation is of the Lord." God has been
   pleased, in these last days, to reveal Himself in a glorious manner,
   suitable to our salvation. He was always to be seen in creation by
   those whose sight was not darkened by moral evil and, doubtless,
   angelic eyes always beheld Jehovah in all the works of His hands. He
   was to be seen under the old Law in types and shadows and, believing
   men and women were enabled, by the illumination of the Holy Spirit, to
   behold the Lord in His Temple. But in these last days, the Lord has
   spoken to us by His Son, whom He has made heir of all things, and in
   whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. There is the Father
   most clearly to be seen--and now, if we read that Israel is to hope in
   the Lord and if we see that the way of salvation lies in relying upon
   "the Lord"--we must read between the lines and understand that the
   glorious Lord must always be the object of faith according as He, at
   this time, reveals Himself.

   It is written, "They that know Your name will put their trust in You."
   That is to say, they trust, as they know how He reveals Himself. At
   this moment the manifestation of God stands thus--His dear Son has
   descended from the highest heavens and taken upon Himself our human
   nature, so that He is God and Man in one sacred and mysterious Person!
   In that complex form, the Word made flesh dwelt among men on earth some
   30 years and more. And then He took upon Himself the weight of human
   sin and bore it upon His shoulders up to the Cross. He was arrested by
   the hand of Divine Justice and treated by Justice as if He had been a
   sinner, though sinner He could never be. He was numbered with the
   transgressors and given over to wicked men, who, in their willful
   malice, scourged Him, spit upon Him, crowned Him with thorns and
   condemned Him to a felon's death. He died, not for any iniquity of His
   own, but for the transgression of His people was He smitten. The
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him. Yes, "He was made a curse for
   us" and even more--"He was made sin for us, that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him." "He died, the Just for the unjust, that
   He might bring us to God."

   If, then, we would trust God for our personal salvation, we must
   confide in Him as He manifests Himself for that purpose. And as we
   perceive that God sets forth Christ to be the Propitiation for our sin,
   we must accept that ordained way of putting away our sin. This is the
   way in which, "with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous
   redemption." And thus it is that, "He shall redeem Israel from all his
   iniquities." We trust in the Lord God as He reveals Himself in the
   Person of His Son Christ Jesus who has displayed in His own self the
   Love and the Justice of God--and has shown how these were equally
   glorified by the way of redemption through the substitution and
   sacrifice of One who is the Fellow of the Highest, and yet next-of-kin
   to man! Our Lord has buried our sin in His sepulcher and has gone up
   into Heaven to plead, there, with God, for transgressors and, at the
   same time, to prepare a place for as many as believe in Him and so are
   saved by His plenteous redemption! Understand, then, that if we read in
   the text, "Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is
   mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption," we now, today, in the
   light of the Gospel, read it thus--"Let the seeking sinner, who would
   be redeemed from all his iniquities, trust in God as He is seen in and
   through Jesus Christ, for there forgiveness is freely given through
   plenteous redemption, and sin is no longer marked or imputed to the
   Believer, because the sacrifice of Jesus has blotted it out and removed
   it forever."

   This is the introduction of our discourse. May the Holy Spirit now
   grant His anointing both to preacher and hearers!

   I. The chief point to which I desire you to give earnest heed is
   this--in obtaining Gospel blessings, THE FIRST EXERCISES OF FAITH MUST
   BE TOWARDS GOD IN CHRIST JESUS and not towards the blessings,
   themselves. "Let Israel hope in the Lord." We do not read, "Let Israel
   hope for mercy." But we read, "Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with
   the Lord there is mercy." Neither does it say, Let Israel hope for
   plenteous redemption." But it is worded thus, "Let Israel hope in the
   Lord: for with the Lord there is plenteous redemption." To me this has
   the look of a very encouraging Truth of God--the sinner is not to
   hasten with his first thoughts to the mercy that he needs, nor even to
   the promise of God to which he may look--but he is to go to the Lord
   Jesus Christ, Himself, as the Lord of Mercy and Fountain of Redemption!
   The first exercise of our faith is to deal immediately with the Lord
   God as He meets us in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Here let me say that this is the most natural order which faith can
   follow. Look first to the Giver and then to the gift! Look for the
   Helper and then for the help! Do not be saying, "I long to be forgiven.
   I labor to believe that I am forgiven. I desire to be saved. I want to
   know that I am saved." This is looking for the fruit, when you have
   need, first, to find the

   tree! Your first business, as a seeker of pardon and salvation, is to
   believe in Jesus Christ, that is, to trust yourself with the Divine
   Savior. The natural order is believe in the Promiser and then you will
   believe the promise! You never say to yourself, "I should like to be
   able to take that man's word. I will sit down and try to make my mind
   confident of the truth of what he says." This would be a foolish and
   futile method of procedure. You follow a much more reasonable
   course--you enquire about the individual's character and standing--you
   find out who he is, what he is and what he has done. And thus you
   gather arguments for confidence and faith. You cannot help believing
   the promise when once you believe in the promiser. If you find a
   merchant to be an eminently upright and substantial man, you do not
   hesitate to take his checks. In fact, you would be glad to have your
   wallet full of them! Faith prizes the promises of her faithful God, and
   calls them precious.

   Apply this rule and deal with heavenly things in due order. You seek
   pardon. Do not look continually at this priceless mercy at first, but
   look to the pardoning God! You will soon believe in forgiveness if you
   cause the first exercise of your faith to refer to the Forgiver, even
   Christ Jesus, Himself. When you have believed in Him, as able to say,
   "Your sins are forgiven you," then you will believe in sins being
   forgiven! This is the natural order of things. So, also, if you desire
   to believe for salvation and to be assured that you have it, or may
   have it at once, the simple course--the natural course--is to believe
   in the Savior! To be healed, you believe first in the Healer. When you
   have believed in the Savior, then you will believe in the salvation. If
   you know that Jesus can save you; if you desire to be saved, you will
   trust Him to save you. You will be readily able to believe that you can
   be saved when you trust in Jesus as able to save to the uttermost.

   Poor trembling Heart, do not look at the blessing and say, "Alas, it is
   too great!" Look at the Savior Himself! Is anything too great for Him
   to give who gave His heart's blood to redeem? Do not say, "My heart is
   so hard it cannot be changed." Look at the Savior--is anything
   impossible to Him to whom the Father has committed all power? Is He not
   mighty to save? Fix your eyes, first and foremost, upon Him who is both
   God and Man and has, therefore, power and sympathy, majesty and mercy,
   Omnipotence and brotherliness. I pray you, do not consider so much the
   greatness of the effect as the unlimited power of the Cause. I may
   doubt my washing, but not when I believe in the cleansing virtue of the
   precious blood! It may be difficult to believe in my salvation, but not
   to believe in my Savior! It may be hard to hope for Heaven, but the
   text sets me an easier task--"Let Israel hope in the Lord." When I open
   my window God-wards and look towards the Lord Jesus, I see glorious
   things in the light of the rising sun, even things which I could not
   have seen if I had not first turned towards the light. "In the
   beginning God"--this, according to the first chapter of Genesis, is the
   natural order of all Divine work--do not attempt to alter it.

   To this I would add, this is the necessary order. It must be so--the
   Savior first and then the salvation. Suppose, for a moment, that it
   were possible for you to obtain pardon without Christ--what good would
   it do you? I would remind you that no blessing is a Covenant blessing,
   or a blessing at all, except as it is connected with Christ Jesus and
   so with the Lord God. No comfort is worth having if Jesus does not
   comfort us! No forgiveness is worth the words which utter it if Jesus
   does not forgive. There is no coming to the Father except by Christ.
   If, therefore, I imagine that I have come to the Father without Christ,
   it is clear that I have not come! If I fancy that I have saving
   blessings apart from the appointed Savior, I am a deceived man!
   Beloved, do not seek after mercy, pardon, holiness, Heaven--except
   through Christ Jesus our Lord--for you will be seeking counterfeits,
   shadows, delusions. Begin at the Cross! See how Jesus puts it--"Come
   unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest." He does not first say, "Take My yoke upon you," but first, "Come
   unto Me." He first gives us rest and then, afterwards, we find it. But
   we begin with coming to

   Him.

   First Christ and then His yoke. First Christ and then rest. Do not ask
   for rest, first, and then say, "I will come to Christ afterwards." This
   is an impossible order! Do not even say, "I must get a broken heart and
   then come to Christ." No, come to Christ FOR a broken heart! I preach a
   Savior to you, tonight, who wants nothing of you, but who is ready to
   begin with you at the beginning, just where you are, in all your
   unworthiness and ill desert--in all your depravity and vileness! He is
   ready to take you up from the mire of the pit wherein you lie and to
   look on you with love in all the pollution with which you are
   disgraced! Come, then, and begin with Jesus! It is the necessary order
   of your coming--first to Christ and then to His yoke and to His peace.
   Let your faith exercise itself, not so much on what you ought to be, or
   on what you hope to be, as on what Christ is and on His ability to make
   you all that your heart pines after. Hear the good word of my text and
   give good heed to it. Note well the permission of heavenly love--"Let
   Israel hope in the Lord."

   Observe, also, that, as it is the natural order and the necessary
   order, so it is evidently the easiest order. Sometimes it seems, to a
   burdened heart, to be more than difficult to believe in the pardon of
   innumerable sins--it appears impossible. Guilty One, do not try to
   believe in pardon in the abstract, but believe in Jesus the Sacrifice
   and Savior, who has once and for all appeared to put away sin. Believe
   in the Divine Substitute and then you will believe that the forgiveness
   of your sins is a thing provided for by Him. Do not even say, "I can
   never be sanctified. Such a wretched sinner as I am could never be made
   into a saint." Do not try to believe in sanctification, but rely upon
   the boundless power of Jesus to "make you perfect in every good work to
   do His will, working in you that which is well pleasing in His sight."
   For all parts of salvation, hope in the Lord and look to His hands for
   the working thereof. Forget yourself, now, and only think of Him who
   works all things according to the good pleasure of His will. Cease
   looking for the water and look for the Well! You will more readily see
   the Savior than see salvation, for He is lifted up, even He who is God,
   and beside Him there is none else. You will more easily fix your eyes
   on Jesus than upon justification, sanctification, or any other separate
   blessing. When the work seems hard, look to His hands--"Is anything too
   hard for the Lord?"

   You may fix your eyes upon a Covenant promise till it dazzles you, but
   if you see Jesus, the sight will strengthen your eyes and you will see
   the promise in Him--and perceive it to be, yes and amen, to the Glory
   of God. It is easier to believe in a personal Christ than in impersonal
   promises. That poor woman who was sick, in Jesus Christ's day, might
   have said to herself, "It is impossible that I should be healed," but
   then she thought not so much of the healing as of the Healer-- and when
   she saw Jesus walking about among the crowds, healing all manner of
   diseases--and when she believed that God was in Him, why, then she
   inferred that He could heal her disease! And so she came up behind Him
   and touched the hem of His garment. She sought Him and so sought
   healing! Stay in this line--let not the devil take you from it--that
   the first object of your faith should be the Lord Jesus, for by Him, as
   the Ladder which God has set up, you can climb to the highest place of
   privilege and lay hold upon the choicest gift of Divine Grace!

   This is the way to God, Himself, and the only way which our human feet
   can tread. Consider well who Christ was and what He has done--and then
   you will conclude that He can save even you! By looking to Him, you
   will be saved and what is easier than to look? To hope in God is a far
   more simple matter than to search for signs and evidences in yourself,
   or to labor to force yourself up into certain states of mind. Answer
   the question, "Will He save me?" by looking to see what kind of a
   Savior Jesus is--and when you perceive the Glory of His Person, the
   perfection of His obedience and the merit of His blood--you will be
   convinced that you may safely trust in Him according to His command,
   for He commands you to believe! Jesus declares, "Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out." Let us come at once, for it is the nearest
   and best road to peace!

   To come, first of all, to God in Christ Jesus is the wisest course. You
   are too bewildered to know which blessing to seek, therefore seek
   Jesus, Himself, and He will be unto you wisdom! It is easier to come to
   the Cross than to the separate blessings which come of it. Take the
   straight road which lies plainly before your face.

   In faintness and trembling of heart we dare not appropriate a
   mercy--our palsied hands cannot grasp a favor and, therefore, it is our
   wisdom to fall at Jesus' feet and let Him give us what seems good to
   Him. Through our ignorance, we know not what to ask for--and through
   our doubt we are afraid to ask--therefore, let us leave all with our
   Lord. We need the wine and oil, but we are sorely wounded and shall do
   well to lie still and let Him pour them in. When the Good Samaritan is
   come, all is come. Let us, therefore, neither cry for wine nor oil, but
   for HIM--we know His name! The wisdom of the prayer is seen in its
   completeness. At first, sinners, conscious of their ill desert, cry to
   be saved from Hell and this is the most of their prayer. But suppose
   the Lord should give them this and not change their natures--would they
   be one whit the better? If there were no fires of Tophet, so long as a
   man has sin within him, he creates his own Hell! In seeking the Lord
   Jesus, a man finds escape from punishment and much more. No man knows
   enough to be able to ask for an all-round salvation--he will only seek
   this or that which seems to him most pressingly necessary. We are too
   ignorant, too much the creatures of feeling, too partial, too childish
   to make a catalog of what we need. But we can ask for Jesus, and He is
   all in one! How excellent is that hymn of ours with the refrain--

   "Give me Christ, or else I die!"

   We have asked all when we have asked for the Savior anointed of the
   Lord. When our hope is in God through the Mediator whom He has
   appointed, we hope in Him in a way which renders our hope sure and
   steadfast--and this is the highest wisdom. In laying hold upon Jesus
   you have obtained not only something, but everything. In looking first
   to

   Jesus, you have sought for the Kingdom of God and His righteousness,
   and you know the promise that all other things shall be added. If you
   need strength, comfort, guidance, fruitfulness and anything else that
   makes up eternal salvation, behold, you have it in your Lord! Nothing
   that is needed for a soul between this present state of trial and the
   perfection of Heaven is omitted from Christ--"you are complete in Him."
   If, therefore, you make Him the first object of your faith, and lay
   hold upon Him, rather than upon any or all blessings, you are delivered
   from anxiety as to whether your ignorant prayers have comprehended all
   you need--and this is be a wise course to follow.

   It is, therefore, the most profitable course for needy souls like
   ourselves. By grasping our Lord and hoping in Him, we fill our hands,
   not with brass or silver, but with gold of Ophir. Let others hope where
   they may, but let Israel, the Prince, hope in the Lord from whom he has
   already won such royal favors. I see at times, in the newspaper,
   "Principals only will be dealt with," and in our heavenly business we
   had better keep to this rule. Go not to the servants--make all your
   applications to the Master--and in your dealings with Him seek not so
   much His gifts as Himself, for the Giver is always greater than what He
   gives! The bottle of water which Hagar carried for Ishmael is a poor
   thing compared with that well of God beside which Isaac abode. Fruit
   from a choice tree is well, but apples of gold in baskets of silver are
   not to be despised. But, if one can have the tree planted in his own
   garden, he is far richer. Our Lord is the apple tree among the trees of
   the forest and, to possess HIM, is to have the best of the best, yes,
   all things that can be desired! Covenant blessings are streams, but our
   Lord Jesus is the Wellhead. Believe for the infinite, immutable,
   inexhaustible "deep which lies under," and you may sink as many wells
   as you please.

   I believe that in every case wherein the soul finds peace, this is the
   actual order. We may go about after pardon, renewal and holiness, but
   we find no rest unto our souls while hunting for these. As a matter of
   fact, we look unto HIM and are lightened--and not by any other means.
   If, by aiming even at repentance, we are taken off from the Lord--we
   are taken off the right road. It is possible even to look to faith in
   such a manner as to forget the Object of faith! It is not my hand, but
   what my hand grasps that saves me when I lay hold on Christ! It is not
   my eye, but what my eyes see which saves me when I look to Jesus! In
   very deed no heart can find salvation in that which comes forth from
   itself--its hope lies only in the Lord, alone, to whom it must trust
   for everything. Beware of trusting to an anchor which lies on your own
   deck, or to a confidence which depends in the least degree on yourself.
   "Let Israel hope in the Lord." Now the Lord is not self, nor will He be
   joined with self! The Lord is beyond and outside of all that the
   creation can find within, or hope to produce from itself. Mercy and
   redemption are with the Lord, not with self. Why, then, should we look
   where, in the very nature of things, those are not and cannot be? Why
   not look to the Lord, in whom, alone, all heavenly treasures abide?

   This, then, is my message to every man or woman who desires salvation,
   "Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and
   with Him is plenteous redemption." Do not begin by hoping in mercy and
   redemption, for these are not to be found apart from the Lord--but go
   at once to that Divine Person with whom there is mercy and plenteous
   redemption--then both of those will be granted to you. I wish I knew
   how to put this so plainly that every bewildered and cast-down spirit
   would catch my meaning and accept its counsel. I would also have
   preachers learn a lesson from the point I have been driving at. Let
   them not so much preach sinners to Christ as preach Christ to sinners.
   I am persuaded that a full and clear declaration of what Jesus is, as
   to His Person, offices, Character, work and authority would do more to
   produce faith than all our exhortations. "Whoever believes in Him has
   everlasting life"--but how shall they believe unless they hear of Him?

   The very best topic for the immediate conversion of men is Christ
   Crucified--the doctrine that God was in Christ reconciling the world
   unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. I know one that
   came in here full of evil, living an unchaste life--and the text was,
   "He that believes in Him has everlasting life." There would not seem to
   be anything about the sermon to convict of sin but the charming mercy
   of God won that heart, and that heart, being won by love, learned at
   once to hate evil and to serve the Lord Jesus in all that is pure,
   lovely and of good report! There sat in this very house, not long ago,
   side by side with one who is still in the service of Satan, a woman who
   had not attended the House of God for years. Nothing was heard but the
   simple proclamation of the Grace of God in Christ Jesus to the
   guilty--and she was shot down by the side of her companion--the thought
   of the amazing mercy and infinite love of God, in giving His Son to
   die, touched her heart and she began to weep. Immediately her companion
   upbraided her, but she answered, "I have found mercy." That was enough
   for her--she made no other excuse for her emotion.

   I pray that the same effects may follow this sermon. I bid you hope in
   the Lord! Look not to abstract mercy! Look not to any feelings or
   resolves in yourselves! Look not, even, to the hearing of the Word of
   God, or to promises, alone, but look to Jesus, who still lives, and who
   is in the midst of His people at this time, waiting to receive all who
   are willing to come to Him! While I tell you this, I am praying the
   Holy Spirit to bless the Word to your souls, so that, at once, without
   delay, you may look only to the Lord and may trust in Him and be saved!
   You are allowed to do so, for the text says, "Let Israel hope in the
   Lord." If the Scripture permits, who shall forbid?

   II. Another form of the same Truth of God now invites our
   attention--ALL EXERCISES OF FAITH IN REFERENCE TO OTHER THINGS MUST BE
   IN CONNECTION WITH THE LORD. I began with our first exercise of faith,

   but I would not end there. As the stars called, "the Pointers," always
   point to the polestar, so must our faith always look to God in Christ
   Jesus. Having begun with Jesus, our faith must not look elsewhere. Let
   Israel always hope in the Lord, for with Him is what she still
   requires. What do you need tonight, dear Friend? Ask, and you shall
   receive--but ask only of the Lord! Knock, but knock at the same door!
   Plead, but when you are pleading, still plead the name of Jesus!
   Whenever you are expecting a heavenly favor, expect it from the Father
   through His dear Son, by the Holy Spirit! Whenever you are longing,
   long for nothing more than there is in Christ! And whenever you obtain
   a mercy, remember that you have received it only because you have, by
   faith, received Jesus, and so have become a child of God. Whenever you
   rejoice in a mercy, take care that you do not so much glory in it as in
   the Lord from whom it came. Hope in the Lord and never have any hope in
   yourself, for that would be a fruitless, groundless, rootless, sapless
   hope! You are still to find mercy and plenteous redemption in the Lord
   alone.

   I am afraid that sometimes we seek mercies apart from God the Giver, or
   apart from Christ, the channel of their bestowal--and this is always
   ill of us. Avoid such dangerous error! I read in the papers,
   frequently, allusions to "Providence." I know what I mean by
   Providence, but I do not know what the newspapers mean by it. I fear it
   is only a convenient phrase, a conventional expression which is not to
   be too carefully examined. They do not mean a living, foreseeing,
   providing, working Personality--that would be too much like religion!
   They admit a certain something, "a power which makes for
   righteousness," a nonentity called, "Providence." I have too often
   heard Christian people talk about thanking Providence. What is that? Do
   you mean, "thank God"? If so, say it boldly! It is God that provides.
   God arranges, God overrules, God works out His gracious designs! Again,
   how often do we hear of, "Nature" doing this and, "Nature" being that
   and, "Nature" producing the other! What do you mean? An infidel, some
   time ago, was speaking in the open air and he orated very eloquently
   about the elevating influences of Nature and what a blessing it was to
   study Nature. A friend in the crowd said to him, "That is very pretty,
   but would you have the goodness to tell me what Nature is, which does
   all this?" The orator answered tartly, "Every fool knows what Nature
   is." "Well," said the questioner, "then it will be easy to tell us."
   "Nature," said the speaker, "Well, Nature is Nature."

   Just so. That is where it ended. And so it is with very many people
   when they talk about Providence or Nature. Let us not speak without
   knowing what we mean, or without declaring our meaning. We do not erect
   an altar and inscribe it TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. We know the Lord and are
   known of Him and, therefore, we should speak of Him as our hope, our
   trust, our joy! We know no Providence apart from Jehovah-Jireh, the God
   who foresees and provides! To us there is no fickle chance, but the
   Lord reigns. Equally to us is there no blind, inexorable fate, but the
   Most High decrees and works out His wise and sovereign will! Therefore
   do not let God's Israel talk as if they hoped in luck or fate, but let
   them, "hope in the Lord," and acknowledge their reliance upon a
   personal God who is always working for them--"for with Him is mercy,
   and with Him is plenteous redemption."

   Now, dear Brothers and Sisters, do you need mercy? In your prayers for
   pardoning mercy, quote the Savior's Sacrifice. Do you need sparing
   mercy? Mention Him whom God did not spare in the great atoning day. Do
   you need restoring mercy? Plead Him whom God brought again from the
   dead! Do you need to behold the light of Jehovah's Countenance? Plead
   Him who said, "Why have You forsaken Me?" In hoping for mercy, set the
   eyes of your hope upon the Lord Jesus and let no mercy be hoped for by
   you apart from Him! Remember what happened to Uzziah. He was a man of
   God and a king--but when he had grown very great, he thought that he
   would act as priest for himself. He went into the sanctuary of the Lord
   and burned incense on his own account--without the Lord's appointed
   priest--and he was struck with leprosy! And not only was he thrust out
   of the Temple, but he, himself, hurried to get out!

   I tremble for those in whom I see any sign of going before God in right
   of their own character. I fear that among God's own professing people
   there are some who are so conscious of their own knowledge and growth,
   that they pray without Christ, praise without Christ, and talk of being
   no longer in need of confessing sin! They dare to act without humbly
   depending upon the Presence of the great High Priest--and then they
   fall into sin and thus they are struck with leprosy and, perhaps, to
   their dying day they can never enter into such fellowship with God as
   once they knew. I would do nothing without Jesus! I would not even wish
   to repent except my eyes were upon the Cross. I would not hope to think
   a holy thought except as my soul still gazed upon Jesus my All. Away,
   away with every idea of mercy except it is mercy received through
   Jesus, for He, alone, is full of Grace and of His fullness must we
   receive! I would bind you, Brothers and Sisters, if I could, to the
   Cross as your one hope! I pray the Lord bind me forever to the
   Cross--the wounds my only fountains of hope, the blood and water my
   only cleansing! Go, you who have a righteousness of your own, and hope
   elsewhere! The only hope of my soul is the bleeding, dying, buried,
   risen, coming Savior! "Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord
   there is mercy," and with Him, alone! All the exercises of faith about
   mercy must always be tethered to the Cross. Mercy flows through Christ
   alone.

   So is it with "plenteous redemption." What a grand utterance that
   is--"plenteous redemption!" I would like to dwell upon it. Is there not
   rare music in the sound? It means plenteous forgiveness for plenteous
   sin, through a price paid, a ransom given. Only in Christ can you find
   this! "With Him is plenteous redemption." Do not dream of finding
   redemption in ordinances, in prayers, in tears, or in anything but the
   life and death and Person of the Son of God! "With Him is plenteous
   redemption." He has paid a great price and, therefore, a great debt is
   blotted out! Great offenses are forgiven, but only through the precious
   blood of our adorable Redeemer.

   "Plenteous redemption." Why, that means deliverance from the bondage of
   many lusts, freedom from the thralldom of strong passions, a ransom of
   captives from fierce taskmasters! My God, I long to be so delivered and
   redeemed! And there is with You all Grace, power and provision for
   plenteous deliverance by redemption--but this is found in Christ alone.
   I charge you, my Hearers, do not look for escape from the slavery of
   sin apart from the redemption of Christ! Do not expect to overcome the
   smallest sin except by the blood of the Lamb! There is nothing, I
   believe, more deceiving than the notion of the unregenerate heart that
   it is seeking after holiness--though it is destitute of the power of
   the Holy Spirit and takes no thought of the merit of Jesus Christ. We
   need much grace and plenteous redemption in fact--but all of all that
   we receive must come to us from the Lord, by Jesus Christ the Mediator!

   "Plenteous redemption" includes in its range of meaning great growth in
   Divine Grace, abounding usefulness, high spirituality and perfect
   preparedness for Heaven. For all these we must hope in the Lord, for
   they are with Him. Never think to have redemption in the least or in
   the highest degree apart from your hope in the Lord--your trusting in
   Christ Jesus.

   The pith and marrow of what I have said is this--hope distinctly in the
   Lord. There are many stars, but let one, alone, of all the train be the
   Object of your believing eye. Lay the foundation of your hope in the
   Lord! Go on building up your comfort in the Lord Jesus and in Him bring
   forth the top stone. Begin with Christ and end with Christ! As Christ
   grows more to you, take care that self grows less and less. If your
   Christianity puffs you up, it is not Christ's Christianity. I spoke
   just now of King Uzziah, let me refer to him once more. Read in the
   Second of Chronicles, chapter 26, at the 15th verse--"He was
   marvelously helped, till he was strong." When he became strong, he went
   off the lines and we read, "When he was strong, his heart was lifted up
   to his destruction." Mind that. God will always help us while we are
   weak. When we are strong--what shall I say? Then are we weak and have
   need to fear, for we are already being lifted up, or we should not
   count ourselves strong--poor, puny creatures that we are! God will
   always bless us as long as we confess our dependence upon His blessing.
   He will always fill us as long as we are empty! He will always feed us
   as long as we are hungry. He will be your All in All so long as you are
   nothing.

   But the moment you boast in yourself, and say, "I am rich, and
   increased in goods, and have need of nothing," you will be left to
   learn that you are naked, poor and miserable! Woe was the day in which
   dust and ashes set up somebody! Nebuchadnezzar is proud and soon finds
   a rapid descent from the throne to eating grass like cattle! Worms, in
   the Presence of the Lord, do all they may do when they hope--they do
   all they can do when they hope in Him! They have nothing but sin and He
   has mercy upon them. They are slaves to evil, but He has plenteous
   redemption with which to set them free. The poorest, weakest, saddest
   among us may hope in the Lord, for He can do all things! Therefore, let
   us end our

   meeting with each one of us hoping in the Lord--and let us continue in
   our faith in "the God of hope"--till we receive the Heaven we hope for
   through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Covenant Promise of the Spirit

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 10, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And I will put My Spirit within you." Ezekiel 36:27.

   No preface is needed and the largeness of our subject forbids our
   wasting time in beating about the bush. I shall try to do two things
   this morning--first, I would commend the text. And, secondly, I would,
   in some measure, expound the text.

   I. First, as for THE COMMENDATION OF THE TEXT, the tongues of men and
   of angels might fail. To call it a golden sentence would be much too
   commonplace--to liken it to a pearl of great price would be too poor a
   comparison! We cannot feel, much less speak, too much in praise of that
   great God who has put this clause into the Covenant of His Grace. In
   that Covenant, every sentence is more precious than Heaven and
   earth--and this line is not the least among His choice words of
   promise--"I will put My Spirit within you."

   I would begin by saying that it is a gracious Word. It was spoken to a
   graceless people, to a people who had followed "their own way" and
   refused the way of God--a people who had already provoked something
   more than ordinary anger in the Judge of all the earth, for He,
   Himself, said (v 18), "I poured My fury upon them." These people, even
   under chastisement, caused the holy name of God to be profaned among
   the heathen wherever they went! They had been highly favored, but they
   abused their privileges and behaved worse than those who never knew the
   Lord. They sinned wantonly, willfully, wickedly, proudly and
   presumptuously and, by this, they greatly provoked the Lord. Yet to
   them He made such a promise as this--"I will put My Spirit within you."
   Surely, where sin abounded Divine Grace did much more abound!

   Clearly this is a Word of Grace, for the Law says nothing of this kind.
   Turn to the Law of Moses and see if there is any Word of God spoken
   therein concerning the putting of the Spirit within men to cause them
   to walk in God's statutes. The Law proclaims the statutes, but only the
   Gospel promises the Spirit by which the statutes will be obeyed. The
   Law commands and makes us know what God requires of us, but the Gospel
   goes further and inclines us to obey the will of the Lord and enables
   us, practically, to walk in His ways. Under the dominion of Grace the
   Lord works in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure!

   So great a gift as this could never come to any man by merit. A man
   might so act as to deserve a reward of a certain kind, in measure
   suited to his commendable action, but the Holy Spirit can never be the
   wage of human service--the idea verges upon blasphemy! Can any man
   deserve that Christ should die for him? Who would dream of such a
   thing? Can any man deserve that the Holy Spirit should dwell in him and
   work holiness in him? The greatness of the blessing lifts it high above
   the range of merit and we see that if the Holy Spirit is bestowed, it
   must be by an act of Divine Grace--Grace infinite in bounty, exceeding
   all that we could have imagined. "Sovereign Grace over sin abounding"
   is here seen in clearest light. "I will put My Spirit within you" is a
   promise which drops with Graces as the honeycomb with honey! Listen to
   the Divine music which pours from this Word of Love. I hear the soft
   melody of Grace, Grace, Grace and nothing else but Grace. Glory be to
   God, who gives to sinners the indwelling of His Spirit!

   Note, next, that it is a Divine Word-- "I will put My Spirit within
   you." Who but the Lord could speak after this fashion? Can one man put
   the Spirit of God within another? Could all the Church combined breathe
   the Spirit of God into a single sinner's heart? To put any good thing
   into the deceitful heart of man is a great achievement, but to put the
   Spirit of God into the heart, truly, this is the finger of God! No,
   here I may say, the Lord has made bare His arm and displayed the
   fullness of His mighty power! To put the Spirit of God into our nature
   is a work peculiar to the Godhead and

   to do this within the nature of a free agent, such as man, is
   marvelous! Who but Jehovah, the God of Israel, can speak after this
   royal style and, beyond all dispute, declare, "I will put My Spirit
   within you"?

   Men must always surround their resolves with conditions and
   uncertainties, but since Omnipotence is at the back of every promise of
   God, He speaks like a king, yes, in a style which is only fit for the
   eternal God! He purposes and promises and He as surely performs. Sure,
   then, is this sacred saying, "I will put My Spirit within you." Sure,
   because Divine! O Sinner, if we poor creatures had the saving of you,
   we should break down in the attempt, but, behold, the Lord, Himself,
   comes on the scene and the work is done! All difficulties are removed
   by this one sentence, "I will put My Spirit within you." We have worked
   with our spirit, we have wept over you and we have entreated you--but
   we have failed. Lo, there comes One into the matter who will not fail,
   with whom nothing is impossible! And He begins His work by saying, "I
   will put My Spirit within you." The Word is of Grace and of God--regard
   it, then, as a pledge from the God of Grace.

   To me there is much charm in further thought that this is an individual
   and personal Word of God. The Lord means, "I will put My Spirit within
   you." That is to say, within you, as individuals. "I will put My Spirit
   within you" one by one. This must be so, since connection requires it.
   We read in verse 26, "A new heart also will I give you." Now, a new
   heart can only be given to one person. Each man needs a heart of his
   own and each man must have a new heart for himself. "And a new spirit
   will I put within you." Within each one this must be done. "And I will
   take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an
   heart of flesh"--these are all personal, individual operations of
   Divine Grace! God deals with men one by one in solemn matters of
   eternity, sin and salvation. We are born one by one and we die one by
   one--even so we must be born again one by one--and each one, for
   himself, must receive Spirit of God. Without this, a man has nothing!
   He cannot be caused to walk in God's statutes except by infusion of
   Grace into him as an individual.

   I think I see among my hearers one man, or woman, who feels himself, or
   herself, to be all alone in the world and, therefore, hopeless. You can
   believe that God will do great things for a nation, but how shall
   solitary be thought of? You are an odd person, one that could not be
   written down in any list--a peculiar sinner with constitutional
   tendencies all your own. Thus says God, "I will put My Spirit within
   you"--within your heart--even yours! My dear Hearers, you who have long
   been seeking salvation, but have not known the power of the
   Spirit--this is what you need! You have been striving in energy of
   flesh, but you have not understood where your true strength lies. God
   says to you, "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the
   Lord." And again, "I will put My Spirit within you." Oh, that this Word
   might be spoken of the Lord to that young man who is ready to despair!
   To that sorrowful woman who has been looking into herself for power to
   pray and believe! You are without strength or hope in and of yourself,
   but this meets your case in all points. "I will put My Spirit within
   you"--within you as an individual! Enquire of the Lord for it! Lift up
   your heart in prayer to God and ask Him to pour upon you the Spirit of
   Grace and of supplications. Plead with the Lord, saying, "Let Your good
   Spirit lead me. Even me!" Cry, "Pass me not, my gracious Father; but in
   me fulfill this wondrous Word of yours, 'I will put My Spirit within
   you.'"

   Note, next, that this is a separating word. I do not know whether you
   will see this readily, but it must be so--this Word of God separates a
   man from his fellows. Men by nature are of another spirit from that of
   God and are under subjection to that evil spirit, the Prince of the
   power of the air. When the Lord comes to gather out His own, fetching
   out from among the heathen, He effects separation by doing according to
   this Word, "I will put My Spirit within you." This done, the individual
   becomes a new man. Those who have the Spirit are not of the world, nor
   like the world--and soon have to come out from among the ungodly and to
   be separate--for difference of nature creates conflict. God's Spirit
   will not dwell with the evil spirit--you cannot have fellowship with
   Christ and with Belial--with the Kingdom of Heaven and with this world.

   I wish that the people of God would again wake up to the Truth of God
   that to gather out a people from among men is the great purpose of the
   present dispensation. It is still true, as James said at the Jerusalem
   Council, "Simeon has declared how God at first did visit the Gentiles,
   to take out of them a people for His name." We are not to remain
   clinging to the old wreck with expectation that we shall pump water out
   of her and get her safe into port. No, the cry is very different--"Take
   to the lifeboat! Take to the lifeboat!" You are to quit the wreck and
   then you are to carry away from the sinking mass, that which God will
   save. You must be separate from the old wreck, lest it suck you down to
   sure destruc-

   tion! Your only hope of doing good to the world is by yourselves being,
   "not of the world," even as Christ was not of the world.

   For you to go down to the world's level will neither be good for it nor
   for you. That which happened in the days of Noah will be repeated, for
   when the sons of God entered into alliance with the daughters of
   men--and there was a league between the two races--the Lord could not
   endure the evil mixture, but drew up the sluices of the lower deep and
   swept the earth with a destroying flood. Surely, in that last day of
   destruction, when the world is overwhelmed with fire, it will be
   because the Church of God shall have degenerated and the distinctions
   between the righteous and the wicked shall have been broken down. The
   Spirit of God, wherever He comes, does speedily make and reveal the
   difference between Israel and Egypt--and in proportion as His active
   energy is felt, there will be an ever-widening gulf between those who
   are led of the Spirit and those who are under the dominion of the
   flesh.

   The possession of the Spirit will make you, my Hearer, quite another
   sort of man from what you are now, and then you will be actuated by
   motives which the world will not appreciate, for the world knows us not
   because it knew Him not. Then you will act, speak, think and feel in
   such a way that this evil world will misunderstand and condemn you.
   Since the carnal mind knows not the things that are of God--for those
   things are spiritually discerned--it will not approve your objectives
   and designs. Do not expect it to be your friend. The Spirit which makes
   you to be of the seed of the woman is not the spirit of the world! The
   seed of the serpent will hiss at you and bruise your heel. Your Master
   said, "Because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of
   the world; therefore the world hates you." This is a separating Word of
   God, this. Has it separated you? Has the Holy Spirit called you alone
   and blessed you? Do you differ from your old companions? Have you a
   life they do not understand? If not, may God in mercy put into you that
   most heavenly deposit, of which He speaks in our text--"I will put My
   Spirit within you"!

   But now notice, that it is a very uniting Word. It separates from the
   world, but it joins to God. Note how it runs-- "I will put My Spirit
   within you." It is not merely a spirit, or the spirit, but My Spirit.
   Now when God's own Spirit comes to reside within our mortal bodies, how
   near akin we are to the Most High! "Know you not that your body is the
   Temple of the Holy Spirit?" Does not this make a man sublime? Have you
   never stood in awe of your own selves, O you Believers? Have you
   regarded enough even this poor body as being sanctified and dedicated,
   and elevated into a sacred condition, by being set apart to be the
   Temple of the Holy Spirit? Thus are we brought into the closest union
   with God that we can well conceive of. Thus is the Lord our Light and
   our life, while our spirit is subordinated to the Divine Spirit. "I
   will put My Spirit within you"--then God Himself dwells in you! The
   Spirit of Him that raised up Christ from the dead is in you! With
   Christ in God your life is hid and the Spirit seals you, anoints you
   and abides in you. By the Spirit we have access to the Father! By the
   Spirit we perceive our adoption and learn to cry, "Abba, Father." By
   the Spirit we are made partakers of the Divine Nature and have
   communion with the thrice holy Lord!

   I cannot help adding here that it is a very condescending Word--"I will
   put My Spirit within you." Is it really so, that the Spirit of God who
   displays the power and energetic force of God, by whom God's Word is
   carried into effect-- that the Spirit who of old moved upon the face of
   the waters and brought order and life from chaos and death--can it be
   so that He will deign to sojourn in men? God in our nature is a very
   wonderful conception! God in the Babe at Bethlehem, God in the
   Carpenter of Nazareth, God in the "Man of Sorrows," God in the
   Crucified, God in Him who was buried in the tomb--this is all
   marvelous! The Incarnation is an infinite mystery of love--but we
   believe it. Yet, if it were possible to compare one illimitable wonder
   with another, I should say that God's dwelling in His people--and that
   repeated ten thousand times over--is more marvelous!

   That the Holy Spirit should dwell in millions of redeemed men and women
   is a miracle not surpassed by that of our Lord's espousal of human
   nature, for our Lord's body was perfectly pure and the Godhead, while
   it dwells with His holy Manhood, does at least dwell with a perfect and
   sinless Nature. But the Holy Spirit bows Himself to dwell in sinful
   men! To dwell in men who, after their conversion, still find the flesh
   warring against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh--men who
   are not perfect, though they strive to be so--men who have to lament
   their shortcomings and even to confess with shame a measure of
   unbelief! "I will put My Spirit within you" means the abiding of the
   Holy Spirit in our imperfect nature. Wonder of wonders! Yet is it as
   surely a fact as it is a wonder. Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   you have the Spirit of God, for, "if any man has not the Spirit of
   Christ, He is none of His."

   You could not bear the suspicion that you are not His and, therefore,
   as surely as you are Christ's, you have His Spirit abiding in you! The
   Savior has gone away on purpose that the Comforter might be given to
   dwell in you--and He does dwell in you. Is it not so? If it is so,
   admire this condescending God, and worship and praise His name! Sweetly
   submit to His rule in all things. Grieve not the Spirit of God. Watch
   carefully that nothing comes within you that may defile the Temple of
   God. Let the faintest monition of the Holy Spirit be law to you. It was
   a holy mystery that the Presence of the Lord was specially within the
   veil of the Tabernacle and that the Lord God spoke by Urim and Thummim
   to His people. It is an equally sacred marvel that now the Holy Spirit
   dwells in our spirits and abides within our nature and speaks to us
   whatever He hears of the Father. By Divine impressions which the opened
   ear can apprehend and the tender heart can receive, He speaks to us.
   God grant us to know His still small voice so as to listen to it with
   reverent humility and loving joy--then shall we know the meaning of
   these words, "I will put My Spirit within you."

   Nor have I yet done with commending my text, for I must not fail to
   remind you that it is a very spiritual Word. "I will put My Spirit
   within you" has nothing to do with our wearing a peculiar garb--that
   would be a matter of little worth. It has nothing to do with
   affectations of speech--those might readily become a deceptive
   peculiarity. Our text has nothing to do with outward rites and
   ceremonies, but goes much further and deeper. It is an instructive
   symbol when the Lord teaches us our death with Christ by burial in
   Baptism--it is to our great profit that He ordains bread and wine to be
   tokens of our communion in the body and blood of His dear Son--but
   these are only outward things and if they are unattended with the Holy
   Spirit they fail of their design.

   There is something infinitely greater in this promise--"I will put My
   Spirit within you." I cannot give you the whole force of the Hebrew, as
   to the words, "within you," unless I paraphrase them a little, and
   read, "I will put My Spirit in the midst of you." The sacred deposit is
   put deep down in our life's secret place. God puts His Spirit not upon
   the surface of the man, but into the center of his being. The promise
   means--"I will put My Spirit in your heart, in the very soul of you."
   This is an intensely spiritual matter, without admixture of anything
   material and visible. It is spiritual, you see, because it is the
   Spirit that is given--and He is given internally within our spirit. It
   is true the Spirit operates upon the external life, but it is through
   the secret and internal life, and of that inward operation our text
   speaks.

   This is what we so greatly require. Do you know what it is to attend a
   service and hear God's Truth faithfully preached and yet you are forced
   to say, "Somehow or other it did not enter into me; I did not feel the
   unction and taste the savor of it"? "I will put My Spirit within you,"
   is what you need. Do you not read your Bibles and even pray--and do not
   both devotional exercises become too much eternal acts? "I will put My
   Spirit within you" meets this evil! The good Spirit fires your heart.
   He penetrates your mind. He saturates your soul. He touches the secret
   and vital springs of your existence. Blessed Word of God! I love my
   text. I love it better than I can speak of it!

   Observe once more that this Word is a very effectual one. "I will put
   My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you
   shall keep My judgments and do them." The Spirit is operative--first
   upon the inner life in causing you to love the Law of the Lord--and
   then it moves you openly to keep His statutes concerning Himself and
   His judgments between you and your fellow men. Obedience, if a man
   should be flogged to it, would be of little worth. But obedience
   springing out of a life within--this is a priceless breastplate of
   jewels. If you have a lantern, you cannot make it shine by polishing
   the outside glass, you must put a candle in it--and this is what God
   does--He puts the light of the Spirit within us and then our light
   shines! He puts His Spirit so deep down into the heart that the whole
   nature feels it! It works upward, like a spring from the bottom of a
   well. It is, moreover, so deeply implanted that there is no removing
   it. If it were in the memory, you might forget it. If it were in the
   intellect, you might err in it. But, "within you," it touches the whole
   man and has dominion over you without fear of failure. When the very
   kernel of your nature is quickened into holiness, practical godliness
   is effectually secured. Blessed is He who knows by experience our
   Lord's Words--"The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well
   of water springing up into everlasting life."

   If I should fail in expounding the text, I hope I have so fully
   commended it to you that you will turn it over and meditate upon it
   yourselves--and so get a home-born exposition of it! The key of the
   text is within its own self, for if the Lord gives you the Spirit, you
   will then understand His Words--"I will put My Spirit within you."

   II. But now I must work upon THE EXPOSITION OF THE TEXT. I trust the
   Holy Spirit will aid me. Let me show

   you how the good Spirit manifests the fact that He dwells in men. I
   have to be very brief on a theme that might require a great length of
   time and can only mention a part of His ways and workings.

   One of the first effects of the Spirit of God being put within us is
   quickening. We are dead by nature to all heavenly and spiritual things,
   but when the Spirit of God comes, then we begin to live. The man
   visited of the Spirit begins to feel--the terrors of God make him
   tremble, the love of Christ makes him weep. He begins to fear and he
   begins to hope--a great deal of the first and a very little of the
   second, it may be. He learns spiritually to sorrow. He is grieved that
   he has sinned and that he cannot cease from sinning. He begins to
   desire that which once he despised--he especially desires to find the
   way of pardon and reconciliation with God. Ah, dear Hearers! I cannot
   make you feel, I cannot make you sorrow for sin, I cannot make you
   desire eternal life--but it is all done as soon as this is fulfilled by
   the Lord, "I will put My Spirit within you." The quickening Spirit
   brings life to the dead in trespasses and sins!

   This life of the Spirit shows itself by causing the man to pray. The
   cry is the distinctive mark of the living child. He begins to cry in
   broken accents, "God be merciful to me." At the same time that he
   pleads, he feels the soft tug of repentance. He has a new mind towards
   sin and he grieves that he should have grieved his God. With this comes
   faith, perhaps feeble and trembling--only a touch of the hem of the
   Savior's robe--but still Jesus is his only hope and his sole trust. To
   Him he looks for pardon and salvation. He dares to believe that Christ
   can save even him. Then has life come into the soul when trust in Jesus
   springs up in the heart!

   Remember, dear Friends, that as the Holy Spirit gives quickening at the
   first, so He must revive and strengthen it. Whenever you become dull
   and faint, cry for the Holy Spirit. Whenever you cannot feel in
   devotion as you wish to feel and are unable to rise to any heights of
   communion with God, plead my text in faith and beg the Lord to do as He
   has said, namely, "I will put My Spirit within you." Go to God with
   this Covenant clause, even if you have to confess, "Lord, I am like a
   log. I am a helpless lump of weakness. Unless You come and quicken me I
   cannot live to You." Plead importunately the promise, "I will put My
   Spirit within you." All the life of the flesh will gender corruption.
   All the energy that comes of mere excitement will die down into the
   black ashes of disappointment. Only the Holy Spirit is the life of the
   regenerated heart! Have you the Spirit? And if you have Him within you,
   have you only a small measure of His life, and do you wish for more?
   Then go where you went at first! There is only one river of the Water
   of Life--draw from its floods. You will be lively enough, bright
   enough, strong enough and happy enough when the Holy Spirit is mighty
   within your soul!

   When the Holy Spirit enters, after quickening he gives enlightening. We
   cannot make men see the Truth of God-- they are blind--but when the
   Lord puts His Spirit within them, their eyes are opened. At first they
   may see rather hazily, but still they see. As the light increases and
   the eye is strengthened, they see more and more clearly. What a mercy
   it is to see Christ, to look unto Him and so to be lightened! By the
   Spirit, souls see things in their reality--they see the actual truth of
   them and perceive that they are facts. The Spirit of God illuminates
   every Believer so that he sees still more marvelous things out of God's
   Law--but this never happens unless the Spirit opens his eyes. The
   Apostle speaks of being brought "out of darkness into His marvelous
   light" and it is a marvelous light, indeed, to come to the blind and
   dead! Marvelous because it reveals the Truth of God with clearness. It
   reveals marvelous things in a marvelous way! If hills and mountains, if
   rocks and stones were suddenly to be full of eyes, it would be a
   strange thing in the earth, but not more marvelous than for you and for
   me by the illumination of the Holy Spirit to see spiritual things!

   When you cannot make people see the Truth of God, do not grow angry
   with them, but cry, "Lord, put Your Spirit within them!" When you get
   into a puzzle over the Word of the Lord, do not give up in despair, but
   believingly cry, "Lord, put Your Spirit within me!" Here lies the only
   true light of the soul. Depend upon it, all that you see by any light
   except the Spirit of God, you do not see spiritually. If you only see
   intellectually, or rationally, you do not see to salvation. Unless
   intellect and reason have received the heavenly Light of God, you may
   see, and yet not see--even as Israel of old. Indeed, your boasted clear
   sight may aggravate your ruin, like that of the Pharisees, of whom our
   Lord said, "But now you say, 'We see,' therefore your sin remains." O
   Lord, grant us the Spirit within, for our soul's illumination!

   The Spirit also works conviction. Conviction is more forcible than
   illumination. It is the setting of a Truth before the eye of the soul,
   so as to make it powerful upon the conscience. I speak to many here who
   know what conviction means. Still, I will explain it from my own
   experience. I knew what sin meant by my reading, but yet I never knew
   sin in its hei-nousness and horror till I found myself bitten by it as
   by a fiery serpent, and felt its poison boiling in my veins! When the
   Holy Spirit made sin to appear sin, then was I overwhelmed with the
   sight and I would gladly have fled from myself to escape the
   intolerable vision. A naked sin stripped of all excuse and set in the
   light of the Truth of God is a worse sight

   than to see the devil himself! When I saw sin as an offense against a
   just and holy God, committed by such a proud and yet insignificant
   creature as myself, then was I alarmed.

   Sirs, did you ever see and feel yourselves to be sinners? "Oh, yes,"
   you say, "we are sinners." O Sirs, do you mean it? Do you know what it
   means? Many of you are no more sinners in your own estimation than you
   are Hottentots. The beggar who exhibits a sham sore knows not
   disease--if he did, he would have enough of it without pretences. To
   kneel down and say, "Lord, have mercy upon us miserable sinners," and
   then to get up and feel yourself a very decent sort of person, worthy
   of commendation, is to mock Almighty God! It is by no means a common
   thing to get hold of a real sinner, one who is truly so in his own
   esteem. But it is as pleasant as it is rare, for you can bring to the
   real sinner the real Savior, and Jesus will welcome him! I do not
   wonder that Hart said--

   "A sinner is a saved thing, The Holy Spirit has made him so." The point
   of contact between a sinner and Christ is sin. The Lord Jesus gave
   Himself for our sins. He never gave Himself for our righteousnesses. He
   comes to heal the sick and the point He looks to is our sickness. When
   a physician is called in, he has no patience with things apart from his
   calling. "Tut, tut!" he cries, "I do not care about your furniture, nor
   the number of your cows, nor what income tax you pay, nor what politics
   you admire! I have come to see a sick man about his disease and if you
   will not let me deal with it I will be gone."

   When a sinner's corruptions are loathsome to himself. When his guilt is
   foul in his own nostrils. When he fears the death that will come of it,
   then it is that he is really convicted by the Holy Spirit--and no one
   ever knows sin as his own personal ruin till the Holy Spirit shows it
   to him! Conviction as to the Lord Jesus comes in the same way. We do
   not know Christ as our Savior till the Holy Spirit is put within us.
   Our Lord says--"He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you."
   And you never see the things of the Lord Jesus till the Holy Spirit
   shows them to you. To know Jesus Christ as your Savior, as one who died
   for you in particular, is a knowledge which only the Holy Spirit
   imparts! To apprehend present salvation as your own, personally, comes
   by your being convinced of it by the Spirit. Oh, to be convinced of
   righteousness and convinced of acceptance in the Beloved! This
   conviction comes only of Him that has called you, even of Him of whom
   the Lord says, "I will put My Spirit within you."

   Furthermore, the Holy Spirit comes into us for purification. "I will
   put My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you
   shall keep My judgments, and do them." When the Spirit comes, He
   infuses a new life, and that new life is a fountain of holiness! The
   new nature cannot sin because it is born of God and, "it is a living
   and incorruptible seed." This life produces good fruit and only good
   fruit. The Holy Spirit is the life of holiness. At the same time, the
   coming of the Holy Spirit into the soul gives a mortal stab to the
   power of sin. The old man is not absolutely dead, but it is crucified
   with Christ. It is under sentence and before the eyes of the Law it is
   dead, but as a man nailed to a cross may linger long, yet he cannot
   live, so the power of evil dies hard, but die it must! Sin is an
   executed criminal--those nails which fasten it to the Cross will hold
   it fast till no breath remains in it. God the Holy Spirit gives the
   power of sin its death wound.

   The old nature struggles in its dying agonies, but it is doomed and die
   it must. But you will never overcome sin by your own power, nor by any
   energy short of that of the Holy Spirit. Resolves may bind it, as
   Samson was bound with cords, but sin will snap the cords asunder. The
   Holy Spirit lays the axe at the root of sin and fall it must. The Holy
   Spirit within a man is "the Spirit of Judgment, the Spirit of Burning."
   Do you know Him in that character? As the Spirit of Judgment, the Holy
   Spirit pronounces sentence on sin and it goes out with the brand of
   Cain upon it. He does more--He delivers sin over to burning. He
   executes the death penalty on that which He has judged. How many of our
   sins have we had to burn alive! And it has cost us no small pain to do
   it. Sin must be got out of us by fire, if no gentler means will
   serve--and the Spirit of God is a consuming fire. Truly, "our God is a
   consuming fire." They paraphrase it, "God out of Christ is a consuming
   fire," but that is not Scripture--it is, "our God," our Covenant God,
   who is a consuming fire to refine us from sin! Has not the Lord said,
   "I will purely purge away all your dross, and take away all your tin"?
   This is what the Spirit does and it is, by no means, easy work for the
   flesh, which would spare many a flattering sin if it could.

   The Holy Spirit bedews the soul with purity till He saturates it. Oh,
   to have a heart saturated with holy influences till it shall be as
   Gideon's fleece, which held so much dew that Gideon could wring out a
   bowl full from it! Oh, that our

   whole nature were filled with the Spirit of God--that we were
   sanctified wholly, body, soul, and spirit! Sanctification is the result
   of the Holy Spirit being put within us.

   Next, the Holy Spirit acts in the heart as the Spirit of preservation.
   Where He dwells, men do not go back to perdition. He works in them a
   watchfulness against temptation day by day. He works in them to wrestle
   against sin. Rather than sin, a Believer would die 10,000 deaths. He
   works union to Christ in Believers, which is the source and guarantee
   of acceptable fruitfulness. He creates in the saints those holy things
   which glorify God, and bless the sons of men. All true fruit is the
   fruit of the Spirit. Every true prayer must be "praying in the Holy
   Spirit." He helps our infirmities in prayer. Even the hearing of the
   Word of the Lord is of the Spirit, for John says, "I was in the Spirit
   on the Lord's Day, and heard behind me a great voice." Everything that
   comes of the man, or is kept alive in the man, is first infused and
   then sustained and perfected of the Spirit. "It is the spirit that
   quickens; the flesh profits nothing." We never go an inch towards
   Heaven in any other power than that of the Holy Spirit. We do not even
   stand fast and remain steadfast except as we are upheld by the Holy
   Spirit.

   The vineyard which the Lord has planted, He also preserves, as it is
   written, "I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
   hurt it, I will keep it night and day." Did I hear that young man say,
   "I should like to become a Christian, but I fear I should not hold
   out"? How am I to be preserved? A very proper inquiry for, "He that
   endures to the end, the same shall be saved." Temporary Christians are
   not Christians! Only the Believer who continues to believe will enter
   Heaven. How, then, can we hold on in such a world as this? Here is the
   answer. "I will put My Spirit within you." When a city has been
   captured in war, those who formerly possessed it seek to win it back
   again, but the king who captured it sends a garrison to live within the
   walls. And he says to the captain, "Take care of this city that I have
   conquered and let not the enemy take it again." So the Holy Spirit is
   the garrison of God within our redeemed humanity and He will keep us to
   the end. "May the peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep
   your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." For preservation, then, we
   look to the Holy Spirit.

   Lest I weary you, I will be very brief upon the next point. The Holy
   Spirit within us is for guidance. The Holy Spirit is given to lead us
   into all the Truth of God. Truth is like a vast grotto and the Holy
   Spirit brings torches and shows us all the splendor of the ceiling. And
   since the passages seem intricate, He knows the way, and He leads us
   into the deep things of God. He opens up to us one Truth after another
   by His light and by His guidance, and thus we are "taught of the Lord."
   He is also our practical Guide to Heaven, helping and directing us on
   the upward journey. I wish Christian people oftener inquired of the
   Holy Spirit as to guidance in their daily life. Know you not that the
   Spirit of God dwells in you? You need not always be running to this
   friend and to that to get direction--wait upon the Lord in silence--sit
   still in quiet before the oracle of God. Use the judgment God has given
   you, but when that suffices not, resort to Him whom Mr. Bunyan calls,
   "the Lord High Secretary," who lives within, who is infinitely wise,
   and who can guide you by making you to "hear a voice behind you saying,
   This is the way, walk you in it." The Holy Spirit will guide you in
   life. He will guide you in death and He will guide you to Glory. He
   will guard you from modern error and from ancient error, too. He will
   guide you in a way that you know not--and through the darkness He will
   lead you in a way you have not seen--these things will He do for you
   and not forsake you.

   Oh, this precious text! I seem to have before me a great cabinet full
   of rich and rare jewels. May God the Holy Spirit, Himself, come and
   hand these out to you and may you be adorned with them all the days of
   your life!

   Last of all, "I will put My Spirit within you," that is, by way of
   consolation, for His choice name is, "The Comforter." Our God would not
   have His children unhappy and, therefore, He Himself, in the third
   Person of the blessed Trinity, has undertaken the office of Comforter.
   Why does your face wear such mournful colors? God can comfort you! You
   that are under the burden of sin, it is true no man can help you into
   peace, but the Holy Spirit can! O God, to every seeker here who has
   failed to find rest, grant Your Holy Spirit! Put Your Spirit within him
   and he will rest in Jesus! And you dear people of God who are worried,
   remember that worry and the Holy Spirit are very contradictory one to
   another! "I will put My Spirit within you" means that you shall become
   gentle, peaceful, resigned and acquiescent in the Divine will. Then you
   will have faith in God that all is well!

   That text with which I began my prayer this morning was brought home to
   my heart this week. Our dearly beloved friend, Adolph Saphir, passed
   away last Saturday and his wife died three or four days before him.
   When my dear Brother, Dr. Sinclair Patteson, went to see him, the
   beloved Saphir said to him, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at
   all."

   Nobody would have quoted that passage but Saphir, the Bible student,
   the lover of the Word, the lover of the God of Israel. "God is light,
   and in Him is no darkness at all." His dear wife is gone and he,
   himself is ill, but, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all."
   This is a deep well of overflowing comfort, if you understand it well.
   God's Providence is light as well as His promise--and the Holy Spirit
   makes us know this. God's Word and will and way are all light to His
   people and in Him is no darkness at all for them. God Himself is purely
   and only light.

   What if there is darkness in me? There is no darkness in Him and His
   Spirit causes me to fly to Him! What if there is darkness in my family?
   There is no darkness in my Covenant God and His Spirit makes me rest in
   Him! What if there is darkness in my body by reason of my failing
   strength? There is no failing in Him and there is no darkness in
   Him--His Spirit assures me of this! David says--"God my exceeding
   joy"--and such He is to us. "Yes, my own God is He!" Can you say, "My
   God, my God"? Do you need anything more? Can you conceive of anything
   beyond your God? Omnipotent to work all forever! Infinite to give!
   Faithful to remember! He is all that is good! Light only--"in Him is no
   darkness at all." I have all light, yes, all things, when I have my
   God! The Holy Spirit makes us apprehend this when He is put within us.
   Holy Comforter, abide with us, for then we enjoy the Light of Heaven!
   Then are we always peaceful and even joyful, for we walk in the
   unclouded Light of God. In Him our happiness sometimes rises into great
   waves of delight, as if it leaped up to Glory. The Lord make this text
   your own--"I will put My Spirit within you." Amen.

The Sword of the Spirit

   (No. 2201)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 19, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." Ephesians
   6:17.

   To be a Christian is to be a warrior. The good soldier of Jesus Christ
   must not expect to find ease in this world--it is a battlefield!
   Neither must he reckon upon the friendship of the world, for that would
   be enmity against God. His occupation is war. As he puts on, piece by
   piece, the panoply provided for him, he may wisely say to himself,
   "This warns me of danger; this prepares me for warfare; this prophesies
   opposition."

   Difficulties meet us even in standing our ground, for the Apostle, two
   or three times, bids us--"Stand." In the rush of the fight, men are apt
   to be carried off their legs. If they can keep their footing, they will
   be victorious, but if they are borne down by the rush of their
   adversaries, everything is lost. You are to put on the heavenly armor
   in order that you may stand. And you will need it to maintain the
   position in which your Captain has placed you. If even to stand
   requires all this care, judge you what the warfare must be! The Apostle
   also speaks of withstanding as well as standing. We are not merely to
   defend, but also to attack. It is not enough that you are not
   conquered, you have to conquer and, therefore, we find that we are to
   take, not only a helmet to protect the head, but also a sword with
   which to annoy the foe. Ours, therefore, is a stern conflict, standing
   and withstanding--and we shall need all the armor from the Divine
   magazine, all the strength from the mighty God of Jacob!

   It is clear from our text that our defense and our conquest must be
   obtained by sheer fighting. Many try compromise, but if you are a true
   Christian, you can never do this business well. The language of deceit
   fits not a holy tongue. The adversary is the father of lies and those
   that are with him understand the art of equivocation, but saints abhor
   it. If we discuss terms of peace and attempt to gain something by
   policy, we have entered upon a course from which we shall return in
   disgrace. We have no order from our Captain to patch up a truce and get
   as good terms as we can. We are not sent out to offer concessions! It
   is said that if we yield a little, perhaps the world will yield a
   little, also, and good may come of it. If we are not too strict and
   narrow, perhaps sin will kindly consent to be more decent. Our
   association with it will prevent its being so barefaced and atrocious.
   If we are not narrow-minded, our broad doctrine will go down with the
   world and those on the other side will not be so greedy of error as
   they now are. No such thing! Assuredly this is not the order which our
   Captain has issued. When peace is to be made, He will make it, Himself,
   or He will tell us how to behave to that end. But at present our orders
   are very different.

   Neither may we hope to gain by being neutral, or granting an occasional
   truce. We are not to cease from conflict and try to be as agreeable as
   we can with our Lord's foes, frequenting their assemblies and tasting
   their dainties. No such orders are written here. You are to grasp your
   weapon and go forth to fight.

   Neither may you so much as dream of winning the battle by accident. No
   man was ever holy by a happy chance. Infinite damage may be done by
   carelessness, but no man ever won life's battle by it. To let things go
   on as they please is to let them bear us down to Hell. We have no
   orders to be quiet and take matters easily. No, we are to always pray
   and constantly watch. The one note that rings out from the text is
   this--TAKE THE SWORD! TAKE THE SWORD! No longer is it talk and debate!
   No longer is it parley and compromise! The word of thunder is--Take the
   sword. The Captain's voice is clear as a trumpet--Take the sword! No
   Christian here will have been obedient to our text unless with clear,
   sharp and decisive firmness, courage and resolve, he takes the sword!
   We must go to Heaven with sword in hand, all the way. "TAKE THE SWORD."
   On this command I would enlarge. May the Holy Spirit help me!

   It is noteworthy that there is only one weapon of offense provided,
   although there are several pieces of armor. The Roman soldier usually
   carried a spear as well as a sword. We have seen frequent
   representations of the legionary standing guard as sentry and he almost
   always stands with a spear in his right hand, while his sword hangs at
   his side. But Paul, for excellent reasons, concentrates our offensive
   weapon in one, because it answers for all. We are to use the sword and
   that only. Therefore, if you are going to this fight, see well to your
   only weapon. If you are to have no other, take care that you have this
   always in your hand. Let the Captain's voice ring in your ear, "Take
   the sword! Take the sword!" and so go forth to the field.

   Notice, first, the sword you are to take is the sword of the Spirit,
   which is the Word of God. That is our first head and the second is
   equally upon the surface of the text--This sword is to be ours. We are
   ordered to take the sword of the Spirit and so make it our own sword.

   I. First, the Word of God which is to be our one weapon is of noble
   origin, for IT IS "THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT." It has the properties of a
   sword, and those were given it by the Spirit of God.

   Here we note that the Holy Spirit has a sword. He is quiet as the dew,
   tender as the anointing oil, soft as the zephyr of eventide and
   peaceful as a dove. And yet, under another aspect, He wields a deadly
   weapon. He is the Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning and He
   bears not the sword in vain. Of Him it may be said, "The Lord is a man
   of war: Jehovah is His name."

   The Word of God in the hand of the Spirit wounds very terribly and
   makes the heart of man to bleed. Do you not remember, some of you, when
   you used to be gashed with this sword Sunday after Sunday? Were you not
   cut to the heart by it, so as to be angry with it? You almost made up
   your mind to turn away from hearing the Gospel again. That sword
   pursued you and pierced you in the secrets of your soul--and made you
   bleed in a thousand places. At last you were "pricked in the heart,"
   which is a far better thing than being, "cut to the heart"--and then
   execution was done, indeed! That wound was deadly and none but He that
   killed could make you alive! Do you remember how, after this, your sins
   were slain, one after the other? Their necks were laid on the block and
   the Spirit acted as an executioner with His sword. After that, blessed
   be God, your fears, doubts, despair and unbelief were also hacked to
   pieces by this same sword. The Word gave you life! But it was, at the
   first, a great killer. Your soul was like a battlefield after a great
   fight, under the first operations of the Divine Spirit, whose sword
   returns not empty from the conflict.

   Beloved, the Spirit of God has war with the Amalek of evil and error
   from generation to generation. He will spare none of the evils which
   now pollute the nations. His sword will never be quiet till all these
   Canaanites are destroyed. The Holy Spirit glorifies Christ not only by
   what He reveals, but also by what He overturns. The strife may be
   weary, but it will be carried on from age to age, till the Lord Jesus
   shall appear, for the Spirit of God shall always espouse the cause of
   love against hate, of the Truth of God against error, of holiness
   against sin, of Christ against Satan! He will win the day and those who
   are with Him shall, in His might, be more than conquerors. The Holy
   Spirit has proclaimed war and wields a two-edged sword.

   The Holy Spirit wields no sword but the Word of God. This wonderful
   Book, which contains the utterances of God's mouth, is the one weapon
   which the Holy Spirit elects to use for His war-like purposes. It is a
   spiritual weapon and so is suitable to the Holy Spirit. The weapons of
   His warfare are not carnal--He never uses either persecution or
   patronage, force or bribery, glitter of grandeur, or terror of power.
   He works upon men by the Word, which is suitable to His own spiritual
   Nature and to the spiritual work which is to be accomplished. While it
   is spiritual, this weapon is "mighty through God." A cut from the Word
   of God will cleave a man's spirit from head to foot, so sharp is this
   sword! Though by long practice in sin a man may have coated himself as
   with impenetrable mail, yet the Word of the Lord will divide the
   northern iron and the steel. The Holy Spirit can make a man feel the
   Divine power of the sacred Word in the very center of his being!

   For battling with the spirits of man, or with spirits of an infernal
   kind, there is no weapon so keen, so piercing, so able to divide
   between the joints and marrow, so penetrating as to the thoughts and
   intents of the heart. The Word, in the Spirit's hand, gives no
   superficial wound, but cuts into the man's heart, and so wounds him
   that there is no healing save by supernatural power! The wounded
   conscience will bleed; its pains will be upon it day and night; and
   though it seeks out a thousand medicines, no salve but one can cure a
   gash which this terrible sword has made. This weapon is
   two-edged--indeed, it is all edge--and whichever way it strikes, it
   wounds and kills. There is no such a thing as the flat of

   the sword of the Spirit--it has a razor edge every way. Beware how you
   handle it, you critics! It may wound even you. It will cut you to your
   destruction, one of these days, unless you are converted. He that uses
   the Word in the Lord's battles may use it upon carnal hopes and then
   strike back upon unbelieving fears. He may smite with one edge, the
   love of sin, and then with the other, the pride of self-righteousness.
   It is a conquering weapon in all ways, this wondrous sword of

   the Spirit of God!

   The Word, we say, is the only sword which the Spirit uses. I know the
   Holy Spirit uses gracious sermons, but it is only in proportion as they
   have the Word of God in them. I know the Holy Spirit uses religious
   books, but only so far as they are the Word of God told out in other
   languages. Conviction, conversion and consolation are still worked, but
   only by the Word of God. Learn, then, the wisdom of using the Word of
   God for holy purposes. The Spirit has abundant ability to speak of His
   own self, apart from the written Word. The Holy Spirit is God and,
   therefore, He is the greatest spirit in the universe. All wisdom dwells
   in Him. He thought out the laws which govern Nature and direct
   Providence. The Holy Spirit is the great Teacher of human spirits--He
   taught Bezaleel and the artificers in the wilderness how to make the
   fine linen and the gold and carved work for the Tabernacle. All arts
   and sciences are perfectly known to Him and infinitely more than men
   can ever discover. Yet He will not use these things in this holy
   controversy. In the quarrel of His Covenant, He uses neither
   philosophy, nor science, nor rhetoric. In contending against the powers
   of darkness, "The sword of the Spirit is the Word of God." "It is
   written" is His masterstroke! Words which God has spoken by holy men of
   old and has caused to be recorded on the sacred page--these are the
   battle-axe and weapons of war of His Spirit! This Book contains the
   Word of God and is the Word of God--and this it is which the Holy
   Spirit judges to be so effectual a weapon against evil that He uses
   this, and only this, as His sword in the great conflict with the powers
   of darkness.

   The Word is the sword of the Spirit because it is of His own making. He
   will not use a weapon of human workmanship, lest the sword boast itself
   against the hand that wields it. The Holy Spirit revealed the mind of
   God to the minds of holy men. He spoke the Word into their hearts and
   thus He made them think as He would have them think and to write what
   He willed them to write--so that what they spoke and wrote was spoken
   and written as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. Blessed be the Holy
   Spirit for deigning to use so many writers and yet, Himself, to remain
   the veritable Author of this collection of holy Books! We are grateful
   for Moses, for David, for Isaiah, for Paul, for Peter, for John, but
   most of all for that superintending Editor, that innermost Author of
   the whole sacred Volume--even the Holy Spirit!

   A warrior may well be careful as to the make of His sword. If a man had
   made his own sword, had tempered the metal, had, himself, passed the
   blade through many fires, and worked it to perfection--then, if he were
   a skillful workman, he would feel confidence in his sword. When work is
   done, nowadays, it is, as a rule, badly done. Work done by contract is
   usually done poorly in some part or another. But when a man does a work
   for himself, he is likely to do it thoroughly, and produce an article
   which he can depend upon. The Holy Spirit has made this Book,
   Himself--every portion of it bears His initial and impress--and thus He
   has a sword worthy of His own hands, a true Jerusalem blade of heavenly
   fabric. He delights to use a weapon so Divinely made and He does use it
   right gloriously!

   The Word of God is also the sword of the Spirit because He puts the
   edge upon it. It is because He is in it that it is so keen and cutting.
   I believe in the Inspiration of Holy Scripture, not only in the day
   when it was written, but onward, and even to this day. It is still
   Inspired. The Holy Spirit still breathes through the chosen Words. I
   told you the sword was all edge, but I would add that the Holy Spirit
   makes it so. It would have no edge at all if it were not for His
   Presence within it and His perpetual working by it. How many people
   read their Bibles and yet derive no more benefit from it than if they
   had read an old almanac! In fact, they would more easily keep awake
   over an ancient Bradshaw than over a chapter of Scripture. The
   ministers of the Gospel may preach God's Word in all sincerity and
   purity and yet, if the Spirit of God is not present, we might as well
   have preached mere moral essays, for no good can come of our testimony.
   The Holy Spirit rides in the chariot of Scripture and not in the wagon
   of modern thought. Scripture is that Ark of the Covenant which contains
   the golden pot of manna and also bears above it the Divine Light of
   God's shining. The Spirit of God works in, by, through and with the
   Word--and if we keep to that Word, we may rest assured that the Holy
   Spirit will stay with us and make our testimony to be a thing of power.
   Let us pray the blessed Spirit to put an edge on our preaching, lest we
   say much and accomplish little! Hear us in this thing, O blessed One!

   It is "the sword of the Spirit" because He alone can instruct us in the
   use of it. You think, young man, that you can pick up your Bible and go
   and preach from it at once, properly and successfully? You have made a
   presumptuous mistake!

   A sword is a weapon which may do hurt to the man who flourishes with it
   in mere wanton pride. No one can handle the sword of the Spirit aright
   save the chosen man whom God has ordained from before the foundation of
   the world and trained in feats of arms. By this, the elect of God are
   known--that they love the Word of God and they have a reverence for
   it--and discern between it and the words of man. Notice the lambs in
   the field, just now, and there may be a thousand ewes and lambs, but
   every lamb can find its own mother. So does a true-born child of God
   know where to go for the milk which is to nourish his soul. The sheep
   of Christ know the Shepherd's voice in the Word and they will not
   follow a stranger, for they know not the voice of strangers. God's own
   people have discernment to discover and relish God's own Word. They
   will not be misled by the cunning craftiness of human devices! Saints
   know the Scriptures by inward instinct. The holy life, which God has
   infused into Believers by His Spirit, loves the Scriptures, and learns
   how to use them for holy purposes.

   Young soldier, you must go to the training ground of the Holy Spirit to
   be made a proficient swordsman. You will go in vain to the
   metaphysician or to the logician, for neither of these know how to
   handle a spiritual weapon. In other arts they may be masters, but in
   the sacred use of Divine theology, they are mere fools! In the things
   of the Word we are dunces till we enter the school of the Holy Spirit.
   He must take of the things of Christ and show them to us. He must teach
   us how to grip this sword by faith and how to hold it by watchfulness,
   so as to parry the adversary's thrust and carry the war into the
   foeman's territory. He is well taught, who can swing this great
   two-handed sword to and fro and mow a lane through the midst of his
   opponents, and come out a conqueror at the end. It may take a long time
   to learn this art, but we have a right skillful Teacher. Those of us
   who have been in this warfare 30 or 40 years, feel that we have not yet
   reached the full use of this sword! No, I, for one, know that I need to
   be taught daily how to use this mysterious weapon which is capable of
   so much more than I have yet supposed. It is the sword of the Spirit,
   adapted for the use of an Almighty arm and, therefore, equal to the
   doing of far more than we think. Holy Spirit, teach us now feats of
   arms by this, Your sword!

   But, chiefly, it is the sword of the Spirit, because He is the great
   Master in the use of it. Oh, that He would come and show us, this
   morning, how He can thrust and cleave with it! In this house of prayer
   we have often seen Him at His work. Here the slain of the Lord have
   been many. We have seen this sword take off the head of many a Goliath
   doubt and slay a horde of cares and unbeliefs! We have seen the Spirit
   pile up heaps on heaps of the slain when the Word of conviction has
   gone forth--and men have seen sin to be sin--and fallen down as dead
   before the Lord and His Law. We also know what the use of the sword by
   the Spirit of God means, for within our own being He has left marks of
   His prowess. He has killed our doubts and fears and left no more
   mistrusts to worry us.

   There was a man of God who was frequently subject to doubts, even
   doubts upon the fundamentals of religion. He hated this state of mind,
   but still, he could not get rid of the habit of evil questioning. In
   answer to prayer, the Spirit came and convinced him of the pride of his
   intellect and of the wickedness of setting up his judgment against the
   Word of the Lord--and from that day forward he was never the subject of
   another fit of unbelief! He saw things clearly in the Light of the Holy
   Spirit and that is to see them, indeed! The great giant of doubt is
   sorely wounded by the sword of the Spirit--yes, he is slain
   outright--for the Spirit works in the Believer such a conviction of the
   Truth of God that assurance banishes suspicion! When the Holy Spirit
   deals with the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eyes and the pride
   of life, these also lie at His feet, trophies to the power of His
   mighty weapon, even the Word of God! The Holy Spirit is glorious in the
   use of this sword. He finds that this weapon suits His hand and He
   seeks no other! Let us use it, also, and be glad to do so. Though it is
   the sword of the Spirit, yet our feeble hand may grasp it. Yes, and
   find in the grasping, that somewhat of the Divine power comes unto our
   arm!

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, is it not a very high honor put upon you, as
   soldiers of the Cross, that you should be allowed, no, commanded to
   take the sword of the Spirit? The raw recruit is not trusted with the
   general's sword, but here you are, armed with the weapon of God, the
   Holy Spirit, and called upon to bear that sacred sword which is so
   gloriously wielded by the Lord God, Himself! This we are to bear, and
   no other. Does the timid heart enquire, "How, my Master, shall I meet
   my adversaries"? "Here," says the Holy Spirit, "take this! This is My
   own sword. I have done great marvels with it. Take it and nothing shall
   stand against you." When you remember the potency of this sword. When
   the Spirit tests it upon yourself, you may take it with confidence, and
   use it in your holy war with full assurance. That Word of God which
   could convert you, can convert anybody! If it could kill your despair,
   it can remove another man's despon-

   dency. If it has conquered your pride and self-will, it can subdue the
   same in your children and your neighbors. Having done what it has
   certainly done for you, you may have a full persuasion that, before its
   power, no case is hopeless. Therefore, see to it that you use, from
   this day forth, no other weapon than the sword of the Spirit, which is
   the Word of God.

   II. This fairly lands me in the second portion of my discourse. The
   Word of God is the sword of the Spirit, but IT IS ALSO TO BE OUR SWORD.

   Here I must begin again and go over much of the same ground. We shall
   need a sword. Our warfare is not child's play--we mean business. We
   have to deal with fierce foes who are only to be met with keen weapons.
   Buffets will not suffice in this contest--we must come to sword-cuts.
   You may be of a very quiet spirit, but your adversaries are not! If you
   attempt to play at Christian warfare, they will not. To meet the powers
   of darkness is no sham battle. They mean mischief. Nothing but your
   eternal damnation will satisfy the fiendish hearts of Satan and his
   crew. You must take not so much a flag to unfurl, or a drum to beat, as
   a sword to use and an especially sharp sword, too. In this combat you
   will have to use a sword such as even evil spirits can feel, capable of
   dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow. If
   you are to live through this fight and come off victorious, no form of
   conflict will suffice less sharp and cutting than sword-work.

   Depend upon it that in this struggle you will be forced to come to
   close quarters. The foe aims at your heart and pushes home. A spear
   will not do, nor bow and arrow--the enemy is too near for anything but
   hand-to-hand fighting. Brothers and Sisters, our foes are not only of
   our house, but of our heart! I find an enemy within which is always
   near and I cannot get away from him. I find that my antagonist will get
   his hand on my throat if he can. If our foes were far away and we could
   reach them with artillery which would kill at six or seven miles'
   distance, we might lead a pretty easy life. But no, they are here! At
   our doors! Yes, within us--nearer than hands and feet. Now for the
   short sword! The claymore of Holy Scripture, to stab and cut, near and
   now. No sling and stone will avail us here, but we must take the sword.
   You have to slay your foe, or your foe will slay you! It is with us
   Christians as it was with the Highlanders in battle, when their leader
   called out to them, "Lads, there they are! If you dinna kill them they
   will kill you." There is no room for peace--it is war to the knife, not
   only now, but to life's end!

   The use of the sword is necessary for attack. I have reminded you
   several times already that it will not suffice for the Christian to
   guard against sin and ward off temptation from himself--he has to
   attack the powers of evil. In our case, the best method of defense is
   an attack. I have heard of one who would bring an action in law to gain
   his ends, for he thought this better than being the defendant. That may
   be matter of question, but in war it is often safer to attack than
   defend. Carry the warfare into the enemy's territory. Be trying to win
   from the adversary and he will not win so much from you. Do not merely
   be sober, yourselves, but attack drunkenness. Do not be content with
   being free from superstition, yourself, but expose it wherever it
   appears! Do not merely be devout when you feel obliged to be so, but
   pray for the growth of the kingdom--pray always! Do not merely say, "I
   will keep Satan out of my family by bringing up my children aright,"
   but go to the Sunday school and teach other children, and so carry the
   war over the border! God forbid that we should ever go to war as a
   nation! But if we were at war with some nation on the Continent, I
   would certainly say, "Let the Continentals have the battles on their
   own ground--we do not want a campaign over here." It is wise to keep
   the war in the enemy's own regions. If we had fought the devil more in
   the world, he might never have been able to invade the Church so
   terribly as he has done. Attack with the sword, for it is your calling,
   and thus will you best defend yourself.

   We need the sword for real fighting. Do you think that you can dream
   yourselves into Heaven? Or ride there in the chariot of ease? Or fly on
   the wings of brass music? You make a great mistake if you so imagine. A
   real war is raging! Your opponents are in deadly earnest and you must
   take your sword!

   And, further, we need this sword, this sword of the Spirit, which is
   the Word of God. We say with David, "There is none like that; give it
   to me." It has worked such wonders that we prefer it to all others. No
   other will match the enemy's weapon. If we fight the devil with human
   reason, the first time our wooden sword comes in contact with a Satanic
   temptation it will be cut in pieces! If you do not wield a true
   Jerusalem blade, you are in grave peril--your weapon will break off at
   the hilt--and where will you be? Standing defenseless, with nothing but
   the handle of a broken sword in your hand, you will be the object of
   your adversary's ridicule! You must have this sword, for no other will
   penetrate the foe, and no other will last out the battle. After 20
   years, what has become of the pious resolutions of your youth? What is
   the

   staying power of your consecration made in the hour of enthusiasm?
   Alas, how little trust can be placed in it! What would become of us
   after 30 years of fighting if we had not the Word of God to rely upon?
   The Word of the Lord endures forever, but nothing else does. We may do
   well in early days, but we shall fail in old age if we have not eternal
   Truths of God to fall back upon.

   I can commend this sword to you all, my Brothers and Sisters, although
   you are so varied in character. This sword suits every hand. Youth or
   age may, alike, use this weapon. These dear girls from the Orphanage
   and yonder lads from the Bible class, may fight the battle of their
   youth with the Word of God, for Holy Scripture may impress and guide
   our freshest life. You that have grown gray. You that have passed 70 or
   80, you will value the Bible more than ever and you will find that this
   sword is the best for veteran warriors. Young men and young women, here
   is a sword suited for all of you, and well does it become the hand of
   the feeblest and the gentlest! The Holy Spirit has, in the sacred Word,
   prepared an implement of warfare suited for great minds and small, for
   the cultured and the uneducated. A wonderful sword this is, which, in
   the hands of faith, reveals an adaptation marvelous to the last degree!

   Whatever others may say, it is sufficient for us that this is the
   regulation sword. A soldier is not left to choose his own equipment. He
   must carry such arms as his sovereign appoints. This is the regulation
   sword in Christ's army. The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
   God, is what you are bid to take and, if you, in willfulness, resolve
   to exchange it for another, you commit an act of rebellion and you make
   the change at your own risk and peril! Come, then, let us each take the
   Word of God and carry it nearer our hearts than ever, for such is the
   Word of command, "Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
   God."

   Now, see what we are told to do. We need a sword. We need this sword.
   We are to take this sword. Note that we are not told that we may lay it
   down--the demand to take the sword is continuous and there is no hint
   of its being suspended. There is a time, of course, when the soldier of
   Her Majesty may remove his sword from his side and take off his
   regimentals, but there is never such a time with a Christian! One might
   have thought, from what we have seen of late, that orders had come from
   headquarters that the soldiers were to lay down the sword of the
   Spirit, the Word of God, and take to lighter weapons. Entertainments,
   amusements, farces, and sing-songs are now used to do what the Gospel
   has failed to achieve! Is it not sadly so? Well, if any will try these
   silly toys, I can only say that they have no command from their Lord to
   warrant them in their proceedings. Take all these things and see what
   they will do, but you make the trial at your own risk, and on your own
   heads the result of failure will fall.

   The standing orders are to take the sword of the Spirit and no new
   regulation has ever been issued by the great Captain of salvation. From
   the days of Paul till now, the Word stands, "Take the sword of the
   Spirit." All other things will surely fail and, therefore, the one sole
   abiding command is, "Take the sword of the Spirit." We are not told to
   hang up this sword for exhibition. Certain people have a
   handsomely-bound Bible to lie upon the table of the best room--and a
   fine ornament it is! A Family Bible is a treasure! But I pray you, do
   not let your love of the Bible end there. With a soldier in war, a
   sword is not meant to be hung up in the tent, nor even to be flourished
   in the air, but it is issued to be used. Nor are we to push this sword
   into a sheath, as many do who take the Bible and add so much of
   criticism, or of their own opinion to it, that its edge is not felt!
   Many men use their low opinion of Inspiration as a scabbard into which
   they push the Bible down. Their vast knowledge makes a beautiful
   scabbard and they push down the sword, saying, "Keep still, there! O
   sword of the Lord, rest and be quiet!" After we have preached our heart
   out, and men have felt the power of it, they make a desperate effort to
   imprison the Word in their unbelieving theory, or in their worldliness.
   They hold down the Word all the week with a firm hand, for fear its
   edge or point should wound them. It is the scabbard of culture, or
   philosophy, or of progress--and in this they shut up the living Word of
   God as in a coffin!

   We are not to bury the Word under other matters, but we are to take it
   as a sword, which means, as I understand it, first, believe it. Believe
   every portion of it. Believe it with a true and real faith, not with a
   mere creedal faith which says, "This is the orthodox thing." Believe it
   as a matter of fact for every day, affecting your life. Believe it! And
   when you have believed it, then study it. Oh, for a closer study of the
   Word of God! Are there not some of you who have never even heard or
   read all that the Lord has said? Are there not passages of the Bible
   which have never been read by you? It is a melancholy fact that there
   would be even a line of the sacred Scriptures which has never once come
   under your eyes. Read the Bible right through, from beginning to end.

   Begin tomorrow--no, begin today--and go steadily through the whole of
   the sacred Book, with prayer and meditation. Never let it be suspected
   by you that God has recorded Truths in His Word which you have never
   even once read. Study the Word and work out its meaning. Go deep into
   the spirit of Inspiration. He gets most gold who digs the deepest in
   this mine. They used to say of certain mines in Cornwall that the
   deeper you went the richer was the ore. Assuredly is it so with the
   mines of Inspired Scripture. The deeper you go under the Spirit's
   guidance, the larger is the reward for your toil. Take the sword with
   the grip of sincere faith. Hold it fast by a fuller knowledge. And then
   exercise yourself daily in its use. The sword is to be taken for
   earnest fight. You will not be long before occasion arises in such a
   world as this. You will have to parry with it, to pierce with it, to
   cut with it and to kill with it. "Where shall I begin?" says one. Begin
   at home and, for many a day, you will have your hands full! When you
   have slain all the rebels at home and long before that, you may take a
   turn at those around you in the world, and in the professing church.

   Inside your own heart you will find a band of bandits which should be
   exterminated. There will always be need to keep the sword going within
   your own territory. End this civil war before you go into foreign
   parts. When the war within the city of Mansoul has been victoriously
   carried through, besiege the heart of your friend, your child, your
   neighbor. Behold, the world lies in the Wicked One! Errors abound and
   colossal systems of falsehood still stand aloft. Men are still dragged
   down by the arch-deceiver. Surely, we feel our swords flying out of
   their sheaths when we think of the millions who are being ruined by sin
   and error! Oh, for a mighty onslaught upon the powers of darkness!

   Once more, we are to take this sword with a purpose. We are to use it
   that we may be able to stand and to withstand. If you want to stand,
   draw the sword and smite your doubts. How fiercely unbelief assails!
   Here comes a doubt as to your election. Pierce it through with the
   Word. Soon comes a doubt as to the precious blood. Cleave it from head
   to foot with the assurance of the Word that the blood of Jesus cleanses
   us from all sin! Here comes another doubt and yet another. As quick as
   arm can move, drive texts of Scripture through every new fallacy, every
   new denial of the Truth of God and spit the whole of them upon the
   rapier of the Word! It will be for your good to kill these doubts
   outright. Do not play with them, but fight them in real earnest! You
   will find, also, that temptations will come in hordes. Meet them with
   the precepts of sacred Writ and slay even the desire of evil by the
   Spirit's application of the Holy Word! The washing of water by the Word
   is a glorious cleanser. Discouragements will arise like mists of the
   morning. Oh, that God's Word may shine them away with the beams of the
   promises! Your afflictions multiply and you will never be able to
   overcome impatience and distrust except by the Infallible Word of God.
   You can bear trial and bear it patiently, if you use this weapon to
   kill anxiety. You will "stand fast in the evil day" and, having done
   all, you will still stand, if this sword is in your hand.

   You have not only to stand fast, yourselves, but you have to win souls
   for Christ! Do not try to conquer sin in others, or capture a heart for
   Jesus except with the sword of the Spirit. How the devil laughs when we
   try to make converts apart from Holy Scripture and the Holy Spirit! He
   laughs, I say, for he derides our folly. What can you do, you children,
   playing with your little wooden swords--what can you do against men
   covered from head to foot with the steel mail of the habit of sin?
   Sunday school teachers, teach your children more and more the pure Word
   of God! And preachers, do not try to be original, but be content to
   take of the things of Christ and show them to the people, for that is
   what the Holy Spirit, Himself does--and you will be wise to use His
   method and His sword. No sinner around you will be saved except by the
   knowledge of the great Truths contained in the Word of God. No man will
   ever be brought to repentance, to faith and to life in Christ, apart
   from the constant application of the Truth through the Spirit.

   I hear great shouting, great noises everywhere, about great things that
   are going to be done--let us see them! The whole world is going to be
   embraced within the Church, so they say. I fear the world will not be
   much the better for inclusion in such a church! Big boasters should
   heed the word of the wise man, "Let not him that girds on his harness
   boast himself as he that takes it off." If the champion goes forth with
   any other sword than the Word of God, he had better not boast at all,
   for he will come back with his sword broken, his shield cast away, and
   himself grimy with dishonor. Defeat awaits that man who forsakes the
   Word of the Lord!

   I have done when I have asked you to remember that the text is in the
   present tense--Take unto you the sword of the Spirit even now. What
   varieties of people there are here this morning! Believers have come
   here in all sorts of perils. Let them each one take the sword of the
   Spirit and they will overcome every foe! Here, too, are seekers who
   wish to be Christians, but they cannot compass it. What is the matter
   this morning? "Oh," says one, "I have been in the habit of sinning, and
   the habit is very strong upon me." Fight with sinful habits with the
   Word of God, as the sword of the Spirit--so

   only will you conquer your evil self. Find a text of Scripture that
   will cleave your sin down to the backbone, or stab it to the heart.
   "Alas, Satan tempts me horribly," cries one, "I have been lately
   assailed in many ways." Have you? You are not the first. Our Divine
   Lord in the wilderness was tempted of the devil. He might have fought
   Satan with a thousand weapons, but He chose to defeat him with only
   one. He said, "It is written. It is written. It is written." He pricked
   the foeman so sorely with this sharp point that the arch-adversary
   thought to try the same sword--and he also began to say, "It is
   written." But he cut himself with this sword, for he did not quote the
   passages correctly, nor give the whole of them--and the Master soon
   found the way to knock aside his sword and wound him still more.

   Follow your Lord's example. "Oh, but," says one," I am so low in
   spirits." Very well. Fight lowness of spirits with the Word of God.
   "The doctor recommended me," says one, "to take a little spirits to
   raise my spirits." Those doctors are always having this sin laid to
   their charge. I am not so sure that they are not often maligned. You
   like the dose and that is why you take it! Try the Word of God for
   lowness of spirits and you will have found a sure remedy. I find, if I
   can lay a promise under my tongue, like a sweet lozenge, and keep it in
   my mouth or mind all the day long, I am happy enough. If I cannot find
   a Scripture to comfort me, then my inward troubles are multiplied.
   Fight despondency and despair with the sword of the Spirit. I cannot
   tell what your particular difficulty may be at this moment, but I give
   you this direction for all holy warfare--"Take the sword of the Spirit,
   which is the Word of God."

   You must overcome every enemy, but this weapon is all you need! If you,
   my Hearer, would overcome sin and conquer unbelief, take such a word as
   this, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth." And
   as you look you shall be saved--and doubt shall die--and sin be slain!
   God grant you His Spirit's aid, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Ephesians 6.

"Lo, I Come"--Exposition

   (No. 2202)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING. APRIL 26, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, My ears ha ve You opened:
   burnt offering and sin offering have You not required. Then said I, Lo,
   I have come--in the volume of the Book it is written of Me--I delight
   to do Your will, O My God: yes, Your Law is within My heart." Psalm
   40:6-8.

   Explained to us by the Apostle Paul in Hebrews 10:5-7--

   "Therefore when He came into the world, He said, Sacrifice and offering
   You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me. In burnt
   offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure. Then I said, Lo,
   I come--in the volume of the Book it is written of Me--To do your will,
   O God."

   WE have, in the use made of the passage by the inspired Apostle,
   sufficient authority for applying the quotation from the 40th Psalm to
   our Divine Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. With such a commentary, we are
   sure of our way and our whereabouts. We might have been perplexed as to
   its meaning had it not have been for this, although I think, even
   without the guidance of the New Testament passage, those who are
   familiar with Holy Writ would have felt that the words could not be
   fulfilled in David, but must belong to a greater than he, even to the
   Divine Messiah, who, in the fullness of time, would come into the
   world. We rejoice that the Lord Jesus, Himself, here speaks of Himself.
   Who but He can declare His own generation? Here He is both the subject
   of the Words and the Speaker. The Word is from Himself and of Himself
   and so we have double reason for devout attention. He tells us what He
   said long ago. He declares, "Then I said, Lo, I come." Because He has
   come to us, we gladly come to Him, and now we reverently wait upon Him
   to hear what our Lord shall speak, for, doubtless, He will speak peace
   to us, and will cause us to learn, through His Spirit, the meaning of
   His Words. O Savior, say to each of our hearts, "Lo, I come"!

   I. Without further preface, I call upon you to notice, first, THE
   SWEEPING AWAY OF THE SHADOW. "Sacrifice and offering You did not
   desire. . .burnt offering and sin offering have You not required."

   When the Son of God is born into the world, there is an end of all
   types by which He was formerly prefigured. The symbols end when the
   Truth, itself, is made fully manifest. The sacrifices of the Law had
   their times and place, their teaching and their influence. Blessed were
   those in Israel whose spiritual minds saw beneath the outward sign and
   discerned the inward Truth of God! To them the sacrifices of the holy
   place were a standing means of fellowship with God. Day after day they
   saw the Great Propitiation as they beheld the morning and the evening
   lamb--so often as they looked upon a sacrifice, they beheld the Lamb of
   God which takes away the sin of the world! In the Paschal supper they
   were instructed, by the slaying of the unblemished victim, the roasting
   with fire, the sprinkling of the blood upon the door outside and the
   feasting upon the sacrifice within.

   Spiritual men could have found in the rites and ceremonies of the old
   Law a very library of Gospel literature! But, alas, the people were
   carnal, sensual and unbelieving and, therefore, they often forgot,
   even, to celebrate the appointed sacrifices. The Passover, itself,
   ceased for long periods and when the festivals were maintained, there
   was no life or reality in them. After they had been chastened for their
   neglect and made to wander in exile because of the wandering of their
   hearts after their idols, they were restored from captivity and were
   led to keep the Ceremonial Law, but they did it as a heartless,
   meaningless formality--and thus missed all spiritual benefit--with the
   unlighted candle in their hand they

   blindly groped in the dark. They slew the sacrifices and presented
   their peace offerings, but the soul had gone out of the service and, at
   last, their God grew weary of their formal worship and said, "Bring no
   more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto Me."

   We read, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me?
   says the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of
   fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or
   of he-goats. When you come to appear before Me, who has required this
   at your hand, to tread my courts?" When once the life is gone out of
   the best symbolism, the Lord abhors the carcass and even a
   Divinely-ordained ritual becomes a species of idolatry! When the heart
   is gone out of the externals of worship, they are as shells without the
   kernel. Habitations without living tenants soon become desolations--and
   so do forms and ceremonies without their spiritual meaning. Toward the
   time of our Lord's coming, the outward worship of Judaism became more
   and more dead--it was time that it was buried. It had decayed and waxed
   old and was ready to vanish away--and vanish away it did--for our Lord
   set aside the first, or old, that He might establish the second, or
   new. The stars were no longer seen with their twinkling, for the sun
   had risen!

   The removal of these things was wholesale. We have four sorts of
   sacrifice mentioned here, but I need not go into details. Sacrifices in
   which blood was shed were abolished when the Son of God offered Himself
   without spot unto God. Bloodless offerings, such as fine flour, wine,
   oil, sweet cane bought with money and precious incense--which were
   tokens of gratitude and consecration--these, also, were no longer laid
   upon the altar. Both sacrifice and offering were not desired. And burnt
   offerings, which signified the delight of God in the great Sacrifice,
   were ended by the Lord's actual acceptance of that Sacrifice, itself!
   Even the sin offering, which was burned outside the camp as a thing
   accursed, ceased altogether. It represented sin laid upon the victim
   and the victim's being made a curse on that account. It might have
   seemed always useful as a reminder, for they were always sinning and
   always needing a sin offering, but even this was not required.

   Nothing of the old Ceremonial Law was spared. Now we have no Ark of the
   Covenant, with its Shekinah light between the wings of the cherubim.
   Now we have no bronze laver, no table of showbread, no bronze altar and
   no sacred veil--the Holy of Holies, itself, is gone! Tabernacle and
   Temple are both removed. "Neither in this mountain, nor yet at
   Jerusalem, shall men worship the Father." But the time is come when
   "they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth." A
   clean sweep has been made of all the ancient rites, from circumcision
   up to the garment with its fringe of blue. These were for the childhood
   of the Church, the pictures of her first schoolbooks! But we are no
   longer minors and we have Divine Grace given us to read with opened
   eyes that everlasting classic of "the glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ." Now has the brightness of the former dispensation been quite
   eclipsed by the Glory which excels.

   As these outward things vanish, they go away with God's mark of
   non-esteem upon them--they are such things as He did not desire.
   "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire." The Lord God had no desire
   for matters so trivial and unsatisfactory. They were good for the
   people, to instruct them--if they had been willing to learn--but they
   fulfilled no desire of the heart of God. He says, "Will I eat the flesh
   of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?" By the Prophet Micah, He asks,
   "Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands
   of rivers of oil." These furnish no delight for the Great Spirit and
   give no pleasure to the thrice holy Jehovah! The formal worshipper
   supposed that his offerings were, in and of themselves, pleasing to God
   and, therefore, brought his "burnt offerings, with calves of a year
   old." So far as they believingly understood the meaning of a sacrifice
   and presented it in faith, their offerings were acceptable, but in
   themselves considered, these were far from being what the Lord desired.

   He that fills Heaven and earth says, "I will not reprove you for your
   sacrifices or your burnt offerings, to have been continually before Me.
   I will take no bullock out of your house, nor he-goats out of your
   folds. For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a
   thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild
   beasts of the field are Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you:
   for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof." The spiritual, the
   infinite, the almighty Jehovah could not desire merely outward ritual,
   however it might appear glorious to men! The sweetest music is not for
   His ears, nor the most splendid roses of priests for His eyes. He
   desired something infinitely more precious than these--and He puts them
   away with this note of dissatisfaction.

   And more, these sacrifices passed away with the mark upon them that
   they were not what God required. "Burnt offering and sin offering have
   You not required." What did God require of man? Obedience. He said by
   Samuel, "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat
   of rams." He says in another place, "He has showed you, O man, what is

   good; and what does the Lord require of you, but to do justly, and to
   love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?" The requirement of the
   Law was love to God and love to men. This has always been God's great
   requirement. He seeks spiritual worship, obedient thought, holy living,
   grateful praise, devout prayer--these are the requirements of the
   Creator and Benefactor of men. Ritualistic matters were so far required
   as they might minister to the good of the people and, while they stood,
   they could not neglect them without loss. But they were not the grand
   requirement of a just and holy God and, therefore, men might fulfill
   these without stint or omission, and yet God would not have of them
   what He required. "Yes," He asks, "who has required this at your hand,
   to tread My courts?" To see His Law magnified, His justice vindicated,
   His sovereignty acknowledged and His holiness imitated, is more to His
   mind! Absolute conformity to the standard of moral and spiritual
   rectitude which He has set up is His demand--and He can be content with
   nothing less. These things are not found in sacrifice and offering,
   neither do they always go therewith and, therefore, the outward
   sacrifice was not what God required.

   They were so to be put away as never to be followed by the same kind of
   things. Shadows are not replaced by other shadows! The ceremonials of
   Aaron are not to be followed by another set of carnal ordinances! There
   are some who seem to think that they are to be so. Instead of Aaron,
   whom God ordained, we have a so-called priesthood among us at this day,
   claiming an Apostolic succession, which is impossible if they are
   priests, since no Apostle was a priest! Instead of rites which God has
   ordained, we have rites of man's invention! The blessed ordinances of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, such as Baptism and the Lord's Supper, have been
   prostituted from their instructive and memorial intent into a kind of
   witchcraft, so that by what is called, "baptism," children are said to
   be born again and made members of Christ and children of God! While in
   the second, or what they call, "Holy Communion," the sacrifice of
   Christ is profanely said to be repeated or continued, even in the
   unbloody sacrifice of the "mass."

   Ah, Friends! Our Lord did not put away that grand, magnificent system
   of Mosaic rites to introduce the masquerade in which Rome delights,
   which certain Anglicans would set up among us! No, no! We have done
   with the symbolic system and have now but the two outward ordinances of
   Baptism and the Lord's Supper, which are meant only for Believers who
   know what it is to be buried with Christ and to feed on Him. You have
   no right to bring in your own forms and ceremonies and place them in
   the Church of Christ. Beyond what God has ordained, we may not dare to
   go--and even in those things we may not rest as though there were
   anything in them of their own operation apart from their sacred
   teaching! These are instructive to you if you have a mind to be
   instructed--and if you know the Truths of God which they set forth. But
   do not imagine that men have come under another kind of ceremonialism,
   another system of ritual and rubric, for it is not so. The rites
   appropriate to priests are abolished with the Aaronic priesthood and
   can never be restored-- "He takes away the first, that He may establish
   the second." When He comes into the world, these carnal ordinances must
   go out of the world! Sacrifice and offering, burnt offering and sin
   offering and all other patterns of heavenly things are swept away when
   the heavenly things, themselves, appear!

   II. Thus much upon the shadows being swept away. And now, secondly, let
   us view THE REVELATION OF THE SUBSTANCE. We find the Son of God,
   Himself, appearing. We read here and we hear Him say--"My ears have you
   opened." The Lord Himself comes, even He who is all that these things
   foreshadowed!

   When He comes, He has a prepared ear. The margin has it, "My ears have
   you digged." Our ears often need digging, for they are blocked up by
   sin. The passage to the heart seems to be sealed in the case of fallen
   man. But when the Savior came, His ears were not as ours, but were
   attentive to the Divine voice. He says, "He wakens My ears to hear as
   they that are taught. The Lord God has opened My ears, and I was not
   rebellious." Our Lord was quick of understanding in the fear of the
   Lord. He knew what the will of the Lord was and He could say, "I do
   always the thing that pleases Him." As Man, He had a Divine instinct of
   holiness which made Him to know and love the Father's will--and caused
   Him always to translate that will into His own life.

   You see He came with opened ears and some think that we have here an
   allusion to the boring of the ear in the case of the servant who had a
   right to liberty, but refused to quit his servitude because he loved
   his master and wished to remain with him forever. It is not certain
   that there is any such reference, but it is certain that our Lord was
   bound forever to the service which He had undertaken for His
   Father--and that He would not go back from it. He pledged Himself to
   redeem us and He set His face like a flint to do it. He loved His
   Father and He loved His chosen so much that He vowed to execute

   the Father's work, even to what I might call, "the bitter end," if I
   did not know that it was a sweet and blessed end to Him. His ears were
   prepared for His service!

   But our Lord came also with a prepared body. Therefore the Apostle
   Paul, when He quoted this passage, probably taking the words from the
   Septuagint translation, writes, "A body have You prepared Me." You will
   wonder how, in one passage, it should speak of the ears and the next
   should speak of the body, and yet there is small difference in the
   sense. We do not think of an ear without a body--that would be a sorry
   business. The reading in the Hebrews is involved in the text as it
   stands in the Psalm. If the ear is there, a body is there--you cannot
   even dream of an ear hearing if separate from the rest of the body! The
   Apostle gives us the sense of the text rather than the words and, at
   the same time, dealing as He was with Jews by whom the Septuagint was
   prized, He quoted from the version which they would be sure to
   ac-knowledge--and very properly and wisely so--because that version was
   perfectly accurate as to the meaning of the Hebrew. Regardless, he was
   inspired to read it--"A body have You prepared Me." There was fashioned
   by the Holy Spirit, in the womb of the blessed Virgin, a body fit to
   embody the Son of God. Worked mysteriously, by means into which we must
   not inquire--for what God has veiled must remain covered--that body was
   suited to set forth the great mystery, "God manifest in the flesh."

   The whole body of Christ was prepared for Him and for His great work.
   To begin with, it was a sinless body, without taint of original sin,
   otherwise God could not have dwelt in it. It was a body made highly
   vital and sensitive, probably far beyond what ours are, for sin has a
   blunting and hardening effect even upon flesh, and His flesh, though it
   was in the "likeness of sinful flesh," was not sinful flesh, but flesh
   which yielded prompt obedience to His spirit, even as His whole human
   Nature was obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross. His body
   was capable of great endurance, so as to know the griefs and agonies
   and unspeakable sorrows of a delicate, holy and tender kind which it
   was necessary for Him to bear. "A body have You prepared Me." In the
   fullness of time He came into that body, which was admirably adapted to
   enshrine the Godhead. Wondrous mystery, that the Infant of Bethlehem
   should be linked with the Infinite! And that the weary Man by the
   shores of Galilee should be very God of very God, revealed in a body
   prepared for Him! "A body have You prepared Me"--He had prepared ears
   and a prepared body.

   He who assumed that body was existent before that body was prepared. He
   says, "A body have You prepared Me. Lo, I come." He from old eternity
   dwelt with God--the Word was in the beginning with God--and the Word
   was God. We could not, any one of us, have said that a body was
   prepared for us and, therefore, we would come to it, for we had had no
   existence before our bodies were fashioned! From everlasting to
   everlasting our Lord is God and He comes out of eternity into time--the
   Father bringing Him into the world. He was before all worlds and was
   before He came into the world to dwell in His prepared body!

   Beloved, the human Nature of Christ was taken on Him in order that He
   might be able to do for us that which God desired and required. God
   desired to see an obedient man, a man who would keep His Law to the
   fullest--and He sees Him in Christ. God desired to see One who would
   vindicate the eternal justice and show that sin is no trifle. And,
   behold, our Lord, the eternal Son of God, entering into that prepared
   body, was ready to do all this mighty work by rendering to the Law a
   full recompense for our dishonor of it! An absolutely perfect
   righteousness He renders unto God--as the second Adam, He presents it
   for all whom He represents. He bows His head, a victim beneath
   Jehovah's sword, that the Truth, justice and honor of God might suffer
   no detriment. His body was prepared to this end. Incarnation is a means
   to Atonement. Only a man could vindicate the Law and, therefore, the
   Son of God became a Man. This is a wonderful Being, this God in our
   nature. "Emmanuel" is a glorious word! Surely, for the Incarnation and
   the Atonement, the world was made from the first!

   Was this the reason why the morning stars sang together when they saw
   the cornerstone of the world, because they had an inkling that here,
   God would be manifest as nowhere else, and the Creator would be wedded
   to the creature? That God might be manifested in the Christ, it may
   even be that sin was permitted. Assuredly, there could have been no
   Sacrifice on Calvary if there had not, first of all, been sin in Eden.
   The whole scheme--the whole of God's decrees and acts-- worked up to an
   atoning Savior! Of the pyramid of creation and of Providence, Christ is
   the apex--He is the flower of all that God has made! His Divine Nature
   in strange union with humanity constitutes a peerless Person, such as
   never was before, and can never be again! God in our nature, one Being,
   and yet wearing two Natures, is altogether unique. He

   says, "A body have You prepared Me. Lo, I come." Think of this--it is a
   Truth of God more fit for meditation than for sermonizing. The Lord
   give us to know it well by faith!

   III. But now, thirdly, I call your attention to THE DECLARATION OF THE
   CHRIST made in the text--"Sacrifice and offering You did not desire.
   Then said I, Lo, I come." Observe when He says this. It is in the time
   of failure. All the sacrifices had failed. The candle flickered and was
   dying out. And then the great Light of God arose, even the Eternal
   Light and, like a trumpet, the words rung out, "Lo, I come." All this
   has been of no avail; now I come. It is in the time of failure that
   Christ always appears. The last of man is the first of God and when we
   have come to the end of all our power and hope, then the Eternal Power
   and Godhead appears with its, "Lo, I come."

   When our Lord comes, it is with the view of filling up the vacuum which
   had now been sorrowfully seen. God does not desire these things. God
   does not require these things, but He does desire and He does require
   something better, and lo, the Christ has come to bring that something!
   That awful gap which was seen in human hope when Moses had passed away
   and the Aaronic priesthood and all the ordinances of it were gone,
   Christ was born to fill! It looked as if the light of ages had been
   quenched, and God's glorious revelation had been forever withdrawn. And
   then, in the dark hour, Jesus cries, "Lo, I come!" He fills the blank
   abyss! He gives to man in reality what he had lost in the shadow!

   When He appears, it is as the personal Lord. Lay the stress upon the
   pronoun, "Lo, I come." The infinite Ego appears. "Lo, I come." No mere
   man could talk thus, and be sane! No servant or Prophet of God would
   ever say, "Lo, I come." Saintly men talk not so. God's Prophets and
   Apostles have a modest sense of their true position--they never magnify
   themselves, though they magnify their office. It is for God to say,
   "Lo, I come." He who says it takes the body prepared for Him and comes
   in His own proper personality as the I AM. "In Him dwells all the
   fullness of the Godhead bodily." He comes forth from the ivory palaces
   to inhabit the tents of manhood! He takes upon Himself the body
   prepared for Him of the Lord God and He stands forth in His matchless
   personality ready to do the will of God! "It pleased the Father that in
   Him should all fullness dwell." Everything is stored up in His blessed
   Person and we are complete in Him.

   Observe the joyful avowal that He makes--"Lo, I come." This is no
   dirge--I think I hear a silver trumpet ring out-- "Lo, I come." Here is
   a joyful alacrity and intense eagerness! The coming of the Savior was
   to Him a thing of exceeding willingness. "For the joy that was set
   before Him, He endured the Cross, despising the shame."

   He comes with a word calling attention to it, for He is not ashamed to
   be made partaker of our flesh. "Lo," He says, "I come. Behold, behold,
   I come." This is no clandestine union. He bids Heaven behold Him come
   into our Nature! Earth is bid to gaze upon it. O you sinners, listen to
   this inviting, "Lo!" Others have cried to you, "Lo, here!" And, "Lo,
   there." But Jesus looks on you and cries, "Lo, I come." Look here--turn
   all your thoughts this way and behold your God in your Nature ready to
   save you! Verily, the Incarnate God is a subject meet for the loftiest
   thoughts of sages and for the lowliest thoughts of children. Blessed
   are the children of Grace who can sit at the feet of the Incarnate God
   and look up, forgetting all the wisdom of the Greeks and all the
   sign-seeking of the Jews in the satisfaction which they find in Jesus!

   I think, too, I hear in this declaration of the coming One, a note of
   finality. He takes away the sacrifice from Aaron's altar, but He says,
   "Lo, I come." There is the end of it. "Lo, I come." Is there anything
   after this? Can anything supersede this--"Lo, I come"? "Lo, I come" has
   been the perpetual music of the ages! Read it, "Lo, I am come"--for it
   is in the present tense and how sweet the sound! Christ is come and joy
   with Him! Read it, as well, in the future, if you will, "Lo, I come,"
   for He comes "the second time without sin unto salvation"--here is our
   chief hope! "Lo, I come." He, Himself, is the last Word of God. "In the
   beginning was the Word" and so He was God's first Word. But He is the
   end as well as the beginning--God's last Word to man--Christ is God's
   ultimatum! Look for no new Revelation--"Lo, I am come," shines on
   forever. Do not ask, "Are You He that should come, or do we look for
   another?" He has come! Look for no other! Behold, He came to give what
   God desires, what God requires--what more would you have? Let Him be
   all your salvation and all your desire. Let Him be "the desire of all
   nations." He is the fulfillment of all the requirements of the human
   race as well as the full amount of what God requires.

   IV. Next, I beg you to note THE REFERENCE TO PRECEDING WRITINGS. He
   says, "Lo, I come: in the volume of the Book it is written of Me." If I
   preached from the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews, I might fairly
   declare that in the whole volume of Holy Scripture much is written of
   our Lord and prescribed for Him as Messiah. The pages of Inspiration
   are fragrant with the name of Jesus. He is the top line of the entire
   volume and in the Greek Word I see a half allusion to this. He is the
   headline of contents to every chapter of Scripture. He is, of all
   Scripture, the Sum. "In the begin-

   ning was the Word." Everything speaks of Him. The Pentateuch and the
   books of the Prophets, the Psalms, and the Gospels and the Epistles all
   speak of Him. "In the volume of the Book it is written of Me."

   Preaching as I am from the Psalms, I cannot take so long a range. I
   must look back and find what was written in David's day and certainly
   within the Pentateuch. And where do I find it written concerning His
   coming? The Pentateuch drips with prophecies of Christ as a honeycomb
   overflowing with its honey. Chiefly is He to be found in the head and
   front of the book--as early as the opening chapters of the Book of
   Genesis, when Adam and Eve had sinned and we were lost--behold, He is
   spoken of in the volume of the Book in these terms. "The Seed of the
   woman shall bruise the serpent's head." So, early was it written that
   the Redeemer would be born in our nature to vanquish our foe.

   But I confess I do not feel shut out from another interpretation. I
   conceive that our Lord, here, refers to another Book, the Book of the
   Divine purposes, the volume of the Eternal Covenant. There was a time
   before all time, when there was no day but the Ancient of Days--when
   all that existed was the Lord, who is All in All--then the sacred Three
   entered into Covenant, in mutual agreement, for a sublime end. Man
   sinning, the Son of God shall be the Surety. Christ shall bear the
   result of man's offense. He shall vindicate the Law of God and make
   Jehovah's name more glorious than ever it has been! The Second Person
   of the Divine Unity was pledged to come and take up the nature of men,
   and so become the First-Born among many Brothers and Sisters to lift up
   a fallen race, and to save a number that no man can number, elect of
   God the Father, and given to the Son to be His heritage, His portion,
   His bride.

   Then did the Well-Beloved strike hands with the Eternal God and enter
   into Covenant engagements on our behalf-- "In the volume of the Book it
   is written." That sealed Book, upon whose secrets no angel's eyes have
   looked, a Book written by the finger of God long before He wrote the
   Book of the Law upon tables of stone! That Book of God may be spoken of
   in the Psalm, "And in Your Book all My members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them." Our
   Lord came to carry out all His suretyship engagements--His work is the
   exact fulfillment of His engagements recorded in the Everlasting
   Covenant, "ordered in all things and sure." He acts out every
   mysterious line and syllable, even to the fullest. Then He said, "A
   body have You prepared Me. Lo, I come: in the volume of the Book it is
   written of Me." It is always a pleasing study to see our Lord, both in
   the written Word, and in the Everlasting Covenant of Grace.

   V. I must close with the fifth point, THE DELIGHT OF HIM THAT COMES. He
   said, "Lo, I come." As I have already told you, there is wonderful
   delight in that exclamation--"Lo, I come." But lest we should mistake
   our Lord, He adds, "I delight to do Your will, O My God: yes, Your Law
   is within My heart." There can be no denial of His joy in His service!

   Note well that He came in compete subservience to His Father, God. "I
   delight to do"--what? "Your will." His own will was absorbed in the
   Divine will! His pleasure it was to say, "Not as I will, but as You
   will." It was His meat and His drink to do the will of Him that sent
   Him and to finish His work. Though He was Lord and God, He became a
   lowly servant for our sakes! Though high as the highest, He stooped low
   as the lowest! The King of Kings was the Servant of Servants, that He
   might save His people! He took upon Him the form of a Servant, girded
   Himself and stood obediently at His Father's call.

   He had a prospective delight as to His work. Before He came, He
   delighted in the thought of His Incarnation. The Supreme Wisdom says,
   "My delights were with the sons of men." Happy in His Father's courts,
   He yet looked forward to an access of happiness in becoming Man. "Can
   that be?" asks one. Could the Son of God be happier than He was? As
   God, He was infinitely blessed, but He knew nothing by experience of
   the life of man--and into that sphere He desired to enter. To the
   Godhead there can be no enlargement, for it is infinite, but still,
   there can be an addition--our Lord was to add the nature of man to that
   of God! He would live as Man, suffer as Man, and triumph as Man--and
   yet remain God! And to this He looked forward with a strange delight,
   inexplicable except upon the knowledge of the great love He bore to us.
   He had given His heart so entirely to His dear bride, whom He saw in
   the glass of predestination, that for her He would endure all things--

   "Yes, says the Lord, for her I'll go Through all the depths of care and
   woe, And on the Cross will even dare The bitter pangs of death to
   bear."

   It was wondrous love! Our Lord's love surpasses all language and even
   thought. I am talking prodigies and miracles at every word I utter. It
   was delightful to our Lord to come here!

   "What did He delight in?" asks one. Evidently He delighted in God's
   Law. "Your Law is within My heart." He resolved that the beauties of
   the Law of the Lord should be displayed by being embodied in His own
   life and that its claims should be vindicated by His own death. To
   achieve this, He delighted to come and keep it and honor it by an
   obedience both active and passive. He also delighted in God's will and
   that is somewhat more, for law is the expression of will and this may
   be altered. But the will of the great King never changes. Our Lord
   delighted to carry out all the purposes and desires of the Most High
   God. He so delighted in the will of God that He came to do it and to
   bear it, "by which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
   body of Jesus Christ once for all."

   He delighted also in God. He took an intense delight in glorifying the
   Father. He came to reveal the Father and make Him to be beloved of men.
   He did all things to please God. Moreover, He took a delight in us and
   here, though the object of His love is less, the love, itself, is
   heightened by the conspicuous condescension. The Lord Jesus took a deep
   delight in His people, whose names were written on His heart and
   engraved on the palms of His hands. His heart was fixed on their
   redemption and, therefore, He would present Himself as a Sacrifice on
   their behalf. The people whom the Father gave Him from before the
   foundation of the world lay on His very soul--for them He had a baptism
   to be baptized with, and He was straitened till it was accomplished. He
   gave Himself no rest till He had left both joy and rest to ransom His
   own.

   May I go a step further and say that He had an actual delight in His
   coming among men? "I delight to do Your will, O My God"--not merely to
   think of doing it. When our Lord was here, He was the most blessed of
   men! Are you amazed? Do you remind me that He was "a Man of Sorrows"? I
   grant you that none was more afflicted, but I still stand to it, that
   within Him dwelt a joy of the highest order. To Him it was joy to be in
   sorrow--and honor to be put to shame. Do you think that lightens our
   estimate of His self-denial and disinterestedness? No, it adds weight
   to it! Some people fancy that there is no credit in doing a thing
   unless you are miserable in doing it. No, Brothers and Sisters, that is
   the very reverse! Obedience which is unwillingly offered and causes no
   joy in the soul is not acceptable. We must serve God with our heart, or
   we do not serve Him. Obedience rendered without delight in rendering it
   is only half obedience! You shall say what you will about the greatness
   of my Lord's agonies. You shall never go too far in your estimate of
   His unfathomable grief, but going with you to the fullest in it all, I
   shall still take liberty to say that He had within Himself a fountain
   of joy which enabled Him to endure the Cross and even to despise the
   shame! Blessed among men was He, even when He was made a curse for us!
   With delight He gave Himself for us and made a cheerful surrender of
   Himself, that He might be the Ransom for many. The text is express upon
   that fact.

   And all this because our Lord came with such intense heartiness. He
   says, "Yes, Your Law is within My heart." Our Lord is most thorough in
   all that He does. His work is never slovenly, nor in a half-hearted
   way. He does not even sit on the well and talk to a poor woman, but
   what His heart is there. He does not go into a fisherman's hut, but
   what His heart is there and He heals the sick one. He does not sit down
   to supper with His followers, but what His heart is there and He
   reveals His love. I wish we were always at home when the Lord calls for
   us! Sometimes we are all abroad and our heart is away from the service
   of our Father--but He loved the Lord with all His heart, mind and
   strength. For us He gave His whole being, rejoicing to redeem us! He
   was always intense. Whether He preached or practiced, Jesus was all
   there and always there. Hence His delight, for what a man does with his
   heart he delights to do. These two sentences are melodious ofjoy to my
   ears! "I delight to do Your will, O My God: yes, Your Law is within My
   heart."

   Hear this one other word. It is all done now. Jesus has fulfilled the
   Father's will in the salvation in the midst of His ransomed ones. And
   shall I tell you, need I tell you, what must be the delight, the
   heavenly Joy of our Lord, now that the work is finished? He is now the
   focus, the center, the source of bliss! What must be His own delight?
   We often say of the angels that they rejoice over one sinner that
   repents. I doubt not that they do, but the Bible does not say so. The
   Bible says, "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one
   sinner that repents." What does it mean, "the presence of the angels"?
   Why, that the angels see the joy of Christ when sinners repent! Hear
   them say to one another, "Behold the Father's face! How He rejoices!
   Gaze on the Countenance of the Son! What a Heaven of delight shines in
   those eyes of His! Jesus wept for these sinners, but now He rejoices
   over them! How resplendent are the nail-prints today, for the re-

   deemed of the Lord's death are believing and repenting! That blessed
   Countenance which is always as a sun, shines in the fullness of its
   strength now that He sees of the travail of His soul." He who suffered
   feels a joy unsearchable--

   "The first-born sons of light

   Desire in vain its depths to see:

   They cannot read the mystery--

   The length, the breadth, the height." Oh, the joy of triumphant love!
   The joy of the Crucified, whose prepared body is the body of His Glory
   as once it was the body of His humiliation! In that Manhood He still
   rejoices and delights to do the will of the Father.

   My time has fled and yet I am expected to say something about missions.
   What shall I say? My Brothers, Sisters--all of you--do you know
   anything about the Truths of God I have spoken? Then go and tell the
   heathen that the Lord is come! Here is a message worth the telling!
   Mary Magdalene and the other Marys hasten to tell the disciples that
   the Lord had risen--will you not go and tell them that He has come down
   to save? "Lo, I come," He says. Will you not take up His Words and go
   to the people who have never heard of Him and say, "Lo, He has come"?
   Tell the Ethiopians, the Chinese, the Hindus and all the islands of the
   sea, that God has come here to save men and has taken a prepared body,
   that He might give to God all He required and all that He desired, that
   sinful men might be accepted in the Beloved, with whom God the Father
   is well pleased!

   Go, and take to the heathen this sacred Book. "In the volume of the
   Book it is written of Him." Do not begin to doubt the Book, yourself.
   Why should you send missionaries to teach them about a Book in which
   you do not, yourself, believe? Tell the nations that, "In the volume of
   the Book it is written of Him." Believe this Book and spread it! Help
   Bible Societies and all such efforts. And aid Missionary Societies
   which carry the Book and proclaim the Savior! The men of the Book of
   God are the men of God such as the world needs. Bid such men go and
   open the Book of God and teach the nations its blessed news!

   Go, dear Friends, and assure the heathen that there is happiness in
   obedience to God. So the Savior found it. He delighted in God's will,
   even to the death! And they will also know delight, as in their
   measures they bow before the authority of the Word and the will of the
   one living and true God, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob.
   Jehovah, the I AM, must be worshipped, for beside Him there is none
   else. Give glory unto God, whom our Lord Jesus has come to glorify.
   Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Psalm 40.

"Lo, I Come"--Application

   (No. 2203)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, MAY 3, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then said I, Lo, I come." Psalm 40:7.

   To my great sorrow, last Sunday night I was unable to preach. I had
   prepared a sermon upon this text with much hope of its usefulness, for
   I intended it to be a supplement to the morning sermon [Sermon #2202,
   "Lo, I Come"-- Exposition"] which was a doctrinal exposition. The
   evening sermon was intended to be practical and to commend the whole
   subject to the attention of enquiring sinners. I came here feeling
   quite fit to preach, but an overpowering nervousness oppressed me and I
   lost all self-control--and left the pulpit in anguish. I come here this
   morning with the same subject. I have been turning it over and
   wondering why it was so. Perhaps this sermon was not to be preached on
   that occasion because God would teach the preacher more of his on
   feebleness and cast him more fully upon the Divine Strength. That has
   certainly been the effect upon my own heart.

   Perhaps, also, there are some here, this morning, who were not here
   last Lord's-Day evening, whom God intends to bless by the sermon. The
   people were not here, perhaps, for whom the eternal decree of God had
   designed the message and they may be here now. You that are new to this
   place should consider the strange circumstance--which never happened to
   me before in the 40 years of my ministry--and you may be led to enquire
   whether my bow was then unstrung that the arrow might find its ordained
   target in your heart! The two sermons will now go forth together from
   the press and, perhaps, going together, they may prove to be like two
   hands of love with which to embrace lost souls and draw them to the
   Savior, who herein says, "Lo, I come." God grant it may be so!

   The times when our Lord says, "Lo, I come," have all a family likeness.
   There are certain crystals which assume a regular shape and, if you
   break them, each fragment will show the same conformation. If you were
   to dash them to shivers, every particle of the crystal would still be
   of the same form. Now, the goings forth of Christ which were of old,
   His coming at Calvary and that great Advent when He shall come a second
   time to judge the earth in righteousness--all these have a likeness,
   the one to the other. But there is a coming of what I may call a lesser
   sort, when Jesus cries, "Lo, I come," to each individual sinner and
   brings a revelation of pardon and salvation--and this has about it much
   which is similar to the great ones. My one desire this morning is to
   set forth the Lord Jesus as saying to you, as once He did to me, "Lo, I
   come."

   He still cries to the weak, destitute, forlorn, hopeless sinner, "Lo, I
   come." I shall talk about that coming and hope that you will experience
   it, now, and thus be able to follow me in what I say. I speak mainly to
   the unconverted, but while I do so, I shall hope to be refreshing the
   grateful memories of those already saved--but this will all depend upon
   the working of the Spirit of God. To Him, then, lift up your hearts in
   prayer.

   I. I will commence with this observation--THE LORD CHRIST HAS TIMES OF
   HIS FIRST COMINGS TO MEN--"Then said I, Lo, I come."

   What are these times? Maybe some here present have reached this season
   and this very day is the time of blessing when the text shall be
   fulfilled--"Then said I, Lo, I come." Go with me to the first record in
   the volume of the Book, when it was said that He should come. You will
   find it in the early chapters of Genesis.

   Jesus said, "Lo, I come," when man's probation was a failure. Man in
   the Garden of Eden had every advantage for obedience and life. He had a
   perfect nature, created without bias towards evil and he was surrounded
   with every inducement to continue loyal to his Maker. He was placed
   under no burdensome law. The precept was simple and plain--"Of every
   tree of the garden you may freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge
   of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for

   in the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die." Only one tree
   was reserved--all the rest were given up to be freely enjoyed. In a
   very short time--some think it was on the first day, but that we do not
   know--our mother Eve ate of the fruit and father Adam followed her, and
   thus human probation ended in total failure. They were weighed in the
   balances and found wanting--"Adam, being in honor, continued not." At
   that point we read in the volume of the Book that the Seed of the woman
   should bruise the serpent's head. Then our Redeemer said, "Lo, I come."

   Listen to me, my Friend--you, also, have had your probation, as you
   have thought it to be. You left your father's roof with every hope.
   Your mother judged you to be of a most amiable character and your
   friends expected to see in you one whose life would honor the family.
   You thought so yourself. Your probation has reversed that hope--you
   have turned out far different then you should have and, looking back
   upon the whole of your life to this moment, you ought to be ashamed! It
   has been a terrible breaking down for you and for all who know you--and
   you are sitting in this place feeling, "Yes, it is so. The tests have
   proven me to be as a broken reed. I am under condemnation by reason of
   my transgressions against God." How rejoiced I am to tell you that, at
   such a time when you are conscious that you are a dead failure, Jesus
   says, "Lo, I come!" If you had not been a failure, you would not have
   needed Him and He never comes as a superfluity. But now, in your
   complete breakdown, you must have Him or perish--and in infinite pity
   he cries, "Lo, I come!" Is not this good news for you? Believe it and
   live!

   That also was a time when man's clever dealings with the devil had
   turned out a great failure. The serpent came and said, "God knows that
   in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you
   shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." How craftily he put it! How
   cunningly he insinuated that God was jealous of what man might become
   and was keeping him back from a nobler destiny! He even dared to say,
   "You shall not surely die," thus giving the Lord the lie direct! He
   seemed to say--"His threat is a mere bugbear, a thing to scare you from
   a great advance in knowledge and position! You shall not surely die."
   Eve, in her supposed wisdom, was not able to cope with the serpent's
   subtlety. "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
   that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
   wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
   her husband with her; and he did eat." The devil had played his cards
   so well that man was left bankrupt of virtue, bankrupt of happiness,
   bankrupt of hope! Then, in the volume of the Book, it was written, "I
   said, Lo, I come." Yes, in the exact hour when hellish falsehood had
   robbed man of everything!

   No man has yet dealt with the devil without being a loser. The
   arch-deceiver promises very fairly, but he lies from beginning to end.
   I know he promised you pleasure unbounded and liberty unrestrained. Now
   the pleasure is burnt out and the ashes of that which once blazed and
   crackled are terrible to look upon! As for liberty, where is it? You
   have become the bond-slave of sin. You were to enjoy life and lo, you
   are plunged in death! It may be there are in this house persons who
   bear in their bodies the marks, not of the Lord Jesus, but of the
   devil's temptations. He has made you to sin so that your bones are
   filled with the sins of your youth--and you know it. He needs a long
   spoon who eats out of the same dish as the devil and your spoon has not
   been long enough! Sin has overreached and betrayed you. And you stand
   trembling before God as the result of having listened to the falsehoods
   of Hell and having rejected the commands of Heaven

   Supposing such a person to be present--and I feel sure he is--I pray
   that he may hear my text as from the Lord Jesus, Himself. "Then said I,
   Lo, I come." The devil has trod you down, but Jesus comes to raise you
   up! Your paradise is lost, but by Him it is to be restored! Jesus has
   come to give repentance and remission of sins. That crafty head which
   deceived you--the Lord Jesus has broken--He came for this purpose. If
   you had not been betrayed, you would not have needed a Deliverer, but
   your misery has made room for His mercy. Not while Adam is perfect in
   Paradise is there any news of the Seed of the woman bruising the
   serpent's head. But after the serpent has done his deceitful work and
   has ruined the race, then we hear that ancient Gospel of God and see
   the only hope of fallen man! Here is good cheer for you who look with
   shame upon your foolish yielding to Satan's deceits! You are caught as
   silly birds in a snare! You have been as foolish as the fish of the sea
   which are taken in a net, but when you are captives, Christ comes to be
   your Liberator and God commends His love towards you in that while you
   are yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly!

   Further than this, when we find the first promise of our Lord's coming,
   "in the volume of the Book," we find that man's covering was a failure.
   The guilty pair had gathered the leaves of the fig tree and had made
   themselves aprons, for they knew that they were naked. This was the
   first fruit of that boasted Tree of Knowledge and it is the principal
   one to this day! Their scant coverlet contented them for a little
   while, but when the voice of the Lord God was heard in the Gar-

   den, they confessed that their aprons were good for nothing, for Adam
   acknowledged that he was afraid because he was naked and, therefore, he
   had hidden himself in the thick groves of the Garden. It is easy to
   make a covering which pleases us for a season, but self-righteousness,
   presumption, pretended infidelity and fancied natural excellence--all
   those things are like green fig leaves which shrivel up before long,
   lose their freshness--and are rather an exposure than a covering.

   It may be that my hearer has found his imaginary virtues failing him.
   It was when our first parents knew that they were naked that the Savior
   said, "Lo, I come." My downcast Hearer, if you are no longer in your
   own esteem, as good as you used to be. If you can no longer hide the
   fact that you have broken God's Law and deserve His wrath. If you no
   longer believe the devil's lie that you shall suffer no penalty, but
   may even be the better for sin, then our Lord, the Savior, says to you,
   "Lo, I come." To you, O naked Sinner, shivering in your own shame,
   blushing scarlet with conviction-- to you He comes! When you have
   nothing left of your own, He comes to be your robe of righteousness
   wherein you may stand accepted with God!

   That first news of the coming Champion came at a time when all man's
   pleas were failures. Adam had thrown the blame on Eve--"The woman whom
   You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat." Eve
   had also thrown the blame on the serpent, but the Lord God had silenced
   all such excuses and driven them from their refuges. He had made them
   feel their guilt and had pronounced upon them the inevitable
   sentence--and then it was that He spoke of the "Seed of the woman."
   Here was man's first and last--and best hope! So too, my Friend, when
   you dare no longer plead your innocence, nor mention extenuations and
   excuses, then Jesus comes in! If conscience oppresses you so sorely
   that you cannot escape from it. If it is so that all you can say is
   "Guilty! Willfully Guilty," then Jesus comes! If you neither blame your
   surroundings, nor your companions, nor the Providence of God, nor your
   physical weakness, nor anything else, but just take all the blame to
   yourself because you cannot help doing so--then Jesus comes in! Verily
   you have sinned against God, against your parents, against your fellow
   men, against the Light of God, against knowledge, against conscience
   and against the Holy Spirit! No wonder, therefore, that you stand
   speechless, unable to offer any plea by way of self-justification! It
   is in that moment of shame and confusion that the Savior says, "Lo, I
   come," for such as you are He is an Advocate! When a sinner cannot
   plead for himself, Christ pleads for him! When his excuses have come to
   an end, then will the Lord put away his sin through His own great
   Sacrifice. Is not this a precious Gospel Word?

   When our Lord did actually arrive, fulfilling the text by being born of
   a woman, it was when man's religion had proven a failure. Sacrifices
   and offerings had ceased to be of any value--God had put them away as a
   weariness to Him. The scribes and the Pharisees, with all their
   phylacteries and wide-bordered garments, were a mere sham. There seemed
   to be no true religion left upon the earth. Then said Christ, "Lo, I
   come!" There was never a darker 30 years than when Herod slew the
   innocents and the chief priests and scribes pursued the Son of God and,
   at last, nailed Him to the tree. It was then that Jesus came to us to
   redeem us by His death! Do I speak to any man here whose religion has
   broken down? You have observed a host of rites and ceremonies--you were
   christened in your infancy, you were duly confirmed, you have taken
   what you call, "the blessed sacrament." Or it may be you have always
   sat in the most plain of Meeting Houses and listened to the most
   orthodox of preachers--and you have been among the most religious of
   religious people--but now, at last, the Spirit of God has shown you
   that all these performances and attendances are worthless cobwebs which
   avail you nothing! You now see that--

   "Not all the outward forms on earth,

   Nor rites that God has given,

   Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth,

   Can raise a soul to Heaven."

   You are just now driven to despair because the palace of your imaginary
   excellence has vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision. If I had
   told you that your religiousness was of no value, you would have been
   very angry with me and, perhaps, you would have said, "That is a
   bigoted remark and you ought to be ashamed of yourself for making it!"
   But now the Spirit of God has told you the same and you feel its
   force--He is great at convincing of sin! When the Spirit of Truth comes
   to deal with the religiousness of the flesh, He withers it in a moment!
   All religion which is not spiritual is worthless. All religion which is
   not the supernatural product of the Holy Spirit is a fiction. One
   breath from the Spirit of God withers all the beauty of our pride and
   destroys the comeliness of our conceit and then, when our own religion
   is dashed to shivers, the Lord Jesus comes in, saying, "Lo, I come." He
   delights to come in His glorious Personality when the Pharisee can no
   longer say, "God, I thank You that I am not as other men" and when the
   once bold fisherman is cry-

   ing, "Lord, save, or I perish." If you feel that you need something
   infinitely better than Churchianity, or Dissenterism, or Methodism--in
   fact, that you need Christ, Himself, to be formed in you--then to you,
   even to you, Jesus says, "Lo, I come." When man is at his worst, Christ
   is seen at His best. The Lord walks to us on the sea in the middle
   watch of the night. He draws near to those souls which draw near to
   death. When you part with self, you meet with Christ. When no shred of
   hope remains, then Jesus says, "Lo, I come."

   Once more. The Lord Jesus is to come a second time and when will He
   come? He will come when man's hope is a failure. He will come when
   iniquity abounds and the love of many has waxed cold. He will come when
   dreams of a golden age shall be turned into the dread reality of
   abounding evil. Do not dream that the world will go on improving and
   improv-ing--and that the improvement will naturally culminate in the
   millennium. No such thing! It may grow better for a while--better under
   certain aspects--but, afterwards, the power of the better element will
   ebb out like the sea, even though each wave should look like an
   advance. That day shall not come except there is a falling away first.
   Even the wise virgins will sleep and the men of the world will be, as
   in the days of Noah, eating and drinking, marrying and being given in
   marriage.

   And then, all of a sudden, the Lord will come as a thief in the night!
   The deluge of fire will find men as unprepared as did the deluge of
   water! He will come taking vengeance on His adversaries. When things
   wax worse and worse we see the tokens of His speedy coming. He will
   shortly appear, for the sky is darkening. When every hope will seem
   blotted out and nothing but grim ages of anarchy and ungodliness are to
   be expected, then our Deliverer will come! When the count of bricks was
   doubled in Egypt, Moses came. And when the world attains to its utmost
   unbelief and iniquity, Jesus will come. So at this moment my Hearer may
   be saying, "I cannot be worse than I am; if I am not actually already
   in Hell, yet I feel a fire within which tortures my soul! The sword of
   vengeance hangs over my head suspended by a single hair! I tremble to
   live and I fear to die. Lost! Lost! Lost! I am past hope!" This is the
   time for my text--"Then said I, Lo, I come." He who is able to save to
   the uttermost appears to the soul when every other hope disappears. In
   your deep distress, I see a token for good! You are now reduced to
   spiritual death and now, I trust, the Eternal Life will visit you!

   Now all this I put before you in simple language, believing what I say,
   and trusting that if I describe your case, you will know that I mean it
   for you. I have heard of a preacher who was so fearful lest he should
   be thought personal, that he said to his congregation, "Lest any of you
   should think that what I have said was meant for you, I would observe
   that the sermon I am preaching was prepared for a congregation in
   Massachusetts." I can plead nothing of the sort! I refer to you, my
   Hearer, in the most pointed manner! I will attend to Massachusetts, if
   ever the Lord sends me there, but just now, I mean YOU. Oh, that you
   may have Grace to take home these thoughts to yourselves, for if you
   do, they will, by the Spirit's power, bring the light of hope into your
   souls!

   II. Secondly, I would remark that CHRIST COMES TO SINNERS IN THE GLORY
   OF HIS PERSON--"Then said I, Lo, I come." Note that glorious, I! Have
   you not seen people engaged in urgent work who did not understand their
   business? Apprentices and other unskilled people are muddling time
   away. They are making bad, worse, and running great risk. Perhaps a
   great calamity will occur if the work is not done well and quickly. A
   first-rate worker is sent for. See, the man has come who understands
   the business. He cries, "Let me come! Stand out of my way! You are on
   the wrong tack--let me do it myself!" You have not blamed him for
   egotism, for the thing needed to be done and he could do it--and the
   others could not. Everybody recognized the master workman and gave
   place to him. The announcement of his coming was the end of the muddle
   and the signal of hope! Even so, Jesus comes to you sinners and His
   Presence is your salvation! He says, "Lo, I come." What does He mean?

   He means, the setting of all else on one side. There is the priest--he
   has not helped you much. He may go, for Jesus says, "Lo, I come." There
   are your own efforts and doings. There are your feelings and thoughts.
   There are your ceremonies and austerities. There are your prayers and
   tears. There are your hearings and readings--all these must be laid
   aside as grounds of confidence--and Jesus, alone, must be your trust.
   He can do for you what none of these can. You are trying to work
   yourself up to repentance and faith, but you cannot succeed. Let Him
   come and He will bring every good thing with Him. It is glorious to see
   our Lord throwing down all our bowing walls and tottering fences and to
   hear Him cry, "Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation." Everything else
   vanishes before His perfect salvation!

   Before Him there is a setting aside of self. You have been your own
   confidence. What you could feel, or do, or think, or resolve, had
   become the ground of your confidence, but now Jesus puts self down and
   He is, Himself, exalted. By

   working yourself to death, you cannot effect our own salvation. Lo,
   Jesus comes to save you! You cannot weave yourself a garment. Lo, He
   comes to clothe you from head to foot with His own seamless robe of
   righteousness! He annihilates self that He may fill all things.

   Here is a glorious setting of Himself at our side and in our place. Mr.
   Moody tells a story which I would gladly hope may be true, for one
   would like to hear something good about a Czar of Russia, and
   especially about our once enemy, the Emperor Nicholas. The story
   concerns a soldier in the barracks who was much distressed by his heavy
   debts. He was in despair, for he owed a great deal of money and could
   not tell where to get it. He took a piece of paper and made a list of
   his debts and underneath the list he wrote, "Who will pay these debts?"
   He then lay down on his bunk and fell asleep, with the paper before
   him. The Emperor of Russia passed by and, taking up the paper, read it,
   and being in a gracious mood, signed at the bottom, "Nicholas." Was not
   that a splendid answer to the question? When the soldier woke up and
   read it, he could scarcely believe his own eyes. "Who will pay these
   debts?" was the despairing question. "Nicholas," was the all-sufficient
   answer! So are we answered! Who will bear our sins? The grand reply is,
   "JESUS." He puts His own name to our liabilities and, in effect, that
   He may meet them, He says, "Lo, I come."

   Your debt of sin is discharged when you believe in Christ Jesus.
   "Without shedding of blood is no remission," but the blood of Jesus
   Christ, God's dear Son, cleanses us from all sin! You are not now to
   bear your own sins. Behold the Scapegoat, who carries them away into
   the wilderness! Yes, Jesus says, "Lo, I come!" He takes our sins upon
   Himself. He bears their penalty and we go free! Blessed words--"Lo, I
   come"--I come to take your weight of sin, your burden of punishment! I
   come to be made a curse for you, that you may be made the righteousness
   of God in Me. Sinner, stand out of the way and let Jesus appear for you
   and fill your place! He sets you on one side and then He sets Himself
   where you have been! Jesus is now the one Pillar on which to lean, the
   one Foundation on which to build, the one and only Rest for our weary
   souls!

   He sets Himself where we can see Him, for He cries, "Lo, I come." That
   is to say, "See Me come." He comes openly, that we may see Him clearly.
   How I wish the Lord would reveal Himself at this moment to each one of
   those who are weary of earth, of self, of sin and, possibly, even weary
   of life, itself! Oh, if you could but see Jesus standing in your place,
   you would have faith to stand in His place and so become, "accepted in
   the Beloved"! O Lord, hear my prayer, and cause poor hearts to see You
   descending from the skies, to uplift sinners from the dark abyss! Holy
   Spirit, touch that young man's eyes with heavenly salve, that he may
   see where salvation lies. Deal with that poor woman's dim eyes, also,
   that she may perceive the Lord Christ and find peace in Him. Jesus
   cries, "Lo, I come! Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the
   earth"--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One!

   There is life at this moment for thee.

   Then look, sinner--look unto Him and be sa ved--

   Unto Him who was nailed to the tree." Should you even lie in all the
   despair and desolation which I described, I would persuade you to
   believe in Jesus! Trust Him and you shall find Him all that you need!

   Our lord sets Himself to be permanently our All in All. When He came on
   earth, He did not leave His work till He had finished it. Even when He
   rose to Glory, He continued His service for His chosen, living to
   intercede for them. Jesus was a Savior 1,900 years ago and He is still
   a Savior--and He will be a Savior until all the chosen race shall have
   been gathered Home. He tells us, "I said, Lo, I come," but He does not
   say, "I said, I will go away, and quit the work." Our Lord's ear is
   bored and He goes out no more from the service of salvation. It is not
   written of any penitent souls, "You shall seek Me, but shall not find
   Me." But it is written, "If you seek Him, He will be found of you." O
   my Hearer, you are now in the place where the Gospel is preached to
   you--yes, to you, for we are sent to preach the Gospel to every
   creature! And though you should be the worst, most benighted and most
   guilty of all the creatures out of Hell, yet you are a creature, and we
   preach Christ to you!

   O poor Heart, may the Lord Jesus say to you "Lo, I come!" for He comes
   to stay--to stay until He has worked salvation in you as He has worked
   out salvation for you. He will not leave a Believer till He has
   presented him spotless before the Throne of God with exceeding joy. I
   wish I could make all this most clear and plain. You are altogether
   ruined by your own fault and you cannot undo the evil. You have done
   all you can and it has come to nothing. You are steeped in sin up to
   your throat--yes, the filth has gone over your head--you are as one
   drowned in black waters. Despairing one,

   cast not your eyes around to seek for a friend, for you will look in
   vain to men! No arm can rescue you, save one, and that is the arm of
   Jesus who now cries, "Lo, I come!" Set everything else on one side and
   trust yourself with the Savior, Christ the Lord!

   III. Oh, that many may be comforted while I dwell on the third head!
   CHRIST IN HIS COMING IS HIS OWN INTRODUCTION. Here our Lord is His own
   herald, "Lo, I come." He does not wait for an eloquent preacher to act
   as master of ceremonies for Him--He introduces Himself. Therefore even
   I, the simplest talker on earth, may prove quite sufficient for my
   Lord's purpose if He will graciously condescend to bless these plain
   words of mine. It is not I that say that Jesus comes, but in the text
   our Lord, Himself, declares, "Then said I, Lo, I come." You need not do
   anything to draw Christ's attention to you--it is Christ who draws your
   attention to Himself! Do you see this? You are the blind bat and He is
   all eyes towards you and bids you look on Him. I hear you cry, "Lord,
   remember me," and I hear Him answer, "Soul, remember Me." He bids you
   look on Him when you beseech Him to look on you!

   He comes when quite unsought, or sought for in a wrong way. To many men
   and women, Christ has come though they had not even desired Him. Yes,
   He has come even to those who hated Him. Saul of Tarsus was on His way
   to worry the saints at Damascus, but Jesus said, "Lo, I come"--and when
   He looked out of Heaven, He turned Saul, the persecutor, into Paul, the
   Apostle! The promise is fulfilled, "I was found of them that sought Me
   not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me." Herein is
   the glorious sovereignty of His love fully exercised and Grace reigning
   supreme. "Lo, I come," is the announcement of majestic Grace which
   waits not for man, neither tarries for the sons of men.

   Our Lord Jesus is the way to Himself. Did you ever notice that? He
   Himself comes to us and so He is the way by which we meet Him. He is
   our rest and the way to our rest. He says, "I am the way." You want to
   know how to get to Christ? You have not to get to Christ, for He has
   come to you! It is well for you to come to Christ, but that is only
   possible because Christ has come to you! Jesus is near you--near you
   now. Backslider, He comes to you! Wandering Soul, roving to the very
   brink of perdition, the good Shepherd cries, "Lo, I come." He is the
   way to Himself!

   Remember, also, that He is the blessing which He brings. Jesus not only
   gives life and resurrection, but He says, "I am the Resurrection and
   the Life." Christ is Salvation and everything necessary to salvation is
   in Him. If He comes, all good comes with Him, or rather, in Him. An
   enquirer once said to a minister, "The next step for me is to get a
   deeper conviction of sin." The minister said, "No such thing, my
   Friend--the next step is to trust in Jesus, for He says, Come unto Me."
   To come to Jesus, or rather to receive Jesus who has come to us, is the
   one essential step into eternal salvation. Though our Lord says, "Come
   unto Me," He has preceded it with this other word, "Lo, I come." Poor
   cripple, if you cannot come to Jesus, ask Him to come to you and He
   will! Here you lie and you have been for years in this case--you have
   no man to put you into the pool and it would do you no good if he
   did--but Jesus can make you whole and He is here! You cannot stir hand
   or foot because of spiritual paralysis, but your case is not hopeless.
   Listen to my Lord in the text, "Then said I, Lo, I come." He has no
   paralysis! He can come, leaping over the mountains of division! I know
   my Lord came to me, or I should never have come to Him--why should He
   not come to you? I came to Him because He came to me--

   "He drew me, and I followed on, Charmed to confess the voice Divine."

   Why should He not draw you, also? Is He not doing so? Yield to the
   pressure of His love!

   "Then said I, Lo, I come." You see our Lord is His own spokesman. He
   says to me, "Go and tell those people about My coming"--and I gladly do
   so--but you will forget my words and refuse to accept the Coming One.
   Your consciences will be unawakened, your hearts unmoved--I fear it
   will be so. But if this text is fulfilled concerning our Lord this
   day--"Then said I, Lo, I come"--you will hear HIM! If He speaks, He is,
   Himself, the Almighty Word, and His voice will reach your hearts and
   accomplish His purpose! Dear Christian people, join with me in this
   prayer--Lord, speak to Your chosen ones that lie here in their
   death-like despair, far off from You, and say to each one of them, "Lo,
   I come." O downcast Soul, this is your morning--this is the set time to
   favor you--this day is salvation come to your house and to your heart!
   Make haste and come down from the tree of your frivolity or your
   self-righteousness! Receive the Lord Jesus, for today He must abide in
   your house and in your heart--the hour for the imperial "must" of the
   eternal purpose has arrived! God grant it may be so! May this be an
   hour of which Jesus shall declare--"Then said I, Lo, I come!"

   IV. Our next point is this--CHRIST, TO CHEER US, REVEALS HIS REASONS
   FOR COMING. Only a few

   words on this. Note the rest of the verse--"Lo, I come: in the volume
   of the Book it is written of Me." When we were yet without strength, in
   due time, Christ died for the ungodly because it was the due time
   according to Covenant purposes. Christ comes to a guilty sinner just as
   He once came to a manger and a stable, because so it was appointed.
   There is nothing for Him to get, but everything for Him to give. He
   comes because so it is written in the volume of the Divine Decrees--

   "Thus the eternal counsel ran-- Almighty Grace, arrest that man!"
   Therefore in love the Savior appears to the sinner and, by Divine
   Grace, arrests him in his mad career.

   It is His Father's will. Christ's coming to save a soul is with His
   Father's full consent and aid. The Father wills that you who believe in
   Him, lost though you are, should now be saved--and Jesus comes to do
   the will of the Father.

   He comes because His heart is set on you. He loves you and so He
   hastens to your rescue. Your salvation is His delight. Though your soul
   is sunk in a sea of need and you are in despair because of that need,
   Jesus loves you, and comes to meet your case. The best of all is that
   Jesus loves you. One asked an old man of 90, "Do you love Jesus?" and
   the old man answered with a smile, "I do, indeed. But I can tell you
   something better than that." His friend asked, "Something better than
   loving Jesus! What is that?" The old disciple replied, "He loves me." O
   Soul, I wish you could see this fact which is, indeed, better than your
   love to Jesus, namely, His love to you! Because He loved His redeemed
   from before the foundation of the world, therefore, in due time, He
   says, "Lo, I come."

   The fact is, you have need and He has love--and so He comes. There is
   no hope for you unless He comes and that is why He comes! If you had a
   penny of your own, He would not give you His purse. If you had a rag of
   your own, He would not give you His robe. If you had a breath of your
   own, He would not give you His life! But now that you are naked, poor,
   miserable, lost and dead, Jesus reveals Himself and you read concerning
   Him, "Then said I, Lo, I come." He gives you His reasons--reasons not
   in yourself, but all in His Grace. There is no good in you--there is no
   reason in you why the Lord should save you--but because of His free,
   spontaneous, rich, sovereign, almighty Grace, He leaps out of Heaven,
   He descends to earth, He plunges into the grave to pluck His Beloved
   from destruction!

   V. Here is my last word--CHRIST'S COMING IS THE BEST PLEA FOR OUR
   RECEIVING HIM--and receiving Him now! O Sirs, remember you have not to
   raise the question whether He will come or not. He is come! You have
   not to say, How can I come to Him? He comes to you! You need a Mediator
   between your soul and God, but you do not need any mediator between
   yourself and Jesus, for He says, "Lo, I come." To you in all your
   filthiness, in all your condemnation, in all your hopelessness, He
   comes! Wait not for anybody to introduce you to Him, or Him to you--He
   has introduced Himself and here is His card--"Then said I, Lo, I come."
   No pleas are needed to persuade Him to come to you, for He says, "Lo, I
   come." Though you cannot think of a single argument why He should
   appear to you in mercy, He does so! It is written, "I will have mercy
   upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were
   not My people, You are My people; and they shall say, You are my God."
   O Words of wondrous Grace! Our gracious Lord does not wait for our
   entreaties; but of His own accord He says, "Lo, I come." Without asking
   you and without your asking Him, He puts in an appearance in the
   sovereignty of His Grace.

   No search is needed to find the Lord, for He comes in manifested Grace
   and calls upon us to see Him. "I have long been searching for Christ"
   murmurs one. What? Seeking for the sun at noonday? Jesus is not lost!
   It is you that are lost and He is searching for you! He says, "Lo, I
   come"--it is you that will not come. Still one declares that he has
   been seeking the Lord Jesus for many a day. This is sadly strange, for
   Jesus is near. "Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven?
   or, Who shall descend into the deep? The Word is near you, even in your
   mouth, and in your heart, that if you will confess with your mouth the
   Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him
   from the dead, you shall be saved." If you believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, you shall be saved! Searching after Christ? No, verily He says,
   "Lo, I come."

   Moreover, no waiting is needed and no preparation is to be made by you.
   Why do you wait? HE does not wait, but cries, "Lo, I come!" "I will get
   ready for Christ," you say, but it is too late to talk so, when He
   cries, "Lo, I am come." Receive Him! If you are, in yourself, sadly
   unready, yet He, Himself, will make everything ready for Himself. Only
   open wide the door and let Him in. Do you say, "But I am ashamed"? Be
   ashamed! He bids you be ashamed and be con-

   founded, while He declares, "I do not this for your sakes." Yet be not
   so ashamed as to commit another shameful deed by shutting the door in
   your Redeemer's face! Shut not out your own mercy!

   A pastor in Edinburgh, in going round his district, knocked at the door
   of a poor woman for whom he had brought some needed help, but he
   received no answer. When next he met her, he said to her, "I called on
   Tuesday at your house." She asked, "At what time?" "About eleven
   o'clock. I knocked, and you did not answer. I was disappointed, for I
   called to give you help." "Ah, Sir!" she said, "I am very sorry. I
   thought it was the man coming for the rent and I could not pay it and,
   therefore, I did not dare to go to the door." Many a troubled soul
   thinks that Jesus is One who comes to ask of us what we cannot give,
   but, indeed, He comes to give us all things. His errand is not to
   condemn, but to forgive. Miss not the charity of God through unbelief!
   Run to the door and say to your loving Redeemer, "Lord, I am not worthy
   that You should come under my roof, but as You have come to me, I
   welcome You with all my heart."

   No assistance is needed by Christ on your part. He does not come with
   half a salvation and look to you to complete it. He does not come to
   bring you a robe, half woven, which you are to finish. How could you
   finish it? Could the best saint in the world add anything to Christ's
   righteousness? No good man would even dream of adding his home-spun to
   that raiment which is of worked gold! What? Are you to make up the
   deficient ransom price? Is it deficient? Would you bring your clods of
   mud into the royal treasury and lay them down, side by side with
   sapphires? Would you help Christ? Go, yoke a mouse with an elephant! Go
   harness a fly side by side with an archangel! But dream not of yoking
   yourself with Christ. He says, "Lo, I come," and I trust you will
   reply, "My Lord, if You are come, all is come, and I am complete in
   You"--

   "You, O Christ are all I need, More than all in You I find."

   Receive Him--receive Him at once! Dear children of God and sinners that
   have begun to feel after Him, say with one accord, "Even so, come
   quickly, Lord Jesus." If He says, "Lo, I come," and the Spirit and the
   bride say, Come, and he that hears says, Come, and he that is thirsty
   comes, and whoever will is bidden to come and take the Water of Life
   freely--then let us join the chorus of comes, and come to Christ
   ourselves! "Behold, the Bridegroom comes; go you out to meet Him!" You
   who most of all need Him, be among the first and most glad, as you hear
   Him say, "Lo, I come!"

   All that I have said will be good for nothing as to saving results
   unless the Holy Spirit shall apply it with power to your hearts. Join
   with me in prayer that many may see Jesus, just now, and may at once
   behold and accept the present salvation which is in Him.

Sin--Its Springhead, Stream and Sea

   (No. 2204)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 10, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Our fathers understood not Your wonders in Egypt; they remembered not
   the multitude of Your mercies; but provoked Him at the sea, even at the
   Red Sea." Psalm 106:7.

   OUR fathers! From them we derive our nature. We inherit our fathers'
   propensities, for that which is born of the flesh is flesh. As is the
   nature, such is the conduct. Hence the Psalmist writes in verse 6, "We
   have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done
   wickedly." If we must mention our fathers' faults, it is not to screen
   ourselves, for we have to confess that our life's story is no brighter
   than theirs. It is not because the fathers have eaten sour grapes that
   the children's teeth are set on edge, for we, ourselves, have greedily
   devoured those evil clusters--"We have sinned with our fathers." "As in
   water, face answers to face, so the heart of man to man." When we read
   of the sins of others, we ought to be humbled and warned, for, "all we,
   like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned, everyone, to his own
   way." We have no space wherein to set up a monument to our own glory.
   As we cannot boast in our pedigree, for we are the children of sinners,
   so we cannot exalt ourselves because of our personal excellence, for
   there is none that does good, no not one. We come before God and
   confess our iniquities as a race and as individuals. And we cry unto
   Him, in the words of the 47th verse, "Save us, O Lord our God."

   It may help us to escape out of the meshes of our natural depravity if
   we look back and see the causes of our fathers' sins. To confess our
   personal sin will tend to keep us humble and, in view of the Lord's
   mercy, which has spared and pardoned us, a sense of our guilt will make
   us grateful. The less we think of ourselves, the more we shall think of
   Him whose "mercy endures forever." And if we see where our fathers'
   sins began and how they grew, and what they came to, we may hope that
   the Spirit of God will help us to turn from the beginnings of evil and
   forsake the fountainheads of our iniquities. This will tend to
   repentance and holiness. May we be so worked upon by the Spirit of God
   that we shall not be as our earthly fathers, but become like our
   heavenly Father, who says to us, "Be you followers of God, as dear
   children." We are not to take our fathers after the flesh for our
   example wherein they have gone astray, but our Father who is in Heaven
   we are to imitate by the power of His Grace.

   Great things, whether good or evil, begin with little things. The river
   that rolls its mighty volume to the sea was once a tiny brook. No, it
   started as a springhead, where the child stooped down to drink and,
   with a single drink, seemed as if he would exhaust the supply! The
   rivulet ripples itself into a river. Sin is a stream of this sort. It
   starts with a thought. It increases to a resolve, a word, an act. It
   gathers force and becomes habit and daring rebellion!

   Follow me, therefore, first, when I notice, that lack of understanding
   lies at the fountainhead of sin--"Our fathers understood not Your
   wonders in Egypt." Out of this lack of understanding comes the greater
   offense of ungrateful for-getfulness. Failure of memory follows upon a
   lack of understanding--"They remembered not the multitude of Your
   mercies." This readily leads on to the sad consummation of rebellion.
   Provocation follows upon forgetfulness. Inward faults display
   themselves in outward offenses--"They provoked Him at the sea, even at
   the Red Sea."

   I. Let us begin at the beginning. LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF GOD'S
   WONDERS IS THE SOURCE OF SIN. The wonders that God worked in Egypt were
   exceedingly great and instructive. The 10 plagues were memorable
   masterstrokes of God's judgment upon the proud and notable displays of
   His favor to the oppressed. How Egypt staggered beneath the blows of
   Jehovah! Those tremendous judgments came one after another with
   righteous deliberation and yet with terrible rapidity! Pharaoh and his
   proud nobles were wounded and humbled--the leviathan of Egypt was
   broken in pieces as one that is slain. Surely they for whom all these
   plagues were worked ought to have considered them

   and ought to have spied out the plain lessons which they taught! But
   they failed to do so, for they were dull of understanding. Albeit, God
   had come out of His secret places and had made bare His arm for them,
   yet, "our fathers understood not Your wonders in Egypt."

   We see this to be the case when we read the story, for, at first, when
   God began to work for them, they were so taken up with the present that
   they complained of Moses, for the cruel retort of Pharaoh! He had gone
   in unto the proud monarch and had urged the demand of Jehovah--and the
   tyrant had replied, "You hinder the people from their works; get you
   unto your burdens." He increased their toil by refusing to give the
   people straw to make bricks--and so their bondage was made bitter to
   the last degree--and they groaned as they saw "that they were in evil
   case." They are not blamed for groaning, but it was very blameworthy
   that they should say to Moses and Aaron, "The Lord look upon you and
   judge; because you have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of
   Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands
   to slay us."

   It was mean to blame their friends for the cruel fault of their enemy.
   How wretchedly have we also complained when God, in His gracious
   dealings with us, has caused us an inward grief! He began to show us
   our sin--a very necessary thing, but we kicked against it and said, "Is
   this the Grace of God? Oh, that we were rid of these convictions!" Thus
   the Lord took away our self-confidence, but we were full of unbelief
   and we thought some great evil had happened to us, whereas it was the
   way of God's wisdom and love to make sin as much a bondage to us as
   Egypt was to Israel! How else would we feel our need of redemption and
   be willing to come forth free by the blood of the Lamb? If the Lord
   does but lay His little finger upon us, we complain! And, instead of
   seeing love in our affliction, we cry out as if the Lord dealt harshly
   with us. His mercy designs to teach us some great lesson for our
   eternal benefit, but we murmur and ask, "Is this the love of God to His
   chosen?"

   Our fathers understood not His wonders in Egypt and, oftentimes, this
   is our case--we judge by the feelings of the present and forget the
   eternal future! We cannot understand our burdens and our soul-humbling.
   We stand bewildered and amazed. Though the point is plain enough to
   faith, unbelief does not hear the rod, nor Him that has appointed it--
   and we are taken up with our present smart. Our selfish desire for
   immediate comfort prevents our understanding the great plans of Divine
   Grace.

   Further on we find Israel broken down by utter hopelessness. Moses
   spoke to them again, but we read, "They hearkened not unto Moses for
   anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage." They had been so brutally
   crushed by the Egyptians that they had lost all heart. Slavery had
   killed all the manhood of their race--they were abject, timorous and
   crouching bondsmen. The last ounce that breaks the camel's back was
   laid on them by Pharaoh--and they could no more listen to words of
   hope. Moses said he had come to deliver them. He told them they should
   be brought out with a high hand and an outstretched arm. But they could
   not think it possible--they shook their heads and turned a deaf ear to
   what they regarded as vain words. Hope had fled. They understood not
   that God could, by any possible means, deliver them from the gigantic
   power which held them down.

   Alas, this also has been the case with us! And perhaps is the case with
   some here at this moment. You are so sad and so depressed that you
   cannot believe in salvation. Your presumptuous hopes lie dead in heaps
   round about you and you cannot believe that you will ever be saved.
   "Oh!" you say, "there may be mercy for someone else, but there is no
   mercy for me! God can forgive the chief of sinners, but He will never
   forgive me." Though we tell you of Free Grace and dying love--and of
   pardon for sins of deepest dye, a pardon bought with Jesus' blood--you
   turn a deaf ear to us because your spirit is wounded and faint. You
   understand not God's wonders for and in you. You cannot think that,
   indeed, and of a truth, the Lord Jesus loved you and gave Himself for
   you. You dare not hope that He has ordained you unto eternal life, that
   He will put His Spirit within you! You cannot believe that He will give
   you power to become children of God and joint-heirs with Christ! Your
   very sorrow for sin has made you incapable of understanding God's
   wonders of Divine Grace. This is a painful state of mind.

   You see, dear Friends, these people, though they saw God's plagues on
   the Egyptians, which were mercies to Israel, yet they did not enter
   into their teachings. One would have thought that every Israelite would
   have said, when the thick darkness was over all the land, even
   "darkness that might be felt," "surely Jehovah is a great and mighty
   God!" When there was a storm of thunder and hail over all Egypt, the
   likes of which had never been known before, would it not have been
   natural for them to cry, "Who is like unto You, O Jehovah? We, Your
   people, bow before Your majesty!" The

   right-minded Israelite would have prostrated himself before the supreme
   power of God and would have never, henceforth, doubted the Lord's
   ability to redeem His chosen nation.

   Should not Israel have also learned the royal sovereignty of the Lord
   God? What armies obeyed the call of that great King! At His word the
   river brought forth frogs abundantly. He spoke and there came divers
   sorts of flies and lice in all their borders. "He spoke, and the
   locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number, and did eat up
   all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground."
   Jehovah's camp is very great. The waters were turned into blood and the
   dust into creeping things--the heavens were set on fire--and the
   habitations of men were darkened.

   He who did all these marvelous things is King over all the earth. "He
   smote all the first-born in Egypt, the chief of their strength." Even
   the first-born of Pharaoh, that sits on the throne, was made to die.
   Surely Jehovah is King of Kings! Would you not have thought that His
   people would have felt the force of His Divine dominion and would have
   bowed before His supreme will throughout the rest of their lives? Awed
   by His power and Glory, we might have expected to find in Israel a
   loyal people! But no, they neither seemed to tremble before the power,
   nor to bow before the sovereignty of Jehovah. They murmured against Him
   and declared that He could not deliver them--and complained that they
   had been brought out of Egypt to die by the hand of Pharaoh at the Red
   Sea!

   Beyond all question, they ought to have recognized Jehovah's love to
   them. By so much as the plagues were terrible to Egypt they were
   gracious to His people! Though the Israelites were a race of
   down-trodden slaves, the Lord loved them. He moved Heaven and earth to
   liberate them! He not only made the very dust of Egypt alive for them,
   but He sent swift angels out of Heaven to avenge the wrongs of His
   chosen. The orbs of Heaven and the creatures of earth--all were brought
   to bear upon God's great purpose of Grace towards Israel. Truly said
   the Lord, "I gave Egypt for Your ransom: Ethiopia and Seba for You." It
   was love, wondrous love to Israel, which made the Lord to show His
   signs in Egypt, His wonders in the land of Ham! Why did they not become
   lovingly obedient in return for such favors? Why were they hard of
   heart, stiff of neck and unwilling to be led of the Lord their God?
   Alas, they understood not what the Lord was doing for them!

   To you, Beloved, it may be that the same fault can be laid. God has
   done great wonders for Believers, but, it may be, we have not yet
   learned His power so as to trust His might nor His sovereignty, so as
   to submit to His will nor His love, so as to rejoice in His
   faithfulness. Alas, we have but little understanding! No, worse, we
   have none at all except as the Lord, the Holy Spirit, teaches us to
   profit and instructs us, as children are instructed.

   The tribes of Israel did not see in all this, the claim which the Lord
   had upon them. As a people, they belonged to Him who had made them a
   nation. Because of what He had done for them, the Lord took up a
   peculiar position to them which He would have them acknowledge.
   Remember how, in the 20th chapter of Exodus, before the Lord proclaims
   His Ten Commandments, He says--"I am the Lord your God, which have
   brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage"? By
   this, Jehovah separated them to be His people and He declared Himself
   to be their God. During the plagues, He marked His special love to His
   own, for when the Lord sent a thick darkness over all the land, we
   read, "But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."

   When the cattle of Egypt died, Pharaoh sent and found, upon inquiry,
   that "there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead." When the
   first-born of Egypt fell dead beneath the angel's sword, the sprinkled
   blood of the Passover lamb secured to all Israel protection from the
   midnight slaughter--and men were made to know that God did put a
   difference between His chosen and the men of Egypt! Yet, the favored
   people did not understand it--the Truth of God was conspicuous enough,
   but they did not perceive it as they ought to have done. Neither did
   they practically show that they were the Lord's people and that only He
   was their God. The same slowness to take up our true position, we may
   see and mourn in ourselves. After all the Lord's wonders of Grace
   towards us, we do not exalt Him as our God, nor serve Him as His
   people, as we ought to do. Lord, have mercy upon us!

   The people did not see that their God, by all His wonders, was pledging
   Himself to them. After having done so much for them, He would not leave
   them. Could He have brought them out of Egypt to kill them at the Red
   Sea? They even dared to say that this was their suspicion! Oh, the
   slanders of unbelief! But if they had understood His wonders, they
   would have seen that He who had done such great things for them had
   bound Himself to perfect His purpose and to bring them into the land
   which He had promised to their fathers. "Ah," you say, "they were very
   stupid." I do not defend

   them--but what about yourselves? Have we not been mistrustful? Have we
   not said in our hearts, "He will yet fail us, and our faith will be
   disappointed"? Alas, great God, we blush and are ashamed! But, listen--

   "Determined to save, He watched o'er my path When, Satan's blind slave,
   I sported with death. And can He have taught me to trust in His name,
   And thus far have brought me to put me to shame?" Will the Lord lose
   all that He has worked in us and for us? Is He like the foolish one who
   began to build and was not able to finish? Does the Eternal revoke His
   resolves? Does the Almighty turn from His purposes? Is it not said,
   "The Strength of Israel will not lie; for He is not a man, that He
   should lie, nor the son of man, that He should repent"? O Believer,
   learn this lesson well and trust in your unchanging God! And thus shall
   you understand His wonders in Egypt.

   The fact is, dear Friends, these people had no deeply spiritual work
   upon their hearts. "They understood not His wonders in Egypt" because
   their hearts were hardened by their association with a proud, worldly,
   idolatrous and yet cultured nation--and they had turned aside from the
   spiritual faith of their fathers. Wonders were worked and they saw
   them, and were amazed, but they did not see beneath the surface, nor
   perceive the Lord's meaning in them. Beloved, I pray to God for you who
   are newly called out from the world, that the first working of Divine
   Grace in your souls may be deep, true, clear and lasting. I would have
   you not only know, but understand. Depend upon it, a man's later
   character is very much shaped by the mode of his conversion.

   Why do some turn back altogether? It is because their change of heart
   was not that thorough radical conversion which involves the creation of
   a new nature! They felt certain superficial impressions which they
   mistook for the new birth and they made a hasty profession which they
   could not, afterwards, maintain. They were not thoroughly saved from
   the dominion of sin, or they would have held on to the end. Many
   professing Christians of whom we have a good hope that they will prove
   to be sincere, never had any deep conviction of sin, nor any
   overwhelming sense of their need of Jesus. Therefore they have seen
   little of our Lord in His glorious offices and all-sufficient
   Sacrifice--and have gained no thorough understanding of His Truth. They
   are like slovenly farmers who have plowed their fields after a fashion,
   but they have not gone deep--and the land will never yield more than
   half a crop!

   We have all around us too much surface work. Numbers of conversions are
   true as far as they go, but they go a very little way. I am afraid for
   you if you have only a flimsy experience, a skin-deep conviction, a
   blind man's apprehension of the heavenly Light of God. No wonder if
   very soon you forgot and afterwards rebel! Let us pray God that both in
   ourselves and in those whom we bring to Christ, the work of Grace may
   be deep and thorough--and may our faith in Jesus be sustained by a
   clear understanding of the Gospel and of our Lord's dealings with us!
   The Truth of God, itself, and our experience of it, may be likened to
   food--it is not the food we swallow which benefits us, but that which
   we digest! If undigested food lies in our inward parts and
   unassimilated, it will brood disease rather than promote health. So
   Truth which is not understood and thus taken up into the soul, cannot
   "feed" us in the true spiritual sense of that word.

   You see, Brothers and Sisters, there was a flaw in the Israelites at
   the beginning--"They understood not Your wonders in Egypt." When an
   iron girder suddenly snaps, they tell us that there was a flaw in the
   original casting. It was quite imperceptible at the first and,
   therefore, the girder passed all the tests of the engineer--and it was
   not until years of wear and tear that it gave way. Here was a manifest
   flaw in the casting as to the people of Israel--"They understood not
   Your wonders in Egypt." Had they well understood the Truth at the very
   first, they would not and could not have forgotten it--and they would
   not have been so little influenced by it in their conduct towards God.

   So much upon the first point. We have had before us a subject which
   should produce great thought and devout anxiety.

   II. FAILURE OF MEMORY FOLLOWS UPON LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. Children
   forget what they learn unless they understand it. They may pass the
   School Board standards and yet, in a few years, they may know very
   little. The capacity for forgetting in some children is amazing. Many,
   even among grownups, have splendid memories for forgetting! Alas, it is
   the case with certain of the Lord's people. That which we do not
   understand we readily forget. When a child thoroughly understands his
   lesson, it will be fixed in his memory, but if he has merely learned
   the words and has not entered into their senses, do you wonder that his
   lesson slips away? So was it with Israel in Egypt and at the Red Sea.
   Those sentences follow each other in true logical order--"They
   understood not Your wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude
   of Your mercies."

   Mercies should be remembered. It is a great wrong to God when we bury
   His mercies in the grave of unthankfulness. Especially is this the case
   with distinguishing mercies, wherein the Lord makes us to differ from
   others. Light, when the rest of the land is in darkness! Life, when
   others are smitten with the sword of death! Liberty from an iron
   bondage! O Christians, these are not things to be forgotten! Abundantly
   utter the memory of distinguishing mercies! Discriminating Grace
   deserves unceasing memorials of praise!

   Mercies multiplied should never be forgotten. If they are new every
   morning, our memory of them should be always fresh. Read the story of
   the 10 plagues and see how the Lord heaped up His mercies upon Israel
   with both His hands. Even if they had forgotten one wonder, they ought
   to have remembered others! "Forgot not all His benefits." Alas, some
   men, though their memories are refreshed with renewed loving
   kindnesses, yet prove by their discontent and mistrust that they do not
   remember the Lord's goodness. A grievous thing is this, when God sends
   mercy, and mercy, and mercy, and mercy, and mercy, and mercy--heaps of
   mercies, loads of mercies, hills of mercies, mountains of mercies,
   worlds of mercies--and yet men forget! His mercies are more than the
   stars, more than the drops of dew, more than the sands on the seashore
   and yet we do not remember! This is a mournful and inexcusable fault!

   "They remembered not the multitude of Your mercies." That is to say,
   they did not permanently remember these blessings. They remembered the
   Lord's wonders a little and then they sang--but when the song was over,
   their memories failed. They remembered God's mercies while they marched
   for the first few days as free men who had no daily task of
   brick-making to fulfill--but when they found that Pharaoh pursued them,
   they forgot all the Lord's mighty acts! When they tasted the waters of
   Marah and found them bitter, "they murmured against Moses, saying, What
   shall we drink?" They forgot God's wonders whenever they were in
   straits. They limited The Holy One of Israel by their unbelief! "They
   soon forget His works; they waited not for His counsel; but lusted
   exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert." Our
   remembrance of the Lord's wonders of love should abide with us all our
   days. May the Lord give us a permanent recollection of His great
   goodness, both in Providence and in Grace!

   Hutton, Bishop of Durham, was, one day riding over the bleak northern
   hills. He stopped and, giving his horse to his servant, he went aside
   from the road to kneel down on a certain spot. He always did so when he
   reached that place, for in the day of his wealth and honor, he had not
   forgotten that when he was a poor boy he had crossed those wild hills,
   without shoes and stockings, and had turned a cow out of her place that
   he might warm his feet with what little heat remained in the place
   where the creature had lain. He had become bishop of a rich see and a
   man of renown, but he never passed that spot without kneeling down and
   praising God. May we have faithful memories for the goodness of our
   faithful God! The Israelites had memories out of which the mercies of
   God soon faded. The Lord save us from being like they and cause us to
   bless His name for what He did for us 50 years ago! Some of us would
   not have been among His people, today, if it had not been for the
   Lord's favors in our early youth--therefore let us praise Him for old
   mercies as well as for new ones.

   But Israel did not remember God's mercies powerfully. If they
   remembered these things, yet the remembrance did not enable them to
   bear up under present discouragements. The Egyptians pursued them and
   when they heard the cracking of the whips and the neighing of the
   horses, they cried out unto the Lord--they whined out--"It had been
   better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness!"
   Had they forgotten Jehovah, who had glorified Himself over Egypt and
   had crippled all her power? Their memory of Jehovah's wonders had not
   influence enough over them to keep up their courage! Oh, for such a
   powerful memory of God's mercies that we may never distrust Him!

   They did not remember practically. Their lives were not affected
   thereby. True gratitude shows itself in acts and deeds. A gentleman had
   been the means of making a position for a tradesman, but, by a
   misfortune, he came to be, himself, in need of immediate help to tide
   over a season of great pressure. He called at the house of the person
   he had so successfully helped and found the wife at home. He told her
   the case and she answered at once, "My husband will be ready to lend
   you his name to the full amount required. He will hasten to you the
   moment you need him, and be glad to do so." A prudent neighbor,
   afterwards, said, "But you may have to pay away all you have in the
   world." "Yes," said the grateful wife, "we do not mind that--he was the
   making of us and if we have to lose everything for his sake, we shall
   do it very cheerfully-- for we shall only be back to where we were when
   he first helped us."

   That is a form of gratitude which is rare enough in this world, though
   I have seen it here and there. Beloved, if the Lord were to take away
   all that we have, we should only be back where we were at the
   beginning! We have nothing but

   what we have received from Him! He takes nothing from us but what He
   first gave us--let us bless a taking as well as a giving God. Oh, for
   this practical gratitude towards the Lord, that we may in all things
   either do His will cheerfully, or suffer it patiently! If we remember
   the multitude of His mercies practically, we shall be ready to
   surrender honor, ease, health, estate, yes, life, itself, for Him who
   gave Himself for us! Oh, to remember God's mercies practically in
   everyday life, in thought and word and deed!

   In fact, the Lord's mercies ought to be remembered progressively. We
   should think more and more of His exceeding kindness. A Christian man's
   life should be like another Bible, another Book of Chronicles. When we
   come to read through our personal life story, we should say, "Neither
   the 9th chapter of Nehemiah, nor the 106th Psalm can exceed my
   experience. The Lord has dealt well with His servant, according to His
   Word. If some of us had opportunity to write our lives in full--which
   we could hardly venture to do because there are private passages
   between our souls and our God which no human eye may read--how fully
   could we now testify to the faithful love of our Covenant God! On our
   parts, sin and weakness and fickleness have been conspicuous in our
   career. But on the Lord's part, Grace and Truth, and faithfulness and
   love shine forth as the sun! Beloved, we must not let go of the memory
   of the Lord's matchless kindness, but we must remember it more and
   more! The older we are, the more must we trust in Him who has not
   suffered one of His promises to fail!

   III. I need a little time for the third head, which is this--GRIEVOUS
   PROVOCATION FOLLOWED THEIR

   FORGETFULNESS OF GOD. Lack of understanding begat forgetfulness and
   forgetfulness brought forth rebellion. Let me read the last part of the
   text--"They provoked Him at the sea, even at the Red Sea." Why does the
   Psalmist dwell upon the place and say, "at the sea, even at the Red
   Sea"? Why was it worse to provoke the Lord there than elsewhere? It
   evidently was so, for the Inspired Scripture mentions the spot twice to
   put an emphasis upon it. Why was this?

   The offense, itself, was grievous anywhere. They doubted God when they
   heard that Pharaoh pursued them and they said, "Because there were no
   graves in Egypt, have You taken us away to die in the wilderness?" This
   imputation of cruelty to their faithful God provoked His sacred heart.
   The Lord is full of pity and His name is Love and, therefore, He is not
   easily provoked. But He declares that He was provoked by this display
   of their mistrust. They provoked Him--they called Him forth, as it
   were, to battle! They vexed Him and stirred Him up to contend with
   them. O Brothers and Sisters, after so much love as God has shown us,
   we must not fall to provoking Him! Let us far rather spend our lives in
   extolling Him! To provoke Him at any time is a wanton
   wickedness--unjust, ungenerous, diabolical. It is no common sin which
   thus provokes the long-suffering Lord. Many a sin God has endured
   patiently, but in this case He is provoked to anger! This is an offense
   which touches the apple of His eye and causes His jealousy to burn like
   coals of fire. O children of God, how can you provoke your Father to
   wrath? The Lord have mercy upon us! We must bow low at His feet with
   sorrowful repentance. Let us shun this fault in the future.

   But why did their transgression at the sea so greatly anger the Lord?
   Was it because it came at the outset of their existence as a nation?
   They had not gone many days' journey out of Egypt before they rebelled.
   They had not yet eaten up the bread they carried in their kneading
   troughs and they had scarcely met their first difficulty--and yet they
   hastened to provoke their God! How could they rebel so soon? They had
   scarcely reached the Red Sea before they began provoking the Lord with
   their dishonorable suspicions. O young Christian, if you provoke the
   Lord as soon as you are converted, your conduct will be black, indeed!
   Only a day or two ago you sang His praises and shouted, "Hallelujah!
   The blood of the Lamb has saved me." Will you so speedily distrust the
   Lord and provoke Him "at the sea, even at the Red Sea"? What? Stumble
   in the first few steps? God grant it may not be so!

   If you feel that you have already thus provoked the Lord, confess the
   wrong and ask pardon through the precious blood. To begin to doubt
   almost as soon as you begin to believe is a wretched business. What?
   Have you come out of Egypt and have you brought its bondage with you?
   You have been saved by the sprinkled blood and you have fed upon the
   Paschal lamb--and can you so soon utter words dishonoring to your
   delivering Lord? To doubt in the presence of a mercy is to doubt,
   indeed! To doubt the power of the blood of Christ when you have newly
   been saved, to doubt the power of the Holy Spirit to keep you to the
   end when you have just been renewed--why, this is aggravated guilt! It
   is sadly common, but it is none the less grievous to the heart of God.
   He marks it down and there stands the record--"They provoked Him at the
   sea, even at the Red Sea." This is a poor beginning of a march to
   Canaan.

   Now this Red Sea was the place of their consecration. Here they were
   "baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea." Here it was that
   they said, "He is my God, and I will prepare Him an habitation; my
   father's God, and I will exalt Him." As they stood by that Red Sea
   which had swallowed up all their enemies, they sang the praises of God
   and proposed to do great things in His honor! What wonderful obedience
   they meant to render! And yet they provoked Him then and there! What?
   Will you come up from the waters of your Baptism and go home and
   provoke God by unholy conversation and ungovernable temper? Can any of
   you go from the Communion Table into sin? I heard of one who went from
   the Table of the Lord across the street into the public-house. This is
   too gross! Such conduct grieves holy men and much more, the Holy God.
   To go from prayer to robbery, from reading the Word to fellowship with
   ungodly men--this must be terribly provoking to the thrice holy
   Jehovah! It is as though it were written again, "They provoked Him at
   the sea, even at the Red Sea."

   It is a high crime and misdemeanor to sin in the presence of a great
   mercy. There is the sea. They have just marched through it and they
   have reached Marah, where the waters are brackish. If they now distrust
   and complain, close on the heels of their great deliverance, it will be
   a crime, indeed! O men, what are you doing? There is the Red Sea which
   God divided and yet you think He cannot give you water to drink! O
   fools and slow of heart, thus to doubt the Almighty! Doubt in the
   presence of a mercy! Doubt while so great a favor is before your eyes!
   This is evil, indeed! I find the Hebrew has been read by some, "They
   provoked Him in the sea, even in the Red Sea"--while they were passing
   through the deep they were rebelling! You will hardly believe it! What?
   When the waters stood upright as in an heap and were a wall on either
   side of them--and they walked through the depths of the sea and found
   good footing where sea monsters once had whelped and stabled--were they
   then provoking Him? Yes, they carried their sinful hearts with them
   even into the heart of the sea!

   Beloved, do not bear hard upon these Israelites, bear hard upon
   yourselves and hate the sin which dares intrude within the sacred
   enclosures of your joy in the Cross and dares to tempt you even when
   the five wounds of Jesus are shining on your soul like stars of God!
   Hate the sins which follow you to the Table of the Lord! Hate the
   wandering mind which taints the sacred bread and wine and defiles you
   when the instructive symbols are yet in your mouths! Abhor the sin
   which dogs your heels and follows you even to your knees--and hinders
   you in drawing near to God in prayer. Oh, the accursed sin which even
   on Tabor's top makes us fall asleep or talk foolishly! Lord, have mercy
   upon us and forgive the sins of our holy places and let it not stand
   against us in your Book that, "They provoked You at the sea, even at
   the Red Sea." It was called the Sea of Weeds and truly many were the
   weeds which grew, not only in the water, but in the hearts of those who
   stood on its shore!

   1 must give one or two touches to complete the picture. This
   provocation of God was all the worse because they had only just done
   singing. What a song it was! Handel, with all the majesty of his
   half-Inspired music, can hardly set forth that wondrous song of Israel
   at the sea. "I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea." That
   was a noble anthem, but murmuring was a miserable sequel to it. "The
   Lord shall reign forever and ever," was a glorious hallelujah, but
   before its echoes had ceased to stir the heart of the lone hills, the
   same tongues were heard to complain against the Lord! "The Lord is my
   strength and song, and He is become my salvation," died away into
   mutterings of unbelief!

   Do you wonder that God was provoked? Have you ever acted so? Did you
   ever rise high in rapture and praise the Lord upon the high-sounding
   cymbals--and then find yourself groveling on the ground within an hour?
   Have you felt so jubilant that you could have snatched Gabriel's silver
   trumpet from his mouth that you might blow it with all your might? And
   have you before long been looking for a mouse hole in which to hide
   your miserable head by reason of your unbelief? What fools we are!
   "Verily every man at his best estate is altogether vanity." When we
   know most, we are ignorant. When we swell to our greatest, we are big
   nothings! When God makes much of us, we think least of ourselves. How
   greatly do we prize and praise the precious blood of Jesus which
   cleanses us from all sin!

   This evil happened near the time of their strong faith. You remember
   how they sang, "Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men
   of Moab, trembling, shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of
   Canaan shall melt away. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the
   greatness of Your arm they shall be as still as a stone; till Your
   people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which You have
   purchased. You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
   Your inheritance, in the place, O lord, which You have made for You to
   dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord,

   which Your hands have established." They felt quite sure of conquering
   the land and chasing out the foe. They were so strong in faith that
   they thought they should never again mistrust the Lord, whose right
   hand was so glorious in power! The exultant women who followed Miriam
   never suspected that they could doubt the Lord, whose right hand had
   dashed the enemy in pieces.

   One of them would probably have said, "As for our enemies, the depths
   have covered them, there is not one of them left. I shall never fear
   again. I have attained full assurance and perfection and I shall never
   again mistrust the Lord." Yet these were the people who speedily
   murmured for lack of bread until the Lord heard them and was grieved! I
   dare say the men of the Red Sea said, each one, "My mountain stands
   firm, I shall never be moved"--and yet in how brief an hour were they
   challenging the faithfulness of Jehovah--and questioning His power to
   give them bread in the wilderness! Lord, what is man? We distrust
   Providence, we suspect Grace and we question the Lord, Himself--and all
   this after the Lord had made our assurance doubly sure! We are sad
   creatures and yet the Lord does not cast us away, for it is written,
   "Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His
   mighty power to be known."

   Two things more and I have done. Admire the patient faithfulness of our
   God. Jehovah, though provoked, still loves His people. Admire His love
   to ourselves and especially that He should entertain such constancy of
   affection towards such wayward, fickle, unreliable souls as we are!

   Next, believe God so as to cease to grieve Him. Do not start aside at
   the next little puddle you see in the road--it is not an ocean. Do not
   whine that you will be devoured the next time you see a cat in the
   garden-- after all, it is not a lion. Do not groan, "I cannot pass this
   dread abyss," for it is only a little ditch which you can leap by
   faith. God helping you, rest not till you become "strong in the Lord
   and in the power of His might." Doubt God when He gives you cause to do
   so, but not till then! If God had left those Israelites, once, they
   might have had some excuse for distrusting Him, but He had never done
   so. If He had ever failed in His judgments, they might have had some
   excuse for unbelief, but when He threatened their enemies with plagues,
   those plagues never failed to come! Was there a single weak point in
   what God had done for them? They had no ground, whatever, for their
   unbelief!

   O Brothers and Sisters, let us never distrust our God until He gives us
   ground for doing so--and that will never be! O Blessed Holy Spirit,
   strengthen the faith of Your people this day, and may that faith create
   in us perfect obedience to the will of the Lord, so that henceforth we
   may magnify His holy name and walk with Him until we see His face
   unveiled above! The Lord sanctify us unto Himself, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Psalm 106.
     __________________________________________________________________

"My Times Are In Your Hand"

   (No. 2205)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 17, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "My times are in Your hand." Psalm 31:15.

   DAVID was sad--his life was spent with grief and his years with
   sighing. His sorrow had wasted his strength and even his bones were
   consumed within him. Cruel enemies pursued him with malicious craft,
   even seeking his life. At such a time he used the best resource of
   grief, for he says in verse 14, "But I trusted in You, O Lord." He had
   no other refuge but that which he found in faith in the Lord, his God.
   If enemies slandered him, he did not render railing for railing. If
   they devised to take away his life, he did not meet violence with
   violence, but he calmly trusted in the Lord. They ran here and there,
   using all kinds of nets and traps to make the man of God their victim,
   but he met all their inventions with the one simple defense of trust in
   God. Many are the fiery darts of the Wicked One, but our shield is one.
   The shield of faith not only quenches fiery darts, but it breaks arrows
   of steel. Though the javelins of the foe were dipped in the venom of
   Hell, yet our one shield of faith would hold us harmless, casting them
   off from us!

   Thus David had the grand resource of faith in the hour of danger. Note
   well that he uttered a glorious claim, the greatest claim that man has
   ever made--"I said, You are my God." He that can say, "This kingdom is
   mine," makes a royal claim! He that can say, "This mountain of silver
   is mine," makes a wealthy claim. But he that can say to the Lord, "You
   are my God," has said more than all monarchs and millionaires can
   reach! If this God is your God by His gift of Himself to you, what more
   can you have? If Jehovah has been made your own by an act of
   appropriating faith, what more can be conceived of? You have not the
   world, but you have the Maker of the world--and that is far more! There
   is no measuring the greatness of his treasure who has God to be his All
   in All!

   Having thus taken to the best resource by trusting in Jehovah and
   having made the grandest claim possible by saying, "You are my God,"
   the Psalmist now stays himself upon a grand old doctrine, one of the
   most wonderful that was ever revealed to men. He sings, "My times are
   in Your hand." This to him was a most cheering fact--he had no fear as
   to his circumstances, since all things were in the Divine hands. He was
   not shut up unto the hands of the enemy, but his feet stood in a large
   room, for he was in a space large enough for the ocean, seeing the Lord
   had placed him in the hollow of His hand! To be entirely at the
   disposal of God is life and liberty for us.

   The great Truth of God is this--all that concerns the Believer is in
   the hands of the Almighty God. "My times"-- these change and shift--but
   they change only in accordance with unchanging love and they shift only
   according to the purpose of One with whom is no variableness nor shadow
   of a turning! "My times," that is to say, my ups and my downs, my
   health and my sickness, my poverty and my wealth--all those are in the
   hands of the Lord who arranges and appoints according to His holy will,
   the length of my days and the darkness of my nights! Storms and calms
   vary the seasons at the Divine appointment. Whether times are reviving
   or depressing remains with Him who is Lord both of time and of
   eternity--and we are glad it is so!

   We assent to the statement, "My times are in Your hand," as to their
   result. Whatever is to come out of our life is in our heavenly Father's
   hands. He guards the vine of life and He also protects the clusters
   which shall be produced thereby. If life is as a field, the field is
   under the hand of the great Husbandman and the harvest of that field is
   also with Him! The ultimate results of His works of Grace upon us and
   of His education of us in this life are in the highest hands! We are
   not in our own hands, nor in the hands of earthly teachers, but we are
   under the skillful operation of hands which make nothing in vain! The
   close of life is not decided by the sharp knife of the fates, but by
   the hands of Love. We shall not die before our time, neither shall we
   be forgotten and left upon the stage too long!

   Not only are we, ourselves, in the hand of the Lord, but all that
   surrounds us. Our times make up a kind of atmosphere of existence--and
   all this is under Divine arrangement. We dwell within the palm of God's
   hand. We are absolutely at His disposal and all our circumstances are
   arranged by Him in all their details. We are comforted to have it so.

   How came the Psalmist's times to be thus in God's hands? I should
   answer, first, that they were there in the order of nature, according
   to the eternal purpose and decree of God. All things are ordained of
   God and are settled by Him, according to His wise and holy
   predestination. Whatever happens here happens not by chance, but
   according to the counsel of the Most High! The acts and deeds of men
   below, though left wholly to their own wills, are the counterpart of
   that which is written in the purpose of Heaven. The open acts of
   Providence, here below, tally exactly with that which is written in the
   secret Book which no eye of man or angel as yet has scanned. This
   eternal purpose superintended our birth. "In your Book all my members
   were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there
   was none of them." In your Book, every footstep of every creature is
   recorded before the creature is made! God has mapped out the pathway of
   every man who traverses the plains of life. Some may doubt this, but
   all agree that God foresees all things--and how can they be certainly
   foreseen unless they are certain to be?. It is no mean comfort to a man
   of God that he feels that, by Divine arrangement and sacred
   predestination, his times are in the hands of God!

   But David's times were in God's hand in another sense, namely, that he
   had, by faith, committed them all to God. Observe carefully the 5th
   verse--"Into Your hand I commit my spirit: You have redeemed me, O Lord
   God of Truth." In life we use the words which our Lord so patiently
   used in death--we hand over our spirits to the hands of God. If our
   lives were not appointed of Heaven, we would wish they were. If there
   were no overruling Providence, we would crave for one. We would merge
   our own wills in the will of the great God and cry, "Not as we will,
   but as You will." It would be a hideous thought to us if any one point
   of our life story were left to chance, or to the frivolities of our own
   fancy. But with joyful hope we fall back upon the eternal foresight and
   the Infallible Wisdom of God and cry, "You shall choose our inheritance
   for us." We would beg Him to take our times into His hands, even if
   they were not there.

   Moreover, Beloved Brothers and Sisters, our times are in the Lord's
   hands because we are one with Christ Jesus. "We are members of His
   body, of His flesh and of His bones." Everything that concerns Christ
   touches the great Father's heart. He thinks more of Jesus than of all
   the world! Therefore it follows that when we become one with Jesus, we
   become conspicuous objects of the Father's care! He takes us in hand
   for the sake of His dear Son! He that loves the Head, loves all the
   members of the mystical body! We cannot conceive of the dear Redeemer
   as ever being out of the Father's mind-- neither can any of us who are
   in Christ be away from the Father's active, loving care--our times are
   always in His hands. All His eternal purposes work towards the
   glorifying of the Son and quite as surely they work together for the
   good of those who are in His Son. The purposes which concern our Lord
   and ourselves are so intertwisted as never to be separated!

   To have our times in God's hands must mean not only that they are at
   God's disposal, but that they are arranged by the highest wisdom. God's
   hand never errs and if our times are in His hand, those times are
   ordered rightly. We need not puzzle our brains to understand the
   dispensations of Providence--a much easier and wiser course is open to
   us, namely--to believe the hands of the Lord work all things for the
   best. Sit still, O child, at your great Father's feet, and let Him do
   as seems Him good! When you cannot comprehend Him, know that a babe
   cannot understand the wisdom of its parent. Your Father comprehends all
   things, though you do not--let His wisdom be enough for you! Everything
   in the hand of God is where it may be left without anxiety and it is
   where it will be carried through to a prosperous issue. Things prosper
   which are in His hands.

   "My times are in Your hand," is an assurance that none can disturb, or
   pervert, or poison. In that hand we rest as securely as rests a babe
   upon its mother's breast. Where could our interests be so well secured
   as in the eternal hands? What a blessing it is to see, by the eye of
   faith, all things that concern you grasped in the hands of God! What
   peace as to every matter which could cause anxiety flows into the soul
   when we see all our hopes built upon so stable a foundation and
   preserved by such supreme power! "My times are in your hand!"

   Before I go into this subject, to show the sweetness of this
   confidence, I pray every Christian here to read the text and take it in
   the singular, and not as we sang it just now--

   "Our times are in Your hand, Whatever they may be,

   Pleasing or painful, dark or bright, As best may seem to Thee."

   We find it in the Psalm, "My times are in Your hand." This does not
   exclude the whole body of the saints enjoying this safety together,
   but, after all, the Truth of God is sweetest when each man tastes the
   flavor of it for himself. Come, let each man take to himself this
   Doctrine of the Supreme Appointment of God and believe that it stands
   true as to his own case, "My times are in Your hand." The wings of the
   cherubim cover me. The Lord Jesus loved me and gave Himself for me--and
   my times are in those hands which were nailed to the Cross for my
   redemption! What will be the effect of such a faith, if it is clear,
   personal and enduring? This shall be our subject at this season. May
   the Holy Spirit help us!

   I. A clear conviction that our times are in the hand of God WILL CREATE
   WITHIN US A SENSE OF THE NEARNESS OF GOD. If the hand of God is laid
   upon all our surroundings, God, Himself, is near us. Our Puritan
   fathers walked with God the more readily because they believed in God
   as arranging everythingin their daily business and domestic life. They
   saw Him in the history of the nation and in all the events which
   transpired. The tendency of this age is to get further and further from
   God. Men will scarcely tolerate a Creator, now, but everything must be
   evolved. To get God one stage further back is the ambition of modern
   philosophy, whereas, if we were wise--we would labor to clear out all
   obstacles and leave a clear channel for drawing near to God--and for
   God to draw near to us. When we see that in His hands are all our ways,
   we feel that God is real and near.

   "My times are in Your hand." Then there is nothing left to chance.
   Events happen not to man by a fortune which has no order or purpose in
   it. "The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is
   of the Lord." Chance is a heathenish idea which the teaching of the
   Word has cast down, even as the Ark threw down Dagon and broke him in
   pieces. Blessed is that man who has done with chance, who never speaks
   of luck, but believes that from the least, even to the greatest, all
   things are ordained of the Lord. We dare not leave out the least event!
   The creeping of an aphid upon a rosebud is as surely arranged by the
   decree of Providence as the march of a pestilence through a nation.
   Believe this, for if the least is omitted from the supreme government,
   so may the next be, and the next, till nothing is left in the Divine
   hands. There is no place for chance, since God fills all things.

   "My times are in Your hand" is an assurance which also puts an end to
   the grim idea of an iron fate compelling all things. Have you the
   notion that fate grinds on like an enormous wheel, ruthlessly crushing
   everything that lies in its way, not pausing for pity, nor turning
   aside for mercy? Remember, if you liken Providence to a wheel, it must
   be a wheel which is full of eyes! Its every revolution is in wisdom and
   goodness! God's eyes leave nothing blind in Providence, but fill all
   things with sight. God works all things according to His purpose, but
   then He Himself works them. There is all the difference between the
   lone machinery of fixed fate and the Presence of a gracious, loving
   Spirit ruling all things. Things happen as He plans them, but He
   Himself is there to make them happen, to moderate, guide and secure
   results! Our great joy is not, "My times are in the wheel of destiny,"
   but, "My times are in Your hand." With a living, loving God to
   superintend all things, we feel ourselves at home, resting near our
   Father's heart.

   "My times are in Your hand." Does not this reveal the condescension of
   the Lord? He has all Heaven to worship Him and all worlds to govern,
   and yet, "my times"--the times of such an inconsiderable and unworthy
   person as I am-- are in His hands! Now, what is man that it should be
   so? Wonder of wonders, that God should not only think of me, but should
   make my concerns His concerns and take my matters into His hands! He
   has the stars in His hands and yet He puts us there. He deigns to take
   in hand the passing interests of obscure men and lowly women!

   Beloved, God is near His people with all His attributes, His wisdom,
   His power, His faithfulness, His immutability and these are, under
   oath, to work for the good of those who put their trust in Him. "All
   things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
   the called according to His purpose." Yes, God considers our times and
   thinks them over, with His heart and soul planning to do us good. That
   august mind, out of which all things spring, bows itself to us and
   those eternal wings, which cover the universe, also brood over us and
   our household, and our daily needs and woes! Our God sits not still as
   a listless spectator of our griefs, suffering us to be drifted like
   waifs upon the waters of circumstance, but is busily occupying Himself
   at all times for the defense and perfecting of His children. He leads
   us that He may bring us home to the place where His flock shall rest
   forever.

   What a bliss this is! Our times, in all their needs and aspects, are in
   God's hands and, therefore, God is always caring for us! How near it
   brings God to us and us to God! Child of God, go not tomorrow into the
   field, lamenting that God is

   not there! He will bless your going out. Come not home to your chamber,
   crying, "Oh, that I knew where I might find Him!" He will bless your
   coming in! Go not to your bed, dreaming that you are left an
   orphan--neither wake up in the morning with a sense of loneliness upon
   you--you are not alone, for the Father is with you!

   Will you not feel how good it is that God should come so close to you
   and handle your bread and your water, and bless your bed and your
   board? Are you not happy to be allowed to come so close to God, as to
   say, "My times are in Your hand"? There is a great deal in this first
   point as to the nearness of the Lord--and if you will turn it over--you
   will see more and more that a conviction that our times are in God's
   hand tends to create a happy and holy sense of the nearness of God to
   us.

   II. THIS TRUTH IS A COMPLETE ANSWER TO MANY A TEMPTATION. You know how
   craftily Satan will

   urge a temptation. He says, "Now you have a large family and your chief
   duty is to provide for them. Your position brings with it many needs.
   Here is a plan of making money--others follow it. It may not be quite
   straight, but you must not be particular in such a world as this, for
   nobody else is." How will you meet this? Can you say to Satan, "It is
   not my business to provide for myself or for my family--my times are in
   God's hand and His name is Jehovah-Jireh--The Lord Will Provide. And I
   will not do a questionable thing, though it would fill my house with
   silver and gold from the cellar to the chimney pot. I shall not meddle
   with my Lord's business. It is His to provide for me--it is mine to
   walk uprightly and obey His Word"?

   This is a noble answer to the arch-enemy! But supposing he says, "Well,
   but you are already in difficulties and you cannot extricate yourself
   if you are too precise. A poor man cannot afford to have a
   conscience--it is an expensive luxury in these days. Give your
   conscience a holiday and you can soon get out of your trouble." Let
   your reply be, "O Prince of Darkness, it is no business of mine to
   extricate myself! My times are in God's hand. I have taken my case to
   Him and He will work for me in this matter better than I can do for
   myself! He does not wish me to do a wrong thing, that I may do for
   myself what He has promised to do for me." We are not called upon to
   eke out God's wisdom with a bit of our own wickedness. God forbid! Do
   the right, even if the heavens should fall. The Lord who has taken your
   business into His hands will bear you through.

   "Well," says one, "we may use a little discreet policy in religious
   matters and keep the peace by wise compromise. We may accomplish our
   end all the sooner by going a little roundabout. If you can just let
   the Truth of God wait for a little until the fine weather comes, and
   the silver slippers are in season, then she will be saved a good deal
   of annoyance!" Brothers and Sisters, it is not for us to pick and plan
   times in this fashion. God's cause is in God's hands and God would not
   have us help His cause by a compromising hand being laid on His Ark.
   Remember what the hand of Uzzah brought on him, though he meant well.
   Let us continue steadfast in the integrity of our walk and we shall
   find our times are in God's hand--and that they are well ordered and
   need no hasty and unholy interposition on our part.

   Brethren, is it not a delightful thing for us to know that though we
   are on a stormy voyage, the Lord, Himself, is at the helm? The course
   we do not know, nor even our present latitude and longitude. But the
   Pilot knows all about us and also about the sea. It will be our wisdom
   not to interfere with our Captain's orders. They put up a notice on the
   steamboats, "Do not speak to the man at the wheel." We are very apt, in
   our unbelief, to dispute with Him to whom the steering of our vessel is
   entrusted. We shall not confuse Him, thank God, but we often confound
   and confuse ourselves by our idle complaining against the living Lord!
   No, when you are tempted to presume, or to act in a despairing haste,
   or to hide your principles, or to do something which is not defensible
   in order that you may arrange your times more comfortably, answer with
   a decided "No," and say, "My times are in God's hand"--and there, by
   His Grace, I will leave

   them!"

   When the devil comes with His subtle questions and insinuations, refer
   Him to your Lord, in whose hands your times are placed. When you have a
   lawsuit, the opposite side will likely come and talk with you, to see
   if they can get something out of you. It will be your wisdom to reply,
   "If you have anything to say, say it to my solicitor." If the devil
   comes to you and you get into an argument with him, he will beat you,
   for he is a very ancient lawyer and he has been at the business for so
   many ages that you cannot match him. Send him to your Advocate! Refer
   him to the Wonderful, the Counselor! Always shelter beneath this fact,
   "My times are in His hand. I have left the whole business to Another
   and I cannot dishonor Him by meddling." Satan knows the Christ too well
   to go to Him--he knows the taste of His broadsword, of, "It is
   written." He will not contest with Jesus if we leave Him to plead the
   causes of our soul!

   III. In the third place, THIS CONVICTION IS A SUFFICIENT SUPPORT
   AGAINST THE FEAR OF MEN. We

   may say to ourselves, when our enemies bear very hard upon us, "I am
   not in their hands. My times are in Your hand." Here are gentlemen
   judging and condemning us with great rapidity. They say, "He has made a
   great mistake. He is an old bigot. He has snuffed himself out." This is
   easier said than done. The candle still shines. They say of you, "He is
   foolish and headstrong and, on religious matters, he is as obstinate as
   a mule! But he will come to grief." You have not come to grief, yet, in
   the way they predict, and they had better not prophesy till they know!
   The godly are not in the hands of those who mock them! The wicked may
   gnash their teeth at Believers, but they cannot destroy them! Here is
   their comfort--they have committed their spirit to the hands of
   God--and He will sacredly preserve the precious deposit. Fear not the
   judgments of men! Appeal to a higher court. Take the case to the King's
   Bench. Go to God, Himself, with the matter, and He will bring forth
   your judgment as the light and your righteousness as the noonday.

   Do the malicious resolve to crush you? They will use to the utmost
   their little power, but there is a higher power which will hold them
   back. Rejoicingly say, "My times are in Your hand." Do they treat you
   with contempt? Do they sneer at you? What does that matter? Your honor
   comes not from men! Their contempt is the highest complimentthe wicked
   can pay you.

   Alas, many professors place their times in the hands of the world! If
   they prosper and grow rich, they see an opportunity of social advantage
   and they quit their humbler friends to join a more respectable sect.
   How many are lost to fidelity because their prosperous times are not in
   God's hands, but in their own? Some, on the other hand, when they are
   in adversity, get away from the Lord. The excuse is, "I cannot go to
   the House of God any more, for my clothes are not so respectable as
   they used to be." Is your poverty to take you out of your Lord's hands?
   Never let it be so! But say, "My times are in Your hand." Cleave to the
   Lord in losses as well as in gains and so let allyour times be with
   Him.

   How often we meet with people who are staggered by slander! It is
   impossible to stop malicious tongues. They wound and even slay the
   characters of the godly. The tried one cries, "I cannot bear it! I
   shall give all up." Why? Why yield to mere talk? Even these cruel
   tongues are in God's hands! Can you not brave their attacks? They
   cannot utter a single whisper more than God permits! Go on your way, O
   righteous man, and let false tongues pour forth their poison as they
   will. "Every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall
   condemn." If my times are in God's hands, no man can do me harm unless
   God permits it. Though my soul is among lions, yet no lion can bite me
   while Jehovah's angel is my guard!

   This feeling, that our interests are safe in the highest keeping,
   breeds an independent spirit. It prevents our cringing before the great
   and our flattering the strong. At the same time, it removes all
   tendency to envy, so that you do not wish for the prosperity of the
   wicked, nor fret yourself because of evildoers. When one knows that his
   times are in God's hands, he would not change places with a king! No,
   nor even with an angel!

   IV. A full belief in the statement of our text is A CURE FOR PRESENT
   WORRY. O Lord, if my times are in Your hands, I have cast my care on
   You, and I trust and am not afraid! Why is it, my Sister--for this
   habit of worrying abounds among the gracious sisterhood--why do you vex
   yourself about a matter which is in the hands of God? If He has
   undertaken for you, what cause have you for anxiety? And you, my
   Brother--for there are plenty of men who are nervous and fretful--why
   do you want to interfere with the Lord's business? If the case is in
   His hands, what need can there be for you to be prying and crying? You
   were worrying this morning and fretting last night--and you are
   distressed, now, and will be worse tomorrow morning. May I ask you a
   question? Did you ever get any good by fretting? When there was not
   rain enough for your farm, did you ever fret a shower down? When there
   was too much rain, or you thought so, did you ever worry the clouds
   away? Tell me, did you ever make a sixpence by worrying? It is a very
   unprofitable business!

   Do you answer, "What, then, are we to do in troublous times?" Why, go
   to Him into whose hand you have committed yourself and your times!
   Consult with Infinite Wisdom by prayer. Console yourself with Infinite
   Love by fellowship with God. Tell the Lord what you feel and what you
   fear. Ten minutes' praying is better than a year's murmuring! He that
   waits upon God and casts his burden upon Him may lead a royal
   life--indeed, he will be far happier than a king!

   To leave our times with God is to live as free from care as the birds
   upon the bough. If we fret, we shall not glorify God, and we shall not
   constrain others to see what true religion can do for us in the hour of
   tribulation. Fret and worry put it out of our power to act wisely. But
   if we can leave everything with God because everything really is in His
   hands,

   we shall be peaceful and our action will be deliberate. And for that
   very reason it will be more likely to be wise. He that rolls his burden
   upon the Lord will be strong to do or to suffer--and his days shall be
   as the days of Heaven upon the earth. I admire the serenity of Abraham.
   He never seems to be in a fluster, but he moves grandly, like a prince
   among men. He is much more than the equal of the greatest man he
   meets--we can hardly see Lot with a microscope when we have once seen
   Abraham! Why was that? Because he believed in God and staggered not.

   Half the joy of life lies in expectation. Our children get greater
   pleasure out of expecting a holiday than they do out of the day,
   itself. It is much the same with ourselves. If we believe that all our
   times are in God's hands, we shall be expecting great things from our
   heavenly Father. When we get into a difficulty we shall say, "I am now
   going to see the wonders of God and to learn, again, how surely He
   delivers them that trust in Him!" I thank God I have learned at times
   to glory in necessities, as opening a window into Heaven for me, out of
   which the Lord would abundantly pour forth His supplies. It has been to
   me so unspeakable a delight to see how the Lord has supplied my needs
   for the Orphanage, the College and other works, that I have half wished
   to be in straits, that I might see how the Lord would appear for me!

   I remember, some time ago, when, year after year, all the money came in
   for the various enterprises, I began to look back with regret upon
   those grand days when the Lord permitted the brook Cherith to dry up
   and called off the ravens, with their bread and meat, and then found
   some other way of supplying the orphans' needs! In those days, the Lord
   used to come to me, as it were, walking on the tops of the mountains,
   stepping from peak to peak and, by marvelous deeds, supplying all my
   needs, according to His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus!

   Do you know, I almost wished that the Lord would stop the streams and
   then let me see how He can fetch water out of the Rock! He did so, not
   very long ago. Funds ran very low and then I cried to Him and He heard
   me out of His holy hill. How glad was I to hear the footsteps of the
   ever-present Lord, answering to His child's prayer and letting him know
   that his times were still in his Father's hands! Surely it is better to
   trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man! It is a joy worth
   worlds to be driven where none but the Lord can help you--and then to
   see His mighty hand pulling you out of the net! The joy lies mainly in
   the fact that you are sure it is the Lord and sure that He is near you.
   This blessed realization of the Lord's interposition causes us to glory
   in tribulation! Is not that a cure for worry, a blessed cure for
   anxiety?

   V. Fifthly, a firm conviction of this truth is A QUIETUS AS TO FUTURE
   DREAD. "My times are in Your hand." Do you wish to know what is going
   to happen to you in a short time? Would you look between the folded
   leaves of the future? You can buy a penny newspaper which will tell you
   the fate of nations this very year. But you may be well-near sure that
   nothing will happen which is thus predicted--and thus it may be of
   little use to you! Be content with the prophecies of Scripture, but
   follow not every interpreter of them. Many people would pay great sums
   to have the future made known to them. If they were wise, they would
   rather desire to have it concealed! Do not want to know--such knowledge
   would answer no useful purpose. The future is intended to be a sealed
   book. The present is all we need to have before us. Do your day's work
   in its day and leave tomorrow with your God. If there were ways of
   reading the future, it would be wise to decline to use them. The
   knowledge would create responsibility, arouse fear and diminish present
   enjoyment--why seek after it? Famish idle curiosity and give your
   strength to believing obedience! Of this you may be quite sure, that
   there is nothing in the book of the future which should cause distrust
   to a Believer! Your times are in God's hands--and this secures them.

   The very word, "times," supposes change for you. But as there are no
   changes with God, all is well. Things will happen which you cannot
   foresee, but your Lord has foreseen all and provided for all! Nothing
   can occur without His Divine allowance and He will not permit that
   which would be for your real or permanent injury. "I should like to
   know," says one, "whether I shall die soon." Have no desire in that
   direction--your time will come when it should. The best way to live
   above all fear of death is to die every morning before you leave your
   bedroom. The Apostle Paul said, "I die daily." When you have got into
   the holy habit of daily dying, it will come easy to you to die for the
   last time!

   It is greatly wise to be familiar with our last hours. As you take off
   your garments at night, rehearse the solemn scene when you shall lay
   aside your robe of flesh. When you put on your garments in the morning,
   anticipate the being clothed upon with your house which is from Heaven
   in the day of Resurrection. To be fearful of death is often the height
   of folly. A great Prophet once ran away many miles to escape from death
   by an imperious queen. He was one of the bravest of the brave and yet
   He hurried into solitude to escape a woman's threat! When he had
   finished his weary walk, he sat down and actually prayed, "Let me die."
   It was a singular thing to do, to run for his life, and then to cry,
   "Let me die." That man

   never did die, for we speak of Elijah who rode to Heaven in a chariot
   of fire! God does not answer all His people's prayers, for He has
   better things for them than they ask. Do not tremble about what may
   never happen. Even we may never die, for it is written, "We shall not
   all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling
   of an eye, at the last trump." Some of us may be alive and remain at
   the coming of the Lord. Who knows? Behold, He comes quickly! At any
   rate, do not let us worry about death, for it is in His hands.

   VI. Again, a full conviction that our times are in His hands will be A
   REASON FOR CONSECRATED SERVICE. If God has undertaken my business for
   me, then I may most fitly undertake such business for Him as He may
   appoint. Queen Elizabeth wished one of the leading merchants of London
   to go to Holland to watch her interests there. The honest man told Her
   Majesty that he would obey her commands, but he begged her to remember
   that it would involve the ruin of his own trade, for him to be absent.
   To this the Queen replied, "If you will see to my business, I will see
   to your business." With such a royal promise he might willingly let his
   own business go, for a queen should have it in her power to do more for
   a subject than he can do for himself.

   The Lord, in effect, says to the Believer, "I will take your affairs in
   hand and see them through for you." Will you not at once feel that now
   it is your joy, your delight, to live to glorify your gracious Lord? To
   be set free to serve the Lord is the highest freedom! How beautiful it
   is to read in the book of Isaiah, "And strangers shall stand and feed
   your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your
   vinedressers"! Outsiders shall do the drudgery for you and set you free
   for higher service! Read on and see--"But you shall be named the
   Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God."
   Faith sets us free from the wear and tear of carking care that we may
   give ourselves up wholly to the service of the Lord our God! Faith
   causes us to live exempt from fret, to serve only the blessed God. Set
   free from the burden of earthly things by God's kind care of us, we
   present our bodies as living sacrifices unto the Lord our God. He has
   not made us slaves and drudges, but priests and kings unto God!

   I am sure, dear Friends, if we get this Truth of God fully saturating
   our souls, that our times are in God's hand, it will make life a
   grander thing than it has ever seemed to be. Do you believe that God's
   hand is working with you and for you? Then are you lifted above the
   dumb-driven cattle that surround you, for the God of Heaven thinks of
   you and puts His hand to your affairs. This connection with the Divine
   puts heart into a man and rises him to high endeavor and great belief.
   We feel we are immortal till our work is done! We feel that God is with
   us and that we are bound to be victorious through the blood of Jesus!
   We shall not be defeated in the campaign of life, for the Lord of Hosts
   is with us and we shall tread down our enemies! God will strengthen us,
   for our times are in His hands and, therefore, we will serve Him with
   all our heart and with all our soul, being fully convinced that, "our
   labor is not in vain in the Lord."

   VII. Lastly, if our times are in God's hands, here is A GRAND ARGUMENT
   FOR FUTURE BLESSEDNESS. He that takes care of our times will take care
   of our eternity. He that has brought us so far and worked so graciously
   for us will see us safely over the rest of the road. I marvel at some
   of you older folks, when you begin to doubt. You will say, "Look at
   yourself." Well, so I do, and I am heartily ashamed that ever a grain
   of mistrust should get into the eye of my faith. I would weep it out
   and keep it out for the future.

   Still, some of you are older than I am, for you are 70 or 80 years of
   age. How much longer do you expect to travel in this wilderness? Do you
   think you have you another 10 years? God has been gracious to you for
   70 years and will you fret about the last 10, which, indeed, may never
   come? That will never do! God has delivered some of you out of such
   great trials that your present ones are mere fleabites. Sir Francis
   Drake, after he had sailed around the world, came up the Thames. And
   when he had passed Gravesend there came a storm which threatened the
   ship. The brave commander said, "What? Go around the world safely and
   then get drowned in a ditch? Never!" So we ought to say! God has upheld
   us in great tribulations and we are not going to be cast down about
   trials which are common to men!

   A man of energy, if he takes a work in hand, will push it through and
   the Lord our God never undertakes what he will not complete. "My times
   are in Your hand" and, therefore, the end will be glorious! My Lord, if
   my times were in my own hands, they would prove a failure, but since
   they are in Your hands, You will not fail, nor shall I! The hands of
   God ensures success all along the line. In that day when we shall see
   the tapestry which records our lives, we shall see all the scenes
   therein with wondering eyes. We shall see what wisdom, what love, what
   tenderness, what care was lavished upon them! When once a matter is in
   God's hands, it is never neglected or forgotten, but it is carried out
   to the end. Therefore, comfort one another with these words.

   I have not been able to preach on this text as I hoped to do, for I am
   full of pain and have a heavy headache. But, thank God, I have no
   heartache with such a glorious Truth of God before me! Sweet to my soul
   are these words--"My times are in Your hand." Take the golden sentence
   home with you! Keep this Truth in your mind. Let it lie on your tongue
   like a wafer made with honey. Let it dissolve until your whole nature
   is sweetened by it. Yes, dear old lady, you that have come out of the
   workhouse this morning to hear this sermon, say to yourself, "My times
   are in Your hand." Yes, you, dear Friend, who cannot find employment
   and have been walking your shoes off your feet in the vain endeavor to
   seek one--you, also, may say, "My times are in Your hand." Yes, my dear
   Sister, pining away with consumption, this may be your song--"My times
   are in Your hand." Yes, young man, you that have just started in
   business and have met with a crushing loss, it will be for your
   benefit, after all! Therefore say, "My times are in Your hand." This
   little sentence, to my mind, swells into a hymn--it buds and blossoms
   into a Psalm! Few are the words, but mighty is the sense, and full of
   rest.

   Now, remember, it is not everybody that can find honey in this hive. O
   Sinners, you are in the hands of an angry God and this is terrible! The
   God against whom you continually sin and whom you provoke by refusing
   His Grace, has absolute power over you! Beware, you that forget God,
   lest He tear you in pieces! You have provoked, offended and grieved
   Him, but there is yet hope, for His mercy endures forever. Though you
   have vexed His Holy Spirit, yet return unto Him and He will have mercy
   upon you and abundantly pardon you! It is certain that you are in His
   hands and that you cannot escape from Him. If you should climb to
   Heaven, or dive to Hell, you would not be out of His reach! No strength
   of yours can resist Him, no speed can outrun Him. Yield yourselves to
   God and then this great power of God, which now surrounds you, shall
   become your comfort!

   At present it ought to be your terror. The eyes of God are fixed upon
   you. The hands of God are against you and if you are unsaved, one touch
   of that hand will mean death and everlasting destruction! That hand
   which the Believer devoutly kisses, is the hand which you may well
   dread. Oh, that you would flee to Christ Jesus and find shelter from
   wrath beneath the crimson canopy of His precious blood! Amen.

"Am I A Sea, Or A Whale?"

   (No. 2206)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 31, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH AND
   FOREIGN SAILORS' SOCIETY, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 7, 1891.

   "Am I a sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over me?" Job 7:12.

   JOB was in great pain when he thus bitterly complained. These moans
   came from him when his skin was broken and had become loathsome and he
   sat upon a dunghill and scraped himself with a potsherd. We are amazed
   at his patience, but we are not amazed at his impatience! He had fits
   of complaining and failed in that very patience for which he was noted.
   Where God's saints are most glorious, there you will find their spots.
   The weaknesses of the saints lie near their strength. Elijah is the
   bravest of the brave and flees from Jezebel. Moses is the meekest of
   the meek and speaks in passion. Job is the most patient of men and
   cries, "I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my
   spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul." As part of his
   bitter complaint, he asks, "Am I a sea, or a whale, that You set a
   watch over me?"

   He seemed to be watched and whipped--and then watched again. It seemed
   to him that God concentrated all His strength upon him in afflicting
   him. He was beaten black and blue and, whereas, other culprits had 40
   stripes save one, he had 50 stripes save none! He was spared no
   suffering and, he cries at last, "I am watched, and checked, as if I
   were a great sea needing always to be held in bounds or a terrible sea
   monster needing always a hook in its jaws. Lord, why do You harass me
   thus? I am such a poor, insignificant thing, that it seems out of Your
   usual way to be so rough upon one so feeble. The raging ocean, or the
   mighty leviathan may need such watching, but why do You spend it on me?
   Am I a sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over me?"

   I shall not moor myself to Job's sense of the words, but I shall spread
   my sail for a voyage further out to sea. This sort of talk may have
   been used by many a man who is now within hail of my voice--may have
   been used by sailors now before me.

   Let me point out the channel along which I shall steer in my discourse.
   We shall begin by saying that some men seem to be narrowly watched by
   God. They think that the Lord's eyes are as much fixed on them as
   though they were great as a sea, or huge as a whale. My second point
   will be that they do not like this watching. They complain about it and
   wish they could get rid of it. Therefore they argue with God against
   it. Our third head is that their argument is a bad one. They think they
   are very harshly treated, but the fact is that all they complain of is
   in love. See, my messmates, the way I shall try to steer, but if the
   heavenly wind blows me out of my course, don't be surprised if I tack
   about and go, nobody knows where!

   I. I have, first, to say that SOME MEN SEEM TO BE ESPECIALLY TRACKED
   AND WATCHED BY GOD. We hear of persons being "shadowed" by the
   police--and certain people feel as if they were shadowed by God--they
   are mysteriously tracked by the great Spirit and they know and feel it.
   Wherever they go, an eye is upon them and they cannot hide from it.
   They are like prisoners under arrest--they can never go out of reach of
   the law. They cannot get away from God, do what they may! There are men
   who have been in this condition for years and they know what I mean.

   All men are really surrounded by God. He is not far from everyone of
   us. "In Him we live, move and have our being." "Where shall we flee
   from Your Presence?" To the heights above, or to the depths beneath? To
   oceans frozen into ice, or seas where the sun shines with burning heat?
   In vain we rise or dive to escape from God. "You, God, see me," is as

   true in the watches of the night as in the blaze of day. God is with us
   and we are always beneath His eyes. Yet there are certain people to
   whom this is more clear than it is to others.

   Some are singularly aware of the Presence of God. Certain of us never
   were without a sense of God. As children, we could not go to sleep till
   we said, "Our Father which are in Heaven." As youths, we trembled if we
   heard God's holy name blasphemed. As men, engaged in the cares of life,
   we have seen the Lord's goodness, all along. We delight to see Him in
   every flower that blooms and to hear His voice in every wind that
   blows. It has made us happy to see God in His works. "The fool has said
   in his heart, No God," but this folly we never cared for. We knew that
   God was good even when we felt we had offended Him. He has taught us
   from our youth and manifested Himself to us. Softly has the whisper
   fallen on our ear, "God is near you. God is with you. God has an ear to
   hear you. God has a heart to love you. God has a hand to help you." I
   have known those who, even when they have sinned and gone against their
   consciences, have never at any time quite lost a sense of the nearness
   of God even though its only fruit was fear--a fear which has torment!

   With others, God's watch is seen in a different way. They feel that
   they are watched by God because their conscience never ceases to rebuke
   them. The voice of conscience is not pitched to the same key in all
   men, neither is it equally loud in all people. Conscience can be made
   like a muzzled dog and then it cannot bite the thief of sin. Conscience
   can grow like a man with a cold who has lost his voice. But it is not
   so with all men, even after years of sin. Some have a naturally tender
   conscience and, while living in sin, they are never easy. They make
   merry all the day, for, "they count it one of the wisest things to
   drive dull care away"--but dull care, like the chickens, comes home to
   roost at night! The sailor in company is jolly, but if he has to keep a
   lone watch beneath the silent stars, his heart begins to beat and his
   conscience begins to call him to account for the follies of the day. He
   starts in his sleep--he dreams over his past sin and the judgment to
   come-- for conscience will wake even when the rest of the man sleeps.
   "You were wrong," says conscience, and his voice is very solemn.

   Even great sin in certain men has not prevented Conscience speaking out
   honestly to them. Again and again the inward monitor cries, "You were
   wrong and you will suffer for it." We read that, "David's heart smote
   him"--the heart deals us an ugly knock. When the blow is within us, it
   tells. I am addressing some who, though they do not feel pleased about
   it, yet must know that there is a something within that will not let
   them sin cheaply. God has a bit in their mouths and a bridle upon their
   jaws--and every now and then He gives a tug at it and pulls them right
   up. They are not at home in sin! They have not yet got their sea legs
   upon the ocean of vice. They sing the songs of the devil with a quake
   and a shake which shows that the music does not suit them! Thus God has
   set a watch upon them--they carry a detective in their bosoms.

   In some this watching has gone farther, for they are under solemn
   conviction of sin. They are convinced of sin, of righteousness and of
   judgment to come. God's custom-house officer has boarded them and their
   smuggling is found out. I remember when I was in that state, myself--a
   criminal who dared not deny his guilt, but dreaded punishment. I would
   not go back to that condition for a hundred worlds! There was no rest
   for me then. I was only a youth, but boyish sports lost their relish
   for me because I knew that I was a sinner and that God must punish sin.
   I awoke in the morning and my first act for many a day was to read a
   chapter of the Bible, or a page of some awakening book which kept my
   conscience still awake. The Holy Spirit put me in irons and there I lay
   both day and night! My bed was, at times, a very weary place for me,
   because the eyes of God's anger seemed to be always watching me. I knew
   I had offended God and I had not yet found out the way of
   reconciliation by the blood of Jesus Christ.

   Now, it may be that I speak to some here who have been to the ends of
   the earth and they have said, "Well, when we get away where the Sabbath
   bell is never heard, we shall get rid of these fears and take our swing
   in sin." They sailed off and as soon as they reached port, they hurried
   to a place of vicious amusement--where no one knew them. But the dog of
   fear howled at their heels and merriment seemed mockery to them. On the
   lone ocean the very stars pierced their hearts with their rays. At
   length their messmates began to notice it and call them Old Sobersides.
   "Jack, what ails you?" was the frequent question, and well it might be,
   for Jack was very heavy and it is hard to be merry with a broken heart!
   In some such fashion as this the man feels that God has set a watch
   upon him and that he has become like a sea which never rests, or a
   whale which roams the waste of water and knows no home. God watched him
   and though he would gladly have run the blockade, he could not find an
   hour in which his vessel was left alone.

   Certain men are not only plagued by conscience and dogged by fear, but
   the Providence of God seems to have gone out against them. Just when
   the man had resolved to have a bout of drinking, he fell sick of a
   fever and had to go to the hospital. He was going to a dance, but he
   became so weak that he had not a leg to stand upon. He was forced to
   toss to and fro on bed--to quite another tune from that which pleases
   the ballroom! He had yellow fever and was long in pulling round. God
   watched him and put the skid on him just as he meant to have a
   breakneck run downhill! The man gets better and he says to himself, "I
   will have a good time, now." But then he is out of berth and perhaps he
   cannot get a ship for months--and he is brought down to poverty. "Dear
   me!" he says, "everything goes against me. I am a marked man!" And so
   he is. Just when he thinks that he is going to have a fair wind, a
   tempest comes on and drives him out of his course, and he sees rocks
   ahead. After a while he thinks, "Now I am all right. Jack is himself,
   again, and piping times have come." A storm hurries up; the ship goes
   down and he loses all but the clothes he has on his back. He is in a
   wretched plight--a shipwrecked mariner far from home. God seems to
   pursue him even as He did Jonah!

   He carries with him misfortune for others and he might well cry, "Am I
   a sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over me?" Nothing prospers. His
   tacklings are loosed. He cannot well strengthen his mast; his ship
   leaks; his sails are torn; his yards are snapped and he cannot
   understand it. Other people seem to get on, though they are worse than
   he is. Time was when he used to be lucky, too--but now he has parted
   company with success and carries the black flag of distress. He is
   driven to and fro by contrary winds. He makes no headway. He is a
   miserable man and would wish that the whole thing would go to the
   bottom, only he dreads a place which has no bottom, from which there is
   no escape, if once you sink into it. The Providence of God runs hard
   against him and thus he sees himself to be a watched man.

   Yes, and God also watches over many in the way of admonition. Wherever
   they go, holy warnings follow them. They cannot escape from those who
   would be friends to their souls. They seem to be surrounded with a ring
   of prayers and sermons and holy talks. The boy said, "If I could get
   away from my mother, I should be free! I have been tied long enough to
   her apron strings. I am old enough to do as I like. If I can get away
   from my father's chidings and prayers, I shall have a fine time of it."
   So the boy ran away and went to sea--and when he got on board, a good
   old sailor tackled him--and talked to him about his soul! And then
   another pleaded with him. The boy said to himself, "Why, I have got out
   of the frying pan into the fire! I came here to be out of the way of
   religion and here it is!"

   I have known a sailor to go from port to port, and wherever he has
   landed there has been some gracious man or woman waiting to lead him to
   Christ. May it be often so! May the Bethel flag be found flying in all
   waters, till every runaway says, "Why, I am watched wherever I go!" May
   it be as it was with our dear friends, Fullerton and Smith, on board
   the steamboat! Mr. Fullerton spoke to a rough man and asked him if he
   was saved. And the man was angry, cross, vexed and went to the other
   side of the vessel. There he complained to Mr. Smith, "That man over
   there asked me if I was saved; he is a fool!" "Very likely," said
   Smith, "but then, you see, he is a fool for Christ. I think it is
   better to be a fool for Jesus than to be wise for the devil." He began
   to plead with the sailor, when the man cried out, "There is a regular
   gang of them! I cannot go anywhere but they are on to me."

   It has been made hot for some of you by the British and Foreign
   Sailors' Society which has placed missionaries in so many ports.
   "There's a gang of them," and wherever you go, you stumble on an
   earnest Christian man who will not let you alone. If I could stir up
   Christian people here, I would make it hard for sinners, so that
   wherever they went they would find a hand outstretched to stop them
   from going to destruction! Oh, that each one might be met with tears
   and entreaties, that thus each one might be snatched from the waves of
   fire and landed on the rock of salvation! Some here present have had to
   dodge a great deal to keep out of the way of Gospel shots. Their track
   has been followed by mercy and they have been pursued by swift cruisers
   of Grace. They have been like fish taken in a net--surrounded on all
   sides-- and neither able to pass through the meshes, nor to break the
   net, nor to leap out of it! Oh, that the net of Christ's love may so
   entangle you all, that you may be His forever!

   That is our first point--there are some men who seem especially watched
   of God.

   II. Secondly, we notice that THEY ARE VERY APT TO DISLIKE THIS
   WATCHING. Job is not pleased with it.

   He asks, "Am I a sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over me?" These
   people, to whom God pays such attention, are foolish enough to murmur
   that they are so hedged in and they are vexed to be made to feel that
   God has His eyes upon them.

   Do you know what they would like? They want liberty to sin! They would
   like to be let loose and to be allowed to do just as their wild wills
   would suggest to them. They would cast off every restraint and have
   their fling of what the world calls "pleasure." They would climb from
   sin to sin, hand over hand. They would like to empty all the cups on
   the devil's sideboard and be as merry as the worst of men when they are
   taking it free and easy. That is why they would send their consciences
   to sleep, drown their fears and escape from chastening Providences and
   warning admonitions. They would like to live where no Christian would
   ever worry them again with wearisome exhortation! They demand
   liberty--liberty to put their hands into the fire! Liberty to ruin
   themselves! Liberty to leap into Hell before their time! Liberty! What
   destruction has been worked in your name! Free thinking! Free living!
   Free loving and all that! What misuse of terms! What a libel upon the
   name of freedom, to use the word, "free," in connection with the
   slavery of sin! Yet, I am speaking to some who say, "That is just what
   I want! I want to cut myself clear of all this hamper which blocks me
   up from having my own way." Ah me! This is the cry of a man who is bent
   on soul-suicide!

   They also wish that they could be as hard of heart as many others are.
   Some men can drink any quantity and yet do not seem as if they were
   greatly affected by it. And many a young sailor has wished that he
   could pour down his grog without a wink, after the style of the old
   toper. He meets with a foul-mouthed being who can swear till all is
   blue, while he himself has only dropped an oath or two, and then felt
   wretched. The young man begins to wish that he was as tough as old
   Jack, and as much a daredevil as he. The hardened profligate is
   foolishly envied and looked upon as a man of "pluck." But is it true
   bravery to ruin one's soul? Is it manly to be wicked? Is it a great
   gain to have a seared conscience? We don't envy the blind because they
   cannot see danger, nor the deaf because they cannot hear an alarm--why
   envy the hardened old sinner because he has become spiritually blind
   and deaf?

   There are monsters, both on land and on sea, whose very breath is
   pestilent and whose talk is enough to choke up a town with vice. And
   yet certain young men, whom God will not allow to descend into such
   rottenness, are almost angry that they are restrained! A tender
   conscience is a great possession, but these simple ones know not its
   value. They wish that they could have a heart as hard as the nether
   millstone. Ah, poor souls! You know not what you wish, for you have no
   idea how deep is the curse that lies in a callous conscience! When God
   gave Pharaoh up to hardness of heart, it was a tremendous punishment
   for his pride and cruelty and, short of Hell, there is no judgment that
   God can inflict like letting a man have his own way! "Let him alone,"
   says God, "he is joined to idols." And if the Lord says that, there is
   only one other word more dreadful--and that is the final
   sentence--"Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
   for the devil and his angels." O you beginners in vice who cannot yet
   stifle the cries of your suffering consciences, I pray that you may see
   your folly and no longer do violence to your own mercy!

   Men do not like this being surrounded by God--this wearing the bit and
   kicking strap--because they would drop God from their thoughts. If
   tomorrow we could hear, by telegram from Heaven, that God was dead,
   what crowds would buy the newspaper! It would be the greatest relief in
   the world to many a godless wretch if he could feel sure that there was
   no God! To some of us this news would be death--we would have lost our
   Father, our Comforter, our Savior, our All! Alas, many wish that there
   were no God, and if they cannot persuade themselves that there is
   none--and it is very hard for a sailor to do that--yet they try to
   forget Him. If God is out of mind, He is as good as out of the world to
   the careless sinner.

   When God comes with inward fears and awakens conscience--and sends
   cross Providences, so that the man feels pulled up and made to
   pause--then he knows that there is a God, for he feels a Power which
   works against his sin from which he cannot get away. He longs to be
   clear of this secret force, but it wraps him about on every side. He
   does not read his Bible and yet Scripture rises in his memory! It is
   long since he bent his knee in prayer--he has almost forgotten what his
   mother said to him when she lay dying--but still he feels that there is
   a God and, somehow, that belief sounds a trumpet blast through his
   soul, summoning him to his last account. Come to judgment! Come to
   judgment! Come to judgment! The call rings in his ears and he cannot
   get away from the terrible sound! Then it is that he cries "Why am I
   thus? Am I a sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over me?"

   Once more, there are some who do not like to be shadowed in this way
   because they want to have their will with others. Shall I speak a sharp
   word, like a two-edged sword? There are men--and seamen to be found
   among them--who are not satisfied with being ruined, themselves, but
   they thirst to ruin others! They lay traps for precious souls and they
   are vexed that their victims should escape them. They are angry because
   certain poor women are not altogether in their power.

   Woe unto the men who lead women astray! I have heard of sailors who, in
   every port they enter, try to ruin others. I charge you to remember
   that you will have to face these ruined ones at the Day of Judgement!
   You sailed away and they never knew where you went, but the Lord knew.
   It may be, when you lie in Hell, eyes will find you out and a voice
   will cry aloud, "Are you here? You are the man that led me to
   Perdition!"

   You will have to keep everlasting company with those whom you dragged
   down to Hell--and these will, forever, curse you to your face. I say
   there are men who would like to have full license to commit wantonness
   and they are grieved that they are hindered in their carnival of sin!
   May God grant that you may be stopped altogether and, instead of
   lusting to pollute others, may you have a desire to save them! May God
   grant that the channel of evil may be blocked for you and may you be
   piloted into the waters of repentance and faith!

   This is why some kick against God. I fear these people will be much
   vexed with me for speaking so plainly, but you must not think that it
   will alarm me should you be angry. I am rather glad when fellows get
   angry with my preaching. "Oh," I say to myself, "those fish feel the
   hook in their jaws and so they struggle to escape." Of course a fish
   does not like the hook which lays hold of him! But these angry hearers
   will come again. You people with whom the sermon goes in at one ear and
   out at the other, you get no good, whatever--but a man who fires up
   with wrath and says, "How dare that fellow speak thus to me?" is sure
   to listen again--and it is very likely that God will bless him. But
   whether it offends you or pleases you--I repeat my warning--I charge
   you, do not drag others down to Hell with you! If you must go there
   yourselves, seek not to destroy those around you! Do not teach boys to
   drink and to swear. Neither tempt frail women to commit uncleanness
   with you. God help you to shake off all vice, for I know that vile
   habits are often the reason why men kick against the restraint of God's
   loving hand.

   III. And now I have got to the very heart of my text. The third part is
   this--that THIS ARGUMENT AGAINST THE LORD'S DEALINGS IS A VERY BAD ONE.
   Job says, "Am I a sea, or whale, that You set a watch over me?" Listen!
   To argue from our insignificance is poor pleading, for the little
   things are just those against which there is most need to watch! If you
   were a sea, or a whale, God might leave you alone, but as you are a
   feeble and sinful creature who can do more hurt than a sea, or a whale,
   you need constant watching! In life, men fall by very little things.
   One does not need to watch against his dog one half as much as against
   a horsefly, or a mosquito, for these will sting you when you least
   expect it. The little things need most watching, therefore it is poor
   reasoning when we complain that God watches us as if we were a sea, or
   a whale.

   After all, there is not a man here who is not much like a sea, or a sea
   monster in this respect, that he needs a watch to be set over him. A
   man's heart is as changeable and as deceitful as the sea. Today it is
   calm as a sea of glass, unruffled by a breath of air. Oh, trust not
   yourself upon it, for before tomorrow's sun is up, your nature may be
   rolling in tremendous billows of passion! You cannot trust the sea, but
   it is more worthy of confidence than your heart! Here you are, tonight,
   and oh, how good you look as you sit and listen and then stand up and
   sing! Ah, my men! I should not like to hear you if you take to
   blaspheming your Maker, as many do! When you are down in the forecastle
   with a little band of praying men, how very good you feel! Let us see
   you when you are on shore and there is plenty of grog about. It is easy
   to have a calm sea when there is no wind, but how different is the
   ocean when a gale is blowing! We are all very well when far away from
   temptation, but how are we when the devil's servants are around us?
   Then, I fear, that too often good resolutions prove to be--

   "False as the smooth, deceitful sea, And empty as the whistling wind."
   It may be that I speak to one who has undergone a dreadful change. Once
   you led others in the way of righteousness, but now you draw them into
   evil. Once you sailed under the Bethel flag, but now the old Pirate of
   the infernal lake is your captain. You have gone back to your old ways
   and have again become the slave of the world, the flesh and the devil.
   Your religious profession had no foundation. Ah me, you need not say,
   "Am I a sea, or a whale?" for seas and sea monsters are more to be
   trusted than you are! The sea is immeasurable and, as for you, your
   sinfulness is unsearchable. Your capacity is almost without
   measure--your mind reaches far and touches all things. Man's mind can
   rise in rebellion against the God of the whole earth, till, like the
   raging waves of the sea, it threatens to put out the lights of Heaven!
   When man is in a rebellious state he will rage in his thoughts as
   though he would wash away the shores of Heaven and beat like the surf
   upon the iron rocks of Hell. A man is an awful mystery of iniquity when
   left to himself. You cannot

   fathom his pride, nor measure his daring. Deep down in his mind there
   are innumerable creeping things, both small and great beasts--for all
   manner of evils and sins multiply in the heart like fishes in the sea!
   Do not ask, "Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that You set a watch over
   me?" for the Lord may answer, "You are more capacious for evil than a
   sea and more wild than a sea monster."

   I shall now go further and show that, by reason of our evil nature, we
   have become like the sea. This is true in several ways, for, first, the
   sea is restless and so is our nature. "The wicked are like the troubled
   sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt." You need
   not go far to find hearts always agitated, always seeking rest and
   finding none. They know not Christ and, until they do know Him, they
   cannot rest. They are always seeking a something--they know not what.
   They run first in one direction and then in another, but they never
   follow the right thing. When they are thoughtful, no good comes of
   their thoughts. Their waters cast up--what? Pearls and corals?
   No--"mire and dirt." I do not need to explain those words. If any of
   you have to keep company with these restless beings, you know how
   foul-mouthed they can be. They cast up worse things than mire and dirt
   when they are stirred up. Oh, say not, "Am I a sea, or a whale?" Think
   of yourself as being as restless as a whale when the harpoon is in
   him--as restless as the sea when a storm is moving its lowest depths.

   Let us say, next, that the sea can be furious and terrible--and so can
   ungodly men. When a man is in a fury, what a wild beast he can be! A
   landsman looks on the sea when it has put on its best behavior and he
   says, "I should not mind going on a voyage. It must be splendid to
   steam over such a sea! I feel I shall make a splendid sailor." Let him
   look at that same ocean, by-and-by. Where is the sea of glass, now?
   Where are the gentle waves which seemed afraid to ripple too far upon
   the sand? The sea roars and rages and raves. The Atlantic in a storm is
   terrible, but have you ever seen a tempest in a man's nature? It is an
   awful sight and one which causes gracious eyes to weep! What a
   miserable object is a man with the drink in him! He was as decent a
   fellow as one could talk with, but now that the drink has mastered him,
   the devil has come on board and you will do well to give him a wide
   berth. The same is true of passion. Concerning angry men our advice
   would be, "Put not to sea in a storm, neither argue with a man in a
   passion." You do not know what he will do, and he does not know,
   himself! Such a man will be grieved enough when he sobers down, but
   meanwhile, while the storm is on, he cares for nothing. His eyes flash
   lightning, his face is black as tempest, his mouth foams and his tongue
   rages. In his case, "The sea roars and the fullness thereof." When you
   feel the Lord's restraint, you need not ask, "Am I a sea, or a whale?"
   for your own heart may answer, "You can be more furious than the sea
   itself."

   Think, again, how unsatisfied is the sea. It draws down and swallows up
   stretches of land and thousands of tons of cliff, but it is not filled
   up. "All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full." Huge
   Spanish galleons went to the bottom, with thousands of gold and silver
   pieces on board--but the sea was never the richer. When, on some
   dreadful night, our coasts are strewn with wrecks and hundreds of lives
   are lost, the devouring deep is never the more satisfied. The sea is a
   hungry monster which could swallow a navy and then open its mouth for
   more! Are not many men made of the same craving sort? If you gave them
   half a world, they would cry for the other half, and if they had the
   whole round globe, they would weep for the stars! Man's mind never
   rests in sweet content till God, Himself, satisfies it with Himself. O
   man, without true religion it is your fate to go hungry and thirsty
   forever, or, like the sea, yeasting and foaming after you know not
   what!

   Human nature is like the sea for mischief. How destructive is the ocean
   and how unfeeling! It makes widows and orphans by the thousands--and
   then smiles as if it had done nothing! Terrible havoc it can work when
   once its power is let loose! Do not talk of the destructiveness of the
   sea--let the reckless sinner think of the destructiveness of his own
   life! You that are living in sin and vice, what wrecks you have caused!
   How many who set out on the voyage of life and bade fair to make a
   splendid passage, have gone upon the rocks through you! A foul word, a
   loose song, a filthy act and a frivolous craft has become a wreck!
   Conscience can fill in the details. Ah me, one cannot say to God, "Am I
   a sea, or a sea monster?" or He might well reply, "No shark has
   devoured so many as the drunkard in his cups, the swearer in his
   presumption and the unclean in his lust!" Ah me, I could weep to think
   how much of mischief any one of you who are unconverted may yet do! The
   Lord deliver you from being left derelict, to cause wreck to others!

   We must not forget that we are less obedient to God than the sea is.
   Nothing keeps back the sea from many a shore but a belt of sand--and
   though it rages in storm and tempest, the sea goes back in due time and
   leaves the sand for children to play upon. It knows its bounds and
   keeps them. When the time comes for the tide to rise, the obedient
   waters march

   upon the shore in unbroken ranks and fill up every creek. They do not
   linger behind their time. When the moment comes to stay where they are,
   they rest at flood. Then comes the instant to begin the ebb and, no
   matter how boisterous the waves may be, they fall back at God's
   bidding. What, after all, is more orderly than the great sea? Would to
   God we were like it in this! How readily this great creature yields! A
   little wind springs up and its waves answer at once to the breath of
   Heaven. When the sun crosses the line, the equinoctial gales know their
   season, while at all times the great currents cease not the flow which
   God has appointed them.

   The sea is obedient to the Lord and so was that great fish of which we
   read just now--"The Lord spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
   upon the dry land." As for us, we refuse to obey! And when left to
   ourselves, what law can restrain us? Is there anything in Heaven or
   earth which a proud sinner will not venture to attempt? God blocks up
   the road to Hell with hedge, ditch and chain--but we break them all! He
   digs a trench across our way and we leap over it. He piles a mountain
   in the road and as if our feet were like hinds' feet, we leap upon the
   high places of presumption! A man will go against wind and tide in his
   determination to be lost! O Sea! O Sea! You are but a child with your
   father compared to the wicked and rebellious heart of man! It is a bad
   argument, then. We need to be looked after. We need to be watched. We
   need to be kept in check even more than a sea or a whale! We need the
   restraining Providence and constraining Grace of God to keep us from
   deadly sin.

   IV. Last of all, I would remark that ALL THEY COMPLAINED OF WAS SENT IN
   LOVE. They said, "Am I a sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over
   me?" but if they had known the truth, they would have blessed God with
   all their hearts for having watched over them as He has done.

   First, God's restraint of some of us has kept us from self-ruin. If the
   Lord had not held us in, we might have been in prison! We might have
   been in the grave! We might have been in Hell! Who knows what would
   have become of us? An old Scotchman said to Mr. Rowland Hill what, I am
   quite sure, would have been as true of me. He looked into Mr. Hill's
   face so keenly and so often that at last good Rowland asked him, "Why
   are you looking at my face so much?" "I was thinking," said the
   Scotchman, "that if you had not been converted by the Grace of God, you
   would have been a terrible sinner." And, surely, this would have been
   my case. Nothing half-and-half would have contented me. I would have
   gone to the end of my tether.

   Is not the same true of some of you? How many times has the Lord laid
   His own hand on us to stay us from a fatal step! If we were checked in
   our youth and brought, then and there, to Jesus, it was a gracious deed
   on God's part. If we have been hindered during a sinful manhood and
   have, at length, been made to bow before the will of the Lord, this,
   also, is great Grace. Left to ourselves, we would have chosen our own
   destruction! Do you not think that God's taking you apart and giving
   you a tender conscience--and admonishing you so often--proves His great
   love to you! Surely someone has prayed for you! There is a mother here
   tonight. I hope she will not mind my telling you what she did last
   Tuesday when I was sitting in my vestry. She brought me a little brown
   paper parcel with £50 in it and she gave it for the British and Foreign
   Sailors' Society. She has a son whom she has not heard of for years. He
   went to sea and she cannot find him, or get any tidings of his
   whereabouts. But she hopes that a missionary of this Society may meet
   him in some strange place and bring him to the Savior.

   She prays that it may be so and, therefore, she brings her
   self-sacrificing offering--a great sum, I am sure, for her-- that she
   may help to support the good Society which, she hopes, may be a
   blessing to her boy. There are other sailors to whom God's love is seen
   in their being followed up by a mother's pleading. Ah, Friend, the Lord
   would not have checked you so if He had not intended to bless you! That
   broken leg of yours is to keep you from running too far into sin. That
   yellow fever was sent to cool the fever of your sin. Your missing that
   ship caused you to miss shipwreck and death. These mishaps were all
   tokens of love to you. The Lord would not let you perish! He resolves
   to save you. You are one of His chosen. Christ bought you with His
   blood and He means to have you for His own. If you will not come to Him
   with a gentle breeze, He will fetch you by a storm! Yield to the
   pressure of His love. If you will be as the horse and the mule which
   have no understanding, He will break you in and manage you with bit and
   bridle--but it would be far better if you would be ruled by love.

   I think I see tokens of electing love upon you in those very things
   which you have kicked against. The Lord is working to bring you to
   Himself, and to Himself you must come. The prodigal son was driven home
   by stress of weather. If his father had had the doing of it, he could
   not have worked the matter better! His hungry belly and his pig-feeding
   fetched

   him home. The unkindness of the citizens of the far country helped to
   hurry him back to his father. Hardship, need and pain are meant to
   bring you back--and God has used them to that end! And the day will
   come when you will say, "I bless God for the rough wave which washed me
   on shore. I bless God for the stormy Providence which drowned my
   comfort, but saved my soul."

   Once more and I have done. God will not always deal roughly with you.
   Perhaps tonight He will say His last sharp word. Will you yield to
   softer means? They say that oil poured on troubled waters will make
   them smooth--God the Holy Spirit can send to your troubled soul a
   lifelong calm! The winds and waves on the Galilean sea all went to
   sleep in an instant. How? Why, when Jesus came walking on the water, He
   said to the warring elements, "Be still." The waves crouched like
   whipped dogs at His feet, though they had, just before, roared like
   lions! He said to the winds, "Hush!" and they breathed as softly as the
   lips of a babe! Jesus is here at this hour. He that died on Calvary
   looks down on us-- believe on Him! He lifts His pierced hands and
   cries, "Look unto Me, and be you saved!" Will you not look to Him? Oh,
   that His Grace may lead you at once to say, "He is All in All to me!"

   Here is a soul-saving text for you--"God so loved the world, that He
   gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life." Accept the Savior and though you
   are as a sea, or as a whale, you shall no longer complain of the Lord's
   watching you, but you shall rejoice in perfect liberty! He is free who
   loves to serve his God! He makes it his delight that he is watched of
   the Lord. The Lord bless sailors! May we all meet in the Fair Havens!
   May the flag of your Society bless every sea because God blesses its
   missionaries! I wish for it the utmost prosperity and I judge it to be
   worthy of the most generous aid of all Christians. In all respects it
   is exactly to my mind. The Lord send prosperity to it! Amen.

Redemption Through Blood--The Gracious Forgiveness Of Sins

   (No. 2207)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 7, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON

   "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
   according to the riches of His Grace." Ephesians 1:7.

   READ the chapter and carefully note how the Apostle goes to the back of
   everything and commences with those primeval blessings which were ours
   before time began. He dwells on the Divine love of old and the
   predestination which came out of it--and all that blessed purpose of
   making us holy and without blame before Him in love, which was
   comprehended in the Covenant of Grace. It does us good to get back to
   these antiquities--to these eternal things. You shake off something of
   the dust of time, as you no longer walk down its restless ages, but
   traverse the glorious eternity where centuries seem no more than fallen
   leaves by the way. Thousands of years are less than a drop of a bucket
   compared with the lifetime of the Almighty! How sublime a thing to
   climb, in contemplation, to the everlasting God and the eternal council
   chamber--and to see the heart of love beating towards the chosen people
   before all time--and the infinite mind of God devising and purposing
   their good! This is an exceedingly great refreshment and the wonder is
   that so few Believers dare to ascend this sublime hill of the Lord,
   there to commune with Him who Was and Is, and is to come!

   After the Apostle had briefly touched upon that subject, he then began
   to speak of present blessings--matters of actual experience--and he
   commenced by saying, "In whom we have redemption." The Grace of the
   eternal past is a matter of faith, but here is something which is
   within our grasp and enjoyment. The other we believe, but this we
   actually and literally receive. "We have redemption through His blood,
   the forgiveness of sins."

   And here let me say what a charming thing it is to deal with
   experimental divinity--not with theories, but with matters of
   fact--great facts which are dear to you because they have been worked
   in you, and you have not been merely a delighted spectator of them, but
   you have been the subject and object of them! "In whom we have
   redemption." Whether others have it or not, we have "redemption through
   His blood, the forgiveness of sins." We do not hope for it, but we have
   it. We do not merely think so, but we know that we have it. We are
   redeemed! We are free from bondage! We are forgiven and are no longer
   under condemnation!

   At this time, as God shall help me, I shall dwell upon the forgiveness
   of sins. We have not time to plunge into the deeps of the eternal
   purpose, nor even to dive into the full Doctrine of Redemption, but, as
   the swallow with his wing touches the brook and then is up and away, so
   must it be with my thoughts at this time--a mere touch of the river of
   the Water of Life will be a blessing to myself and, as I cast a little
   spray over you, I hope it will refresh you, also. May the Holy Spirit
   help our meditation!

   I. The first observation, taken distinctly from the text, is this--THAT
   THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS IS A GRAND BLESSING. The Apostle has mentioned
   it, if you notice, among the great things of God--His electing love,
   His adoption of us by Jesus Christ, His acceptance of us in the
   Beloved. Side by side with these colossal mercies, he puts this one,
   that we have "the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His
   Grace." This is a blessing of no mean stature, for it marches with the
   giants of Election and Adoption. Let it stand prominently out before us
   at this time.

   What is this "forgiveness of sins"? Too often, in popular talk, it is
   supposed that the chief and main thought of the forgiven sinner is that
   he has escaped from Hell. Salvation means much more than this and what
   it further means is too much kept in the background, but yet I will
   begin with rescue from punishment, for if sin is pardoned, the penalty
   is extinguished. It would not be possible for God to forgive and yet to
   punish. That would be a forgiveness quite unworthy of God. It would,
   indeed, be no forgiveness at all! We are certain that the everlasting
   punishment of sin declared in Scrip-

   ture will never happen to the man who is forgiven. When transgression
   is removed, the soul stands clear at the bar of God, and there can be
   no further penalty. "I absolve you," says the great Judge--and that
   carries with it weight, so that a man that is forgiven is cleared of
   the punishment which he must otherwise have borne. "Blessed is he whose
   transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered." "There is therefore
   now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."

   Yet Divine favor restored is a still brighter result of forgiveness to
   many. Speaking from my own experience, while I was under conviction of
   sin I had less apprehension of the punishment of sin than I had of sin,
   itself. I do not know that I very frequently trembled at the thought of
   Hell--I did so whenever it came before my mind. But when I was in the
   hands of the Holy Spirit, as a Spirit of bondage convincing me of sin,
   my great trouble was that God was angry with me-- properly and rightly
   so. I mourned that I had offended my Maker, that I had grieved the
   living God, that I had sinned against His righteous will and that I
   could not rejoice in His favor, nor sun myself in His smile. I felt
   that it was right on the part of the holy God to be displeased with me.
   I believe that the great joy of forgiveness, to the Believer, is that
   God has taken away His anger from him. That sweet hymn, which we often
   sing, is a paraphrase of a passage in Isaiah--

   "I will praise You every day, Now Your anger's turned away; Comfortable
   thoughts arise From the bleeding Sacrifice." "Though You were angry
   with me, Your anger is turned away and You comforted me."

   Forgiveness means this among men. A person has grieved and wronged me.
   I feel hurt in my mind about it. When I forgive him, I no longer feel
   grieved or angry with him--I think of him as before--and we are on good
   terms. If my forgiveness is genuine--and in God's case it is
   emphatically so--then there is no resentment left. The offense is as
   though it had never been committed. I say to the person who did me
   wrong, "I take a sponge and I wipe it all off the slate. Give me your
   hand, let us stand as we stood before." The pardon of sin by God is
   after such a fashion. He blots out the sin as the Oriental erases with
   his pencil the record made upon his waxen tablet so that no trace of it
   remains. He smiles where otherwise he must have frowned. He gives
   complacent love where otherwise there must have been indignation and
   wrath. Do you not think that this is the sweetest way of looking at the
   forgiveness of sin? If you are, at this time, under legal work, feeling
   the tortures of a guilty conscience, you will appreciate such a pardon
   very highly. In the case of the poor penitent prodigal, it was the kiss
   of his father's lips, it was his restoration to his father's heart, it
   was the cheering words of his father's love that constituted to him the
   sweetest fragrance of the rose of forgiveness. Yes, the Lord Jesus
   Christ has come, that we poor guilty ones may be restored to the favor
   of God and walk consciously in the light of His Countenance because sin
   is removed!

   This pardon of sin, being of this full and sweet character, involving
   both the reversal of the penalty of sin and the ending of the distance
   that intervened between us and God, brings with it the removal of much
   distress and sorrow from the heart! I do not think that there can be
   any grief outside of Hell that is more terrible to bear than the wounds
   of conscience. We read that, "David's heart smote him" and, believe me,
   the heart can smite as with an iron mace and smite where the bruise is
   intensely felt. Give me into the power of a roaring lion, but never let
   me come under the power of an awakened, guilty conscience! Yes, shut me
   up in a dark dungeon, among all manner of loathsome creatures--snakes
   and reptiles of all kinds--but, oh, give me not over to my own thoughts
   when I am consciously guilty before God! This, surely, is the worm that
   dies not and the fire that is not quenched!

   I do not speak, now, what I have merely heard of, though, if you will
   read Mr. Bunyan's, "Grace Abounding," you will find a striking account
   of it there. I speak of what I have felt in my own soul. No pains of
   body can rival, for a moment, the agonized feeling of the heart when
   the hot irons of conviction burn their way through the soul. When God
   sets up the conscience and makes it a target for His arrows, they drink
   up the life blood of our spirit till we cry out and wonder how such
   anguish can come to a creature so insignificant. Our soul seems too
   small a cup to contain such an ocean of misery--too narrow a field for
   so cruel a battle. It is not the Lord that is the author of the misery,
   but He is giving us up, for a while, that we may be filled with our own
   ways and learn the bitterness of our own sin. When the Lord comes to us
   with a forgiving word, these sorrows are gone like the mists of the
   morning when the sun arises. We still grieve to think that we have
   sinned, but that gnawing remorse, that vulture eating up the liver, is
   smitten with death and the man breathes hopefully again. Though the
   penitence remains, the torment is removed from me, when God has
   forgiven me.

   Let me say, here, that full forgiveness of sin, consciously enjoyed,
   will not only lift an enormous weight from off the soul, but it will
   breathe into the heart a great joy. When you know that sin is forgiven,
   you cannot be sad as before. The thought of perfect pardon, if it does
   but fill the spirit, will thrust out gloom and remove apathy. It will
   make the lame man leap as a hart--he may still be lame, but he will
   leap as if he were not! And the tongue of the dumb, even though
   untrained to speech, shall be made to sing concerning Free Grace and
   dying love. When the thoughts are concentrated upon the enjoyment of
   complete forgiveness, full reception into the Divine favor and the
   blotting out of sin, then is the heart lifted into the suburbs of
   Heaven! My dear Hearers, do you know what I am talking about? Some of
   you do, blessed be the name of the Lord, but I am afraid that some of
   you do not--and you never will know the sweetness of mercy until you
   have first tasted the bitterness of sin! You will never know how Divine
   Grace can heal until you have felt how sin can wound. There is no
   clothing you till you are stripped. There is no making you alive till
   you are killed. There is no filling you till you are empty.

   The Lord fills the hungry with good things, but the rich He sends away
   empty. God Himself will never comfort you till you are driven to
   self-despair--and if you have already come to that, it is a great
   privilege to me to be allowed to tell you that the fact of forgiveness
   of sin is not only a doctrine of the creed, but it is a promise of
   God's Word! "I believe in the forgiveness of sins"--this is no mere
   formula, but a realized fact with me. Removal of the penalty, removal
   of God's offense against us, the clearing away of all the turbid waters
   within the heart and the creation of joy and peace through perfect
   reconciliation to God--this is a summary account of the forgiveness of
   sin. It is a vast and rich blessing!

   II. And now, secondly, THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS IS BOUND UP WITH
   REDEMPTION BY BLOOD. Take the text, "In whom we have redemption through
   His blood, the forgiveness of sins." Redemption and forgiveness are so
   put together as to look as if they were the same thing. Assuredly they
   are so interlaced and intertwisted that there is no having the one
   without the other.

   Do you ask--"How is it that there should always need to be redemption
   by blood in order to the forgiveness of sin?" I call your attention to
   the expression, "Redemption through His blood." Observe, it is not
   redemption through His power, it is through His blood. It is not
   redemption through His love, it is through His blood. This is insisted
   upon emphatically, since, in order to the forgiveness of sins, it is
   redemption through His blood, as you have it over and over again in
   Scripture. "Without shedding of blood is no remission." But they
   say--they say--that Substitution is not just! One said, the other day,
   that to lay sin upon Christ and to treat Him as guilty--and let Him die
   for the unjust--was not just! Yet the objector went on to say that God
   forgave men freely without any atonement at all! Of this wise critic I
   would ask--Is that just? Is it just to pass by breaches of the law
   without a penalty? Why any law at all? And why should men care whether
   they keep it or break it? It was stated by this critic that God, out of
   His boundless love, treated the guilty man as if he were innocent. I
   would ask--if that is right, where is the wrong of God's treating us as
   innocent because of the righteousness of Christ?

   I venture to affirm that pardon is needless, if not impossible, upon
   the theory that the man, though guilty, is treated as if he were not
   guilty. If all are treated alike, whether guilty or not guilty, why
   should anyone desire pardon? It were easy to answer quibblers, but they
   really are not worth the answering! It is to me always sufficient if I
   find a Truth of God taught in Scripture--I ask no more. If I do not
   understand it, I am not particularly anxious to understand it! If it is
   in the Scriptures, I believe it. I like those grand, rocky Truths of
   the Bible which I cannot break with the hammer of my understanding, for
   on these I lay the foundations of my soul's confidence! Redemption by
   blood is here linked with forgiveness of sins and, in many other
   Scriptures we find it plainly stated. It is so. Let that stand for a
   sufficient answer to all objectors.

   And it is so, if we come to think of it, because this reflects great
   honor upon God. They say, "Let God simply forgive the sin and have done
   with it." But where, then, is His justice? "Shall not the Judge of the
   earth do right?" He threatened sin with punishment. If He does not
   execute His threats, what then? Can we be sure that He will fulfill His
   promises? If He breaks His Word one way, might He not break it another?
   If the Lord should not execute the penalty which He has threatened for
   sin, would it not look as if He made a mistake in threatening a penalty
   at all? Would it not seem as if He had been too severe, at first, and
   then had to catch Himself up and revise His own judgment afterwards?
   And shall that be? Might it not be supposed that, after all, God made
   much ado about nothing and that He was really jesting with men

   when He threatened them with fearful punishment on account of sin?
   Shall God say, "Yes," and, "No"? Shall He speak and not speak?

   This is according to the folly of man! Sometimes it may even be wisdom
   in a fallible man to reverse his word and retract his declaration, but
   with God this cannot be! It is necessary for the vindication of His own
   justice, His wisdom and His holiness, that He shall not forego one of
   His threats any more than one of His promises! And, since it is just
   that sin should be punished and that, though the sinner should, in
   wondrous mercy be permitted to go free, it is wise and just that
   Another should step in--God Himself should step in--and bear for the
   sinner what is due to the justice of the Most High. The Substitution of
   our Lord in our place is the central Doctrine of the Gospel and it
   greatly glorifies the name of

   God.

   Besides that, Beloved, that sin should not be pardoned without an
   Atonement is for the welfare of the universe. This world is but a speck
   compared with the universe of God. We cannot even imaging the
   multitudes of beings over which the great Lawgiver has rule. And if it
   could be whispered anywhere in that universe that, on this planet, God
   tampered with law, set aside justice, or did anything, in fact, to save
   His own chosen, so that He threw His own threats behind His back and
   disregarded His own solemn ordinance--why, this report would strike at
   the foundations of the Eternal Throne! Is God unjust in any case? Then
   how can He judge the universe? What creatures, then, would fear God,
   when they knew that He could play fast and loose with justice? It were
   a calamity even greater than Hell, itself, that sin should go
   unpunished! The very reins of moral order would be snatched from the
   hand of the great Charioteer--and I know not what of mischief would
   happen! Evil would then have mounted to the high Throne of God and
   would have become supreme throughout His domains. It is for the welfare
   of the universe, throughout the ages, that in the forgiveness of sins
   there should be redemption by blood. Let lovers of anarchy cavil at it,
   but let good men accept the Sacrifice of the Son of God with joy as the
   great establishment of law and justice.

   Moreover, this also is arranged for our comfort and as assurance of
   heart. I declare before you all that if I had been anywhere assured,
   when I was under conviction of sin, that God could forgive me outright
   without any atonement, it would have yielded no sort of satisfaction to
   me, for my conscience was sitting in judgment upon myself and I felt
   that if I were on the Throne of God, I must condemn myself to Hell.
   Even if I could have derived a temporary comfort from the notion of
   forgiveness apart from atonement, the question would afterwards have
   come up--how is this just? If God does not punish me, He ought to do
   so--how can He do otherwise? He must be just, or He is not God! It must
   be that such sin as mine should bring punishment upon itself. Never,
   until I understood the great Truth of God of the substitutionary death
   of Christ, could my conscience get a moment's peace! If an atonement
   was not necessary for God, it certainly was necessary for me--and it
   seems to me necessary to every conscience that is fairly instructed as
   to the absolute certainty that sin involves deserved sorrow--and that
   every transgression and every iniquity must have its just recompense of
   reward. It was necessary for the perpetual peace of every enlightened
   conscience that the glorious Atonement should have been provided.

   Besides that, the Lord meant to save us in a safe way for the promotion
   of our future reverence for the Law. Now, if sin had been blotted out
   so readily and nothing more said of it, what effect would that have had
   on us in the future? I think that everyone who has felt the burden of
   sin, has stood at the foot of the Cross, heard the cries of the great
   Sacrifice and read God's wrath against sin written in crimson lines
   upon the blessed and perfect Person of the innocent Savior--every such
   person feels that sin is an awful thing! You cannot trifle with
   transgression after a vision of Gethsemane. You cannot laugh at it and
   talk about the littleness of its demerit, if you have once stood on
   Golgotha and heard the cry, "Eli, Eli, lame Sabachthani?" The death of
   the Son of God upon the Cross is the grandest of all moral lessons
   because it is a lesson that affects the very soul of the man and
   changes his whole idea of sin. The Cross straightens him from the
   desperate twist which sin gave him at the first. The cure of the first
   Adam's fall is the second Adam's death--the second Adam's Grace, which
   comes to us through His great Sacrifice! We love sin till we see that
   it killed our best Friend--and then we loathe it forevermore.

   I say, again, that if the great Father forgave you and said, "There is
   nothing in it. Go your way, it is all over," you would have lacked that
   grand source of sanctified life which now you find in the wounds of Him
   who has made sin detestable to you--and has made perfect obedience,
   even unto death--the subject of your soul's admiration. Now you long to

   be unto the great Father, in your measure, what your great Redeemer was
   to Him when He magnified the Law and made it honorable. This is no mean
   benefit.

   O Beloved Friends, I do bless the Lord, at this time, for the
   forgiveness of sins through redemption by blood! There is something
   worth preaching in this Truth of God. You can live on it--you can die
   on it. I am constantly--almost every week--at the deathbeds of our
   members here--we are so large a Church that one or two, every week, are
   going Home. When we begin to talk about the precious blood of
   Jesus--the blood of the Everlasting Covenant, you should see the
   brightness of dying eyes! I mark the quiet of the departing spirit and,
   as my dear Friends grip my hand, their testimony is unvaryingly, "Jesus
   is the Rock of our confidence and all is well."

   Lord Jesus, hold Your Cross before my closing eyes! O blessed Redeemer,
   what will a man do in death who has not Your death to be the death of
   his sin? How can a man live who has never seen You lay down Your life
   in His place, "the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God"? Whatever
   others may say, let us repeat our text with solemn assurance, "In whom
   we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins."

   III. But now, thirdly--and the text is very clear upon this, as upon
   the other two points--THE FORGIVENESS

   OF SIN IS STILL A MATTER OF GRACE--AND OF RICH GRACE. "We have
   redemption through His blood, the

   forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His Grace."

   1 admit that the forgiveness of sins, on God's part, is a matter
   ofjustice, now that the redemption by blood has been completed. The man
   believes. The man confesses his sin. And it is written, "If we confess
   our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins." The
   Sacrifice is so great that it justly puts away the sin and it is
   righteously forgiven. But observe this--the act of God in forgiving is
   not one atom the less gracious, because, in His infinite wisdom, He has
   so contrived that it is unquestionably just. If any make this
   assertion, they will be called upon to prove it--and they can prove it.

   Pardon is the more gracious to us that it does not come to us in an
   unrighteous way. We see God's great prudence and wisdom in planning the
   method by which He may "be just, and the Justifier of him that
   believes." Those thoughts and plans on God's part are all tokens of
   great love to us. Beloved, it is only by Divine Grace that we are
   justified, yet that this Grace is exercised in a way of justice causes
   the Grace to be not less, but even manifestly more gracious!

   The death of Christ, the redemption by blood, instead of veiling the
   Grace of God, only manifests it. Put the thing before your own minds.
   Suppose that somebody has offended you and you say, "Think no more of
   it. It is all forgiven"? Very well. That is kind of you and
   commendable. It shows the graciousness of your character. But suppose,
   on the other hand, you were in office as a judge and felt compelled to
   say, "I am willing to forgive you, but your offense has resulted in
   such great mischiefs and all these things have to be cleared away. I
   will tell you what I will do. I will clear them away myself. I will
   bear the result of your sin in order that my pardon may be seen to be
   most sure and full. I will pay the debt in which you have involved
   yourself. I will go to the prison to which you ought to go as the
   consequence of what you have done. I will suffer the effect of your
   wrongdoing instead of condemning you to suffer it"?

   Well, now, the forgiveness that costs you so much would manifest your
   graciousness much more than that which costs you nothing beyond a kind
   will and a tender heart! Oh, if it is so, that God, the Divine Ruler,
   the Judge of all the earth, says to guilty man, "I will pardon you, but
   it is imperative that My Law be carried out. And this cannot be done
   except by the death of My dear Son, who is One with Me, who is very God
   of very God, who Himself wills to stand in your place and vindicate My
   justice by suffering the penalty due to you"--then I say that the Grace
   of God is a thousandfold more clearly shown than by the free
   forgiveness which "modern thought" pleads for! Pardon which has cost
   God more than it cost Him to make all worlds--which has cost Him more
   than to manage all the empires of His Provi-dence--which has cost Him
   His Only-Begotten Son and has cost that Only-Begotten Son a life of
   sorrow and a death of unutterable and immeasurable anguish--I say that
   this pardon is pre-eminently gracious! Love is more displayed in this,
   infinitely more, than by a mere word and a wave of the hand which would
   dismiss the sinner without any attempt at an atoning sacrifice.

   Besides, Beloved, let this always be remembered, that it is in the
   application of redemption and the personal pardon of any sinner,
   through the blood of Jesus, that the Grace of God is best seen by that
   sinner. To each one, that pardon through the Lord Jesus comes, not only
   according to Grace, but "according to the riches of His Grace." I can
   understand that God should forgive you, all of you. I could hear it
   with full belief and it would not astonish me. But that He should
   pardon me--that I should have the forgiveness of sins and redemption by
   blood--that truly astonishes me! And I believe

   that any person, under a sense of sin, sees more of the Grace of God in
   His own salvation than in the salvation of anybody else. He may be
   quite conscious that he has never been a thief, or a drunk, or a
   murderer and yet, when he comes to look at it, he may see reasons why
   the pardon of sin in his case should be more remarkable than even in
   the case of a drunk, or a thief, or a murderer! There may be elements
   in his own case which may make him seem to have sinned even more
   grievously than open transgressors because he transgressed against
   greater light, with less temptation and with a direr presumption of
   rebellion against the Most High. That Jesus died is unutterable
   Grace--but that He loved me and gave Himself for me--this is
   overwhelming Grace and makes the heir of Heaven say with emphasis,
   "Blessed be God that, in Jesus, I have redemption through His blood,
   the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His Grace!"

   Do you not feel at this time, you that have been pardoned, that nothing
   but the riches of God's Grace could ever have pardoned you? No scanty
   Grace could have provided an atonement equal to your iniquities!
   Poverty of Grace would have left you ruined by your debt of sin! Riches
   of Grace were needed and riches of Grace were forthcoming in redemption
   by blood and in the full, perfect, irreversible forgiveness which God
   gave you in the day when you believed on Jesus Christ your Savior! Oh,
   that the Holy Spirit would help you to sing of the Grace of God today
   and every day!

   IV. Thus far have I brought you, then, in three remarks. Kindly follow
   me in the fourth one, upon which I will not be long.

   Fourthly, THIS FORGIVENESS OF SINS IS ENJOYED BY US NOW. "In whom we
   have"--we have--

   "redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to
   the riches of His Grace." I remember the astonishment with which I felt
   as I sat in a ministers' meeting and heard one who professed to be a
   preacher of the Gospel, assert that he did not think that any of us
   could be sure that he was forgiven. I ventured at once to say that I
   was sure--and I was pleased, but by no means surprised, to find that
   others dared to say the same. I hope I have hundreds before me who
   enjoy the same assurance!

   Brothers and Sisters, if there is no consciousness of the forgiveness
   of sins possible, how can there be any rest for the conscience? Yet
   Jesus says, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and
   I will give you rest." What rest is possible to the condemned? Can you
   go to bed tonight with your sins unforgiven? Some of you may have the
   foolhardi-ness to do that, but I would not dare to do it! Look where
   you are. Within a moment you may be dead. Within that moment you will
   be in Hell, past all hope. In a single instant you may be eternally
   lost--can you endure the thought? Our breath has but to stop, or the
   heart to cease beating and instantly life is over! How can you be at
   peace while sin is unfor-given? Unless sin had made men mad, they would
   never rest till they were cleared from their sins. There cannot be any
   true rest without a consciousness of forgiveness. Yet that rest is
   promised--therefore the present enjoyment of an assurance of
   forgiveness must be possible!

   And, next, where could there ever be that great love in the hearts of
   men and women which we read of in Scripture? She that washed the
   Savior's feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her
   head--would she have done so if she had not known that she was
   forgiven? She loved much because she had had much forgiven her! And the
   stimulus, the zeal, the fervor that spurs on a man in his service and
   suffering for the Lord Jesus must arise out of the consciousness that
   the Lord has done great things for him--and the conclusion that,
   therefore, he must do great things for his Lord. Surely, you have
   robbed Christianity of its highest moral force if you have denied the
   possibility of knowing that you are pardoned!

   Moreover, where is there any testimony of the power of Grace? We that
   come and preach to you would be liars if we, ourselves, have never
   tasted and handled pardoning Grace. We do, at any rate, but preach to
   you a second-hand Gospel, which we have never tested and proved for
   ourselves. If I did not know, in my very soul, that the blood of Jesus
   Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin, how could I dare to face you
   with the Gospel message? I have not impudence enough to tell you of
   what is, or is not the Truth of God, about which I am uncertain myself!
   God grant me Grace to break stones, or sweep chimneys sooner than come
   and tell you a cunningly-devised fable, or a tale about which I have no
   assured certainty, derived from personal knowledge! Could I say to you,
   "I dare say there is bread, but I myself am hungry and I have never
   eaten a mouthful of the provision which I offer you"? Think of my
   saying to one perishing of thirst, "There is Living Water flowing from
   the Rock, but personally I am thirsty." You might say to me at once,
   "Then go home to your house and next time you appear, be sure of the
   truth of what you tell us. If you do not believe it, how should we
   believe it?" Beloved, there are thousands, there are still tens of
   thousands on earth who know that the Son of God has power on

   earth to forgive sins! And there are myriads in Heaven who passed to
   their happiness confident that they had been forgiven--and they sang on
   earth the same song that they sing in Heaven, "Worthy is the Lamb that
   was slain." They have washed their robes and made them white in the
   blood of the Lamb! They know it, they have no doubt about it! Many of
   us know it here and rejoice therein at this moment.

   Dear Friend, what would you give to have this assurance? You may have
   it--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." "He
   that believes and is baptized shall be saved." "Whoever believes in Him
   is justified from all sin." "He that believes in Him has everlasting
   life." Oh, that God's Grace may lead you to cast away all other
   confidences and to lay your guilty spirit down at Jesus' feet! Then
   shall you go your way rejoicing that you, also, with us, can say, "In
   whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins."

   V. Fifthly--and this is only a brief head, but it is a point that must
   not be left out--THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS

   BINDS US TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. Let us read the text again. "In whom
   we have redemption through His

   blood." We have nothing apart from Jesus! Every blessing of the
   Covenant binds us to Christ. Covenant gifts are so many golden chains
   to fasten the soul of the Believer to his Lord. Our wealth of mercy is
   all in Christ. There is nothing good outside of Christ. When are we
   pardoned, Brothers and Sisters? When have we forgiveness? Why, when we
   are in Him, "in whom we have redemption through His blood, the
   forgiveness of sins." O son of Adam, living without Jesus, hear and
   take warning! So long as you are out of Christ, you must bear your own
   burden till it crushes you to the dust! But as soon as you have touched
   the hem of His garment there is a link of connection--and if you can
   rise from that to holding Him by the feet--the union is closer! And if
   you can, from that, become like Simeon, who took Him up in his arms,
   then may you cry, "My eyes have seen Your salvation!" When you have
   Christ to the fullest, you have Grace to the fullest! It is as you are
   in Christ--in connection and communion with Christ--that you receive
   the pardon of sin, for all the pardon is in Him. Do you see that?

   "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
   sins." The forgiveness is not so much in His office and in His work, as
   in Himself. When you get Christ, you have redemption, for He is
   Redemption. When you get Christ, you have forgiveness of sins, for He
   is the Propitiation for our sins. He has put the sin away by the
   Sacrifice of Himself. Get Christ and you have the proof, the evidence,
   the sum, the substance of perfect pardon. If you accept the Beloved,
   you are "accepted in the Beloved." When you are in Him, then you are
   forgiven, but your forgiveness is only in Him. In Him you have
   redemption--out of Him you are in bondage.

   Beloved, every day, as we go afresh to God for a sense of pardon, let
   us know that we can never get it unless we come viewing Jesus. I notice
   that some Believers, when they get rather dull and cold, begin the work
   of self-examination. This may appear very proper, but it is dreary
   work. I do not believe, dear Friends, if you are very poor, that you
   will ever get rich by looking through all your empty cupboards. If it
   is very cold and you have no coals in the cellar, you will not become
   warm by going into the cellar and seeing that there is nothing below
   but an empty coal hole. No, no--if our Graces are to be revived we must
   begin with a renewed consciousness of pardon through the precious
   blood--and the only way to get that sense of pardon is to go to the
   Cross, again, even as we went at first! I sometimes wonder that you do
   not get tired of my preaching because I do nothing but hammer away on
   this one nail. I have driven it in up to the head and I have gone round
   to the other side to clinch it--but I still keep at it. With me it is,
   year after year, "None but Jesus! None but Jesus!" Oh, you great
   saints, if you have outgrown the need of a sinner's trust in the Lord
   Jesus, you have outgrown your sins! But you have also outgrown your
   Grace and your saintship has ruined you! He that has the mind of Christ
   within him must still come to his Lord, just as he came at the first.

   I frankly confess that still I cry to my Lord Jesus--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling."

   Still, to this day, I have no redemption in myself, but only in Jesus!
   I am not an inch forwarder as to the ground of my trust. Is it not so
   with you? Do we not still say of Jesus--"In whom we have redemption
   through His blood"? To this day we find no reason for forgiveness in
   ourselves. The precious blood is still our one plea! Lost and condemned
   are we apart from the one offering of our Great High Priest. But
   cleansed and justified are we in Him--

   "Oh, how sweet to view the flowing

   Of His sin-atoning blood!

   With Divine assurance knowing,

   He has made my peace with God." You know the story of the poor
   bricklayer who fell from a scaffold, and when they took him up, he was
   so much injured that they fetched a minister to him, who, stooping over
   him, said, "My dear Man, you have a very short time to live. I entreat
   you to make your peace with God." To the surprise of the minister, the
   man opened his eyes and said, "Make my peace with God, Sir? It was made
   for me nearly 1,900 years ago, upon the Cross of Calvary, by Him that
   loved me and gave Himself for me." Oh, the joy which this creates in
   the heart! Yes, it is in Jesus that the peace is made-- effectually
   made, made for me, made for you, made for all Believers! In Jesus is
   perfect redemption! In Jesus pardon is provided, proclaimed, presented
   and sealed upon the conscience! Go and live on Jesus; live with Jesus;
   live in Jesus; never go away from Jesus and may He be dearer to you
   every day of your lives! Blessed be His adorable name! Amen, and Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Ephesians 1.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Statute of David for the Sharing of the Spoil

   (No. 2208)

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 7, 1891,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they
   could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook
   Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that
   were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
   Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went
   with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give
   them any of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his
   wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart. Then
   said David, You shall not do so, my Brethren, with that which the Lord
   has given us, who has preserved us, and delivered the company that came
   against us into our hands. For who will hearken unto you in this
   matter? But as his part is that goes down to the battle so shall his
   part be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike. And it was so
   from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for
   Israel unto this day." 1 Samuel 30:21-26.

   THOSE who associate themselves with a leader must share his fortunes.
   Six hundred men had left their abodes in Judea. Unable to endure the
   tyranny of Saul, they had linked themselves with David and made him to
   be a captain over them. They were, some of them, the best of men, and
   some of them were the worst--in this, resembling our congregations.
   Some of them were choice spirits whom David would have sought, but
   others were undesirable persons from whom he might gladly have been
   free. However, be they who they may, they must rise or fall with their
   leader and commander. If he had the city Ziklag given to him, they had
   a house and a home in it. And if Ziklag was burned with fire, their
   houses did not escape. When David stood amid the smoking ruins, a
   penniless and a wifeless man, they stood in the same condition. This
   rule holds good with all of us who have joined ourselves to Christ and
   His cause--we must be partakers with Him. I hope we are prepared to
   stand to this rule today. If there is ridicule and reproach for the
   Gospel of Christ, let us be willing to be ridiculed and reproached for
   His sake. Let us gladly share with Him in His humiliation and never
   dream of shrinking. This involves a great privilege, since they that
   are with Him in His humiliation shall be with Him in His Glory. If we
   share His rebuke in the midst of an evil generation, we shall also sit
   upon His Throne and share His Glory in the day of His appearing.
   Brothers and Sisters, I hope the most of us can say we are in for
   it--to sink or swim with Jesus. In life or death, where He is, there
   will we, His servants, be. We joyfully accept both the Cross and the
   Crown which go with our Lord Jesus Christ--we are eager to bear our
   full share of the blame, that we may partake in His joy.

   It frequently happens that when a great disaster occurs to a band of
   men, a mutiny follows. However little it may be the leader's fault, the
   defeated cast the blame of the defeat upon him. If the fight is won,
   "it was a soldiers' battle"-- every man at arms claims his share of
   praise. But if the battle is lost, blame the commander! It was entirely
   his fault--if he had been a better general, he might have won the day.
   This is how people talk--fairness is out of the question. So in the
   great disaster at Ziklag, when the town was burned with fire, and wives
   and children were carried away captive-- then we read that they spoke
   of stoning David. Why David? Why David more than anybody else, it is
   hard to see, for he was not there, nor any one of them. They felt so
   vexed, that it would be a relief to stone somebody--and why not David?
   Brethren, it sometimes happens, even to the servants of Christ, that
   when they fall into persecution and loss for Christ's sake, the tempter
   whispers to them to throw up their profession. "Since you have been a
   Christian, you have had nothing but trouble. It seems as if the dogs of
   Hell were snapping at your heels more than ever since you took upon you
   the name of Christ. Therefore, throw it up and leave the ways of
   godliness." Vile suggestion! Mutiny against the Lord Jesus? Dare you do
   so? Some of us cannot do so, for when He asks us, "Will you, also, go
   away?" we can only answer, "Lord, to whom should we go? You have the
   Words of eternal life." No other leader is worth following! We must
   follow the Son of David. Mutiny against Him is out of the question--

   "Through floods or flames, if Jesus leads, We'll follow where He goes."

   When a dog follows a man, we may discover whether the man is his master
   by seeing what happens when they come to a turn in the road. If the
   creature keeps close to its master at all turnings, it belongs to him.
   Every now and then you and I come to turns in the road and many of us
   are ready, through Divine Grace, to prove our loyalty by following
   Jesus even when the way is hardest. Though the tears stand in His eyes
   and in ours. Though we weep together till we have no more power to
   weep, we will cling to Him, when the many turn aside, and witness that
   He has the Living Word and none upon earth beside. God grant us Grace
   to be faithful unto death!

   If we thus follow our Leader and bear His reproach, the end and issue
   will be glorious victory. It was a piteous sight to see David leaving
   200 men behind him and marching with his much diminished forces after
   an enemy who had gone, he scarcely knew where, who might be 10 times
   stronger than his little band, and might slay those who pursued them.
   It was a melancholy spectacle for those left behind to see their leader
   a broken man, worn and weary like themselves, hastening after the cruel
   Amalekite. How very different was the scene when he came back to the
   brook Besor more than a conqueror! Do you not hear the song of them
   that make merry? A host of men in the front are driving vast herds of
   cattle and flocks of sheep--and singing as they march, "This is David's
   spoil!" Then you see armed men with David in the midst of them, all
   laden with spoil, and you hear them singing yet another song! Those
   that bring up the rear are shouting exultingly, "David recovered all!
   David recovered all!" They, the worn-out ones that stayed at the brook
   Besor, hear the mingled song and join first in the one shout, and then
   in the other, singing, "This is David's spoil! David recovered

   all!"

   Yes, we have no doubt about the result of our warfare. He that is
   faithful to Christ shall be glorified with Him. That He will divide the
   spoil with the strong is never a matter of question. "The pleasure of
   the Lord shall prosper in His hands." The old Truth of God by which we
   stand shall never be blotted out--

   "Engraved as in eternal brass

   The mighty promise shines!

   Nor shall the powers of darkness erase

   Those everlasting lines."

   We are certain as we live that the exiled Truth shall celebrate its
   joyful return. The faith once for all delivered to the saints may be
   downtrodden for a season--but rejoice not over us, O our
   adversaries--though we fall, we shall rise again! Therefore we
   patiently hope, quietly wait and calmly believe. We drink of the brook
   Besor by the way and lift up our heads.

   This morning I want to utter God-given words of comfort to those who
   are faint and weary in the Lord's army. May the Divine Comforter make
   them so!

   I. I shall begin by saying, first, that FAINT ONES OCCUR EVEN IN THE
   ARMY OF OUR KING. Among the very elect of David's army--heroes who were
   men of war from their youth up--there were hands that hung down and
   feeble knees that needed to be confirmed. There are such in Christ's
   army at most seasons. We have among us soldiers whose faith is real and
   whose love is burning and yet, for all that, just now their strength is
   weakened in the way and they are so depressed in spirit, that they are
   obliged to stay behind with the baggage.

   Possibly some of these weary ones had grown faint because they had been
   a good deal perplexed. David had so wrongfully entangled himself with
   the Philistine king, that he felt bound to go with Achish to fight
   against Israel. I dare say these men said to themselves, "How will this
   end? Will David really lead us to battle against Saul? When he could
   have killed him in the cave, he would not, but declared that he would
   not lift up his hand against the Lord's anointed! Will he now take us
   to fight against the anointed of God? This David, who was so great an
   enemy of Philistia and slew their champion, will he war on their
   behalf?"

   They were perplexed with their leader's movements. I do not know
   whether you agree with me, but I find that half-an-hour's perplexity
   takes more out of a man than a month's labor. When you cannot see your
   bearings and know not what to do, it is most trying. When, to be true
   to God, it seems that you must break faith with man--and when, to
   fulfill

   your unhappy covenant with evil would make you false to your Christian
   profession, things are perplexing! If you do not walk carefully, you
   can easily get into a snarl. If Christians walk in a straight line, it
   is comparatively easy going, for it is easy to find your way along a
   straight road. But when good men take to the new cut, that by-path
   across the meadow, then they often get into ditches that are not on the
   map and fall into thickets and sloughs that they never reckoned upon.
   Then is the time for heart-sickness to come on. These warriors may very
   well have been perplexed and, perhaps, they feared that God was against
   them--and that now their cause would be put to shame. And when they
   came to Ziklag and found it burned with fire, the perplexity of their
   minds added intense bitterness to their sorrow and they felt bowed into
   the dust. They did not pretend to be faint, but they were really so,
   for the mind can soon act upon the body and the body fails sadly when
   the spirits are worried with questions and fears. This is one reason
   why certain of our Lord's loyal-hearted ones are on the sick list and
   must stay in the barracks for a while.

   Perhaps, also, the pace was killing to these men. They made forced
   marches for three days from the city of Achish to Ziklag. These men
   could do a good day's march with anybody, but they could not foot it at
   the double quick march all day long. There are a great many Christians
   of that sort--good, staying men who can keep on under ordinary
   pressure, doing daily duty well and resisting ordinary temptations
   bravely. But at a push they fare badly--who among us does not? To us
   there may come multiplied labors and we faint because our strength is
   small.

   Worst of all, their grief came in just then. Their wives were gone.
   Although, as it turned out, they were neither killed nor otherwise
   harmed, yet they could not know this--and they feared the worse. For a
   man to know that his wife is in the hands of robbers and that he may
   never see her again is no small trouble. Their sons and daughters were
   also gone-- no prattlers climbed their father's knee, no gentle
   daughters came forth to bid them, "Welcome home." Their homes were
   still burning, their goods were consumed and they lifted up their
   voices and wept--is it at all amazing that some of them were faint
   after performing that doleful miserere? Where would you be if you went
   home this morning and found your home burned and your family gone, you
   knew not where?

   I know many Christians who get very faint under extraordinary troubles.
   They should not, but they do. We have reason to thank God that no
   temptation has happened to us but such as is common to men and yet, it
   may not seem so. But we may feel as if we were especially tried, like
   Job. Messenger after messenger has brought us evil tidings and our
   hearts are not fixed on the Lord as they ought to be. To those who are
   faint through grief I speak just now. You may be this and yet you may
   be a true follower of the Lamb--and as God has promised to bring you
   out of your troubles, He will surely keep His word. Remember, He has
   never promised that you shall have no sorrows, but that He will deliver
   you out of them all. Ask yon saints in Heaven! Ask those to step out of
   the shining ranks who came there without trial. Will one of the leaders
   of the shining host give the word of command that he shall step forward
   who has washed his robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,
   but who never knew what affliction meant while here below? No one stirs
   in all that white-robed host! Not one comes forward? Must we wait here
   forever without response? Look! Instead of anyone stirring from their
   ranks, I hear a voice that says, "These are they which came out of
   great tribulation." All of them have known not only tribulation, but
   great tribulation! One promise of the New Testament is surely fulfilled
   before our eyes-- "In the world you shall have tribulation." When
   trouble came so pressingly on David's men, they felt their weakness and
   needed to stop at the bank of the brook.

   Perhaps, also, the force of the torrent was too much for them. As I
   have told you, in all probability the brook Besor was only a hollow
   place which, in ordinary times, was almost dry. But in a season of
   great rain it filled suddenly with a rushing muddy stream, against
   which only strong men could stand. These men might have kept on upon
   dry land, but the current was too fierce for them and they feared that
   it would carry them off their feet and drown them. Therefore, David
   gave them leave to stay there and guard the stuff. Many there are of
   our Lord's servants who stop short of certain onerous service--they are
   not called to do what their stronger comrades undertake with joy. They
   can do something, but they fail to do more--they can also bear certain
   trials, but they are unable to bear more--they faint because they have
   not yet come to fullness of growth in Divine Grace. Their hearts are
   right in the sight of God, but they are not in condition to surmount
   some peculiar difficulty.

   You must not overdrive them, for they are the feeble of the flock. Many
   are too faint for necessary controversy. I have found a great many of
   that sort about lately--the Truth of God is very important, but they
   love peace. It is quite necessary that certain of us should stand up
   for the faith once delivered to the saints, but they are not up to the
   mark for it.

   They cannot bear to differ from their fellows and they hold their
   tongues rather than contend for the Truth of God. There are true hearts
   that, nevertheless, cannot defend the Gospel! They wish well to the
   champions, but they seek the rear rank for themselves. And some cannot
   advance any further with regard to knowledge--they know the
   fundamentals and feel as if they could master nothing more. It is a
   great blessing that they know the Gospel and feel that it will save
   them, but the glorious mysteries of the Everlasting Covenant, of the
   Sovereignty of God, of His eternal love and distinguishing Grace, they
   cannot compass--these are a brook Besor which, as yet, they cannot
   swim. It would do them a world of good if they could venture in but,
   still, they are not to be tempted into these blessed deeps. To hear of
   these things rather wearies them than instructs them. They have not
   strength enough of mind for the deep things of God. I would have every
   Christian wish to know all that he can know of the revealed Truths of
   God. Somebody whispers that the secret things belong not to us. You may
   be sure you will never know them if they are secret, but all that is
   revealed you ought to know, for these things belong to you and to your
   children! Take care you know what the Holy Spirit teaches. Do not give
   way to a fainthearted ignorance, lest you be great losers thereby. That
   which is fit food for babes should not be enough for young men and
   fathers--we should eat strong meat--and leave milk to the little ones.

   Yet these fainting ones were, after all, in David's army. Their names
   were in their Captain's Register as much as the names of the strong.
   And they did not desert the colors. They had the same captain as the
   stoutest-hearted men in the whole regiment. They could call David,
   "Master," and, "Lord," as truly as the most lion-like man among them!
   They were in for the same dangers, for if the men in front had been
   beaten and had retreated, the enemy would have fallen on those who
   guarded the stuff. If the Amalekites had slain the 400, they would have
   made short work of the two hundred. They had work to do as necessary as
   that of the others. Though they had not to fight, they had to take care
   of the stuff-- and this eased the minds of the fighting men. I will be
   bound to say it was a great trial to them not to be allowed to march
   into the fight. For a brave man to see the troops go past him and hear
   the last footfall of his comrades, must have been sickening. Who could
   pleasantly say, "I am left out of it. There is a glorious day coming
   and I shall be away. I shall, until I die, think myself accursed I was
   not there, and hold my manhood cheap that I fought not with them on
   that glorious day." It is hard for brave men to be confined to a
   hospital and have no drive at the foe. The weary one wishes he could be
   in the front where his Captain's eyes would be upon him. He pants to
   smite down the enemies and win back the spoil for his comrades.

   Enough of this. I will only repeat my first point--fainting ones do
   occur, even in the army of our King.

   II. Secondly, THESE FAINTING ONES REJOICE TO SEE THEIR LEADER RETURN.
   Do you see, that when David came back, they went to meet him and the
   people who were with him. I feel very much like this myself. That was
   one reason why I took this text. I felt, after my illness, most happy
   to come forth and meet my Lord in public. I hoped He would be here and
   so He is! I am also glad to meet with you, my Friends. We are still
   spared for the war. Though laid aside a while, we are again among our
   Brothers and Sisters. Thank God! It is a great joy to meet you. I am
   sorry to miss so many of our Church members who are laid aside by this
   sickness, [influenza--see postscript of Sermon #2207] but it is a
   choice blessing to meet so many of our kindred in Christ. We are never
   happier than when we are in fellowship with one another and with our
   Lord.

   David saluted the stay-at-homes. Oh, that He might salute each one of
   us this morning, especially those who have been laid aside! Our King's
   salutations are wonderful for their heartiness. He uses no empty
   compliments nor vain words. Every syllable from His lips is a
   benediction. Every glance of His eyes is an inspiration. When the King,
   Himself, comes near, it is always a feast day to us! It is a high day
   and a holiday, even with the faintest of us, when we hear His voice! So
   they went to meet David and he came to meet them and there was great
   joy. Yes, I venture to mend that, and say there is great joy among us
   now! Glory be to His holy name, the Lord is here! We see Him and
   rejoice with unspeakable joy!

   David's courtesy was as free as it was true. Possibly those who
   remained behind were half afraid that their leader might say, "See
   here, you idle fellows, what we have been doing for you!" No. He
   saluted them, but did not scold them. Perhaps they thought, "He will
   upbraid us that we did not manage to creep into the fray." But no. "He
   gives liberally, and upbraids not." He speaks not a word of upbraiding,
   for his heart pities them and, therefore, he salutes them--"My
   Brethren, God has been gracious to us. All hail!" David would have them
   rejoice together and give praise unto the Most High. He will not dash
   their cup with a drop of bitter.

   Oh, for a salutation from our Lord at this good hour! When Christ comes
   into a company, His Presence makes a heavenly difference. Have you ever
   seen an assembly listening to an orator, all unmoved and stolid?
   Suddenly the Holy Spirit has fallen on the speaker and the King,
   Himself, has been visibly set forth among them in the midst of the
   assembly! And all have felt as if they could leap to their feet and
   cry, "Hallelujah, hallelujah!" Then hearts beat fast and souls leap
   high, for where Jesus is found, His Presence fills the place with
   delight. Now, then, you weary ones, if you are here, any of you, may
   you rejoice as you now meet your Leader and your Leader reveals Himself
   to you! If no one else has a sonnet, I have mine. He must, He shall be
   praised! "You are the King of Glory, O Christ! All Heaven and earth
   adore You. You shall reign forever and ever."

   III. Thirdly, FAINT ONES HAVE THEIR LEADER FOR THEIR ADVOCATE. Listen
   to those foul-mouthed men

   of Belial, these wicked men, how they rail against those whom God has
   afflicted! They came up to David and began blus-tering--"These
   weaklings who were not in the fight, they shall not share the spoil.
   Let them take their wives and children and be gone." These fellows
   spoke with loud, harsh voices and greatly grieved the feebler ones. Who
   was to speak up for them? Their leader became their advocate!

   First, do you notice, He pleads their unity? The followers of the son
   of Jesse are one and inseparable. David said, "You shall not do so, my
   Brethren, with that which the Lord has given us, who has preserved us."
   "We are all one," says David. "God has given the spoil, not to you,
   alone, but to us all. We are all one company of brothers." The unity of
   saints is the consolation of the feeble. Brothers and Sisters, our Lord
   Jesus Christ would refresh His wearied ones by the reflection that we
   are all one in Him. I may be the foot, all dusty and travel-stained,
   and you may be the hand, holding forth some precious gem, but we are
   still one body. Yonder friend is the brow of holy thought and another
   is the lip of persuasion and a third is the eye of watchfulness, but
   still, we are one body in Christ. We cannot do, any one of us, without
   his fellow--each one ministers to the benefit of all. The eye cannot
   say to the hand, "I have no need of you." We are all one in Christ
   Jesus. Surely this ought to comfort those of you who, by reason of
   feebleness, are made to feel as if you were very inferior members of
   the body--you are still living members of the mystical body of Jesus
   Christ your Lord-- and let this suffice you. One life is ours, one love
   is ours, one Heaven shall be ours in our one Savior!

   David further pleaded Free Grace, for he said to them, "You shall not
   do so, my Brethren, with that which the Lord has given us." He did not
   say, "With that which you have conquered and fairly earned in battle,"
   but, "that which the Lord has given us." Look upon every blessing as a
   gift and you will not think any shut out from it, not even yourself!
   The gift of God is eternal life--why should you not have it? Deny not
   to anyone of your Brothers and Sisters any comfort of the Covenant of
   Grace. Think not of any man, "He ought not to have so much joy." It is
   all of Free Grace and if Free Grace rules the hour, the least may have
   it as well as the greatest! If it is all of Free Grace, then, my poor
   struggling Brother, who can hardly feel assured that you are saved, yet
   if you are a Believer, you may claim every blessing of the Lord's
   gracious Covenant! God freely gives to you as well as to me the
   provisions of His love--therefore let us be glad and not judge
   ourselves after the manner of the law of condemnation!

   Then he pleaded their needfulness. He said, "These men abided by the
   stuff." No army fights well when its camp is unguarded. It is a great
   thing for a Church to know that its stores are well guarded by a
   praying band. While some of us are teaching in the school or preaching
   in the street, we have great comfort in knowing that a certain number
   of our friends are praying for us. To me it is a boundless solace that
   I live in the prayers of thousands! I will not say which does the
   better service--the man that preaches, or the man that prays--but I
   know this, that we can do better without the voice that preaches than
   without the heart that prays. The petitions of our bed-ridden Sisters
   are the wealth of the Church! The kind of service which seems most
   commonplace among men is often the most precious unto God. Therefore,
   as for those who cannot come into the front places of warfare, deny
   them not seats of honor, since, after all, they may be doing the
   greater good. Remember the statute, "They shall part alike."

   Notice that David adds to his pleading a statute. I like to think of
   our great Commander, the Lord Jesus, making statutes. For whom does He
   legislate? For the first three? For the captains of thousands? No. He
   makes a statute for those who are forced to stay at home because they
   are faint. Blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus! He is always looking
   to the interests of those who have nobody else to care for them! If you
   can look after your own cause, you may do so, but if you are so happy
   as to be weak in yourself, you shall be strong in Christ. Those who
   have Christ to care for them are

   better off than if they took care of themselves. He that can leave his
   concerns with Christ has left them in good hands. Vain is the help of
   self, but all-sufficient is the aid of Jesus!

   To sum up what I mean--I believe the Lord will give to the sick and the
   suffering an equal reward with the active and energetic if they are
   equally concerned for His Glory. The Lord will also make a fair
   division to the obscure and unknown as well as to the renowned and
   honored if they are equally earnest. Oh, tell me not that she who rears
   her boy for Christ shall miss her reward from Him by whom an Apostle is
   recompensed! Tell me not that the woman who so conducts her household
   that her servants come to fear God, shall be forgotten in the day when
   the "Well dones" are distributed to the faithful! Homely and unnoticed
   service shall have honor as surely as that with which the world is
   ringing!

   Some of God's people are illiterate and they have but little native
   talent. But if they serve the Lord as best they can, with all their
   heart, they shall take their part with those that are the most learned
   and accomplished! He that is faithful over a little shall have his full
   reward of Divine Grace. It is accepted according to what a man has. We
   may possess no more than two mites, but if we cast them into the
   treasury, our Lord will think much of them.

   Some dear servants of God seem always to be defeated. They seem sent to
   a people whose hearts are made gross and their ears dull of hearing.
   Still, if they have truthfully proclaimed the Word of the Lord, their
   reward will not be according to their apparent success, but according
   to their fidelity.

   Some saints are constitutionally depressed and sad. They are like
   certain lovely ferns which grow best under a constant drip. Well, well,
   the Lord will gather these beautiful ferns of the shade as well as the
   roses of the sun! They shall share His notice as much as the blazing
   sunflowers and the saddest shall rejoice with the gladdest. You
   Little-Faiths, you Despondencies, you Much-Afraids, you Feeble-Minds,
   you that sigh more than you sing, you that would but cannot, you that
   have a great heart for holiness but feel beaten back in your struggles,
   the Lord shall give you His love, His Grace, His favor, as surely as He
   gives it to those who can do great things in His name! Certain of you
   have but a scant experience of the higher joys and deeper insights of
   the Kingdom, and it may be that you are, in part, at fault because you
   are so backward. And yet, if true to your Lord, your infirmities shall
   not be reckoned as iniquities! If lawfully detained from the field of
   active labor, this statute stands fast forever, for you as well as for
   others--"As his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part
   be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike."

   IV. Now, fourthly, FAINT ONES FIND JESUS TO BE THEIR GOOD LORD IN EVERY
   WAY. Was He not a

   good Lord when He first took us into His army of salvation? What a
   curious crew they were that enlisted under David! "Everyone that was in
   debt, and everyone that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him,
   and he became a captain over them." He was a captain of ragamuffins!
   But our Lord had not a better following. I was a poor wretch when I
   came to Christ. And I should not wonder if that word is near enough to
   the truth to describe you. I was a good-for-nothing, over head and ears
   in debt and without a penny to pay. I came to Jesus so utterly down at
   the heel, that no one else would have acknowledged me.

   He might well have said--"No, I have not come to this--to march at the
   head of such vagrant beggars as these!" Yet He received us graciously,
   according to His promise, "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast
   out." Since then, how graciously has He borne with us! We are not among
   those self-praising ones who have worked such wonders of holiness. We
   mourn our shortcomings and transgressions and yet He has not cast away
   the people whom He did foreknow. When we look back upon our character
   as soldiers of Christ, we feel ashamed of ourselves and amazed at His
   Grace. If anybody had told us that we would have been such poor
   soldiers as we have been, we would not have believed them. We do not
   excuse ourselves--we are greatly grieved to have been such failures.
   Yet our gracious Lord has never turned us out of the ranks. He might
   have drummed us out of the regiment long ago, but here we are, still
   enrolled, upheld and smiled upon. What a captain we have! None can
   compare with Him for gentleness. He still acknowledges us and He
   declares, "They shall be Mine in that day when I make up My jewels."

   Brothers and Sisters, let us exalt the name of our Captain! There is
   none like He. We have been in distress--and He has been in distress
   with us. Ziklag smoked for Him as well as for us. In all their
   affliction, He was afflicted. Have you not found it so? When we have
   come to a great difficulty like the brook Besor, He has gently eased
   His commands and has not required of us what we were unable to yield.
   He has not made some of you pastors and teachers, for you could not
   have borne the burden. He has abounded towards us in all wisdom and
   prudence. He has suited the march to the foot, or the

   foot to the march. How sweetly He has smiled on what we have done! Have
   you not wondered to see how He has accepted your works and your
   prayers? You have been startled to find that He answered your feeble
   petitions.

   When you have spoken a word for Jesus and God has blessed it, why, you
   have thought, "Surely there is a mistake about this! How could my
   feeble words have a blessing on them?" Beloved, we follow a noble
   Prince. Jesus is the chief among 10,000 for tenderness as well as for
   everything else. How tenderly considerate He is! How gentle and
   generous! He has never said a stinging word to us ever since we knew
   Him. He is that riches which has no sorrow added to it. He has rebuked
   us, but His rebukes have been like an excellent oil which has never
   broken our heads. When we have left Him, He has turned and looked upon
   us, and so He has cut us to the quick, but He has never wounded us with
   any sword except that which comes out of His mouth, whose edge is love.
   When He goes away from us, as David did from those 200 who could not
   keep up with him, yet He always comes back in mercy and salutes us with
   favor. We wonder to ourselves that we did not hold Him--and vow that we
   will never let Him go--but we wonder still more that He should come
   back so speedily, so heartily, leaping over the mountains, hastening
   like a roe or a young hart over the hills of division! Lo, He has come
   to us! He has come to us and He makes our hearts glad at His coming.
   Let us indulge our hearts, this morning, as we take our share in the
   precious spoil of His immeasurable love! He loves the great and the
   small with the same love-- let us be joyful all round!

   There is one choice thing which He will do, that should make us love
   Him beyond measure. David, after a while, went up to Hebron to be made
   king over Judah. Shall I read to you in the Second Book of Samuel, the
   second chapter and the 3rd verse? "And his men that were with him" (and
   among the rest, these weak ones who could not pass over the brook
   Besor), "and his men that were with him did David bring up, every man
   with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron." Yes, He
   will bring me up, even me! He will bring you up, you faintest and
   weakest of the band! There is a Hebron wherein Jesus reigns as anointed
   King and He will not be there and leave one of us behind! There is no
   Kingdom for Jesus without His brethren, no Heaven for Jesus without His
   disciples! His poor people who have been with Him in faintness and
   weariness shall be with Him in Glory, and their households. Hold on to
   that additional blessing! I pray you, hold on to it! Do not let slip
   those words--"and their households." I fear we often lose a blessing on
   our households through clipping the promise. When the jailer asked what
   he must do to be saved, what was the answer? "Believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and you shall be saved." You have heard that answer hundreds of
   times, have you not? Did you ever hear the rest of it? Why do preachers
   and quoters snip off corners from Gospel promises? It runs thus--"You
   shall be saved, and your house."

   Lay hold of that blessed enlargement of Grace, "and your house." Why
   leave out the wives and the children? Will you let the Amalekites have
   them? Do not be satisfied without household salvation. Let us plead
   this Word of the Lord this morning--O You blessed David, whom we have
   desired to follow, who has helped us so graciously even unto this day,
   when You are in Your Kingdom, graciously remember us, and let it be
   said of us, "and David went up there, and his men that were with him
   David brought up (they did not go up of themselves) every man with his
   household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron;" "Every man with his
   household." I commend those words to your careful notice. Fathers, have
   you yet seen your children saved? Mothers, are all those daughters
   brought in yet? Never cease to pray until it is so, for this is the
   crown of it all, "Every man with his household."

   What I have to say lastly is this--how greatly I desire that you who
   are not yet enlisted in my Lord's band would come to Him because you
   see what a kind and gracious Lord He is! Young men, if you could see
   our Captain, you would get down on your knees and beg Him to let you
   enter the ranks of those who follow Him! It is Heaven to serve Jesus. I
   am a recruiting sergeant and I would gladly find a few recruits at this
   moment. Every man must serve somebody--we have no choice as to that
   fact. Those who have no master are slaves to themselves. Depend upon
   it, you will either serve Satan or Christ, either self or the Savior!
   You will find sin, self, Satan and the world to be hard masters--but if
   you wear the livery of Christ, you will find Him so meek and lowly of
   heart that you will find rest unto your souls! He is the most
   magnanimous of captains! There never was His like among the choicest of
   princes!

   He is always to be found in the thickest part of the battle. When the
   wind blows cold, He always takes the bleak side of the hill. The
   heaviest end of the Cross always lies on His shoulders. If He bids us
   carry a burden, He also carries it. If there is anything that is
   gracious, generous, kind and tender--yes lavish and super abundant in
   love--you always find it in Him! These 40 years and more have I served
   Him, blessed be His name! And I have had nothing but love from Him. I

   8 The Statute of David for the Sharing of the Spoil would be glad to
   continue yet another 40 years in the same dear service here below if it
   so pleased Him. His service is life, peace, joy! Oh, that you would
   enter in it at once! God help you to enlist under the banner of Jesus
   even this day! Amen.

The Best Strengthening Medicine

   (No. 2209)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 21, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Out of weakness were made strong." Hebrews 11:34.

   THOSE who out of weakness were made strong are written among the heroes
   of faith and are, by no means, the least of them. Believers "quenched
   the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness
   were made strong." Who shall tell which of the three grand deeds of
   faith is the greatest? Many of us may never have to brave the fiery
   stake, nor to bow our necks upon the block, to die as Paul did, but if
   we have Divine Grace enough to be out of weakness, made strong, we
   shall not be left out of the roll of the nobles of faith--and God's
   name shall not fail to be glorified in our persons.

   Brothers and Sisters, as Believers in the Lord Jesus, we are called to
   two things, namely, to do and to suffer for His name's sake. Certain
   saints are summoned to active marching duty and others are ordered to
   keep watch on the walls. There are warriors on the field of conflict
   and sentries in the box of patience.

   Both in doing and in suffering, if we are earnest and observant, we
   soon discover our own weakness. "Weakness" is all we possess.
   "Weakness" meets us everywhere. If we have to work for the Lord, we are
   soon compelled to cry, "Who is sufficient for these things?" And if we
   are called to suffer for Him, our weakness, in the case of most of us,
   is even greater--many who can labor without weariness cannot suffer
   without impatience. Men are seldom equally skilled in the use of the
   two hands of doing and bearing. Patience is a Grace which is rarer and
   harder to come at than activity and zeal. It is one of the choicest
   fruits of the Spirit and is seldom found on newly-planted trees. The
   fact soon comes home to us that we are weak where we most of all desire
   to be strong.

   Our longing is to be able both to do and to suffer for our Lord--and to
   do this, we must have strength from above-- and that strength can only
   come to us through faith. I have read you this glorious 11th of Hebrews
   which describes the mighty men of faith, the men of renown. They
   accomplished all their feats by a power which was not in them by
   nature. They were not naturally strong either to do or to suffer. If
   they had been, they would not have required faith in God! But being men
   of like passions with ourselves, they needed to trust in the Lord and
   they did so. They were quite as weak as the weakest of us, but by their
   faith they laid hold on heavenly strength until they could do all
   things. There was nothing in the range of possibility, or, I might say,
   nothing within the lines of impossibility, which they could not have
   performed! They achieved everything that was necessary in the form of
   service and they bore up gloriously under the most fearful pressure of
   suffering, simply and only by faith in God, who became their Helper.

   You and I may be very weak at this time, but we can be made strong out
   of just such weakness. We need not wish to have any strength of our
   own, for by faith we can reach to any degree of power in the Lord! We
   can have all imaginable strength for the grandest achievements
   desirable, if we have faith in God. Upon this simple but most practical
   matter I am going to speak to you at this time. We all wish to be
   strong. Medicines, lotions, foods, baths and all sorts of inventions
   are advertised as means of increasing strength. We are all, in heavenly
   things, so weak that the idea of being made strong should be very
   attractive to us.

   Let us learn, then, how others "out of weakness were made strong." And
   let us follow on to enjoy their privilege by copying their conduct. Let
   me ask you to note, first, faith makes men strong for holy doing. And,
   secondly, faith makes men strong for patient suffering. We shall go
   over the ground which I marked out in my introduction.

   I. To begin with--FAITH MAKES MEN STRONG FOR HOLY DOING. Here, indeed,
   all our strength must come to us by faith in the thrice-holy God.

   The first duty of a Christian man is to obey God. Obedience is hard
   work to proud flesh and blood. Indeed, these ingrained rebels will
   never obey through our own efforts. By nature we love our own will and
   way and it goes against the grain for us to bring ourselves into such
   complete subjection as the Law of the Lord requires. "You shall love
   the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
   all your mind." Who among us has done this? Who among us can do this
   unless a power outside of himself shall come to his aid? Only faith
   takes hold of the Divine strength and only by that strength can we
   obey! Hence faith is the essential point of holiness. Ah, my dear
   Friend, if you start on the voyage of life, by Divine Grace, with the
   resolve that you will follow the track marked down on the chart by the
   Lord, your God, you will find that you have chosen a course to which
   the Lord's hands, alone, can keep you true!

   The current does not run that way. Before long you will find that the
   wind is dead against you and the course to be followed is hard to keep.
   What will you do, then, if you have not faith? When duty is contrary to
   your temperament, what will you do without faith? When it involves loss
   of money, or ease, or honor--what will you do, then, if you have no
   faith? If you believe that God is the Rewarder of them that diligently
   seek Him, you will persevere, but no other way. Suppose the right
   course should expose you to ridicule, cause you to be spoken of as a
   fanatic, or mocked at as a hypocrite, or despised as a fool--what can
   you do without faith? If you trust the living God, you will do the
   right thing and bear the loss or the shame. But if your faith fails
   you, self-love will create such respect for your own good name, such
   fear of ridicule, such unwillingness to be singular, that you will
   slide from your integrity and choose a smooth and pleasing road.

   Though you may think it a very ordinary thing to obey God in all
   things, you will find that a man had need to set his face like a flint
   in order to keep the right road--and the only way in which he will be
   able to hold on his way will be by having faith in God! Let him say,
   "God commands and, therefore, I must do it," and he will be strong! Let
   him feel, "God commands and, therefore, He will bear me through," and
   he will be strong! Let him say, "God commands and He will recompense
   me," and he will be strong! We are not saved by obedience, for
   obedience is the result of salvation! We are saved by faith, because
   faith leads us to obey! Faith is weakness clinging to strength and
   becoming strong through so doing. Faith in God made the cripple at the
   Temple gate stand, walk, leap and praise God--and even so does faith
   make our sin-crippled manhood obey the will of the Lord with
   exultation.

   Taking another view, we would remark that faith makes us strong to
   fulfill the relationships of life. We are not alone by ourselves and we
   can neither live nor die apart, for God has linked us with others. We
   either curse or bless those around us. If we have faith in God, we
   shall bless our children, as Isaac and Jacob blessed their sons. Faith
   leaves a legacy of benediction to its heirs. If you have faith in God,
   you may bless your brothers while you live, as Joseph did--faith has
   housed many a family which otherwise had starved. If you have faith in
   God, you can lead others out of the bondage of sin and through the
   wilderness world, as Moses led the children of Israel, for faith is a
   great guide. But you can do nothing aright for others without faith in
   God for yourself and them.

   Do I address a wife who has a godless husband? Have faith in God about
   him! Do not try to deal with your husband otherwise than by faith in
   God. If you attempt his conversion apart from heavenly power, you might
   as well try to take leviathan with a hook! Dear Father, have you
   children who are unruly, irreligious, defiant? Do the young men refuse
   to be advised? Are your girls light and trifling? Go to God in prayer
   and faith! He that knows the care of a household knows how easily a
   parent can do serious mischief with his children by his very efforts to
   do them good. One parent is too indulgent, another is too severe. Take
   the children to God, take them to God, I pray you! It is here that your
   strength lies. Strength to do right at the head of a household must
   come by Divine gift--and that gift will only be placed in the open
   hands of faith! If we believe for our whole house, the promise will be
   fulfilled to us and to our house, for it is made to faith. May faith
   enable us, each one, like David, to bless our household!

   Do I speak to a young apprentice here who fears God and who lives in an
   ungodly family? Do you feel bewildered as to how to behave yourself?
   Orders are given you which cause you great searching of heart. You have
   to question in your inmost soul whether you can conscientiously do as
   your employer requires. I beseech you, have faith in God that He will
   direct you and also have faith to follow that direction when you
   receive it! It is a very perilous spot, that beginning of life, when
   the youth first leaves the home of piety and finds himself where the
   fear of God is not in the place. If, as a decided Believer, he takes
   his stand--and if he is firm and steadfast for his God--he will make a
   man and his later years

   will be bright and useful. But if he begins to give way a little and if
   he tries to trim his sail to the wind, he will never attain to a holy
   character!

   We read of the children of Ephraim that, being armed, and carrying
   bows, they turned back in the day of battle and, therefore, they were
   never to be relied on in the time of war. He who is not firm at
   starting is cutting out for himself a poor pattern of life. That which
   begins with shamefacedness, equivocation, hesitation and compromise
   will ripen into apostasy. Such a wretched faith has no influence on the
   man's self and it will have no influence upon others! Father, mother,
   husband, wife, sister, brother, servant, master--whatever your
   relation, I beseech you, if you feel weak in the discharge of your
   duty, exercise faith in God about it--and out of weakness you shall be
   made strong!

   There is a high and blessed duty and privilege--I will call it
   both--which is to every Christian the necessity of his life, and that
   is to pray. Can you pray, my Brother? If you know how to pray, you can
   move Heaven and earth! Can you pray, my Brother? Then you can set
   almighty forces in operation! You can suffer no need, for everlasting
   supplies await the hands of prayer--"Ask, and it shall be given you."
   You cannot miss your way, for you shall be guided in answer to prayer.
   You shall hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk you
   in it." "O Sir," you say, "I cannot pray prevailingly." Then you are
   not like Jacob, good at wrestling. You cannot take hold upon the angel
   and win the victory. Do you feel in prayer as if the sinew of your
   strength were shrunk and your knee out ofjoint? Well, then, let me
   bring the text before you. Out of this weakness in prayer you can only
   be made strong by faith. Believe in God and you will prevail with God.
   Believe in His promise and plead it. Believe in His Spirit and pray by
   His help. Believe in Jesus, who makes intercession, for through Him you
   may come boldly to the Throne of Grace!

   Faith alone can repair feeble knees. "According to your faith be it
   unto you." To pray without faith is formality-- no, it is vanity! To be
   weak in prayer is a disease which will bring on many other maladies.
   Seek faith to become Masters of the Art of Prayer. I would rather be
   Master of the Art of Prayer than M.A. of both universities! He who
   knows how to pray has his hands on a leverage which moves the universe.
   But there is no praying without believing. If you believe not, you may
   be heard--it is more than I can promise you. But if you believe, you
   shall be heard, for God refuses no believing prayer! To refuse to keep
   His own promise when it is pleaded would be to falsify His Word and
   change His Character-- and neither of these things can ever be!

   Have you strong confidence--"He that spared not His own Son, but
   delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not, with Him, also freely
   give us all things?" Jesus said, "If you, then, being evil, know how to
   give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father
   which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask Him?" Believe in
   prayer and you will pray believingly! Some do not think that there is
   much in prayer. Poor souls! May the Lord teach them better! O my
   Brothers and Sisters, believe up to the hilt in prayer and you will
   find it to be the most remunerative work on earth! He that trades with
   God in prayer enters upon a business whereof the merchandise is better
   than silver or gold! Prayer makes us "rich towards God," and this is
   the best of riches--but it must be believing prayer. "Let him ask in
   faith, nothing wavering." Have you a poor, faint heart in this sacred
   exercise? Be assured that only by faith, out of this weakness, can you
   be made strong.

   It may be that certain of my hearers feel that they cannot attain to
   the matters I have mentioned, for they are as yet battling to reach the
   position of servants and pleaders. Faith is the great force which is
   needed by those whose principal work is to overcome sin. When God began
   with many of us, He found us very low down beneath the flood of evil.
   It may be that an awful temper broke over us in surging waves. We have
   to rise superior to it. Possibly He found us plunged in the great deeps
   of an evil habit. Was it drunkenness? Was it gambling? What was it? It
   had to be left beneath--we were called to rise out of it. Some are
   permitted to sink a long way down in sin--and when God begins with
   them, they have a desperate ascent even to reach common morality--what
   must the conflict be before they attain to spirituality and holiness?
   It is hard for those to rise to the surface who have been plunged in
   the deeps. If a man has been sunk down in black waters full of filth, a
   thousand fathoms deep, and if he has been long imprisoned in dark caves
   where no light has come, what a wondrous power would that be which
   should raise him to the sunlight!

   The Spirit of God comes to many when they are in much the same
   condition. And what a work it is to bring them up from the horrible
   midnight and to give strength to rise out of the inky waters! I have
   seen many a soul wearying to as-cend--receiving a little light and a
   little more light and a little more light--but yet far from being clear
   of the dark waters of iniquity! Dear Struggler, you will never overcome
   sin except by faith in Jesus Christ. Trust Him! Trust in the pre-

   cious blood--that is the great sin-killer! Trust His pierced hands to
   pierce the hands of your lusts. Trust His wounded side to cut through
   the heart of your evil desires. Your hope lies there--where Jesus died,
   where Jesus rose again, where Jesus has gone into Glory. You may
   resolve to overcome a sin and, perhaps, any one sin you may conquer for
   a time. But sin itself, as a force, in all its armies, is never to be
   overcome, save through the blood of the Lamb! You will never be able to
   cut down this huge upas tree except with the axe of Christ's atoning
   Sacrifice. Take that and every blow will tell, but no other instrument
   will avail! God strengthening you, you shall, out of weakness, be made
   strong to overcome sin, though it is backed by the world, the flesh and
   the devil. Entrenched in your nature, though your sins may be, you will
   drive out these Canaanites and free your heart from their dominion!

   I have often met with persons awakened by Divine Grace to see the evil
   of a certain act and they have said, "I do not know how I shall ever
   break off the habit." Yet they have very easily escaped from it. I
   remember one who was very foul-mouthed and habitually used oaths. I
   hardly think that, for years, he had spoken without ill language and
   yet, from the moment he turned unto the Lord, he never used an
   oath--and he also noted that he never had a temptation to do so! I
   remark that the particular form of sin known as blasphemy is one of the
   first to die and to be buried out of sight. Other sins die hard, but
   this is shot through the head by true repentance and faith in Jesus!
   Some sins cling to a man like the fabled tunic of Hercules which could
   not be torn away, but burned into his flesh and bones whatever he might
   do. How long a well-beloved habit lingers at the door after the heart
   has given it a bill of divorce! As a dog, which is chased away from the
   house, returns again and again to its former master, so does an evil
   lust return even to the soul that loathes it. How weak we are in this
   matter! How slow to cut off right hands and pluck out right eyes! But
   yet it must be done and only faith can do it--by calling in the aid of
   the Almighty One. Trust in Christ to overcome, by His Spirit, that
   which He has put away by His death. In Him we shall find succor--and by
   faith out of weakness we shall be made strong!

   I change the run of my discourse altogether by remarking that there is
   another thing that falls to the lot of Christian men, a matter of the
   very first importance, namely, to spread the Gospel. "Yes," says one,
   "I acknowledge that it is an urgent service to make known to others
   what the Lord has done for me, but, somehow, I cannot discharge my
   conscience by fully doing as I would. I tried the other day to say a
   good word and I am afraid that I made a failure of it. I stammered a
   good deal and I said little that I thought to say--and some things I
   said seemed to weaken what I did say. I resolved, the other day, that I
   would see a man whom I had known, and tell him that I was a changed
   character. But when I reached his house, I drifted into other talk and
   went the way in which he led me. I could not come to the point."

   Many would make a similar confession if they made a clean breast of it.
   Many of the truest children of God are, at first, possessed by a dumb
   spirit and it needs the Lord Jesus to cast it out. But do you not think
   that we are too apt to attempt to spread the Gospel in our own
   strength--and need we wonder if we break down? If we were by faith to
   begin, humbly waiting upon the Lord for words, and taking hold upon
   Divine strength, might we not accomplish far more than we now do? I
   have heard of one brought to Christ who was a very great sinner--of so
   stiff a neck that he never would be approached by anybody who aimed at
   his conversion. He hated the very mention of religion! He answered all
   appeals very coarsely. But one of his neighbors felt forced to go to
   him very early in the morning and to say to him, "I beg your pardon for
   intruding so early, but I lay awake all last night thinking about you;
   and I cannot rest till I tell you something."

   He answered, "What were you thinking about me for? I don't need any of
   your thoughts." "Oh," said the other, "I felt so sorry to think that,
   if you were to die, you would die without hope, that I was obliged to
   come to you." The bearish man grumbled, "Mind your own business."
   "But," said the other, "it is my business. I think my heart will break
   unless I see you saved." All the answer was, "Go away with you. Don't
   come here with your cant!" The Brother went home weeping, but he was
   not the only one who felt his heart breaking. The bearish one went away
   from his forge and said to his wife, "I can always answer these
   religious fellows. I do not care for your parsons a bit. but that
   neighbor of ours has been in here and he says he shall break his heart
   unless I am converted--and that beats me." He was beaten. Out of a sort
   of kindly pity for his neighbor's weak-mindedness, with a mixture of an
   unacknowledged feeling on his own account, he went to hear the
   preaching of the Word of God and was brought to Jesus!

   "But," says one, "I know if I were to try to speak to any of my
   neighbors, I should break down." Friend, I am not careful in that
   matter, nor need you be. If you are in real earnest, you might possibly
   do more by a break-down than by anything else. Only break the ice and
   begin--and you shall find my text to be true in your case, also, and
   out of weakness

   you, too, shall be made strong! God does not need your strength--He has
   more than enough power of His own! He asks for your weakness--He has
   none of that, Himself, and He is longing, therefore, to take your
   weakness and use it as the instrument in His own mighty hands! Will you
   not yield your weakness to Him and receive His strength?

   Permit me to speak to some aspiring spirit here, and say--Dear Friend,
   would you like to do something great for God? Have you heard the motto
   of our early missionaries--"Attempt great things for God"? Does that
   thought burn within your heart? Do you long to be of some use? "Oh,
   yes," says one, "I would attempt great things for God, but I am
   terribly weak." Make the attempt by faith in God, for it is written,
   "Out of weakness were made strong." If you feel incapable, throw
   yourself upon the infinite capacity of God! So long as you are willing
   to be used. So long as God has given you an anxiety and travail of
   spirit for the souls of others, you need not fear, but may, with faith,
   get to work in all your feebleness, for as your day your strength shall
   be! Has not the Lord said, "My Grace is sufficient for you: for My
   strength is made perfect in weakness"? And is not that Word of God
   true?

   I would make one more application of my text, which is capable of being
   used in a thousand directions. "Out of weakness were made strong." This
   will be experienced in bearing witness for the Truth of God. Suppose
   that you are called to testify for the Truth of God in the midst of
   those who doubt, disbelieve, or even deride it? You look to those who
   agree with you and they are lukewarm. You turn to old associates and
   they do not share your concern. Friends tell you that you are making
   much ado about nothing, or that you are uncharitable, narrow-minded and
   bigoted. I need not repeat the accusations--they have been so often
   hurled at myself that I know them by heart! They say, "The man was born
   too late! He is behind the age! He fights for a worn-out creed! He is
   out of place in a world of progress!" What then? Is there anything
   galling to you in all this? Indeed there is, unless faith is
   strong--and then the bullets turn to pellets and the stones are soft as
   sponges!

   When they talk to you like that, do not begin bristling up and
   declaring that, after all, you are as wise and as strong as your
   opponents, though that may readily be the case, but accept all their
   remarks upon your folly and weakness and say to yourself, "Out of
   weakness were made strong." Hold to God's Word by faith and you will be
   strong! God will vindicate His own cause, but it may be His way to let
   error prevail for a while. Bide your time when the cause is an eternal
   one, for you can afford to do so. If we had been in Egypt at the time
   when Pharaoh started out to follow the Israelites to the Red Sea. If we
   had been clothed with all power, we would have stopped Pharaoh's
   chariots and horses before they left Egypt--and thus we should have
   nipped his enterprise in the bud. We would have taken off the chariot
   wheels at once, so that they could not follow after the children of
   Israel. That is what we would have done, but Jehovah did something
   better! He allowed the Egyptians to pursue, overtake and threaten to
   divide the spoil--and He allowed them in their pride to go down after
   Israel into the depths of the sea!

   Then, and not before, He overthrew them, so that Israel sang, "The
   horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea." This was a grand thing
   for the tribes in their later journeys through the wilderness. The
   timid Israelites would always have been afraid that Pharaoh would
   follow them and capture them, but when the forces of Egypt and all her
   chosen captains were drowned beneath the waves, all fear of them was
   gone forever! The victory was complete. Meanwhile, the tremendous blow
   made their future antagonists in Canaan to tremble. In the conflict
   with evil, we would overcome it early and put it to the rout at the
   first attack. But it may be that God will allow error to proceed
   further and let it seem to triumph, so that by its own presumption it
   may place itself where it may be the more effectually crushed, never
   again to afflict the Church.

   It is for us, in our weakness, to go forward as the Lord leads us--and
   the day of the resounding timbrels and the twinkling feet will come in
   due time--and Jehovah will be magnified when even humble maidens "sing
   unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously." Be steadfast,
   unmovable! Never mind the craft, policy and number of the foe! God's
   time is best! He knows better than we do when to strike for victory.
   Out of weakness we shall be made strong if we fully rely upon the faith
   "once for all delivered to the saints."

   I would entreat you, each one, to make an application of the text to
   yourself in every work of faith and labor of love in which you may be
   engaged.

   II. Now, Beloved Friends, suffer me a few words upon the other cheering
   fact, namely, that FAITH MAKES MEN STRONG FOR PATIENT SUFFERING. The
   patience of hope is a very important part of Christian life and faith
   is the essence of it.

   Many are called to suffer much in daily life. Ah me, what a world of
   misery there is in this great city, among even good and gracious
   people! A man might study London till he turned his brain. The poverty
   and the suffering of even godly people in London would be a subject too
   harrowing for those of you who have specially tender hearts. Let us not
   forget those members of Christ's mystical body that are in the
   fire--"His feet are like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
   furnace." Few, if any, are without sorrow, and many saints have a
   double portion of grief in their pilgrimage. Sitting here with your
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, you look very cheerful, but I may be
   addressing those whose life is one protracted struggle for existence.
   Assuredly, you will not hold out without true faith--and much of it!
   You must endure, "as seeing Him who is invisible." You must joy in God,
   or you will not joy at all. Earthly comforts are not yours, but if you
   grasp the spiritual and the eternal, you will not repine.

   If in this life you only had hope, you would be, of all men, most
   miserable. But having that hope, you are among men most happy. The
   solitary place shall be glad for you and the desert shall rejoice and
   blossom as the rose. Commend me to firm faith for power to bear the
   daily cross! He that believes has everlasting life and the joys which
   come of it. Trust in your God, in His love to you, in His care of you
   and then you shall be as the lilies, which toil not, and spin not, and
   yet are clothed--or as the ravens which have no store and yet are fed.
   Behold, by faith, the Heaven prepared for you and know for sure that
   you will soon be there among the angels! And you will defy cold,
   hunger, nakedness, shame and everything else. Your faith, out of
   weakness, shall make you strong.

   Certain saintly ones are called to bear great physical pain and I
   commend to them, from practical experience, the power of faith in God
   under acute agony. This is the sweetest support in the presence of a
   threatened operation. How grim those surgeon's lancets seem! Ah me, I
   knew a patient once--I still know her--who, when the lancets had been
   used upon her, caused the doctor's case of instruments to be filled up
   with roses! God alone can help you to fill up with roses that grim
   memory of danger and suffering! Oh, how sweet to feel that if God has
   sent diseases to your house, He has made them a chariot in which
   benedictions have been brought to you! Go not to wine for comfort in
   the hour of depression! Above all things, dread the intoxicating cup in
   all its forms! You need not even appeal to friends for consolation.
   What do they know about your inward sorrow? There are seas of suffering
   which the sufferer must navigate alone. No other sail is within sight.
   Scan the horizon and nothing is to be seen but wave after wave. Now is
   the hour for faith in the great Lord who holds even lonely seas in the
   hollow of His hands. He knows your poor body and He permits it to be
   frail and permits your heart to be trembling because He will glorify
   Himself in His tenderness to your weakness, wherein He will make you
   strong! JEHOVAH-ROPHI is His name--"The Lord That Heals You." Give
   yourself up to Him and you shall yet sing of His loving kindness and
   tender mercies!

   But there are other forms of suffering than these of daily life and of
   bodily pain. Possibly I speak to some who are suffering the evils of
   persecution. No cruel tyrant can burn Believers now, nor even cast them
   into prison, for Christ's sake, but there are enough ways for the seed
   of the serpent to show its enmity to the seed of the woman. "Trials of
   cruel mockings" are still common. There are many ways in which the
   devil's whip can reach the back of the child of God. Persecution is
   still abundant and many a man's foes are of his own household. I will
   rehearse no stories of Christian women with jeering husbands, nor of
   godly youths who endure scoffing and far worse, but many a house is
   still a place of martyrdom. Gracious Sufferers, may the Lord keep you
   from anger and unkindness! By faith, alone, can you bear persecution
   and turn it to account for the good of others.

   Do not attempt to escape by yielding what is right and true, but ask
   the Lord to help you to stand fast for Him. If it is true that the Lord
   still has His martyrs, let it be seen that they are as brave as ever.
   Not now do they gather in the great amphitheater, where sits the
   emperor in state, with all the proud citizens of Rome in the nearer
   gallery, tier on tier, and the multitude up yonder gazing with their
   cruel eyes into the vast arena below. Not now do I see them lift up the
   great iron door and let loose the monsters that come forth roaring,
   hungry for their prey. Not now do I see, standing in the middle, a man
   and his wife and children, all unarmed. Not now do I hear the shouts of
   the mob, as they exult that Christians are given to the lions. This is
   all over. Christ, in His suffering members, has conquered Caesar and
   pagan Rome, for out of weakness Believers were made strong.

   A softer spirit has come over the human mind, but there is as much
   enmity against God as ever, and now it finds a less public arena and a
   meaner mode of torture. Today the tried one suffers alone and misses
   the encouragement of Christian eyes. At times he has to feel that it
   were better for him to fight with beasts at Ephesus than to bear the
   taunts, threats

   and slanders of ungodly kinsfolk. My Sister, my Brother, have faith in
   God in your hidden sorrow! Cry to Him in the secret of your soul and
   you will bear your load, yes, you will bear it calmly, and you will win
   those who hate you! Of your secret martyrdom, angels will be spectators
   and Christ will suffer in you--therefore, fear not. Out of weakness you
   shall be made strong by faith.

   We have among us those who are not exposed to persecution, but have to
   stand against assaults of unbelief. That which Believers in past ages
   have accepted as the Truth of God is not believed in many places,
   nowadays, and so it comes to pass that one brings to us a bit of
   skeptical science which he has picked up from Huxley or Tyndall.
   Another comes with a criticism that he has found in some of the modern
   divines who are the devil's instruments for spreading infidelity. And a
   third appears with a vile blasphemy from one of the coarser assailants
   of religion--and each one demands an immediate answer to his quibble,
   or his difficulty. Do they really expect that we are to answer, on the
   spur of the moment, every objection that they are pleased to raise? I
   confess that I do not believe that one human brain is capable of
   answering every objection that another human brain could raise against
   the most obvious truth in the world. Do not try to answer quibblers,
   but if you do, mind that faith is your weapon! If you take the wooden
   sword of your own reasoning, you may easily be beaten. Believe for
   yourself, because God has said it, and speak as the Lord guides you.
   Fix it in your mind, "This is God's Book. This is His Infallible
   Revelation and I believe it against every argument that can possibly be
   urged against it. Let God be true, but every man a liar." This will be
   sure defensive ground, but if you get off that rock, you will soon find
   yourself sinking or staggering! For an offensive weapon, take "the
   sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God"--and if this does not
   serve your turn, nothing will. Have a thorough, entire and childlike
   faith in the Revelation of the Most High and you will be made strong in
   those mental conflicts for which, in yourself, you are so weak.

   Again, it may be that I am speaking to sad ones who suffer under mental
   depression. Some of us are, by constitution, inclined to that
   condition. I have sometimes envied those good people who are never
   excited with joy and, consequently, seldom or never despond. "Along the
   cool, sequestered vale of life they hold the even tenor of their way."
   Happy people! At the same time, when I rise, as upon eagle's wings in
   joyous rapture, I feel right glad to be capable of the blissful
   excitement! Yet if you soar to the skies, you are very apt to drop
   below sea level. He that can fly, can faint. Elijah, after he had slain
   the prophets of Baal, was found fleeing into the wilderness from the
   face of Jezebel. If you are so constituted that you rise and fall. If
   you are a creature that can be excited and that can be depressed and,
   worse still, if you happen to have been born on a foggy day and to have
   swallowed so much of that fog that you have found it shading your
   spirit many a time since, then you can only be strong by faith!

   If you are one of those plants which seldom bloom with bunches of
   bright flowers, but have your blossoms hidden and concealed, be not
   disquieted. If you are never mirthful and seldom able to call yourself
   joyful--the only cure for depression is faith! Settle this in your
   heart--"Whether I am up or down, the Lord Jesus Christ is the same.
   Whether I sing, or whether I sigh, the promise is true and the Promiser
   is faithful. Whether I stand on Tabor's summit, or am hidden in the
   vale of Baca, the Covenant stands fast and everlasting love abides." Be
   assured, beyond all questioning, that he that believes in the Lord
   Jesus is not condemned! Believe in Him, though you see no flashes of
   delight nor sparkles of joy. We are safe because we are in the City of
   Refuge--not because we are, in ourselves, ill or well. If you will
   stand firm in Christ Jesus, even in your weakness you will be made
   strong!

   It may be that certain of you are called to suffer in your minds, not
   because of any wrong thing in yourselves, but for the sake of others.
   Some years ago I preached a sermon to you from the text, "My God, My
   God, why have You forsaken Me?" and in a mournful degree I felt what I
   preached, as my own cry. I felt an agony of spirit, for I was under an
   awful sense of being forsaken of God. And yet I could not understand
   why I was surrounded by such thick darkness. I wished to clear myself
   if any sin remained upon me, but I could not discover any evil which I
   was tolerating. When I went back into the vestry, I learned the secret
   of my personal distress, for there was an elderly man, in a horror of
   great darkness, who said to me, "I have never before met with any
   person who has been where I am. I trust there is hope for me." I bade
   him sit down and I talked with him. I saw him afterwards and I hope I
   guided him from the verge of insanity into the open, healthy place of
   peace through believing in my Master.

   I fear I should never have touched his case if I had not been in the
   miry clay myself. Then I understood why I must feel like one forsaken.
   The Lord was leading me where I would be taught to know my man and
   should be made willing to sit side by side with him in the dark prison
   house and lend him a hand to escape. Since then, in presenting myself
   to my Lord

   for service, I have said to Him, "Make me useful to the doubting and
   the feeble-minded. I do not bargain for comfort, peace and joy, if I
   can be more helpful to Your poor, weary children without them. Place me
   where I can best answer Your purpose by being made to sympathize with
   Your troubled people. I only want to bring them to Heaven, to the
   praise of the Glory of Your Grace. And as for me, let me rejoice or
   suffer, as best suits their case." For this a man must have faith in
   God and he must be sure that his trials, endured through his office,
   will have great recompense of reward. If you are chosen to be a leader
   and a helper, or a mother in Israel, be satisfied to endure hardness
   with the full belief that it is all right and that God will not only
   bring you through, but will also bless somebody else by the means of
   your tribulations.

   My time is ended, although I had much more to say. I can only pray the
   Lord to give you Divine Grace to believe in Him. If I should never
   again have the pleasure of speaking for my Lord upon the face of this
   earth, I should like to deliver, as my last confession of faith, this
   testimony--that nothing but faith can save this 19th Century--nothing
   but faith can save old England. Nothing but faith can save the present
   unbelieving church. Nothing but firm faith in the grand old Doctrines
   of Grace and in the ever-living and unchanging God can bring back to
   the Church a full tide of prosperity and make her to be the deliverer
   of the nations for Christ. Nothing but faith in the Lord Jesus can save
   you or me. The Lord give you, my Brothers and Sisters, to believe to
   the utmost degree, for His name's sake! Amen.

The Agreement Of Salvation By Grace With Walking In Good Works

   (No. 2210)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 28, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship,
   created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained
   that we should walk in them" Ephesians 2:9,10.

   I shall call your attention to the near neighborhood of these two
   phrases, "Not of works" and, "Created in Christ Jesus unto good works."
   The text reads with a singular sound, for it seems strange to the ear
   that good works should be given such a negative description as to the
   cause of salvation and then should be spoken of as the great end of it!
   You may put it down among what the Puritans called, "Orthodox
   Paradoxes," if you please, though it is hardly so difficult a matter as
   to deserve the name.

   Not long ago, I tried to handle the point of difference supposed to
   exist between the doctrine of faith--"Believe, and you shall be saved,"
   and the doctrine of the new birth and its necessity--"You must be born
   again." My method was on this wise--I did not explain the difficulties
   which appear to the logician and the doctor of metaphysics, but I tried
   to show that, practically, there were none. If we deal only with
   difficulties which block up the way to salvation, there are none. As
   for those matters which involve no real hindrance, I leave them where
   they are. A rock which is in nobody's way may stand where it is. He
   that believes in Jesus is born again. These two things are equally
   true--there must be a work of the Spirit within, yet he that believes
   in the Lord Jesus has everlasting life.

   Now, there is a contention always going on about the doctrine of good
   works, but instead of taking one side or the other, we shall try to see
   whether there is really anything to quarrel over if we keep to the
   Scriptures. We insist upon it, with all our might, that salvation is
   "not of works, lest any man should boast." But, on the other hand, we
   freely admit and earnestly teach that, "without holiness no man shall
   see the Lord." Where there are no good works, there is no indwelling of
   the Spirit of God! The faith which does not produce good works is not
   saving faith--it is not the faith of God's elect--it is not faith at
   all in the Scriptural sense. I have just taken these two points to
   bring them forward for the help and comfort of beginners. I seek not to
   instruct you who are already well taught, but my aim at this time is to
   instruct beginners on this important subject. Salvation is not of
   works, but, at the same time, we, who are the subjects of Divine Grace,
   are "created in Christ Jesus unto good works." This is plain to the
   enlightened Believer, but babes in Grace have weak eyes and cannot at
   once perceive it.

   Before, in the gracious Providence of God, Luther was raised up to
   preach the doctrine of Justification by Faith, the common notion among
   religious persons was that men must be saved by works--and the result
   was that, knowing nothing of the root from which virtue springs, very
   few persons had any good works at all! Religion so declined that it
   became a mere matter of empty ceremony, or of useless seclusion and, in
   addition, superstition overlaid the original Truth of the Gospel, so
   that one could hardly find it out at all. The reign of
   self-justification and priestcraft led to no good result upon the
   masses of religious people. Indulgences and forgiveness of sins were
   hawked through the streets and publicly sold. So much was charged for
   the pardon of one sin and so much for another, and the treasury of "his
   holiness" at Rome--who might better have been called, "his
   unholiness"--was filled by payments for abating penalties in a
   "purgatory" of Rome's inventing!

   Luther learned from the sacred Volume, by the Spirit of the Lord, that
   we are saved by Grace, alone, through faith--and, having found it out,
   he was so possessed by that one Truth of God that he preached it with a
   voice of thunder! His witness on that one point was so concentrated
   that it would be too much to expect equal clearness upon all other

   Truths of God. I sometimes compare him to a bull who shuts his eyes and
   goes straight on at the one objective which he means to overthrow. With
   a mighty crash, he broke down the gates of Papal superstition! He saw
   nothing--he did not need to see anything--except this--"By Grace are
   you saved through faith." He made very clear and good work upon that
   point, faulty as he was upon certain others. The echoes of his manly
   voice rang down the centuries. I note that nearly all the sermons of
   Protestant divines, long after Luther, were upon Justification by Faith
   and, whatever the text might be, they somehow or other brought in that
   article of a standing or falling Church. They seldom finished a sermon
   without declaring that salvation is not by works, but that it is by
   faith in Jesus Christ.

   I do not censure them for a moment! Far rather do I commend
   them--better too much than too little upon the central doctrine of the
   Gospel. The times needed that point to be made clear to all comers and
   the Reforming preachers made it clear. Justification by Faith was the
   nail that had to be driven home and clinched--and all their hammers
   went at that nail. They were not nearly so clear and specific upon many
   other doctrines as they were upon this, but then it was a foundation
   stone and they were occupied in laying it--and they did lay it and laid
   it thoroughly--and laid it forever. Still, they would have more fully
   completed the circle of revealed Truth if Sanctification had been as
   fully apprehended and as clearly explained as Justification. It had
   been well if the legs of the Gospel of the Reformation had been equal,
   for one was a little longer and a little stronger than the other and,
   therefore, there was a limp--a halting like that of victorious Israel,
   as he came from Jabbok--but still a limp which it would be well to
   cure.

   We have passed beyond the stage of dwelling too much on that cardinal
   doctrine and I greatly fear that in these times we do not have enough
   preaching of Justification by Faith. I could wish the Lutheran times
   back, again, and that the old thunders of Wittenberg could be heard
   once more. And yet I shall be glad if everything that is practical in
   the Gospel shall also have its full sphere allotted to it. The
   duties--let me rather say, the high and holy privileges--which come to
   us as children and servants of God--these should be maintained and
   fully preached, side by side with the blessed Truth of God embodied in
   those lines--

   "There is life in a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for you."

   I shall dwell, first of all, upon the first point of the text, which is
   this, "Not of works," or, the way of salvation. "Not of works" is a
   negative description, but within the negative there lies very clearly
   the positive. The way of salvation is by something other than our own
   works. Secondly, I shall speak about the walk of salvation. We who are
   saved, walk in holiness, for we are, "created in Christ Jesus unto good
   works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them." It
   is a decree of the Sovereign Lord that His chosen should be led to walk
   in holiness!

   I. First, then, THE WAY OF SALVATION is negatively described as, "Not
   of works." To this many take exception, but that we cannot help--the
   Scripture is plain enough. We are told that we ought not, on any
   occasion, allow persons to sing--

   "Sinner, nothing do, Either great or small, Jesus did it, did it all,
   Long, long ago."

   Great exception has been taken to that expression, but I believe that
   if the same Truth of God had been expressed in any other words, the
   same objection would have been raised, for it is the Truth that is
   objected to, rather than the words in which it is set forth! My text
   itself would be, to such persons, very objectionable--"Not of works."
   They are ready to rail at Paul for speaking thus evangelically. They
   hate the doctrine of salvation all of gift and not in the least of
   merit--a doctrine which we love! We preach salvation, "not of works."
   We repeat the teaching again and again, and mean to repeat it
   continually till we die! Salvation is of the Lord's mercy and not by
   works of the Law.

   If we were to preach that salvation is of works, we should please many
   fine folk; but as we do not know that it would be at all to their
   benefit that they should be pleased, we shall not brush one hair of our
   head in a different way from that in which it grows, to please
   them--much less shall we keep back, or explain away, the fundamental
   Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ--and that for several reasons.

   If we were to preach to sinners, dead in trespasses and sins, that
   salvation would be by their own works, we should be setting aside the
   way of salvation by Grace. There cannot be two ways of salvation for
   the same people! If we take to the one, we practically deny the other.
   It cannot be questioned that a guilty man, if saved at all, must be
   saved through the

   mercy of God. It cannot be denied, also, that our Savior and His
   Apostles taught that we are saved by faith. A man must shut his eyes if
   he does not see this to be their teaching. If, then, I teach men that
   they can be saved by works, I have practically told them that salvation
   by Grace is a myth, a mistake, a mischievous error! I have set it
   aside, for, as I have said before, there cannot be two ways to
   Heaven--there cannot be more than one. If I set up the way of works, I
   shut up the way of Grace. If salvation is of merit, it is not of mercy!
   And if there is no salvation of men by the pure mercy of God, what an
   unhappy case are we in! To deny Grace is really to deny hope. Where,
   then, would there be any Gospel, or glad tidings, or good news?

   The way of salvation by works is not "news." It is the old way of man's
   devising which is the general and well-known error of all the ages.
   Moreover, it is not, "good news," or glad news, for there is nothing
   good or glad in it. That we shall be rewarded for our works is nothing
   more than the heathens taught! Justification by religious performances
   and meritorious deeds is nothing better than the old Phariseeism with a
   Christian name stuck upon it! It is not worth revealing by the Spirit
   of God, for it is to be seen by the light of man's own candle. That
   doctrine makes the Lord Jesus Christ to be practically a nobody, for if
   salvation is of works, then the way of salvation through faith in our
   Savior is superfluous and even mischievous.

   Next, to preach the way of salvation by works is to propose to men a
   way in which they have already failed. If you are to be saved by works,
   you must begin very early--you must begin before you sin--since one sin
   decides the matter. But already you have commenced to break the Law of
   God. I am not addressing persons who have yet to start upon the way,
   for they have started already. You are a good way on the road, one way
   or other, and since you began in the way of works, what a failure you
   have already made of it! Is there anyone here who can claim that he is
   already saved by works, as far as he has gone? Has anyone among you
   been without sin? Look at your lives! Examine your consciences! Observe
   your words, your thoughts, your imaginations, your motives--for all
   these come into the account!

   Is there a man or woman here that does good and sins not? Scripture
   declares that "there is none that does good, no, not one." "All we like
   sheep have gone astray; we have turned, everyone, to his own way." The
   way of salvation cannot, therefore, be by following a road from which
   we have already so sinfully and steadily departed. If you were perfect
   as Adam was before he sinned, you might follow the way of works and be
   safe--but you are not in that condition. If I could be sent to an Adam
   and an Eve altogether unfallen, I might propose to them the way of
   salvation by obedience to the Law--but you have fallen and your nature
   is inclined to forsake the right way. The very garments that you wear
   show that you have discovered your shame. The daily labors which weary
   you prove that you are not in Paradise. The very preaching of the
   Gospel implies that you are in a sinful world! You are not possessed of
   an unbiased will, or inclined to that which is good--you have chosen
   the evil and still continue to choose it--therefore I should only be
   proposing to you a road in which you have already stumbled. And I
   should be setting you a task in which you have already broken down.

   And, next, I think it will be admitted by all, that the way of
   salvation by good works would be self-evidently unsuitable to a
   considerable number. I will take a case. I am sent for, in an
   emergency, and it is the dead of night. A man is dying, smitten
   suddenly by the death-blast. I go to his bedside, as requested.
   Consciousness remains, but he is evidently in mortal agony. He has
   lived an ungodly life--and he is about to die. I am asked by his wife
   and friends to speak to him a word that may bless him. Shall I tell him
   that he can only be saved by good works? Where is the time for works?
   Where is the possibility of them? While I am speaking, his life is
   struggling to escape! He looks at me in the agony of his soul and he
   stammers out, "What must I do to be saved?" Shall I read to him the
   Moral Law? Shall I expound to him the Ten Commandments and tell him
   that he must keep all these? He would shake his head and say, "I have
   broken them all; I am condemned by them all!" If salvation is of works,
   what more have I to say? I am of no use here. What can I say? The man
   is utterly lost! There is no remedy for him. How can I tell him the
   cruel dogma of "modern thought" that his own personal character is
   everything? How can I tell him that there is no value in belief, no
   help for the soul in looking to Another-- even to Jesus, the
   Substitute? There is no whisper of hope for a dying man in the hard and
   stony doctrine of salvation by works!

   If salvation had been by works, our Lord could not have said to the
   thief, dying at His side, "Today shall you be with Me in Paradise."
   That man could do no works! His hands and feet were fastened to the
   cross and he was in the agonies of death. No, it must be of Grace,
   all-conquering Grace--and the modus operandi must be by faith, or else
   for dying men

   the Gospel is a mockery! The man must look and live! The expiring
   sinner must trust the expiring Savior. As life ebbs out, the penitent
   must find life in Jesus' death. Is it not clear that the Gospel of
   works is unsuitable in such a case as this? Now, a Gospel which is
   unsuitable to anybody is not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Yes,
   I put it plainly. A Gospel that does not suit everybody does not suit
   anybody--and if it suits any class and condition really and truly, it
   must suit all classes! I think I have told you that, on one occasion, I
   had a letter which was intended to be very irritating to me, from some
   rather eminent, aristocratic gentleman who said that he had read some
   of my sermons when he was out on the coast of Africa and he found that
   certain black fellows out there--certain, "niggers"--delighted in them
   very much. He wrote to inform me that I was a very competent preacher
   for "niggers."

   I accepted the assurance at once as a very high compliment! I felt
   that, if I could preach to "niggers," I could preach to anybody and
   that, if the Gospel that I preached was suitable to the natives on the
   coast of Africa, it would certainly suit the people in London! If those
   who are afar off could understand it, you, who are near, could also
   understand it! The Gospel was not sent into the world to be a patent
   medicine that could only be purchased by the wealthy, or a spell that
   could only be uttered by Latin scholars. It is a Gospel for all ranks
   and conditions of men--and if I prove that what you call the Gospel is
   unsuitable for the dying, or is unsuitable for the ignorant--it is NOT
   the Gospel of Jesus Christ! The Gospel of salvation by Grace, through
   faith, is suitable for every class of persons that we have to deal
   with! Sinful habit has bound in iron fetters many of our fellow
   citizens and the Gospel can free them! Be the habit drunkenness, or
   profanity, or what it may, the habit holds them fast--and the Prophet
   says, concerning habit, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots? Then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do
   evil."

   To what purpose, then, do I cry to the leopard, "Change your spots," or
   to the Ethiopian, "Change your skin"? I must bring a superior force to
   bear upon the leopard or the Ethiopian before this can be accomplished!
   And there is no force in mere exhortation. You may exhort a blind man
   to see as long as you like, but he will not see. You may exhort a dead
   man to live as long as you like, but he will not live through your
   exhortation! Something more is needed! The forces of natural depravity
   and the acquired habits of sin in many cases--I think you will admit
   it--put the doctrine of salvation by works out of court! And if out of
   court as to one, it is gone as to all, for there can be but one Gospel.
   Go through your convict settlements. Go through your jails and just see
   what you can do with a doctrine of salvation by good works! You will
   come home disappointed, however earnest may be your address. But go
   there and tell of Free Grace and dying love--and pardon bought with
   blood--and eyes that stream with tears, confessions of sin and cries
   for pardon will tell you that you have not spoken in vain!

   Further, dear Friends, if we go and preach salvation by works to men,
   we are preaching to them a way of salvation impossible to all because
   of the perfection of the Law. What are the good works that can merit
   Heaven? What are the good works that can ensure eternal life? These are
   not the easy things which some seem to imagine. They must be perfectly
   pure, continuous and unspotted. "The Law of the Lord is perfect." It
   condemns a thought and even the glance of an eye, as an act of
   criminality. "Whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed
   adultery with her already in his heart." The Law of God in 10 commands
   means much more than the bare words would imply--it deals with the
   whole range of moral condition, motive and thought. Dream not that its
   sweep includes only external acts--indeed, it does include externals,
   but, in very deed, the Ten Commandments are spiritual! They go right
   through the heart and search the inward parts of the spirit. The more a
   man understands the Law of God, the more he feels condemned by it--and
   the less does he indulge the dream that he, as he is, shall ever be
   able to keep it intact. With such foul hands as ours, how can we do
   clean work? With hearts so polluted, how can we be "undefiled in the
   way"? Nature rises no higher than its source and that which comes out
   of the heart will be no better than the heart--and that is, "deceitful
   above all things, and desperately wicked."

   The Law of God is one and if you break it in any one point, you break
   it altogether. If, in a chain of 100 links, 99 should be perfect, yet
   if a single link anywhere in the chain should be too weak for the
   weight placed upon it, the load will fall to the ground quite as surely
   as if 20 links were snapped! One breakage of the perfect Law of God
   involves transgression against the whole of it! In order to be saved by
   works, there must be absolutely perfect, continuously perfect obedience
   to it in thought, word and deed. And that obedience must be rendered
   cheerfully and from the heart--for this is the heart of the first
   table--"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with
   all your soul, and with

   all your might." Can you keep that? Vain-glorious man, have you
   measured your moral strength against requirements so great and yet so
   just? Have you proved yourself equal to the task?

   Here is the heart of the second table--"You shall love your neighbor as
   yourself." Have you ever tried to do that-- to love your neighbor as
   yourself? You have been a little kind and sometimes generous, but the
   standard of loving your neighbor as yourself--have you ever reached to
   that? Has your charity been equal to your self-love? I do not believe
   that it has ever gone even half the way. Now, "What things soever the
   Law says, it says to them who are under the Law," and if it says all
   this to you and you cannot answer to its demands, how can you hope that
   you shall live by it? When a man fails to keep the Law of God, it
   condemns him! And its penalty--in other words, its curse--falls on him
   as justly his due. He that is under the Law is under the curse. All
   that the Law has to say to you is--"You have broken me and you must die
   for it." Read the curses written in the Book of Deuteronomy and
   remember that all these are pronounced over your head--

   "Look to the flames that Moses saw, And shrink, and tremble, and
   despair."

   And again, dear Friends, if we preach salvation by works, we shall take
   the minds of men away from a sense of their great need. Here is a
   person who has a terrible disease. He can be cured. The knife must be
   used, but if, instead thereof, I lay down for him rules of cleanliness
   and of general hygiene, I may do him some sort of good, but meanwhile
   he will neglect the chief evil, his disease will spread and will become
   fatal. What am I to do, if I am a surgeon? Must I not impress him,
   first, with the conviction that a serious operation is required, and
   that it must be submitted to? All the rest will be proper enough and
   even necessary, in due time, but I must do nothing to take his mind
   away from the great master evil that is destroying his life!

   The sinner must be told that he must be born again, that his nature is
   corrupt, that this corrupt nature must be destroyed, that a new nature
   must be created in him--to all this his mind must be turned! He must be
   made "a new creature" in Christ Jesus. And if I stir him up to eternal
   action, with a view to his salvation by it, I shall be taking his
   thoughts away from the inward evil of sin which is the very essence of
   the matter! O Sirs, if you had committed an offense against the
   government of your country and were found guilty and condemned to die,
   my first business with you would be to entreat you to ask pardon of
   your queen! I might come into your cell and say that I would have you
   dressed more respectably; would have you read such a book, or learn
   such a science--and this might be all very well--but the first thing
   you need is to have the sentence of death repealed! I will exhort you,
   my dear Hearers, to do everything that is honest, right and good, but
   there is something needed even more than this! You need to be cleansed
   from sin by the precious blood of Christ. You need to be renewed in
   heart by the Holy Spirit and you must turn your thoughts to these
   things! You first and most of all need the Lord Jesus! Look to him, I
   pray you! I dare not exhort you to do this work, or to do that, lest I
   distract your mind from Christ.

   The preaching of legal justification has no power over men.
   Congregations thus instructed are usually careless, worldly and devoted
   to carnal amusements. Those who hear about works feel as if they had
   now done enough and do not need to practice them. There is nothing in
   such doctrine to awaken anxiety, or move desire, or stir the depths of
   the soul. It has nothing Divine about it, nothing supernatural, nothing
   which can really raise the fallen, cheer the faint, or inspire the
   gracious. Without unction, life, or fire, a legal ministry is mere
   fiddling a tune to lame men, or setting forth a course of living action
   for a vault full of corpses. This point we know to be fact and,
   therefore, we shall not repeat the experiment.

   I am afraid that if we began to preach salvation by works, we would
   encourage pride in some and create despair in others. Many would think
   that they had done pretty well, as compared with other people--they
   would, therefore, right speedily wrap themselves up in a false hope.
   But others, knowing that they had not done well, as compared with other
   people, would think that there was no hope for them and so would sit
   down in despair. What practical purpose could this serve--to be making
   some more proud and others more wicked through the influence of despair
   upon them?

   But the very worst matter is that it would be taking them away from
   Jesus. Our business, my Brethren, is to hold up Jesus Christ! To what
   end did He die if men could be saved by their own works? It was a
   superfluity that He should hang upon the Cross if our own merits can
   open a way of salvation. How could the great God permit and even ordain
   such a death if we could be saved by our own merits? Why that bloody
   sweat? Why that nailing of the hands and feet? Why that, "Eli, Eli,
   lama Sabachthani?" if, of yourselves, you can be saved? But it is not
   so! You cannot save yourselves by efforts of

   your own and, therefore, we have to come to you, shutting you up to
   only this one thing--that you must be saved by faith in Him whom God
   has set forth to be a Propitiation for sin! You need the love of God!
   You need the power of the Holy Spirit! You need to be quickened into
   newness of life! You need to be helped to run in the ways of
   righteousness! In a word, you need everything until you come to Christ
   and everything that you need you will find in Him, and in Him, alone.

   Within yourselves there is nothing that you need. You may search, look
   and turn the dunghill of your nature over and over again, but you will
   never find the jewel of salvation there! That pearl of great price is
   in the Lord who assumed human nature, lived, loved, died and rose
   again--that He might redeem men from the Fall and all the sin
   consequent thereof. Oh, that you would look away from self once and for
   all! God forbid that the preacher should ever hold up anything else
   before you except the Crucified Savior, as Moses lifted up the serpent
   in the wilderness, bidding men look and live!

   To talk to unbelieving men about the possibility of salvation by their
   own works would keep them from eternal life. All that the life of
   nature can do will never suffice to produce a higher nature. Let the
   natural exert itself as it may, it will never rise to the spiritual!
   The best working horse does not, thereby, become a man--the best
   unregenerate man cannot, thereby become regenerate! There must be a new
   birth--and that comes by faith--not by works. To believe in Jesus is
   the entrance gate of the new life and there is no other door! If we, in
   any way, set you hunting about for another way, we shall cause you to
   miss the only one entrance and that will be to your soul's eternal
   loss! As we dread this, we more and more resolve to hold up the Cross
   and the Cross alone, and again and again we cry, "Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." God forbid that by our essays
   upon virtue, or, "the enthusiasm of humanity," we should distract you
   from hastening to the Lord Jesus, that He may give you rest, life and
   holiness! We want you to let your thoughts run, all of them, to Calvary
   and to that wondrous Person whose wounds upon the tree bleed healing
   for the wounds of sin-- and whose death is, for Believers--the death of
   the great evil power which once held them in bondage!

   Thus much upon a topic which we shall never wear threadbare and which
   we shall always continue to insist upon while life or breath remains,
   because it will always be needed while sinners remain on earth needing
   salvation.

   II. But now we come to this second most important part of the subject,
   namely, THE WALK OF SALVATION. Those who have believed in Christ and
   have been the subjects of the Spirit's work, are now, "created in
   Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that they
   should walk in them." God desires that His people should abound in good
   works. It is His great objective to produce a people fit to commune
   with Himself--a holy people with whom He can have fellowship in time
   and in eternity! He wishes us not only to produce good works, but to
   abound in them--and to abound in the highest order of them. He would
   have us become imitators of Himself as dear children, possessing the
   same moral attributes as the Father in Heaven possesses! Is it not
   written, "Be you perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is
   perfect"? Oh, that we came within measurable distance of this blissful
   consummation!

   Note in the text, first, that there is a new creation. One of the poets
   said of old that, "an honest man is the noblest work of God." That is
   not true unless we add to the word, "honest," an emphatic spiritual
   sense. A Christian man, however, is the noblest work of God. He is the
   product of the second creation. At first, man fell and marred his
   Creator's work, but, in the new creation, He that makes all things
   makes us new! Now, the objective of the new creation of our race is
   holiness unto the glory of God. You are not new-made in the image of
   the fallen Adam, but in the likeness of the second Adam! You are not
   new-created to sin--this cannot be imagined! The new creature sins not,
   for it is born of God. The new life is a living and incorruptible seed
   which lives and abides forever.

   The old nature sins and always will sin, but the new life is of God and
   it strives daily against the sin of the old nature and perseveres, and
   pushes forward towards everything that is holy, upright and perfect.
   Its instincts all run towards perfect holiness. The old nature does not
   care to pray, but the new nature prays as readily as we breathe. The
   old nature murmurs, but the new nature sings and praises God from an
   impulse within. The old nature goes after the flesh, for it is fleshly,
   but the new nature seeks the things of the Spirit, for it is spiritual!
   If you have been born again at all, you have been born unto holiness!
   If you have been new-created, you have been created unto good works! If
   this is not so with us, our religion is a mere pretence.

   This new creation is in connection with Christ, for we read in the
   text, "Created in Christ Jesus." We are the branches; He is the Vine
   out of which we grow! Your life and all your fruit-producing power lie
   in your union to Christ. You are

   not merely new-created, but you are created in Christ Jesus! It is not
   merely a change from a lower nature to a higher, but from separation
   from Christ to union with Him! What a wonderful thing that is--that you
   and I should not only be creatures in the world, but new creatures in
   Christ Jesus! Creatures we were in the first Adam, but our new
   creatureship is in the second Adam. Beloved, if you are what you
   profess to be, you are one with Jesus by that vital union which cannot
   be dissolved--and good works follow upon that union! Joined to Jesus by
   faith in Him, love to Him and imitation of Him, you walk in good works!
   Your creation to holiness is your creation in Christ Jesus. As you
   become one with the anointed Savior, His anointing ordains you to
   service and His salvation leads you into obedience. There cannot but be
   fruit on that branch which is vitally joined to that fruitful Stem,
   Christ Jesus, who did always those things which pleased the Father!

   Our good works must flow from our union with Christ by virtue of our
   faith in Him. We depend upon Him to make us holy. We depend upon Him to
   keep us holy. We overcome sin by the blood of the Lamb. We reach after
   holiness by the constraining love of Jesus. Love to Christ is the
   impelling cause of putting away first, one evil, and then another--and
   the energy enabling us to follow after one virtue and then another.
   Love to Christ burns like a fire in the breast that has conceived it
   and, as it burns, it makes the heart to glow and to become transformed
   to its own nature. You have seen a piece of iron put into the fire, all
   black or rusty, and in the fire it has gradually become red with heat
   and, as it has reddened, it has thrown off the scales of rust until, at
   last, it has looked to be, itself, a mass of fire. The effect of the
   love of God, shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit, is to burn
   off the rust and scales of sin and depravity--and we become pure love
   to God through the force of the love of God which takes possession of
   our being!

   Moreover, that love moves us to patient imitation of Christ. Do you
   know what that means? "The Imitation of Christ" is a wonderful book
   upon the subject which every Christian should read. It has its faults,
   but its excellences are many. May we not only read the book, but write
   it out anew in our own life and character by seeking in everything to
   be like Jesus! It is a good thing to put up in your house the question,
   "What would Jesus do?" It answers nine out of 10 of the difficulties of
   moral casuistry. When you do not know what to do and the Law does not
   seem very explicit upon it, put it so--"What would Jesus do?" Here,
   then, stands the case--by your creation in Christ you come to exhibit
   faith in Him, love to Him and imitation of Him--and all these are the
   means by which good works are produced in you! You are "created in
   Christ Jesus unto good works."

   Notice that creation unto these good works is the subject of a Divine
   decree--"Which God has before ordained that we should walk in them."
   This is God's decree! Am I ordained to eternal life? Answer the other
   question--"Am I ordained to walk in good works?" If I am ordained to
   good works, then I do walk in them and the decree of God is manifestly
   carried out in me! But if I make a profession of being a Christian,
   attend a place of worship and compliment myself upon my safety--while I
   am living in sin--then evidently there is no decree that I shall walk
   in good works, for I am living otherwise than that decree would have
   caused me to live. O Beloved, it is the eternal purpose of God to make
   His people holy! Agree with that purpose, with the freedom of your
   renewed will and with the delight of your regenerated heart! Concur in
   the will of God. Yes, vehemently desire, heartily pant after perfect
   holiness in the fear of God! Then may you, in the midst of severe
   struggles against temptation from outside and from within, fall back
   upon the decree of Predestination. Since it is God's decree that, as
   being new-created in Christ, I should be full of good works, I shall be
   so despite my old nature and despite my spiritual weakness! The decree
   in the new creature of God will be carried out despite my surroundings,
   despite the temptations of my circumstances, despite the opposition of
   the devil. God has before ordained that we should walk in good
   works--and we shall walk in them, sustained by His holy Spirit!

   So, then, dear Friends, these good works must be in the Christian. They
   are not the root, but the fruit of his salvation. They are not the way
   of the Believer's salvation--they are his walk in the way of salvation.
   Where there is healthy life in a tree, the tree will bear fruit
   according to its kind. So, if God has made our nature good, the fruit
   will be good. But if the fruit is evil, it is because the tree is what
   it always was--an evil tree. The desire of men created anew in Christ
   is to be rid of every sin. We do sin, but we do not love sin. Sin gets
   power over us, sometimes, to our sorrow, but it is a kind of death to
   us to feel that we have gone into sin. Yet it shall not have dominion
   over us, for we are not under the Law, but under Grace and, therefore,
   we shall conquer it and get the victory!

   The outcome of our union with Christ must be holiness. "What concord
   has Christ with Belial?" What union can He have with men that love sin?
   How can they that are of the world, who love the world, be said to be
   members of the Head

   who is in Heaven, in the perfection of His Glory? Brothers and Sisters,
   we must, in the power of the text, and especially in the power of our
   union to Christ, seek to make daily advances in good works which God
   has before ordained that we should walk in them, for walking means not
   only persevering but advancing. We should go from strength to strength
   in holiness--we should do more and do better. What are you doing for
   Jesus? Do twice as much! If you are spreading abroad the knowledge of
   His name, work with both hands! If you are living uprightly, seek to
   put away any relics of sin that abide in your character that you may
   glorify the name of God to the utmost.

   And, lastly, this should be our daily exercise--"That we should walk in
   them." Good works are not to be an amusement, but a vocation. We are
   not to indulge in them occasionally--they are to be the tenor and bent
   of our lives. "Oh," says one, "that is a hard saying!" Do you think so?
   Well, then, this displays and sets in clear light the first part of my
   subject. You see how impossible it is that you should be saved by these
   good works, do you not? But if you are saved--if you have obtained a
   present salvation, if you are now a child of God, if you are now
   assured of your safety, I charge you, by the love you bear to God, by
   the gratitude you have to His Christ--give yourself wholly to
   everything that is right, good, pure and just! Help everything that has
   to do with temperance, righteousness, truth and godliness! And "let
   your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
   glorify your Father which is in Heaven."

   May the Spirit of God seal this sermon upon the hearts of His people,
   for Christ's sake! Amen.

God Rejoicing in the New Creation

   (No. 2211)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 5, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold, I create new hea vens and a new earth: and the former shall
   not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and rejoice
   forever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a
   rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I wiil rejoice in Jerusalem, and
   joy in My people." Isaiah 65:17-19.

   THIS passage, like the rest of Isaiah's closing chapters, will have
   complete fulfillment in the latter days when Christ shall come, when
   the whole company of His elect ones shall have been gathered out from
   the world, when the whole creation shall have been renewed, when new
   heavens and a new earth shall be the product of the Savior's power,
   when, forever and forever, perfected saints of God shall behold His
   face and joy and rejoice in Him. I hope and believe that the following
   verses will actually describe the condition of the redeemed during the
   reign of Christ upon the earth--"There shall be no more thence an
   infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the
   child shall die an hundred years old. They shall build houses, and
   inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of
   them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,
   and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of My people,
   and My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not
   labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of
   the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them. And it shall
   come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are
   yet speaking, I will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,
   and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the
   serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy
   mountain, says the Lord."

   But the work which is spoken of in the text is already begun among us.
   There is to be a literal new creation, but that new creation has
   already commenced and I think, therefore, that even now we ought to
   manifest a part of the joy. If we are called upon to be glad and
   rejoice in the completion of the work, let us rejoice even in the
   commencement of it! The Lord Himself will joy and rejoice--and we who
   are in sympathy with Him are exhorted and even commanded to be
   glad--let us not be slack in this heavenly duty.

   Do you know what this work of creation is, which is here thrice
   promised in the words, "I create. . .I create . . .I create"? It is
   evidently a second creation, which is altogether to eclipse the first,
   and put it out of mind. Shall I tell the story?

   The first creation was so fair that when the Lord looked upon it, with
   man as its climax and crown, He said, "It is very good." But it failed
   in man, who should have been its glory! Man sinned and in his sin he
   was so connected with the whole of the earth that he dragged it down
   with him! The slime of the serpent passed over everything. The taint of
   sin marred the whole of God's work in this lower world. The creation
   was made subject to vanity and it groans in pain even now. But the
   Infinitely Blessed would not be defeated. And in infinite condescension
   He determined that He would make a new creation which would rise upon
   the ruins of the first. He resolved that under a second Adam, something
   more than Paradise should be restored to the universe. He purposed that
   He would undo, through Jesus Christ, the Seed of the woman, all the
   mischief that had been worked by the serpent. He has commenced to undo
   this mischief and to work this new creation--and so commenced that He
   will never withdraw His hand till the work is done.

   He has commenced it thus--by putting new hearts into as many as He has
   called by His Spirit, regenerating them and making them to become new
   creatures in Christ Jesus. These, the Apostle tells us, are a kind of
   first-fruits of this new creation. We are the commencement of the
   future ingathering. Our new-born spirits are the first ripe ears of
   corn out of a wonderful harvest that will come, by-and-by. The saints'
   spirits are, first of all, new-created, but their bodily parts re-

   main in the old creation. Hence we suffer pain, for though the Spirit
   is life because of righteousness, "the body is dead because of sin."
   By-and-by our bodies shall be new-created, when, from beds of dust and
   silent clay, we shall leap up into immortal beauty! The resurrection
   will be to the body what regeneration is to the soul. When body and
   soul are thus created anew, the whole earth around them in which they
   shall dwell, shall be, at the same time, also renewed. And so God shall
   make the spirits, the minds, the bodies and the abodes of men all new.
   These bodies, quickened by His Spirit who dwells in us, and united to
   souls purified and refined, shall tread upon an earth delivered from
   the curse and shall be canopied beneath new heavens! Have they not new
   desires? Should not all above them be new? They shall tread a new earth
   for they have new ways.

   Inasmuch as this ought to be the subject ofjoy and the text invites us
   to it, I come to press upon you the sweet duty of present delight! Oh,
   when happiness is made a precept, when joy is made a command, I cannot
   but hope that God's people, to whom I am now speaking, will answer the
   call! Has joy become a duty? Then we will be joyous! Has gladness
   become a precept? Then we will gladly enough obey and our heart shall
   dance for joy! I will read the text again and then we will consider
   what sort ofjoy it is which is to arise out of the work of Divine Grace
   in the new creation. "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and
   the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad
   and rejoice forever in that which I create: for, behold, I create
   Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in
   Jerusalem, and joy in My people."

   I. First, then, concerning the joy to which we are called, we would
   say, IT IS A JOY IN CREATION--"Behold, I create new heavens and a new
   earth. I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy."

   I must confess that I think it a most right and excellent thing that
   you and I should rejoice in the natural creation of God. I do not think
   that any man is altogether beyond hope who can take delight in the
   nightly heavens as he watches the stars and feel joy as he treads the
   meadows all bedecked with kingcups and daisies. He is not lost to
   better things who, on the waves, rejoices in the creeping things
   innumerable drawn up from the vast deep, or who, in the woods, is
   charmed with the sweet carols of the feathered minstrels. The man who
   is altogether bad seldom delights in Nature, but gets away into the
   artificial and the sensual. He cares little enough for the fields
   except he can hunt in them; little enough for lands unless he can raise
   rent from them; little enough for living things except for slaughter or
   for sale. He welcomes night only for the indulgence of his sins and the
   stars are not half as bright to him as the lights that men have
   kindled--for him, indeed, the constellations shine in vain!

   One of the purest and most innocent of joys, apart from spiritual
   things, in which a man can indulge, is a joy in the works of God. I
   confess I have no sympathy with the good man, who, when he went down
   the Rhine, dived into the cabin that he might not see the river and the
   mountains lest he should be absorbed in them and forget his Savior. I
   like to see my Savior on the hills and by the shores of the sea! I hear
   my Father's voice in the thunder and listen to the whispers of His love
   in the cadence of the sunlit waves. These are my Father's works and,
   therefore, I admire them and I seem all the nearer to Him when I am
   among them. If I were a great artist, I would think it a very small
   compliment if my son came into my house and said he would not notice
   the pictures I had painted because he only wanted to think of me. He
   therein would condemn my paintings, for if they were good for anything,
   he would be rejoiced to see my hand in them!

   Oh, but surely, everything that comes from the hand of such a Master
   Artist as God has something in it of Himself! The Lord rejoices in His
   works and shall not His people do so? He said of what He had made, "It
   is very good." And He cannot be very good, himself, who thinks that
   which God makes is not very good. In this he contradicts his God! It is
   a beautiful world we live in--

   "Every prospect pleases, And only man is vile."

   There are lovely spots on this fair globe which ought to make even a
   blasphemer devout. I have said, among the mountains, "He who sees no
   God here is mad!" There are things that God has made which overwhelm
   with a sense of His Omnipotence--how can men see them and doubt the
   existence of the Deity? Whether you consider the anatomy of the body,
   or the conformation of the mighty heavens, you wonder that the scorner
   does not bow his head--at least in silence--and acknowledge the
   infinite supremacy of God!

   Well, now, if there is--and I am sure there is--something pure and
   elevating in joy in God as the Creator of ordinary things--as the Maker
   of all this first creation--much more is there something bright, pure
   and spiritually exhila-

   rating in rejoicing in God's higher works, in God's spiritual works, in
   God's new creation! I think if a man feels within him a new heart and
   rejoices in his new birth. If he sees in others new and holier lives
   and rejoices in them. If he listens to the preaching of the Gospel and
   discovers in it new and better principles such as the old worn-out
   world could never have discovered--why, that man is a gracious man! The
   eye that can see the new nature is an eye that Grace has given and
   newly opened to new light. The heart that can rejoice in the new
   creation is a heart that is, itself, renewed, or else it would not
   comprehend spiritual things and could not rejoice in them. I invite
   you, therefore, dear Friends--you that see, know and somewhat
   appreciate the new creation in its beginnings--to joy and to rejoice in
   it tonight!

   It is a delightful thing that God should make a tree and bid it come
   forth in Spring with all its budding verdure. It is a far better thing
   that God should take a poor thorny heart like yours and mine--and
   transform it till it becomes like the fir tree or the pine tree to His
   praise. It is a charming sight when bulbs that have slept under ground
   through the winter, hold up their golden cups to be filled with the
   glory of the returning sun. But how much better that hearts that have
   lain dead in trespasses and sins should be moved by the secret touch of
   the Spirit of God to welcome the Sun of Righteousness and to rejoice in
   Him! How glorious to see a slum become a sanctuary, a den of thieves a
   house of God! This is even more wonderful than for darkness to become
   light and chaos yield to order. God's new creation, even in its
   beginnings here and now, is a something to delight one's soul in! I
   pray you, delight yourselves therein. Behold, in the creation of a new
   heart, the manifest finger of God! What power to turn the human
   will--to subdue fierce passions--to change the very core and center of
   the heart! This is power in the moral and spiritual world as great as
   anything which can be seen even in the convulsions of earthquakes.

   Herein is wisdom, too! We speak of the wisdom of God as seen in
   anatomy, in botany, or in astronomy. Yet this wisdom is still more to
   be seen in regeneration--in the making of the sinner who wandered from
   God to become a saint who follows after holiness--in the bringing of
   the opposer of Christ to become His friend and advocate. To rule the
   will and yet leave it free. To guide the heart and yet to let it
   choose. To reverse the law of being and yet to violate no law of man's
   nature--herein is the wisdom of the Highest, Himself! The attributes of
   God are to be seen in the visible creation, but they are to be seen in
   a brighter and superior light in the new creation. There is not one of
   the attributes of God which has not its illustration under the economy
   of Grace and, blessed shall your whole being be if you can, to the
   fullest, rejoice in that which God creates!

   There is one reason why you are called upon to rejoice in it, namely,
   that you are a part of it. When the angels saw God making this world,
   they sang together and shouted for joy--but they were not a part of
   this lower world. They had nothing to do with man's estate, but as a
   matter of sympathy. But as for this new creation of our gracious God,
   you and I, Beloved, who have believed in Jesus, are part of it! That
   same Grace which has quickened others into new life, has quickened us.
   The same Spirit who has given new principles and new desires to others,
   has also given them to us. The Father has begotten us, again, by the
   Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. We are the central beings
   of the new creation and so let us joy and rejoice in it with all our
   soul, mind and strength!

   I know, when I lay sorely sick and tormented in body, it seemed always
   to be such a joy to me that I, myself, my inner self, my spirit, has
   been new-created and that my nobler part could rise above the suffering
   and soar into the pure heavens of the spiritual realm! And I have said
   of this poor body, "You have not yet been new-created. Still does the
   venom of the old serpent taint you, but you shall yet be delivered. You
   shall rise again if you die and are buried, or you shall be changed if
   the Lord should suddenly come. You, poor body, you that drags me down
   to the dust in pain and sorrow, even you shall rise and be made anew in
   'the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body'--for the new
   creation has begun in me, even the earnest of the Spirit." O Beloved,
   can't you rejoice in this? I would incite you to do so. Rejoice in what
   God is doing in this new creation! Let your whole spirit be glad!
   Overflow with gladness! Let loose the torrents of praise! Leap down,
   you cataracts of joy!

   Well, that is our first point. It is a joy in creation.

   II. And, secondly, IT IS A JOY WHICH WILL ECLIPSE ALL THAT HAS GONE
   BEFORE.

   Now, my text is, "And the former shall not be remembered, nor come into
   mind." God's great new-creating work ought to fill us with such joy as
   to make us forget the old creation, as though we said to
   ourselves--"What are the sun and the moon? We shall not have need of
   these variable lights in the perfection of the new creation, for in
   Heaven, 'They need no candle, neither light of the sun.'" What is the
   sea, though it is the very mirror of beauty? In that new creation

   there will be no more sea--storms and tempests will be all unknown.
   What are these luxuries of sight and hearing? We shall not need them
   when our eyes shall behold the King in His beauty in the land that is
   very far off! The joy of the spiritual is such that, while it admits
   the joy of the natural, yet, nevertheless, it swallows it up as Aaron's
   rod swallowed up the rods of the magicians. In those last days we shall
   be in tune with Dr. Watts when he sang--

   "Lo! what a glorious sight appears

   To our believing eyes!

   The earth and seas are passed away,

   And the old rolling skies.

   From the third Heaven, where God resides,

   That holy, happy place,

   The new Jerusalem comes down,

   Adorned with shining Grace.

   The God of Glory down to men

   Removes His blessed abode,

   Men the dear objects of His Grace,

   And He their loving God.

   His own soft hands shall wipe the tears

   From every weeping eye,

   And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,

   And death itself shall die."

   As an instance of the expulsive power of a new delight, we all know how
   the memory of the old dispensation is gone from us. Brothers and
   Sisters, did any of you ever weep because you did not sit at the
   Passover? Did you ever regret the Paschal lamb? Oh, never, because you
   have fed on Christ! Was there ever a man that knows his Lord that ever
   did lament that he had not the sign of the old Abrahamic Covenant in
   his flesh? No, he gladly dispenses with the rites of the Old Covenant,
   since he has the fullness of their meaning in his Lord. The Believer is
   circumcised in Christ, buried in Christ, risen in Christ and in Christ
   exalted to the heavenly places! Did you ever regret the absence of the
   burnt offering, or the red heifer, or any of the sacrifices and rites
   of the Jews? Did you ever pine for the feast of tabernacles, or the
   dedication? No, because, though those were like the old heavens and
   earth to the Jewish believers, they have passed away, and we now live
   under new heavens and a new earth, so far as the dispensation of Divine
   teaching is concerned. The Substance is come and the shadow has
   gone--and we do not remember it.

   Now, I want you to feel just the same with regard to all your former
   life as you now feel towards that old dispensation. The world is dead
   to you and you to the world. Carnal customs and attractions are, for
   you, abolished, even as the ancient sacrifices are abolished. What were
   your sins? They are blotted out. The depths have covered them. You
   shall never see them again. Seek not after them as though you had a
   lingering esteem for them. Let them not come to mind except to excite
   you to repentance! What were your pleasures when you lived in sin?
   Forget them! They were flavorless, deceptive, destructive evils. You
   now have a higher pleasure which enchants your soul. What have been the
   sorrows of your past life, especially your sorrows while coming to
   Christ? You need not remember them, but, like the woman who remembers
   no more her travail for the joy that a man is born into the world, so
   your birth into the new creation causes you to forget all the
   sufferings of your spirit in coming there.

   "Old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new!" I
   would to God that the joy of the new creation would so fill us right up
   to the brim that we should not imagine any other joy! This puts out all
   other joy as the sun hides all the stars. Let all go! Let all go!
   Rolled up as the heavens and the earth are to be, like vestures all
   worn, let all of my past life be laid aside. Now put I on my new dress
   of sparkling joy and delight in the new things, for has not Christ made
   all things new to me? A new song is in my mouth, even praise to Him
   forevermore! A new Law is in my heart and a new service engages all my
   powers.

   There is great scope for enlargement here, but I will not linger, lest
   I chase away your joy by speaking about it unto weariness.

   III. In the third place, IT IS A PRESENT AND A LASTING JOY. "But be you
   glad and rejoice FOREVER in that which I create." Be now glad and now
   rejoice--it is a present joy. Take a delightful interest in that which
   God is now creating in the spiritual realm--though the work is only in
   the doing, yet be glad concerning it! Be glad in anything

   that the Lord has created in you. Has He created in you so much of the
   new life as to have produced conviction, repentance, faith in Christ,
   hope in the promise, longing for holiness? Be glad in this even if you
   have other circumstances pressing upon you and causing you to be heavy
   of heart. Though you might be mourning because you are so sickly, yet
   be glad that you are born again! If somewhat distressed because you are
   so poor, yet be glad that you are a child of God and have a place in
   the new family of love! Let the old things go and grasp the new, the
   heavenly. The old creation--bear with it a little longer, for the time
   of your redemption from its bondage draws near. Find your joy where God
   would have you find it, namely, in that part of your nature which is
   new, in the new principles, the new promises, the New Covenant and the
   blood of the New Covenant which are yours--all of them! Look no longer
   for the living among the dead, but let your heart dwell in the living
   world with your living Lord and be glad! The Kingdom of God is within
   you! Rejoice in it!

   And I want you, also, to find your joy in the new creation of God as
   you see it in others. The angels rejoice over one sinner that
   repents--surely you and I ought to do so! Try and do good and bring
   others to Christ--and when a soul shows signs of turning to its God,
   let that be your joy. "Be glad and rejoice in that which I create." I
   have had many rich draughts from this cup. I do not know anything that
   has made me so happy, hundreds and thousands of times in my life, as to
   see God at work in men's hearts and, without exaggeration, to hear of
   this one and of that one brought to Christ through the hearing or the
   reading of my sermons! It has been a Heaven to me! Oh, you may drink as
   much as you like of this cup of sympathy with God in His new creation
   work! There is no intoxication about it--to find a joy in the work of
   God in the hearts of others is healthy, unselfish delight!

   I know some snarling people who, if they hear of one being converted,
   say "they hope it is genuine," which, being interpreted, means that
   they do not believe it is--and they almost hope it is not. "Oh, but,"
   they say, if there is a great work done anywhere, "I never did like
   excitement! When I hear of many conversions, I expect many
   backsliding." Cold, dead fish that they are, excitement would not hurt
   them. A little boiling might do them good, perhaps. Yes, but if they
   meet with one who is an eminent Christian and whose public character
   will bear the closest inspection, they say, "Ah, well! We do not know
   what he is like at home." And so they have always some sly word to say
   against God's work, just like the serpent in Eden coming and hissing,
   "Yes, has God said?" I would far rather be one of those that can see
   the beauty of God's handiwork in my fellow Christians, than one who can
   spy out their defects.

   I think it is very beautiful where John Bunyan represents Christiana
   and Mercy as admiring each other. They had both enjoyed a wash in that
   wonderful beauty-giving bath and Mercy said to Christiana, "How
   beautiful you are! I never saw anyone look so lovely as you are." But
   Christiania said that she was not beautiful at all--she could not see
   anything about herself to admire, while in Mercy she saw everything to
   esteem and love. Oh, to have an eye for the work of God in other people
   and to rejoice in it! Such an eye sees not itself and yet it is,
   itself, one of God's loveliest works. "Be you glad and rejoice," says
   God, "in that which I create."

   Can we decline the sacred invitation? No, rather let us thankfully
   enter into the joy of our Lord! Be thankful for what God has done for
   yourself. Be thankful for what God is doing in other people. And
   remember that if you once begin this joy, you need never renounce it,
   for the text says, "Be you glad and rejoice forever." Every day and all
   day, this light of joy is shining, for the Creator stays not His hand!
   As long as you live there will be something in the new creation that
   shall be to you a wellspring of fresh joy and delight. Heaven will only
   enlarge this joy. Be glad forever because God will always be creating
   something fresh in which you may be glad!

   IV. Again, in the fourth place, it may be said of the joy which we
   ought to feel, that IT IS A JOY WHICH GOD INTENDED FOR US, "For,
   behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy." He has
   made the new city, the new people, the new world to be a source of joy!

   Take Jerusalem as the emblem of the Church of God. God always intended
   that His chosen, called and converted people should be a rejoicing. He
   created you on purpose, that you should, yourselves, be happy and bring
   happiness to others! Do you not know that His name is the happy God and
   nothing gives Him greater happiness than to give happiness to His
   creatures? Do you think you were chosen to be a groaner all your days?
   Were you called to misery, dear Brother, Sister? Does Jesus Christ say,
   "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will make
   you doleful"? Does He say, "Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, and
   you shall find agony in your hearts"? No! But He talks about rest,
   peace, joy and blessedness.

   One wrote to me, some years ago, and said that he came into this
   congregation and he felt at once that he must be in the wrong place
   because he found so large an assembly. God's people, he said, are a
   small remnant. There are few that shall be saved. He had settled that
   matter in his own expanded soul. But he was still more sure that he was
   in the wrong place when he looked at me, for I looked happy! And in his
   judgment, if I had known anything about the experience of a tried child
   of God, my face would have been much longer, more wrinkled and more
   sadly serious. I confess that my face does betray, at times, the fact
   that I am happy--but I cannot help it! But when this good man looked
   round on the great congregation--you were not all here then--but when
   he looked round on the vast congregation and saw them all looking so
   happy, he felt that he must get out of the building as soon as he
   could, for such smiling people could not be the afflicted people of
   God! He walked, he said, some distance along our streets, feeling heavy
   at heart because of the joy he had witnessed, but at last he reached a
   Chapel place in a court.

   The very aspect of the Chapel gave him hope--it was so small and so
   hidden away. He entered, and, to his satisfaction, he found in the
   congregation less than a score--here were the faithful few! At any
   rate, he could say of this, "Is it not a little one?" The minister was
   as doleful as could be desired and the subject was full of lamentation.
   He tells me that he sat down there in peace, for he found himself at
   home! I am glad he was suited. Different people have different ways,
   you know, and some love to be comfortably wretched. But I find myself
   miserable only when I keep away from my Lord and His work of
   new-creation. I have always found that when I can get under the shadow
   of His wings, my soul is at rest and I look upon that restfulness and
   happiness as the work and fruit of the Spirit--"the fruit of the Spirit
   is joy and peace."

   My impression is that I am not right when I give way to depression and
   melancholy. I certainly should not go to a place of worship seeking for
   doubt and despondency! Neither should I conclude that I must be on the
   way to Heaven because I felt in my own heart some of the miseries of
   Hell. When I am despondent, I say to myself, "Why are you cast down, O
   my Soul?" I probably know as much about depression of spirit as any man
   that lives, but I consider myself foolish and blameworthy--a fool for
   knowing so much darkness--and I do not want to feel any more of it. I
   would like to drive myself out of it once and for all if I could, for
   we ought to be glad and rejoice forever in that which God creates! He
   has created His people as a rejoicing--yes, His people to be a joy!
   Ours is a heritage of joy and peace! My dear Brothers and Sisters, if
   anybody in the world ought to be happy, we are the people! How large
   our obligations! How boundless our privileges! How brilliant our
   hopes!--

   "Bright the prospect soon that greets us

   Of that longed-for nuptial day

   When our heavenly Bridegroom meets us

   On His kingly, conquering way!

   In Glory, bride and Bridegroom reign forever."

   What should make us miserable? Shall the children of the bride chamber
   mourn while the Bridegroom is with them? Sin?--that is forgiven!
   Affliction?--that is working our good! Inward corruptions?--they are
   doomed to die! Satanic temptations?--we wear an armor which they cannot
   penetrate! We have every reason for delight and we have, moreover, this
   command for it, "Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He will give
   you the desires of your heart." God bring us into that blessed
   condition and keep us there!

   God intended not only that we should have joy, but that we should
   spread it among others. He intends that wherever we go, we should be
   light-bearers and set other lamps shining. Why are some so afraid of
   joy? They seem, wherever they go, to be busy in turning out the lambs.
   The first thing to be done is, "Take that child out." Dear little
   child, with its pleasant prattle, so happy at your feet!--why send it
   away? If there is a very happy hymn in the book, do not sing it--it
   would be presumptuous! Sing--

   "Lord, what a wretched land is this."

   Crooked meter, key dismal, dolorous tune! I fear that certain
   Christians go through this world making it miserable as they march
   through it. Oh, that they could see that Christ has come to destroy the
   works of the devil and would have us rejoice in the new creation of our
   God!

   Alas, there are heady, hard-hearted persons abroad who, by their
   willfulness and pride, would crush every flower in the garden beneath
   their wicked hoofs! Wherever they go, everything is despised, ridiculed
   and kicked by them! This is the spirit of the Evil One! Oh, do not so!
   Christian people, you dare not be so! You shall not be so--God will not
   let you

   be so--you must be gentle, compassionate, generous, kind, gracious!
   Wherever you go, try to make others happy, for God creates Jerusalem as
   a rejoicing and His people a joy--a joy to others who have no joy, a
   source of happiness to the saddest of our race! Help the widow, comfort
   the fatherless, succor the poor, cheer the desponding, tell the glad
   news to the weary heart. In the Father's hands, in Christ's hands, in
   the Spirit's hands, seek to break the prisoner's fetters and to bring
   him out into the light of liberty! You, too, are anointed to proclaim
   liberty to the captives. May the God of infinite mercy help you and
   help me to do so!

   Now, dear Friends, just for a minute upon this creation. I want to show
   how the work of God does create a joy-making people. As soon as ever we
   are converted, what is one of the first things that comes of it? Why,
   joy! The morning I found Christ, it snowed very hard. The snowflakes
   fluttered around me like white doves, as I went home, and I felt just
   as light as those, for my soul was washed whiter than snow! It was not
   a gloomy winter's day to me, but all Nature wore her bridal dress in
   sympathy with my delight! Was it not so with you on the day of your new
   birth? Were you not as happy as you could be when you first found the
   Savior? So far, you see, the Lord creates joy--and it is better, still,
   further on! When the creation of God goes on and a man is helped to
   conquer sin--when the work of Grace in his soul grows and increases, he
   cries, "Thanks be to God which gives us the victory"--and he gets
   increased joy in his soul over every conquered sin.

   When you and I see sin subdued, do we not feel happy? Whenever the news
   comes to me that a man has been reclaimed from drunkenness, or a woman
   is saved from the streets, or when I hear of a hard-hearted sinner
   repenting, I rejoice in the Lord! Conversion days are our high
   holidays! Revivals are our jubilees! Thus the Lord gives us
   opportunities for joy and rejoicing as His new-creation work proceeds
   stage by stage. Better days are in store, it may be, and I trust that
   in years to come we shall more and more behold God working and shall
   rejoice therein!

   But, by-and-by, there will be a still greater joy! We shall enter into
   Heaven and there will be joy among the angels and joy in our heart over
   God's new-creation work which will proceed at a glorious rate! Then the
   nations will be converted to God. I know not when, nor exactly how, but
   the day shall come when Christ shall reign from pole to pole. And what
   a joy that will be! We shall, indeed, be glad in that which God
   creates, as the islands of the sea shall ring out His praise! Then
   Christ the Lord will come and what joy and rejoicing there will be in
   that day when He has fully fashioned the new earth and the new heavens!
   His ancient people, the seed of Abraham, shall be gathered in with
   exultation. We will clap our hands when the long-wandering nation shall
   turn unto the true God and acknowledge the rejected Messiah of the
   house of David!

   The Gentiles will not be jealous. They will rejoice as the Jew comes in
   and then will the Jews rejoice over the Gentiles, as they see them
   worshipping Abraham's God! Everything that is to come in the eternal
   future flashes the Light of God into the eyes of Believers and calls
   upon them to rejoice in anticipation! Nothing prophesied should be
   dreaded by us. There is nothing foretold by Seer, or beheld in vision,
   that can alarm the Christian. He can stand serenely on the brink of the
   great eternity and say, "Come on! Let every event foretold become a
   fact! Pour out your vials, you angels! Fall, you star called Wormwood!
   Come, Gog and Magog, to the last great battle of Armageddon!" Nothing
   is to be dreaded! Nothing is to be feared by those who are one with
   Jesus! To us remains nothing but joy and rejoicing, for God has made
   His people a rejoicing--yes, His people a joy!

   V. I finish up with the last point, IT IS A JOY IN WHICH WE SHARE WITH
   GOD. Gently, my tongue! Timidly

   and cautiously speak here! Here is your warrant for supposing a
   fellowship with God and man in this joy--"Behold, I create Jerusalem a
   rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and
   joy in My people." The wonderful comes out here! God, Himself, the
   Ever-Blessed, finds joy in His new creation! Here is ground for
   marveling! I have often said to you that when the Lord made the
   material world, there was not much in it to touch His spiritual Nature
   and so He simply spoke and said, in plain prose, "It is good." That was
   all--He said it was good. But when the Lord has made new heavens and
   earth, when He has finished, when the bride of Christ shall be brought
   to Him--you know the word, "He will rest in His love, He will joy over
   her with singing."

   Did you ever get into your hearts the idea of the Lord God singing? God
   singing over His Church, over His Jerusalem, over His new creation! God
   singing! I can understand the angels singing for joy over God's work,
   but here is God singing over His own work! I will tell you something
   more wonderful than that--it is that you should be a part of that work
   and that God should sing over you! And yet it is not so very wonderful,
   for is He not the Father, and does not the

   Father sing over His prodigal son that wandered and is come back? Is He
   not the Savior, and will not the Savior, who bought us with His blood,
   sing over us who are the purchase of His agonies? He is the Spirit, and
   shall not the Spirit, who has strived with us and worked all our works
   in us, sing when His work is done and we are sanctified?

   Father, when Your eternal purposes are all fulfilled, You will joy over
   Your people! Son of God, Redeemer, when all Your agonies shall have
   received their recompense in the salvation of Your redeemed, You will
   rejoice over Your chosen! Holy Spirit, when all Your condescending
   indwelling within us shall have accomplished its design, You will
   rejoice in Your people! Come now, Beloved, rejoice in sympathy with the
   Divine heart! When the father found his son, he made the whole
   household merry, and shall not we be? When the woman had found her
   piece of money, she called together her friends and neighbors and she
   said, "Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."
   Shall not we rejoice with the Spirit over the lost silver pieces? When
   the shepherd brought home his sheep, he said, "Rejoice with me; for I
   have found my sheep which was lost." Come, then, rejoice with the
   Father, rejoice with the Son, rejoice with the Spirit! And if the Lord
   God, as the Trinity in Unity, invites us to be glad and rejoice in that
   which He creates, let us not hold back, but let us sing His matchless
   love and new-creating power and infinite wisdom! I am sure you will
   sing! You must sing even now, if you know yourselves to be a part of
   this amazing Grace!

   And now I close with this observation. Nobody will ever rejoice in this
   new-creating work of God while he is rejoicing in his own works and
   trusting in himself and boasting his own merits. It is a sign of Grace
   when a man is sick of self and is in harmony with God. When he leaves
   off rejoicing in what he can do and comes to rejoice in what God has
   done and is doing, then a change has been worked in him! Some of you
   are trying to save yourselves and make yourselves right before God--as
   well might the dead try to find life for themselves. It cannot be done!
   You must be made new by a power you have not within yourself--by a
   Divine Power. You must be born again and this is the work of God--not
   your work. We shall know when this heavenly work is begun in you when
   you cease from rejoicing in anything that you are or can be of
   yourselves, and then shall you, with us, rejoice in that which God
   creates in you!

   Ring the bells of Heaven! Tune your voices, sons of earth! He who makes
   all things new is on the Throne, working out His holy pleasure.
   Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.

The Private Thoughts and Words of Jesus

   (No. 2212)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 12, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   26, 1891

   "And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in
   the way, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son
   of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes,
   and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the
   Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him: and the third day
   He shall rise again." Matthew 20:17-19.

   You have this same story in Matthew, Mark and Luke, a little
   differently told, as would naturally be the case when the information
   came from three different observers. It will be to our edification to
   put the three accounts together, so as to get a complete view of the
   incident, for each Evangelist mentions something omitted by the others.

   Our Lord firmly resolved to go to Jerusalem about a fortnight before
   the Passover, with the view of becoming, Himself, the Lamb of God's
   Passover. He had frequently left Jerusalem when His life had been in
   danger because His time was not yet come and He, thus, set us the
   example of not willfully running into danger, or braving it with
   foolhardiness. But now that He felt that the hour of His s

   Sacrifice was near at hand, He did not hesitate, or seek to avoid it,
   but He resolutely set out to meet His sufferings and His death. When He
   was in the highway that led to Jerusalem, He marched in front of the
   little band of His disciples with so vigorous and bold a step--and with
   such a calm, determined air of heroism upon Him, that His followers
   were filled with astonishment (Mark 10:52).

   Here are the very words--"And they were in the way going up to
   Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them; and they were amazed, and as
   they followed they were afraid." Knowing that, according to His own
   account, He was going to suffering and death and, being well assured,
   from their own observation, that He was about to encounter the most
   furious opposition, they were amazed at His dauntless courage and
   wondered what made Him so resolved! We also read that "they were
   afraid," afraid for themselves, in a measure, but most of all afraid
   for Him. Would not His daring lead to conflict with the powers then in
   authority and might not terrible things happen both to Him and to them?
   It was not altogether timidity, but awe which came over them--His
   manner was so majestic and sublime. That lowly Man had a something
   about Him which commanded the trembling reverence of His disciples.
   After all, meekness is imperial--and commands far more reverence than
   anger or pride.

   His followers felt that great events were about to transpire and they
   were deeply sobered and filled with awe-struck apprehension. In the
   Presence of their Lord, who seemed to be leading a forlorn hope to a
   fierce battle, they were afraid. They were amazed at His courage and
   afraid for the consequences. They were also amazed at Him and afraid
   because of their own unfitness to stand in His Presence. Do we not know
   what this feeling is? Then it was that He took the 12 aside and began
   to tell them what things should happen to Him. The conversation was
   private. At this time we will go aside with the chosen Apostles for a
   little while and hear what their Lord would say to us, even as He
   aforetime said it to them. May the good Spirit bless our meditation!

   I shall have three things to speak of and the first will be our Lord's
   private communings. This will give us an insight, secondly, into our
   Lord's private thoughts. And when we have looked into these a little,
   as far as our dim eyes are able, we will then notice, in the third
   place, our Lord's dwelling on the details of His passion, for into
   those details He went with singular impressiveness. Let us not forget
   our need of the Holy Spirit's illumination while we come near to a
   place so holy as this of "The Revelation of the Passion."

   I. First, then, our LORD'S PRIVATE COMMUNINGS. He did not say all
   things to all men. He spoke certain matters only to His disciples. To
   the outside world it was given to hear the parable, but to the
   disciples was it given to know the explanation. Not even to all the
   disciples did our Lord make known the whole of His teachings. He had an
   elect out of the elect! First came 12 out of the many and then came
   three out of the twelve. These three were admitted to special
   manifestations which the other nine did not share. As if to carry the
   principle of election to the utmost extent, one was chosen out of the
   three, who enjoyed a peculiar personal love and leaned his head upon
   his Lord's bosom, as the other two never did. We are happy to be
   admitted, by the key of Inspiration, into the inner chamber of our
   Lord's private conferences.

   On this occasion, our Lord's communings were with the leaders of His
   band. Those who have to lead others need more instruction than the
   rest. It needs more Grace to lead than to follow. No man can give out
   what he has not received. If you are to be a fountain of living waters
   to others, you must, yourself, be filled from the fullness of God. Dear
   Brothers and Sisters, you whom the Lord has chosen to be vessels of
   mercy to others, take care that you wait much upon Him yourselves, and
   are much with Him in secret retirement. Live near to God, that you may
   bring others near. I remember sitting, one rainy day, in an inn, at
   Cologne, looking out of a window upon a square. There was not much to
   see, but what was to see I did see, as I occasionally looked up from my
   writing.

   I saw a man coming to a pump that stood in the middle of the square and
   from that pump he filled a vessel. A little while after, I saw the same
   man again filling his buckets. All that morning I saw no one else, but
   only that one water-loving individual, filling his buckets again and
   again. I thought to myself, "What can he be? Why is he always drawing
   water?" Then I perceived that he was a water carrier, a bearer of water
   to families in the adjoining streets. Well might he often come to the
   fountain, himself, since he was supplying others. You that are water
   carriers for thirsty souls must necessarily come often to the Living
   Water, yourselves, and be thankful that your Master is always willing
   to meet you and give you rich supplies! He graciously waits to take you
   apart in the way and speak to you things which you need to hear and
   tell. Take care that you hear well that which you are commissioned to
   publish to all the world. Take good note of this, you who instruct
   others--neglect not the yielding of your ears to your Lord quite as
   completely as your tongue. Hear Him that you may speak of Him. Be sure
   that you are alone much with your Lord, that you may have Him much with
   you in public.

   When our Lord, on this occasion, spoke to the 12, the time was
   significant--it was on the way to a great trial. To Him, His coming
   suffering was the sum of all trial. He was about to be wounded for our
   transgressions and bruised for our iniquities! The chastisement of our
   peace was about to fall upon Him that with His stripes we might be
   healed. But it was also to be a time of great trial to the disciples.
   Inasmuch as they loved their Lord, they would sympathize with His
   sufferings and death. Inasmuch as they trusted in Him, it would be a
   sharp trial to their faith to see Him dying on the Cross, vanquished by
   His remorseless enemies. Inasmuch as they loved His company, they would
   weep and lament, and feel like orphaned children when He was taken from
   them. Therefore they must be favored with a special private interview
   to prepare them for the coming ordeal.

   Have you ever noticed how our Lord, before the coming to us of a great
   tribulation, strengthens our hearts by some heavenly visitation? Either
   before or after the affliction, it has happened to me to enjoy very
   special manifestations of the Well-Beloved. At such junctures He brings
   us into His banqueting house and His banner over us is love, that we
   may go down to the battle like men refreshed by a feast. He gives us a
   joyful bracing up, that we may be ready for tomorrow's stern service. I
   feel that it is so and I pray that each of you may know, by personal
   experience, how wise is your Redeemer's foresight--and how, by the
   communion apart, He prepares us for that which we are to meet at the
   end of the way. A drink from the brook of fellowship by the way will
   make you ready for the heat of the conflict. A word from His
   myrrh-dropping lips will perfume the air, even of the valley of
   death-shade. Speak to us, Lord, and we will not heed the howls of the
   dog of Hell!

   When our Master thus took the 12 apart, we may say of His conversation,
   that it was upon choice themes. Our Lord's conversation is always holy
   and suitable for the occasion. He spoke to them of the Scriptures. Luke
   says, "He took unto Him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go
   up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the Prophets
   concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished." Blessed theme--the
   Word of the Lord by His Prophets and the fulfillment thereof! Have you
   ever noticed how our Divine Lord delights to speak upon the Scriptures?
   How often does He en-

   force His teaching by, "as the Scripture has said"! If He has only two
   of them and they are walking on the road, we read, "Beginning at Moses
   and all the Prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the
   things concerning Himself." Communion with Christ Jesus must be based
   on the Word of the Lord!

   If you speak half a word derogatory of Holy Scripture, your fellowship
   will evaporate. Men talk about building upon Christ and not upon the
   Scriptures, but they know not what they say, for our Lord continually
   established His own claims by appealing to Moses and the Prophets! They
   would be Christo-centric, they say--I only wish they would! But if they
   take Christ for a center, they will inevitably have the Scriptures for
   a center, too--and these men neither want the one nor the other. They
   care nothing for the center--they only want to do away with the
   circumference, that they may roam at their own proud wills! Our Lord
   made the written Word to be the reason for many of His acts--He did
   this and He did not do that--because of what the Scriptures had said.
   He comes not to take away the Law and the Prophets, yes, not a jot or a
   tittle does He destroy, so careful is He of the Scriptures of truth! We
   learn from Him to believe not only in Inspired Words, but in Inspired
   jots and tittles!

   They that have been much with Christ always show a profound reverence
   for the Word of God. I have never yet met with a person worthy to be
   called a saint who did not love and revere the Inspired Book. I have
   heard, in the last few days, the newly-coined word, "bibliolatry,"
   which is meant to set forth the imaginary crime of worshipping the
   Bible. I know not who may be guilty of the offense--I have never met
   with such idolaters. When I do, I will try to show them their error,
   but at present I am too much occupied with the enemies of the Bible to
   think much of its too ardent friends, if there is such an one! While
   the word may be used in an accusation against us, it most surely is a
   confession on the part of those who use it that they see nothing
   special about the Scriptures and are angry with those who do! Let them
   speak as they will, O Lord, "my heart stands in awe of Your Word." I
   would be numbered with the men who tremble at Your

   Word!

   The words of the Holy Spirit are more than words to me. I tremble lest
   I should sin against Him by sinning against them! I would not take away
   a word from the Book of this prophecy, nor add thereunto--let it stand
   as it is--for here it is that Jesus meets us and communes with us! He
   opens the Scriptures to our understanding and then He opens our
   understanding to receive the Scriptures. He makes us hear His voice in
   these chapters--yes, we see Him in them--

   "Here I behold my Sa vior's face Almost in every page."

   We cannot look up to Heaven and see Jesus amid the celestial splendors,
   but He lovingly looks down from the Throne of His Glory into the mirror
   of the Word--and when we look into it we see the sweet reflection of
   His face. As in a mirror, His countenance is displayed by Scripture. O
   Believers, love the Word of God! Prize every letter of it and be
   prepared to answer the cold, carping words of critics who know nothing
   of the benediction which comes to us through every line of Inspiration.
   These are they who would cruelly divide the living child, for it does
   not belong to them, but we will have no sword come near it, for it is
   our love--it is life and bliss to us! Our Lord, in His most private
   conversation with our souls, speaks in, and by, and through the
   Scriptures in the power of the Holy Spirit!

   But the chief theme that our Lord dwelt upon was His own suffering even
   unto death. Beloved, our Lord Jesus has said many delightful
   things--and let Him say what He will, His voice is as angels' music to
   our ears! But from the Cross, His voice is richest in consolation. We
   never come so near to Jesus--at least, such is my experience--as when
   we gaze upon His bloody sweat, or see Him robed in shame, crowned with
   thorns and enthroned upon the Cross! Our Lord's incomparable beauties
   are most visible amid His griefs. When I see Him on the Cross, I feel
   that I must borrow Pilate's words and cry, "Behold the Man!" Covered
   with His own blood from the scourging and about to be led away to be
   crucified between two thieves, you look into His inmost heart and
   behold what manner of love He bore towards guilty men!

   We know not Christ till He puts on His crimson garments. I know not my
   Beloved when He is only to me as the snow-white lily for purity. But
   when, in His wounding, He is red as the rose, then I perceive Him! "My
   Beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand." A suffering
   Savior bears the palm for me--a wounded Savior is my Lord and my God!
   The lower He went for my redemption, the higher does He rise in my
   soul's loving esteem. He saw this when He said, "I, if I am lifted up,"
   for, indeed, it was a lifting up of Him to die upon the cruel Cross. To
   the wondering universe, the Son of God is lifted to a height of
   wondering admiration by His becoming obedient unto death out of love to
   His

   chosen. He is lifted up in every grateful heart and shall be lifted up
   forever. Our fellowship with Jesus largely flows along the great deep
   of His suffering and to me, at least, it is then deepest, truest and
   sweetest.

   Our Lord talked to the 12 of His sufferings in great detail, of which
   we will speak further on, but He did not shrink from dwelling upon His
   death, nor did He stop there, but foretold His rising again. In each of
   the three accounts He appears to end the story of His passion by saying
   that on the third day He would rise again from the dead. That was a
   glorious climax--"The third day He shall rise again." Oh, that blessed
   doctrine of the Resurrection! If our Lord's record ended at the Cross,
   it might drive us to despair. But He is declared to be the Son of God
   with power by His Resurrection from the dead! That He was raised from
   the dead makes us see the merit, the power, the great reward of His
   death. He that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great
   Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the Everlasting Covenant, even
   He will make us perfect in every good work to do His will. Whenever the
   Master comes very near to us in His gracious condescension, He shows us
   not only that He shed His blood for us, but that He rose again and
   always lives to carry on our cause. When you worship most closely, you
   will worship Him that lived, died, rose again and now lives forever and
   ever. This is our Lord Jesus Christ! He is not only a teacher, or
   merely a bright example, but One whose death is the source of our
   salvation and whose Resurrection and eternal Glory are the guarantee
   and foretaste of our everlasting bliss! A living, dying, risen Christ
   is One with whom we have joyful fellowship! And if we know Him not in
   this Character, we do not know Him at all!

   Furthermore, He conversed with them upon their share in all this. They
   were one with Him in that which would befall Him. He says, "Behold, we
   go up to Jerusalem." True, they would have no share in the scourging,
   the spitting and the Crucifixion. He must tread that winepress alone.
   But yet they would, with Him, carry the cross in the near future, and
   with Him deny themselves during the rest of their lives. Henceforward
   it would not only be Jesus the Lord who would bear witness for God and
   righteousness, but the followers of the Crucified One would unite in
   testimony to the same Truth of God, for the same great purpose! It was
   well for Him to speak to them on such a practical theme--they would be
   cheered and comforted in later days when they remembered that He had
   told them of these things. He will draw us into very intimate communion
   if we are willing to take up His Cross and bear His reproach. We lose
   much when we quit the separated path because it is rough, for we lose
   our Lord's sweet company. Oh, for Grace to love the rough paths because
   we see His footprints on them!

   They listened to this private talk, but we are told by Luke that it was
   very much lost upon them because they did not understand Him. "And they
   understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them,
   neither knew they the things which were spoken." "But," you say, "it
   was very simple." Possibly that is why they did not understand it.
   Numbers of people imagine that they understand mysteries and yet the
   simplicities of the faith are hid from their eyes because they are
   gazing after abstruse doctrines. They search after difficult things and
   miss the plain Truth of God! We groan as we wantonly dive into a
   profound abyss and yet we stand confounded over a little transparent
   stream, which, to wade through, would bring us bliss!

   When our Lord told the 12 that He would die, they imagined that it was
   a parable, concealing some deep mystery. They looked at one another and
   they tried to fathom where there was no depth, but where the Truth lay
   on the surface. The deep things of God, thousands will pry into, but
   yet these are not saving matters--nor are they of any great practical
   value. Fixed fate, free will, predestination, prophecy and the
   like--these have small bearings upon our salvation from sin--but in the
   death of our Lord lies the kernel of the matter! Beloved, when we try
   to commune with Jesus, let us wear the garments of simplicity! It is
   the serpent who trades in subtlety, but I would have you remember "the
   simplicity which is in Christ Jesus." There is in Him a depth which we
   cannot fathom, but His every Word is the pure Truth of God and those
   things which are necessary are made so plain that he who runs may read
   and he who reads may run!

   Believe Him to mean what He says and take His promises as they stand
   and His precepts in their plain meaning! And, oh, if we do this, we
   shall be made greatly wise! Do not confuse your minds with doctrinal
   riddles nor amuse your souls with spiritual mysteries, but believe in
   Him who is Jesus, the faithful and true, who makes known to us the
   heart of the Father! Believe that He died in our place! Believe that He
   took our sin upon Him and carried it all away! Believe that we are
   justified through His Resurrection and are made to live because He
   lives! Hypotheses and critical doubts we may leave to the dogs that
   first sniffed them out, but as for us, we will be as children who eat
   the bread their father gives them and

   ask no questions as to the field in which the wheat was reaped--and
   raise no debates as to the mill at which the seed was ground!

   Thus, you see, the private conversations of our Lord with the 12 dealt
   with His sufferings and death--and His communications come home to our
   hearts in proportion as we are prepared to receive them in childlike
   simplicity.

   II. Secondly, we will now turn our minds to THE PRIVATE THOUGHTS OF OUR
   LORD JESUS. We shall not be

   presumptuous if we humbly enquire--What were the thoughts of our Lord
   at the time? When He had called them quite apart and spoken to them, we
   may be quite sure that what He said to them was the outcome of His
   innermost meditations.

   Our Lord was forecasting His death in all its mournful details. Do you
   not know that frequently it is more painful to anticipate death than it
   is actually to die? Yet our Lord dwelt upon His sufferings, even to
   their minutiae. A person was speaking to me, the other day, of a
   painful operation which he was bound to undergo. There was no
   probability that he could get into the hospital for another month or
   two and he remarked that he greatly wished that the operation could
   have been performed sooner, "For," he said, "it is so painful to be
   looking forward to a matter so distressing. Let it be soon," was his
   cry. Our Lord was like a grain of wheat which is cast into the ground
   and lies there, for a while, before it dies. He was buried, as it were,
   in prospective agony--immersed in suffering which He foresaw. In the
   thought of the Cross, He endured it before He felt the nails! The
   shadow of His death was upon Him before He reached the tree of doom!
   Yet He did not put away the thought, but dwelt upon it as one who
   tastes a cup before he drinks it to the dregs. After so deliberate a
   testing, is it not all the more marvelous that He did not refuse the
   draught?

   Did He not remember His engagement to go through with our redemption?
   "Lo, I come," He said, "in the volume of the Book it is written of Me."
   He had pledged Himself by solemn Covenant and in the Book it was
   written that He would stand in our place and give His life an offering
   for sin. From this suretyship He never departed. He knew that the
   Father would bruise Him and put Him to grief in the approaching day of
   His anger. He knew that the wicked would pierce His hands and His feet.
   He knew all that would occur and He stayed not back from the pledge
   which He had given in the council chamber of eternity, that His life
   should be rendered up as a ransom for many! It were well if we, also,
   remembered our vows to God and the obligations under which we are
   placed by His great love.

   Our Lord's thoughts took the form of a resolution to do the Father's
   will to the end. He set His face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
   Nothing could make Him look aside. He had undertaken and He would go
   through with it. Unless it should prove possible for us to be saved
   otherwise, He would not set aside that cup which His Father had given
   Him to drink. The thought of our perishing, He could not bear--that was
   not to be tolerated. He would suffer all imaginable and unimaginable
   woe sooner than desert the cause He had espoused. He was straitened--so
   He described it--straitened till His labor was accomplished! He was
   like a Man pent up against His will--He longed to be discharging His
   tremendous task. He had an awful work to do, an agonizing suffering to
   bear, and He felt fettered until He could be at it--"How am I
   straitened till it is accomplished!" He was as a hostage bound for
   others, longing to be set free! He longed to be bearing the penalty to
   which He had voluntarily subjected Himself by His Covenant Suretyship.
   He therefore thought upon that "obedience unto death" which He was
   determined and resolved to render.

   He had an eye, all the while, to you and to me. While He was thinking
   of death, He was chiefly regarding those for whom He would suffer. I
   doubt not that there flashed before that mighty mind the individuals
   who make up the vast host of His redeemed--and among them there were
   insignificant individuals such as we are. Out of His strong love to us,
   even to us, He determined to pay our ransom price in death--it was part
   of His solace that He would deliver you and me. "He loved me and gave
   Himself for me." He made a voluntary offering of Himself for me, before
   He actually died--often and often surrendering Himself in purpose
   before the Cross was reared for the actual offering up of His body once
   and for all.

   Then there came into His mind, also, the thought of the grand sequel of
   it all. He would rise again! On the third day it would all be over and
   the recompense would begin. A few hours of bitter grief. A night of
   bloody sweat. A night and a morning of mockery when He would be flouted
   by the abjects and made nothing of by the profane. A direful afternoon
   of deadly anguish on the Cross and of dark desertion by Jehovah! And
   then the bowing of the head and a little rest in the grave for His
   body. And on the third day the light would break upon mankind, for the
   Sun of Righteousness would arise with healing in His wings! The light
   that would come when He should rise would lighten the Gentiles and be
   the Glory of His people Israel. He would then have said, "It is
   finished," and He would shortly afterward ascend to reap His reward in

   personal glorification and in receiving gifts for men--yes, for the
   rebellious, also, that the Lord God might dwell among them!

   Surely our Lord's thoughts were all the while upon His Father! He
   always remembered the Beloved Father to whom He was to be "obedient
   unto death, even the death of the Cross." That 22nd Psalm, which might
   well be our Lord's on the Cross, is full of God--it is an appeal to
   God. As our Lord went on His way with the 12, conversing upon the road,
   they must have seen that He was in close communion with God. There was
   about Him a deep solemnity of spirit--a rapt communion with the
   Unseen--a heavenly walking with God even beyond His usual. This, mixed
   with His deeply-fixed re-solve--and that stern joy which only they can
   feel who are resolved to accomplish a great purpose through bowing to
   the Divine will, let it cost what it may. The God and Father of our
   Lord Jesus was everything to Him! And in all His acts, His heart was
   set upon Jehovah's Glory.

   I wish that I had time for my subject, but it is overwhelming me. I can
   only open the door and bid you look into the private thoughts of Him
   whose thoughts are priceless gems, whereas yours and mine are as the
   pebbles of the brook. What meditations were His! How precious, also,
   are Your thoughts unto me, O Christ! How great is the sum of them!
   Wonderful things did You ponder in Your soul on those days of Your
   nearing passion!

   III. Now we will have a few moments as to OUR LORD'S DWELLING ON
   DETAILS. I do not want to preach. I wish to be a kind of guide for your
   thoughts, just setting the example by thinking first that you may
   follow. May the sacred Spirit now lead you quietly into the points upon
   which our Lord so calmly enlarged!

   Note well what our Lord said about His sufferings. "Behold, we go up to
   Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed." Stop there!
   "Betrayed"! It is as though I heard the deep boom of a death knell.
   "Betrayed"! "Betrayed"! To die, yes, that is not a word with a sting in
   it to Him! But, "Betrayed"!--that means sold by cruel treachery! It
   means that one who ate bread with Him lifted up his heel against Him!
   It means that a man who was His familiar acquaintance, with whom He
   walked to the House of God in company, sold Him for a paltry bribe.
   "Betrayed for thirty pieces of silver! A goodly price, indeed, for the
   blood of such a Friend! "Betrayed"! Hear how He cries--"If it were an
   enemy, then I could have borne it." "Betrayed"! It was no stranger--it
   was no bloodhound of the Pharisees who scented Him out in the
   garden--but, "Judas also, which betrayed Him, knew the place." Betrayed
   with a kiss and with a friendly word! Handed over to them who sought
   His blood by one who ought to have defended Him to the death!
   "Betrayed"! It is a dreadful word to be set here before the passion,
   and it throws a lurid light over it all. We read--"The same night in
   which He was betrayed He took bread." This was the bitterest drop in
   His cup--that He was betrayed.

   And still is He betrayed! If the Gospel dies in England, write on its
   tomb, "Betrayed." If our churches lose their holy influence among men,
   write on them, "Betrayed." What care we for infidels? What care we for
   those who curse and blaspheme? They cannot hurt the Christ! His wounds
   are those which He receives in the house of His friends. "Betrayed"! O
   Savior, some of us have been betrayed, but ours was a small sorrow
   compared with Yours, for You were betrayed into the hands of sinners by
   one who claimed to be Your friend, by one who was bound by every tie to
   have been Your faithful follower. "Betrayed"! Beloved, I cannot bear
   the word! It falls like a flake of fire into my bosom and burns its way
   into my inmost soul. "Betrayed"! And such a faithful Friend as He! So
   full of love and yet betrayed!

   Read on. "The Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests, and
   unto the scribes."" The chief priests ought to have always been His
   best defenders! They were the leaders of the religion of the day--these
   chief priests were the guides of Israel! When Israel bowed before the
   Lord, the chief priests presented the sacrifice. Yet these were our
   Lord's most bitter enemies--by their malice He was condemned and
   crucified! It is hard to have the professed servants of God against
   you. The scribes, too, those Bible writers and Bible
   interpreters--these, also, were fiercely against Him. From the hands of
   scribes He would have less mercy than from soldiers. I said, the other
   Lord's-Day, what I now repeat--I would rather be bitten by wolves than
   by sheep! It is wretched work to have those against you who are
   reckoned to be the best men of the time. It was little to Him to have
   Herod against Him, or Pilate and the Romans as His foes, for they knew
   no better. But it was heart-rending work to see the men of the
   Sanhedrim, the men of prayers and phylacteries, the men of the Temple
   and of the synagogue arrayed against Him! Yet into their hands He
   falls! Good Master, You are delivered into the hands of men who know no
   mercy, for they hate You for Your faithful words! They can compromise,
   but You cannot! They can trifle with language, but You cannot! They can
   play the hypocrite and that, You cannot do!

   Read on--"And they shall condemn Him to death." They did not leave the
   sentence of condemnation to the Romans, but they, themselves, passed
   sentence upon their Victim. The priests, whose office made them types
   of Himself--and the scribes, who were the official interpreters of His
   Father's Book--these condemned the Holy and Just One! They count Him
   worthy of death--nothing less will serve their turn. This the Christ
   could plainly see and it was no small trial to come under the censure
   of His country's governors. They could not put Him to death,
   themselves. If they dared, they would have stoned Him and that would
   have broken the prophecy which declared that in death His enemies must
   pierce His hands and His feet. They can condemn Him to death, but they
   cannot execute the sentence! Yet none the less, this iron entered into
   His soul that those who were professedly the servants of God condemned
   Him to die! If you have ever tasted of this cup you know that it has
   wormwood in it.

   Notice, further--"And shall deliver Him to the Gentiles." All men
   conspired in our Master's death--not half the world, but all of it must
   have a hand in the tragedy of Calvary. The Gentile must come in. He
   takes his share in this iniquity, for Pilate condemns Him to the Cross.
   The chief priests hand Him over to Pilate and he commits Him to the
   Roman soldiers that they may do the cruel deed. They "delivered Him to
   the Gentiles." The Master dwells on this. It opens another gate through
   which His sorrows poured. At the hands of the Gentiles He dies--and for
   Gentiles He suffered. Beloved, I like to see how the Master notes this
   point. He makes distinctions. He does not say that He should be
   condemned by Pilate, but He is condemned to die by the chief priests
   and then He is delivered to the Gentiles. He sees it all and dwells
   upon the points of special interest. O Believer, behold your Lord bound
   and taken away to the Hall of Pilate! See Him delivered to the
   Gentiles, while His fellow countrymen cry, "We have no king but
   Caesar"! They shout, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" And the Gentiles carry
   out their cruel demand. Unanimity among our persecutors must add
   greatly to the sting of their unkindness.

   These three words follow--"To mock, and to scourge, and to crucify
   Him." Mark puts in, "To spit upon Him." That was a sad part of the
   mockery. What dreadful scorning He endured! From the Jews, when they
   blindfolded Him and buffeted Him--and from the Gentiles when they put
   on Him a purple robe and thrust a reed into His hand, bowed the knee
   and cried before Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" They plucked His hair.
   They smote His cheeks. They spat in His face. Mockery could go no
   farther. It was cruel, cutting, cursed scorn! Ridicule sometimes breaks
   hearts that are hardened against pain--and the Christ had to bear all
   the ridicule that human minds could invent. They were maliciously
   witty. They jested at His Person. They jested at His prayers. They
   mocked Him when He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
   Herein is immeasurable grief and the Savior foresaw it and spoke about
   it.

   That was not all--they scourged Him. I will not harrow your hearts by
   trying to describe scourging as it existed among the Romans. The
   scourge was an infamous instrument of torture. It is said to have been
   made of the sinews of oxen, intertwisted with the hucklebones of sheep
   and slivers of bone--so that every time the lashes fell, they plowed
   the back and laid bare the white bones of the shoulders. It was an
   anguish more cruel than the grave! But our Lord endured it to the
   fullest. They mocked Him and they scourged Him--He dwells upon each
   separate item. Some of our most touching hymns upon our Lord's passion
   are spoken of by the cold-blooded critics of today as sensuous. "I
   cannot bear," says one, "to hear so much about the physical agonies of
   Christ." Beloved, we must preach the physical agonies of Christ more
   than ever because this is an age of affectation in which His mental and
   spiritual griefs are no more apprehended than those of His body!

   The device is to be rid of His sufferings altogether! This age is as
   fond of physical pleasure as any that has gone before it and it must be
   made to know that physical pain was a great ingredient in the cup which
   our Lord drank for man's redemption! Very many are so unspiritual that
   they will never be reached by high-soaring language, appealing to a
   delicacy which they do not possess. We must exhibit the bleeding Savior
   if we would make men's hearts bleed for sin! The cries of His great
   grief must ring in their ears or they will remain deaf! Let us not be
   ashamed to dwell upon points upon which the Lord, Himself, dwelt.

   Then He adds, "to crucify Him." Here I will come to a pause. Behold
   Him! Behold Him! His hands are extended and cruelly nailed to the wood.
   His feet are fastened to the tree and He is left to bear the weight of
   His body upon His hands and feet. See how the nails tear through the
   flesh as the weight drags the body down and enlarges the wounds! Look,
   He is in a fever! His mouth is dried up and has become like an oven!
   And His tongue cleaves to the roof thereof! Crucifixion was an inhuman
   death and the Savior was "obedient unto death, even the death of the
   Cross." The wonder is that He

   could foresee this and speak of it so calmly. He meditates upon it and
   speaks to choice familiar friends about it! Oh, the mastery of love,
   strong as death! He contemplates the Cross and despises its shame!

   Thus He dwells on it all and then closes by saying, "and the third day
   He shall rise again." We must never forgot that, for He never forgets
   it! Ah, you may think as much as you will of Calvary and let your tears
   flow like rivers. You may sit at Gethsemane and say, "Oh, that my head
   were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and
   night for my Lord!" But, after all, you must wipe those tears away, for
   He is not in the grave--He rose again on the third day! O blessed
   morning! Not to be celebrated by an Easter, once in the year, but to be
   commemorated on every first day of the week, more than 50 times in each
   year! Every seven days that the sun shines upon us brings us a new
   record of His Resurrection! We may sing every Lord's-Day morning--

   "Today He rose and left the dead,

   And Satan's empire fell!

   Today the saints His triumph spread,

   And all His wonders tell."

   The first day of the week stands forever as the remembrance of our
   risen Lord and on that day He renews His special communings with His
   people! We believe in Him! We rise in Him! We triumph in Him! And, "He
   ever lives to make intercession for us." Thus, you see, I have not
   preached my own thoughts, but I have set you thinking. Treasure these
   thoughts in your minds! All this week, sweeten your souls with the
   sacred spices of our Lord's thoughts and Words when near His death. God
   bless this meditation to you by His Holy Spirit!

   If you have never believed in Him, may you believe in Him at once! Why
   delay? He is able to save unto the uttermost! Believe in Him right now!
   And if you have believed, keep on believing and let your believing grow
   more intense. Think more of Jesus, love Him more, serve Him more and
   grow more like He. Peace be unto you for His dear sake! Amen.

"Honey In The Mouth!"

   (No. 2213)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 19, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON, ON FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL 24, 1891,

   AT THE CONFERENCE OF THE PASTORS' COLLEGE EVANGELICAL ASSOCIATION.

   "He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it
   unto you. All things that the Father has are Mine: therefore said I,
   that He shall take of Mine and shall show it unto you." John 16:14,15.

   BELOVED Friends, here you have the Trinity, and there is no salvation
   apart from the Trinity! It must be the Father, the Son and the Holy
   Spirit. "All things that the Father has are Mine," says Christ, and the
   Father has all things. They were always His; they are still His; they
   always will be His--and they cannot become ours till they change
   ownership--till Christ can say, "All things that the Father has are
   Mine"--for it is by virtue of the representative Character of Christ
   standing as the Surety of the Covenant, that the "all things" of the
   Father are passed over to the Son, that they might be passed over to
   us. "It pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell; and
   of His fullness have all we received." But yet we are so dull that
   though the conduit pipe is laid on to the great fountain, we cannot get
   at it. We are lame. We cannot reach it, but in comes the third Person
   of the Divine Unity, even the Holy Spirit, and He receives of the
   things of Christ and then delivers them over to us! So we actually
   receive, through Jesus Christ, by the Spirit, what is in the Father!

   Ralph Erskine, in his preface to a sermon upon the 15th verse, has a
   notable piece. He speaks of Grace as honey-- honey for the cheering of
   the saints, for the sweetening of their mouths and hearts--but he says
   that in the Father, "the honey is in the flower, which is at such a
   distance from us that we could never extract it." In the Son, "the
   honey is in the comb, prepared for us in our Immanuel, God-Man,
   Redeemer, the Word that was made flesh, saying, 'All things that the
   Father has are Mine; and Mine for your use and benefit--it is in the
   comb. But then, next, we have honey in the mouth--the Spirit taking all
   things and making application of them, by showing them unto us and
   making us to eat and drink with Christ, and share of these 'all
   things'--yes, not only eat the honey, but the honeycomb with the
   honey--not only His benefits, but Himself."

   It is a very beautiful division of the subject. Honey in the flower in
   God, as in mystery, really there. There never will be any more honey
   than there is in the flower. There it is. But how shall you and I get
   it? We have not wisdom to extract the sweetness. We are not as the bees
   that are able to find it out. It is bee honey, not man honey. Yet you
   see in Christ it becomes the honey in the honeycomb and, therefore, He
   is sweet to our taste as honey dropping from the comb. Sometimes we are
   so faint that we cannot reach out a hand to grasp that honeycomb and,
   alas, there was a time when our palates were so depraved that we
   preferred bitter things and even thought them sweet! But now that the
   Holy Spirit has come, we have got the honey in the mouth and the taste
   that enjoys it! Yes, we have now so long enjoyed it that the honey of
   Grace has entered into our constitution and we have become sweet unto
   God--His sweetness having been conveyed by this strange method unto us.

   Beloved Friends, I scarcely need say to you, keep the existence of the
   Trinity prominent in your ministry! Remember, you cannot pray without
   the Trinity. If the full work of salvation requires a Trinity, so does
   that very breath by which we live. You cannot draw near to the Father
   except through the Son and by the Holy Spirit. There is undoubtedly a
   trinity in nature. There certainly constantly turns up the need of a
   Trinity in the realm of Grace--and when we get to Heaven we shall
   understand, perhaps, more fully what is meant by the Trinity in Unity.
   But if that is a thing never to be understood, we shall at least
   apprehend it more lovingly, and we shall rejoice more completely as the
   three tones of our music

   shall rise up in perfect harmony unto Him who is One and indivisible,
   and yet is Three, forever blessed, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, one
   God!

   Now for the point which I am to open up to you this morning, though I
   cannot do it, but He must do it. We must sit here and have the text
   acted out upon ourselves. "He shall glorify Me. He shall take of Mine
   and shall show it unto you." May it be so just now!

   First, what the Holy Spirit does--"He shall take of Mine and shall show
   it unto you." Secondly, what the Holy Spirit aims at and really
   effects--"He shall glorify Me." And then, thirdly, how, in doing both
   these things, He is the Comforter. It is the Comforter that does this
   and we shall find our richest, surest comfort in this work of the Holy
   Spirit, who shall take of the things of Christ and show them unto us.

   I. First, WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT DOES. It is clear, Beloved Friends, that
   the Holy Spirit deals with the things of Christ. As our brother,
   Archibald Brown, said, when expounding the chapter just now, He does
   not aim at any originality. He deals with the things of Christ. All
   things that Christ had heard from His Father He made known to us. He
   kept to them. And now the Spirit takes of the things of Christ and of
   nothing else. Do not let us strain at anything new. The Holy Spirit
   could deal with anything in Heaven above, or in the earth beneath--the
   story of the ages past, the story of the ages to come, the inward
   secrets of the earth, the evolution of all things, if there is an
   evolution. He could do it all! Like the Master, He could handle any
   topic He chose, but He confines Himself to the things of Christ and
   therein finds unutterable liberty and boundless freedom.

   Do you think, dear Friend, that you can be wiser than the Holy Spirit?
   And if His choice must be a wise one, will yours be a wise one if you
   begin to take of the things of something or somebody else? You will
   have the Holy Spirit near you when you are receiving of the things of
   Christ, but, as the Holy Spirit is said never to receive anything else,
   when you are handling other things on the Sabbath, you will be handling
   them alone--and the pulpit is a dreary solitude, even in the midst of a
   crowd--if the Holy Spirit is not with you there. You may, if you
   please, think through a theology out of your own vast brain, but the
   Holy Spirit is not with you there. And, mark you, there are some of us
   that are resolved to tarry with the things of Christ and keep on
   dealing with them as far as He enables us to do so! And we feel that we
   are in such blessed company with the Divine Spirit that we do not envy
   you that wider range of thought, if you prefer it.

   The Holy Spirit still exists, works and teaches in the Church. And we
   have a test by which to know whether what people claim to be Revelation
   is Revelation or not--"He shall receive of Mine." The Holy Spirit will
   never go farther than the Cross and the coming of the Lord. He will go
   no farther than that which concerns Christ. "He shall receive of Mine."
   When, therefore, anybody whispers in my ear that there has been
   revealed to him this or that, which I do not find in the teaching of
   Christ and His Apostles, I tell him that we must be taught by the Holy
   Spirit. His one vocation is to deal with the things of Christ! If we do
   not remember this, we may be carried away by quirks, as many have been.
   Those who will have to do with other things, let them--but as for us,
   we shall be satisfied to confine our thoughts and our teaching within
   these limitless limits--"He shall take of Mine, and shall show it unto
   you."

   I like to think of the Holy Spirit handling such things. They seem so
   worthy of Him. Now has He got among the hills. Now is His mighty mind
   among the infinities when He has to deal with Christ, for Christ is the
   Infinite veiled in the finite. Why, He seems something more than
   Infinite when He gets into the finite, and the Christ of Bethlehem is
   less to be understood than the Christ of the Father's bosom! He seems,
   if it were possible, to have out-infinited the infinite, and the Spirit
   of God has themes here worthy of His vast Nature!

   When you have been the whole Sunday morning whittling away a text to
   the small end of nothing, what have you done? A king spent a day in
   trying to make a portrait on a cherrystone--a king who was ruling
   empires! And here is a minister who professes to have been called of
   the Holy Spirit to the employ of taking of the things of Christ, who
   spent a whole morning with precious souls who were dying while he spoke
   to them on a theme concerning which it did not signify the turn of a
   hair whether it was so or not! Oh, imitate the Holy Spirit! If you
   profess to have Him dwelling in you, be moved by Him! Let it be said of
   you, in your measure, as of the Holy Spirit without measure, "He shall
   receive of Mine and shall show it unto you."

   But, next, what does the Holy Spirit do? Why, He deals with feeble men.
   Yes, He dwells with us poor creatures! I can understand the Holy Spirit
   taking the things of Christ and rejoicing therein, but the marvel is
   that He should glorify Christ by coming and showing these things to us!
   And yet, Brothers, it is among us that Christ is to get His glory. Our

   eyes must see Him! An unseen Christ is little glorious. And the things
   of Christ unknown--the things of Christ untasted and unloved--seem to
   have lost their brilliance to a high degree. The Holy Spirit,
   therefore, feeling that to show a sinner the salvation of Christ
   glorifies Him, spends His time and has been spending these centuries in
   taking of the things of Christ and showing them to us. Ah, it is a
   great condescension on His part to show them to us. And it is a
   miracle, too. If it were reported that suddenly stones had life, hills
   had eyes and trees had ears, it would be a strange thing. But for us
   who were dead and blind and deaf in an awful sense--for the spiritual
   is more emphatic than the natural--for us to be so far gone and for the
   Holy Spirit to be able to show the things of Christ to us is to His
   honor! And He does it. He comes from Heaven to dwell with us. Let us
   honor and bless His name.

   I never could make up my mind which to admire most as an act of
   condescension--the Incarnation of Christ, or the indwelling of the Holy
   Spirit. The Incarnation of Christ is marvelous--that He should dwell in
   human nature, but, observe, the Holy Spirit dwells in human nature in
   its sinfulness--not in perfect human nature, but in imperfect human
   nature! And He continues to dwell, not in one body, which was fashioned
   strangely for Himself and was pure and without taint, but He dwells in
   our bodies! Know you not that they are the temples of the Holy Spirit,
   which were defiled by nature and in which a measure of defilement still
   remains, despite His indwelling? And this He has done these multitudes
   of years, not in one instance, nor in thousands of instances, but in a
   number that no man can number! He continues to come into contact with
   sinful humanity! Not to the angels, nor to the seraphim, nor to the
   cherubim, nor to the host who have washed their robes and made them
   white in the blood of the Lamb, does He show the things of Christ--but
   He shall show them to us!

   I suppose that it means this, that He takes of the words of our
   Lord--those which He spoke personally and by His Apostles. Let us never
   allow anybody to divide between the word of the Apostles and the word
   of Christ! Our Savior has joined them together. "Neither pray I for
   these, alone, but for them, also, which shall believe on Me through
   their word." And if any begin rejecting the Apostolic word, they will
   be outside the number for whom Christ prays--they shut themselves out
   by that very fact! I wish that they would solemnly remember that the
   word of the Apostles is the word of Christ. He tarried not long enough,
   after He had risen from the dead, to give us a further exposition of
   His mind and will. And He could not have given it before His death,
   because it would have been unsuitable. "I have yet many things to say
   unto you, but you cannot bear them now." After the descent of the Holy
   Spirit, the disciples were prepared to receive that which Christ spoke
   by His servants, Paul and Peter, and James and John.

   Certain doctrines which we are sometimes taunted about as being not
   revealed by Christ, but by His Apostles, were all revealed by Christ,
   every one of them! They can all be found in His teaching, but they are
   very much in the parabolic form. It is after He has gone up into Glory
   and has prepared a people, by His Spirit, to understand the Truths of
   God more fully, that He sends His Apostles and says, "Go forth, and
   open up to those whom I have chosen out of the world the meaning of all
   I said." The meaning is all there, just as all the New Testament is in
   the Old! And sometimes I have thought that, instead of the Old being
   less inspired than the New, it is more inspired! Things are packed away
   more tightly in the Old Testament than in the New, if possible. There
   are worlds of meaning in one pregnant line in the Old Testament--and in
   Christ's words it is just so. He is the Old Testament to which the
   Epistles come in as a kind of New Testament, but they are all one and
   indivisible--they cannot be separated.

   Well, now, the words of the Lord Jesus, and the words of His Apostles,
   are to be expounded to us by the Holy Spirit. We shall never get at the
   center of their meaning apart from His teaching. We shall never get at
   their meaning at all if we begin disputing about the words, saying, "I
   cannot accept the words." If you will not have the shell, you will
   never have the chick! It is impossible. "The words are not Inspired,"
   they say. Here is a man in the witness box and he has sworn to speak
   the truth and he says that he has. And now he is cross-examined and he
   says, "Now, I have spoken the truth, but I do not stand by my words."
   The cross-examining lawyer has got hold of a certain statement of his.
   The witness says, "Oh, I do not swear to the words, you know." The
   question is asked, "What, then, do you swear to? There is nothing else.
   We do not know anything about your meaning. All that you have sworn to
   must be your words." But what the fellow means is this--he is a liar.
   He is a perjurer. Well, I say no more than commonsense would suggest to
   you if you were sitting in a court. Now, if a man says, "I have spoken
   the truth, but still I do not swear to the words," what is left? If we
   have no Inspiration in the Words of God, we have got an impalpable
   Inspiration that oozes away between your fingers and leaves nothing
   behind!

   Well, take the words and never dispute over them! Still, into their
   soul-fullness of meaning you cannot come until the Holy Spirit shall
   lead you into them. They that wrote them for you did not fully
   understand what they wrote in many instances. There were some of them
   who enquired and searched diligently to know what manner of things
   those were which the Holy Spirit had spoken to them and of which He had
   made them speak. And you to whom the words come will have to do the
   same. You must go and say, "Great Master, we thank You for the Book
   with all our hearts. And we thank You for putting the Book into words.
   But now, good Master, we will not quibble over the letter, as did the
   Jews and the rabbis and the scribes of old, and so miss Your meaning.
   Open wide the door of the words, that we may enter into the secret
   closet of their meaning. Teach us this, we pray You. You have the key.
   Lead us in."

   Dear Friends, whenever you want to understand a text of Scripture, try
   to read the original. Consult anybody who has studied what the original
   means, but remember that the quickest way into a text is praying in the
   Holy Spirit. Pray the chapter over! I do not hesitate to say that if a
   chapter is read upon one's knees, looking up at every word to Him that
   gave it, the meaning will come to you with infinitely more light than
   by any other method of studying it. "He shall glorify Me: for He shall
   receive of Mine and shall show it unto you." He shall re-deliver the
   Master's message to you in the fullness of its meaning!

   But I do not think that is all that the text means. "He shall receive
   of Mine." In the next verse the Lord goes on to say, "All things that
   the Father has are Mine." I think that it means, therefore, that the
   Holy Spirit will show us the things of Christ. Here is a text for
   us--"The things of Christ." Christ speaks as if He had not any things,
   just then, which were specially His own, for He had not yet died. He
   had not yet risen. He was not pleading, then, as the great Intercessor
   in Heaven--all that was to come. But still, He says, "Even now all
   things that the Father has are Mine"--all His attributes, all His
   Glory, all His rest, all His happiness, all His blessedness. All that
   is Mine and the Holy Spirit shall show that to you."

   But I might almost read my text in another light, for He has died,
   risen and gone on high, and lo, He comes! His chariots are on the way!
   Now, there are certain things which the Father has and which Jesus
   Christ has, which are truly the things of Christ, emphatically the
   things of Christ. And my prayer is that you and I, preachers of the
   Gospel, might have this text fulfilled in us--"He shall take of
   Mine"--My things--"and shall show them unto you."

   Suppose, dear Brothers, that we are going to preach the Word, again,
   and the Holy Spirit shows to us our Master in His Godhead. Oh, how we
   will preach Him as Divine--how surely He can bless our congregation!
   How certainly He must be able to subdue all things unto Himself, seeing
   that He is very God of very God! It is equally sweet to see Him as Man.
   Oh, to have the Spirit's view of Christ's Manhood, distinctly to
   recognize that He is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh--and that in
   His infinite tenderness He will be compassionate to me and deal with my
   poor people and with the troubled consciences that are round me! I have
   still to go to them and tell them of One who is touched with the
   feeling of their infirmities, having been tempted in all points like as
   they still are! Oh, my Brothers, if we once, no, if every time before
   we preach, we get a view of Christ in His Divine and Human Natures and
   come down fresh from that vision to speak about Him, what glorious
   preaching it would be for our people!

   It is a glorious thing to get a view of the offices of Christ by the
   Holy Spirit, but especially of His office as a Savior! I have often
   said to Him, "You must save my people. It is no business of mine. I
   never set up in that line, or put over my door that I was a savior--but
   You have been apprenticed to this trade! You have learned it by
   experience and You claim it as Your own honor. You are exalted on high
   to be a Prince and a Savior. Do Your own work, my Lord." I took this
   text and used it with sinners the other Sunday night, and I know that
   God blessed it when I said to them, "May the Holy Spirit show you that
   Christ is a Savior! A physician does not expect you to make any
   apologies when you call upon him because you are ill, for he is a
   physician and he needs you in order that he may prove his skill. So
   Christ is a Savior and you need not apologize for going to Him! He
   cannot be a Savior if there is not somebody to be saved!" The fact is,
   Christ cannot get hold of us anywhere except by our sin. The point of
   contact between the sick one and the physician is the disease. Our sin
   is the point of contact between us and Christ. Oh, that the Spirit of
   God would take of Christ's Divine offices, especially that of a Savior,
   and show them unto us!

   Did the Holy Spirit ever show you these thing of Christ, namely, His
   Covenant engagements? When He struck hands with the Father, it was that
   He would bring many sons to Glory--that of those whom the Father gave
   Him, He would lose none, but that they should be saved, for He is under
   bonds to His Father to bring His elect Home. When the sheep

   have to pass, again, under the hands of Him that counts them, they will
   go under the rod, one by one, each one having the blood-mark--and He
   will never rest till the number in the heavenly fold shall tally with
   the number in the Book.

   So I believe and it has seemed delightful to me to have this shown to
   me when I have gone to preach. It is a dull, dreary, wet, foggy
   morning. There are only a few present. Yes, but they are picked people
   whom God has ordained to be there--and there will be the right number
   there! I shall preach and there will be some saved. We do not go at a
   chance, but, guided by the blessed Spirit of God, we go with a living
   certainty, knowing that God has a people that Christ is bound to bring
   Home and bring them Home He will! And while He shall see of the travail
   of His soul, His Father shall delight in every one of them! If you get
   a clear view of that, it will give you backbone and make you strong.
   "He shall take of Mine and shall show you my Covenant engagements, and
   when you see them, you shall be comforted."

   But, Beloved, the Holy Spirit favors you by taking what is peculiarly
   Christ's, namely, His love, and showing that to you. We have seen it,
   seen it sometimes more vividly than at other times. But if the full
   blaze of the Holy Spirit were to be concentrated upon the love of
   Christ--and our eyesight enlarged to its utmost capacity--it would be
   such a vision that Heaven could not excel it! We should sit with our
   Bible before us in our study and feel, "Well now, here is a man,
   whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell. Such a man is
   caught up into the third Heaven." Oh, to see the love of Christ in the
   light of the Holy Spirit! When it is so revealed to us, it is not
   merely the surface which we see, but the love of Christ itself! You
   know that you never saw anything yet, strictly speaking. You only see
   the appearance of the thing-- the light reflected by it--that is all
   you see. But the Holy Spirit shows us the naked Truth of God, the
   essence of the love of Christ! And what that essence is--that love
   without beginning, without change, without limit, without end--and that
   love set upon His people simply from motives within Himself. And from
   no motive ab extra--what that must be, what tongue can tell? Oh, it is
   a ravishing sight!

   I think that if there could be one sight more wonderful than the love
   of Christ, it would be the blood of Christ--

   "Much we talk of Jesus' blood, But how little's understood."

   It is the climax of God! I do not know of anything more Divine. It
   seems to me as if all the eternal purposes worked up to the blood of
   the Cross and then worked from the blood of the Cross towards the
   sublime consummation of all things. Oh, to think that He should become
   Man! God has made spirit, pure spirit, embodied spirit--and then
   materialism--and somehow, as if He would take all up into one, the
   Godhead links Himself with the material and He wears dust about Him
   even as we wear it! And taking it all up, He then goes and, in that
   fashion, redeems His people from all the evil of their soul, their
   spirit and their body by the pouring out of a life which, while it was
   Human, was so in connection with the Divine, that we speak correctly of
   "the blood of God."

   Turn to the 20th chapter of Acts and read how the Apostle Paul puts
   it--"Feed the Church of God, which He has purchased with His own
   blood." I believe that Dr. Watts is not wrong when he says--"God that
   loved and died." It is an incorrect accuracy, a strictly absolute
   accuracy of incorrectness! So it must be ever when the finite talks of
   the Infinite. It was a wonderful Sacrifice that could absolutely
   obliterate, annihilate and extinguish sin and all the traces that could
   possibly remain of it, for, "He has finished the transgression, made an
   end of sins, made reconciliation for iniquity and brought in
   everlasting righteousness." Ah, dear Friends, you have seen this, have
   you not? But you have yet to see more of it. And when we get to Heaven,
   we shall then know what that blood means--and with what vigor shall we
   sing, "Unto Him that loved us and washed us from our sins in His own
   blood"! Will anybody be there to say, "Is not that the religion of the
   shambles?" as they blasphemously call it. Ah, my Friends, they will
   find themselves where they will wish they had believed "the religion of
   the shambles"! And I think that it will burn like coals of juniper into
   the soul of any man that has ever dared to talk like that, that he did
   despite unto the blood of God and so, by his own willful deeds, will be
   cast away forever.

   May the Holy Spirit show unto you Gethsemane, Gabbatha and Golgotha!
   And then, may it please Him to give you a sight of what our Lord is now
   doing! Oh, how it would cheer you up at any time when you were
   depressed, only to see Him standing and pleading for you! Do you not
   think that if your wife were ill, your child were sick and there was
   hardly any food in the cupboard--if you were to go out the back door
   and you saw Him with the breastplate on, and all the stones
   glittering--and your name there and Him pleading for you--don't you
   think you would go in and say, "There, Wife, it is all right, He is
   praying for us"? Oh, it would be a comfort if the Holy Spirit showed
   you a pleading Christ!

   And then, to think that He is reigning as well as pleading! He is at
   the right hand of God, even the Father, who has put all things under
   His feet. And He waits till the last enemy shall lie there. Now, you
   are not afraid, are you, of those who have been snubbing you and
   opposing you? Remember, He has said, "All power is given unto Me in
   Heaven and in earth. Go you therefore, and teach all nations; and lo, I
   am with you always, even unto the end of the world."

   Next, and best of all, may the Holy Spirit give you a clear view of His
   coming. This is our most brilliant hope--"Lo, He comes!" The more the
   adversary waxes bold and the less of faith there is, and when zeal
   seems almost extinct, these are the tokens of His coming. The Lord
   always said that He would not come unless there was first a falling
   away. And so the darker the night grows and the fiercer the storm
   becomes, the better will we remember that He of the lake of Galilee
   came to them upon the waves in the night when the storm was wildest.
   Oh, what will His enemies say when He comes? When they behold the
   nail-prints of the Glorified and the Man with the Crown of thorns--when
   they see Him really come, they that have despised His Word and His
   ever-blessed blood--how will they flee before that face of injured
   love! And we, on the contrary, through His infinite mercy, will say,
   "This is what the Holy Spirit showed us and now we behold it literally!
   We thank Him for the foresights which He gave us of the Beatific
   Vision."

   I am not yet done on the first head, because there is one point which I
   want you to remember. When the Holy Spirit takes of the things of
   Christ and shows them to us, He has a purpose in so doing. You will not
   laugh, I hope, when I remind you of what the little boys sometimes do
   at school with one another. I have seen a boy take out of his pocket an
   apple and say to his schoolmate, "Do you see that apple?" "Yes," says
   the other. "Then, you may see me eat it," he says. But the Holy Spirit
   is no Tantalus, taking of the things of Christ and holding them up to
   mock us! No. He says, "Do you see these things? If you can see them,
   you may have them." Did not Christ, Himself, say, "Look unto Me, and be
   you saved, all the ends of the earth"? Looking gives you a claim and if
   you can see Him, He is yours! It is with you, with regard to the Spirit
   showing you things, as it was with Jacob. You know Jacob lay down and
   went to sleep. And the Lord said to him, "The land whereon you lie, to
   you will I give it." Now, wherever you go, throughout the whole of
   Scripture, if you can find a place where you can lie down, that is
   yours! If you can sleep on a promise, that promise is yours! "Lift up
   now your eyes," said God to Abraham, "and look from the place where
   you, are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all
   the land which you see, to you will I give it."

   May the Lord increase our holy vision of delighted faith, for there is
   nothing we see but we may also enjoy--all that is in Christ is there
   for us!

   II. Now, secondly, WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT AIMS AT AND WHAT HE REALLY
   ACCOMPLISHES. "He shall glorify Me."

   Ah, Brothers, the Holy Spirit never comes to glorify us, or to glorify
   a denomination, or, I think, even to glorify a systematic arrangement
   of doctrines! He comes to glorify CHRIST! If we want to be in accord
   with Him, we must preach in order to glorify Christ. May we never have
   this thought--"I will put that bit in. It will sound well. The friends
   will feel that oratory is not quite extinct, that Demosthenes lives
   again in this village." No, no! I would say, "Brother, though it is a
   very delightful piece, strike that out because if you have had a
   thought of that kind about it, you had better not put yourself in the
   way of temptation by using it." "Yes, that is a magnificent sentence! I
   do not know where I met with it, or whether it is my own. I am afraid
   that most of our friends will not understand it, but then it will give
   them an impression that they have a deep thinker in their pulpit." Well
   then, it may be very admirable and, further, it might be a very right
   thing to give them that precious piece; but if you have that thought
   about it, strike it out! Strike it out ruthlessly! Say, "No, no, no! If
   it is not distinctly my aim to glorify Christ, I am not in accord with
   the aim of the Holy Spirit and I cannot expect His help! We shall not
   be pulling the same way and, therefore, I will have nothing of which I
   cannot say that I am saying it simply, sincerely and only that I may
   glorify Christ."

   How, then, does the Holy Spirit glorify Christ? It is very beautiful to
   think that He glorifies Christ by showing Christ's things. If you
   wanted to do honor to a man, you would, perhaps, take him a present to
   decorate his house. But here, if you want to glorify Christ, you must
   go and take the things out of Christ's house--"the things of Christ."
   Whenever we have to praise God, what do we do? We simply say what He
   is! "You are this and You are that." There is no other praise. We
   cannot fetch anything from anywhere else and bring it to God--the
   praises of God are simply the facts about Himself! If you want to
   praise the Lord Jesus Christ, tell the people about Him. Take of the
   things of Christ and show them to the people--and you will glorify
   Christ.

   Alas, I know what you will do. You will weave words together and you
   will form and fashion them in a marvelous manner till you have produced
   a charming piece of literature. When you have carefully done that, put
   it in the fire under the oven--and let it burn! Possibly you may help
   to bake some bread with it. Brethren, it is better for us to tell what
   Christ is than to invent 10,000 fine words of praise in reference to
   Him. "He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall show
   it unto you."

   Again, I think that the blessed Spirit glorifies Christ by showing us
   the things of Christ as Christ's. Oh, to be pardoned! Yes, it is a
   great thing, but to find that pardon in His wounds--that is a greater
   thing! Oh, to get peace! Yes, but to find that peace in the blood of
   His Cross! Brothers, have the blood-mark very visibly on all your
   mercies! They are all marked with the blood of the Cross, but sometimes
   we think so much of the sweetness of the bread, or of the coolness of
   the waters, that we forget from where these came and how they came--and
   then they lack their choicest flavor. That it came from Christ is the
   best thing about the best thing that ever came from Christ! That He
   saves me is, somehow, better than my being saved! It is a blessed thing
   to go to Heaven, but I do not know that it is not a better thing to be
   in Christ and so, as the result of it, to get into Heaven. It is
   Himself and that which comes of Himself that becomes best of all
   because it comes of Himself! So the Holy Spirit shall glorify Christ by
   making us see that these things of Christ are, indeed, of Christ, and
   completely of Christ--and still are in connection with Christ--and we
   only enjoy them because we are in connection with Christ.

   Then it is said in the text, "He shall glorify Me: for He shall take of
   Mine and shall show it unto you." Yes, it does glorify Christ for the
   Holy Spirit to show Christ to us. How often I have wished that men of
   great minds might be converted! I have wished that we could have a few
   Miltons and such men, to sing of the love of Christ. A few mighty men
   who teach politics and the like, to consecrate their talents to the
   preaching of the Gospel. Why is it not so? Well, because the Holy
   Spirit does not seem to think that that would be the way to supremely
   glorify Christ and He prefers, as a better way, to take us commonplace
   sort of persons and to take the things of Christ and to show them to
   us. He does glorify Christ and, blessed be His name that ever my bleary
   eyes should look upon His infinite loveliness! That ever such a wretch
   as I, who can understand everything but what I ought to understand,
   should be made to comprehend the heights and depths and to know, with
   all saints, the love of Christ that passes knowledge!

   You see, in a school, that clever boy. Well, it is not much for the
   master to have made a scholar of him. But here is one who shines as a
   scholar and his mother says that he was the greatest dolt in the
   family! All his schoolfellows say, "Why, he was the butt of all our
   jokes! He seemed to have no brains, but our master, somehow, got some
   brains into him and made him know something which he appeared, at one
   time, incapable of knowing." Somehow, it does seem to be as if our very
   folly, impotence and spiritual death--if the Holy Spirit shows to us
   the things of Christ--will go towards the increase of that great
   glorifying of Christ at which the Holy Spirit aims!

   Then, Beloved Brothers, since it is for the honor of Christ for His
   things to be shown to men, He will show them to us, that we may go and
   show them to other people. This we cannot do, except as He is with us
   to make the others to see. But He will be with us while we tell forth
   what He has taught us and so the Holy Spirit will really be showing to
   others while He is showing to us! A secondary influence will flow from
   this service, for we shall be helped to use the right means to make
   others see the things of Christ.

   III. Our time is almost gone, but in the third place I must just point
   out to you HOW HE IS, IN BOTH OF THESE THINGS, OUR COMFORTER. He is so,
   first, for this reason--that there is no comfort in the world like a
   sight of Christ. He shows to us the things of Christ. Oh, Brothers, if
   you are poor and if the Holy Spirit shows you that Christ had not where
   to lay His head, what a sight for you! And if you are sick and if the
   Holy Spirit shows you what sufferings Christ endured, what comfort
   comes to you! If you are made to see the things of Christ, each thing
   according to the condition which you are in, how speedily you are
   delivered out of your sorrow!

   And then, if the Holy Spirit glorifies Christ, that is the cure for
   every kind of sorrow. He is the Comforter. I may have told you before,
   but I cannot help telling you again, that many years ago, after the
   terrible tragedy in the Surrey Gardens, [See "Emotional Trial by
   'Fire!'"-- http://www.pilgrimpublications.com/agonies.htm eod] I had to
   go away into the country and keep quite still. The very sight of the
   Bible made me cry. I could only keep alone in the garden and I was
   heavy and sad, for people had been killed and there I was, half dead,
   myself.

   And I remember how I got back my comfort and I preached on the Sabbath
   after I recovered. I had been walking round the garden and I was
   standing under a tree. If it is there now, I should know it and I
   remember these words-- "Him has God exalted with His right hand to be a
   Prince and a Savior." "Oh," I thought to myself, "I am only a common
   soldier. If I die in a ditch, I do not care. The King is honored. He
   wins the victory." And I was like those French soldiers in the old
   times who loved the emperor--and you know how, when they were dying, if
   he rode by, the wounded man would raise himself up on his elbow and cry
   once more, "Vive V Empereur!" for the emperor was engraved on his
   heart! And so, I am sure, it is with everyone of you, my Brothers, in
   this holy war! If our Lord and King is exalted, then let other things
   go which way they like. If He is exalted, never mind what becomes of
   us. We are a set of pigmies--it is all right if He is exalted! God's
   Truth is safe. We are perfectly willing to be forgotten, derided,
   slandered, or anything else that men please. The cause is safe and the
   King is on the Throne. Hallelujah! Blessed be His name! Amen.

Barriers Broken Down

   (No. 2214)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 26, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God." Romans 10:3.

   You that have your Bibles open, kindly follow me from the first verse
   of the chapter. It begins, "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to
   God for Israel is that they might be saved." If you really desire that
   men should be saved, pray for them! It is an empty wish, a mere
   formality, if you do not turn it into prayer. Every loving desire for
   any man or woman should, by the Believer, be taken before God in
   prayer. We cannot expect that God will save men unless His people pray
   for it. There must be travail before the birth and there must be
   travail in prayer with God before we can expect that many will be born,
   again, into the Church of God. Oh, for more prayer! Let us cry to God
   in secret, in the family and in all our assemblies, that God would save
   the sons of men!

   But prayer, if it is sincere, is always attended with effort. Therefore
   the Apostle begins to teach as well as to pray. He prays that Israel
   might be saved and then he explains the difficulties in the way and
   tries to remove them. You pray, dear Friend, do you? But you never
   speak to the individual for whom you pray. Is your prayer sincere? I
   will not question it. But your prayer has hardly reached that pitch of
   passionate earnestness which will secure an answer, for if you were in
   downright earnest, you would go to the person for whom you pray and
   explain the way of salvation! You want your boy to be a scholar. Then
   you send him to school. You want your girl to learn a certain trade.
   You put her apprentice to it, do you not? In the things of common life,
   that which you desire you use means to obtain. Oh, that in all our
   Churches we might feel that while effort without prayer is presumption
   and prayer without effort is hypocrisy, the holy blending of prayer and
   labor will produce, for certain, a grand result!

   If we labor for souls, we must not be content unless souls are really
   saved, for the Apostle says, "For I bear them record that they have a
   zeal for God." Well, does not that satisfy you, Paul? They are zealous
   for God! They are red-hot! "No," he says, "not unless it is in the
   right way. They have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge."
   We feel very thankful when we see tears stream down the cheeks, but,
   you know, people cry at the theater and there is not much in it. Pray
   God it may not end in a shower of tears, but that the heart may bleed
   as well as the eyes weep! It may happen that we have induced our
   Hearers to give up some outward sins. So far, so good. But it is
   written, "You must be born again." And if this vital change is not
   experienced, all outward reformation will land them short of Heaven!
   Beloved, the Apostle's love for souls led him to pray and led him to
   labor--but it led him to be very concerned that none should stop short
   of real living faith in Christ--and justification by His blood and
   righteousness.

   When we are in the throes of a revival and we think men are turning to
   Christ, let us be happy and let us not throw any cold water upon
   anybody--but let us see that it is really the work of Grace in the
   hearts of our Hearers. Let us take care that the plowshare goes down
   deep. Some soil needs even cross-plowing and scarifying. Let us do the
   work thoroughly, for it is only those that are really converted that
   will stand. We do not need a lot of people that will run in at one door
   of the Church and out at the other--we want saving work and our prayer
   should be--"Lord, quicken the people into Divine Life by Divine Truth,
   through the Divine Spirit!"

   Now observe that the Apostle, being thus earnest about souls, endeavors
   to be especially clear about the doctrine of Justification by Faith. If
   we want men to be truly converted, we must set before them the plan of
   salvation very clearly and distinctly. I meet with hundreds of persons
   who have had some kind of work upon their hearts, but they tell me that
   they walk in a mist. They have not quite understood it. They feel that
   they are on the Rock, but they were not quite sure

   what the Rock really is. It is a good thing that our zeal for God
   should be according to knowledge, that we know what we believe and why
   we believe it. That we know that we are saved, how we are saved and why
   we are saved, for if there is a mistake here, it may be fatal!

   Martin Luther, who, as we all know, continually preached the doctrine
   of Justification by Faith, said, one day, that he felt half inclined to
   take the Bible and bang it about the people's heads, for they seemed as
   if they would not get a hold of the doctrine that we are saved by faith
   in Jesus Christ and by Him, alone! I suspect that knocking people's
   heads about with the Bible would not effect any very great result--but
   that was Martin Luther's way of putting it. Keep hammering away on that
   nail--"Believe, believe, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you
   shall be saved." Well, now, that was the particular battleground of
   Luther's day, so that he said, "The doctrine of Justification by Faith
   is the article of a standing or a falling church." If a Church holds
   and preaches that, it is a Church of Christ, notwithstanding many
   blunders. But, whatever it may preach, if it does not preach that, it
   is to be questioned whether it is not a fallen church, a church that
   has lost its true position.

   The fight today is the same as in Luther's day. The words have changed
   and men make other pretenses, but the fight all along the line is still
   this--Are we saved by our own merits, or by the merits of another? Are
   we righteous through what we do, or are we righteous through what
   Christ has done? Is sin put away by tears and repentances, or is sin
   washed away by the precious blood of Christ and by that alone? Beloved,
   I trust that our pulpit will never give an uncertain sound upon this
   matter!

   In our discourse we shall endeavor to show you that while there are two
   righteousnesses, our own righteousness and the righteousness of God,
   there will always be, as there has always been, a conflict between the
   two. Men will choose their own righteousness and they will not submit
   themselves to the righteousness of God.

   You that are fellow workers for Christ will be especially interested in
   this text, for it sets forth three difficulties in the way of a man's
   salvation. The first is ignorance--"They, being ignorant of God's
   righteousness." The next is self-will--"And going about to establish
   their own righteousness." And the third is flat rebellion--"Have not
   submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."

   I. Well, now, our first difficulty is with IGNORANCE. "Ignorance is the
   mother of devotion," according to the Church of Rome. "Ignorance is the
   mother of error," according to the Word of God. We love the spread of
   knowledge, although there is a knowledge which it were better not to
   know, as there is a philosophy that is nothing but vain deceit and not
   true wisdom. What we want our fellow men to possess is spiritual
   knowledge. Especially do we desire that they may have, first and
   chiefly, knowledge with regard to God's righteousness, for the
   difficulty is that men do not know what that righteousness is which God
   requires.

   Do you want to be saved by your own righteousness? Do you know what
   kind of righteousness it must be? To be accepted, it must be perfect.
   That is to say, if you have committed but one sin, you have stained
   your character in the sight of God and your hope of perfect
   righteousness is gone. God's Law requires obedience from the first
   moment that the creature understands that Law, as long as that creature
   lives. Mark what it requires of you--"You shall love the Lord your God
   with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
   strength, and with all your mind." Have you done that? "And your
   neighbor as yourself." Have you done that? Why, there is not one of us
   who has done it! If we had kept the Law of God completely, from the
   first command to the last, from the first day until now--even that
   would not save us, for, if there were to be one sinful word or deed
   during the rest of life, it would spoil the whole--and God could not
   accept our righteousness.

   When a man commits one sin, he is guilty of disobedience to all the
   commands of God, for, "he that offends in one point is guilty of all."
   Here is a chain containing 20 links. If I break one of them, I have
   broken the chain. True, there are 19 perfect links, but if number 10 is
   snapped, down goes the cage over the mouth of the mine and the miners
   are killed! Suppose that I should be required to produce a perfect vase
   of alabaster, or clear crystal, as a present to the Queen? But my maid
   has chipped it just a little. What is to be done? I may possibly find
   somebody to use some patent cement and fasten the little pieces in
   their places, but when all is done, it is chipped--it is not
   perfect--and if it must be perfect before royalty can accept it, I must
   get another vase, for this one will not do.

   Now, dear Friend, while I am talking to you about a chip, here, and a
   chip, there, in your life, I am sure you must be saying, "Do not talk
   so, Sir. Why, some of us have not only got chipped, but we are smashed
   right up! And as to broken

   links, why, we have fairly melted the chain--there is not a link left.
   We have nothing, absolutely nothing, that we can bring before God." I
   am glad to hear it! If you are lost, you are the very ones Christ came
   to save. And if you have no righteousness of your own, you have got to
   the halfway house of salvation! When you strip a man, you are partly on
   the way to clothing him. When a man is changing his old clothes for
   better, he must first get the old ones off. Oh, how glad I am to meet
   with a real sinner! There are many sham sinners about. I saw, one day,
   in Italy, a fellow sticking out his arm with an awful sore and he
   begged of me. As I suspected that he had manufactured that sore with a
   little sulfuric acid, or by some such process, I did not feel the least
   pity for him. We have lots of people who come confessing their
   sins--"Oh, yes, we are sinners! We are sinners!" They do not mean
   it--they are only sham sinners. A real sinner, one who feels his guilt,
   is a "sacred thing," as Hart says, "the Holy Spirit has made him so."
   He is an empty vessel that God is going to fill! He is a broken heart
   that God is going to make new! But our trouble is that the mass of
   people are not aware how perfect and how complete any righteousness
   must be before God can accept it.

   The next difficulty is that men do not know that God has provided a
   righteousness for all Believers. For every soul born of Adam who will
   believe in Christ, there is a perfect righteousness! Not ours, but
   God's. God came here in human form not bound to be obedient, but,
   "being found in fashion as a man, He became obedient"--obedient to His
   own Law and fulfilled every jot and tittle of it. He was "obedient unto
   death, even the death of the Cross." And His obedience is ours if we
   believe! God looks at us as if we had done what His Son has done!
   Christ died and rose again--and God regards us as having died in Him
   and reckons that we are risen with Him and now live in Him! Our
   righteousness is the righteousness of Another, even of the Son of
   God--a perfect righteousness, a Divine righteousness, an everlasting
   righteousness! In the Book of Daniel it is written that Messiah, the
   Prince, should "finish the transgression, make an end of sins, make
   reconciliation for iniquity and bring in everlasting righteousness." He
   was "made sin for us, Who knew no sin, that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him."

   Alas, how many there are who do not know that God justifies the
   ungodly--that sinners can be regarded as just through what Christ has
   done and suffered and, that, believing in the precious Christ whom God
   has set forth to be a Propitiation, the vilest are fair to look upon in
   God's esteem and the far-off ones are made near by the blood of Christ!
   Oh, I wish that men knew it! I have sometimes thought that if they did
   but know it, if they did but really hear the Gospel, they must believe
   it. You that preach Christ in the streets, go on preaching Him! I saw a
   man preaching, the other day, with no creature but one dog to listen to
   him and I really thought that he might as well have gone home. But I
   met with a story yesterday which I know to be true and it showed me
   that I was making a mistake. There was a woman who, for years, had been
   in such dreadful despair that she would not even listen to the Gospel.

   She came to be very ill and she said to one that called upon her, "You
   sent a man to preach under my window three months ago and I got a
   blessing." "No," the friend said, "I never sent anybody to preach under
   your window." "Oh," she said, "I think you did, for he came and
   preached and my maid said that there was nobody listening to him. I did
   not want to hear him, but as he made so much noise, my maid shut the
   window and I lay down in bed. But the man shouted so, that I was
   obliged to hear him, and I thank God I did, for I heard the Gospel and
   I found Christ! Did you not send him?" "No," said the good man, "I did
   not." "Well," she said, "then God did! There was nobody in the street
   listening to him, but I heard the Gospel--and I got out of my despair
   and I found the Savior--and I am prepared to die."

   Fire away, Brothers! You do not know where your shot will strike, but,
   "there's a billet for every bullet." I believe that there is some soul
   whom God means to bless whenever we preach the Gospel, depending upon
   His Grace. But the mass of mankind are ignorant of the righteousness
   which God requires and ignorant of the righteousness which God has
   provided.

   Many are ignorant as to how they are to receive this righteousness. If
   there is such a righteousness, they say, how are we to get it? The
   current notion is, "I must pray so much. I must weep so much. I must
   feel so much." Ah, this is the common ignorance, whereas men should
   know that--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One." "Why, everybody
   preaches this," says someone. I know they do, but people do not
   understand it, although you keep on preaching it, for until God the
   Holy Spirit makes men to know the meaning of what you say, they will
   but nod their heads and pass on. Though I heard the Gospel from my
   childhood and was brought up upon the very knee of piety, I did not
   understand what I must do to be saved till I heard that text preached
   from--"Look unto Me and be you saved, all the

   ends of the earth." I do not believe that my ignorance was the fault of
   the preacher. It was certainly not the fault of my father, or my
   mother--and not the fault of the Bible which I had read through, again
   and again--it was the fault of these dim eyes that I could not see! Go
   on! Go on, you preachers of the Word! Spread abroad the knowledge of
   this great fact, that, "He that believes on the Son has everlasting
   life."

   The worst of this terrible ignorance is that the mass of mankind do not
   know HIM who is our Righteousness. Who is the Righteousness of God? Who
   is the Blessed One? God's only-begotten Son! God, the Word made flesh,
   born at Bethlehem, nurtured in the carpenter's shop, toiling here below
   and wearing His life away for the souls of men--extending His arms upon
   the Cross. Giving His side to be pierced, His soul to be breathed out,
   His body to be laid in the tomb that men might be saved! O Jesus, in
   Your wounds is our salvation, but men do not know it! O Jesus, Your
   death is the death of sin, Your life is our life unto God--but men do
   not know it! Alas, alas, men still go on in their blindness and
   ignorance! Still is the Lord of Life despised and rejected of men and
   still His servants cry, "Who has believed our report? And to whom is
   the arm of the Lord revealed?"

   You see our great difficulty is human ignorance--ignorance, dear
   Friends, even of the facts of the Truth of God. You do not know how
   near to this place, in the very midst and heart of London, there are
   tens of thousands who do not know the name of Christ! You think it
   incredible, but I know that it is so. There are multitudes that have
   never read a chapter in the Word of God since they went to Sunday
   school as children. And they never darken the threshold of God's House.
   There are streets, in neighborhoods not far from here, where, if one
   man goes to a place of worship, he is marked by all his neighbors as a
   strange character. Let me turn aside for a moment and ask you how, in
   this city of London, are we to get the Gospel to the working men--to a
   great number of them? How does it get to some of them?

   How? Oh, little Mary sings it on father's knee on Sunday night. He has
   not been out to a place of worship, but his little girl has been to the
   Sunday school. Or his son Jack has been to the mission and comes home
   and tells his father what the preacher said. He will listen to his own
   children when he will listen to no one else! The way to increase the
   number of those who are not ignorant is for us so to see the things of
   Christ that others who have never seen them may have, from us, an
   intimation of what we have seen! Oh, it must be very painful to a blind
   man for another to say to him, "Now I am looking over a delightful
   landscape. Over there I can see a beautiful piece of water and beyond
   the hills I see the sea. There is a ship going along." "Oh," the man
   says, "I wish I had eyes that I could see, too!" The Holy Spirit makes
   us see, so that, as we tell the story, we may set others longing to
   also see.

   I think I reminded you once before, that when the prodigal came back,
   his father said, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put
   a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet." But, you will notice, he
   never fed him. The father does not say anything about that. He says,
   "Bring here the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be
   merry." Well, it is the servants and all the rest of the household that
   are to eat. There is nothing said about killing the fatted calf for the
   prodigal. No, no, you see he had lost his appetite, and others must
   begin to eat, first, and then, when they began to eat, he was sure to
   join in with them. There is no surer way of begetting an appetite than
   seeing other people eating. Let us enjoy the things of Christ so much
   that poor sinners' mouths will water and they will begin to ask, "What
   is your Beloved more than any other beloved? What is this righteousness
   of which you speak? What is this wonderful thing?" We have need to tell
   others what we know, for ignorance, even of the simple facts of the
   Gospel, is extremely common.

   Others are in great ignorance as to the excellence of the Gospel. They
   do not know the peace, the joy, the rest it brings--

   "His worth if all the nations Anew, Sure the whole world would love Him
   too." But they think that it is all mere talk--a something all very
   well for parsons and for some few other people to get a hold of--but
   nothing for the working man, nothing for the man of business, nothing
   for your noble gentleman who has his heaven at Newmarket and his bliss
   at Epsom. Ah, dear Friends, I would to God they knew the Pearl of Great
   Price, the incomparable value of salvation by blood--for then would
   they reckon the highest glory of this present world as unworthy to be
   compared with the least delight of the Kingdom of God!

   With many, this ignorance is willful. Nobody is so blind as the man
   that does not want to see! Nobody so deaf as the man that does not wish
   to hear! Many are like the hogs in harvest--very deaf when they are
   told to get out of the cornfield. And so, when sinners run riot in
   their sins, they are very deaf, indeed, when they are told to quit them
   and fly to

   Christ for refuge! Some of you, perhaps, do not want to know too much.
   When you come to that part of the Bible that begins to touch your
   conscience, you say, "Shut that up." You will go on somewhere else. You
   do not want to know! Willful ignorance will bring terrible damnation.
   If there is salvation and you do not want to know it, then you deserve
   to be cast away.

   There are some who are ignorant despairingly and I pity them, poor
   souls! They sigh and cry, "Oh, I cannot be saved, I am so guilty. My
   heart is so hard!" The devil tells men, first, that they can be saved
   any day they like, so they may put it off. Then, immediately
   afterwards, he says, "Salvation is not for such as you. You never had
   enough sense of sin. You never will have enough faith. God will never
   save you." Ah, my dear Friend, I wish I could make you understand that
   whoever comes to Christ, He will in no wise cast out, for He, Himself,
   has said, "He that believes on Me has"--has now--"everlasting life." He
   shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck him out of Christ's
   hands. Some of us will give Christ great glory when we get to Heaven. I
   think that some people will meet us at the gate and say, "What? And
   have you got here?"

   I should not wonder if it was some elder brother. That elder brother
   was a good fellow. He was a real child and he was always with his
   father and all his father had was his. Yet he was surprised to see the
   prodigal come home after wasting his father's living. Ah, but it is
   those that cost the Lord so much in whom His infinite Grace will be
   displayed! They will glorify Him most. O you despairing ones, if you
   must faint, faint away on to the bosom of Christ! Swoon away into the
   arms of the almighty Savior and then it will be well to have swooned
   and you will find, in Him, your strength!

   II. There is another thing that stands in our way that is worse than
   ignorance and that is SELF-WILL. Men, ignorant of God's righteousness,
   are said to be "going about to establish their own righteousness." In
   other words, to set up the poor idol of their own righteousness. Man
   sees God's righteousness and, instead of accepting it, he says, "I
   think I could match that. I will set up my own righteousness!" There is
   a treasure of gold and the man says, "No, I will not have that. I think
   that I could make a sovereign at home out of a bit of brass." Fool that
   he is! How shall he mimic God? If I were at Heaven's wide-open gate and
   a voice should say, "Enter freely," and I replied, "No, I think I
   prefer the Surrey Hills, or a place down by the seaside," what a fool I
   would be! But, even then, not so great a fool as when forsaking the
   righteousness of God, I want to set up my own! A human thing at
   best--how shall that match the Divine righteousness? An imperfect thing
   at best--how shall I compare that with the perfect righteousness of
   Christ? A fading, floating thing, always apt to be damaged by the next
   moment's temptation--how can I be so foolish? A ridiculous thing, an
   ignominious thing, a filthy thing.

   Paul said that his righteousness, which was of the Law, was
   "blameless"--and yet he counted it dung--that he might win Christ!
   Dung, the most filthy thing! Here, scavenger, take it away! Have any of
   you any righteousness of your own? I do not believe that even the
   dustman would take it! He would say, "No, the carts are not for carting
   away man's righteousness--we have no place bad enough to shoot it
   into." Shoot it into the bottomless pit! No, even there they have not
   any righteousness, for they know their true condition. Human
   righteousness is a great lie--it is filthy rags. Away with it from off
   the face of the earth!

   What do men try to do? In what vain efforts are they spending their
   time and strength? According to the text, they go about "to establish
   their own righteousness." I think you will better understand it, if I
   read it, "They go about to set up their own righteousness." You see it
   is a dead thing. "See here," they say, "we will make it stand." If I
   had a corpse here--I am glad that I have not--well, I set it up and it
   tumbles down. Nevertheless, I will put its legs out a little wider and
   see whether it will stand. Down it goes! Now I will prop it up. Surely,
   I can make this dead thing stand. But, no, it has a tendency to
   fall--down it goes! Have I not seen a sinner try to set up the corpse
   of his own righteousness and make it stand? At last he has been obliged
   to say what the fool said in the old classic, "It needs something
   inside." And so it does, for until there is life within, it will not
   stand! Even so, our righteousness has no true vitality, no life within
   and it will not stand.

   Or, to use another illustration, it is like a man trying to patch up an
   old house. You find such in country villages--a place which nobody has
   ever repaired for 50 years! I do not know if there is any landlord, but
   if there is, he would like to forgot that he has such property! The
   main beam is nearly cracked through. The lath and plaster have gone,
   long ago, and the birds go in and out the best parlor, whenever they
   like--the whole thing is tumbling down. A man buys it and he says,
   "Now, you know, it is a pity to pull this house down. I think I will
   repair it." So he puts in a beam there, just under

   the roof, and he puts a strut here and another timber there and, by the
   time he has spent as much as would have built a new house, he has got a
   very handsome ruin left, but nothing more.

   I think it was Charles the First who used to swear, "God mend me."
   Somebody said it would be an easier job to make a new one of him and I
   believe it! When men say, "God mend me," they had better say, "God make
   me new." So, as to your righteousness, if you have a lot of it and it
   is very good. If you have been christened, or baptized, if you like,
   and confirmed and have always gone to your place of worship--and are so
   good that you wonder you can live in such a wicked world as this--if
   you have all that righteousness, the best thing to do with it is to get
   rid of it, for it will ruin your soul! But this is what men do--they
   try "to set up" their own righteousness.

   And then the text says that they "go about" to do this--"Going about to
   establish their own righteousness." That is to say, they set about it
   with great zeal. Some of you who know the Lord can remember how you
   thought you would do it. Why, at first, when you started as a young
   man, you were never going to do any wrong! You were going to have a
   perfect righteousness of your own. You had an ugly temper, however, and
   it broke out, indeed. "Well," you said, "I shall never do it again."
   You came down to breakfast and you were as bad-tempered as ever, so you
   said, "Never mind, I will set it up now. I will be a teetotaler. That
   will be a grand thing." So it was, but, somehow or other, down tumbled
   your righteousness again!

   Then you went to a place of worship. You said, "I will always be here."
   You began to think that you would grow into a saint, but you did not.
   Down tumbled your righteousness! Always it went and you, all the while,
   tried zealously to set it up. "Going about" implies great earnestness.
   When a man says, "I am going about a thing," he means that he is going
   to take his coat off--going to work in his shirtsleeves. He is going to
   toil at it for many hours. I remember how I set to work in my
   shirtsleeves to make a righteousness of my own! And I did very nicely,
   indeed, while it was dark. But when a little light from the Cross broke
   in, I began to see the filthiness of it. And you, my Friend, think
   yourself very beautiful when you cannot see yourself! But let the
   mirror be held before you, you would begin to see the spots of filth
   that defile the very best of your righteousness. Ah me, how foul the
   righteousness of men is--and yet they go about to set up their own
   righteousness.

   To "go about" to establish a righteousness means, in the next place,
   that men have varied ways of doing it. Shall I tell you what I
   frequently meet with? I have talked with a person and said, "Can you
   trust in your own works?" "Oh, no, Sir, I can never do that." "Well,
   can you come to Christ and take the righteousness of God?" "Well, Sir,
   no. I do not feel enough my own emptiness." Look! This man is going to
   bring his own emptiness to help him! He actually thinks that if he has
   not any righteousness, his own emptiness is good for something and, if
   he can get to feel that, he will come and bring his feelings of
   emptiness to commend him to Christ! Did you ever hear of such a thing?
   You go to him and you say, "My dear Man, salvation is not on account of
   your feelings." Each time you drive him out of his refuge of lies, he
   hastens back to the old ground again--something of himself.

   Suppose there is a ship out at sea and the people on board feel that
   they are safe. One of them says, "I know that we shall not drift far
   out of our course." "Why?" "Because we have such a big anchor on
   board." You say, "Ah, he is a cockney. He must be a fool who believes
   in an anchor on board." Why, it is no good to anybody! It is when you
   "let go" the anchor and lose sight of it--and the anchor gets an unseen
   grip down below, that it is good for something. But while the anchor is
   on board, it is only so much dead weight for the ship. You want to have
   your anchor on board, do you? You do not like it to "enter into that
   which is within the veil"--that is too mysterious. You want to feel
   something, to have something of your own. O pride! O self-will! God
   will have salvation to be all of Grace and man will have it of debt!

   God gives the promise of His Grace and man puts his penny down to pay
   for it! Men's pennies and God's promises do not go together very well
   to buy Heaven. He says, like a king, "You may have it for nothing," and
   we say, "Lord, we think we could make up a little something to buy it."
   Well, then, you will never have it! His terms are free, rich, Sovereign
   Grace--a sinner with nothing--receiving everything from God! He may
   have it. He may have it now. None can say no to him. But he stands
   chaffering, trying to pay his penny, as if God kept a shop! Has God
   come down to stand in your market and cry to you, "Here, bring your
   gold and your silver to purchase My favor"? You know not who He is, for
   all things are His! If He were hungry, He would not tell you, for the
   cattle on a thousand hills belong to Him. Will you have salvation
   freely? If so, take it freely. But if you will buy it, you and God can
   never agree.

   Let me just close this point about human will, by saying that the
   efforts of men for their own salvation are deadly efforts. God will
   save them one way, but they want to be saved by another! God says,
   "Here is medicine. Take it; drink it." Man says, "No, I will grow my
   own drugs in my own garden and I will compound my own medicine." And he
   goes and takes his own dose. And can he ever get well in such a way as
   that? God says, "I will forgive." Man says, "I will try and deserve to
   be forgiven," as if that could be possible. I have heard that the
   Romanists say that venial sins are a kind of sins that deserve to be
   forgiven. What sort of sin must that be? Yet some men seem to think
   that somehow or other they can deserve to be forgiven! That would not
   be forgiveness at all! Come, come, you vilest of the vile, you lost and
   utterly undone! Come, come, you that have no righteousness, or the
   ghost of a shade of a shadow of a pretense of any! Come as you are!
   There is everything you need in Christ. Come and have Him and you shall
   not be refused! But reject His terms and salvation can never be yours.

   III. Now, very briefly, I want to speak upon the third difficulty,
   which is a gross evil, namely, FLAT REBELLION.

   Observe my text, dear Friend, if you forget everything else. I say,
   remember what the Lord says--"They have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God." This is a strange word. "Have not submitted
   themselves." Do you not wonder that such a word is used? Here is a
   criminal who will not submit to be pardoned! Here is a sick man who
   will not submit to be made well! Here is a man with a broken leg who
   will not submit to have it healed! Here is a poor beggar in the street
   who will not submit to be made into a gentleman! Why, the word seems
   quite out of place, does it not? It shows you the monstrous absurdity
   of self-righteousness, that men will not submit themselves to that
   which is the greatest blessing that Heaven, itself, can bestow! It is a
   matter of submission.

   While it is a strange word, it is a very searching word. Is it so,
   that, the reason why I am not saved is that I will not submit? Do I
   stick out? Have I an iron sinew in my neck? Am I such a self-willed
   fool that I will not submit before my Maker--will not yield, even, to
   have salvation for nothing? Am I so proud that I scorn to be a pauper
   before God? That is just it. That is the reason why many have not
   peace. If they were bankrupts, if they were cleaned right out, they
   would have perfect rest of soul, but still they stand out and, in their
   self-righteousness, fight against God!

   It is a very true word. I am sure that there is many a sinner who has
   not anything to be proud of and yet he is as proud as Lucifer. Why,
   there are harlots that are proud of their own righteousness! There are
   drunks proud of their own righteousness! I do not know where they get
   it, but they are proud of it. I have heard say that a dustman can be as
   proud as my Lord Mayor. And so the vilest sinner can be proud of his
   own righteousness. "Why," you say, "he has nothing to be proud of!" No
   more have you--I mean you good, moral persons--you who never do
   anything wrong, as you think. You have not any more righteousness than
   he has, if it comes really to be measured up and tested by the Word of
   God. Still, it is so--the worse the man, the harder he is to bow before
   the righteousness of God.

   It is a very suggestive word. "They have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God." They will not acknowledge that God is King.
   They quarrel with His Sovereignty. How can the rebel be forgiven when
   he begins to question whether the king is king? When he begins to deny
   the rights of the magistrate to condemn him, how can he be pardoned?
   You must yield, my Friend! Submit to the fact that God is God, or else
   you will not submit to God's righteousness! Man thinks that God is
   hard, austere, demanding too much--and while God puts before him
   everything for nothing--yet still he says that the price is too high!
   It is his heart that is too high, his proud looks that need bringing
   down. Oh, that God would bring them down! The man will not submit to
   the power of God. He will not yield himself up to God to work with him,
   and in him and for him. He wants to do all himself and then, if he got
   to Heaven, he would throw his cap up and want to share the glory! But
   it will not do. It is all of Grace from first to last--and the sinner
   must consent that it shall be so or else the gate of Heaven will never
   give him admittance!

   Lastly, it is a very cheering word. "They have not submitted themselves
   to the righteousness of God." You ask, "And is that all that I have to
   do--to submit myself? Is that all?" There is a feather in the cap of
   your pride. Take it out! You have a weapon of rebellion by your side.
   Throw it down! Just submit yourself, with folded hands, with the rope
   around your neck. Say, "Lord, if my soul is sent to Hell, I deserve it.
   I submit and I plead for mercy. I plead the precious blood. I not only
   submit to take that plea, but I delight to take it. I am happy to
   believe that--

   'You have promised to forgive All who on Your Son believe. Lord, I know
   You cannot lie-- Give me Christ, or else I die.'"

   Beloved Friend, may the Holy Spirit lead you to submit! You have been
   kicking and struggling--now submit. You have been despairing and
   talking about its being presumptuous to believe. Submit! Give all that
   up. No more of your talk! Come to faith! When a man submits to God,
   that man has the victory. When God is King, you are safe. When you take
   Christ to be everything and you are nothing--then neither death nor
   Hell shall ever divide you from the heart of God! When you are not your
   own, you are Christ's, but so long as you are dependent upon self, you
   do not know the Lord and you cannot know Him.

   May God bless this simple testimony to each and all, and to His name be
   praise! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Romans 9.
     __________________________________________________________________

Young Man! A Prayer For You

   (No. 2215)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 2, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray, open his eyes, that he may
   see! And the Lord opened the eyes of the youngman, and he saw. And,
   behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around
   Elisha" 2 Kings 6:17.

   This young man waited upon a Prophet--he could not have had a more
   instructive occupation, yet his eyes needed to be opened. He was well
   disposed towards good things, for the tone of his language to his
   master shows that he was heartily at one with him--but his eyes were
   not yet half opened. Being in great alarm for his master's safety, he
   ran to him to warn him--good servants should be their master's best
   friends. In return, his believing master prays for him. If we desire
   the good of our servants, our children and our friends, let us take
   care that we make supplication for them! All that we can do for them at
   our best is to give them secondary blessings, but if we pray to God for
   them, they will receive the best of gifts from Him who sends down in
   His mercy nothing but good gifts and perfect gifts. When we have come
   to the end of our teaching, example and persuasion, let us hand our
   young friends over to the Lord who works effectually unto eternal
   salvation.

   Elisha's petition for this young man was, "O Lord, I pray, open his
   eyes, that he may see!" The young man was, at that time, in the
   peculiar condition of seeing and yet not seeing. He saw the enemy
   surrounding the city, but not the greater host of the Lord's angels who
   protected the man of God. Looking over the little walls of Dothan, he
   observed all the country round about to be occupied by the horses and
   chariots of the king of Syria. And he cried, "Alas, my Master! What
   shall we do?" He could see the danger, but he could not see the
   deliverance and, therefore, the Prophet lifted up his heart to Heaven
   and said, "O Lord, I pray, open his eyes, that he may see!" Elisha
   reckons his servant's natural sight as not seeing and regards the
   vision which detects the invisible as the only true sight.

   Perhaps I am addressing some, at this time, who are very friendly to
   the cause of God and are even connected with it by relationship or
   occupation. They cheerfully lend a hand at any time in holy service so
   far as they can and they wish prosperity to the cause of true religion.
   Yet their eyes have not been opened to see spiritual things or, at
   least, not sufficiently opened to see the gracious and Divine side of
   them. They see enough to perceive that they are in danger from a great
   enemy. They perceive that it is no easy thing to fight the battle of
   life and in the prospect of it they cry, "What shall we do?" They
   perceive that it is a difficult thing for a man to stand up for
   holiness, for truth, for integrity, for purity and to maintain a
   gracious character throughout the whole of life. They seem, to
   themselves, to be environed with opposing forces in their business, in
   their temperament, in their companionships and, perhaps, in their
   families. As for the cause of godliness, it seems hemmed in by
   adversaries and they ask--"What is to be done? Is not the matter
   desperate? Might it not be as well to surrender at once?" For any such
   timid one I would present to God the prayer of Elisha--"O Lord, I pray,
   open his eyes, that he may see!" Oh, that the prayer might be answered
   at this hour!

   Very briefly, I shall speak, first, upon our prayer. Secondly, upon our
   reason for offering such a petition. And thirdly, upon our hope, for we
   trust that if our prayer is answered, the person whose eyes are opened
   will behold a vision which will bless him beyond anything he has ever
   dreamed of.

   I. First, then, OUR PRAYER--"Lord, I pray, open the eyes of the young
   man, that he may see!" This petition bears many senses. I will mention
   only a few.

   For certain of our friends we pray that their eyes may be opened to see
   the enemy of their souls under the many disguises which he assumes. We
   fear that many are ignorant of his devices. Young men, especially, are
   too apt to mistake the

   great enemy for a friend. They believe his false and flattering words
   and are seduced to ruin. He holds forth to them the sparkling cup--but
   in its beaded bubbles death is lurking! He talks of "pleasure," but in
   the lusts of the flesh the pleasure is a shadow and misery is the
   substance! He wears the mask of prudence and admonishes young men to
   "mind the main chance," and leave religion till they have made their
   fortunes. But that gain which comes of thrusting God aside will prove
   to be an everlasting loss! The devil as a serpent does more mischief
   than as a roaring lion. If we had to meet the devil and knew him to be
   what he is, we might far more easily conquer him--but we have to deal
   with him disguised as an angel of light--and here is the need of a
   hundred eyes, each one of them opened by God, that we may see!

   Even worse than this is the fact that, at times, he does not meet us at
   all, but he undermines our path. He digs pits for our feet, he shoots
   his arrows from afar, or sends forth a pestilence which walks in
   darkness. Then have we need of a better sight than Nature gives. I
   would pray for the young man who is just leaving home to go into the
   world, "O Lord, open the eyes of the young man, that he may see!" May
   he be able to detect the falsehood which may hide itself beneath the
   truth, the meanness which may wrap itself about with pride, the folly
   which may robe itself in learning, the sin which may dress itself in
   the raiment of pleasure! I would not have you taken, like birds, in a
   snare. I would not have the youth led, like a bullock to the shambles,
   by the hand of temptation. Let us breathe such a prayer as that of
   Elisha for each person in this place who is beginning life. God grant
   that his eyes may be opened to see sin as sin and to see that evil
   never can be good, a lie never can be true and rebellion against our
   God can never be the way to happiness!

   We want men's eyes to be opened to see God as everywhere, observing all
   things. What an opening of the eyes this would be to many! It is a sad
   but true saying that God may be seen everywhere, but that the most of
   men see Him nowhere. He is blind, indeed, who cannot see HIM to whom
   the sun owes its light. Until our eyes are opened, we rise in the
   morning, we fall asleep at night and we have not seen God all day,
   although He has been every moment around us and within us! We live from
   the first day of January to the last day of December--and while the
   Lord never ceases to see us, we do not even begin to see Him till, by a
   miracle of Grace--He opens our eyes! We dwell in a wonderful world
   which the great Creator has made, filled with His own handiwork,
   cheered with His own Presence--and yet we do not see Him! Indeed, there
   are some so blind as to assert that there is no Creator and that they
   cannot perceive any evidence that a supremely wise and mighty Creator
   exists!

   Oh, that the Lord Jesus would open the eyes of the willfully blind! Oh,
   that you, also, who are blinded by forgetful-ness rather than by error,
   may be made to cry with Hagar, "You, God, see me," and with Job, "Now
   my eyes see you"! If God will graciously convince men of His own Divine
   Presence, what a benediction it will be to them, especially to the
   young in commencing life! A clear perception that the Lord observes all
   that we do will be a very useful protection in the hour of temptation.
   When we remember the Divine eyes, we shall cry, like Joseph, "How can I
   do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" To see yourself is
   well, but to see God is better. Let us pray, "O Lord, open the young
   man's eyes, that he may see YOU!"

   When a man begins to see his great enemy, and his best Friend, we may
   next pray, Lord, open his eyes to see the way of salvation through the
   appointed Savior. There is no seeing the Lord Jesus but by His own
   light. We look to Him with a look which comes from Him. I have tried to
   explain salvation to people many times in simple words and figures, but
   there is a great deal more needed than an explanation. It is right to
   be very plain, but more is needed than a clear statement. No matter how
   bright the candle, a blind man sees none the better. I continually
   pray, "Lord, open my mouth," but I perceive that I must also pray,
   "Lord, open men's eyes!" Until God opens a man's eyes, he will not see
   what faith means, nor what atonement means, nor what regeneration
   means. That which is plain as a pikestaff to a seeing man is invisible
   to the blind. "Believe, and live"--what can be plainer? Yet no man
   understands it till God gives Grace to perceive His meaning.

   It is our duty, as preachers, to put the Gospel as plainly as possible,
   but we cannot give a man spiritual understanding. We declare, in
   baldest and boldest terms, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved," but men ask, like simpletons, "What do you mean?" We
   cry, "Look unto Jesus and live," but when our explanations are over, we
   learn that they have mistaken our meaning--and are still looking to
   themselves--and turning their backs on the Lord Jesus. To believe, or
   trust, is no mystery, but the simplest of all simplicities! And for
   that very reason men cannot be persuaded to think that we mean what we
   say, or that God means what He says. We need to pray--"Lord, open their
   eyes, that they may see, for seeing, they do not see, and hearing, they
   do not perceive!"

   Blessed be the Lord, how sweetly they do see it the moment their eyes
   are opened by His own Omnipotent touch! Then they are amazed that they
   did not see it before and call themselves fools for not perceiving what
   is so plain! Faith in the Lord Jesus is the simplest A B C of Divine
   Revelation--it belongs to the rudiments and elements of heavenly
   knowledge and we are dolts, indeed, not to take it as we find it in the
   Word of God and leave off mystifying ourselves over so plain a matter!
   Once let the miracle-working power of God open our eyes and we see well
   enough! But till then, we grope in the noonday for that which is right
   before us! I hope, beloved fellow-Christians, that you are praying
   while I am speaking. Praying, I mean, for those around you, and for all
   the blind souls that wander among the graves of earth-- "Lord, open
   their eyes, that they may see!" He that made the eyes can open them!
   Sin cannot so darken the mind but that God can pour light into it! If
   we cannot make men see, we can at least lead them to the Master
   Optometrist, who can rectify their sight.

   We should pray that our friends may have their eyes opened to see all
   manner of spiritual Truths of God. These optics of ours can only see
   natural objects. That is all they are intended for. We should be very
   grateful that our eyes can see as much as they see, but spiritual
   objects are not discernible by the eyes of the body, which are only for
   material objects. The things which pertain to the spiritual Kingdom
   must be perceived by eyes of a spiritual sort, eyes opened by the Lord!
   God must give to us spiritual senses before we can discern spiritual
   things--let this never be forgotten. There are those sitting among us
   who cannot discern spiritual things, for they have not the needed
   faculties. Carnal men and carnal women see only carnal things. The
   flesh cannot grasp, perceive, or discern the things of the Spirit. We
   must become spiritual and receive spiritual faculties before we can
   perceive spiritual things--in a word, we must be "born again." "The
   natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
   foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned." Therefore the need of the prayer, "Lord, open
   the eyes of the young man, that he may

   see!"

   Already the horses and chariots of fire were round about Elisha, but
   his servant could not see one of them because they were spiritual
   chariots and spiritual horses--angelic beings belonging to the purely
   spiritual domain--and as yet the youth had not entered the spiritual
   region and had no eyes with which to see into it. When God had given
   him spiritual eyes, then there began to break upon his vision that
   strange sight. Ethereal, airy--no, spiritual--but yet most real! That
   sight which revived his soul with the conviction that the Prophet was
   safe, was the ministers of God, as flames of fire, flashing to and fro
   and, like an army with horses and chariots, showing themselves strong
   for the defense of the servant of Jehovah. How surprised he was! How
   great his amazement! How content his mind! He and his master were
   mysteriously defended beyond all fear of danger.

   O my Hearers, as yet strangers to the things of God--if the Lord would
   open your eyes at once, you would be astonished, indeed, for as yet you
   have no idea, you cannot have any idea, what the spiritual life is, nor
   what spiritual realities must be--neither can you have any true idea of
   them till you are quickened of the Lord! You may talk about spiritual
   subjects and discuss them and think yourselves theologians--but you
   resemble deaf persons criticizing music--and blind men describing
   pictures! You are not qualified, even, to express an opinion upon the
   matter till you are created anew in Christ Jesus and brought within
   range of the spiritual and the heavenly. "Except a man be born again,
   he cannot see the Kingdom of God." Let the prayer go up, then, from all
   enlightened hearts, for those who are not as yet walking in the
   light--"Lord, open the eyes of the young men, that they may see!"

   We may expect a speedy answer! God hears prayer! Who knows but that
   many sitting in this house may be surprised by the secret touch of the
   invisible Spirit and all of a sudden may find themselves introduced
   into a new world? Elisha's prayer for this young man was not--and our
   prayer for others is not that they may do something which they can
   already do--that they may use some faculty which they already possess.
   No, our prayer is that a new sight may be granted to them--and that a
   new nature may be created within them, by a power altogether above and
   beyond themselves! We call on the hand of God! We ask the Lord to work
   a marvel! We would have you, dear Friends, receive what no education
   can ever get you, what no graduation at any university can ever bestow
   upon you! We want you to obtain what no years of experience or of study
   can achieve! We want you to possess what no imitation of other people
   will gain for you! We want you to experience a change which only the
   Lord, Himself, can work in you! We would have you pass from Nature's
   darkness into God's marvelous light--from an awful blindness into a
   clear vision of things otherwise invisible! Register that

   prayer before the Lord, you that are familiar with the courts of
   Heaven! Present the prayer for children, kinsfolk and friends. Cry,
   "Lord, let them receive sight, through the gracious working of Your
   Holy Spirit!"

   II. Secondly, let us set forth OUR REASON for praying such a prayer for
   those around us. On this occasion, I can truly say that I am praying
   much more than I am preaching. While I am standing here before you, I
   am also bowing low before the Lord, my God, and I am bearing upon my
   heart certain of you for whom I long in my heart and have great
   heaviness of spirit. I am praying, in the secret of my soul, "Lord,
   open his eyes, that he may see!"

   The first reason for our prayer is because we, ourselves, have been
   made to see. Had this miracle of Grace not taken place within us, we
   would have had no thought of prayer for you. But now our whole heart
   goes with the plea. Once we were as you are. Our eyes were blinded so
   that we saw neither our foes in all their terror, nor the Glory of the
   Lord round about us. Like blind Samsons, we went through the weary
   drudgery of earth surrounded by our foes. At last a glimmering of the
   Light of God fell upon us like a lightning flash, showing us our sin!
   And after we were thus illuminated we endured a great fight of
   afflictions. Without were fights, within were fears. Our enemies were
   around us and we knew not what to do! But some man of God prayed for us
   and one day our eyes were turned toward the hills from which comes all
   aid to terror-stricken men. The Lord was there, though we knew Him not!
   But, by His Grace, we looked to Him and were enlightened and our faces
   were not ashamed--for round about Him the mountain was full of chariots
   and horses of fire! "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
   of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."--

   "Lord, I was blind. I could not see

   In Your marred visage any Grace!

   But now the beauty of Your face

   In radiant vision dawns on me!" What else but such a heavenly vision
   could have scattered all our guilty fear? What else could have given us
   peace in the midst of tumult? We did not quite understand how it was
   done, nor did the change come to all of us in the same way, but we can
   all say, "One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see!" And
   since the prayers of others availed for us, we ought with double
   earnestness and hope to continue to plead for those who still have
   missed the glorious Revelation. "Lord, open the eyes of the young man,
   that he may see!"

   We call upon the Lord for this second reason, because only by His power
   can men be made to see. This we found in our own experience. In vain we
   struggled to behold the salvation of God. In vain we sought the help of
   godly people. No sight came to our souls, nor were the eyes of our
   understanding enlightened until the Lord, Himself, washed our eyes in
   the waters that go softly. Then we came seeing! And this we also
   discover when we try to lead others to the Light of God. We speak to
   them of the glories we, ourselves, behold, and set before them the
   Truth of God, but we cannot make them see. To bestow spiritual vision
   is as great a wonder as to make a world--and requires the same fiat of
   Omnipotence! Only He who created the eyes can give this second sight.
   "Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of
   one that was born blind." What folly, then, to attempt the greater task
   of bestowing the sight of the heart! How vain the boast of those who
   attempt to invade God's prerogative and imagine that human ordinances
   or observances can open blind eyes! Beloved, let us, after we have done
   our best to make the people see the Glory of the Gospel, always fall
   back on the God of the Gospel and entreat Him to do His own blessed
   work--

   "He comes, from thickest films of vice,

   To clear the mental ray;

   And on the eyeballs of the blind,

   To pour celestial day."

   Do not try to hold up your tallow candles to reveal the chariots of
   fire nor parade your vain philosophy, as if that could clear away the
   darkness of the soul. Leave room for God to work and, in a moment, at
   the touch of His finger, in response to the prayers of His people, the
   wondrous work shall be accomplished!

   Most importunately do we pray when we see the people enquiring. The
   cry, "What shall we do?" sends us to our knees, for we know that what
   is necessary is, not something to be done, but something to be seen.
   And we feel persuaded that the Lord who awoke the desire in the hearts
   of the seekers will surely, also, open their eyes to behold His Glory.
   The very fact that we feel drawn to pray for them is already a token to
   us that, before long, the scales shall fall from their eyes and through
   their vision of the splendor and sufficiency of the provision that God
   has made for those who trust in him,

   the name of the Lord will be greatly glorified. Therefore, with much
   expectancy, we again utter our prayer, "Lord, open their eyes, that
   they may see!"

   Another reason for this prayer is--you are not aware of your own
   blindness. You are trusting in yourselves that you can see all you need
   to see well enough. That young man, of whom I am now thinking, has no
   idea, whatever, that his eyes are stone blind to eternal things! He
   thinks himself a sharp and clever fellow and I do not deny that he is
   so, in his own line of things. I am glad that he has such quick
   faculties for this life. God bless him and may he prosper in his
   business and in the enterprise upon which he is just entering! May the
   good Lord be with him concerning the matter on which his heart is set!
   But still, dear Friend, I am rather afraid of your cleverness. I am
   somewhat frightened at that keenness of yours because I have seen sharp
   men cut themselves, and I have seen the self-reliant make miserable
   failures! Something is to be said for confidence in its proper place,
   but self-congratulation is a proof of inward weakness and forebodes a
   breakdown.

   If you are depending on an arm of flesh, at the very best you are
   resting on a broken reed! You require a strength beyond your own to
   fight the moral and spiritual battle of life. Your self-reliance, in
   this case, is a piece of groundless self-conceit. Do you not remember
   one of whom we read in this very Book of Kings that, when he was
   forewarned of what he would yet do, he exclaimed in astonishment, "Is
   your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Hazael could
   not think himself capable of such crimes--and yet he no sooner had the
   opportunity than he fell into the evil up to his neck! He was dog
   enough to be cruel, for he was dog enough to fawn upon himself! You do
   not believe, young man, that you will ever be dishonest, and yet that
   little gambling speculation of yours will lead to it. You cannot think
   that you will ever be godless--and yet you are even now departing from
   the good old ways of your home and making a jest of sacred things when
   in certain company! They that trust in themselves are storing up fuel
   for a great fire of sin! The pride which lifts itself up will throw
   itself down. Because the fine young fellow does not know how blind he
   is, we, therefore, lament his blindness and are the more earnest in
   bringing him to Jesus, that he may receive his sight. "Lord, open his
   eyes, that he may see!"

   Next, we pray this prayer because we have reason to fear that you are
   surrounded by those who will mislead you. We know the young man well.
   He has newly come to London from that sober, orderly, country home--and
   he has no notion of the snares which will be laid for him by fowlers,
   male and female. Oh, you who have no experience and little discretion,
   hear the voice of warning! Satan has cunning servants about him that
   hunt for the precious life with double diligence. Our Lord Jesus has
   about Him servants who too often slumber, but the devil's servants are
   not slothful in their dreadful business! You will find them waylay you
   in the streets and press around you in the haunts of pleasure. They are
   everywhere and they leave no stone unturned that they may entrap the
   unwary. And what if this blind young man is put down in the midst of
   all these bloodsuckers? They will devour him if they can--what if he is
   left to be their victim? It is like turning out a sheep among a pack of
   wolves! "Lord, open the eyes of the young man, that he may see!"

   We pray this prayer for some of you because you are going away from
   those who have watched over you and this is a dangerous change for you.
   Your mother--ah, we can never tell what a blessing a godly mother is to
   a young man--your mother parts from you with great anxiety. Will you
   ever forget her tender words? Our fathers are all very well--God bless
   them!--and a father's godly influence and earnest prayers are of untold
   value to his children. But the mothers are worth two of them, mostly,
   as to the moral training and religious bent of their sons and
   daughters! Well, I say, you are going right away from your mother's
   holy influence and from your father's restraining admonitions. You will
   now have nobody to encourage you in the right way. You will miss your
   sister's holy kiss and your grandmother's loving persuasions. You are
   going out of the hothouse into a night's frost -well may we pray
   concerning you, that you may carry with you well-opened eyes to see
   your way and look before you leap! The young man is now to walk
   alone--"Lord, open his eyes, that he may see!" If he does not look
   before he leaps, he will soon be in the ditch--and who shall pull him
   out?

   Again, we pray this prayer with the more pleasure because you will do
   so much good if your eyes are opened. A blind man in the midst of such
   a world as this, what can he do? He cannot help other travelers, for he
   has to seek aid for himself! You wish to give rather than to take, do
   you not? Some here have great abilities and I want them to use them
   aright. I am persuaded that I am speaking to young people whom God has
   ordained to be of great service to their age. That youth yonder does
   not as yet know what is in him. He is playing with himself. He is
   making a fool of himself! He is

   throwing his pearls before swine--he is wasting his strength. If the
   Lord should open his eyes, he would see what he is doing. What a man he
   would make if he were but right with God!

   Think of Saul of Tarsus, how he harassed the Church of Christ! But when
   the scales fell from his eyes, the Lord had no better servant under
   Heaven than that once-furious persecutor! With both hands he diligently
   built up the Church which once he labored to cast down. "The thing
   which has been is the thing which shall be." Pray, therefore, O my
   Brothers and Sisters, for our young men who have sinned, that they may
   be restored! And pray for those who are as yet ignorant, that they may
   be enlightened. The cause of God has need of these and in these the
   Church shall find her champions! Little know we the wealth of comfort
   for the faithful which may lie in one young life. Surely, we ought to
   pile on our prayers and make our intercession flame like some great
   beacon light for the rising youth of our time!

   There is yet another reason, fetched from the other side of the case.
   We should pray for the blinded one, since he may terribly sin if not
   soon made to see. How capable of doing mischief is a man blinded by
   ignorance, by passion, by ambition, or by any other form of sin! Who
   knows the capacities for evil that lie within a single soul? That once
   bright spirit, Satan, when he first thought of revolting against the
   God of Heaven, it was, perhaps, a single momentary flash of rebellious
   thought. But before long he had become proudly antagonistic to his
   Maker and the dragon had drawn down with his tail a third part of the
   stars of Heaven to quench them in the eternal night of endless
   wickedness! Then he came to this earth and polluted Paradise--and
   seduced our first parents from their happy innocence so that they
   became the progenitors of an unhappy race, steeped up to their lips in
   sin.

   That one first thought of sin, oh, how pregnant was it with innumerable
   evils! So, too, among ourselves. A boy, his mother's pride, to whom she
   looks forward as the honor of the family, may, for a while, appear to
   be everything that love can hope. But he falls into the hands of one of
   those tempters to unbelief who are so abundant in this great city. He
   is taught to pour ridicule upon his mother's piety and soon he casts
   off the bands of his father's God. He forgets the sanctity of God's
   Holy Day and forsakes the House of Prayer--and then he learns the way
   to the houses of strange women and to the palace of strong drink. And
   he plunges into one sin after another, till he is, himself, the leader
   of others down to the abyss! That boy who used to kneel at his mother's
   knee, say his childish prayers and then stand up and sing of Jesus and
   His love, was fondly regarded as one who would honor Jesus in his life.
   But look at him, now--he staggers home after midnight, vomiting oaths!
   He is foul both in soul and in body and those who love him best are
   saddest at the sight of him.

   Dear Friends, if we would not see our children or our friends running
   to this excess of riot and sinking in this superfluity of sin, let us,
   in agony of spirit, plead with God at once on their behalf! Oh, for an
   immediate entrance of the Light of God into their souls! Lord, open
   their eyes, that they may see! Lord, cause them to start back from the
   beginnings of sin, which are as the breaking out of the water floods! O
   Savior, quench in them the spark of evil before it grows into a fire
   and rages to a conflagration!

   III. I must now close by mentioning what OUR HOPE is about men when we
   pray this prayer for them, as I have been doing all along--"Lord, open
   the young man's eyes, that he may see!" What is our hope in reference
   to this? What will they see if the heavenly eye salve is applied?

   Elisha, no doubt, felt that the answer to his prayer would be precisely
   what it really was. "The Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he
   saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire
   round about Elisha." We want men's eyes to be opened, that they may
   know, first, that spiritual forces really exist. The things which we
   see are not the only real things, nor even the most real things. The
   things that are seen are temporal--they are, in truth, but shadows of
   the unseen! The substantial realities are not seen by these poor
   eyes--the substance is only perceived by our true selves. All that is
   visible is the mere shadow--the very image of the thing is out of
   sight. Faith teaches us to believe in the existence of that most
   glorious of all Spirits--the great God--in whom we live, move and have
   our being.

   Faith reveals to the heart the existence of that Divine and
   ever-adorable Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is at this hour with
   His Church, and will abide with her to the end of the world. Faith also
   makes us know the existence, power and Presence of the Holy Spirit who
   dwells with Believers and is in them, working out the eternal purpose
   of God in their sanctification. No knowledge is more sublime than to
   know the Trinity in Unity--Father, Son and Holy Spirit-- one Jehovah!
   When we come to realize that the Lord God is the source of all things,
   that the Lord has made us and not, we, ourselves--and that all things
   come into being by His sovereign will and power--then we come to
   recognize His

   Presence, to consult His will and to lean upon His might. God then
   becomes real in our thought and apprehension. Since He whom we cannot
   see, nevertheless supports all things that are, we feel that the
   invisible is the basis of all things!

   Oh, that we could get men's minds out of these time-worn ruts of things
   seen, these narrow bounds of space and time, and seeing, and handling!
   Oh, that they could rise into the region where the dim faculties, which
   are bounded by so small a circle, would give place to perceptions which
   know the infinite, the eternal, the true, the Divine! Oh, that the
   human mind, which was made in the image of God, could find itself at
   home with God, whose child it may become, by a second birth, of the
   living and incorruptible Seed, by the Word of God, which lives and
   abides forever!

   Verily, if our eyes are opened, we shall begin to recognize that God is
   greater than this world and all worlds! And then the mighty Truths of
   God which concern His way of mercy in Christ Jesus will ennoble the
   soul! Then shall we become true comrades of those bright messengers of
   God that fly to and fro, fulfilling the behests of the Most High. That
   there are devils, I think no Christian man will ever doubt, for at
   certain seasons we have been sadly conscious of a singularly terrible
   presence with which our souls have been in agonizing conflict. In that
   tearful battle, it has gone hard with us-- our armor has been battered,
   our comfort has been grievously wounded and our courage badly mauled.
   We have been saved as by the skin of our teeth. We hardly knew how to
   hold on at all, we were so sorely beset by unnatural temptations and
   suggestions nothing less than infernal!

   Then, at the Lord's rebuke, this great adversary has taken sudden
   flight and angels have come and ministered to us new joys and fruits of
   consolation fresh from the Tree of Life! Then have we enjoyed communion
   with unseen messengers of God who have seemed to bind up our wounds and
   bring us on our way and whisper peace. Did not an angel come to
   strengthen our Lord in Gethsemane? Have we not, in our measure, enjoyed
   a similar visitation? It is a grand thing to see the hosts of God
   attending us and to know that bright convoys of these shining ones will
   come to salute us at the last! It is a great gain to have our eyes
   opened, to see the Lord's goodness and mercy following us all the days
   of our life and ourselves, even here, dwelling in the house of the Lord
   forevermore! Open your eyes to spiritual things and at once you are
   encouraged! The present is grievous while you know only the visible,
   but the wilderness blossoms as the rose when you see the invisible!
   Project yourself beyond this narrow region and behold the Infinite--and
   sources of joy spring up around you everywhere! Poverty is forgotten in
   the midst of such riches--and even pain and disease have lost their
   sting.

   Elisha's young attendant, when his eyes were opened, saw, next, that
   God's people are safe. He perceived that there were more with Elisha,
   after all, than could possibly be against him, and he felt that he,
   himself, was safe as the servant of the servant of God. Thus he
   believed in his master's God and found a shelter from his own fears.
   The invaders were flesh and blood, but the defenders were of fire and
   thus were able to consume the adversaries at once. He saw, and saw it
   so joyfully, that God's horses of fire and chariots of fire were more
   than a match for all the forces of evil! I pray that the eyes of every
   Christian person here may be so opened that they shall never doubt that
   the powers on the side of Truth and righteousness and God are, after
   all, mightier than the hosts of evil.

   It may be that you live among those who scoff at your faith and despise
   all that you hold dear. Indeed, it seems that wherever you turn,
   everybody is against you in this day of doubt! I think I hear you cry,
   with David, "My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are
   set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
   and their tongue a sharp sword." Courage, my Comrade, God is near you!
   His angels are keeping watch and ward about you! We are not alone, for
   the Father is with us. Oh, that our eyes may be so opened as to see
   that more are they that are with us than all that are against us!
   Indeed, "if God is for us, who can be against us?" Let us be strangers
   to fear! In holy confidence, let us be "steadfast, unmovable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord." Never allow a doubt as to the
   ultimate issue. Is God, Himself, your shield and your exceeding great
   reward? Then, what can man do to you?

   Perhaps, within a month, some of you to whom I now speak, may be in so
   severe a fight that you will be almost driven to throw down your
   weapons in utter despair, saying, "How can I stand against so many?--I
   that am so feeble?" I beseech you, remember this warning! Have not I
   told you of it? I would plead with you to play the man! Gird up the
   loins of your mind. Be sober and hope to the end, for if the Lord has
   opened your eyes, you will perceive that you are on the winning side
   and that HE is coming soon who will smite His enemies upon the
   cheekbone. If you are on the side of God and of His Truth. If you do
   the right. If you believe in the Lord Jesus. If you commit yourself to
   the keeping of the hands which were pierced with the nails, Heaven and
   earth may pass away, but the Lord can never desert you! The skies may
   be rolled up like a shriveled parchment scroll and all the things that
   are seen may melt away like baseless fabrics of a vi-

   sion--earth and sea may vanish--but a believing soul must live, triumph
   and be exalted to a throne with Christ, for He has said, "Because I
   live, you shall live also." Hold fast your integrity! Believe the Truth
   of God even to the end, for the Lord Jesus will not fail, nor be
   discouraged, till all His foes are beneath His feet!

   If your eyes are opened, you will know that saints are honored by their
   Lord. Look! He dispatches His squadrons to be a bodyguard to one of
   them--would not you wish for such honors? See here the secret of the
   peace which abides with the man of God--as he has meat to eat that men
   know not of--so has he company that men cannot see! He lives like a
   prince in the center of a camp and sleeps securely. Faith makes the
   difference between the tranquil Prophet and his frightened boy. Oh,
   that you would believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and so enter into His
   peace! May this be the red-letter day in which your eyes shall be
   opened to see spiritual things and you shall begin to live a spiritual
   life! For this I have prayed. For this, let us all breathe, for a
   moment a silent prayer. (Here followed an interval of silence and then
   the preacher spoke in prayer), "Lord, I pray you, open the young man's
   eyes, that he may see: yes, Lord, open the eyes of all the blind among
   us, for Jesus' sake! Amen."

The Lad's Loaves in the Lord's Hands

   (No. 2216)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 9, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Jesus took the loaves." John 6:11.

   Look, there are the people! Five thousand of them, as hungry as
   hunters, and they all need to have food given to them, for they cannot,
   any of them, travel to buy it! And here is the provision! Five thin
   wafers--and those of barley, more fit for horses than for men--and two
   little anchovies, by way of a relish! Five thousand people and five
   little biscuits to feed them! The disproportion is enormous--if each
   one should have only the tiniest crumb, there would not be enough! In
   like manner, there are millions of people in London and only a handful
   of whole-hearted Christians earnestly desiring to see the city
   converted to Christ. There are more than a thousand millions of men in
   this round world and oh, so few missionaries breaking the Bread of Life
   to them! Almost as few for the millions, as were these five barley
   cakes for those five thousand!

   The problem is a very difficult one. The contrast between the supply
   and the demand would have struck us much more vividly if we had been
   there, in that crowd at Bethsaida, than it does sitting here, nearly
   1,900 years later, and merely hearing about it. But the Lord Jesus was
   equal to the emergency! None of the people went away without sharing in
   His bounty--they were all filled. Our blessed Master, now that He has
   ascended into the heavens, has more rather than less power! He is not
   baffled because of our need, but can even now use paltry means to
   accomplish His own glorious purposes. Therefore let no man's heart fail
   him. Do not despair of the evangelization of London, nor think it
   hopeless that the Gospel should be preached in all nations for a
   testimony unto them. Have faith in God, who is in Christ Jesus! Have
   faith in the compassion of the Great Mediator--He will not desert the
   people in their spiritual needs any more than He failed that hungry
   throng in their temporal need, long ago.

   We will now look at these biscuits and sardines, which seem to be truly
   an insufficient stock-in-trade to begin with--a very small capital,
   indeed, on which to conduct the business of feeding 5,000 persons. I
   shall say of these loaves and fishes, first, that they had a previous
   history before being mentioned in our text. Secondly, when we get to
   our text, we shall find these little things in a very grand
   position--"Jesus took the loaves" and, therefore, thirdly, they will
   have an after-history which is well worthy of being noted. When things
   get into Christ's hands, they are in the very focus of miracles!

   I. We will begin by saying that THESE LOAVES AND FISHES HAD A PREVIOUS
   HISTORY. Andrew said to Jesus, "There is a lad here, which has five
   barley loaves, and two small fishes."

   Notice, first, then, the Providence of God in bringing the lad there.
   We do not know his name. We are not told anything concerning his
   parentage. Was he a little peddler who thought that he could make some
   money by selling a few loaves and fishes and had he nearly sold out? Or
   was he a boy that the Apostles had employed to carry this slender
   provision for the use of Jesus and His friends? We do not know much
   about him, but he was the right boy in the right place that day! Be his
   name what it might, it did not matter--he had the barley loaves and
   fishes upon which the people were to be fed! Christ never is in need
   but He has somebody at hand to supply that need. Have faith in the
   Providence of God! What made the boy bring the loaves and fishes, I do
   not know. Boys often do unaccountable things, but bring the loaves and
   fishes he did. And God, who understands the ideas and motives of lads
   and takes account, even, of barley loaves and fishes, had appointed
   that boy to be there!

   Again I say, believe in the Providence of God! Mr. Stanley tells us
   that when he came out of that long journey of his through the forest, I
   think after 160 days of walking in darkness, and found himself at last
   where he could see the sun, he

   felt that there was a special Providence of God that had taken care of
   him. I am very glad that Mr. Stanley felt that it was the hand of God
   that had brought him out of the noisome shade, but I do not need to go
   to Africa to learn that we are beset behind and before by His goodness.
   Many of us have felt a special Providence of God in our own homes--we
   have met with His hands in connection with our own children. Yes, every
   day we are surrounded by tokens of His care. "Whoever is wise and will
   observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of
   the Lord." "I am sure God took care of me," said one, "for as I was
   going along a certain street, I slipped on a piece of orange peel and
   had what might have been a serious fall--yet I was not hurt in the
   least." To which his friend replied, "I am sure God has taken care of
   me, for I have walked along that street hundreds of times and have
   never slipped on a piece of orange peel, or on anything else." Full
   often God draws near to us in common life--

   "He comes to us all unaware, And makes us o wn His loving care."

   Let us also believe in His Providence with regard to the Church of
   Christ--He will never desert His people--He will find men when He needs
   them. Thus it has always been in the history of the saints and thus it
   shall always be! Before the Reformation there were many learned men who
   knew something of Christ's Gospel, but they said that it was a pity to
   make noise and so they communed with one another and with Christ very
   quietly. What was needed was some rough bull-headed follow who would
   blurt the Gospel out and upset the old state of things. Where could he
   be found? There was a monk named Luther who, while he was reading his
   Bible, suddenly stumbled on the doctrine of Justification by Faith-- he
   was the man! Yet when he went to a dear Brother in the Lord and told
   him how he felt, his friend said to him, "Go back to your cell and pray
   and commune with God, and hold your tongue."

   But then, you see, he had a tongue that he could not hold and that
   nobody else could, either! And he began to speak with it, the Truth of
   God that had made a new man of him! The God that made Luther knew what
   He was doing when He made him! He put within Luther a great burning
   fire that could not be restrained! And it burst forth and set the
   nations on a blaze. Never despair about Providence! There sits,
   tonight, somewhere in a chimney corner in the country, a man that will
   turn the current of unbelief and win back the churches to the old
   Gospel! God did never yet come to a point of distress as to His Truth
   but that suddenly one came forward--a David with a sling and a stone,
   or a Samson with a jawbone, or a Shamgar with an ox-goad--who put to
   rout the adversaries of the Lord! "There is a lad here." The Providence
   of God had sent him.

   Next, this lad with his loaves was brought into notice. When they were
   searching for all the provisions in the company, this obscure boy who
   never would have been heard of otherwise, was brought to the front
   because he had his little basket of biscuits. Andrew found him and he
   came and said to Jesus, "There is a lad here, which has five barley
   loaves, and two small fishes." So, rest assured, that if you have the
   Bread of Life about you and you are willing to serve God, you need not
   be afraid that obscurity will ever prevent your doing it. "Nobody knows
   me," says one. Well, it is not a very desirable thing that anybody
   should know you--those of us who are known to everybody would be very
   glad if we were not--there is no very great comfort in it. He that can
   work away for his Master, with nobody to see him but his Master, is the
   happiest of men. "I have only 100 people to preach to," said a country
   pastor to me. And I replied, "If you give a good account of those 100,
   you have quite enough to do." If all you have is very little--just that
   pennyworth of loaves and fishes--use that properly and you will do your
   Master service! And in due time, when God wants you, He knows where to
   find you!

   You need not put an advertisement in the paper--He knows the street you
   live on and the number on the door. You need not go and push yourself
   to the front--the Lord will bring you to the front when He wants you
   and I hope that you do not want to get there if He does not want you.
   Depend upon it, should you push forward when you are not required, He
   will put you back again! Oh, for Grace to work on unobserved, to have
   your one talent, your five loaves and two fishes and only to be noticed
   when the hour suggests the need, and the need makes a loud call for
   you! We have thus seen, first of all, the loaves and fishes in the
   desert, quite unnoticed, but put there by Providence--and we now behold
   them by that same Providence, thrust into prominence.

   When brought into notice, the loaves and fishes did not fare very
   well--they were judged insufficient for the purpose, for Andrew said,
   "What are they among so many?" The boy's candle seemed to be quite
   snuffed out! So small a stock-- what could be the use of that? Now, I
   dare say, that some of you have had Satan saying to you, "What is the
   use of your

   trying to do anything?" To you, dear mother, with a family of children,
   he has whispered, "You cannot serve God." He knows very well that, by
   sustaining Grace, you can, and he is afraid of how well you can serve
   God if you bring up those dear children in His fear. He says to the
   religious book salesman over yonder, "You have not much ability; what
   can you do?" Ah, dear Friend, he is afraid of what you can do and if
   you will only do what you can do, God will, by-and-by, help you to do
   what now you cannot do! But the devil is afraid of even the little that
   you can do now and many a child of God seems to side with Satan in
   despising the day of small things! "What are they among so many?" So
   few, so poor, so devoid of talent--what can any of us hope to do?
   Disdained, even by the disciples, it is small wonder if we are held in
   contempt by the world! The things that God will honor, man must first
   despise! You run the gauntlet of the derision of men and afterwards you
   come out to be used of God.

   Though seemingly inadequate to feed the multitude, these loaves and
   fishes would have been quite enough for the boy's supper, yet he
   appears to have been quite willing to part with them. The disciples
   would not have taken them from him by force--the Master would not have
   allowed it--the lad willingly gave them up to be the commencement of
   the great feast. Somebody might have said, "John, you know that you
   will soon be able to eat those five cakes and those two little fishes.
   Keep them--get away into a corner--every man for himself." Is it not a
   good rule, "Take care of number one"? Yes, but the boy whom God uses
   will not be selfish! Am I speaking to some young Christian to whom
   Satan says, "Make money, first, and serve God, by-and-by. Stick to
   business and get on! Then, after that, you can act like a Christian and
   give some money away," and so on?

   Let such a one remember the barley loaves and the fishes. If that lad
   had really wisely studied his own interests, instead of merely yielding
   with a generous impulse to the demand of Christ, he would have done
   exactly what he did, for if he had kept the loaves, he would have eaten
   them and that would have been the end of it. But now that he brings
   them to Christ, all those thousands of people are fed and he gets as
   much, himself, as he would have had if he had eaten his own stock. And
   then, in addition, he gets a share out of the 12 baskets full of
   fragments that remain. Anything that you take away from self and give
   to Christ is well invested--it will often bring in ten thousand per
   cent! The Lord knows how to give such a reward to an unselfish man,
   that he will feel that he that saves his life loses it, but he that is
   willing, even, to lose his life--and the bread that sustains it--is the
   man who, after all, gets truly saved!

   This, then, is the history of these loaves. They were sent there,
   through God's Providence, by a lad who was sought out and brought into
   notice. His stock-in-trade was despised, but he was willing to give it,
   whether it was despised or not. He would yield it to his Lord. Now, do
   you see what I am driving at? I want to get a hold of some of the lads
   and some young men and young women--I will not trouble about your age,
   you shall be lads if you are under seventy! I want to get hold of you
   who think that you have very little ability, and say to you, "Come, and
   bring it to Jesus." We need you! Times are hard. The people are
   famishing. Though nobody seems to need you, yet make bold to come out
   and who knows but that, like Queen Esther, you may have come to the
   Kingdom of God for such a time as this? God may have brought you where
   you are to make use of you for the converting of thousands! But you
   must first be converted yourself! Christ will not use you unless you
   are, first, His own. You must yield yourself up to Him and be saved by
   His precious blood and then, after that, come and yield up to Him all
   the little talent that you may have, and pray Him to make as much use
   of you as He did of the lad with the five barley cakes.

   II. But now I want to show you that THESE BARLEY CAKES GOT INTO A GRAND
   POSITION. The text says,

   "Jesus took the loaves." He took them into His own hands! From the
   trembling hands of the boy, or from his little basket, they were
   transferred to the blessed hands which one day would bear the
   nail-prints! This may teach us several lessons.

   First, they were now associated with Jesus Christ. Henceforth those
   loaves do not so much suggest the thought of the lad's sacrifice as of
   the Savior's power. Is it not a wonderful thing that Christ, the living
   God, should associate Himself with our feebleness, with our need of
   talent, with our ignorance, with our little faith? And yet He does so.
   If we are not associated with Him, we can do nothing. But when we come
   into living contact with Him, we can do all things! Those barley loaves
   in Christ's hands become pregnant with food for all the throng! Out of
   His hands they are nothing but barley cakes, but in His hands,
   associated with Him, they are in contact with Omnipotence! Have you
   that love the Lord Jesus Christ thought of this, of bringing all that
   you possess to Him, that it may be associated with Him?

   There is that brain of yours--it can be associated with the teachings
   of His Spirit. There is that heart of yours--it can be warmed with the
   love of God. There is that tongue of yours--it can be touched with the
   live coal from off the altar. There is that manhood of yours--it can be
   perfectly consecrated by association with Christ. Hear the tender
   command of the Lord, "Bring them here to Me," and your whole life will
   be transformed! I do not say that every man of common ability can rise
   to high ability by being associated with Christ through faith, but I do
   say this--that his ordinary ability, in association with Christ, will
   become sufficient for the occasion to which God, in Providence, has
   called Him. I know that you have been praying and saying, "I have not
   this, and I cannot do that." Stay not to number your
   deficiencies--bring what you have and let all that you are, body, soul,
   and spirit--be associated with Christ. Although He will not bestow upon
   you new faculties, the faculties you have will have new power, for they
   will come into a new condition towards Him and what may not be hoped
   for by association with such wisdom and might?

   But, further, they were transferred to Christ. A moment ago, they
   belonged to this lad, but now they belong to Christ. "Jesus took the
   loaves." He has taken possession of them--they are His property. Oh,
   Christian people, do you mean what you say when you declare that you
   have given yourselves to Christ? If you have made a full transfer,
   therein will lie great power for usefulness. But do not people often
   say, "If I might make some reserve"? "What is the meaning, then, of
   this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which
   I hear?" What about that odd thousand that you put in the funds the
   other day? What about the money saved up for a new bonnet? You
   sometimes sing--

   "Yet if I might make some reserve,

   And duty did not call,

   I love my God with zeal so great,

   That I should give Him all."

   Ah, well, when you have really yielded all, you may sing that again!
   But I am afraid that there are but few who can truly sing it. Oh, that
   we had more real putting of the loaves into Christ's hands! The time
   that you have not used for self, but given to Christ! The knowledge
   that you have not stored, as in a reservoir, but given to Christ! The
   ability that you have not wielded for the world, but yielded to
   Christ--your influence and position, your money and home, all put into
   Christ's hands and reckoned to be not your own, but to be His--this is
   the way in which London's needs will be met and the world's hunger will
   be satisfied! But we are staggered, at the very outset, by the lack of
   this complete dedication of everything to Christ.

   What is better, still, as these loaves were given to Jesus, so they
   were accepted by Jesus. They were not only dedicated, they were also
   consecrated! Jesus took the five barley loaves. Jesus took the two
   little fishes and, in doing so, He seemed to say, "These will do for
   Me." As the Revised Version has it, "Jesus therefore took the loaves."
   Was there any reason why He should? Yes, because they were brought to
   Him! They were willingly presented to Him! There was a need for them
   and He could work with them--"therefore"--He took the loaves. Children
   of God, if Christ has ever made use of you, you have often stood and
   wondered why the Lord could accept you. But there was a, "therefore,"
   in it. He saw that you were willing to win souls--He saw the souls
   needed winning and He used you--even you! Am I not now speaking to some
   who might be of great service if they yielded themselves to Christ, and
   Christ accepted them, and they became accepted in the Beloved? Only
   five barley cakes, but Jesus accepted them! Only two small fishes,
   brought by a little lad, but the great Christ accepted them and they
   became His own! Let us join one now in Heaven who on earth brought her
   all, and pray--

   "Oh, use me, Lord, use even me!

   Just as You wil, and when, and where.

   Until Your blessed face I see,

   Your rest, Your joy, Your glory share." But, what is better still,
   these loaves and fishes were blessed by Christ as He lifted up His eyes
   and gave thanks to the Father for them. Think of it! For five little
   cakes and two sprats, Christ gave thanks to the Father! Apparently a
   meager cause for praise, but Jesus knew what He could make of them and,
   therefore, gave thanks for what they would presently accomplish. "God
   loves us," says Augustine, "for what we are becoming." Christ gave
   thanks for these trifles because He saw into what they would grow! Do
   you not think that, having thanked the Father, He also thanked the boy?
   And in later years these words of gratitude would be ample recompense
   for such a tiny deed! Like the woman who cast in the two mites to the
   treasury, he gave his all, and doubtless was commended for the gift.

   Though high in Glory, today, Christ is still grateful when such
   offerings are made to Him. He still thanks His Father when, with timid
   trembling hands, we offer to Him our best, our all, however small! His
   heart is still gladdened when we bring Him our scanty store that it may
   be touched by His dear hands and blessed by His gracious lips! He loves
   us, not for what we are, but for what He will yet make us! He blesses
   our offerings, not for their worth, but because His power will yet make
   them worthy of His praise! May the Lord thus bless every talent that
   you have! May He bless your memory. May He bless your understanding.
   May He bless your voices. May He bless your hearts. May He bless your
   heads. May He bless you all and forevermore! When He puts a blessing
   into the little gift and into the little Grace that we have, good work
   begins and goes on to perfection.

   And when the loaves had been blessed, the next thing was, they were
   increased by Christ. Peter takes one, begins to break it, and as he
   breaks it, he has always as much in his hands as he started with!
   "Here, take a bit of fish, Friend," he says. He gives a whole fish to
   that man--he has a whole fish left! So he gives it to another, and
   another, and another, and goes on scattering the bread and scattering
   the fish everywhere, as quickly as he can! And when he is finished, he
   has his hands just as full of fish and as full of bread as ever! If you
   serve God, you will never run dry! He who gives you something to say
   one Sunday will give you something to say another Sunday! These 37
   years and more, I have ministered to this same Church and congregation,
   and every time that I have preached, I have said all that I knew. Some
   very learned Brothers are like the great wine vats of Heidelberg--they
   can hold so much wine that there is enough to swim in--but they put in
   a tap somewhere up at the top, so you never get much out. Mine is a
   very small barrel, indeed, but the tap is down as low as it can be--and
   you can get more liquid out of a small tub, if you empty it, than you
   can out of a big vat if you are only permitted to draw a little from
   the top.

   This boy gave all his loaves and all his fish--not much, truly--but
   Christ multiplied it. Be like he--give your all! Do not think of
   reserving some for another occasion. If you are a preacher, do not
   think of what you will preach about the next time--think of what you
   are going to preach about now. It is always quite enough to get one
   sermon at a time --you need not have a reserve, because if you get a
   lot piled away somewhere, there will be a stale odor about them! Even
   the manna that came down from Heaven bred worms and stank--so will your
   best sermons, even if the message is God-given. And if it does not come
   down from Heaven, but from your own brain, it will go bad still more
   quickly! Tell the people about Christ! Lead them to Jesus and do not
   trouble about what you will say next time, but wait till next time
   comes--and it shall be given you in the same hour what you shall speak.

   But, mark once more--when Jesus took the loaves, it was not only to
   multiply, but also to dispose of them. They were distributed by Christ.
   He did not believe in multiplication unless it was attended by
   division. Christ's additions mean subtraction--and Christ's
   subtractions mean additions. He gives that we may give away. He
   multiplied as soon as ever the disciples began to distribute--and when
   the distribution ended, the multiplication ended. Oh, for Grace to go
   on distributing! If you have received the Truth from Christ, proclaim
   it! God will whisper it in your ear and tell it in--but if you stop the
   telling out, if you cease the endeavor to bless others--it may be that
   God will no more bless you, nor grant you, again, the communion of His
   face.

   Putting all this together, if we all would bring our loaves and fishes
   to the Lord Jesus Christ, He would take them and make them wholly His
   own. Then, when He should have blessed them, He would multiply them and
   He would bid us distribute them--and we could yet meet the needs of
   London and the needs of the whole world even to the last man! A Christ
   who could feed 5,000 can feed five millions! There is no limit! When
   once you get a miracle, you may as well have a great one. Whenever I
   find the critics paring down miracles, it always seems to me to be very
   poor work, for if it is a miracle, it is a miracle--and if you are in
   for a penny, you may as well be in for a pound! If you can believe that
   Christ can feed fifty, then you can believe that He can feed five
   hundred, five thousand, five millions, five hundred millions, if so it
   pleases Him!

   Thus have I tried to stir up God's people to believe in the Lord and
   consecrate themselves to Him. But some of you are saying, "He is not
   preaching to me." No, I am not preaching to you, but I am preaching for
   you, for if God's people begin to be awakened, they will soon look
   after you. You will have somebody asking you about your soul before you
   get out of the Tabernacle! And during the week, if you meet some of
   them, they will be troubling you, rousing up your conscience and making
   you feel what an awful thing it is to be an enemy to God and to live
   without Christ! I hope that it will be so. Oh, you that do not love my
   Lord, what will become of you? Paul said that you would be Anathema
   Maranatha--

   cursed at His coming! I pray you, do not rest easy while that may be
   your portion! You are the people that we want to feed, you are the
   people whom we want to bless! Oh, that God, in His mercy, would but
   bless you! We do not ask to have the honor of it. We would be willing
   to have it quite unknown who it was that brought you to the Savior, so
   long as you did but come to Him. May the Lord in mercy bring you!

   III. But now, thirdly, and to conclude, THESE LOAVES AND FISHES HAD A
   LATER HISTORY. They got into

   Christ's hands. What was the result?

   First, a great deal of misery was removed by the lad's basket of barley
   cakes. Those poor people were famished. They had been with Christ all
   day and had had nothing to eat. And had they been dispersed as they
   were, tired and hungry, many of them would have fainted by the
   way--perhaps some would even have died. Oh, what would we give if we
   might but alleviate the misery of this world! I remember the Earl of
   Shaftesbury saying, "I should like to live longer. I cannot bear to go
   out of the world while there is so much misery in it." And you know how
   that dear saint of God laid himself out to look after the poor, the
   helpless and the needy all his days! Perhaps I speak to some who never
   woke up yet to the idea that if they were to bring their little all to
   Christ, He could make use of it in alleviating the misery of many a
   wounded conscience and that awful misery which will come upon men if
   they die unforgiven--and stand before the judgment bar of God without a
   Savior.

   Yes, young man, God can make you the spiritual father of many! As I
   look back upon my own history, little did I dream, when first I opened
   my mouth for Christ, in a very humble way, that I should have the honor
   of bringing thousands to Jesus. Blessed, blessed be His name! He has
   the Glory of it. But I cannot help thinking that there must be some
   other lad here, such a one as I was, whom He may call by His Grace to
   do service for Him. When I had a letter sent to me by the deacons of
   the church at New Park Street, to come up to London to preach, I sent
   it back by the next post, telling them that they had made a mistake,
   that I was a lad of 19 years of age, happy among a very poor and lowly
   people in Cambridgeshire who loved me, and that I did not imagine that
   they could mean that I was to preach in London! But they returned it to
   me and said that they knew all about it, and I must come. Ah, what a
   story it has been since then, of the goodness and loving kindness of
   the Lord!

   Now, perhaps, these words come to some Brother who has never yet laid
   hold of the idea that God can use him. You must not think that God
   picks out all the very choice and particularly fine persons. It is not
   so in the Bible--some of those who He took were very rough people. Even
   the first Apostles were mostly fishermen. Paul was an educated man, but
   he was like a lot out of the catalog--one bow out of due time--the rest
   of them were not so. But God used them and it still pleases God, by the
   base things and things that are not, to bring to nothing the things
   that are! I do not want you to think highly of yourself--your cakes are
   only five and they are barley--and poor barley at that. And your fish
   are very small and there are only two of them. I do not want you to
   think much of them, but think much of Christ! And believe that whoever
   you may be, if He thought it worth His while to buy you with His blood,
   and is willing to make some use of you, it is surely worth your while
   to come and bring yourself and all that you have to Him who is thus
   graciously ready to accept you! Put everything into His hands and let
   it be said of you, tonight, "And Jesus took the loaves." It is a part
   of the history of the loaves that they relieved a great mass of misery.

   And next, Jesus was glorified, for the people said, "He is a Prophet!"
   The miracle of the loaves carried them back to the wilderness and to
   the miracle of the manna. They remembered that Moses had said, "The
   Lord your God will raise up unto you a Prophet from the midst of you,
   of your Brethren, like unto me." For this Deliverer they longed and as
   the bread increased, so grew their wonder, until in the swelling cakes
   they saw the finger of God and said, "This is, of a truth, that Prophet
   that should come into the world." That little lad became, by his loaves
   and fishes, the revealer of Christ to all the multitude! And who can
   tell, if you give your loaves to Christ, whether thousands may not
   recognize Him as the Savior because of it? Christ is still known in the
   breaking of bread.

   But the people went further with reference to Christ, after they had
   been fed by the loaves and fishes--they concluded that He was a Prophet
   and they began whispering among themselves--"Let us make Him a king."
   Now, in a better sense than the text implies, I would to God that you
   and I, though humbly and feebly, might serve Christ till people said,
   "Christ is a Prophet. Let us make Him a King!" This sermon I offer my
   Master, if He will be pleased to accept it, though it is but a barley
   cake. And I pray that by it some may take Jesus Christ to be their
   King. Oh, that He had a throne in the hearts of many whom He shall feed
   at this time with the Bread of Heaven! Brothers and Sisters, I know
   that

   you wish to glorify Christ! Here is the way. Bring your loaves and
   fishes to Christ that He may use them in His Divine commissariat--and
   then He shall be magnified in the eyes of all the people!

   When the feast was finished, there were fragments to be gathered. This
   is a part of the history of the loaves--they were not lost. They were
   eaten, but they were there--people were filled with them, but yet there
   was more of them left than when the feast began! Each disciple had a
   basketful to carry back to his Master's feet. Give yourself to Christ
   and when you have used yourself for His Glory, you will be more able to
   serve Him than you are now! You shall find your little stock grow as
   you spend it! Remember Bunyan's picture of the man who had a roll of
   cloth. He unrolled it and he cut off so much for the poor. Then he
   unrolled it and cut off some more--and the more he cut it, the longer
   it grew! Upon which Bunyan remarks--

   "There was a man, and some did count him mad! The more he gave away,
   the more he had."

   It is certainly so with talent and ability and with Divine Grace in the
   heart. The more you use it, the more there is of it. It is often so
   with gold and silver--the store of the liberal man increases, while the
   miser grows poor. We have an old proverb, which is as true as it is
   suggestive--"Drawn wells have the sweetest waters." So, if you keep
   continually drawing on your mind, your thoughts will get sweeter. And
   if you continue to draw on His strength, your strength will get to be
   more mighty through God! The more you do, the more you may do, by the
   Grace of the Ever-Blessed One!

   Last of all, it came to pass that these loaves had a record made about
   them. There is many a loaf that has gone to a king's table and yet
   never been chronicled, but this boy's five cakes and two little fishes
   have got into the Bible--and if you look, you will find the barley
   cakes in Matthew; you will find the barley cakes in Mark; you will find
   the barley cakes in Luke! And you will find the barley cakes where we
   have found our text, in John. To make quite sure that we should never
   forget how much God can do with little things, this story is told four
   times over--and it is the only one of Christ's miracles which has such
   an abundant record!

   And now, as a practical issue, let us put it to the test. You young
   people who have lately joined the Church--do not be long before you try
   to do something for Christ! You that have, for a long time, been
   trusting Christ and have never yet begun to work, awaken yourselves to
   attempt some service for His sake! Aged friends and sick friends can
   still find something to do! Perhaps, at the last, it will be found that
   the persons whom we might have excused on account of illness, or
   weakness, or poverty, are the people who have done the most! That, at
   least, is my observation. I find that if there is a really good work
   done, it is usually done by an invalid, or by somebody who might very
   properly have said, "I pray you, have me excused." How is it that so
   many able-bodied and gifted Christians seem to be so slow in the
   Master's service? If there is a political meeting, something about
   Liberals and Conservatives, how earnest you are! You are all there,
   every bit of you, over your politics, which are not worth a penny a
   year!

   But when it comes to souls being saved, many of you are mute as fish!
   You go all the year round without caring even for the spiritual welfare
   of a little child! One of our friends gave a good answer to a Brother
   who said to him, "I have been a member of a Church, now, for 40 years.
   I am a father in Israel." He asked him, "How many children have you?
   How many have you brought to Christ?" "Well," the man said, "I do not
   know that I ever brought anybody to Christ." Upon which our friend
   retorted, "Call yourself a father in Israel and yet you have no
   children?! I think you had better wait until you have earned the
   title." So do I. It would be better that we had no professors of that
   sort, but that all our members, even were they much fewer, should be
   men and women constantly bringing forth fruit unto God in the
   conversion of others! The Lord set you all to work with this objective!

   I am almost done, but again I cannot help reminding those who are not
   Christ's, that while I have not directly preached to them, I have
   tried, by a side wind, to be preaching to them all the time! Either you
   are the Lord's, or you are not. If you are Christ's servant, take a
   sheet of paper and write down, "Lord, I bring my loaves and fishes to
   You." And if you are not Christ's, confess the awful truth to yourself
   and face it. I wish that you would make a record of it in black and
   white, putting down both name and date, "I am not Christ's." Take a
   good look at it! Try and grasp what it means, to withhold yourself from
   Him who loves you and waits to save you. Then ask yourself why you are
   not His. I remember a woman, not long ago, who said that at her work it
   came across her mind, "I am not saved." She was sweeping the room and
   when she finished that, she said to herself, "I have to cook dinner,
   but I am not saved."

   She went into the kitchen and had her fire all ready, and her food--but
   all the while she was putting things in the pot she kept saying to
   herself, "I am not saved." And so it was when she was busy all the
   afternoon and when her husband came home, she could not help blurting
   it out to him, "Oh, Husband, I am not saved!" But he was--and, by God's
   Grace, he pointed her to Christ! They knelt together, and oh, how he
   prayed with her! She found that which she so earnestly sought and it
   was not very many days before she could say, "Oh, Husband, by His Grace
   I am saved!" May that be the case with you! The Lord bless every one of
   you, wherever you may be! We shall all meet in the Day of Judgment. May
   you and I meet there without fear, to sing of the Sovereign Grace of
   God, which saved us from the wrath to come and helped us while we were
   here to bring our little, and put it into Christ's hands! The Lord be
   with you! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--John 6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Three Names High on the Muster Roll

   (No. 2217)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 16, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, O
   Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer you in this matter. If it
   is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning
   fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hands, O king. But if
   not, be it known unto you, O king, that we will not serve your gods,
   nor worship the golden image which you ha ve set up." Daniel 3:16-18.

   IF YOU read the second chapter of the Book of Daniel, you will think
   that Nebuchadnezzar was not far from the Kingdom of God. His dream had
   troubled him, but Daniel had explained it. Then the king made this
   confession to Daniel, "Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of
   gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could
   reveal this secret." He acknowledged that Jehovah, the God of the Jews,
   was the greatest of gods, and was a great interpreter of secrets, but
   in a short time we find this man setting up an idol and persecuting to
   the death those who would not worship it. He seems, indeed, to have
   turned the blessing into a curse, and made the image of his dream the
   pattern of the idol he set up for the nation to worship, thus making
   that through which God had graciously revealed His power and wisdom,
   the very instrument of his folly and vainglory.

   Man's proud heart is the same in all generations and the same thing
   happens even today. Have you not seen in your time men seriously
   impressed? They could not hold their own. They seemed stricken down by
   the force of the Truth of God and you felt almost sure that they would
   become, like Saul of Tarsus, true converts, and even Apostles of the
   faith. But after a while they forgot it, forgot it all, and became, at
   last, the most bitter and determined opponents of the Truth of God
   before which they seemed once to bow. Every minister who has a
   congregation of any considerable size must have met with such people. I
   remember one who, being at a Prayer Meeting where there was much
   wrestling power with God, was so overcome that he prayed aloud and
   seemed to cry with all his heart for mercy--and before he left, he said
   that he had found it. But the next day he declared that he would never
   go to such a meeting again--that he had been almost caught, but he
   would not trust himself in such society any more.

   And I fear that he never did, for he could always speak with great
   severity against the people who met for prayer and were earnest in the
   faith. We know, then, what to expect--that some who seem like fish
   almost landed, will, nevertheless, slip back into the stream--that it
   will happen unto them according to the true proverb, "The dog is turned
   to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in
   the mire." They will go out from us because they are not of us, and the
   last state of such men will be worse than the first.

   This great king of Babylon was an absolute monarch. His will was law.
   No man ever dared to dispute with him. Who would differ from a
   gentleman who could back up his arguments with a fiery furnace, or with
   a threat to cut you in pieces and to make your house a dunghill? And
   now, when it comes to this, that he sets up a god of his own, a huge
   colossal statue, and gathers all the princes and potentates of his
   world-wide dominion together to bow down before this image, it seems a
   strange thing to him that there should be anybody found who would not
   do so!

   And yet there were three Jews who mastered him! Once before they had
   broken the laws of his court and refused to eat unclean meat--and
   though they ate nothing but vegetables and water, "At the end of ten
   days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all
   the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat." Having
   stood firm for the right, before, they were the bolder to face the more
   terrible ordeal. The king himself had exalted them in the land and he
   expected them, of course, to do his bidding and set an example to
   others. But these three of the despised race of the

   Jews were unconquerable even by the master of the whole world! They
   stood out before Nebuchadnezzar and carried their point for God and for
   conscience.

   As we dwell upon this deed of noble heroism, may we become sharers in
   the courage and faith of these men whose names stand high on the roll
   of worthies in the Kingdom of God! Thirteen times their names recur in
   this chapter, like a refrain to the song which speaks of their deed of
   valor.

   Notice, first, the excuses they might have made. Secondly, the
   confidence they possessed. And thirdly, the determination at which they
   had arrived.

   I. First of all, as we think of these three brave Jews, let us consider
   THE EXCUSES THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE. They were accused by the Chaldeans
   who had so recently been saved from death by Daniel and his three
   friends. The surest way to be hated by some people is to place them
   under an obligation. "What favor have I ever done him, that he should
   hate me so?" said one. But in this case the wrath of man was to praise
   God. The incensed monarch called the offenders before him and, scarcely
   believing that in his realm any could have defied his authority, he put
   the alternative plainly before them. "Here is the golden image; you
   three Jews are to bow down before it. If you do not, there is the
   burning fiery furnace--and into that you shall be cast at once. What is
   your answer?"

   They might have said to themselves, "It is perfectly useless to resist.
   We cannot contend against this man. If we submit, we do it unwillingly
   and surely, being coerced into it, we shall be but little blamed. A man
   cannot be expected to knock his head against a brick wall, nor throw
   his life away and, therefore, we will bow our heads, as the rest of the
   multitude have done, and worship the image which Nebuchadnezzar the
   king has set up." It is a bad excuse, but it is one that I have often
   heard made. "Oh," says a man, "we must live, you know; we must live." I
   really do not see any necessity for it. We must die, but whether we
   must live or not, depends upon a great many things, and it is
   infinitely better to die than to sink your manhood and to violate your
   conscience at a tyrant's bidding!

   Again, they might have said, "We are in a strange land, and is it not
   written by one of our wise men, 'When you are in Babylon, you must do
   as Babylon does'? "Of course, if we were at home, in Judea, we would
   not think of such a thing. We would remember how God has said, 'You
   shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make unto you any
   graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in Heaven above, or
   that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
   you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them.' If we were at
   home, we would obey that Law of God, but we are many hundreds of miles
   away from Jerusalem, and surely we may be permitted to yield in this
   point." Thus have I known many who say they are Christians at home, act
   differently when they are abroad. They have not regarded the Sabbath,
   neither have they even regarded the decency or the indecency of the
   amusements to which they have betaken themselves, because, after all,
   they were not at home! "We would not do this in England, but we are in
   Paris, you see, and the case is altered," they say. Is the case
   altered? Is God the God of this island and not the God of the
   Continent? Has He ever given us permission to do abroad what we may not
   do at home? It is a vile excuse, but commonly enough made.

   They might also have said, "We are officers of the land," and seeing
   they were set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, they might
   have found some difficulty in detaching their private religion from
   their public duty. They were high officials! And what an excuse this is
   for a great deal of roguery and trickery everywhere! A man gets elected
   to a parish vestry, or a council, or a board--and when he once gets to
   sit on that board he seems to have left his honesty at home! I say not
   that it is always so, but I am sorry to say that it has often been so.
   The official has no sooner put on his robes of office than his
   conscience has vanished! But these men were not so foolish as to think
   that because they were made rulers in Babylon, they might, therefore,
   sin against the Most High God! It is true that they were bound to obey
   the lawful orders of their sovereign, but whether it is right to obey
   men rather than God, their conscience could easily enough judge. So
   they never made that excuse.

   But, then, they were prosperous men. They were getting on in the world
   and I believe that God sent this trial to Shadrach, Meshach and
   Abed-Nego because they were prospering. They might have said, "We must
   not throw away our chances." Among the dangers to Christian men, the
   greatest, perhaps, is accumulating wealth--the danger of prosperity!
   Wesley sometimes used to fear that Christianity was self-destructive,
   for when a man becomes a Christian, the blessings of this life are his,
   too. He begins to rise in the world. He leaves his old position behind
   him and, alas, too often, with increasing riches, forgets the God who
   gave him all! There is much truth in this idea and unless the Spirit of
   God

   abides with His people, we might, indeed, see our faith thus commit
   suicide! It is a danger to be guarded against, both by liberal giving
   and by frequent intercession!

   We often pray for Christians in adversity and it is right that we
   should do so, but it is even more necessary to pray for Christians in
   prosperity, for they run the risk of gradually becoming soft, like
   Hannibal's soldiers destroyed by Capuan holidays, who lost their valor
   in their luxury. Many a man who was an out-and-out Christian when he
   was lower down in life has, when prosperous, become much too great a
   gentleman to associate with those who were his honored Brothers and
   Sisters before. I have seen it scores of times and it is a shocking
   thing. May God grant that we may never turn His mercies into an excuse
   for sinning against Him! You who are rich have no more liberty to sin
   than if you were poor. You who rise in the world have no more right to
   do wrong than you had when you were down in the world and his lordship
   is no more honorable at a prizefight than the bullet-headed boxer! We
   must do right! We must never do wrong, or plead our position in
   society, or our prosperity in worldly things as a reason why we may do
   what others might not

   do!

   Again, further, they might have excused themselves thus. The putting up
   of this image was not altogether a religious act. It was symbolical.
   The image was intended to represent the power of Nebuchadnezzar and
   bowing before it was, therefore, doing political homage to the great
   king. Might they not safely do this? They might have said, "We are
   politically bound." Oh, how often we hear this brought up! You are told
   to regard the difference between right and wrong everywhere, except
   when you get into politics! Then stick to your party through thick and
   thin! Right and wrong vanish at once. Loyalty to your leader--that is
   the point! Never mind where he leads you, follow him blindly! You are
   even told that you may do wrong because it is politically right! I hate
   such an argument! These men never, for a moment, entertained that evil
   thought! It is true that politics were mixed up with this image, but
   whatever might be mixed up with it, they would not worship it, for God
   had said, "You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them,"
   and these sturdy Believers would do nothing of the kind under any
   pretense whatever.

   A very soothing salve for their conscience might have been found in the
   absence of any command to renounce their own religion. They might have
   encouraged each other to submit, by saying, "We are not called upon to
   deny our God." They need not believe the idol to be divine, nor confess
   the least faith in it--in their hearts they might make a mental
   reservation as they bowed--and they might have whispered to one another
   and said that it was a devil, and not God. They might have excused
   themselves to their own conscience by saying that they prostrated
   themselves to the music and not to the idol--or that they made
   obeisance to the king rather than to his image. In fact, if their
   consciences had been as elastic as some modern ones, though that was
   hardly possible, as the virtues of India rubber were scarcely known,
   then, they might have said that, in bowing down before the image, they
   were praying to Jehovah, since He might be worshipped anywhere and
   under any circumstances! They might have said that, although they
   looked at the image, they did not worship it. But beyond the glitter of
   its gold, their thoughts rose to the God of Glory. Anything, in fact,
   will serve for an excuse, when the heart is bent on compromise and,
   especially in these half-hearted days, it is very easy to find a
   specious reason for a false action if some temporal benefit is attached
   to it! Modern charity manufactures a multitude of excuses with which to
   cover sins.

   A stronger argument, however, might have been secured from the fact of
   the universal submission to the decree. "Everybody else is doing it,"
   they might have said. That morning, when the rising sun was saluted by
   the strains from those varied instruments of music from Persia, Greece
   and Babylon--when all the music of the world seemed gathered
   together--everybody bowed. There were Jews there, thousands of
   them--and they all bowed. There were fire worshippers there--men who
   hated the worship of graven images--but they all bowed. There were men
   there who had gods of their own which they reverenced--but they all
   bowed before Nebuchadnezzar's god. "What a singular being you must be
   to stand out against the fashion of the time!" the tempter might have
   said. "Your own countrymen have bowed and you will not--better men than
   you, let me tell you, have bowed, but you will not!"

   No, they will not, these three singularities, these strange
   eccentricities! It is folly to be singular except when to be singular
   is to be right! And to be eccentric is not commendable unless the
   eccentricity consists in not being concentric with any kind of evil
   way! In spite of all the apostate crowds, these brave men would not
   yield--not they! Though millions bowed, what had that to do with them?
   My dear Hearers, I ask you to cultivate a brave personality. In the
   service of

   God, things cannot go by the counting of heads. You must follow the
   Lord's will wherever it leads you, whether you go alone or not--

   "Dare to be a Daniel, Dare to stand alone."

   They might have said, "It is only for once, and not for long. Ten
   minutes or so, once in a lifetime, to please the king-- such a trivial
   act cannot make any difference. At any rate, it is not enough to brave
   the fiery furnace for. Let us treat the whole thing as a huge jest. It
   would be ridiculous to throw away our lives for such a trifle." Have
   you never heard such arguments in these days? This indulgent 19th
   Century has plenty of easy maxims of a very similar sort. In the
   supreme hour many fail because the trial is seemingly so small. They
   mean to stand for God, but this is scarcely the right time! They will
   wait and choose a more worthy occasion, when something really heroic
   can be attempted. Were they to stand for such a little thing, the world
   would laugh with derision at such a straining out of a gnat! So Adam
   eats the apple, Esau the pottage and the one temptation, unresisted,
   issues in life-long loss! Not even for a few minutes in a lifetime
   would these three brave men deny their God. May their stubborn faith be
   ours!

   Another excuse that they might have made was, "We can do more good by
   living than we can by being cast into that furnace. It is true, if we
   are burned alive, we bear a rapid testimony to the faith of God, but if
   we live, how much more we might accomplish! You see, we three are Jews,
   and we are put in high office--and there are many poor Jews who are
   captives. We can help them. We have already done so. We have always
   seen justice done to God's people, our fellow countrymen, and we feel
   that we are raised to our high office on purpose to do good. Now, you
   see, if you make us bigots and will not let us yield, you cut short our
   opportunities of usefulness."

   Ah, my dear Brothers and Sisters, there are many that are deceived by
   this method of reasoning! They remain where their conscience tells them
   they ought not to be, because, they say, they are more useful than they
   would be if they went "outside the camp." This is doing evil that good
   may come and can never be tolerated by an enlightened conscience! If an
   act of sin would increase my usefulness tenfold, I have no right to do
   it! And if an act of righteousness would appear likely to destroy all
   my apparent usefulness, I am to do it! It is yours and mine to do the
   right, though the heavens fall--and follow the command of Christ
   whatever the consequences may be. "That is strong meat," do you say? Be
   strong men, then, and feed on it.

   But they might also have said, "Really, this is more than can be
   expected of us. If we had been asked to contribute our tithe to the
   support of the religion of Jehovah, we would cheerfully do so, but to
   yield our lives in this horrible way, to be cast into a burning fiery
   furnace is more than flesh and blood can bear!" Yes, and some of us
   could not answer that argument, for, perhaps, it is pressing upon
   ourselves. Remember what Jesus said to the multitudes who went with
   Him, "If any man come to Me and hate not his father, and mother, and
   wife, and children, and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life,
   also, he cannot be My disciple. And whoever does not bear his cross and
   come after Me, cannot be My disciple." We must stand to a full
   surrender and say, "Let it cost what it may, I make no exception. I
   take all risks. I will follow Christ, the Lamb, wherever He goes, even
   should I die while I am following Him!" He that does not come to that
   has not taken the position which Christ demands of us--and which His
   Holy Spirit must work in us before we are fully converted to the faith.
   "Strong language again," says one. God make you strong enough to apply
   it to yourself!

   Thus I have set before you the excuses that these three Jews, Shadrach,
   Meshach, and Abed-Nego, might have made.

   II. In the second place, let us assure our own hearts by admiring THE
   CONFIDENCE WHICH THEY POSSESSED. They expressed it very emphatically
   and clearly. They had a very definite, solid, foursquare faith.

   First, they said, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer you
   in this matter." The word, "careful," there, does not give you the
   meaning. Read it, "We are not full of care as to how to answer you."
   They did answer very carefully, but they were not anxious about the
   answer. It was not a thing that troubled them in the least. They knew
   what they were going to say. They did not deliberate. They did not
   hesitate. They said, "Nebuchadnezzar, we can answer you at once on that
   point." They were so calm, so self-collected, that they could talk to
   him, not as a king, but as Nebuchadnezzar. When it came to life-work,
   it was man to man, and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego to
   Nebuchadnezzar--and they told him that they had no difficulty in
   answering him.

   In the second place, they did not judge it theirs to answer at all. I
   find that it may be read, as in the Revised Version, "O Nebuchadnezzar,
   we have no need to answer you in this matter," meaning, "We will not
   answer you. It is not for us

   to answer you. You have brought another Person into the quarrel." Let
   me read the words that precede my text. Nebuchadnezzar said to them,
   "Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?" In effect,
   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego replied, "It is not for us to answer
   you. There is Another that will do that. You have challenged God and
   God shall make His own reply." It was bravely spoken. They threw the
   onus of this matter upon God, Himself! So may you. If you will do
   right, it is God's affair to see you through. You have nothing to do
   with the consequences, except patiently to bear them--the consequences
   must be with God. Only you do right. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
   and obey Him and keep the command of the Most High, and then whatever
   comes of it, it is no fault of yours. That must be left with God.

   Then notice what they say. "Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us
   from the burning fiery furnace." They avowed their faith in the
   Omnipotent God, knowing that if He chose, no mighty man of Babylon
   could ever throw them into that furnace. The furnace itself must die
   down and become cool as ice if God so wills it. They tell the tyrant to
   his face, enveloped as he was in the flame of his wrath, that God can
   save them out of the fire. Their God was almighty and they put their
   trust in Him.

   What is more, they add, "And He will deliver us out of your hands, O
   king." Whether they burned in the fire or not, they were sure they
   would be delivered. "If we die, we shall be out of your reach, but we
   may not die. We may live beyond your reach! You have asked the
   question, 'Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?' and
   we answer you, 'Our God will deliver us out of your hands, O king.'"

   Now, Beloved Friends, if any of you are in great difficulty and
   trouble, tempted to do wrong, no, pressed to do it, and if you do what
   is right, it looks as if you will be great losers and great
   sufferers--believe this--God can deliver you! He can prevent your
   having to suffer what you suppose you may and if He does not prevent
   that, He can help you to bear it and, in a short time, He can turn all
   your losses into gains, all your sufferings into happiness! He can make
   the worst thing that can happen to you to be the very best thing that
   ever happened to you! If you are serving God, you are serving an
   Omnipotent Being, and that Omnipotent Being will not leave you in the
   time of difficulty, but He will come to your rescue! Many of us can say
   with Paul, "We trust not in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead:
   who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we
   trust that He will yet deliver us."

   The Lord has helped us in the past, He is helping us in the present and
   we believe that He will help us all the way through. He will help you,
   too, if you just follow His Word and, by a simple faith, do the right
   thing. I believe that we have reason to expect interpositions of
   Providence to help us when we are called to suffer for Christ's sake.

   III. But here is the point that I want to make most prominent--the
   third one--THE DETERMINATION AT WHICH THEY ARRIVED. "If not," if God
   does not deliver us at all, "be it known unto you, O king, that we will
   not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set
   up." Grand language! Noble resolve! "If not, if we have to go into the
   fire, into the fire we will go, but we will never bow the knee to an
   idol." So these gracious Jews were enabled to say!

   They did not base their loyalty to God upon their deliverance. They did
   not say, as some do, "I will serve God if it pays me to do so. I will
   serve God if He helps me at such and such a time." No, they would serve
   Him for nothing! Theirs was not cupboard love. "If not, if He does not
   deliver us, if it is His will that we should be burned alive, we
   surrender ourselves to His will, but we will not break His Divine
   command, or make idolaters of ourselves by bowing before an image which
   has no life in it, which could not even set itself up, but which
   Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up."

   They resolved that they would obey God at all costs. Now, I knew a
   young man, once, to whom a certain ordinance of Christ was made known
   as being Scriptural, but as far as he could see, if he followed that
   ordinance, every door would be shut against him. If he was bold to do
   as he thought he ought to do, according to his Master's command and
   example, it would be the ruin of everything! Well, he did it, and it
   was not the ruin of anything--and if he had to do such a thing again a
   hundred times over, he thanks God that he would do it. There is such
   sweetness in having to make some sacrifice for God. There is such a
   heavenly recompense, that one almost envies the martyrs! Rather than
   pity their sufferings, one feels an intense longing that such honor had
   been ours and that we had had the moral courage and holy stamina to
   suffer for God even as they suffered. Who among the bright ones are the
   brightest in the land of light? They that wear the ruby crown of
   martyrdom most certainly lead the van, for they suffered, even to the
   death, for their Lord. O Friends, it is a

   glorious thing when we make no calculation of costs, but with our whole
   heart and soul follow the Lamb wherever He leads us!

   Let us walk in this heroic path. But some will say, "It is too hard.
   You cannot expect men to love God well enough to die for Him." No, but
   there was One who loved us well enough to die for us, and to die a
   thousand deaths in one, that He might save us. If Christ so loved us,
   we ought so to love Him. "Well," says one, "I think it is impossible. I
   could not bear pain." It is possible, for many have endured it! I
   remember that one of the martyrs who was to be burned on the following
   morning, thought that he would test himself--and there being a large
   stove in the cell, he put his foot into it to see whether he could bear
   to have it burnt--and soon shrank back. Therein he was foolish, for
   when he went out the next morning to stand on the firewood and burn, he
   stood like a man and burnt bravely to the death for his Master! The
   fact was, his Lord did not call him to burn his foot in the stove, and
   so He did not help him to bear it. But when He called him to give his
   whole body to the flames, then Divine Grace was given.

   There is a story of a martyred woman who had a child born to her a few
   days before she was burnt and, being in great pain, she cried aloud.
   One said to her, "If you cannot bear this, what will you do when you
   come to burn?" She said, "Now you see the pains of nature which befall
   a woman and I have not patience enough to bear them. But by-and-by you
   shall see Christ in His members suffering and you shall see what
   patience He will have, and what patience He will give to me." It is
   recorded of her that she seemed as if she had no pain at all when she
   yielded herself up to Christ. Do not judge, by what you are, today,
   what you would do if you were called into trouble! Divine Grace would
   be given to you. I have no doubt that many of the most timid of those
   who truly love the Lord would be the very bravest--while some who think
   they would be brave would be the very first to start back. You may
   never be called to such a trial as that, but still, if you cannot bear
   the small trials, how would you bear the great ones?

   "I cannot bear to be laughed at," says one. But though there is
   something cruel about mocking, it does not break anybody's bones. And
   being laughed at--well, really, I have sometimes thought, when I have
   seen a good joke cracked over my poor head, that there is so much
   misery in the world that if I might be the cause of making a little
   more mirth, I should be glad. And even if it is told against me, if it
   made somebody feel a little merrier, it was not a matter for great
   sorrow. And then you go into the workshop and they point at you and
   say, "There comes a canting Methodist!" Remember, that is the way in
   which the world pays homage to Christianity! If there is anything
   genuine in the Christian religion, the world pays its respect by
   laughing at it and caricaturing it. Accept their compliments, not as
   they intend them, but as you choose to read them, and you will not be
   grieved.

   You, Shadrach, not afraid of a burning fiery furnace, are surely not
   going to be frightened by the laughter of a silly boy or girl in the
   workshop! Alas, this unworthy fear enters into all relationships! I
   have known men afraid of their wives! I have known fewer wives,
   however, afraid of their husbands, for they are generally bold for
   Christ and can suffer for His name's sake. I have known children afraid
   of their parents and some poor parents, six feet high, afraid of their
   children! Oh, what poor worms it makes of us when we begin to be afraid
   of our fellow creatures! Do right and fear noth-ing--and God will help
   you.

   To enable us to get the spirit of these three holy men, we must get,
   first, a clear sense of the Divine Presence. If a man feels that God is
   watching him, he will not bow his knee to an idol. Neither will he do
   evil, for God's eye is upon him. He will endure, "as seeing Him who is
   invisible." And though the floods of ungodly men lift themselves up, he
   will remember the Lord who sits upon the floodwaters and is higher than
   they. The man who realizes God's Presence is, by that invisible
   Companionship, rendered invincible! Greater is He that is for him, than
   all that can be against him--

   "For right is right, since God is God,

   And right the day must win.

   To doubt would be disloyalty,

   To falter would be sin."

   We must, next, have a deep sense of the Divine Law. I have already
   reminded you of the Law of God, "You shall have no other gods before
   Me. You shall not make unto you any graven image, or any likeness of
   anything that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
   that is in the water under the earth: you shall not bow down yourself
   to them, nor serve them." No Virgin Mary, no cross, no crucifix, no
   picture, no image, no visible object is to be regarded with reverence
   or worshipped instead of God. All this must be put away! That is clear
   enough and, therefore, Shadrach, Me-

   shach, and Abed-Nego, feeling that God was near and knowing what God's
   Law was, dared not violate that Law of God, but would sooner die.

   Above all, to keep us right, we must have a mighty sense of the Divine
   love. We shall never obey God till, by His Grace, we have new hearts
   and those hearts are full of love to Him through Jesus Christ. Then, if
   you love Him, you will say, "What? Put an image of gold in His place?
   Never! Join the multitude in worshipping a colossal statue instead of
   the invisible Jehovah? Never!" With holy indignation you will choose
   the furnace of fire rather than have that purer flame which glows in
   your heart quenched, or made to burn dimly.

   To some of you this must seem very trifling because, you say, "I do not
   care about religious forms and ceremonies. Let me enjoy myself while I
   am here--that is all I ask." Well, you have made your bargain and a
   sorry one it is! If this life is all, how ought a man to live? I am
   sure I cannot tell you. Perhaps the wisest thing of all is, "Let us eat
   and drink, for tomorrow we die." But there is another world and a life
   beyond! And it is sometimes incomparably wise to fling this life away
   that we may win the life eternal! Our Lord often reminded His hearers
   of this great Truth, "He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that
   hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."

   "But what did these three men do?" asks one. "They simply did not bow
   their heads and they were cast into the fiery furnace. What did they
   do?" They influenced their age, their people and all time. These three
   men influenced the city of Babylon and the whole Babylonian empire!
   They certainly influenced King Nebuchadnezzar. They influenced the next
   age and, to this hour, the influence of their brave stand for God in
   His eternal Unity and for the non-worship of any visible thing has held
   the Hebrew race firmly to this one point! It was principally through
   these three men that the whole Jewish people were taught their deep
   hatred of everything like idol-worship. And they were, by such men as
   these, and some who followed after, weaned from their tendency to
   wander after idols--and tethered fast to the worship of Jehovah, the
   one living and true God. Would God that the Jews as a nation went
   further and knew our Lord Jesus Christ!

   Still, it is something that they are yet alive upon the earth bearing
   witness that there is but one God, Creator of Heaven and earth, who
   only is to be worshipped. More than that, the influence of these three
   men lives in this audience and will live in thousands of audiences in
   days to come. Does it not make your pulse race? Does it not make your
   heart leap within you? Have you not said to yourselves, "This is a
   noble example"? Oh, that we may rise to it! In an age like ours, when
   everything is sold, when you can buy anybody, when the flute, harp,
   sackbut, dulcimer and all kinds of music carry everything before them,
   when a mask and a visor will infatuate even a saint--it is time that
   there were some men of the stern old mold of these three Jews who could
   not and would not, yield--whatever might happen. The pillars of the
   earth might be dissolved, but these men would still stand upright and
   bear the whole world upon their shoulders by the grand power of God
   that made them strong.

   These three men command the admiration of Heaven and earth. A fool
   would have pointed at them and said, "There go three fools--gentlemen
   high in office, with large incomes and wives and families. They have
   only to take their cap off and they may live in their wealth! But if
   they do not, they are to be burnt alive and they will not do it! They
   will be burnt alive. They are fools!" Yes, but the Son of God did not
   think so. When He, in Heaven, heard them speak thus to King
   Nebuchadnezzar, He said, "Brave, brave men! I will leave the Throne of
   God in Heaven to go and stand by their side." And invisibly He
   descended, till where the fires were glowing like one vast ruby, where
   the fierce flame had slain the men that threw the three confessors into
   the burning fiery furnace, HE came and stood! And there they walked! It
   was the greatest walk that they had ever had! On those burning coals
   the four of them were walking together in sweet fellowship! They had
   won the admiration and the sympathy of the Son of God who left Heaven,
   itself, that He might come and stand side by side with them!

   It was, therefore, comparatively a little thing that they won the
   admiration of Nebuchadnezzar. That proud imperial tyrant cried to those
   about him, "Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the
   fire?" They answered, "True, O King." And he, with his visage white
   with ghostly fear, said, "Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
   midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is
   like the Son of God." He himself could not but stand there and,
   awestruck, admire these three heroes! And today you do the same. These
   three men still live! From the glowing coals their voices call aloud to
   us, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might."

   To close--if we would be servants of God, we must be Believers in His
   Son, Jesus Christ. Come and trust Jesus Christ and you are saved! When
   you are truly saved, you are to be saved from all hesitation about
   obedience to God--so saved,

   that from now on God's Law is your rule. Then, with that holy Law
   imperative upon you, you will go forth into the world and say, "It is
   not mine to ask what others will do. It is not mine to shape my course
   by them, not mine to enquire what will bring me most profit, what will
   bring me most honor. It is mine to look up to You, my God, and ask,
   'What would You have Me to do? By Your Grace, I will do it at all
   costs.'"

   I wonder how many young men to whom these words are addressed have
   pluck enough in them to come out on Christ's side? I believe that many
   young men do not want an easy life. They would rather have a hard time
   and a stern battle. We still have brave spirits among us who like to
   lead the forlorn hope and are not afraid. I challenge such to come and
   serve my Master fully and thoroughly! They shall have a rough time of
   it, but they shall have glory, honor and immortality as their reward.
   Make a whole burnt offering of yourself, my Brothers and Sisters--body,
   soul and spirit--for Christ! These three young men "yielded their
   bodies," as we read in the 28th verse. "I beseech you, by the mercies
   of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
   acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." Let the faith
   of your spirit carry your whole body with it in hearty obedience to
   God's command, and let this be true of you--

   "In full and glad surrender,

   I give myself to You.

   Yours utterly and only

   And evermore to be.

   OSon of God You love me,

   I will be Yours alone!

   And all I have, and am, Lord,

   Shall henceforth be Your own." But I fear that I speak in vain to many
   who will turn away and say, "This world is for me." Well, if you make a
   choice of this world and of ease and pleasure for yourself, then you
   have chosen Egypt's treasures and you have disdained the reproach of
   Christ--and you shall find, one day, how dreadful a folly you have
   committed! God grant that you may find it out soon and not in the world
   to come! God bless you and save you, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Daniel 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

"Is the Spirit of the Lord Straitened?"

   (No. 2218)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 23, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 26, 1891.

   "O you that are named the house of Jacob, is the Spirit of the Lord
   straitened?" Micah 2:7.

   THERE may be some who think they can convert the world by philosophy;
   that they can renew the heart by eloquence; or that, by some witchcraft
   of ceremonies, they can regenerate the soul. But we depend wholly and
   simply and only on the Spirit of God! He, alone, works all our works in
   us and, in going forth to our holy service, we take with us no strength
   and we rely upon no power except that of the Spirit of the Most High.
   When Asher's foot was dipped in oil, no wonder he left a footprint
   wherever he went! But if his foot had not first been anointed, there
   would have been small trace of him and, unless we have the unction of
   the Holy One, and are endued with power from on high, in vain shall we
   seek to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted,
   or to proclaim the opening of the prison to them that are bound!

   We need the Holy Spirit to prepare us for our work. He first gives the
   desire to go forth to the field of service and only He can equip us for
   the fight. "The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
   tongue, is from the Lord." Let us seek, then, to be charged with the
   Holy Spirit--to receive to the fullest the Divine influence--and go to
   our labor thus amply prepared. There is no preparation for the work of
   God like being with God! Go up into the solitude with Christ and then,
   when He calls you, you will be fit to go forth for Him and tell what
   you have seen with Him in the Holy Mount.

   When we get at the work, our need remains. We long to see the people
   saved, but in order to that, they must be born again and this we
   cannot, ourselves, accomplish. Change a stone into flesh? Try that at
   home with a piece of stone on your table before you attempt it with the
   hard hearts of men! Create a soul between the ribs of death? Try that
   in a morgue before you pretend to create within a sinner, dead in sin,
   the spiritual life! Of regeneration we may say, "This is the finger of
   God." If our religion is not supernatural, it is a delusion! If the
   Holy Spirit is not with you, you are like Jannes and Jambres,
   attempting to work a miracle without Jehovah's aid--and you will be
   baffled and detected for an impostor. You will fail, like the seven
   sons of one Sceva, a Jew, who tried to cast out devils. The devils do
   not know you--they know Jesus and they know the Holy Spirit--but at
   your idle efforts they mockingly laugh! Only those people who never do
   any spiritual work talk about what they can accomplish. When you get
   into the sacred service, you find how great your weakness is! You feel
   out of your depth when you come to deal with souls and you must have
   the Holy Spirit or fail!

   We must not conclude that because so many good people give their time
   to God's work, that necessarily the work is done. No, there is nothing
   done unless the Holy Spirit does it. We never personally go a step
   towards Heaven and we never lead another one inch in the way apart from
   the Holy Spirit! We must have the Holy Spirit and if we have Him not,
   all our machinery will stand still, or if it goes on, it will produce
   no effect whatever. I heard of a Christian man whose mill wheel was
   noticed to be in motion on a certain Sunday. The people going to
   worship greatly wondered about it, but one who went by set their minds
   at rest by pointing out that the wheel was only turning idly round
   because the water, by accident, was allowed to flow over it. And the
   man said, "It is very much like our minister and his sermons. There is
   no work being done, but the wheel goes round--clickety click, clickety
   click--though it is not grinding anything." It also greatly resembles
   many an organization for spiritual service--the water is passing over
   it, glittering as it flows--but the

   outside motion does not join on to any human need, nor produce any
   practical result--and nothing comes of the click and hum--

   "Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,

   With all Your quickening powers," or else all our service for the Lord
   is in vain.

   I. The text asks this question, "Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?"
   As we try and dwell upon it a little while, we remark, first, that THE
   SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS NOT STRAITENED BY THE COMMANDS OF MEN, for in a
   previous verse we find that the people said to their Prophets,
   "Prophesy you not." When men spoke in the name of God, these people had
   grown so besotted, through their evil doings, that they bade them hold
   their tongues! They did not want to hear any more about God. They had
   given Him up and they wished to have no more to do with Him! What was
   said by the Prophets was unpleasant. It provoked unhappy memories. It
   made them think of things that they would rather forget. So they said
   to the Prophets, "Prophesy you not."

   And here comes the question of the text. These men speak under the
   impulse of the Spirit of God. What do you think? Is the Spirit of the
   Lord to be straitened, shut up, put down, silenced by the commands of
   men? They thought so! They thought that they had only to say to these
   men of God, "Be quiet. If you speak again, we will put you in prison,
   or we will banish you, or we will cut off your heads." By those means
   they thought to stifle the voice of the Spirit of God and make Him dumb
   in their midst! The question comes, "Have you done it? Can you do it?
   Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?"

   Beloved Friends, this can never be! The Spirit of God is not
   straitened, for any man in whom He dwells must speak. They may tell Him
   to be quiet and He may even, for a season, consent to be so. But one of
   old said, "His Word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my
   bones, and I was weary with forbearing"--and he was obliged to speak
   out. If a man has made a message of his own, or if he has borrowed it
   from another, he may or may not speak it. But if God has given it to
   him to speak, speak it he must, and nothing can silence him! Throughout
   long ages men have felt moved of God to speak and they have had to
   speak in peril of their lives, but they have spoken all the same. When
   the light of the Reformation first came to England, those who received
   the Gospel were mostly very feeble folk. They felt the force of the
   movement and thought that it must have come from God, but they were not
   sure of their standing ground and the major part of them recanted when
   they were brought in presence of the fire, or even laid in prison.

   Some of the best of them, during the early days of Henry the Eighth,
   having but a slight hold of the Truth of God, drew back, and the enemy
   thought that they would all be of this kind. And so he hunted and
   persecuted them. But, after a very little time, the very men who had
   been cowards when first they learned the Truth, were pricked in their
   conscience and they came forward, saying that they found it to be more
   unbearable to live after having recanted than they could find it to
   die--and in the power of God they stood up boldly to declare Christ!
   There was little Bilney, of whom Latimer speaks so lovingly--a man
   grandly taught in many things, but at first a trembler. He thought that
   he might be mistaken and so he drew back. But afterwards he gave
   himself up to die. And when opportunities were given to him to escape,
   he would not embrace them. He felt that he must die for his Master!

   And there was Frith, who, when they brought him through Croydon and he
   was desired by the Archbishop of Canterbury (I mean Cranmer, who was in
   an almost similar spiritual state, himself, but then, by force of his
   position compelled to be a persecutor) to escape into the woods--the
   north wood or Norwood and elsewhere--made the notable reply, "The
   moment that you let me alone, I will go up to Lambeth myself. I am to
   die for Christ and if you make me fly away for a time, I will be back
   again, for I must acknowledge my Master." The persecutors began to be
   surprised at this, but the reason was that the men grew surer of the
   Truth of God and, as they grew surer of it, they grew bolder to confess
   it--and confess it they must when once they felt the power of it in
   their souls! God will not leave Himself without a witness, be you sure
   of this, and if there should come a time of trembling, when even the
   brave hearts seem staggered and begin to fail, there will again come a
   time of confidence when men will step out and say, "I was a coward
   once, but now, in the name of the Most High, I will avow His cause and
   stand up for the faith once for all delivered to the saints." The
   Spirit of the Lord is not straitened by the commands of men. He will
   make His servants speak!

   Know, again, that if some of these servants are put to death, or
   silenced, the Spirit of the Lord is not straitened, for He will raise
   up others. He is never at a loss. They burned Huss, whose name was
   Goose, but he said that God would raise

   up a swan, a bigger bird than he! And that was Luther's motto, his
   coat-of-arms--and they could never roast the swan, though they would
   have liked to have done so. Luther lived on, for God wanted such a
   witness as he and as long as God needed him, the hate of his enemies
   was vain! Thus it has been in all ages. Where did God find many of His
   first witnesses in the Reformation? In the places where you would have
   thought it least likely that there should have been any to bear
   testimony for Him--in the monasteries! He laid His hand on priests,
   monks and nuns--and He said to these, "Go and preach the Gospel of
   Christ" and they did it, and did it faithfully, even to the death. They
   fell before their persecutors, the Romanists, like mowed grass in the
   month of June--one swathe of martyrs, and then another, and then
   another-- but though their enemies reaped on, they never reaped that
   field clean, for by the time they had got to one end, it was all green
   grass, up to their ankles again, at the other end!

   God made men who could bear witness to His Word to grow faster than
   they could kill them! And so He will while the world stands. The Spirit
   of the Lord is not straitened. If the whole Church of God were to
   apostatize--and I should not be surprised if almost the entire visible
   Church were to do so, seeing that it has, to a great extent, done so
   already-- it would make no difference whatever to the eternal purposes
   of God. Outside the professing church He would soon find His own people
   and soon build up for Himself a truer and better Church that would not
   be as the past, but would hold fast by the Gospel of the Grace of God
   with the energy and simplicity of faith. Therefore, fear not, but
   answer this question with confidence and say, "The Spirit of the Lord
   is not straitened."

   But if those who believe in God's name should die and if no more were
   raised up, the Spirit of our Lord would not, even then, be
   straitened--He could find other ways of reaching men's minds. He could
   still speak by the Bible. Give us an open Bible and we shall never be
   in the dark. And He can speak by many a holy book that in the present
   evil age is despised. There are many good books, like the saints of
   old, wandering about in sheepskins and goatskins--old Puritans,
   "destitute, afflicted, tormented," that will yet bear witness for
   Christ! Just remember how Guthrie's, "Saving Testimony," long forgotten
   in Scotland, was found by a shepherd lad, taken to a minister and
   read--and how there broke out, from the reading of that old book that
   had well-near gone out of date and notice--a blessed revival of
   evangelical religion!

   And if all books were gone, the Spirit of God could act directly upon
   the hearts of men. He is not straitened! He can still call some Saul of
   Tarsus without a Bible and without a minister. And if the enemies of
   the Lord were so to conquer that the very name of Christian should be
   forgotten--still the Spirit of God could begin again and, out of
   nothing, "create a new Heaven and a new earth wherein dwells
   righteousness." Despair? What have we who know the might of God to do
   with despair? What have we to do, even, with doubt or fear? The Lord
   lives and His eternal Spirit will work His Divine purposes without
   fail.

   II. Our second remark is equally emphatic. THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS
   NOT STRAITENED BY ANY CONCEIVABLE CAUSE--if not by the commands of men,
   certainly not by any other cause.

   The Spirit of the Lord is not straitened by any change in Himself The
   Holy Spirit, as very God of very God, might truly say of Himself, "I am
   the Lord, I change not." He is today what He was at Pentecost, what He
   always was from that beginning which had no beginning. He is Divine,
   Omnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent, All-Wise, Infinite. He does as He
   wills. Therefore He is not straitened. He is not straitened by the
   spirit of the age, whatever that may be. I have heard a good deal about
   it and I believe that "the spirit of the age" is Satan. That is short
   and not very sweet--but that is the only spirit of the age that I know
   of. Ages have followed ages, but there has never been but one "Prince
   of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of
   disobedience." He has appeared in different forms--the spirit of
   ignorance, the spirit of intolerance, the spirit of superstition, the
   spirit of envy, the spirit of infidelity, the spirit of speculation.
   All these work one and the same spirit, dividing unto his disciples
   severally as he wills. And though the spirit of evil is mighty, he must
   fly before the Spirit of God, who is infinitely more powerful and who
   is not to be hindered, hampered or straitened by the spirit of the age!

   Certainly the Spirit of God is not to be straitened by the discoveries
   of science. Last night, I think, they found out something very new.
   They will probably be finding out something new tonight. With reference
   to my faith in Christ, it does not make the slightest difference what
   is discovered, nor should any true revelation of science unsettle any
   preacher of the Gospel. The more that is known of God's works, the
   better! The more they are understood and rightly explained, the better!
   Let the Father's Words be magnified. But the Gospel that God's servants
   were bound to preach when our

   forefathers were in the utmost ignorance, is the same Gospel that we
   are bound to preach now, amid the dazzling electric light. If we had
   gone into the catacombs of Rome, illuminated by a few flickering lamps,
   we should have had nothing to preach down there but Jesus Christ and
   Him crucified!

   And when we come together, now, in this enlightened 19th Century, we
   have still no other subject but Christ crucified, "the old, old story
   of Jesus and His love." Modern discoveries need not make us tremble,
   for that the Spirit of God is not straitened by science is proved by
   the fact that the most scientific men have been subdued by His power.
   He is as able to convert the learned as the unlearned. He has often
   done it and we have had those who have seemed to know all about the
   earth and the heavens, too, who yet were little children at the feet of
   Christ. Where the Spirit of God comes, He is not straitened in that
   way.

   Neither is He straitened by the worldliness of the great masses in the
   midst of whom we live. As we look round about on the people, we are
   almost broken-hearted about them and seem to think the world was never
   so hard as it is now--and that men were never so indifferent, never so
   wrapped up with worldly gain as they are now. Oh, yes they were! It is
   only another phase of the same evil. "The whole world lies in
   wickedness," just where it has always lain. There is the same sin, the
   same hardness of heart, the same blindness, the same callousness--and
   the Word of God is as much able to work here in London as in old pagan
   Rome! It is as able to subdue our cities in England as it was to subdue
   Athens and Corinth and the other cities where Paul preached it. Let us
   have confidence that nothing about the people today--their poverty,
   their love of drink, their search after pleasure, their indifference,
   or anything else--has at all affected the power of the Holy Spirit over
   the minds of men!

   And the Spirit of the Lord is not straitened, even, by the skill of His
   enemies. Certainly they are now skillful beyond anything we have ever
   read of! We have those who pretend to preach the Gospel but, all the
   while, they are trying to stab it. They appear to give it a kiss, but
   they smite it under the fifth rib. Many, nowadays, claim to be
   evangelical, when they know that the very essence of the evangelical
   system is abhorrent to them. But the Holy Spirit is not straitened
   today, any more than when He met the sophistries of the Greek
   philosophers and overthrew them all! The simple Truth of God will win
   its way. The fog may darken and become so thick that a man cannot see
   his hand, but the Holy Spirit knows the road and He can see through the
   darkest midnight that the Church of God will ever have to endure! And
   He will bring out the righteousness and Truth of the Gospel as the
   light--and the glory thereof as a lamp that burns. He is not straitened
   by the skill of His enemies.

   I do not know how to express all that I feel about this, but this I do
   know--that I cannot imagine anything that can really diminish the power
   of the Holy Spirit. If He is Divine, He is Omnipotent and, if
   Omnipotent, nothing can lay hands on Him to bind Him as the Philistines
   bound Samson. He would burst their bands asunder! He is the free Spirit
   of God and no power can hold Him--

   "When He makes bare His arm, What shall His work withstand?" III. But
   now I come to a very practical part of my subject, which is this--THE
   SPIRIT OF THE LORD MUST

   NOT BE TREATED BY US AS THOUGH HE WERE STRAITENED. How can we do this?
   In many ways. I mention

   nine.

   If we act towards Him as if His holy Word would not, now, convert and
   sanctify, comfort and conquer, as it used to do, we are, in this, in a
   horrible position of practical unbelief! His holy Book, in days gone
   by, did great wonders. It was like Goliath's sword, of which David
   said, "There is none like that; give it to me." It was double-edged and
   even he that played with it might wound himself to spiritual death.
   Many have wrested the Word to their own destruction. "But surely the
   Word has not, now, the same power?" Try it! Give the Bible to the
   wicked, to the careless and the thoughtless. Read it to them. Induce
   them to read it and see if it does not still convert! When you are in
   great trouble, turn to the Book and pray the Holy Spirit to bless it,
   and see if it does not comfort you! In your darkest hour you shall find
   light in it! When you are ready to give up in despair, you shall be
   strengthened and return to your labor with hope, if you do but search
   it and believe its message. It is full of consolation.

   Never think that the Spirit cannot bless the Word to you, as He used to
   do. He is not straitened. When you hear and do not profit, it is your
   hearing that is wrong, not His power that has failed. When you read the
   Bible and have not that enjoyment you once had, be sure that it is your
   own fault. The meat is as rich--you have lost your appetite. The Spirit
   of

   God is not straitened! There is as much Inspiration in this Book as
   when it was first penned. It is still Inspired and he that reads it
   aright still feels its inspiring influence, as God comes into his heart
   through His own Word. The Spirit of God in the Book and through the
   Book, is not straitened. Let us keep to it. Let us preach it more and
   more. Let us take care that our sermons are made out of the Bible, not
   out of our own heads! Then, speaking God's Word, we shall see that the
   Spirit of God is not straitened.

   We behave as if the Spirit of God were straitened, in the next place,
   if we conceive the present state of things to be hopeless. If you are
   ready to fold your arms and say that nothing can be done, is the Spirit
   of the Lord straitened? The church to which you belong may be cold and
   dead and the ministry powerless, but is the Spirit of the Lord
   straitened? Your own works seem to have no good results following from
   them and though you plod on, the service has become almost a monotony
   to you. But is the Spirit of the Lord straitened? Perhaps I address
   some man, so far ungodly that he has no hope of salvation, yet still is
   anxious to be saved. Perhaps he says, "How can I ever become a
   Christian? How can I have a new heart and a right spirit?" Is the
   Spirit of the Lord straitened? Cannot He give you the tenderness you
   desire? Cannot He give you the desire that seems to be lacking? Cannot
   He give you faith in Christ at this very moment? Cannot He breathe into
   you, right now, that breath of spiritual life that shall make you a
   living soul, looking up to the Cross and finding life in the Crucified?

   I pray, dear Friend, if you are under a horrible sense of sin--if you
   think yourself the worst wretch that ever poisoned the air and if you
   feel unfit to live as well as unfit to die--yet believe that the Holy
   Spirit can renew you and can turn the sinner into a saint and make you
   to glorify God even now, this instant! If not, you limit the power of
   the Holy Spirit and I come to you with this question, "Is the Spirit of
   the Lord straitened?" The case is desperate if it were not for the
   Divine hand. It is beyond all hope if there were no God. There is no
   balm in Gilead--there is no physician there--if there had been, the
   health of the daughter of my people would long ago have been recovered.
   Where, then, is the balm? Look upward for it! Where is the physician?
   Look upward for Him! There is the Christ of God, "mighty to save," and
   there is the living Father Himself, and there is the almighty Spirit!
   Oh, that you would no longer be filled with suspicions as to the power
   of God! With God all things are possible. "Is anything too hard for the
   Lord?" Is the Lord's arm waxed short? Trust that He can do all things
   and do all things for you whether you are a saint or a sinner! I shall
   have to come again to you with the question, "Is the Spirit of the Lord
   straitened?"

   Do you not think, again, that we very much act as if the Spirit of the
   Lord were straitened when we only look for little blessings? I am very
   glad to see 300 to 400 persons in a year converted and added to this
   Church and this has long been the case. But if I ever imbibed the idea
   that this were all that might be done, I would be straitening the
   Spirit of God! If you have had a number of conversions in the Sunday
   school--and I thank God that you have and you have never been without
   them--yet if you conceive that you have reached the maximum of success,
   I must come to you with this question, "Is the Spirit of the Lord
   straitened?" Dear Friends, there is no reason that I know of why the
   sermon that brings one sinner into the Light of God, should not bring a
   thousand into the Light, supposing a thousand sinners to be hearing it!
   The same power which saves one is precisely that power that would save
   a thousand--

   "The very Law which molds a tear,

   And bids it trickle from its source--

   That power preserves the earth a sphere

   And guides the planets in their course." The same Law, the same Power
   operates to little and to gigantic ends. Oh, for a mighty belief in
   that God who "is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask
   or think, according to the power that works in us"--and that Power is
   the Holy Spirit who cannot be straitened!

   Why, then, should we not come up to the House of God with the prayer,
   "O Lord, work mighty marvels"? Is He not the God that does great
   wonders? Should we not expect Him to do large things? I know some will
   say, "Well, if I were to see a great many converted, I would be afraid
   that they would, many of them, go back." But my experience tells me
   that there is no reason to believe that when many are converted there
   are more mistaken persons in the number, in proportion, than when few
   are converted. In fact, I think that I have noticed that the more that
   are received into the Church, the better is the quality. And the reason
   is this--that, when few are coming, there is a strong temptation to
   accept them with less discretion. But, when there are a great many, we
   can afford to be somewhat more rigid so that the more the merrier, and
   the more the sounder! I think that it is often the case. Let us believe
   that the Spirit of God can save a parish, can save

   a city, can shake London from end to end! Oh, that God would enlarge
   the capacity of our faith! "According to your faith be it unto you."
   But we have not more than sixpenny-worth of faith and when we get as
   much as that represents, we think that we are getting rich! And yet
   there are mines of untold wealth of the Grace of God to be had. Oh,
   that we had the faith with which to take possession of them!

   Again, dear Friends, do you not think that we also treat the Spirit of
   God as though He were straitened when we imagine that our weakness
   hinders His working by us? "Oh," says one, "I have no doubt that God
   can bless a great many by you!" Well, dear Fiend, if you knew what I am
   often obliged to feel of myself, you would never talk so. I am the
   weakest of you all, in my own apprehension. Another says, "I know that
   I am inferior in ability, in knowledge, in opportunity." Just so, dear
   Friend, and, therefore, you suppose that the Spirit of God cannot use
   you? Do you not see that though you think such a confession is an
   evidence of humility, you are straitening the Spirit of God? However
   weak and feeble you may be, He can use you! If you think that He
   cannot, you deprive Him of power in your apprehension. It is not
   yourself, you see, that you are lowering, you are really lowering the
   power of God! He can use a person who is very insignificant, very
   obscure, very unlearned, very feeble. No, He delights to do this, and
   He makes even those that are strong feel weak before He uses them, so
   that they say, "When I am weak, then am I strong." He will use empty
   vessels and if you do not need emptying because you are already empty,
   then that is one little thing that needs not be done and God can begin
   with you at once! There is nothing in you--nothing! Now, if God will
   use you, He will manifestly have all the Glory. Believe that He can use
   you--and get to work and do something! Proclaim His Gospel! Tell it
   over and over again. Tell it where you have told it, or where you have
   never told it, and believe that God can use you--AND HE WILL!
   Otherwise, if you say, "He cannot use me," I shall put the question to
   you again, "Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?"

   But I hear another say, "I think, dear Sir, you do not know where I
   live. If you did, you would not think there could be any very great
   blessing." Where do you live? In No-Man's-Ground? At the other end of
   the world? At Land's End, just over the edge of the universe? Here is a
   word for the little places, little Churches, hamlets with scanty
   population, where only a few people come together for worship. Do not
   believe that the Spirit of the Lord is narrowed by the small-ness of
   the place. Some of the greatest works for Christ have begun in hamlets
   and in small villages. The fire has commenced to burn there which has
   afterwards become a mighty conflagration, like the flames which are
   driven in terrible grandeur across the forests of America. It matters
   not how few begin, but where two or three are met together in Christ's
   name there He is! And if He is there, He will soon, by means of that
   little company, be somewhere else, and He will make the fire to fly
   abroad to the utmost ends of the earth! If you have only two or three
   souls committed to your charge, you have quite as many as you will give
   good account of. Do not hunger for big congregations--hunger to save
   those you have! If the Lord will but bless you to the Sunday school
   class, or to the two or three children in your own family, you cannot
   tell what good will come of it, for the Spirit of the Lord is not
   straitened by the scantiness of the population!

   A great many persons are guilty of thinking the Spirit of God to be
   straitened when they fancy that He must always work in one way. When I
   am seeing persons who come forward to confess their faith, I find they
   often begin by telling me how they were brought low under a sense of
   sin--and I like that old-fashioned way of conversion. But when I find
   one beginning by saying, "The Lord met me and filled my heart with joy
   and gladness under a sense of pardon, almost before I had any sense of
   sin, and the sense of sin followed after," I say to myself, "Let the
   Lord do His work in His own way." I am not going to make a pattern and
   lay them all on it and say that they must all be just that length, or
   else be stretched out a bit, or be cut shorter. No! Let the Lord save
   His own people in His own way! And if one is made to go down to the
   dark dungeon of law-work and gets whipped till he has not a bit of
   whole skin in his soul, I hope that it will do him good. But if another
   is gently led to Christ and does not know that there is a rod, but
   through love and kindness is led to rejoice in his Savior, I trust that
   he will remember it, and be glad all his days. Conversions are not run
   into molds. You cannot get a gross of conversions like a gross of steel
   pens. Each living child is different from any other living child. A
   great painter never paints exactly the same picture twice. There is
   always a difference, somewhere, be it ever so slight. And when there is
   a work for eternity done in a Church, it is done in very varied ways.
   If we begin to tie the Lord down to one way of work, we shall make a
   great mistake.

   "Oh," says one, "we meet together, a number of us, and anybody speaks
   who likes--and that is God's way of working. I do not believe in a
   one-man ministry." But we are in great danger of grieving the Spirit of
   God if we think that He

   only works with one set of men, with one order of government, or with
   only those who have none. Another man, who goes to hear one particular
   individual, says, "I am profited by Mr. So-and-So's preaching and do
   not get so much good under anybody else. I do not like that other open
   way of worship." Brethren, let them worship as they like! God blesses a
   one-man ministry and God blesses a twenty-man ministry. If the ministry
   is in the power of His Spirit, let it take what shape it likes. God is
   not bound by our rules and regulations--if you see God at work, bless
   His name that He is there and let Him work as He wills. You must not
   think that God works only on one set of lines. "Oh," says one, "I
   always get a blessing from So-and-So." Yes, you expect it, and you pray
   God to send it. "But I do not expect a blessing from such-and-such a
   man. He has such a curious way of going to work." Very likely. God has
   some very strange servants and, may I add, He has some very strange
   children!

   We have strange families, ourselves, sometimes. Some parents have very
   old boys and a number of God's sons and daughters are the oddest
   children that ever were born. Yet He bears with them and surely we may
   bear with them, too. Some of the most useful people one has ever known
   have also been very eccentric and have gone their own way to work. If
   you do not like their way, do not go with them--go your own way. They
   will not like your way, but they must not blame you, neither must you
   despise them. As the Lord directs you and as you find the Word of God
   guides you, set to work for Him and believe that the Spirit of the Lord
   is not straitened! God blessed William Huntington, the coal-heaver, to
   many souls, though he preached a very strong Calvinism, while, at the
   same time, He was blessing some who preached a very weak
   Arminianism--but God blesses neither the Calvinism nor the
   Arminianism--but the Christ that is in the sermon! The true, eternal,
   evangelical Truth of God that is brought out, God Himself will bless to
   the souls of men! Let us not, therefore, speak of the Holy Spirit as
   tied to any set of men. "Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?"

   Once more--we act as if we did not believe in this Divine Truth
   concerning the Spirit of God when we think that some men are beyond His
   reach. Let us never imagine that those who have been sitting under the
   sound of the Word for years are so Gospel-hardened as to be past
   hope--or those who have gone deep into sin are too deeply-dyed ever to
   be cleansed--or those who have wandered from the fold are too far away
   ever to be recalled! Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened, that we
   should despair of any whom God has permitted to remain on this side of
   His judgement bar? Have faith for the worst of men and the worst of
   women, too--great sinners, when saved, bring great Glory to that God
   whose Spirit leads them to the Truth.

   And again, we may treat the Spirit of God as straitened if we cannot
   believe that He can bless us today. "I feel so gloomy," you say. "I
   hope that I shall be better tomorrow." Brother, why should you not be
   converted at this good hour? "Oh," says some sister, "I mean to serve
   the Lord when I got a little older." Do you? Well, you are a little
   older since I began to speak to you, and I think that your best time to
   begin is now. Believe in God's nows. Believe that any moment is a good
   moment with God. "This day is a day of good tidings." Why should not I,
   at this moment, dedicate myself afresh to God? Why should I not come to
   Christ, again, and ask Him to give me more life, more faith, more hope,
   more joy, more likeness to Himself now? "Is the Spirit of the Lord
   straitened?"

   IV. On the fourth and last point, our words must be few, though the
   Truth of God affords much scope for instruction. THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD
   WILL PROVE THAT HE IS NOT STRAITENED and at the last all men shall
   acknowledge His power, whether they have bowed to it or not! He will be
   magnified in those who are saved and in those who are lost.

   He will exact punishment for resistance. Those who now despise the
   messages which are sent to them will, at last, be left to their own
   devices. "My Spirit shall not always strive with man," says the Eternal
   God. And continual rejection will, at last, end in the total withdrawal
   of His Presence and the eternal ruin of all who have resisted Him.

   But notwithstanding the rejection of men, He will fulfill the Divine
   Decree. Man's obstinacy shall not frustrate the purpose of God and the
   things which He has predestinated shall surely come to pass. In this
   shall be clear evidence that the Spirit of the Lord was not straitened.
   Not one of God's chosen shall be suffered to continue in the way to
   ruin--they shall all be effectually called and enabled to embrace
   Christ as He is freely preached to them in the Gospel!

   Thus, the third proof will be given, in that He will glorify Christ and
   prepare a people to welcome His Advent. The Gospel shall be preached
   among all nations and out of every tribe and people witnesses shall be
   gathered to await the glorious appearing of the victorious Christ which
   cannot be long delayed. Then it shall be seen how grandly the Spirit of

   the Lord has perfected both the number and the character of the Church,
   which, like a chaste virgin, shall be presented to the Lamb as the
   reward of His agony and intercession!

   You that are not converted, but are longing to be, what are you waiting
   for, seeing that the Spirit of the Lord is thus always ready to work
   and will never be more able at another time than He is now? The great
   point with many is to precipitate decision, to bring them across the
   border. You are almost over it! You have often been so. You are almost
   persuaded. O Spirit of God, make them believe in Jesus now! May they
   turn their eyes to Him who hung upon the Cross and look, now, and live!
   What reason should there be why tomorrow should be better for repenting
   than today? In what way can 1892 be better than 1891? I am at a loss to
   think, but I can easily find a great many reasons why delays are
   dangerous, why delays are expensive, why delays will end in rejections!
   May God the Holy Spirit come and turn you to God now, lest, at last,
   you should share in that awful judicial blindness which falls on those
   who spurn His entreaties--lest the Gospel should be hid from you
   because you are lost--lest standing in the way of God's purpose, you
   should be cut down as a cumberer of the ground! Lest, at last, you
   should miss being numbered with that glorious throng who are now being
   called away from their idols to serve the living God and to wait for
   His Son from Heaven!

   Has He not said, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out"?
   When may they come? Whenever they come He will not cast them out! What
   sort of people will He receive? "Him that comes"--any, "him," that
   comes, no matter who he or she is! How do they come? They must just
   trust--trust Jesus! May the Holy Spirit enable you to trust Him now!
   The Lord bless you, for His name's sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Micah 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

A Harp of Ten Strings

   (No. 2219)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 30, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has
   rejoiced in God my Savior." Luke 1:46, 47.

   IT is very clear that Mary was not beginning a new thing, for she
   speaks in the present tense, and in a tense which seems to have been
   present for a long time, "My soul does magnify the Lord." Ever since
   she had received the wonderful tidings of the choice which God had made
   of her for her high position, she had begun to magnify the Lord. And
   when once a soul has a deep sense of God's mercy and begins magnifying
   Him, there is no end to it. This grows by what it feeds upon--the more
   you magnify God, the more you can magnify Him. The higher you rise, the
   more you can see. Your view of God is increased in extent and, whereas
   you praised Him somewhat at the bottom of the hill, when you get nearer
   and nearer to the top of His exceeding goodness, you lift up the strain
   still more loudly and your soul does more fully and exultantly magnify
   the Lord!

   "My soul does magnify the Lord." What does it mean? The usual meaning
   of the word, "magnify," is to make great, or to make to appear great.
   We say, when we use the microscope, that it magnifies so many times.
   The insect is the same small and tiny thing, but it is increased to our
   apprehension. The word is very suitable in this connection. We cannot
   make God greater than He is. Nor can we have any conception of His
   actual greatness. He is infinitely above our highest thoughts! When we
   meditate upon His attributes--

   "Imagination's utmost stretch In wonder dies away."

   But we magnify Him by having higher, larger, truer conceptions of Him,
   by making known His mighty acts and praising His glorious name so that
   others, too, may exalt Him in their thoughts. This is what Mary was
   doing--she was a woman who was given, in later life, to pondering.
   Those who heard what the shepherds said concerning the Holy Child
   Jesus, wondered, but, "Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in
   her heart." They wondered--Mary pondered. It is only the change of a
   letter, but it makes a great difference in the attitude of the soul--a
   change from a vague flash of interest to a deep attention of heart. She
   pondered. She weighed the matter. She turned it over in her mind. She
   thought about it. She estimated its value and result. She was like that
   other Mary, a meditative woman who could quietly wait at her Lord's
   feet to hear gracious words and drink them in with yearning faith.

   It is no idle occupation, then, to get alone and in your own hearts to
   magnify the Lord--to make Him great to your mind, to your
   affections--great in your memory, great in your expectations. It is one
   of the grandest exercises of the renewed nature! You need not, at such
   a time, think of the deep questions of Scripture. You may leave the
   abstruse doctrines to wiser heads, if you will, but if your very soul
   is bent on making God great to your own apprehension, you will be
   spending time in one of the most profitable ways possible to a child of
   God. Depend upon it, there are countless holy influences which flow
   from the habitual maintenance of great thoughts of God--just as there
   are incalculable mischiefs which flow from our small thoughts of Him!
   The root of false theology is belittling God and the essence of true
   Divinity is greatening God, magnifying Him and enlarging our
   conceptions of His majesty and His Glory to the utmost degree.

   But Mary did not mean, by magnifying the Lord, merely to extol Him in
   her own thoughts. Being a true poetess, she intended to magnify the
   Lord by her words. No, I must correct myself--she did not intend to do
   it--she had been doing it all along! She was doing it when she came,
   panting and breathless, into her cousin Elizabeth's house. She said,
   "My soul does magnify the Lord. I am now in such a favored condition
   that I cannot open my mouth to talk to you, Elizabeth, without speaking
   of my Lord. My soul now seems filled with thoughts of Him. I must
   speak, first of all, about Him and

   say such things of His Grace and power as may help even you, my goodly
   elder sister, still to think grander thoughts of God than you have ever
   before enjoyed. My soul does magnify the Lord."

   We must recall the fact that Mary was highly distinguished and honored.
   No other woman was ever blessed as she was. Perhaps no other could have
   borne the honor that was put upon her--to be the mother of the Human
   Nature of our Savior. It was the highest possible honor that could be
   put upon mortal and the Lord knew, at the appointed time, where to find
   a guileless, lowly woman who could be entrusted with such a gift and
   yet not seek to filch away His Glory. She is not proud. No, it is a
   false heart that steals the revenues of God and buys the intoxicating
   cup of self-congratulation. The more God gives to a true heart, the
   more it gives to Him. Like Peter's boat, which sank into the waters the
   more deeply, the more fully it was laden with fish, God's true children
   sink in their own esteem as they are honored by their Lord! God's
   gifts, when He gives Grace with them, do not puff us up--they build us
   up. A humble and lowly estimate of ourselves is added to a greater
   esteem of Him. The more God gives you, the more do you magnify Him and
   not yourself. Be this your rule--"He must increase and I must
   decrease." Be you less and less. Be you the Lord's humble handmaid, yet
   bold and confident in your praise of Him who has done for you great
   things! From now on and forever, let this be the one description of
   your life--"My soul does magnify the Lord; I have nothing else to do
   any more but to magnify Him and to rejoice in God my Savior."

   A week might be profitably employed were I to attempt to preach upon
   each part of Mary's song, but with quite another purpose in view I am
   going to present it to you as a whole. As I put before you this
   instrument of ten strings, I will ask you, just for a minute or two, to
   place your fingers on each of them as they shall be indicated and see
   whether you cannot wake some melody to the praise of the great King,
   some harmony in His honor--whether you cannot, at this good hour,
   magnify the Lord and rejoice in God your Savior! Luther used to say
   that the glory of Scripture was to be found in the pronouns and it is
   certainly true of the text. Look at the personal touch of them, how it
   comes over and over again! "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my
   spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior."

   At one of our Orphanage Festivals, I put before our many friends who
   were gathered together, several reasons why everybody should contribute
   to the support of the children. Indeed, I said, nobody ought to go off
   the ground without giving something. I was struck with one Brother who
   had no money with him, but who brought me his watch and chain. "Oh," I
   said, "do not give me these, these things sell for so little compared
   with their value." But he insisted upon my keeping them and said, "I
   will redeem them tomorrow, but I cannot go away without giving
   something now." How glad I would be if every child of God here would be
   as earnest in adoration and say, "I am going to give some praise to God
   at this service--out of some of those strings I will get music--perhaps
   out of them all. I will endeavor with my whole heart to say, at some
   portion of the sermon, and from some point of view, 'My soul does
   magnify the Lord!'" Do I hear you whisper, "My soul is very heavy."
   Lift it up, then, by praising the Lord! Begin a Psalm, even if at first
   the tune must be in a minor key! The strain will soon change and the
   "Miserere" will become a "Hallelujah Chorus."

   I. The first string which Mary seems to touch and which, I trust, we,
   too, may reach with the hand of faith, is that of THE GREAT JOY WHICH
   THERE IS IN THE LORD. "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has
   rejoiced in God my Savior." Let us bless God that our religion is not
   one of gloom! I do not know of any command anywhere in Scripture,
   "Groan in the Lord always, and again, I say, Groan." From the conduct
   of some people we might almost imagine that they must have altered
   their New Testament in that particular passage and thus woefully
   changed the glory of the original verse, "Rejoice in the Lord always,
   and again I say, Rejoice." The first I ever knew of Christ, my Master,
   truly, was when I found myself at the foot of His Cross with the great
   burden that had crushed me, effectually gone. I looked round for it,
   wondering where it could be and, behold, it was tumbling down into His
   sepulcher! I have never seen it since, blessed be His name, nor do I
   ever want to see it again! Well do I remember the leaps I gave for joy
   when first I found that all my burden of guilt had been borne by Him
   and was now buried in the depths of His grave--

   "Many days have passed since then; Many changes I have seen."

   I have been to a great many wells to draw water, but when I have drawn
   it, and tasted it, it has been brackish as the waters of Marah. But
   whenever I have gone to this well--"my God, my Savior"--I have never
   drawn one drop that was not sweet and refreshing! He who truly knows
   God must be glad in Him--to abide in His house is to be still praising
   Him--yes, we may exalt in Him all day long! A very notable Word of God
   is that which is found in the mouth of

   David--"God, my exceeding joy." Other things may give us pleasure. We
   may be happy in the gifts of God and in His creatures, but God,
   Himself, the spring of all our joys, is greater than them all!
   Therefore, "Delight yourself, also, in the Lord." This is His
   command--is it not a lovely one? Let no one say that the faith of the
   Christian is not to be exultant! It is to be a delight and so greatly
   does God desire us to rejoice in Him, that to the command is added a
   promise, "And He shall give you the desires of your heart."

   What a religion is ours, in which delight becomes a duty--in which to
   be happy is to be obedient to a command! Heathen religions exact not
   only self-denials of a proper kind, but tortures which men invent to
   accustom themselves to misery. But in our holy faith, if we keep close
   to Christ, while it is true that we bear the cross, it is also true
   that the cross ceases to be a torture! In fact, it often bears us as we
   bear it--we discover in the service of our Master that "His yoke is
   easy and His burden is light," and, strange to say--His burden gives us
   rest and His yoke gives us liberty! We have never had anything from our
   Master but it has ultimately tended to our joy. Even when His rod has
   made us smart, He has intended it to work for our good and so it has!
   Praise Him, then, for such goodness!

   Our religion is one of holy joy, especially with regard to our Savior.
   The more we understand that glorious word, "Savior," the more are we
   ready to dance with delight. "My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior."
   The good tidings of great joy have reached us and as we, by His Grace,
   have believed them, He has saved us from sin, death and Hell! He has
   not simply promised to do it some day, but He has done it--we have been
   saved! What is more, we have, many of us, entered into rest by faith in
   Him. Salvation is to us a present experience at this hour, though we
   still wait for the fullness of it to be revealed in the world to come.

   Oh, come, let us joy in our Savior! Let us thank Him that we have so
   much for which to thank Him! Let us praise Him that there is so much
   that we may rejoice in! No, so much that we must rejoice in! Let us
   adore His dear name that He has so arranged the whole plan of
   salvation--that it is calculated to bring Heaven to us while we are
   here--and to bring us who are here, into Heaven hereafter! Thus we lift
   up our hearts because of the great joy there is laid up for us in God.
   This is the first string. Touch it. Think of all the joy you have had
   in God. Praise Him for all the holy mirth He has given you in His
   House--the bliss of communion with Him at His table--the delights of
   fellowship with Him in secret. Sing to Him with a grateful heart,
   saying, "My soul does magnify the Lord."

   II. The second string we would desire to lay our fingers on is THE
   GODHEAD OF OUR SAVIOR. "My soul does magnify the Lord." I have not a
   little Lord. "And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior." I know that
   my Savior is a Man and rejoice in His Humanity, but we will contend to
   the death for this--that He is more than Man--He is our Savior! One
   human being could not redeem another, or give to God a ransom for his
   brother. An angel's arm could not bear the tremendous load of the
   disaster of the Fall, but Christ's arm is more than angelic! He whom we
   magnify as our Savior counted it not robbery to be equal with God. And
   when He undertook the wondrous task of our redemption, He brought the
   Godhead with Him to sustain Him in the more than Herculean labor. Our
   trust is in Jesus Christ, very God of very God! We shall never cease,
   not only to believe in Him, but to speak of Him, rejoice in Him and
   sing of Him as the Incarnate Deity. What a frozen religion that is
   which has not the Godhead of Christ in it! Surely, they must be men of
   a very sanguine and imaginative temperament who can pretend to receive
   any comfort out of a Christianity which has not the Divine Savior as
   its very center. I would as soon think of going to an iceberg to warm
   myself, as to a faith of that kind to find comfort! Nobody can ever
   praise up Christ too much for you and for me--they can never say too
   much of His wisdom, or of His power. Every Divine attribute ascribed to
   Christ makes us lift up a new song unto Him, for, whatever He may be to
   others, He is to us God over all, blessed forever! Amen.

   I wish that I could sing instead of speaking to you of Him who was with
   the Father before all worlds began, whose delights, even then, were
   with the sons of men in prospect of their creation. I wish that I could
   tell the wonderful story of how He entered into Covenant with God on
   the behalf of His people and pledged Himself to pay the debts of those
   His Father gave to Him. He undertook to gather into one fold, all the
   sheep whom He pledged Himself to purchase with His precious blood. He
   engaged to bring them back from all their wanderings and fold them on
   the hilltops of the Delectable Mountains at His Father's feet. This He
   vowed to do and He has gone about His task with a zeal that clothed Him
   as a cloak--and He will achieve the Divine purpose before He delivers
   up the Kingdom to God, even the Father. "He shall not fail nor be
   discouraged."

   It is our delight to hear this Son of God, this Son of Mary, this
   wondrous Being in His complex Nature as our Mediator, exalted and
   extolled, and made very high. Have you not sometimes felt that if the
   minister preached more about Jesus Christ, you would be very glad to
   hear him? I hope that is your inclination, yet I am afraid that we talk
   a great deal about many things rather than about our Master. Come, let
   me hear of Him! Sing to me or talk to me of Jesus, whose name is honey
   in the mouth, music in the ear and Heaven in the heart! Oh, for more
   praise to His holy name! Yes, some of us can touch this string and say
   with Mary, "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced
   in God my Savior."

   III. The third string has softer, sweeter music in it, and it may suit
   some of us better than the more sublime themes

   that we have already touched. Let us sing and magnify the LORD'S LOVING
   CONDESCENSION, for so the blessed

   virgin did when she went on to say, "for He has regarded the low estate
   of His handmaiden." Here is something to sing about, for ours was not
   only a low estate, but perhaps some here would have had to say, like
   Gideon, "My family is poor, and I am the least in my father's house"
   and, like he, you would have been passed over by most of the people.
   Perhaps even in your own family you were counted as nobody. If there
   was a jest uttered, you were sure to be the butt of it, and generally
   you were misunderstood and your actions misinterpreted. This was a
   trying experience for you, but from this you have been gloriously
   delivered. It may have been that, like Joseph, you were a little dreamy
   and, perhaps, you were a trifle too fond of telling your dreams. Yet,
   though because of this you were much put upon, the Lord, at last,
   raised your head above those round about you. It may have been that
   your lot in life was cast among the very poorest and lowest of mankind,
   yet the Lord has looked upon you in infinite compassion and saved you!
   Will you not, then, magnify Him?

   If Christ wanted a people, why did He not choose the kings, princes and
   nobles of the earth? Instead of that, He takes the poor and makes them
   to know the wonders of His dying love! And instead of selecting the
   wisest men in the world, He takes even the most foolish and instructs
   them in the things of the Kingdom of God--

   "Wonders of Grace to God belong, Repeat His mercies in your song."

   All of us who have been saved by Grace must still strike a more tender
   note, for we were sinful as well as lowly. We went astray like lost
   sheep and, therefore, we magnify the Lord who bought us, sought us and
   brought us back to His fold. It may be painful to remember what we once
   were, but it is well, sometimes, to go back in our thoughts to the time
   past when we lived in sin, that we may the better appreciate the favor
   of which we have been made partakers. When the Apostle Paul wrote out a
   catalog of those who shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, he added,
   "And such were some of you: but you are washed." Oh, let us bless the
   name of the Lord and magnify Him for this! Who else could have cleansed
   us from our sin, or in what other Fountain save that opened to the
   house of David could we have plunged to rid us of our awful defilement?
   He stoops very low, for some of God's elect were once the offscouring
   of all things--and even when converted, many of them remained so, in
   the estimate of the world which sneers at humble Christians.

   If the professed followers of Christ happen to meet in some fine
   building and worship God with grand music and gorgeous rituals, then
   the people of the world put up with them! They may go even so far as to
   patronize them, though, even then, their respect is chiefly called
   forth, not on behalf of the people, but because of the building, the
   fine music and the carriages. The carriages are especially important,
   for without a certain number of them at the door, it is deemed
   impossible to have a proper display of cultured Christianity! But the
   more God's people cling to the Lord, the less likely are they to be
   esteemed by the vulgar judgment of unholy men. Yet the Lord has chosen
   such, blessed be His name! It is a great wonder to me that the Lord
   ever chose some of you--but it is a far greater wonder that He should
   ever have chosen me. I can somehow understand His love for you when I
   look at the gracious points in your character, though I am fully aware
   that they are only worked by Grace, but I cannot understand the love
   which He has displayed to me, who am the least of all the saints. "Oh!"
   you say, "that is what we were going to say about ourselves." Yes, I
   know. I am trying to put it into your mouths, so that we may all join
   in adoring gratitude! It is a miracle of mercy that He should have
   loved any of us, or stooped in His Grace to have raised such beggars
   from the dunghill to set us among the princes at His right hand--

   "Why was I made to hear Your voice, And enter while there's room;

   When thousands make a wretched choice, And rather starve than come."

   IV. The next string, however, is THE GREATNESS OF GOD'S GOODNESS, for
   Mary goes on to sing--"He has regarded the low estate of His
   handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me
   blessed." Oh, the Lord has done great things for His people! "He that
   is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is His name." God has
   made you blessed. You were once under the curse, but for you there is
   now no condemnation, for you are in Christ Jesus. If the curse had
   withered you, like some lightning-blasted oak, you would not have
   wondered, but, instead thereof, the gracious Lord has planted you by
   the rivers of water and He makes you to bring forth your fruit in your
   season and your leaf does not wither. "The Lord has done great things
   for us; whereof we are glad." To be lifted up from that horrible pit is
   such a great thing that we cannot measure it--but to be set up on that
   Throne of Mercy exceeds our highest thought--who can measure that? Take
   your line and see if you can fathom the depth of such Grace, or measure
   the height of such mercy! Shall we be silent when we behold such
   marvelous loving kindness? God forbid it! Let us break forth in our
   hearts, now, with gladsome hallelujahs to Him who has done such
   wonderful things for us!

   Think, Brothers and Sisters, you were blind--He has made you see! You
   were lame--He has made you leap! Worse than that, you were dead--He has
   made you live! You were in prison--and He has made you free! Some of us
   were in the dungeon with our feet fast in the stocks. Can I not well
   remember when I did lie in that inner prison, moaning and groaning,
   without any voice to comfort me, or even a ray of light to cheer me in
   the darkness? And now that He has brought me out, shall I forget to
   utter my deep thanks? No! I will sing a song of deliverance that others
   may hear, and fear, and turn unto the Lord! But that is not all. He has
   not only taken us from the prison, He has raised us to the Throne of
   God--you and I could go in and out of Heaven tonight if God called us
   there--and every angel would treat us with respect! If we entered into
   Glory, even though we had come from the poorest home in London, we
   would find that the highest angels are only ministering servants to the
   chosen people of God! Oh, He has done wonders for us!

   I am not so much attempting to preach as trying to wake up your memory,
   that you may think of the goodness of the Lord's Grace and say, "Oh,
   yes, it is so, and my soul does magnify the Lord!" Not one of the
   wonders of Divine Grace has been worked for us without deep necessity
   for its manifestation. If the very least Grace which may, perhaps, up
   to now have escaped your attention, were taken from you, where would
   you be? I often meet with people of God who used to be very happy and
   joyful, but who have fallen into despondency, and who now talk about
   the mercies of God's Covenant love in such a way as to make me blush.
   They say, "I thought I once had that blessing, Sir, and I am afraid I
   have not got it now, though there is nothing I long for more. Oh, what
   a precious thing it would be to be able to have access to God in
   prayer! I would give my eyes to be able to know that I am really a
   child of God."

   Yet those of us who have those blessings do not half value them. No,
   Brothers and Sisters, we do not value them a thousandth part as much as
   we ought! Our constant song should be, "Blessed be the Lord, who daily
   loads us with benefits, even the God of our salvation." Instead of
   that, we often take the gifts thoughtlessly and unthankfully from His
   hands. When a man is in the ocean, he may have much water over his head
   and not feel it, but when He comes out, if you then put a little pail
   of water on his head, it becomes quite a burden as he carries it. So
   some of you are swimming in God's mercy--you are diving into it and you
   do not recognize the weight of the Glory which God has bestowed upon
   you. But if you should once get out of this ocean of joy and fall into
   a state of sadness of heart, you would begin to appreciate the weight
   of any one of the mercies which now do not seem to be of much
   consequence, or to make any claim upon your gratitude. Without waiting
   to lose the sense of God's Grace, in order that we may know the value
   of it, let us bless Him who has done such inconceivably great things
   for us, and say, "My soul does magnify the Lord."

   V. The fifth string that I would touch is THE COMBINATION OF GRACE AND
   HOLINESS that there is in what

   God has done for us. "He that is mighty has done great things for me;
   and holy is His name." I may not even hint at the peculiar delicacy of
   Mary's case, but she knew that it was wholly holy and pure. Now, when
   the Lord has saved you and me, who did not deserve saving, He did a
   very wonderful act of Sovereign Grace in making us to differ, but the
   mercy is that He did it all justly. Nobody can say that it ought not to
   be done. At the Last Great Day, what God has done in His Grace will
   stand the test of justice, for He has never, in the splendor and
   lavishness of His love, violated the principles of eternal
   righteousness, even to save His own elect. "He that is mighty has done
   to me great things; and holy is His name."

   Sin must be punished--it has been punished in the Person of our
   glorious Substitute. No man can enter into Heaven unless he is
   perfectly pure--they who are redeemed shall take no unclean thing
   within the gates. Every rule and mandate of the Divine empire shall be
   observed. The Law-Maker will not be the Law-Breaker even to save the
   sinner! But His Law

   shall be honored as surely as the sinner shall be saved. Sometimes I
   feel that I could play on this string for an hour or two. Here we have
   Justice magnified in Grace and holiness rejoicing in the salvation of
   sinners! The attributes of God are like the amazing crystal shining out
   with its clear white light, but which may be divided into all the
   colors of the prism, each different and all beautiful. The dazzling
   radiance of God is too glorious for our mortal eyes, but each
   Revelation teaches us more of His beauty and perfectness. In the ruby
   light of an atoning Sacrifice we are enabled to see how God is just and
   yet the Justifier of him that believes in Jesus. Glory be to His name
   for the power of Grace mingled with holiness! My soul does magnify the
   Lord for this wonderful salvation in which every attribute shall have
   its glory--justice as well as mercy, wisdom as well as might. "Mercy
   and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each
   other." Who could have invented such a plan and who could have carried
   it out when it was thought of? Only He who came "with dyed garments
   from Bozrah." "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has
   rejoiced in God my Savior."

   VI. The sixth string is one which should be sweet in every way. Mary
   now goes on to touch the string of GOD'S MERCY. "And His mercy is on
   them that fear Him." The saints of old often touched this string in the
   Temple. They often sang it, lifting up the refrain again and
   again--"His mercy endures forever!"--

   "For His mercy shall endure, Ever faithful, ever sure."

   Mercy! Sinner, this is the silver bell for you--it is of the Lord's
   mercies that you are not consumed--because His compassions fail not.
   Listen to the heavenly music that calls you to repent and live! God
   delights in mercy. He waits to be gracious. Mercy! Saint, this is the
   golden bell for you, for you still need mercy. Standing with your foot
   upon the jasper doorstep of Paradise, with the pearly gate just before
   you, you will still need mercy to help you over the last step. And when
   you enter the choir of the redeemed, mercy shall be your perpetual
   song! In Heaven you will chant the praises of the God of Grace whose
   mercy endures forever.

   Do you mourn over your own backsliding? God will have mercy upon you,
   dear child, though you have wandered since you have known Him! Come
   back to Him this very hour! He would woo you again. He would press you
   to His bosom. Have you not often been restored? Have you not often had
   your iniquities put away from you in the years gone by? If so, again,
   this moment, touch this string--a child's finger can make it bring
   forth its music--touch it now! Say, "Yes, concerning mercy, mercy to
   the very chief of sinners, my soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit
   has rejoiced in God my Savior."

   VII. Time would fail us if we tried to dwell at any length upon these
   wondrous themes, so we pass to the next string, number seven, GOD'S
   IMMUTABILITY, because in the verse we have already touched upon, there
   are two notes. Mary said, "His mercy is on them that fear Him from
   generation to generation." He that had mercy in the days of Mary, has
   mercy today--"from generation to generation," He is the same God. "I am
   the Lord, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed."
   You that once delighted in the Lord, do not suppose that He has
   changed! He still invites you to come and delight in Him! He is "Jesus
   Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever." What a poor
   foundation we would have for our hope if God could change! But He has
   confirmed His Word by an oath, "that by two immutable things, in which
   it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation,
   who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us."

   The God of my grandfather, the God of my father, is my God this
   day--the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is the God of every Believer!
   He is the same God and is prepared to do the same--and to be the same
   to us as to them! Look back into your own experience. Have you not
   found God always the same? Come, protest against Him, if you have ever
   found Him to change! Is the Mercy Seat altered? Do the promises of God
   fail? Has God forgotten to be gracious? Will He no more be favorable?
   No, even "if we believe not, yet He abides faithful: He cannot deny
   Himself!" And when all things melt away, this one eternal Rock abides!
   Therefore, "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced
   in God my Savior." It is a blessed string to touch! If we had time, we
   would play upon it and evoke such harmonies as would make the angels
   want to join us in the chorus!

   VIII. The next string which will awaken a responsive echo in your
   hearts is GOD'S POWER. "He has showed strength with His arm; He has
   scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts." This string
   gives us deep bass music and requires a heavy hand to make it pour
   forth any melody. What wonders of power God has worked on the behalf of

   His people, from the days of Egypt, when the horse and his rider He
   cast into the Red Sea, even till now! How strong is His arm to defend
   His people!

   In these days some of us have been driven to look to that power, for
   all other help has failed. You know how it was in the dark ages--it
   seemed as if the darkness of popery would never be removed--but how
   soon it was gone when God called forth His men to bear witness to His
   Son! What reason we have to rejoice that He "scattered the proud in the
   imagination of their hearts"! They thought that they could readily burn
   up the heretics and put an end to this Gospel of theirs, but they could
   not do it. And today there is a dark conspiracy to stamp out the
   evangelical faith. First, on the part of some who go after their
   superstitions, they set up the crucifix to hide the Cross and point men
   to sacraments instead of to the Savior.

   And then, worse than these, are those who undermine our faith in Holy
   Scripture--they tear from the Book this chapter and that, deny this
   great Truth of God and the other--and try to bring the inventions of
   man into the place that ought to be occupied by the Truth of God. But
   the Lord lives! Jehovah's arm has not waxed short! Depend upon it,
   before many years have passed, He will take up the quarrel of His
   Covenant and will bring the old banner to the front again! We shall yet
   rejoice to hear the Gospel preached in the most plain terms,
   accentuated by the Holy Spirit, Himself, upon the hearts of His people.
   Let us touch this string again! The Almighty God is not dead! "Behold,
   the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither His ear
   heavy, that it cannot hear."

   IX. The next string is one that some friends do not like. At least they
   do not say much about it--it is DIVINE SOVEREIGNTY. Listen to it. You
   know how God thunders it out. "I will have mercy on whom I will have
   mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
   God's will is supreme! Whatever the wills of men may be, God will not
   be driven from His Throne, nor will His scepter be made to quiver in
   His hands! After all the rebellious acts of men and devils, He will
   still be eternal and supreme, with His Kingdom ruling over all. And
   thus the virgin sings, "He has put down the mighty from their seats,
   and exalted them of low degree. He has filled the hungry with good
   things; and the rich He has sent empty away." Who can speak the wonders
   of His Sovereign Grace? Was it not strange that He should ever have
   chosen you?--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem,

   Or give the Creator delight?

   'Twas even so, Father,'you must ever sing,

   Because it seemed good in Your sight.'" Is it not strange that the Lord
   should not take the Kings and mighty ones, but should so order it, that
   the poor have the Gospel preached to them? God is King of kings and
   Lord of lords--and He acts like a king. "He gives not account of any of
   His matters." But He lets us see right clearly that He has no respect
   to the greatness and fancied goodness of man--that He does as He
   pleases and that He pleases to give His mercy to them that fear Him and
   bow before Him! He dispenses His favors to those who tremble at His
   Presence, who come humbly to His feet and take His mercy as a free
   gift--who look to His dear Son because they have nothing else to look
   to and, as poor, guilty worms, find in Christ their life, their wisdom,
   their righteousness, their all! Oh, the splendor of this great King!

   X. The tenth string is GOD'S FAITHFULNESS. "He has helped His servant
   Israel, in remembrance of His mercy; as He spoke to our fathers, to
   Abraham, and to his seed forever." God remembers what He has said. Take
   those three words, "As He spoke." Whatever He said, though it was
   thousands of years ago, it stands fast forever and ever! God cannot
   lie. Beloved, are any of you in trouble? Search the Scriptures till you
   find a promise that suits your case. And when you get it, do not say,
   "I hope that this is true." That is an insult to your God! Believe it,
   believe it up to the hilt! Do as I have seen boys do in the swimming
   hole--take a header and go right into the stream of God's mercy! Dive
   as deeply as you can--there is no drowning here! These are "waters to
   swim in" and the more you can lose yourself in this blessed crystal
   flood of promised mercy, the better it shall be! You shall rise up out
   of it as the sheep come from the washing! You shall feel refreshed
   beyond measure in having cast yourself upon God!

   When God's promises fail, let us know of it, for some of us have lived
   so long on those promises that we do not care to live on anything else!
   And if they can be proved to be false, we had better give up living
   altogether! But we delight to know that they are all absolutely
   true--what God said to our fathers stands good to their children--and
   will stand good even to the end of time and to all eternity.

   If any of you have not been able to touch even one of these strings, I
   would bid you get to your knees and cry to God, and say, "Why is it
   that I cannot magnify You, O Lord?" I should not be surprised if you
   discovered the reason to be that you are so big, yourself. He never
   magnifies God who magnifies himself! Belittle yourself and magnify your
   God! Down with self to the lowest depths and up, higher and still
   higher, with your thoughts of God!

   Poor Sinner, you that have not yet laid hold on God, there is sweet
   music even for you in the virgin's song. Perhaps you are saying, "I am
   nothing but a lump of sin and a heap of misery." Very well. Leave the
   lump of sin and the heap of misery and let Christ be your All-in-All!
   Give yourself up to Christ. He is a Savior--let Him do His own
   business. If a man sets up to be a lawyer and I have a case in court, I
   should not think of giving him the case and then, afterwards, go into
   court and begin to meddle with it for myself! If I did, he would say,
   "I must drop the case if you do not let it alone."

   Sometimes the idea may come into your mind that you will do something
   towards saving yourself and have some share in the glory of your
   salvation. If you do not get rid of that idea, you will be lost!
   Surrender yourself to Christ and let Him save you! And then,
   afterwards, He will work in you to will and to do of His own good
   pleasure, while you shall make melody in your heart unto the Lord--and
   from this harp of ten strings shall proceed such delightful music that
   many shall listen with such rapture that they shall go to your Master
   and take lessons in this heavenly music for themselves!

   The Lord bless you, Beloved, and send you away happy in Him!

Three Decisive Steps

   (No. 2220)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   8, 1891.

   "Audit came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath Jearim, that the
   time was long; for it was twenty years. And all the house of Israel
   lamented after the Lord. And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel,
   saying, If you return to the Lord with all your hearts, then put away
   the strange gods and Ashtaroth from amongyou, andprepare your hearts
   for the Lord, and serve Him only: and He will deliver you out of the
   hands of the Philistines. Then the children of Israel put away Baalim
   and Ashtaroth, and served the Lord only. And Samuel said, Gather all
   Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray to the Lord for you." 1 Samuel 7:2-5.

   Two enemies held Israel in subjection. The Philistines had fought
   against them and defeated them, even though they sent to Shiloh and
   brought the Ark of the Covenant, the symbol of Jehovah's Presence, into
   their camp. The Lord was not with them, so they were smitten with a
   great slaughter. The crowning disaster of the day was "the Ark of God
   was taken." The Philistines carried it away to Ashdod and set it in the
   house of Dagon, their idol. You remember how God, jealous for His honor
   and Glory, worked mighty wonders, causing Dagon to fall and inflicting
   punishment on every city where the ark came, until, at last, the
   Philistines, wearied with their trials, sent the Ark back to the people
   on whose behalf Jehovah had shown Himself so strong. Twenty years the
   Ark abode at Kirjath Jearim and, during all that time, Israel was under
   the hand of the Philistines.

   But a worse enemy than the Philistines held sway over the land. Though
   the Ark had returned, the people had gone away from their God and had
   set up the abominable worship of Baal and Astarte, the idols of the
   Phoenicians and other heathen nations by whom they were surrounded. I
   will not stay to explain to you about these gods. Suffice it to say
   that the Baalim were the male gods and the Ashtaroth the female--and
   that worship of these idols was attended with great lewdness and
   filthiness--in fact, the holy things of Baal and Astarte we would call
   obscene and degrading. The people were thus in double bondage. The
   heavy yoke of the Philistines was upon them because the heavier burden
   of a false worship crushed out the life of their hearts.

   It may very naturally be asked, "Where was Samuel all that time?" I
   know not what he was doing during those 20 years, but I have a
   suspicion. I will say I have a firm persuasion that he was going from
   place to place, preaching in quiet spots wherever he could gather an
   audience, warning the people of their sin and stirring them up to seek
   Jehovah, thus endeavoring to infuse some spirituality into their
   national life. But "the time was long." He plowed and seemed to plow a
   rock. For 20 years the good man spoke. For 20 years he acted like a
   battering ram upon a wall that did not seem to tremble beneath his
   strokes. For 20 years he went up and down, fleeing for his life from
   the Philistines, but venturing out, whenever he had an opportunity, to
   warn a household or a village group, or, perhaps, a township, that they
   could only be delivered from the Philistines by seeking God--that they
   had come into their present evil case by forsaking Jehovah and, that,
   unless they came back to the worship of the only true God, they would
   never again have their liberties.

   "The time was long," very long, for him to keep on speaking, warning a
   people who did not seem to care for his message. But constant dripping
   wears away stones and, at last, the inert mass against which he had
   battered began to move and there arose a general feeling of enquiry all
   over the country--"all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord."
   Then was Samuel's time to strike, while the iron was hot! He had spent
   20 years in getting it hot and he did not miss the opportunity when, at
   last, it came! He pleaded with the people and plainly showed them the
   only way in which they could expect help--namely, by putting away their
   false gods and returning with prepared hearts to the service of
   Jehovah.

   That the continual prayers and efforts of Samuel were crowned with
   success should encourage all those who, in days of unfaithfulness and
   apostasy, still lift up their voices for the Truth of God! Keep pegging
   away, my Brothers, though the people may seem to be indifferent to your
   message, or stiffen their necks against it. Do not give up though in
   the service of the base idols they seem wholly to forget God! The Lord
   will yet arise in His own good time and His cause shall triumph!
   Prepare a way for Him, of whom it is written, "Your people shall be
   willing in the day of Your power." Now, I believe that my case, with
   regard to some to whom I am speaking, is something like that of Samuel.
   I have, at least, the same message to deliver.

   I hope to be able to make this plain by showing you, first, that these
   people were in a very hopeful condition. That, secondly, they were
   called upon to take very decided steps. And, thirdly, that they were
   helped to do so by faith. True, it was faith in Samuel--and you get
   much more help if you have faith in a greater than Samuel who is still
   here among us, even our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!

   I. First, then, THESE PEOPLE WERE IN A VERY HOPEFUL CONDITION. "All the
   house of Israel lamented after the Lord." What does it mean?

   It means, first, that they were greatly oppressed. Their goods were
   taken from them. They were beaten. They saw their children slain. They
   were the slaves of the Philistines and, therefore, they began to say,
   "Why should we not return to our God? When we were true to Jehovah,
   there were no Philistines to trouble us. They were put to rout when we
   served God. It was better with us then, than now. Samson, when the
   Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, slew a thousand of them with
   the jawbone of an ass. Oh, for a day of Samson back again! Oh, for a
   day of God back again!" Their oppressions made them think of God.

   Do I not address some whose many troubles are compelling them to think
   of God? All went well with you, once, and then you were an atheist.
   Troubles are multiplying, now, and atheism does not suit you. You have
   buried those you loved. Ah, the grass has not yet grown on that
   newly-formed grave and your heart is aching after something, you
   scarcely know what! There were days with you, perhaps, in your youth,
   when you knelt at your mother's knee--and in your early manhood, when
   you went to the House of God and seemed to be one of God's people. You
   sigh as you think of happier days--but all goes wrong with you, now,
   and a voice seems to say to you, especially in the still of night,
   "Return, return, return!" You have wandered, like a sheep, from the
   pasture to the desert, from the shepherd's care into danger from the
   wolf. May God grant that you may, in this way, begin to lament after
   the Lord!

   I think that by the house of Israel lamenting after the Lord, is meant,
   next, that they began to be inwardly convinced that nobody could help
   them but the Lord. "Ah," said one, "would God these Philistines were
   driven away!" "Ah," said his companion, "nobody can do it but Jehovah."
   And then the first one answered, "Then, would that Jehovah were here!
   Oh, for His mighty hand and His terrible power to drive away our
   enemies!" "Israel lamented after the Lord." Samuel had taught them to
   some purpose, seeing that when they saw their need, they did not look
   for help to him, but to his Master. Some teachers attract attention to
   themselves and are like the moon when it shines--everybody says, "What
   a beautiful moon!" The true Prophet of God shines like the sun and
   people do not say, "What a beautiful sun!" but, "How lovely is the
   landscape!" Let it be your ambition to so declare the Word of God that
   people will not say, "What a splendid preacher!" but, "How glorious is
   his Christ!"

   No man must come between the seeker and God, for the best of men are
   but men at their best. Not even the ordinances of religion can meet the
   need of the people, though they are God-appointed--they were meant to
   lead us to God--and not to be a substitute for Him! When the
   Philistines triumphed, as we read in the fourth chapter, the elders of
   Israel said, "Let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of
   Shiloh unto us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the
   hand of our enemies." And lo, when it came, it did not save them! When
   people trust in the religious symbol instead of the spiritual power,
   they are idolaters in heart and invite disaster!

   But the house of Israel did not lament after the Ark--they lamented
   after the Lord, without whose Glory, shining between the cherubim, even
   the Ark was void and valueless! Am I speaking to one who has come to
   this conviction-- "Nobody can help me but God. I am so down at the
   heel, so broken in spirit, I am brought into such a condition, that
   unless the heavens are rent and the right hand of God appears, there is
   no rescue for me"? I am right glad you are brought into that condition!
   There is much gained when you look away from all others and from all
   else, to God. Say now, "I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, from
   where comes my help. My help comes from the Lord who made Heaven

   and earth." And if your soul still sighs, "Oh, that He would help me!
   Oh, that it were true that He did hear me and would come to my
   rescue!"--remember His words, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I
   will deliver you, and you shall glorify

   Me."

   In some such case were the people of Israel and when it says that they,
   "lamented after the Lord," it seems to me that, while they desired Him,
   they were afraid that He would not deliver them. They prayed after a
   fashion, but there was a dash of doubt about it. So have I known many
   go up to their closet to pray and they have said, "O God, if so vile a
   sinner can be forgiven, if there is such a thing as salvation for a
   backslider, if sins like mine can be washed away, oh, that I might be
   saved!" They have prayed with an, "if," and a, "perhaps" and a,
   "maybe"--lamenting after the Lord with many a moan, sigh, cry of
   despair--and then, just a little drop or two of hope! Lamenting after
   the Lord--I do not quite know how to describe it. But I know the
   distressing condition very well--that state in which the soul feels it
   needs God and would give anything to be saved, is willing to submit to
   Him and is anxious to be forgiven, but always is haunted with the dark
   thought--"It is not for you. He will never stretch His arms of mercy so
   far as to reach you. You are outside the Covenant! You are past hope."
   Still, even though this is a very dark state of mind to be in, it is a
   hopeful state of mind. It is much better than presumption or
   carelessness.

   Moreover, these people had very little hope but they had very much
   desire. "They lamented after the Lord." I suppose their lamentation
   after the Lord was in this fashion--"Oh, that God would be our God! But
   then He never will. Oh, that He would deliver us from the Philistines!
   But then He never will." Their prayer was damp for lack of faith. Their
   tinder would not burn. They did not rejoice to believe in the Lord, but
   they "lamented" after Him--they kept sorrowing and sighing, moaning and
   crying--needing Him, but never coming to Him. I know that I now address
   some who have regularly attended the preaching of the Gospel for years.
   You are not without a sense of sin. You are not without anxious
   desires. You are not without very anxious feelings at times. Sometimes
   you would give your eyes that you might know Christ and you feel as if
   you could willingly die if you could but know that you were saved. But,
   still, you cannot believe it possible--and that doubt still hangs over
   you. But it is possible! It is more than possible! It is absolutely
   certain that he who believes in Christ has everlasting life and he that
   comes to Him, He will in no wise cast out! He is ready to forgive. He
   delights in mercy. He overflows with compassion. "If you seek Him, He
   will be found of you." Your lamentations after the Lord may be
   sweetened with a good hope that, coming to Him, He will accept you!

   If you read the third verse, you will see that, all this while, they
   had not parted with their idols. They lamented after the Lord, but they
   did not get the Lord because they wanted to have the Lord and to have
   their idols, too. There are men in the world who want to go to Heaven,
   but they want to stay on the road to Hell! They would get to the north
   by traveling to the south. There are some who would go home to their
   Father, but they would like to take the swine, the swine troughs and
   the husks with them! A pretty sight, that prodigal would have been,
   would he not, driving the hogs and carrying the hog troughs on his
   back, to his father's house? Such a picture is not to be imagined. It
   never existed in fact and never can. John Bunyan tells us that when he
   was playing at the game of "cat," one Sunday, on Elstow Green, as he
   was going to strike the cat with his stick, he thought he heard a
   voice, crying, "Will you keep your sins, and go to Hell; or will you
   give up your sins and go to Heaven?"

   That question, without an angel's voice, you may hear at this moment! I
   put it now to some of you who would like to keep your sins and yet go
   to Heaven! You lament after the Lord. You would be a saint, but then
   you want to be a sinner, too. You would be a child of God, but then you
   would not like to turn out of the devil's family. You would not like to
   be ridiculed by the world. No, you want the crown without the cross!
   You want the end without the way. You want Heaven without holiness and
   forgiveness without repentance--and this can never be. It is useless
   lamenting after the Lord if it does not lead you to give up your idols!

   One thing, however, was meant by this lamenting after the Lord. It
   meant that they could never rest till God returned. Some of you have
   tried many ways to get rest. Some years ago you got harpooned at a
   meeting and though, like a big whale, you have dragged out miles of
   line and gone to the bottom of the sea of sin, the harpoon still sticks
   in you! I know what you have been doing to get rest. You have tried the
   world and now there is nothing there that pleases you. You have tried
   sticking to business, but you are unsatisfied. You have made money, but
   you are a poorer man than you were when you began business! Poorer,
   really, than when you had not a penny to bless yourself with! In fact,
   you have not a penny that does bless you--all your pennies seem curses
   as they come in.

   And then you have tried philosophy. Oh, you are a wonderfully wise man,
   especially when you have just read a book full of infidelity! Then you
   are wiser than two Solomons rolled into one! And yet you are a fool and
   you know you are, for you cannot get any peace by that means. You try,
   sometimes, to talk big blasphemies, and that is because you are afraid.
   As boys will whistle when they go through the churchyard, and are
   afraid of ghosts, they whistle to keep their courage up. And some
   people talk very big things just to keep up their confidence--a
   confidence which they really do not possess, for they are dreadful
   cowards when they come to die! I wonder what you will try next? Will
   you try dissipation? Will you try drunkenness? Will you try the use of
   drugs? Well, well, if God means to save you, you will never rest till
   you are anchored in the port of Christ's atoning Sacrifice.

   Until you come to God by Jesus Christ, you shall never rest! You shall
   be weary of foot; you shall be weary of brain; you shall be sick at
   heart; you shall feel that life is not worth living; you shall feel
   darkness over all your brightness and you shall taste bitterness in all
   your sweets. If God means to save you, He will make you lament after
   Him. He has lamented after you--you cost your Savior many a tear. You
   cost your Savior nailed hands and feet. You cost your Savior bloody
   sweat. You cost Him His death and He will not have you trifle where He
   is so in earnest--and if you will not come without strong measures, He
   will make you come!

   You shall be like Noah's dove. The raven rested on the corpses, but the
   dove could not. For her there was no resting place--she must drop into
   the water and drown--but her weary wings, at last, bears her back to
   the ark! Noah opens the window, puts out his hand, takes her in his
   grasp and pulls her in unto him into the ark. Then was she peaceful and
   quiet. She had found her Noah--she had found her rest. And it is to be
   so with some of you, now. You may stand out against my Master, but He
   means to have you. I sometimes hear of persons getting very angry after
   a Gospel sermon-- and I say to myself, "I am not sorry for it."
   Sometimes when we are fishing, the fish gets the hook into his mouth.
   He pulls hard at the line--if he were dead, he could not--but he is a
   live fish, worth the getting, and though he runs away, for a while,
   with the hook in his jaws, he cannot escape. His very wriggling and his
   anger show that he has got the hook and the hook has got him. Have the
   landing-net ready--we shall land him by-and-by! Give him more line--let
   him use up his strength and then we will land him--and he shall belong
   to Christ forever!

   Some of you know well what all this means, so I need say no more upon
   this point.

   II. Let us notice, next, that THESE PEOPLE WERE CALLED UPON TO TAKE
   THREE VERY DECIDED

   STEPS. See how plainly and decidedly Samuel puts the matter--"If you
   return to the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods
   and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts for the Lord, and
   serve Him only."

   The first thing that they were to do was to "put away the strange
   gods." They were to go home and break the images of Baal, tear down the
   vile statues of Astarte and smash them to pieces, whether they were
   private images, or public ones. They were to clear out the whole tribe
   of idols! Now, if we would come back to God, we must get rid of all our
   false confidences--

   "The dearest idol I have known,

   Whatever that idol be, Help me to tear it from Your Throne And worship
   only Thee."

   Every man seems to have a different idol. One has pride--he is so
   wonderfully good, so self-righteous! He has never done anything wrong.
   He is quite as good as a Christian and some better. He gives himself an
   excellent character. He could not have a better. If it were not for the
   name at the bottom, which is his own, he could get any situation with
   such a character as he has! But then, you see, he has given it to
   himself. You will have to give up that nonsense, for you have not a
   good character, after all, and when you stand in the Light of God, you
   will see yourself to be defiled from head to foot!

   Another man's god is his self-confidence. Hear him talk. He understands
   everything! He does not need to be taught anything--and if there is
   anything in the Bible that he does not understand, why then he does not
   believe it! He knows better than God Almighty and the Holy Spirit! He
   can judge the Scriptures and tell you what they ought to be and he
   could have, himself, written a better book. So he says, sometimes, in
   his talk, or so he thinks. Ah, poor Soul! You will have to break that
   image of pride or it will be your ruin. Self-confidence, in all its
   shapes and forms, must be hurled down if God is to be set up in the
   heart!

   Alas, there are some that have the images of Baal and Ashtaroth in the
   form of lust. Ah, you cannot keep your sin and go to Heaven!
   Unchastity, fornication, adultery, uncleanness of body--these must be
   given up! God is ready to for-

   give the harlot and the fornicator, but they must quit their sins once
   and for all and forever. You cannot lie in the sty and yet go home to
   your Father. This abominable thing must be totally given up and never
   thought of again, if you would be forgiven and saved.

   Others, who are more respectable, have the god of covetousness. To make
   money, to save money, to grab, to grasp-- for this they will grind the
   workman in his wages. For this they will cheat in the quantity or the
   quality of their goods. All sorts of tricks in trade will be performed
   that they may get rich. Now, covetousness is idolatry. If you worship a
   god of gold, you will perish as much as if you worshipped a god of mud!
   Oh, that we might have this god driven out of us and have a living,
   generous spirit implanted!

   How many do I know, too, who have for an idol the god of drink! Old
   Bacchus sits astride not only the wine cask, but many a man's heart.
   The man, when sober and "all right," is what everybody calls, "a good
   fellow." But he must drink and when once he is drunk, then he is by no
   means a good fellow, but foul and vile in language and one knows not
   what he may do! Sir, you must quit strong drink if you would be saved.
   No drunkard has any inheritance in the Kingdom of God! Drunkenness must
   be given up, and chambering, and wantonness, and gluttony, and all the
   sins of the flesh! These gods must be broken. "Put away the strange
   gods from among you."

   There are others I know whose strange god is malice. They cannot
   forgive. Perhaps even while sitting in the House of God they are
   saying, "Well, I can forgive everybody except my brother. He served me
   a very bad turn. I can never forgive him." Or, possibly, some are like
   the man who, when dying, told the priest that he forgave So-and-So for
   all the wrong he had done him--"That is," he said, "if I die. But if I
   get up again, I'll make him rue it." Are there not many whose
   forgiveness of injuries is of that kind? It is a mere sham! But there
   is no going to Heaven unless, frankly and unreservedly, you can forgive
   others their offenses. Why, you cannot even pray the Lord's Prayer
   unless you do so! "Forgive us our sins; for we also forgive everyone
   that is indebted to us." You cannot get through that prayer, much less
   get through the narrow gate, so long as malice is in your heart!

   But I must not stay to enlarge here. Every man must discover his own
   idol, whatever it may be. And now let me most solemnly put it to each
   one of you--"If you will return unto the Lord with all your heart, then
   put away the strange gods that have ruled over you--and turn unto the
   Lord." That is the first decided step.

   Are you saying, "Well, I will put away these evil things; I will give
   up these sins"? I am glad you have come to that. But when? Can you put
   them away now, just now, do you think? "I was thinking," says one, "I
   have an engagement tomorrow that will be rather bad." Can you not put
   the thing away tonight? "Well, I should like to have one indulgence of
   the flesh." Ah, Sir, you will never put these sins away till you go and
   do it straight away! That prodigal son got back to his father because
   he went off directly. He ran away! I do not know upon what terms his
   master had engaged him, whether it was by the quarter, or by the week,
   but this I know--he no sooner came to his senses than off he went and
   never stopped! He ran off instantly. You must run away from your old
   master without giving him any notice, for if you give him any warning,
   you will never get away at all! God help us to break the images here
   and now! Down with them, whatever they may be, and turn at once to the
   Lord!

   Now, notice the next step of decision--"Put away the strange gods, and
   prepare your hearts for the Lord." The mere outward reformation was not
   enough. They might have torn down every idol in the land and have been
   no nearer God for that. See, in France, today, how the people who have
   for long bent the knee in superstition and idolatry, have, many of
   them, flung away their vain worship only to sink into infidelity. What
   better are they, when they exalt the "Goddess of Reason" where before
   stood the altars of the Papacy, when the heart is untouched and God is
   not in all their thoughts? Still, there are many in that land, as, I
   trust, there are many here, who are lamenting after God and only await
   the preparation of the heart which comes from Him, to bow in allegiance
   before His Throne. What, then, is the way to prepare the heart?

   The first thing is, confession of sin. The people said, "We have sinned
   against the Lord." Go and confess your sin unto God. The more
   particular you can be in that confession, the better. Go and
   acknowledge your iniquity with many sighs and tears--and with deep
   regret that you should have sinned as you have done. Lay every secret
   bare and let the Light of God explore every hidden corner. The surgeon
   who means to cure must first expose the wound and probe it to the
   bottom--and before we can be forgiven, we must make a clean breast of
   our guilt, calling a spade a spade, and not trying to excuse ourselves,
   or cover up the evil.

   Then resolve in your soul that you will quit these sins. No half
   measures will do--chronic diseases require thorough cures. You remember
   when Augustine, after a life of sin, heard what seemed to him a voice
   bidding him, "Take, read," he went to his New Testament and his eye
   lighted on the passage, "Put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not
   provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof." Then and there
   he determined to leave all his former lusts and, in the strength of
   Christ, to live a new life. It was the hour of his conversion--the axe
   was laid to the root of the tree and the old profligate life was
   utterly renounced! The sinner became a saint who led others in the way
   of holiness! And when he died, he left behind him a rich legacy of
   experience and instruction for the people of God. Whatever the sin is,
   it must

   go--

   "Repentance is to leave

   The sins we loved before,

   And show that we in earnest grieve,

   By doing so no more."

   Then there must be much prayer, for so it was with these people. Cry
   mightily unto God, "Lord, save me!" Cry again and again unto Him and
   make this to be your one cry, "Give me Christ, or else I die!" Nothing
   so prepares the heart for God as crying out after Him! The water brooks
   are sweeter to the hart that has panted after them. The blessing is
   twice valued that has been won by intercession. I have heard it said
   that a man who wins his wife too easily treats her too lightly. Whether
   it is true, I cannot say, but I am sure that the richest blessings of
   God come to those who urge their suit again and again and who will not
   be denied the Grace they seek. May the Holy Spirit give you this
   preparation of heart by a full confession, a strong resolve and mighty
   prayer!

   Remember, too, that there must be trust, or else the heart is not
   rightly prepared. We must get beyond the stage of "lamenting" and begin
   the act of "consenting." Not only wish and pray for the blessing, but
   rely on the Lord to send it! He who smote the first-born of the
   Egyptians and, with a strong hand and mighty arm, brought their fathers
   out of the house of bondage centuries earlier, could easily deliver
   them! He who gave them at first the land for a possession could still
   scatter their enemies. Why should they not expect Him to work a work in
   their day? By the memory of what God did for your forefathers, I exhort
   you to trust in my Savior. "We have heard with our ears, O God, our
   fathers have told us, what work You did in their days, in the times of
   old." Therefore, O great Jehovah, will we trust in You in this our day!

   Then, break away from the world. These people of Israel went home and
   smashed their idols. And then they gathered at Mizpeh, once more a
   separated people. It was like a declaration of war! Declare war at once
   with evil of every shape. Now, come, and enlist beneath the
   blood-stained banner of the Cross and say, "I am a follower of the
   Lamb, and I will not parley with iniquity. Let the Philistines come, if
   they will--I will not submit to them again. I will break loose from the
   world, God helping me."

   Perhaps you say this is not the preparation of the heart, but the
   beginning of the battle. I know it, but any old soldier who has been in
   the wars will tell you that the best preparation for the strife is the
   first encounter with the enemy! After the first shot or two, the coward
   heart becomes brave, and the trembling nerves are strung for action.
   Many a timid soul is kept from the joy of God's salvation simply for
   the lack of a bold separation from the world. A little moral courage is
   all that is lacking in the case of some of you. Come out boldly and
   declare your desire and decision. Difficulties will vanish in the act.
   The first confession of Christ is the best possible preparation for the
   next one.

   This matter of heart-preparation is most important. It is God's work
   and yet, as His Spirit is ever present to help our infirmities, it is
   also ours. You remember how Solomon, in the Proverbs, says to his son,
   "Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of
   life"? If the heart is divided, the life can never be true. You will
   notice how Samuel put before the people the necessity of being thorough
   in their decision--"Return unto the Lord with all your hearts," was his
   clarion call. If we expect God to be wholly for us, we must be wholly
   for Him, and keep back nothing from His control. The Thessalonians
   "turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God," and in
   like manner this preparation of heart, on the part of Israel, came
   between the two acts of turning from idols and serving God--and was the
   spring of both.

   Then the next step is the service of God--"Serve Him only," said
   Samuel. "Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
   and served the Lord only." It is not enough to give up serving
   evil--you must come and serve the Lord! That is to say, from this time
   forth your great aim must be to glorify God. If you would be saved, you
   must give up every object in life as a guiding star to you except
   serving God! Whatever He bids you do, you are to do. His will must be

   your law. Christ will save you, but He will have you take upon you His
   yoke and wear it. And as He is meek and lowly in heart, He would have
   you learn to be so, too. And then you shall find rest unto your soul.
   This is Christ's way--that where He comes to save, He comes to sanctify
   and make us obey His will and live to His praise. His smile is reward
   enough for the poor service we can render Him. His, "Well done," at
   last will be Heaven to the heart that loves Him! Oh, that many here
   would say, "Yes, I wish to serve the Lord and serve the Lord only. Too
   long have I drawn near to Him with my lips, while my heart was far from
   Him. 'O Lord our God, other lords beside You have had dominion over us:
   but by You, only, will we make mention of Your name.'"

   III. Now, I think that I hear one say, "But these three steps are
   pretty stiff ones--give up the idols, prepare the heart, serve only the
   Lord." Yes, they are, and I do not believe that these people could ever
   have taken these three steps if

   it had not been for my third point, namely, that THEY WERE HELPED TO DO
   ALL THIS BY HAVING FAITH. It

   was faith in Samuel, as we have already noticed. You can be much more
   helped, yes, graciously enabled, if you have faith in Christ!

   They believed Samuel's words. He had spoken to them and they said to
   one another, "Samuel says that God will deliver us from the Philistines
   if we trust Him. Samuel speaks the truth." Well, now, God has sent a
   greater than Samuel-- His Only-Begotten Son--and He says to you that,
   "Whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life."
   You need have no doubt about it--the Word He has spoken shall never be
   broken! He means what He promises and not one jot or tittle of His Word
   shall pass away till all is fulfilled. Believe what Christ says, that
   there is salvation for everyone who puts his trust in Him! Believe that
   and take hope and, getting that hope, be bold to strike the decisive
   blow tonight and give up your idols and turn to God!

   These people believed chiefly in Samuel's prayers. He was a mighty man
   in prayer and when the Philistines came, the children of Israel cried
   to him, saying, "Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us." How
   much greater faith should we put in the Lord Jesus, who died and rose
   again and always lives to plead for us! "Therefore He is able also to
   save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He always
   lives to make intercession for them." Sinners, Christ is praying for
   you! If you trust Him, His prayers will help you to break the fetters
   of sin--

   "The Lion of Judah shall break every chain, And give us the victory
   again and again."

   The people had faith in Samuel's sacrifice, for Samuel took a lamb and
   burnt it whole upon the altar. And our glorious Christ has made Himself
   the Lamb of God and He has been wholly consumed as an offering unto
   God. Trust in His Word! Trust in His prayers! Trust in His Sacrifice!
   Believe that the precious blood can make you white! Believe that there
   is virtue enough in the death of Christ to make atonement for all the
   sin that is confessed and laid before Him! If you believe, the blood of
   Jesus Christ His Son has cleansed you! If you will trust Him, your sin
   is put away. This is the very errand on which He came, "To put away sin
   by the sacrifice of Himself."

   Hear what the Lord has said by the Prophet--"I, even I, am He that
   blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and will not remember
   your sins." "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions,
   and, as a cloud, your sins: return unto Me; for I have redeemed you."
   Believe this and, believing it, you shall be helped to break the idols,
   helped to prepare the heart, helped to come and serve the Lord only!
   Let the prayer go up from your heart to Him who poured out His soul on
   Calvary, but who is now alive and attentive to the voice of our cry, "O
   Lord, I trust in Your Sacrifice, I rely on Your blood! Save me for Your
   name's sake, and cleanse me from my sin."--

   "Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole, I want You fore ver to live
   in my soul. Break down every idol, cast out every foe-- Now wash me and
   I shall be whiter than snow."

   Israel also accepted Samuel's rule--"Samuel judged Israel all the days
   of his life. And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and
   Gilgal, and Mizpeh and judged Israel in all those places." You see,
   salvation means being delivered from the power of sin. Salvation means
   being made a new man--an honest man, a holy man, a gracious man. It
   means that Christ, who saves the soul, begins to govern the life and
   this salvation is to be gained through faith in Jesus Christ. The Lord
   help you to believe in God Incarnate, in God making sacrifice for sin,
   in Jesus dead, buried, risen, ascended, sitting at the right hand of
   God and soon to come in Glory! Let Him enter your life and, dwelling in
   your heart, judge your every action and rule over your entire life.

   I trust that none of you will say, "We will keep our idols." Ah, if you
   do so, you will not keep them long! If your idols are not taken away
   from you, you will be taken away from your idols. What will some of you
   do in the next world when there is no gold to hoard and no revelry in
   which to indulge? When you will have no occupation but to gnash your
   teeth upon yourself because you committed everlasting suicide and
   refused and rejected Christ for a few days' pleasure, or a few years'
   gain? Will any of you be mad enough to let eternity go, let Heaven go
   and let God go for the paltry lusts of the flesh, for the fleeting
   gains of the hour? As I shall confront you at the bar of God, I charge
   you, seek Him! Put away your idols! Prepare your hearts! Trust in Jesus
   and serve only the Lord! God grant that it may be so, for His name's
   sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--1 Samuel 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

The First, Last--And the Last, First

   (No. 2221)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   12, 1891.

   "But many who are first will be last, and the last, first." Matthew
   19:30.

   "So the last will be first, and the first, last." Matthew20:16.

   We must be saved if we would serve the Lord. We cannot serve God in an
   unsaved condition. "They that are in the flesh cannot please God." It
   is vain for them to attempt service while they are still at enmity
   against God. The Lord wants not enemies to wait upon Him, nor slaves to
   grace His Throne. We must first be saved--and salvation is all of
   Grace. "By Grace are you saved through faith." After we are saved and
   as the result of salvation, we serve. Saved--we serve! He that is saved
   becomes a child of God and then he renders a child-like service in his
   Father's house. That service is also all of Grace! He serves not under
   the Law of the old commandment, "This do, and you shall live," for he
   is not under the Law, but under Grace. Therefore, sin shall not have
   dominion over him, but Grace shall have dominion over him-- and he
   shall seek to serve the Lord and please Him all the days of his life.
   When we are saved, we must never forget that we are saved that we may
   serve--made free from sin, that we may become servants of God. David
   says, "O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant and the son
   of Your handmaid: You have loosed my bonds." Because our bonds are
   loosed, we are under new bonds, bonds of love which bind us to the
   service of the Most High.

   Now, when we come thus to be servants, we must not forget that we are
   saved men and women, for if we begin to fancy that while we serve, we
   are working to win life by our merits, we shall get upon legal ground.
   And a child of God on legal ground is going backwards--he is departing
   from his true standing before God. But remember, "You are not under the
   Law, but under Grace." But if you begin to forget your indebtedness to
   your Savior, not only for eternal life, but for everything you are,
   have and do, you will be like the Galatians who began in the Spirit,
   but sought to be made perfect by the flesh. You will be like the young
   man whose question we have just read--"What do I lack?" You will be
   like Peter, who puts in a sort of claim for reward--"Behold, we have
   forsaken all, and followed You; what shall we have therefore?" You will
   be like the men who had worked in the vineyard from early morning and
   who murmured because the penny was given to those who had only worked
   for a single hour.

   Christ will not have His servants under bondage to a legal spirit!
   Wherever He spies it out, He strikes it on the head, for both the
   service and the reward are all of Grace. The service, itself, is given
   us of God and God rewards the service which He, Himself, has given! We
   might almost speak of this as an eccentricity of Grace. God gives us
   good works and then rewards us for the works which He, Himself, has
   given! So all is of Grace from first to last and must never be viewed
   with a legal eye. Into this subject I want, on this occasion, to
   conduct you.

   I dare say that you have heard sermons from this text, but probably not
   preached from it in its connection. I like to take the text as it
   stands and get from it a bit of exposition for my own heart, which I
   may pass on to you, for, remember, although the text away from its
   connection may be true, yet it is not the truth which God there
   intended to teach us and it becomes us to look about us to see what
   comes before the text and what comes after, in order that we may catch
   the exact meaning of the Holy Spirit in giving the words.

   I. I shall begin by dwelling upon this remark--IN THE SERVICE OF OUR
   LORD FREE GRACE IS MANIFESTED. It may not strike you as being upon the
   surface of the text, but it lies on the very surface of the whole
   connection--in the service of our Lord, Free Grace is manifested. Think
   that over.

   It must be so, in the first place, because, although it is rewarded,
   all our service is already due to God. Under the Law of God we are
   bound to love the Lord with all our heart, with all our soul, with all
   our mind and with all our strength. There can be nothing beyond that.
   All that we can do, we are already bound to do under the Law. Works of
   supererogation must be impossible, since the Law comprehends all
   holiness and condemns every form of sin. When we have done all, we are
   unprofitable servants--we have done no more than it was our duty to do.
   Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, if there is a service to which we are
   called, and for which a reward is promised, it must be a service of
   Grace. It cannot be any other. Under the Gospel, the same thing is
   true--all that we can do is already due. "You are not your own; for you
   are bought with a price." There is no faculty, there is no capacity,
   there is no possibility of your nature which is not redeemed and which
   does not belong to Christ by virtue of the ransom price which He has
   paid for it!

   You will gladly and gratefully acknowledge the obligation to do all
   that lies in you for Him who loved you and bought you with His precious
   blood--

   "Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow."

   surely they are all already due to my Lord in repentance and gratitude!
   All the zeal of missionaries, all the patience of martyrs, all the
   faith of confessors, all the holiness of godly men is Christ's by right
   and, therefore, there can be no reward for them, seeing that they are
   already His due! If there is a service for which a reward is given to
   us, it is a service granted to us of Grace, that we may receive Grace
   thereby.

   But, next, there is this reflection--all our services is in itself
   unacceptable. When all comes to all, it is still, in and of itself, a
   thing so mean and poor, so imperfect and defiled, that it could not
   claim any reward! Job was made to feel this in the day of his
   humiliation. He said, "If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me
   perverse. Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
   despise my life." If it were possible for us to stand before God in any
   merit of our own, we feel so certain that we have come short of the
   Glory of God and that in many things we have offended, that we would
   tear off our righteousness from us and throw it away as filthy rags,
   even the best of it! "I count all things but loss," says Paul, "that I
   may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness,
   which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ; the
   righteousness which is of God by faith." If, then, we are so conscious
   of our failures, shortcomings, and transgressions--and if we have to
   cry for mercy even on our holy things and to confess sin in them--how
   can we suppose that any reward that may be given can be otherwise than
   of Grace, seeing that the whole service, itself, must be of Grace?

   Think again. The ability to serve God is the gift of God's Grace. I
   refer not only to mental ability, but to the capacity which men of
   substance have to help the cause of God by their generous gifts. It is
   God who gives the power to get wealth, as it is He who gives the brain
   to think and the mouth to speak. "What have you that you did not
   receive?" If any here present are serving God with gifts and graces, I
   am sure that they must acknowledge that those were given to them. They
   did not win them themselves. Or, if some of them are acquirements, yet
   the power to acquire was given them of Him from whom comes every good
   gift and every perfect gift. Thus the ability to serve God is the gift
   of Grace!

   Beloved, the call to serve God in any special way is also of Grace. If
   we are called to the ministry, remember how Paul puts it--"Unto me, who
   am less than the least of all saints, is this Grace given, that I
   should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ." If
   our kings put upon their coins, "Dei gratia"--kings, by the Grace of
   God--well, well, let them say so--but we can put it on our lives.
   "Sunday school teachers, by the Grace of God." "Street preachers, by
   the Grace of God." "Students in the College, by the Grace of God."
   "Preachers of the Gospel, by the Grace of God." It is God who calls us
   to our several sacred employments! Our ordination, if it is an
   ordination at all, is from that great Shepherd and Bishop of souls who
   went up into a mountain and called unto Him whom He would and made them
   to be His first messengers. Before He left them, He gave them that
   great commission which is still binding upon all His followers, "Go you
   into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature."

   It is of Grace that we are put into any sphere of service! And what a
   Grace it is to be permitted to do anything for Him! His shoelaces we
   are not worthy to unloose! His shoes we are not worthy to bear. Though
   it is a menial's work, it is

   a monarch's work to do anything for Christ! Blessed be His name if He
   will let me be anywhere in His service, though it were but as a
   dishwasher in the kitchen! The kitchen is in the palace and Christ's
   kitchen maids are maids of honor! He that serves God, reigns. To serve
   Him on earth is to be glorified! To serve Him in Heaven will be a part
   of our endless glory. Surely this, then, is by Grace!

   Still further, every opportunity of serving God is a gift of Grace. I
   am sure that when I have been shut out from the pulpit by sickness, I
   have thought it a great Grace from God to be permitted to creep into
   the pulpit once more. When one's hand has been unable to hold a pen, we
   count it a Grace to be able to write, again, some loving words that may
   be blessed to men. I think that it is God's Grace that puts people in
   your way to whom you may speak privately. It is God's Grace that brings
   those children to the Sunday school to you, that you may teach them. If
   we were wide awake, we should see, all day long, opportunities of
   usefulness--and we should be saying, "Blessed be God who puts me, by
   Providence, where I can be of some little service to Him and bring
   forth some fruit to His praise!" It is all of Grace! These Providential
   openings and the spirit and the power to avail ourselves of them, come
   as gifts from God!

   Another thing I know--when you have the call to a work and the
   opportunity, still it is a gift of Grace to be in a right state of mind
   to do your Lord's service. Do you ever feel sluggish and dull? Would
   you not always be so if His Spirit did not quicken you? Are you not
   sometimes frostbitten so that your soul seems like a great iceberg?
   Would the waters ever flow unless the Spirit came with melting power?
   Do you not thank God, dear Brother, that you have had gracious
   occasions in which the Lord has made you like Naphtali, "a hind let
   loose"? When you have given forth goodly words, from whom has come the
   unction? Where did the power come from? You have spoken--ah, that is a
   poor thing! But God has spoken through you--ah, that is a grand thing!
   Is not that wholly the work of Grace? Every tear of sympathy that the
   preacher sheds when he is wooing men to Christ. Every heartthrob and
   all the anguish of his soul when he would gladly compel them to come
   in--the whole bearing and carriage of a Grace-taught minister or
   teacher--all this is of Grace and unto God must be the Glory for it. It
   is not under Law that we are working, for the Law of God provides no
   strength, no tone, no savor. It is Grace that makes us work, for it
   gives us the strength with which to work. "God has spoken once; twice
   have I heard this, that power belongs unto God. Also unto You, O Lord,
   belongs mercy: for You render to every man according to his work." You
   give him strength proportioned to his need and the guidance necessary
   because of the difficulties of his task. Here is Grace! Is it not so?

   You will be sure to join with me in the next point without a single
   objection--success in holy service is wholly of the Lord. If we were so
   wicked as to attribute to ourselves the sowing, and to ourselves the
   watering, apart from Grace, yet we would not dare to attribute to
   ourselves the increase! "I have planted," said Paul. "Apollos watered;
   but God gave the increase." Would a single persuasion of ours prevail
   with man's hard heart if the Holy Spirit did not convince him of sin
   and make him repent? Would the preaching of the Gospel in our poor way
   ever enlighten a single eye if Jesus Christ were not seen in His own
   light? Could we comfort the broken-hearted, could we proclaim liberty
   to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound if
   the Spirit of God were not upon us? Why, if we did make the
   proclamation, would it not fall flat to the ground, apart from the work
   of God, who does all things through us and by us?

   We are laborers together with Him. We lift our hand and God lifts His.
   We speak and He speaks. We would gladly lay hold of men's hearts, but
   He does lay hold of them! We would weep them to Christ, but He brings
   them weeping to Christ and saves them to eternal life! Blessed be His
   name! After many years of prophesying in His name, dare any of us say
   that we have made the dry bones to live? After having long given the
   invitation, do we say that we have persuaded one to come to the wedding
   feast apart from the Lord's Divine working? Do we take any of the glory
   of a saved soul to ourselves? It were treason! It were blasphemy! We
   dare not commit such a sin. Our work, if it succeeds at all--if it is
   worth calling a good work--is all of Grace!

   And if, my dear Friends, any of you are called to suffer for Christ's
   sake, the honor of suffering is a special gift. If you have been
   reviled, if you have lost position, if you have suffered those moderate
   martyrdoms which are possible in a free country like this, then, "Unto
   you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him,
   but also to suffer for His sake." "Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for
   great is your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted they the Prophets
   which were before you." But take no credit to yourself. You are
   elevated to the peerage of suffering--it is your King who brought you
   there. You have His gracious permission to pass through great
   tribulation. That were nothing to you if you had not washed your robes
   and made them white in the blood of the Lamb!

   You owe your patience, your courage, your steadfastness, your all to
   the Spirit of God. You would have long since been carried away by the
   fear of man, which brings a snare--you would have long since been a
   traitor to the Truth of God and to your Lord if He had left you. It is
   your duty to be faithful. When you are faithful, it is not in yourself
   that you are so. He works all our works in us and He must have the
   praise of them. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
   Work it out to the very fullest! Be thorough with it. "For it is God
   which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure." "Be
   you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord."
   God will reward you, but your steadfastness, your diligence, your
   patience--all these are the work of the Grace of God and you know it!
   If you, indeed, possess them, you ascribe them all to Him.

   Now, then, we have established this, I think, beyond all contradiction
   among spiritual men--that in the service of the Lord, Free Grace is
   magnified.

   II. So we take another step and we say, as our second head, THEREFORE
   THE LORD HAS HIS OWN WAY OF

   MEASURING WHAT WE DO. You see that in the case of these persons who had
   toiled in the vineyard, their master measured their work after his own
   fashion. He did not go by the regular way of pay as so much an hour,
   but, inasmuch as it was all of Grace, this great householder made the
   reward to be after his own measure--a penny for one hour and a penny
   for 12 hours! He made the last equal to the first! So shall it be--"The
   last will be first, and the first, last." This is because we are
   dealing here, not with a legal paymaster, but with a God of Grace who
   measures our service, which itself is all of Grace, by His own
   measurement, and not by ours.

   He will reward every worker, but not as we judge. He will do no man any
   injustice, even in the Omnipotence of His Grace. He will be able to say
   to every worker, "Friend, I do you no wrong." He will do no wrong to
   any of His servants, whoever they may be, rest sure of that, but still
   He will reply, "Is it not lawful for Me to do what I will with My own?"
   And He will reward His workers in His own royal, yet gracious way.

   So, then, He will not reward us as according to the time spent, or
   surface covered. Some may be Christians for 30 or 40 years and may
   never be among the first. It is not the length of your service, good as
   that is, that will be God's gain! There may be some who shall come to
   Christ and go home to Heaven in a single year and yet shall bring great
   honor to their Master. It is not the length of time in which you are
   engaged in the lord's service. Neither is it the space that is
   apparently covered. Some seem to do a great deal, skimming over a wide
   surface, but it is not this that the Master measures-- neither by the
   hour, nor yet by the acre. That might be a loyal way of measurement,
   but His gracious way of measurement is not so.

   And He will not measure out the reward according to our ability,
   whether it is mental ability, ability of substance, or ability of
   opportunity, for some of us might come in for a large share and others
   might come in for a very little if this were the rule. But this is not
   the way the Master measures! If to one man He gives the gift of speech,
   to another the great gift of diving deeply into the meaning of His
   Words, to another experience and so on, yet the reward to the persons
   holding these various gifts will not be in proportion to the gifts they
   have, but after quite another rule.

   The reward will not be according to the judgement of men. A Brother has
   served God in his way, and his brethren think much of him and appoint
   him to an office. He is a deacon, or an elder, or, perhaps, he becomes
   a pastor. It is a high reward to be allowed thus to increase our
   opportunities of usefulness, but we shall not, at last, be rewarded
   according to the height of office. That is not the standard in this
   Kingdom where Christ rules.

   Above all, no man shall be measured by his own judgement, otherwise I
   know some friends who would have a very grand reward. They are free
   from sin! They are perfect, they say, but their Master knows, if they
   do not, whether that is true or not. Another says, "I have done this
   and I have done that." But it is not what you say that you have done,
   that will gauge your Master's reward to you. There are some that speak
   very loudly of what they have accomplished. I do not think that their
   brethren, for the most part, think the more of them for thinking so
   much of themselves. I believe that those who have lower opinions of
   their own capacity and usefulness are much more honored in the presence
   of the saints of God. No, our self-judgment, our tall talk, our loud
   profession and so forth, will not be the measure with which we shall be
   rewarded, otherwise those who said, "We have borne the burden and heat
   of the day," would have had twopence, at least, if not three-pence, or,
   perhaps, even a shilling in proportion to those poor creatures whom the
   master made equal to them, though they had only come in at the 11th
   hour!

   Our reward will not be according to the impression made among men. We
   may have made our mark upon our age, neighborhood and surroundings.
   Some men's names will go down to posterity. Others have no fame at all.
   It will be found of some men that their lives are written and
   emblazoned everywhere. Others will live in the little circle of their
   family, but not beyond that narrow range. But God will not measure so.
   The godly housewife, with four or five children trained for God in her
   cottage, may be reckoned of God among the first. And the able speaker
   in his pulpit, who has thousands hanging on his lips, may be reckoned
   of God among the last. God has His own ways of measuring up men's
   works.

   But let me add that we shall not be rewarded even according to our
   success. To some men, success is meted out in large measure--that
   success which really is not their own, but is the fruit of other men's
   labors. A man preaches the Gospel with many tears for years and sees
   little fruit. He dies. Another man, of earnest spirit, follows him and
   gathers in the old man's sheaves. The former man planted; the other man
   entered into his labors. To whom shall the reward be given? The success
   is not due to him who seems to have achieved it. You remember that old
   Romish legend which contains a great truth? There was a brother who
   preached very mightily and who had won many souls to Christ and it was
   revealed to him, one night, in a dream, that in Heaven he would have no
   reward for all that he had done. He asked to whom the reward would go
   and an angel told him that it would go to an old man who used to sit on
   the pulpit stairs and pray for him. Well, it may be so, though it is
   more likely that both would share their Master's praise. We shall not
   be rewarded, however, simply according to our apparent success.

   Neither shall we be put down as one of the last because of no success.
   God intends that some men shall never succeed, according to the rule of
   success that appertains among men, for He sent even His servant Isaiah
   to go and make the people's hearts hard and their ears dull of hearing!
   And He sent Jeremiah to weep over a nation to whom his tears brought no
   repentance and no reformation! He may send you, like Noah, to preach
   for 120 years and never got a soul beside your own family into the ark!
   But if you are faithful, that is well pleasing in His sight. Here lies
   the good pleasure of God. I do not suppose that it will happen that you
   are to do all the plowing and all the sowing and there should never be
   an armful of sheaves for you in all your life--though, if it should be
   thus, and you shall have been, at the last, found faithful to the
   commission that your God has given you, verily, I say unto you, you
   shall have your reward! But the reward is not measured out according to
   man's rule of success.

   Let me tell you what I think is a rule with God. It is a many-branched
   kind of rule. Some men stand first because of their strong desire. Oh,
   they would have saved the people if they could! They would have
   persuaded men to be Christians if they could. They would have laid down
   their lives to do it! They preached their very hearts out in their
   desire for their Hearers' salvation. Their souls ran over at their lips
   while they talked with men. God knows their desires and He takes the
   will for the deed and, "so the last will be first."

   God also measures proportions. The Brother never had more than one
   talent, but he did as much with it as some with ten, yet it did not
   seem to come to much in his eyes. He was always mourning because he was
   so little. He thought that he was like one of those coral insects at
   the bottom of the sea, just making a little bit of coral which never
   came above the waves--but it was part of a great whole that would
   afterwards rise into a fairy island of the sea! Our Lord will measure,
   not according to what a man has not, but according to what a man has.

   And here is one who has little to commend him except his spirit. He
   waits upon God. He is very gracious. He trembles at God's Word. He
   speaks with His whole heart very reverently, very tenderly, desiring
   always to be silent if God would have him silent, and only to speak
   when God would move him to speak. His delight is to do the Lord's will
   and nothing but the Lord's will--and he is quite content to be nothing.
   Indeed, he cries for that--

   "Oh to be nothing, nothing, Only to lie at His feet."

   Now, God may put that man among the first, whereas the self-contained
   man, who works sincerely for God, may, nevertheless, have to go into
   the back rank and be among the last.

   Here is one, again, who, whatever he does, does it with thoroughness.
   He does not attempt many things, but he does one thing. It is all that
   he can do and he throws his whole soul into it and works at it like
   some Eastern artist working at a cameo for a prince. All his life is
   put into that little bit of a thing and, it may be, that our great King
   will count him

   first, while another who did much in a slovenly, slurring style and was
   thought to have done a great deal, will have all his work rejected, for
   it is not up to the Prince's mark and He will not adorn His palace
   therewith.

   I think, dear Friends, that God will measure our work very much by our
   thought of Him in it. If we did it all to Him. If we did it all for
   Him. If He was always in our mind in the doing of it and we did not
   think of our friends, nor of our own reputation, God would be more
   likely to honor us, for He will put those who think much of Him among
   the first, and others among the last. "Them that honor Me," says the
   Lord, "I will honor."

   And especially, again, if all that we do is baptized with love. Why,
   see that woman who brought her alabaster box, and broke it, and poured
   the precious ointment of spikenard upon Christ's head! She is put among
   the first and Christ makes honorable mention of her wherever the Gospel
   is preached! Some that did much have to go among the last, for they had
   not such love as she had.

   Some work for God with great faith--and the Lord loves to see us
   working in faith. To do a great deal of work with a great deal of
   unbelief is to do very little, after all, for if a prayer that is
   unbelieving does not prosper, preaching or teaching that is unbelieving
   is not likely to do so. Put faith into your work and, maybe, you will
   be among the first.

   I am sure that God measures much of our work ac cording to the prayer
   we expend over it. Oh, yes, it was a fine sermon! You could tell how
   the preacher had worked at it--you could see how he had polished up
   that phrase and how he had cut that sentence into dice-pieces to make
   it sound great--but you could also see that he had never prayed over
   it. A sermon that is prayed over is worth 10,000 that are merely
   prepared, or copied, or that spring out of a man's mind without being
   worked by the Holy Spirit in his heart. Oh, to pray down the sermon and
   then to pray up the sermon and pray it all over, resting upon God,
   alone!

   God will often look upon our work in giving, not according to how much
   we give, but I think that the Lord's rule is to take notice of how much
   we have left. That woman who gave all her living, gave more than all
   the rich men gave, because she had nothing left. It was but two mites
   that make a farthing, but then it was all her living and so she goes
   into the front rank! My lord has given a thousand pounds and we are
   very much obliged to him. He must go into the back rank, for all that,
   for he has so much left.

   And then, it may be, that they will take the first place who did not
   get any reward for what they did. Our Lord tells us that when we are
   making a feast, we should call in the blind, and the halt, and the
   lame. Why? "For," He says, "they cannot recompense you." He speaks of
   the Pharisees, again, and says, "Verily I say unto you, They have their
   reward." You will not be paid twice! If you have done something for
   Christ--for instance, defended the faith--and you are denounced for it
   and traduced for it, very well, you have not had your pay for it. There
   remains the recompense for unrewarded services. It is a grand thing
   when, by the Grace of God, you have something standing in God's Book,
   not of law, but of Grace! You helped a poor man and he was not
   grateful. Oh, be so thankful that he was not grateful, because if he
   had been grateful, maybe you would have had your reward!

   When those you relieve are very kind afterwards, and speak well of you,
   and do you some good service in return, it is very nice. Of course it
   is. Well, but you are paid. But those who have done good and suffered
   for it. Those who, for the best thing that they did have had the worst
   return--who have rendered kindness and have only received unkindness as
   the result--it may be that the Lord will say of them, "These were last,
   but they shall be first." Whereas many that stood first in men's esteem
   and in the gratitude they received, will have to go last.

   III. Now, my time almost fails me, but you must bear with me on my
   third head, for here is the practical part of Free Grace in our
   service. Therefore WE HAVE INSTRUCTIONS AS TO OUR SPIRIT AS WORKERS. If
   the work is all of Grace and if God has a way of measuring up that
   work, which is not at all according to the Law, but of His own Grace,
   then there are two things to be observed. First, do not be proud.
   Secondly, do not be discouraged.

   Do not be proud, for many that are first shall be last. Suppose, my
   dear Friend, that you really are first and are doing a great deal for
   God--will you be proud? Why, you are only a greater debtor! You owe all
   the more to that Grace which has enabled you to be of some service in
   the Kingdom of your Lord! Lie low at your Lord's feet and be very
   humble.

   Next, remember that though you may think that you are first, you may,
   even now, be among the last. Your assessment of your service may not be
   the Divine assessment at all. You may think that you are "rich, and
   increased with goods, and have need of nothing," but, in God's repute,
   you may be, "Wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."

   Your work may be like very big trusses of hay, loads of straw and
   stacks of stubble! And yet, when God comes to try it, it may be all
   burned down to a handful of ashes, whereas the friend, of whom you
   think so little, may only have built a small portion, but he has built
   it of gold, silver and precious stones. Let us also remember that, even
   if it is true that we are among the first, we may, if we get proud of
   it, find ourselves among the last. Oh, how some of God's greatest
   servants have been shriveled up when they began to swell out with pride
   and vanity! God blessed them as long as they were feeble, weak and
   leaned upon His strength, but when they were strong and relied on
   themselves, there came a dreadful failure.

   There is one thing which is absolutely certain. If you are among the
   first, you will reckon yourself to be among the last. He that is best,
   thinks himself worst. What a description Paul gives of himself in the
   7th Chapter of Romans! "Oh," says one, "I heard a person say that Paul
   was not a converted man when he wrote that!" Let me tell you that he
   had been in the third Heaven when he wrote that bit of deep experience.
   He had so much likeness to his Lord that he excelled every other man
   then living, except, perhaps, John! And if it had not been for his
   extraordinary holiness, he would never have been able to pen those
   tremendous groanings wherein he says, "O wretched man that I am! Who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death?"

   The man who thinks that he is holy has never seen the holy God. If he
   had--if he had ever beheld Him, he would say with Job, "I have heard of
   You by the hearing of the ear: but now my eyes see You. Therefore I
   abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes." The superlative perfection
   of the Lord God and the absolutely perfect example of our Lord Jesus
   Christ are such that if a man has ever had communion with these, he
   shrinks into nothing in his own esteem! He that is really first is
   always the man who is willing to be accounted last. Paul, though he is
   not a whit behind any of the Apostles, yet calls himself less than the
   least of all saints and describes himself as having been the chief of
   sinners. Ah, Beloved! A low idea of self is one of the labels with
   which God marks the best of His possessions! Therefore, do not be
   proud.

   In the next place, do not be discouraged. If you feel that you are
   last, God's measure is not yours. Though you may think that you are
   last, He may not think so at all. Though you say, "I am not worthy to
   be an Apostle," yet He may think you worth putting into the
   apostleship. God's idea of your worthiness and your own may greatly
   differ--and His estimate is the true one!

   Besides, suppose that you are last, yet "He gives more Grace." Christ
   has come, not only that we may have life, but that we may have it "more
   abundantly." Do not be content with what you have! "Covet earnestly the
   best gifts." Covet still more the best Graces. God is able to do for us
   "exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think." Go in for great
   things. Has not the Lord said, "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill
   it." I spoke to a man of God this morning and I told him how God had
   graciously enabled me to draw near to Him in prayer and of the glorious
   way He had granted my requests. My Friend said, "Yes, and He has made
   your mouth bigger than it used to be." Is it not so? The faculty of
   believing prayer grows by being used! The more you ask, the more you
   may ask and the more you have asked, the more you will ask. The
   capacity to receive is increased by receiving. God grant that it may be
   so with us if we are last!

   Remember, too, that if you really are among the least useful, yet a
   right spirit may compensate for your poverty and make your little
   service very precious. If you cannot get a wide sphere, do not want it.
   A young minister said to an old one, "Ah, Sir, I preach only to about
   100 people. I wish that I could get where I could gather a thousand."
   His friend answered, "Young man, a hundred people are quite enough for
   you to be accountable for. And if you faithfully discharge your duty to
   their souls, you have quite enough to do." Wish for a larger sphere if
   you are capable of filling it, but remember that the best preparation
   for greater usefulness is to be faithful in your present position.

   My last word to God's children is this-- what does it matter, after
   all, whether we are first or whether we are last? Do not let us dwell
   too much upon it, for we all share the honor given to each. When we are
   converted, we become members of Christ's living body. And as we grow in
   Grace and get the true spirit that permeates that body, we shall say,
   when any member of it is honored, "This is honor for us." If any
   Brother shall be greatly honored of God, I feel honored in his honor.
   If God shall bless your Brother and make him 10 times more useful than
   you are, then you see that He is blessing you--not only blessing him,
   but you! If my hand has something in it, my foot does not say, "Oh, I
   have not got it!" No, for if my hand has it, my foot has it--it belongs
   to the whole of my body. If my mouth alone eats, yet it does not eat
   for my mouth, alone, but it eats for my brain, my hand, my
   backbone--for every part of me.

   So, when you get to feel your oneness with Christ, and your oneness
   with His people, your only thought will be, "Let God be glorified; let
   Him be magnified. It does not matter whether I am first or last." You
   will stand up and say, "That

   Brother who was converted only a week or two ago, got his penny and I
   am glad of it." Here is another, who has done very poor work, but you
   will thank God that he got his penny. He is one of the family. It all
   comes from the same hand and it will all come home to the same house.
   We are something like men in a great shop where there are different
   people serving. One young man has a counter where ladies come and he
   serves them--and he takes a lot of money in the day. Another
   counterman, at the back, sells goods that take a deal of trouble to
   dispose of and upon which there is but a trifling profit. Does the
   master praise the men of the shop according to the quantity of money
   each takes? The one who is put in the back place and sells poor goods
   is just as diligent and just as worthy in his master's sight as the
   others! Suppose that they are all members of one family--when they meet
   at night, one will say, "I took in so much." Another will say, "I took
   10 times as much as that," but they are all glad because it all goes
   into the firm--it is all a part of the same concern. Go then, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, and work away for Christ! And do not envy one
   another, but all be glad to be permitted, in this work of Grace, to
   take any part or any portion for your Lord.

   One thing more, and I am done. I have only been talking to God's people
   all this while because you that are not saved cannot serve Him. What a
   miserable position yours is! You are out of the pale of service. God
   will receive nothing of you till you come to Christ. The only way to
   bring sacrifice is to bring it through the great High Priest, the Lord
   Jesus Christ! "Except you be converted, and become as little children,
   you shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven." Much less shall you be
   accepted as servants there. I beseech you, by the thought of the Grace
   of which I have been speaking, to rest not until you can say that
   Christ has saved you, made you a partaker of His Grace and sent you
   forth into His royal service. The Lord bless you! Amen.

Lydia, the First European Convert

   (No. 2222)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple,
   from the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, whose heart the Lord
   opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."
   Acts 16:14.

   We may laudably exercise curiosity with regard to the first
   proclamation of the Gospel in our own quarter of the globe. We are
   happy that history so accurately tells us, by the pen of Luke, when
   first the Gospel was preached in Europe and by whom, and who was the
   first convert brought by that preaching to the Savior's feet. I half
   envy Lydia that she should be the leader of the European band! But I
   feel right glad that a woman led the van and that her household
   followed so closely in the rear.

   God has made great use of women and greatly honored them in the Kingdom
   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Holy women ministered to our Lord
   when He was upon the earth and since that time much sacred work has
   been done by their patient hands. Man and woman fell together--together
   they must rise! After the Resurrection, it was a woman who was first
   commissioned to carry the glad tidings of the risen Christ. And in
   Europe, where woman was, in future days, to be set free from many of
   the trammels of the East, it seems fitting that a woman should be the
   first Believer. Not only, however, was Lydia a sort of first-fruit for
   Europe, but she probably also became a witness in her own city of
   Thyatira, in Asia. We do not know how the Gospel was introduced into
   that city, but we are informed of the existence of a Church there by
   the message of the ascended Christ through His servant, John, to "the
   angel of the Church in Thyatira." Very likely Lydia became the herald
   of the Gospel in her native place. Let the women who know the Truth of
   God proclaim it, for why should their influence be lost? "The Lord
   gives the word; the women that publish the tidings are a great host."
   Woman can be as powerful for evil as for good--we see it in this very
   Church of Thyatira, where the woman Jezebel, who called herself a
   prophetess, sought to seduce many from the Truth. Seeing, then, that
   the devil employs women in his service, let those women whom God has
   called, by His Grace, be doubly earnest in seeking to prevent or undo
   the mischief that others of their sex are working. If not called to
   public service, all have the home-sphere wherein they can shed forth
   the aroma of a godly life and testimony.

   If the Gospel does not influence our homes, it is little likely to make
   headway among the community. God has made family piety to be, as it
   were, a sort of trademark on religion in Europe, for the very first
   convert brings with her all her family! Her household believed and were
   baptized with her. You shall notice in Europe, though I do not mean to
   say that it is not the same anywhere else, that true godliness has
   always flourished in proportion as family religion has been observed.
   They hang a bell in a steeple and they tell us that it is our duty to
   go every morning and every evening into the steeple house, there to
   join in prayer. But we reply that our own house is better for many
   reasons--at any rate, it will not engender superstition for us to pray
   there. Gather your children together and offer prayer and supplication
   to God in your own home!

   "But there is no priest." Then there ought to be! Every man should be a
   priest in his own household and, in the absence of a godly father, the
   mother should lead the devotions! Every house should be the House of
   God and there should be a Church in every house. And when this is the
   case, it will be the greatest barrier against priestcraft and the
   idolatry of holy places. Family prayer and the pulpit are the bulwarks
   of Protestantism! Depend upon it, when family piety goes down, the life
   of godliness will become very low. In Europe, at any rate, seeing that
   the Christian faith began with a con-

   verted household, we ought to seek after the conversion of all our
   families and to maintain within our houses the good and holy practice
   of family worship.

   Lydia, then, is the first European convert, and we will review her
   history as far as we have it in Holy Writ. Towards her conversion, four
   things co-operated, upon which we will speak briefly. First, the
   working of Providence. Secondly, the working of Lydia, herself.
   Thirdly, the working of Paul. And fourthly, the working of the Holy
   Spirit.

   I. First, notice THE WORKING OF PROVIDENCE. When I was in Amsterdam, I
   visited the works of a diamond-cutter where I saw many large wheels and
   much powerful machinery at work. And I must confess that it seemed very
   odd that all that great array of apparatus should be brought to bear
   upon a tiny bit of crystal which looked like a fragment of glass. Was
   that diamond worth so much that a whole factory should be set to work
   to cut its facets and cause it to sparkle? So the diamond-cutter
   believed. Within that small space lay a gem which was thought worthy of
   all this care and labor. That diamond may be, at this time, glistening
   upon the finger or brow of royalty! Now, when I look abroad upon
   Providence, it seems preposterous to believe that kingdoms, dynasties
   and great events should all be co-operating and working together for
   the accomplishment of the Divine purpose in the salvation of God's
   people. But they are so working! It might have seemed preposterous, but
   it was not so, that these great wheels should all be working for the
   cutting of a single diamond. And it is not preposterous, however it may
   seem, to say that all the events of Providence are being ordered by God
   to effect the salvation of His own people, the perfecting of the
   precious jewels which are to adorn the crown of Christ forever and
   ever!

   In the case before us, the working of God's Providence is seen, first
   of all, in bringing Paul to Philippi. Lydia is there. I do not know how
   long she had been there, nor exactly what brought her there, but there
   she is, selling her purple, her Turkey red cloth. Paul must go there,
   too, but he does not want to--he has not, indeed, had any desire to go
   there. He still has a kind of prejudice hanging about him, so that,
   though he is willing to preach to the Gentiles, he scarcely likes to go
   out of Asia among those Gentiles or the Gentiles over in Europe. He
   wants to preach the word in Asia. Very singularly, the Spirit suffers
   him not, and he seems to have a cold hand laid on him to stop him when
   his heart is warmest. He is gagged. He cannot speak. "Then I will go
   into Bithynia," he says, but when he starts on the journey, he is
   distinctly told that there is no work for him to do there. He must not
   speak for his Master in that region, at least not yet--"the Spirit
   suffered him not." He feels himself to be a silenced man. What is he to
   do? He gets down to Troas on the verge of the sea and there comes to
   him the vision of a man of Macedonia who begged him, saying, "Come over
   into Macedonia, and help us." He infers that he must go across to
   Macedonia. A ship is ready for him--he has a free course, a favorable
   passage--and he soon arrives at Philippi. God brings Paul to the spot
   where Lydia was, in this strange and singular manner!

   But the working of Providence was quite as much manifested in bringing
   Lydia there, for Lydia was not originally at Philippi. She was a seller
   of purple, of Thyatira. Thyatira was a city famous for its dyers. They
   made a peculiar purple which was much prized by the Romans. Lydia
   appears to have carried on this business. She was either a widow, or
   perhaps had had no husband, though she may have gathered a household of
   servants about her. She comes over to Philippi across the sea. I think
   I see them bringing the great rolls of red cloth up the hill, that she
   may sell at Philippi the cloth which she has made and dyed at Thyatira.
   Why does she come just at this season? Why does she come just when Paul
   is coming? Why does she come to Philippi? Why not to Neapolis? Why not
   press on to Athens? Why not sell her cloth over at Corinth? Whatever
   reason she might have given for her choice, there was one cause of
   which she was ignorant, which shaped her action and brought her to
   Philippi at that time!

   God had a surprise in store for her. She and Paul have to meet. It does
   not matter what their will is--their wills shall be so moved and
   actuated by the Providence of God that they shall cross each other's
   path--and Paul shall preach the Gospel to Lydia. I know it never
   entered into Lydia's heart, when she left Thyatira with her purple
   bales, that she was going to find Jesus Christ over at Philippi.
   Neither did Paul guess, when he saw, in a vision, a man of Macedonia
   and heard him say, "Come over into Macedonia, and help us," that the
   first person he would have to help would not be a man of Macedonia at
   all, but a woman of Thyatira and that the congregation he should preach
   to would be just a handful of women gathered by the side of the little
   stream that runs through Philippi! Neither Paul nor Lydia knew what God
   was about to do, but God knew! He understands the end from the
   beginning and times His acts of Providence to meet our deepest needs in
   the wisest way--

   "His wisdom is sublime, His heart profoundly kind.

   God never is before His time, And never is behind."

   What an odd thing it seemed that this woman should be a woman of
   Thyatira in Asia--and Paul must not go and preach in Asia and yet, when
   he comes to Macedonia, the first person who hears him is a woman of
   Asia! Why, you and I would have said, "If the woman belongs to
   Thyatira, let her stay at home and let Paul go there, that is the
   shortest cut." Not so. The woman of Thyatira must go to Philippi and
   Paul must go to Philippi, too. This is God's plan and if we knew all
   the circumstances as God knows them, we would doubtless admire the
   wisdom of it. Perhaps the very peculiarity of the circumstances made
   Paul more alert to seize the opportunity at Philippi than he would have
   been had he gone on to Thyatira. Perhaps the isolation of the strange
   city made Lydia yearn more after spiritual things. God can answer a
   dozen ends by one act!

   One of our evangelists tells of a man who was converted in a small
   Irish town and it was afterwards discovered that he and the preacher
   who led him to Christ, resided but a few hundred yards from each other
   in London! They had never met in this great city, where neighbors are
   strangers to each other, nor was it likely that they ever would have
   been brought into contact with one another here, for the man, who was a
   commercial traveler, was too careless to ever attend a place of worship
   in London. But to sell his goods, he went to Ireland, where, also, went
   the evangelist to preach the Gospel! And being somewhat at a loss to
   know what to do with his time, he no sooner saw the name of a preacher
   from London announced than he determined to attend the service--and
   there he met with Christ! We can see how natural this was in the case
   of which we know all the particulars--and it was doubtless as well
   arranged in the case of Lydia and

   Paul.

   Now, I should not wonder tonight if there are a number of Providences
   that have worked together to bring some of my hearers into their places
   at this time. What brought you to London, Friend? It was not your
   intention to be in this city. Coming to London, what brought you to
   this part of it? What led you to be at this service? And why was it
   that you did not come on one of the Sundays when the preacher would
   have been here if he could, but could not be here by reason of his
   weakness? It may be that only from these lips can the Word of God come
   to you--and only tonight--and you must come to this place! Perhaps
   there is someone who preaches the Gospel much better in the town where
   you live. Or, perhaps, you have had opportunities of hearing the same
   preachers near your own door, and you did not avail yourself of them.
   And yet God has brought you here. I wish we watched Providences more.
   "Who is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand
   the loving kindness of the Lord." If the Lord should meet with you and
   convert you tonight, I will guarantee you that you will be a believer
   in Providence, and say, "Yes, God guided my steps. He directed my path
   and He brought me to the spot where Jesus met with me and opened my
   heart that I might receive the Gospel of

   His Grace."

   Be of good courage, you ministers of the Gospel! Providence is always
   working with you while you are working for God. I have often admired
   the language of Mohammed, when, in the battle of Ohod, he said to his
   followers, pointing to their foes, "Charge them! I can hear the wings
   of the angels as they hasten to our help." That was a delusion on his
   part, for he and his men were badly beaten, but it is no delusion in
   the case of the servants of Christ! We can hear the wings of the
   angels! We may hear the grinding of the great wheels of Providence as
   they revolve for the help of the preacher of the Gospel. Everything is
   with us when we are with God. Who can be against us? The stars in their
   courses fight for the servants of God! And all things, great and small,
   shall bow before the feet of Him who trod the waves of the Sea of
   Galilee and still is Master of all things and rules all things to the
   accomplishment of His Divine purposes!

   So much, then, for the working of Providence.

   II. The next thing is, THE WORKING OF LYDIA. God's intention is that
   Lydia shall be saved. Yet, you know, no woman was ever saved against
   her will. God makes us willing in the day of His power and it is the
   way of His Grace not to violate the will, but sweetly to overcome it.
   Never will there be anybody dragged to Heaven by the ears--depend upon
   that! We shall go there with all our hearts and all our desires. What,
   then, was Lydia doing?

   Having, by God's Grace, been made willing, the first thing was that she
   kept the Sabbath. She was a proselyte and she kept the seventh day. She
   was away from Thyatira and nobody would know what she would do, yet she
   observed the Lord's-Day carefully. She was abroad when she was at
   Philippi, but she had not left God behind her. I have known some

   English people, when they once reached the Continent, go rattling
   along, Sundays and weekdays, as if God did not live on the Continent
   and, as if at home they only observed the Sabbath because they happened
   to be in England, which is very probably the case with a good many.
   When they get away, they say, "When you are at Rome, you must do as
   Rome does." And so they take their pleasure on God's day. It was not so
   with Lydia. There was no selling of purple that day-- she regarded the
   Sabbath. Oh, I would to God that everyone would regard the Sabbath! May
   God grant that it may never be taken away from us! There is a plot now
   to make some of you work all the seven days of the week--and you will
   not get any more pay for seven days than you get for six. Stand out
   against it and preserve your right to rest upon the Lord's Day! The
   observance of one day in seven as a day of rest materially helps
   towards the conversion of men because then they are inclined to think.
   They have the opportunity to hear and, if they choose to avail
   themselves of it, the probabilities are that God will bless the hearing
   and they will be saved!

   Now, notice next that not only did Lydia observe the Sabbath, but she
   went up to the place of worship. It was not a very fine place. I do not
   suppose there was any building. It may have been a little temporary
   oratory put up by the river side, but very probably it was just on the
   bank of the river that they met together. It does not appear that there
   were any men, but only a few women. They only held a Prayer
   Meeting--"where prayer was known to be made." But Lydia did not stay
   away from the gathering. She might easily have excused herself after
   her long journey and the wearying work of setting up a new
   establishment, but her heart was in this matter and so she found it no
   drudgery to meet where prayer was offered. She did not say "I can read
   a sermon at home," or, "I can read in the Book of the Law indoors." She
   wished to be where God's people were, however few, or however poor they
   might be. She did not go to the gorgeous heathen temple at Philippi,
   but she sought out the few faithful ones that met to worship the true
   God.

   Now, dear Friends, do the same! You that are not converted, still
   attend the means of Grace and do not go to a place simply because it is
   a fine building, or because there is a crowd, but go where they are
   truly worshipping God in spirit and in truth. If they should happen to
   be very few and very poor, yet go with them, for in so doing you are in
   the way of blessing. I think you will yet have to say, "Being in the
   way, God met with me." If it is what some call, "only a Prayer
   Meeting," you will do well to go. Some of the best blessings that men
   have ever gained have been received at Prayer Meetings. If we would
   meet with God, let us seek Him diligently, "not forsaking the
   assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is." Though you
   cannot save yourself, or open your own heart, you can at least do what
   Lydia did-- observe the Sabbath and gather together with God's people.

   Lydia, being there with the assembly, when Paul began to speak, we find
   that she attended to the things that were spoken, which is another
   thing that we can do. It is very ill when people come up to the House
   of God and do not attend. I have never had to complain of people not
   attending in this house since the day I first preached in it, but I
   have been in places of worship where there seemed to be anything but
   attention. How can it be expected that there will be a blessing when
   the pew becomes a place to sleep, or when the mind is thinking about
   the farm, or in the kitchen, or in the shop, forgetting altogether the
   Gospel which is being preached to the outward ear? If you want a
   blessing, attend with all your might to the Word of God that is
   preached--and of that we will speak more, by-and-by.

   So far we have spoken upon the working of Providence and the working of
   Lydia.

   III. Now, next, THE WORKING OF PAUL, for this, too, was necessary. In
   order to the conversion of men, it is necessary that the person who
   aims at their conversion should work as if it all depended upon him,
   though he knows that he cannot accomplish the work! We are to seek to
   win souls with as much earnestness, prudence and zeal, as if everything
   depended upon ourselves--and then we are to leave all with God, knowing
   that none but the Lord can save a single soul.

   Now, notice, Paul, wishing for converts, is judicious in the choice of
   the place where he will go to look after them. He goes to the spot
   where there should be a synagogue. He thinks that where people have a
   desire to pray, there he will find the kind of people who will be ready
   to hear the Word. So he selects devout people, devout worshippers of
   the one God, that he may go and speak to them about Christ. It is
   sometimes our plain duty to publish the Word from the housetop to the
   careless crowd, but I think you will generally find that more success
   comes when those on whose hearts the Spirit of God has already begun to
   work, are sought out and instructed. When Christ sent out His disciples
   on their first journey, He told them, when they entered a town, to,
   "Enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till you go thence,"
   evidently showing that even among those who do not know the Truth of
   God, there are some whose hearts are prepared to receive it, who are of
   a devout spirit and in that sense are worthy.

   These are the people who should first be sought after. In the same
   limited sense was Cornelius, to whom Peter was sent, worthy to hear the
   glad tidings of great joy. His reverent spirit was well pleasing to
   God, for we read, "Your prayer is heard and your alms are had in
   remembrance in the sight of God." We must not, of course, think that
   these things give any claim to salvation, but rather that they are the
   expression of hearts prepared to receive the message of salvation,
   seeking the Lord, "if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him."
   One of our greatest difficulties in these days is that so many have
   lost all reverence for authority of any kind, even God's--having risen
   against human despotism, they also foolishly try to break God's bands
   asunder! We are cast back on the infinite power of God when we come to
   deal with such people, but when we meet with others who are willing to
   listen and pray, we know that God has already begun to work. Now, dear
   Worker, choose the person who is evidently pointed out to you by God's
   gracious Providence. Choose judiciously and try to speak with those
   with whom you may hopefully speak--and trust that God will bless the
   Word.

   When Paul goes down to the river, you notice that he is very judicious
   as to his manner of introducing his subject. He did not preach at all.
   He found only a few women--and to stand up and preach to them, as he
   did to the crowds at Corinth, or at Athens--might have seemed absurd.
   But we read this--"We sat down and spoke unto the women which resorted
   there." He took his seat on the river's bank where they were all
   sitting still at prayer. And he began just to have a talk. A sermon
   would have been out of place, but a talk was the right sort of thing.
   So he talked the Gospel into them. Now, be careful of the way in which
   you go to work with people, for much of the result must depend upon
   that. Some people can be preached right away from Christ, for the
   moment you begin to preach they say, "Oh, thank you, I do not need any
   of your sermon!" Perhaps you could slip a word in edgewise. Just drop a
   seed in a crack, or leave a word with them, just one word. Say at once,
   "If you do not need any preaching, I do not need to preach to you. I am
   not so fond of preaching as all that, but I read a very curious story
   in the newspapers the other day!" And then tell the story and wrap the
   Gospel up in it. If they do not want pills, do not give them pills.
   Give them a bit of sugar! They will take the sugar and when they get
   it, there will be a pill inside. I mention this because we may miss
   opportunities of doing good through not being wide awake. "Be you wise
   as serpents, and harmless as doves." Paul, therefore, just sat down and
   had a friendly talk with the women who were there.

   But whether Paul preached, or whether Paul talked, it was all the
   same--he was judicious as to the matter of his discourse. He had but
   one subject and that was Christ--the Christ who had met him on the way
   to Damascus and changed his heart--the Christ who was still able to
   save! His Subject was the Christ who bled upon the Cross to bring men
   to God and cleanse them in His blood. The Christ in Heaven, interceding
   for sinners. The Christ waiting to be gracious. Paul would not end his
   talk without saying, "Trust Him. Trust Him. He that believes in Him has
   everlasting life." So, whether he preached or whether he talked, it was
   the same story of Jesus Christ and Him Crucified. That is how Paul
   worked. He might have acted very differently. If his heart had not been
   all aflame for Jesus, he would very likely not have spoken at all, or
   if he had, it would have been a commonplace remark about the weather.

   He might have been eager to learn the method by which the beautiful
   purple dye was obtained and not have remembered that Gospel message,
   written long ago by Isaiah, which would come with special force to the
   hearts of his hear-ers--"Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool." He might have been so interested in his enquiries about Thyatira
   as to forget to speak of the way to the City of Light. A dozen subjects
   might have claimed his attention if his heart had not been set upon one
   Subject! He could have spoken of his journeys and even of his plans
   without actually preaching Christ to them. He might have spoken about
   the Gospel, as I fear we often do, and not have spoken the Gospel,
   itself.

   Some sermons which I have heard, though faultlessly orthodox, have
   contained nothing that could convert any-body--for there has been
   nothing to touch the conscience or heart. Others, though very clever
   and profound, have had no possible bearing on the needs of the hearers
   and so it was little wonder that they were without result. But I am
   sure Paul's talk would aim straight at the center of the target--it was
   evidently addressed to the heart, for we are told that Lydia heard it
   with the heart. After all, it is not our most orderly discourses, nor
   our most apt illustrations which bring people to Christ--but some
   little sentence which is slipped in unawares, or some burning word
   which comes straight out of our own heart's experience. There would be
   sure to be many such that day in that earnest simple talk by the side
   of the river. Let us multiply such conversations if we would win more
   Lydias for the our Master's Church!

   IV. But, now, fourthly--and here is the main point--let us notice THE
   WORKING OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. Providence brings Paul and Lydia
   together. Lydia comes there because she observes the Sabbath and loves
   the place of worship. Paul comes there because he loves to win souls
   and, like his Master, is on the watch for stray sheep. But it would
   have been a poor meeting for them if the Spirit of God had not also
   been there! So we next read of Lydia, "Whose heart the Lord opened,
   that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul." It is not
   amazing that the Lord can open a human heart, for He who made the lock
   knows well what key will fit it!

   What means He made use of in the case of Lydia, I do not know, but I
   will tell you what might have happened. Perhaps she had lost her
   husband--many a woman's heart has been opened by that great gash. The
   joy of her soul has been taken away and she has turned to God. Perhaps
   her husband was spared her, but she had lost a child. Oh, how many a
   babe has been sent here on purpose to entice its mother to the skies! A
   lamb taken away that the sheep might follow the Shepherd! Perhaps she
   had had bad trade--the price of purple may have fallen. She may have
   been half afraid she would fail in business. I have known such trouble
   open some people's hearts. Perhaps she had had prosperity. Possibly the
   purple had gone up in price. I have known some so impressed with God's
   temporal blessings that they have been ready to think of Him and turn
   to Him. I do not know. I cannot guess and I have no right to guess what
   it was.

   But I know that God has very wonderful plows with which He breaks up
   the hard soil of human hearts. When I have been through the Britannia
   Iron Works, at Bedford, I have wondered at the strange clod-crushers,
   clod-breakers and plows made there by the Messrs. Howard--and God has
   some marvelous machines in His Providence for turning up the soil of
   our hearts. I cannot tell what He has done to you, dear Friend, but I
   trust that whatever has happened has been opening the soil so that the
   Good Seed may drop in. It was the Spirit of God who did it, whatever
   the instrument may have been, and Lydia's heart was "opened." Opened to
   what? To attend. "She attended unto the things which were spoken of
   Paul."

   So, first, her heart was opened to listen very intently. She wanted to
   catch every word. She did as some of you do, put her hand to her ear,
   for fear she should not hear all that was spoken. There are many ways
   of listening. Some people listen with both their ears, allowing it to
   go in one ear and out the other, like that wit, who, when he was being
   seriously spoken to, yet seemed very inattentive. At last wearied, the
   friend who was discoursing, said, "I am afraid it is not doing you much
   good." "No," came the reply, "but I think it will do this gentleman
   some good," pointing to one who sat beside him, "for as it has gone in
   at this side, it has gone out at the other." Oh, how I wish that you
   had only one ear, so that the Truth of God you hear could never get out
   after it had once got in! Well did the Lord speak through Isaiah the
   Prophet unto the people, "Hearken diligently unto me and eat that which
   is good." Many people can listen for an hour or two to a scientific
   lecture, or a political speech, without feeling in the least weary.
   They can even go to the theater and sit there a whole evening without
   dreaming of being tired! Yet they complain if the sermon is a minute
   beyond the appointed time! They seem to endure the preaching as a sort
   of penance, scarcely hearing the words, or, at least, never imagining
   that the message can have any application to their own case.

   Lydia's heart was so opened "that she attended," that is, she listened
   to the Word of Salvation until she began to desire it. It is always a
   pleasure to entertain guests who relish the food placed before them and
   it is a great joy to preach to those who are eagerly hungering after
   the Truth of God. But how heart-breaking a task it is to keep
   continually praising the pearl of great price to those who know not its
   value, nor desire its beauty! Daniel was a man, "greatly beloved"--the
   Hebrew word means, "a man of desires." He was not one of your
   conceited, self-satisfied individuals. He longed and yearned for better
   things than he had yet attained and, therefore, was, "greatly beloved."
   God loves people to thirst after Him and to desire to know His love and
   power. Let us explain the Gospel as we may, if there is no desire in
   the heart, our most plain messages are lost! A man said, about
   something he wished to make clear, "Why, it is as plain as A B C!"
   "Yes," said a third party, "but the man you are talking to is D E F."
   So, some of our hearers seem to turn away from the Word of God. But
   when a person says, "I need to find salvation. I need to get Christ
   this very day and I am going to listen with the determination that I
   will find out the way of salvation," surely, if the things spoken are
   the same things that Paul spoke of, few in that condition will go out
   of the house without finding salvation! Lydia's heart was opened to
   attend to the Gospel, that is, to desire it.

   But, next, her heart was opened to understand it. It is amazing how
   little, even well-educated people sometimes understand of the Gospel
   when it is preached in the simplest manner. One is constantly being
   astounded by the misappre-

   hensions that persons have as to the way of salvation. But Lydia had
   grasped the Truth. "Thanks be to God," she said, "I see it! Jesus
   Christ suffered in our place and we, by an act of faith, accept Him as
   our Substitute, and we are saved thereby. I have it! I never saw it
   before. I read about a Paschal lamb and the sprinkling of the blood,
   and the passing over of the houses where the blood was sprinkled. I
   could not quite make it out. Now I see! If the blood if sprinkled upon
   me, God will pass over me, according to His Word, 'When I see the
   blood, I will pass over you.'" She attended unto the things which were
   spoken of Paul, so as to understand them.

   But more than that. Her heart was so opened that she attended to the
   Gospel so as to accept it. "Ah," she said, "now I understand it, I will
   have it. Christ for me! Christ for me! That blessed Substitute for
   sinners! Is that all I have to do, simply to trust Him? Then I will
   trust Him. Sink or swim, I will cast myself upon Him right now." She
   did so then and there! There was no hesitating. She believed what Paul
   said--that Jesus was the Son of God, the appointed Propitiation for sin
   and that whoever believed in Him should, then and there, be
   justified--and she did believe in Him--and she was justified, as you
   will be, my Friend, if you will believe in Him at this moment! You,
   too, shall have immediate salvation, my dear Sister sitting yonder, if
   you will come, like this Lydia of old, and just take Christ to be yours
   and trust Him now! She attended unto the things which were spoken by
   Paul, so that she accepted Christ.

   Having done that, she went further--her heart was so won, that she was,
   by the Spirit, led to obey the Word and confess her faith. Paul told
   her that the Gospel was this--"He that believes and is baptized shall
   be saved." He said to her, "My commission is, 'Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved.'" Perhaps she said, "But why must I be
   baptized?" He said, "As a testimony of your obedience to Christ, whom
   you take to be your Master and your Lord. And as a type of your being
   one with Him in His burial, you are to be buried in water as He was
   buried in the tomb of Joseph. And you are to be raised up out of the
   water even as He rose again from the dead. This act is to be a token
   and type to you of your oneness with Him in His death and burial and
   resurrection."

   What did Lydia say? Did she say, "Well, I think I must wait a little
   while--the water is cold"? Did she say, "I think I must ask about it. I
   must consider it"? No, not at all. Paul tells her that this is Christ's
   ordinance and she at once replies, "Here I am, Paul, let me be baptized
   and my servants, too, and all who belong to my household, for they,
   also, believe in Jesus Christ! Let us have the Baptism at once." Then
   and there, "she was baptized, and her household." She did at once obey
   the heavenly message and she became a baptized Believer. She was not
   ashamed to confess Christ! She had not known Him long, but what she did
   know of Him was so blessed and joyous to her soul that she would have
   sung, if she had known the hymn--

   "Through floods and flames, if Jesus lead, I'll follow where He goes!
   'Hinder me not,' shall be my cry, Though earth and Hell oppose."

   You can imagine her saying, "Did He go down into the Jordan and say,
   'Thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness'? Then I will go where
   He leads the way and be obedient to Him and say to all the world, 'I,
   too, am a follower of the Crucified Christ.'"

   Now, lastly, after Lydia was baptized, she became an enthusiastic
   Christian. She said to Paul, "You must come home with me. I know you
   have not anywhere to go. Come along. And there is your friend, Silas. I
   have plenty of room for him and Timothy, too, and also Luke. We can
   make room for the four of you among the purple bales, or somewhere,
   but, at any rate, I have house-room for you four and I have heart-room
   for 40,000 of you! I wish I could take in the whole Church of God."
   Dear good woman that she was, she felt that she could not do too much
   for the men who had been made a blessing to her, for she regarded what
   she did to them as done to their Lord and Master! They might have said,
   "No, really, we cannot trouble you. You have the household. You have
   all this business to look after." "Yes," she would answer, "I know
   that. It is very kind of you to excuse yourselves, but you must come."

   "No," Paul might urge, "my dear good woman, I am going to find some
   tent-makers and make tents with them. We will find a lodging where we
   find work." "Ah!" she would say, "but I mean to have you. You must come
   to my home." "She constrained us." She would probably put it thus,
   "Now, I shall not think that you fully believe in me if you do not come
   home with me. Come, you baptized me, and by that very act you professed
   that you considered that I was a true

   Believer. If you really believe it, come and stay in my house as long
   as you like and I will make you as comfortable as ever I can."

   So, at last, Paul yields to her constraint and goes to her home. How
   glad they would all be, and what praise to Christ would rise from that
   household! I hope that the generous spirit which glowed in the heart of
   the first convert in Europe will always continue among the converts of
   Europe till the last day! I trust that when they are called not merely
   to entertain God's ministers, but to help all God's people of every
   sort, they may be ready and willing to do it for Christ's sake, for
   love shall fill them with a holy hospitality and an earnest desire to
   bless the children of God. Love one another, Brothers and Sisters, and
   do good to one another, as you have opportunity--for so will you be
   worthy followers of Lydia, the first European convert, whose heart the
   Lord opened!

   The Lord open your hearts, for His name's sake! Amen.

Abraham's Trial--a Lesson for Believers

   (No. 2223)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 12, 1891.

   "And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham,
   and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am." Genesis
   22:1.

   WE may regard the father of the faithful as being a pattern of his
   children. As God dealt with Abraham, so will He deal in measure with
   all those who, as Believers, are the children of believing Abraham.
   Everything that will abide the fire shall go through the fire, that it
   may be both proved and improved. We clearly understand that when God is
   said to "tempt" Abraham, the word used does not carry its ordinary
   meaning. "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
   God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts He any man." But
   Jehovah is accustomed to try and test His people and this is what we
   are here to understand. The Revised Version renders the words, "God did
   prove Abraham" and, as I have said, God works by the same method with
   all His saints.

   Of course, we shall not all attain to the same stature that Abraham
   reached, neither shall we all be tried by the same tests that were
   applied to him, but every one of us shall be tested, like Abraham, if,
   indeed, we are Believers in God. He was the Columbus who, by faith,
   went out and discovered a better country, that is, a heavenly--and his
   track has been followed by many other voyagers. Not without storms did
   he cross the sea and we, too, who venture after him on the voyage of
   faith, must expect to meet with contrary winds and waves sweeping high.
   We may look for a considerable measure of conformity in our lives to
   the life of the great Patriarch and we must not be astonished, as
   though some strange thing had happened to us, if great and severe tests
   should be put upon us before the chapter of life is over.

   None of us ought to object to this. Shall the child of faith be
   otherwise than the father of the faithful? I may say of Abraham what
   our Lord said of Himself--"The disciple is not above his master, nor
   the servant above his lord." Shall the Believer, saved and justified by
   faith, as Abraham was, rebel against sharing in Abraham's lot? We shall
   sit down, by-and-by, at the same table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in
   the Kingdom of our God. Surely we may be content to fare on the road as
   they fared. In fact, I hope you will say, concerning Abraham, "Where
   you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall
   be my people and your God my God." We are willing to take the portion
   of the righteous. We will not say, with wretched Balaam, "Let me die
   the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!" We would
   have a far better desire than that--"May my way be the way of the
   righteous, that my end may be like his! May I have a portion with Your
   people, O God: and do You deal with me as You do with all those who
   love Your name!"

   Let us look at our text. It is a kind of preface to this unique, this
   unparalleled story of Abraham's test. First, "It came to pass after
   these things, that God did tempt (or "prove") Abraham"--here we see the
   Lord's way with Believers. And, secondly, when God, "said unto him,
   Abraham," the Patriarch instantly answered, "Behold, here I am"--here
   we learn the Believer's way with the Lord. These two heads will not be
   difficult to remember--the Lord's way with Believers and the Believer's
   way with the Lord.

   I. First, THE LORD'S WAY WITH BELIEVERS. He deals with His own people
   as He does not with the world. To be loved by God with the love He
   bears to His chosen is a wonderful honor, but it carries with it the
   Father's authority. "Whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges
   every son whom He receives." All disciples are subject to this blessed
   discipline.

   First of all, then, let us notice that God does deal with His people,
   He is never far away from them. He leaves them not to themselves, but
   is always near those who are truly His. God did test Abraham. It is a
   great thing that God should take any notice of us, poor creatures that
   we are. "When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the
   noon and the stars which You have ordained; what is man, that You are
   mindful of him? And the son of man, that You visit him?" Job wondered
   that God dealt with him in the way of affliction, for he says, "Am I a
   sea, or a whale, that You set a watch over me?" We are so insignificant
   that it is a great wonder that God should come to deal with us at all.
   If you saw some tall archangel, whose wand might make a mast for some
   great man-of-war, bending down over an ant's hill, or talking with an
   ant, you might wonder at his stoop. But this would be nothing compared
   with the infinite God, the Maker of all things, condescending to deal
   with us worms of the earth! Yet He does so. We are precious in His
   sight, therefore, as the goldsmith assays the metal, as the silversmith
   refines the silver again and again in a furnace of earth, so does God
   test, purify and try us--He sets a high value upon us and, therefore,
   He tests us. O child of God, be glad that God comes near you! I would
   sooner feel His hand heavy upon me than be forgotten of Him! I would
   rather see His face wreathed in frowns than never see Him at all! Oh,
   what an awful thing it will be for those who will be cast away from
   Him! To hear Him say, "Depart," will be like an infinity of
   wretchedness. But if He even calls us to Him that He may chasten us,
   His voice has music in it! Lord, blessed be Your name, You think upon
   Your servants! You think upon them even when You chasten them and when
   You test them--for this we would bless Your holy name.

   Notice, next, that God not only deals with Believers very intimately,
   but He tests them. "God did tempt Abraham." "God did prove Abraham."
   Abraham was a man whose life gave good evidence of his faith in
   Jehovah, but the Lord is a jealous God and He loves to have still more
   evidence of the fidelity of His people. He hungers after clear proofs
   from them that they really are His--and He works in them, by His Grace,
   until He casts out all other loves and all other confidences that He
   may have the whole of their hearts--and that they may love Him and
   trust Him supremely.

   Some of you have nothing to do with my text tonight. God does not test
   you because He knows very well what you are and He knows that you are
   not precious metal. The spurious coin is nailed down on the counter, or
   cast into the fire--and they that are not true people of God and have
   none of the silver of Grace in them will come to such an end one day
   and be, with shame and everlasting contempt--nailed down on the counter
   as counterfeits, or thrown into the fire that never shall be quenched!
   "Reprobate silver shall men call them because the Lord has rejected
   them." It is the true coin that we try and test--and God, because He
   loved Abraham, valued him and saw His Grace in him, tested him.

   He tested, first of all, his fear of God. That was the main point, as
   you will see in the 12th verse--"Now I know that you fear God." The
   Lord delights in a man who has a holy reverence for his God. I do not
   hesitate to say that this is a very scarce article nowadays. When I
   hear of one saying that he has received "a straight tip" from God, I
   feel that a man capable of speaking in such a manner was never spoken
   to by the Infinite Jehovah! Communion with God bows a man to the dust
   and causes him to use lowly and reverent language. No, God never comes
   near to us and then leaves us in a frame of mind in which we could
   speak flippantly or irreverently of Him!

   When I hear professing Christians arraigning God's conduct and setting
   up to criticize God's Word, I stand in doubt of them. O Sirs, God's
   true children tremble at His Word--they never question Him! "Why do you
   strive against Him? For He gives not account of any of His matters."
   "Who are you that replies against God?" The spirit of criticism is
   altogether alien to the spirit of the child of God! It is not what they
   say in their criticism that I care about. It is the spirit that dares
   to say it that is the evil thing. The Lord will try each one of us
   whether we really fear Him or not--and if the test is not so severe as
   that which Abraham was called to endure, still the test will come. If
   we say, "No, I cannot do that. I am afraid of the consequences," that
   shows that we do not fear God enough, for the man who fears God fears
   nothing else. The path of duty made clear, he says, "I must do it, cost
   what it may, for it would be infinitely more costly not to do it." His
   fear of God ejects all fear of men and all fear of consequences--it is
   the backbone of all real holiness and all true godliness. And God tries
   us to see whether we have this holy awe of Him and leads us to follow
   in the steps of Abraham, His friend.

   God also tried Abraham's faith. Could he believe that God was right
   when He commanded him to slay his son? All the promises were wrapped up
   in Isaac! If Isaac dies, how can Abraham have a seed? He had been told,
   "In Isaac shall your seed be called," not in Ishmael! What, then, if
   Isaac shall die? All hope of a seed must pass away. How can it be? But
   it was not any matter of question with Abraham. "He staggered not at
   the promise of God through unbelief." You know

   what a man does when he staggers. Perhaps he does not go quite down,
   but he can hardly keep his feet. Abraham was never in that condition.
   He believed God and, therefore, he stood firm. His faith was able to
   face difficulties and to surmount them. When the promise of the birth
   of Isaac was given, we read that, "being not weak in faith, he
   considered not his own body now dead."

   This was, indeed, a triumph of trust--but he went further than that.
   The Revised Version shows that he fully faced the difficulty and yet
   believed as much as ever. "Without being weakened in faith he
   considered his own body now as good as dead." The faith that was
   undismayed when the promise of a son was uttered was still undaunted
   when the Lord demanded the life that He had so strangely given. Perhaps
   God gave such a supreme test because of its very grandeur. The trial
   was terrible, but still, Abraham believed. Possibly he did not
   understand the trial--he did not need to understand. He believed and he
   took God at His word and he would do what God bade him do, whatever
   that might be. He would leave the Lord to extricate him out of any
   difficulties into which his obedience might bring him. Thus God tried
   his faith.

   Above all, God tried Abraham's love. It may be that Isaac, though a
   gift from God, began to usurp God's place. An Isaac may became an idol.
   The dearest thing we have, the most precious, the most beloved, may
   still become an abomination by being made an idol to keep us away from
   God. Some of the heathen worship gods of mud, others worship gods of
   gold, but there is no difference in the idolatry, whether the image is
   made of mud or of the most precious metal. Have you any idols, dear
   Friends? I will not press the question too closely, but whatever your
   idols may be, they will bring you a world of trouble, for you must love
   nothing in comparison with God. He must be first and everything else
   far away in the background. He will endure no rivals. He will permit no
   Dagon to stand in the place where the Ark of the Covenant abides. So
   God tests Abraham to see which has most of his heart's love--Jehovah
   who gave Him Isaac--or Isaac whom Jehovah asked from him back again.

   Thus God deals with Believers and tests them.

   But the next point here is that, in some cases, God Himself tests
   Believers. "It came to pass after those things, that God"--"Elohim,"
   that is the word--"Elohim did tempt Abraham." This does not always
   occur. Job is tried by the devil and the devil tests him, though even
   then God is permitting the devil to be His instrument. But God Himself
   was here, He, Himself, testing His servant, Abraham. I never read that
   He tested Lot. Poor Lot! He was a poor "lot," indeed! There was just
   enough Grace in him to keep him alive and no more--but he could not
   stand any tests. Lot failed wretchedly in Sodom. He was a righteous man
   and proved that he was so by being grieved with the filthy conversation
   of those round about him, but still, God did not test him. There was
   not enough true metal in him for God to try him--He left the Sodomites
   to do that. They were quite good enough to test Lot, but Abraham was a
   man of very different metal, or, at least, there was a much larger
   percentage of gold in Abraham than was to be found in Lot. Therefore
   God tested Abraham.

   O Friends, there is something here to think of! Here is a peculiar
   character whom God, Himself, deals with. Here is a special honor put
   upon the servant when Elohim, Himself, tests Abraham. Have you ever
   prayed, "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
   thoughts: and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
   way everlasting"? Invite Divine inspection and, if God shall come and
   by some extraordinary trial, test you, be not cast down on that
   account, but rather take it as a very choice favor that the King,
   Himself, should put you to the proof to know whether you are, indeed,
   His!

   Further, I want you to notice that, in God's dealings with Believers,
   He tests them again and again. Read the text through, "It came to pass
   after these things, that God did tempt Abraham." After all his life of
   holy obedience, he was still not free from trials! God still tested
   him. He had received great and precious promises, more than any other
   man of his time--and He believed them and sucked the sweetness out of
   them--but after these things God did try Abraham! He had had rare
   enjoyments. Did not angels come and sit at his table? Did not the great
   Melchizedek, himself, come forth with bread and wine to feast him? But
   after these things God tested Abraham. He had been tested before. He
   had left his country. He had sent away Ishmael, whom he loved, when the
   command came, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son." He had been
   tested, but, after all this, he must still be tested!

   These things are an example to all the people of God. We are not yet
   out of the wilderness and we may, even at the very last, have our
   highest test yet to come. "After these things, God did tempt Abraham."
   Abraham had reached a very high point of faith and, after a time, he
   had enjoyed great quiet of spirit. Everything went well with him. By
   faith he had

   fought four kings and led captivity captive. By faith he had trampled
   on the riches of the world and told the king of Sodom that he would
   "not take from a thread even to a shoelace" of him. By faith he had
   become great with God and God had put part of His own name into Abram's
   name, and made Him Abraham, blending the name of God with the name of
   His servant! And yet God tested Abraham--not Abram only--but even
   Abraham!

   Note here, that God did not try Abraham like this at the beginning. It
   is "after these things" God tried Abraham. There was a course of
   education to prepare him for this great testing time and the Lord knows
   how to educate you up to such a point that you can endure, in years to
   come, what you could not endure today--just as today He may make you to
   stand firm under a burden, which, ten years ago, would have crushed you
   into the dust! After all the tuition that God had given to him--after
   close communion with God, receiving the Spirit of God into his soul in
   rich abundance-- "after these things" God tested Abraham.

   And here I go further and say that God tests His people by actual
   experience. He did not test Abraham only by words. He did not say to
   him, "Will you do this? Are you willing to do that?" It is always easy
   to say that we will do a thing if we do not expect to be compelled to
   do it. We can make large promises when we think we shall never be
   called upon to fulfill them. We can even think large things today about
   what we intend to do tomorrow. It is always easy to rise up early
   overnight. But God does not prove His people in only word, but in deed
   and in truth. The plain command came to Abraham which must at once be
   obeyed. He must go into the land of Moriah and he must offer his son
   there for a burnt offering. It must come to real action. How big you
   and I are in words! How great some people are in profession! "Oh," they
   say, "we will never fail our Lord!" Like Peter they swear that, "Though
   all men shall be offended because of You, yet will we never be
   offended." They become bold in their boasts and proud in their own
   conceit, "professing themselves to be wise, they become as fools." They
   may even turn the very Grace of God, which has enriched them, into an
   occasion of vainglory. "I am perfect," says one, "and completely dead
   to the world. Therefore there is no fear that I shall fall. In time of
   trial I shall be strong--if only the martyr times were here, again, how
   gloriously would I testify for God!" But, after all, it is the test of
   real life, the test of actual experience that will show what a man is.
   When God comes to real filing and hammering--and puts us into the
   crucible, then it is that He proves how much is dross and how much is
   true metal!

   Some Believers are tested more thoroughly than others. In this case,
   the Lord tried Abraham most severely. I cannot imagine a greater test
   than that which the Lord applied to Abraham. The Jews usually say that
   Abraham was tried 10 times. Surely on this occasion he was tried 10
   times in one. Here you have trial carried to the 10th degree. Here the
   furnace is made 10 times hotter than it was known to be heated. There
   was no other in the whole universe that ever, by Divine command,
   offered up his only son, save One, and that One was He who commanded
   this sacrifice and who consummated such a sacrifice, Himself, for He
   will never ask of us what He will not Himself do! He gave freely for us
   His only-begotten Son and Abraham stands alone, the only one of woman
   born, that in this was called to be a close imitator of his God. God
   tried him because he could bear it. He tried him in this way because of
   him it was said, he was the friend of God. He was the father of the
   believing family and, because of his high position, he must have the
   very greatest of troubles, trials and tests!

   My last thought, under this head, shall be that if God does thus try
   Believers, He blesses them greatly thereby. All this testing was meant
   to be a great blessing to Abraham. Do I see you start back? Do you seem
   to say that I have used terrible language in speaking thus about God's
   testing His people? Oh, but, Beloved, the tests and trials of God's
   servants, though they rumble a little in our ears, as did the wagons
   that Joseph sent from Egypt to fetch Jacob, bring blessings to us!
   Those wagons came to take Jacob down to a land where he would behold
   the face of his Beloved and should be with him all his life! And our
   trials come to prepare us for the glorious meeting with our Lord. God
   sends us letters in black-edged envelopes, but they are all love
   letters! And the blacker the letters look outside, the brighter they
   are inside! The Lord paints the galleons of His Grace with dark colors
   and we dream that they bear us evil--but they are loaded down to the
   water's brim with gold and rare and precious things! Therefore, be
   confident, tried Believers--

   "Trials make the promise sweet.

   Trials give new life to prayer.

   Trials bring me to His feet,

   Lay me low and keep me there." The first blessed effect of God's test
   of Abraham was that thus he avoided evil. This trial prevented him from
   thinking too much of Isaac and allowing Isaac to divide him from his
   God. Perhaps he was in danger of falling into that sin

   and God saw it--and He sent this test in order to put Isaac into his
   right place, that Isaac might not die. He would have Abraham offer him
   up that he might keep him. He would have him offer Isaac up to God,
   that he might receive him back, for he was not Abraham's son in a
   spiritual sense, until that day. Isaac was his son after the flesh,
   but, when he received him back, again, by faith, he became his son in
   the new Covenant of Grace, one of the seed of Abraham after the Spirit.
   He received his son that day in the highest sense from God.

   Do you not think, also, that it did Abraham great good in assuring his
   own heart and enabling him to know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that
   he really did fear and love God? Some of you get to doubting whether
   you really do fear God. Would it not be worth while to pass through
   some tremendous trouble, to get that settled once and for all? I think
   that the Lord gives some of His people full-assuring tribulations so
   that when once these are past, all doubts and fears are at an end. I
   spoke to a child of God the other day, who said, "I do not know that,
   for 20 years, I have had the slightest hesitation in saying that I know
   whom I have believed. But," he said, "I had an awful fight just before
   that time." It is good to kill the lion and have done with him and then
   go and find honey in his carcass! It is an ordinary lion, however, that
   only needs killing once, for some lions I have met with have been
   killed a good many times, but they seem to come to life again very
   quickly! This test, however, Abraham needed only once and, after that,
   since God Himself said, "Now I know that you fear God," He doubtless
   enabled Abraham to say, "Now I know that I fear God."

   The trial blessed him further in revealing Christ. Do you not think
   that, on this occasion, Abraham had a clearer view of Christ than he
   ever had before? Our Savior says, "Abraham rejoiced to see My day: and
   he saw it, and was glad." When did Abraham see Christ? He may have seen
   Him at other times, but on the top of Moriah, when his own son was on
   the wood and his own hand was lifted up, he must have seen the Son of
   God and the uplifted hand of God offering the Great Sacrifice. When He
   took the ram from the thicket and so saved the life of his son, how
   clearly he must have understood that blessed doctrine of Substitution
   which is the very center of the Gospel! I have no other hope than this.
   Nor can I conceive anything else that would be good news to me but the
   fact, "that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures," that
   there was offered another Life instead of mine through which I live! By
   a life I do not live and by a death I do not die, I am saved! So it was
   with Isaac when he was saved by the ram taken in the thicket. It was
   worth while for Abraham thus to be tested to have a view of Christ!

   And, lastly, Abraham was blessed by the test in communing with the
   Father. To this day, perhaps, Abraham enters more into the heart of God
   than any other man in Heaven. I will not speculate, but it seems to me
   that none of us can ever know such fellowship with the great Father as
   Abraham has known, now, these thousands of years--for when he thinks of
   the great Father who surrendered His Son for the salvation of men, he
   humbly adores the infinite mind. But he seems to say, "And I, too, was
   helped in my little way, as small things may be compared with great, to
   stand and offer up my son as a burnt offering unto the Most High." I
   think that he is still the father of the faithful. I think that Abraham
   still holds wonderful pre-eminence. I do not wonder that we read of
   being in Abraham's bosom--to get as near to Abraham as we can is one of
   the things to be desired--that we may have sympathy and fellowship with
   the eternal Father forever.

   I notice that some of the old translators render the passage, "It came
   to pass, after these things that God did lift up Abraham." It is a
   strange translation and probably inaccurate, but it is wonderfully
   true, for all that--for God did lift up Abraham to a higher platform,
   altogether, and brought him into a greater nearness to Himself than he
   could have known in any other way.

   So far, I have occupied your mind on a grand subject, the Lord's way
   with Believers.

   II. My second subject is a very practical one. THE BELIEVER'S WAY WITH
   THE LORD--for if God has dealings with the Believer, the Believer also
   has communion with the Lord.

   It takes two to make communion and fellowship. Is it not a wonderful
   thing that men can thus meet God and commune with Him face to face?
   This is the glory of faith, for, "he that comes to God must believe
   that He is." This is not an arbitrary condition, but arises from the
   nature of things. Just as in a map of the two hemispheres, the circles
   only touch and only can touch at one point, so God can only meet men by
   faith. Thus, to be a Believer in God is to have a faculty by which we
   can touch the Eternal.

   It is not enough, however, merely to know God as the Creator. "You
   believe in God, believe also in Me," says the Lord Jesus. "No man comes
   unto the Father, but by Me." Better be a Believer in Christ than have
   all the wealth of the Indies rolled to your feet and all the thrones of
   the world at your disposal, for you then possess the unsearchable
   riches of

   Christ and will, one day, share His Throne of Glory! Oh, that all who
   now hear my words were, indeed, among those who believe! Why should you
   not venture at this moment to launch out on the ocean of Divine Truth?
   It is no venture, for a Believer in Christ is one who cannot be lost!
   God deals with those who believe as He dealt with Abraham and only
   those who believe can have dealings with Him. How, then, does the
   Believer act towards God? Let us look at the case before us.

   God said to the Patriarch, "Abraham," and he said, "Behold, here I am."
   When God speaks to the Believer, he, on his part, is honored by the
   call. Have you ever heard God speak to you? I do not mean that with
   your ears you have heard any audible voice, but has He not spoken to
   your heart in such a way that, if there were no other men alive, God
   could not have spoken more pointedly and definitely to you? God called
   Abraham. It is the way with Him to say, "Samuel, Samuel." It is the way
   with Him to call, "Saul, Saul." "I have called you by your name; you
   are Mine." "He calls His own sheep by name and leads them out." What
   greater honor can we have than this? The King knows our name and
   addresses us! In a law court, one day, a man who was quite at the back
   began to struggle and press his way forward. And the people angrily
   told him to be quiet. "Did you not hear?" he said, "I am called."
   Instantly they opened a way for him to the front and admired his prompt
   action. How much readier we should be to reply to the voice of God,
   recognizing the privilege and honor thus bestowed upon us! Have you not
   had such a call and responded to it?

   Next, the Believer shows himself ready to be taught. As soon as God
   said, "Abraham," he answered, "Here I am." He seemed to say, "Here I
   am, Lord, all attentive. Master, say on! Speak, Lord, for Your servant
   hears." Are you always in that condition, ready to be taught of God? Is
   His Word precious to you? Is His Holy Spirit greatly reverenced by you,
   so that the moment you hear Him call, you wait to hear what God the
   Lord will speak to you, knowing that "He will speak peace unto His
   people and to His saints"? Happy is the man who is thus ready to be
   taught!

   Moreover, the Believer must be ready to obey as well as ready to be
   taught. He must be willing to say, "Here I stand as Your servant. I
   know not what the orders are going to be, but here I am. Send me where
   You will with what burden You will, as long as You will. Here I am." If
   you are not willing to obey, you may be quite sure you are not a
   Believer, for obedience is the natural outcome of belief. You remember
   the last verse of the third of John--"he that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life. "And then, immediately, another word is used which
   bears a stronger sense and may be rendered, "He that obeys not the Son
   shall not see life." For, truly, if we believe on Christ, we shall also
   obey Him. Are you, dear Friend, willing to say to God, "Here I am. Send
   me--let me be actively engaged in Your service. Or, if it pleases You
   better, bid me go up to my bed, lie there and suffer sickness and pain.
   I am ready to obey, just as You will"? Abraham was ready to be taught
   and ready to obey.

   And, more than that, the Believer will be equally ready to surrender.
   "Abraham." "Here I am." He does not know what God is going to ask of
   him. It may be Sarah. It may be Isaac. I dare say that Isaac was the
   last person that he expected would be asked of him, seeing that all his
   hopes were bound up in him and he was the child of promise. God often
   does the unexpected with His servants. However, there was no reserve
   about it. Abraham said, "Here I am"--

   "Yes, should You take them all away, Yet will I not repine. Before they
   were possessed by me They were entirely Thine."

   And they are still entirely Yours! Oh, what a glorious state of
   mind--to be ready to learn, ready to obey and ready to surrender!

   And Abraham was also ready to be inspected. He says, "Here I am." Adam
   went and hid himself in the garden and God had to call after him,
   "Where are you?" Abraham was ready when God called him. It will be well
   if you can say, when you kneel at your bedside tonight, "Lord, I have
   nothing to conceal. I am sincere before You. I would have You
   acquainted with all my faults and sins, that You may wash them away. I
   would have You know all my mistakes and errors, that You may correct
   them all. You know all things. You know that I love You. I am no
   hypocrite. I have made no pretence of being Your servant while I have
   been serving self and sin." O blessed man, that dares to open his
   bosom, to lay bare his very heart and say, "Shine into me, O Lord, and
   let Your searching light go through and through me, for in truth I am
   Your servant!"

   The Believer who is prepared to respond to the Lord in such a way has
   much cause to praise, for he has been made ready by the Grace of God.
   Abraham could not have said, "Here I am," with all this promptness, if
   it had not been for the

   education of Divine Grace that had brought him up to it. Beloved, you
   may think yourself ready for any service or any trial, but you are not
   unless Divine Grace has done great things for you. Then every act
   performed by Grace becomes, through Grace, an apprenticeship for a
   greater one!

   For God's sake, Abraham had left his country and his father's house.
   Have you come out from the world? If you have not, you cannot say,
   "Here I am." Poor Soul, still siding with the world, you are where you
   ought not to be! "Come out from among them, and be you separate, says
   the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and
   will be a Father unto you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says
   the Lord Almighty." Abraham had boldly obeyed God's command and
   separated himself from his old companions.

   Next, Abraham had yielded to Lot. He let him take his choice of the
   best part of the land, even the well-watered plain of Sodom. He had not
   disputed with him. Are you willing to let the worldling have the best
   of it here, below, and to take your portion, by-and-by, in the Promised
   Land? If not, you cannot say, "Here I am," because you will probably be
   up to your neck in worldliness and as greedy after gain as anybody
   else! You are taking your portion among the men of Sodom and
   Gomorrah--how can you say, "Here I am"? Lot could not have said it, but
   Abraham could.

   Moreover, Abraham had defied foes. Four kings came into the country and
   he had only a handful of servants and friends, yet he went after them
   like a flash of lightning and smote the four kings. Well, now, if you
   are a cowardly fellow and have never dared to, "Stand up, stand up for
   Jesus," you cannot say, "Here I am." Where are you? Hiding away, trying
   to save your precious skin and to avoid being laughed at for Christ?
   You will not be ready for the Lord's call till you come out and "fight
   the good fight of faith."

   But God had trained His servant Abraham to do yet more. He had despised
   the world when he told the king of Sodom that he would not take
   anything of his, "from a thread even to a shoelace." And now he can
   say, "Here I am." Until we get free from all worldly entanglements and
   cease, even in the least thing, to rely on an arm of flesh, or to
   resort to worldly expedients, we shall not be prepared to respond
   instantly to the call of God!

   Abraham had gone even further. He had cast out the bondwoman and her
   son and now he could say, "Here I am." As long as you hold on to
   legalism and trust in your own good works, you dare not rise to meet
   God, for you are under the Law and not under Grace! But when that is
   all gone, you can say, "Here I am, in the Covenant of Grace, standing
   in Christ Jesus, ready for anything."

   Again, Abraham had prevailed with God in prayer. You remember how he
   had pleaded for the wicked cities of the plain and God had allowed him
   to continue his intercessions with great boldness? O Beloved, you
   cannot say, "Here I am," if God has never known you as a suppliant at
   His Throne of Grace! Sometimes I have said to myself, "The Lord Jesus
   Christ can never say to me at the last, 'I never knew you: depart from
   Me,' for He has known me as I know a poor man in the street who has
   begged of me every day." 1 am always begging of my Lord, clamoring at
   Him for one thing or another. He knows me well enough. Why, when I was
   but a youth, I trusted Him for my eternal salvation! He called me to
   Himself and blessed me. I know that He will never be able to say to me,
   "I never knew you." Beloved, this is why Abraham was so quick in
   responding to God's call, because he was God's friend who was on such
   intimate terms with his Lord that he could intercede with Him on the
   behalf of guilty men!

   My last thought is most precious. Since the Believer is thus prepared
   by Grace to respond to the Lord's call, as Abraham did, when he said,
   "Here I am," he will be kept ready to the end. My great desire is that
   you and I should be ready for anything that the Lord wills and keep
   always ready for it, so that if Christ should come at cock-crowing, or
   should come at midday, or midnight, we would be ready! And if death
   should come, we would be ready. And if we should lose our dearest
   friend, our choicest treasure, our health--anything or everything--yet
   still we would, each one, say, "Lord, I never made any bargain with
   You. I never had anything reserved from You. If it is Your will, it is
   my will. If You say it, so be it, for who am I, and what is Your
   servant, that I should dare to dispute with the Infinite Wisdom of

   Infallible Love?"

   Happy is the man who can say, "Here I am." The Lord put you into that
   frame of mind and then it shall be said of you, "He shall not be afraid
   of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." You shall
   go merrily through life and joyfully to death--and you shall rise
   triumphantly in the glad morning--for when God shall call you, then you
   will each one answer, "Here I am, for You did call me."--

   "From beds of dust and silent clay,"

   we shall arise with songs in our mouths to answer to the Resurrection
   trumpet and so shall we be forever with the Lord. Thus shall all the
   children of faith be blessed with faithful Abraham! God bless these
   words to you, dear Friends, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Genesis 22.
     __________________________________________________________________

"If You Can"--"If You Can"

   (No. 2224)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 4, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN, NEWINGTON.

   "If You can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. Jesus said
   unto him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him that
   believes." Mark 9:22,23.

   WE are all familiar with the story of this youth who was possessed by a
   dumb spirit which caused him to fall into violent fits of epilepsy and
   worked worse evils, casting him, at times, into the waters and into the
   fire to destroy him. The father intended to bring his child to Jesus,
   of whom he had heard so much, but our Lord, being absent, he made his
   application to the disciples. They failed to effect a cure but,
   by-and-by, the Master came from the mountaintop and then the father
   addressed himself to the Lord. I shall need you to notice some lessons
   from this story before I come to the text.

   The main thought which I would emphasize is that our Lord would have us
   clearly know, when we seek a blessing, what it is we really seek. If
   you go to Jesus Christ for anything, either for yourself, or someone
   else, the Savior will earnestly desire that you should know what it is
   that you are asking of Him. You know there is much blind
   praying--asking for mercies because you know that such and such words
   are proper, without having a clear and vivid idea of what the blessing
   is which is intended by those words. Now, our Savior loves us to pray
   with the understanding and to have a consciousness of our need and some
   perception of what it is that we want Him to do. Therefore try to got
   into your own heart a clear notion of what it is that you are seeking,
   for Christ would have you know why you are pleading with Him.

   Hence, when this man came with his sick child, the Savior permitted him
   to give a statement of the case and, with the eagerness of love, the
   father entered into full particulars of the evil which had befallen his
   son. This was not needed by the Savior for His own information--He knew
   all about the dumb spirit's possession of the poor lad and all the
   misery that had resulted from that possession--but the heart-rending
   account was given, first, in order that the father might distinctly
   remember the evil from which he desired his child to be saved and,
   then, that those who were standing round might know what kind of
   miracle it was which Jesus Christ was about to work. Sometimes it will
   be a very healthy thing for seekers to stop a while and say to
   themselves, "What is it we are seeking?" Christ may say to you, "What
   do you want that I should do for you? What is it are you really asking
   for?" There are many that cry, "Lord, save me!" who, perhaps, have no
   distinct idea from what they are to be saved, or to what they are to be
   saved.

   In connection with this statement of the case, our Lord had permitted
   this poor man to make an application to His disciples. I will not say
   that it was on purpose that he might meet with a failure, but I do
   believe that failure was meant to teach the man a valuable lesson--and
   certainly it was designed to instruct the disciples--showing clearly to
   both that all hope lies in Jesus Christ, Himself. You have been
   seeking, dear Friend. Now, how have you hoped to get saved? "Why, by
   attending the means of Grace," you say. Quite right and I have not a
   word to say against the means of Grace any more than I should have had
   a word to say against the Apostles! But the means of Grace cannot save
   you any more than the Apostles could cast the devil out of that child!
   It is not the means of Grace, but it is Christ, Himself, that you must
   go to, just as it was not the Apostles, but the Apostles' Master who
   had to work this miracle!

   Perhaps you have been sitting in these pews for years, expecting
   something to come to you by your constant and continued attendance. The
   Lord wants to get you thoroughly convinced that you will not be saved
   except by going to Jesus Christ, Himself. No Bible-readings, no
   sermon-hearings, no, not even prayers, if they are relied upon, can
   save you! Your reliance must be upon the wonder-working Christ of God!
   If you will trust the Savior, you shall be saved at once. If you can
   believe, now, you shall have immediate forgiveness of every sin and
   instantaneous salvation by the power of the Christ of God! But, it may
   be, you have not thought of this. You have been going round about and
   now you are to be sickened

   of all that, so that you shall say, like the man in the narrative, "I
   spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast him out, and they could
   not. I have used the means of Grace, I have heard Your ministers, I
   have read good books, but neither books, nor ministers, nor services,
   nor all combined, can cast the devil out of me. Lord, You must do it."
   The failure of every other hope is another thing that Christ would have
   us know when we come to Him for a great blessing.

   Yet further, when the poor father had stated the case and had confessed
   that he was disappointed with the disciples, yet the Savior caused him
   to see another exhibition of the mischief from which he would have his
   child saved. Then and there, before them all, as they brought the boy
   to Jesus, the devil began to treat him, perhaps, more violently then
   ever! He foamed at the mouth and seemed, at last, to fall into such a
   condition that those who looked on said, "He is dead. The case is
   utterly hopeless." In the very Presence of Christ, the evil spirit made
   a supreme effort to retain his hold of his victim, or to destroy the
   body in which he dwelt before he left it!

   Now, Beloved, the Lord may, in your case, if you are a seeker, permit
   sin to break loose in you in a possibly worse form than you have ever
   seen before He drives it out. It may be you will give yourself up for
   dead. In fact, I hope you may, for when death strikes every carnal hope
   and you utterly despair of salvation in yourself, then is the very
   moment when the Omnipotent Power of Divine Grace comes in and manifests
   itself without limit! Oh, you who are driven, tonight, to utter
   self-despair, I am glad of it! I expect to see Christ come to you and
   raise you up and say to the evil spirit, "Depart, and enter into him no
   more." God grant it may be so!

   Or, if your anxiety is about somebody else, it may be that God will
   permit the sin in the dear one to break out worse than ever. You have
   been praying for months, perhaps for years and, at last, it will seem
   quite hopeless. You will bring your husband or your child to Christ and
   instead of seeing any change for the better, there may appear, at the
   time, to be even a change for the worse! Yet, remember, it was then
   that Jesus said, "If you can believe, all things are possible to him
   that believes." It may be that He will let us see, more vividly than we
   have ever perceived before, the desperateness of the case in order that
   we may the more clearly understand the greatness of the mercy which we
   are seeking at His hands.

   I shall run the text, as it were, with two handles. You see, properly,
   it should be confined to the case of a person who is praying for
   others, for this was spoken to a father who was pleading for his son.
   But the same principle applies all round and so I beg those who are
   praying for themselves to take as much of the sermon home as they
   can--and may God the Holy Spirit make it suitable to them! Come we,
   then, with this introduction, to our text.

   There are two "ifs" here. The poor, troubled man said to Christ, "if,"
   implying some measure of doubt--"If you can do anything, have
   compassion on us, and help us." Then comes the other "if," Jesus said
   unto him, "If you can believe, all things are possible to him that
   believes."

   I. Let us begin by saying, in the first place, that THE "IF" IS NOT IN
   REGARD TO CHRIST as to whether He can save you, or as to whether, in
   answer to prayer, He can save the object of your anxiety. There really
   is no, "if," in reference to Christ, though it is quite probable that
   your unbelief is suggesting some doubt about His love, or power, or
   willingness to save.

   There cannot be an, "if," about Christ being able to save a sinner, or
   to do anything because, first, He is God's beloved Son. Upon the snowy
   slopes of Hermon, adown whose steeps He had come to confront the
   multitude in the plain, Christ had been transfigured and in all His
   Glory He had shone like the sun in the presence of His three disciples,
   whiter than the snow which lay around them and out of the cloud which
   overshadowed them there had come forth a Divine Voice, "This is My
   beloved Son: hear Him." Now, if Jesus Christ is such a favorite of
   Heaven, the darling of the eternal Father, will He deny Him anything? I
   do not say that, "if," as being at all doubtful about the matter. The
   revelation of the Glory on the mount and the Voice out of the opened
   heavens are evidence enough of His Sonship. Even Satan, himself, could
   not deny that Jesus was the Son of God. In the wilderness of
   temptation, he, indeed, said, "If you are the Son of God, command that
   these stones be made bread," but he knew in his heart that Christ was
   truly the Son of the Most High God. On many occasions, the demons, whom
   Christ cast out, cried aloud to Him, "You are Christ, the Son of God."
   Being God's true Son, can anything be impossible for Him? Did He not
   say, "All power is given unto Me in Heaven and in earth"? When I think
   of the love which God bears to His dear Son, I cannot imagine Him
   stinting Christ in power to bless. He is able to save unto the
   uttermost all that come unto God by Him, for He is the Everlasting Son
   of the Eternal Father!

   And remember, next, if that argument is not enough, that Jesus Christ
   is God. After that, can there be an, "if," as to His power? What is
   there that God cannot do? He has made this world! He has made those
   millions of worlds that stud the midnight skies, but all that God has
   ever made, though it is far beyond our conceptions, is but as a speck
   compared with what He could make if He pleased. He has done exceedingly
   great marvels, such as have astounded men, but all that God has ever
   done is as nothing compared with what He could do if He willed to do
   it, for with Him all things are possible! And Jesus Christ being very
   God of very God, all things are possible with Him. He can save everyone
   present in this house right now. Breathe a believing prayer to Him and
   you will prove His power, for He will save you! His word runs very
   quickly and if He does but send it forth, it will belt the world and,
   within the next few years, if He chooses so to work, all nations shall
   call Jesus blessed! But when you and I have one of God's promises to
   plead with Him, we may know most surely that He will keep it--we never
   need insert an, "if," as to whether He can or not! O Beloved, if we
   were more wicked than we are, He could change us! And if our children
   or our friends were sunk in sin more deeply than they are, which God
   forbid they should be, He could still save them! "The Lord's hand is
   not shortened, that it cannot save; neither His ear heavy, that it
   cannot hear." Fie on you, you doubting one! Shame on you, you trembling
   heart! There cannot be an, "if," with the Christ of God, God's favored
   Son--yes, God's equal--who is girded with Omnipotence!

   And, in the third place, remember that, as Savior, works of Grace are
   easy to Him. If you will but think, for a minute, of what He has done
   in order to man's salvation, I think you will see there cannot be an,
   "if," with Him. See Him hanging on the accursed tree, nailed up to the
   gallows that He may die. His pains of body are inconceivably great, but
   meanwhile He is forsaken of His God and is brought into unknown
   tortures of soul. That is the Son of God who is dying so! It is He,
   whose face is the glory of Heaven, who is thus dying the death of a
   felon, "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." I have
   such a conviction of the power of Christ's death that if it were
   revealed to me that on the Cross He redeemed not only one world, but as
   many fallen worlds as there are stars, I could well believe it!

   Oh, the blood of the Son of God! What merit there must be in such a
   Sacrifice as that! Infinite Deity united to perfect manhood and the
   whole life laid down that men might live! Tell me that Christ cannot
   save! Tell me that His blood will not wash out the most scarlet sin
   that ever defiled man! I know better. There must be infinite virtue in
   the atoning Sacrifice of Christ. There cannot be an, "if," about the
   power of the Crucified to forgive all who come to Him and trust in His
   great Sacrifice!

   If you question the power of His death, remember that He rose again
   from the dead and upward He went into Glory and there, today, He sits
   enthroned. I think I can see Him, now, at the right hand of the Father,
   clothed with everlasting honor and Divine majesty! What is He doing?
   Look! He lifts His hands. He pleads for sinners! Will the Father deny
   Him anything? He makes intercession for the transgressors! Will God
   refuse to bless them? Oh, by the living Christ at God's right hand,
   pleading the merit of His own Sacrifice, I would have you confident
   that there cannot be an, "if," about His power to save any of the
   children of men!

   Do not tell me that you are the worst sinner that ever lived. I will
   take it for granted that you are and I will go further than that and
   suppose you are a lot worse than you think you are! I have sometimes
   had people coming to me as enquirers and sitting in a chair opposite
   me. They have begun by telling me about their dreadful sins. I have
   generally said to them, "You need not tell me that. I have not the
   slightest doubt that you are a thousand times worse than you tell me,
   or than you think you are. You are only fit to be cast into Hell." And
   then they say, "Ah, it is so; it is so." Right glad am I to hear them
   consent to the verdict, for that is the sort of people that Jesus
   Christ came to save! Do you think that He came to redeem some little
   miserable morsel of a sinner who never did anything very much that was
   wrong? Well, very likely He did, but He came to be a great Savior for
   great sinners. Suppose that, some day, you come and with glowing
   enthusiasm tell me there is a great doctor in London. I would probably
   say, "What does he do?" "He has a large number of patients," you
   answer. "But what does he do?" At length you give the astonishing
   reply, "He cures bad fingers." Well, I do not see much in that.

   But suppose, on the contrary, that in answer to my question, "What does
   this great physician do that you are crying up so much?" you are able
   to give a true report and say, "He has restored a great many persons
   who were given up by everybody else. He can cure the very worst
   diseases. In fact, they say that if a man were almost dead, he could
   make him alive." Why, then, indeed I would begin to sing his praises,
   too! And if I were diseased, I would go to him for cure. But I am more
   confident about the power of Christ to heal, for to Him I went when my
   sin was past all human remedy--and

   He made me every whit whole! There is no language strong enough to tell
   of His power to save and bless. If you believe that my Master can only
   save a small sinner, who has only a little imperceptible sin about him,
   I tell you that you do not know Him! He is a great Savior for great
   sinners and, however grossly guilty you may have been, lament it, mourn
   over it, but remember that Christ is able to save even the very chief
   of sinners. He is able to save them now, right now, where they are
   standing or sitting--and to send them out of this house new creatures
   in Him! Thus you see that the "if" is not in Christ.

   II. But now, secondly, where is the "if"? THE "IF" IS IN OUR LACK OF
   FAITH. Jesus said to the man, "If you can believe, all things are
   possible to him that believes." But why is faith needed?

   The answer is, first, that it is a reasonable demand and that it is
   most unreasonable to expect Christ to do anything for us if we will not
   believe in Him. The very least thing that a great surgeon could expect
   of a patient would be confidence in his skill. Do not marvel,
   therefore, that Jesus Christ expects you to believe in Him and, "if you
   will not believe, surely you shall not be established." If you refuse
   Christ your confidence, you cannot wonder if He refuses you His
   salvation! "If you can." It seems almost as if the Lord, in
   astonishment, echoed this poor father's words, starting back in wonder
   that He should be so misunderstood--that any human being should come to
   Him, who created all things--and yet doubt His power! The poor leper,
   who came to Him after the sermon on the mount, had a different way of
   expressing his misgiving. He said, "If you will," doubting not Christ's
   power to heal, but His willingness. I know not which is the worse, but
   I am sure that both are unreasonable, for if either the willingness or
   ability is absent, Christ cannot be a Savior for sinful men. But, as we
   often sing--

   "He is able,

   He is willing; doubt no more."

   Faith is needed, in the next place, because it is for God's Glory. It
   would not be for Christ's Glory to bless those that do not believe in
   Him. Shall He reward unbelief? Will you have it said that Christ came
   to this earth and that He lived and died for the salvation of sinners
   and that, after that, though a man would not believe in Him, He still
   gave him pardon and mercy? No, there shall never be such a thing as a
   pardoned unbeliever! A saved man who does not believe in Christ? That
   would be to the dishonor of Christ and would make Him to be rather the
   patron of sin than the Savior from sin! Faith is required, then, that
   God may have the glory of man's salvation.

   This faith is also for our own good. Our Lord means to bless that poor
   man by healing his child, but He means to bless him doubly by healing
   him of his unbelief, for it is, indeed, a horrible weakness, for a man
   to lack faith in His Creator! It is a loathsome disease of spirit for a
   man to be doubtful of his God! I have looked down the list of crimes
   and though there are some that are truly abominable, yet when I have
   looked into the very foulest transgression, I have not seen anything so
   vile as the sin of a man who doubts the love and power of Christ, who
   died that men might live! This is the masterpiece of Hell's temptation.
   We are led farthest away from God when we doubt the love which He has
   sealed with the blood of His own heart. It is, therefore, for our own
   good that we should believe. Here and always, God's Glory and our good
   are closely joined. To glorify God will be to enjoy Him forever.

   Faith, then, is a reasonable, glorious and blessed thing and, in the
   sinner's case, it is absolutely necessary to salvation. We must believe
   in Jesus Christ if we would be saved. But cannot we be saved without
   believing? No. What will become of us if we do not believe in Jesus
   Christ? Well, I will make no "ifs" nor "ans" about that--"He that
   believes not shall be damned." I do not care to beat about the bush, or
   seek for a more refined version of the text--let it stand there in its
   own terrible simplicity, "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved; but he that believes not shall be damned." If you do not believe
   in Jesus Christ, you will be damned, whatever that means--and it means
   something truly terrible, to be condemned of God and driven from His
   Presence because we do not believe in Him! There is no help for it, for
   there is no other salvation and no other door of hope except through
   faith in the appointed Savior of mankind! As John Newton, that great
   sinner saved by marvelous Grace, says--

   "The worst of all diseases Is light, compared with sin! On every part
   it seizes, But rages most within. 'Tis palsy, poison, fever, And
   madness, all combined--

   And none but a Believer The least relief can find."

   Here is where the, "if," is, then--it is in our lack of faith.

   III. But now, in the third place, let me ask, WHAT PUTS THE "IF" THERE?
   Why is it that we cannot believe? If some unprejudiced person who
   before had been totally unacquainted with the Bible, read it for the
   first time, and was asked, "Is it a hard thing that God asks of men in
   order to their salvation, that they should believe in Jesus Christ,
   whom He has sent?" any unsophisticated mind would reply, "No, that must
   be the easiest thing in the world, for God cannot lie!" Such a verdict
   would be absolutely true, for the gift of His Son, whom He loved as He
   loved Himself, proves the honesty of God and leaves no room for doubt
   as to the certainty and the heartiness of His willingness to bless the
   sons of men. God could not be false and go so far with the falsehood as
   to give His own Son to die--that is altogether inconceivable! It seems
   of necessity, then, that God is true in declaring that He will save
   those who trust in His Son. And it looks, at first sight, as if it
   would be the simplest thing in all the world to trust in Jesus
   Christ--and so, indeed, it is. But why is it that there are any "ifs"
   about it? Why is it necessary that Christ should say, "If you can
   believe"?

   The reason is because we are alienated in heart from God. If we were
   right with God, faith would be a matter of necessity. But we do not
   love God. By nature we even hate Him and that is why we do not trust
   Him. It would be a very wretched thing to meet with a young man who, if
   you were speaking to him in praise of his father, should say, "I do not
   believe in my father." If you continued, "But your father is a man of
   the highest integrity," would it not be sad to hear him reply, "I
   cannot trust him"? "Oh, but your father is kindness, itself," you might
   add. And if the lad said, "Yes, I hear what you say, but I do not
   believe it--I cannot trust him," you would know that there was some
   dreadful family feud, some most unhappy circumstance that had twisted
   that youth's mind so that he did not love his father and, therefore,
   did not believe in him! Supposing his father to be a man of undoubted
   repute and integrity, the last thing that you would expect to happen
   would be that his own son would say, "I cannot believe him."

   Now, concerning God, who among us will so blaspheme Him as to say that
   He was ever false? Yet men say it and do not seem at all startled at
   what they have said! Though it is written, "He that believes not God
   has made Him a liar," men will still calmly tell us, as if it were an
   amiable weakness rather than a sin, "Sir, I cannot believe in Christ. I
   cannot believe in God." It is, then, because you are alienated from Him
   because you do not love Him! Lament this! Confess it before God and
   when your heart is renewed, by His Grace, then faith will come as a
   matter of course.

   Another reason for this, "if," is that we are idolaters by nature. "No,
   no," you say, "we are not idolaters!" I say we are idolaters by
   nature--all of us--for what is an idolater but one who needs to have an
   idol, or a something which he can see, trust in and which shall
   represent to him the invisible? The Romanist becomes an idolater as he
   puts before him the "crucifix," or some precious relic of the saints.
   But you may become an idolater, too, without seeming to be so
   superstitious. You are such, indeed, if, in Providence, for instance,
   you cannot trust God. If before you trust Him you need to have your
   income regularly guaranteed, it is not God, you then trust--it is the
   money. So with your soul. You could trust God, you say, if an angel
   were to come from Heaven to speak, or if you heard a voice in the
   night. So, then, it is not God that you would trust, but an angel, or a
   voice! You need something to see and something to hear. It is ingrained
   in human nature thus to seek a sign--and what is that but idolatry? Oh,
   that we would get rid of this and say, "God is invisible. I am not to
   expect to see Him--I am to trust Him. I am to believe that He who made
   the heavens and the earth, and who gave His Son to die, will save me,
   and lo, I put my trust in His dear Son once and for all!"

   Another reason why this, "if," comes in, is because we measure God by
   ourselves. We cannot think that God can forgive us because we find it
   so hard to forgive our fellow creatures. We cannot conceive that God
   will do it freely, from no motive but that of pure Grace, because we
   are so mercenary. We need to be paid for what we do and unless we can
   see some chance of reward, somewhere or other, we are very slow to make
   anything like a sacrifice! And so we think that God is altogether such
   as we are, whereas you remember it is written, "For as the heavens are
   higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My
   thoughts than your thoughts." We get to measuring God by our fellow
   men. We say, "Such-and-such a one is very good, but he would never
   forgive after this fashion. He would give generously, but he certainly
   would not give after the style that God is spoken of as giving." Thus,
   as the Ethiopians are said to make their angels with black faces, we
   imagine God to be like ourselves or other men and, therefore, find it
   difficult to believe in

   Him.

   Dismiss from your thoughts all such ideas of God! You might sooner hold
   the ocean in the hollow of your hand, or span the heavens with your
   fingers than, unaided by Grace, get an idea of the greatness and glory
   of God by all your searching! Never forget that He is as great in mercy
   as in any other of His attributes. He delights to forgive! It is the
   joy of His heart to press to His bosom His prodigal children! Nothing
   gives such intense satisfaction to the heart of God as the
   manifestation of His boundless Grace. I wish you could believe this.
   But it is because we thus limit the Holy One of Israel that we find the
   simple matter of faith so difficult. Because of this, there stands that
   great, ugly black, stiff, "if." "If you can believe."

   IV. In conclusion, let me ask another question and seek to answer it.
   HOW CAN THIS "IF" BE REMOVED? Are there any in this house who are
   longing to be saved and who have been putting an, "if," upon Christ,
   and saying, "Lord, if You can"? First, let them know that the "if" lies
   with themselves. And then let us join hands and see if we cannot turn
   this "if out. Come, Brother, let me help you. If this "if has been too
   strong for you, I would ask God's Spirit to bless a few words to you,
   that this "if may be got rid of. With reference to that other "if which
   came from the lips of the leper and to which I have already referred, I
   heard of a little girl whose mother found her, one day, with a carving
   knife and the family Bible. "What are you doing?" she asked her child,
   in some anxiety for the safety of both the child and the Book. "O
   Mother," she said, "I was reading about that man who came to Jesus and
   said, 'If You will, You can make me clean,' and I thought He ought not
   to have said, "if," to Jesus--so please, Mother, I am scraping it out."
   A very good thing to do with all our "ifs"! How shall we go to work
   with this one? Well, we had better imitate this man with his epileptic
   child possessed of a devil.

   First of all, you must confess the faith you have. This man said,
   "Lord, I believe." There is something in that. If you cannot go as far
   as you would, go as far as you can. What do you believe about Jesus
   Christ? Come, poor, dear, trembling Heart, run over in your mind what
   you believe about Him. I think I could have said, before I really
   trusted Christ, "Lord Jesus, I believe You are the Son of God." I
   believed that, I never doubted it. "And I believe that You are sent to
   be the Savior of men." I do not know that I ever doubted that. Some of
   you from your childhood have believed that, too. Your mother taught you
   that and when you read the Scriptures, you were sure of it. Well, now,
   just turn that over. "Lord, I believe You are the Son of God. I believe
   You are God. I believe You are able to save. I believe Your precious
   blood takes away the sin of all who trust You. I believe that whoever
   trusts in You has everlasting life. I believe that You have sent Your
   Gospel into the world, saying, 'He that believes and is baptized shall
   be saved.' Lord, by Your Grace, I believe all

   this."

   That is a matter to be very thankful for and yet, do you know that is a
   matter that will condemn you unless you go farther? If you believe as
   much as that, you ought to believe more! I can understand the atheist
   or deist not trusting Christ. I can understand the Socinian not
   trusting Christ--but if you are sound in your doctrinal beliefs, I
   cannot think of an excuse for you why you should not trust Christ! If a
   man says to me, "I believe you, Sir, to be a thief. I cannot trust
   you," that is perfectly consistent, is it not? But if he says, "Sir, I
   believe you are an upright man who would not, on any account, do a
   doubtful thing and yet I cannot trust you." I am not anxious to answer
   such a man as that, for out of his own mouth he condemns himself.

   So, some of you go so far that if you do not go farther, you will
   condemn yourselves. Surely, in all reason, if a man can say to Christ,
   "I believe that You are the Christ that should come into the world. I
   believe that You are the Son of God; I believe that You were raised
   again from the dead. I believe that you sit at the right had of God,
   pleading for sinners," that man must also add, "Therefore I trust You."
   It is the natural inference to be drawn! God help you, then, to confess
   such faith as you have!

   The next way to knock this, "if," over, is to appeal to Christ to be
   helped against it. "Lord, I believe," said this poor man, "help You my
   unbelief." He cried out of the depths of his soul, "O Lord, help me
   against my unbelief!" So poor Heart, you have been trying to believe!
   Did you ever try this man's plan of believing that Christ could make
   him believe? That is odd, is it not? You see, he must have had faith in
   Christ, or else he would not have said, "Help You my unbelief." Let us
   imitate him and cry with Cowper--

   "Heal us, Emmanuel, here we are,

   Waiting to feel your touch! Deep-wounded souls to You repair, And,
   Savior, we are such!

   Our faith is feeble, we confess, We faintly trust Your Word, But will
   You pity us the less? Be that far from You, O Lord! Remember him who
   once applied With trembling for relief, 'Lord I believe,' with tears he
   cried, Oh, help my unbelief!"

   Oftentimes there is a great deal more faith in a poor sinner's heart
   than he thinks there is. He really is trusting the Savior, but does not
   know he is doing so. He is saved and yet is afraid to think it can be
   possible. Long after I knew the Savior and believed in Him, I used, at
   times, to be staggered with the thought that it was too good to be
   true. The tempter would say, "It cannot be that you are really
   forgiven, that you are Christ's own, that you are washed in His blood
   and saved forever!" Well, it does almost seem to be too good to be true
   but, then, nothing is too good to be true when you are dealing with a
   king! If it is a king who is about to act, we say that the grander and
   kinglier a thing it is, the more likely it is to be done. But rise
   higher than kings! If it is superlative, if it is infinite, if it is
   altogether inconceivable but for its having been revealed, then is it
   the more likely to be true, for it is the more like God! Oh, then, I
   pray you, bring your unbelief before Christ and let it die in His
   Presence! Unbelief does not like the Cross. If you look up to the dying
   Savior, to the risen Christ of God, unbelief dies! God help you, then,
   to say, "Lord, I believe; help You my unbelief"!

   One other thing you must do if you are to follow the example of this
   father. Bring the case to Christ. This poor man brought his child to
   Christ. It was a hard tug and he asked others to help him. Do you not
   see how the suffering child was tossed about--sometimes this way,
   sometimes that? You may have seen some poor man or woman who is subject
   to fits and noticed in what a way such people are convulsed. But this
   poor child was much worse--he was foaming at the mouth, raving, tearing
   and full of the fiend! The father is trying to help his boy. Sometimes
   he holds him by the waist. But the child tears away. Then another helps
   grasp one hand, while the father gets hold of the other. He drags him
   to Christ--pulls him almost piecemeal to Christ--but he gets him there
   at last. "Bring him to Me," said Christ, and what better could the
   father do, or can you do, than obey the command and bring your loved
   one? So he did and he laid him down at Jesus' feet. Where else is so
   fitting a place for the sick or devil-possessed as the feet of the
   Savior? "To whom shall we go" if we turn away from His tender heart?
   When the boy in the harvest field cried out in pain, his father said,
   "Carry him to his mother." Where else could he be so soothed and
   helped--and where else but in Christ can you or your children hope for
   blessing?

   That is what I want you to do with your friends-- somehow get them to
   Jesus Christ by mighty, vehement, determined prayer! And when you have
   prayed about them, try to get them to hear the Gospel. I like to preach
   to people who have never heard the Gospel before--it is grand work!
   There are some of you upon whom I fear that I shall never make an
   impression. You have been hammered upon so long that I am afraid you
   have become Gospel-hardened. Take a person out to look at the
   stars--some countryman who has always been able to see. Perhaps he does
   not make any remark, or he simply says, "Oh, I have gone across the
   moor many a night! I don't see anything particular in the stars." But
   here is an old man brought from the Ophthalmic Hospital! He has been
   blind for many years. In fact, he forgets whether he ever could see. By
   a skillful operation, the film is taken from his eyes.

   Take him out at night and the first things he sees are the stars! He
   says, "What a sight! How glorious! How Divine!" Those are the kind of
   people to whom it is a joy to preach, for when the Lord gives sight to
   those who were blind and they see for the first time, how glad they are
   to see Him! Persons who do not often have flowers are charmed with the
   sight of them and find much delight in their fragrance. Yet I have
   heard of a flower girl who sold violets in the street and had to take
   those that remained home to her poor miserable room every night till
   she said that she hated the smell of violets! She could not bear them,
   having got so accustomed to them.

   "That is strange," says one, yet that is how some of our Gospel hearers
   speak. They say that we preach too long and they begin to criticize our
   sermons. I dread above anything that your nostrils should become so
   familiar with the sweet smell of the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the
   Valleys that their fragrance should become nauseous to you! How sad it
   would be that any of you should get so familiar with the Gospel that,
   at last, you would say, "What a weariness it is!"

   May this never be the case and, lest it should, come, now, and bring
   your case before Christ! It is no use to bring it before me and let me
   preach to you. It is no use to bring it before the mere means of Grace!
   Turn to the Lord Jesus, who is beside you, and tell Him all the
   case--say to Him that you renounce all other hope and trust yourself in
   His hands. Believe in Him this moment, lest haply the very Gospel,
   itself, should be a "savor of death unto death" to you. If you trust to
   Christ, you must have life! O Spirit of God, help many to come this
   very hour and trust in the Crucified, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Mark 9.
     __________________________________________________________________

A Clarion Call to Saints and Sinners

   (No. 2225)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 11, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   2, 1891.

   "Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
   polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction." Micah
   2:10.

   THERE is a miserable tendency in men to cling to things that are seen.
   Though that which we behold is only temporal and shadowy, lacking any
   true substance or permanence--though the things round about us can only
   endure for a little while and then will vanish away--yet we give our
   hearts to them and are ensnared by their false glitter and glamour.
   Like the poor birds that light on birdlime and cannot get away, we are
   entangled by the things of time and sense, instead of rising, as on
   eagle wings, to a higher sphere. Forgetting that the soul of man cannot
   be satisfied with the poor baubles of earth, nor his yearning heart
   filled with the fleeting joys of time, we often put away from us the
   things that are unseen and eternal. One of the most necessary words for
   us to hear at such a time is this, "Arise you, and depart; for this is
   not your rest."

   Suppose that the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt and
   were on the way to Canaan, instead of living in tents and moving as the
   fiery cloudy pillar guided them, had taken it into their heads to build
   houses and cities and temples wherever they stopped--as if they were to
   stop in the wilderness forever? Would they not have missed much by such
   a plan? In the wilderness, not only would all who came out of Egypt
   have perished, but their children and their children's children would
   also have found graves in the desert, nor ever have seen the goodly
   land promised to their fathers. On the contrary, as you know, they
   lived in their canvas cities and when the cloud moved, every tent was
   struck, and they began the march. When the cloud halted, they rested
   under canvas, never knowing how long they would continue in any one
   place, always expecting that they would be on the move, again, seeing
   that they had not yet come to the land that flowed with milk and honey.
   They well knew that in the wilderness was no abiding place for them,
   for the sand which was all around them yielded them no meat--and if
   their food had not dropped from above, they would have had no supply
   from the barren desert. They were strangers and pilgrims with God--and
   sojourners--as were their fathers.

   Now, our sad tendency is to be building cities, digging out
   foundations, laying courses of brick and saying, "Here I am going to
   rest. I have journeyed long enough and now I have come to a place where
   I can say, 'Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years. Take your
   ease--eat, drink and be merry.'" It is a sorry business when the heirs
   of Heaven wish to dwell in the wilderness and when men who have an
   inheritance on the other side of Jordan forget the land that God has
   given them by Covenant and seek to enjoy their portion in this life! We
   do not wonder that the ungodly do so-- they may well make as much as
   they can of their little enjoyment here, for, unless they repent of
   their evil ways, that is all that they will ever have! I do not wonder
   that such as have their lot in this life should seek after carnal
   merriment, fleshly pleasures and the giddy dance. What more do they
   have? It is not astonishing to see the swine greedy at the trough,
   pushing one another aside as they struggle to get their mash. But when
   those who have been redeemed with a strong hand and an outstretched arm
   sink into worldly conformity, worse, because more deadening, than the
   slavery of Egypt, then, indeed, we see the sad havoc sin can work and
   mourn because of it.

   Unawakened men have not a thought above these minor things and yet, if
   they could for once shake off the spell that has lulled to sleep their
   immortal spirits and turned them into comrades of the brutes, they
   would begin to feel that this is not their rest and would hear a voice
   saying to them, "Arise you, and depart." Perhaps they would even
   answer, "I will arise and go to my Father. I will leave the husks with
   which I gladly would have filled myself, and I will eat of the bread,

   whereof in my Father's house there is enough and to spare." But the
   trumpet call to "arise" is not only needed by prodigals in the far
   country! Careless professors who once ran well, but have been hindered,
   and who now rest content with the world, as if they were to stay here
   forever, require to be awakened from their slumber. "Awake you that
   sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light." God
   means His Church to be a separated people on the earth. Our citizenship
   is in Heaven, yet too many of us and, perhaps, all of us, at times,
   fall into the ways of the unregenerate and have fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness--even if we, ourselves, do not do them.
   Because of this slothful and carnal tendency, even in the best of us,
   it is continually necessary that the awakening call should come, "Arise
   you, and depart; for this is not your rest."

   I am going to talk, first, to God's people and sound an alarm for them.
   Then I shall have a word for awakened sinners and shall also sound the
   trumpet in their midst.

   I. First, I shall view the text as A CLARION NOTE FOR BELIEVERS IN
   CHRIST. As a soldier hears the bugle in the early morning and starts up
   ready for the duty of the day, so may every servant of Christ who hears
   these words, arise girded for service! The soldier, at the sound of the
   awakening call, must forsake the warmest bed and turn out to take his
   place in the ranks. With hope of a similar result would I sound the
   trumpet today. Let the clarion note ring out shrill and clear, "Arise
   you, and depart."

   To begin, I remark that there are occasions when this call comes
   especially to us. It may be heard in our everyday life above the din
   and bustle, but it is most needed when, perhaps, we are least inclined
   to listen to it. "Arise you, and depart." This note needs to be sounded
   in the ears of saints when they begin to be comfortable. When you have
   been going up the Hill Difficulty with a very heavy pull, you have come
   to the arbor on the side of the hill which has a seat very hospitably
   provided by the Lord of the Way. There is a table put in front of the
   seat so that you can sit down and, if so minded, put your arms on the
   table and have a good nap. Now, these arbors are built for the
   refreshment of pilgrims, but they are not meant for them to sleep in!
   They may sit still and gather strength with which to go on up the hill.
   They may look back and be grateful that they have climbed so far. But
   they must not go to sleep! If they do, it will happen to them as it did
   to one Christian of whom Mr. Bunyan wrote, who lost his roll of
   assurance, there, and had to come back and search for it with many
   tears. If any of you are very comfortable just now and things are going
   well with you. If, after a long struggle, the tide has now turned and
   you are floating along without needing either oar or sail, I would
   caution you to beware--

   "For more the treacherous calm I dread Than tempests bursting over my
   head."

   Dear child of God, when you begin to be very comfortable, unless you
   take care to be very grateful and sanctify your prosperity, you will be
   likely to drift into a sad state. I take down the trumpet and venture
   to come very close to you and, though it may seem a rude thing to blow
   a blast right in your ear, yet I will do it! And this is the
   sound--"Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest." God has
   given you many blessings, but you will turn them into curses if you
   make them to be your god. Jonah had a gourd, but when he made a god of
   his gourd, it was very soon withered! Take heed when all things go well
   with you here below, lest you begin to be glued to this world and find
   your comfort here. It will not do-- God will not permit it! If you say,
   like David, in his prosperity, "I shall never be moved. Lord, by Your
   favor You have made my mountain to stand strong," you may soon have to
   add like he, "You did hide Your face, and I was troubled."

   This note, also, is very necessary in the ears of Christian people when
   they begin to fraternize with the world. Nothing but evil can come of
   such association, for, "what communion has light with darkness? And
   what concord has Christ with Belial?" But you will say, "We have had
   some nice company lately. We have invited to our house some very decent
   people. It is true that we had no family prayer that night--we could
   not bring out the Bible and read a chapter before them, for we did not
   know if they would like it. But, in spite of that, they were a nice
   sort of people. We are going to their house another night--we do not
   quite know how they will propose to spend the evening, but we shall
   have to put up with their way of doing things because, you see, if you
   are in the world, you must do as the world does."

   Now, Friends, I shall, without asking your leave, blow my trumpet on
   both sides of your head! And I shall give a very loud blast, too, as my
   friend, Mr. Manton Smith, sometimes does when he uses his silver
   cornet. "Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it
   is polluted!" Beware when the world loves you, lest that which attracts
   them towards you is something that ought not to be there! Beware when
   men of the world are very fond of your society, for

   then surely you must have got out of touch with your Master, who says,
   "If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because
   you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
   therefore the world hates you." It is well, if consistent with
   righteousness, to have everybody's love, but when saints begin to be
   the admiration of the ungodly, depend upon it, there is something about
   them that God does not admire--there is an unhallowed conformity that
   is a signal of danger!

   When the world patronizes the Church, the Church will need tenfold
   Grace to maintain her spirituality, just as on an ocean steamer any
   speed beyond a certain limit is only attained by an expenditure of
   power altogether out of proportion to the increase of the distance
   traveled. "Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!" Such
   praise is not for good soldiers of Jesus Christ! If the enemy begins to
   love one of the king's generals, the king may half suspect that his
   general is turning traitor. God save us from such treachery! "Love not
   the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves
   the world, the love of the Father is not in him." So again I sound the
   trumpet--"Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest."

   Perhaps there are some who are neither beginning to be comfortable, nor
   to fraternize with the world, but to whom this trumpet note will still
   come with special emphasis, for the Lord's people need this call when
   they dream of long life on earth. You may, perhaps, have lived a long
   time, now, without any sickness or illness. You are certainly getting a
   little gray, your hair tells of the passing of years. Still, your
   father lived to a good old age. So did your grandfather and you reckon
   that you, also, will live for a long time to come. You have heard, this
   last week, perhaps, of the deaths of several people who were younger
   than you, but you do not reckon upon dying. Far from it--you have not
   even made your will yet, nor have you anything in order for your
   departure. A long stretch of health has a tendency to make us think
   that we are immortal. But though we may imagine this to be the case,
   the worms do not think so! The wood which will make your coffin may
   already be sawn and the linen which will be your shroud may be all
   ready. There is a spot of land where you must lie unless the Lord
   should suddenly come to His Temple. Here, certainly, we have no
   continuing city and, therefore, we ought not to make this world our
   rest.

   Dear Friends who have been here one Sabbath have been called away
   before the next came round--and some who have seemed to be best in
   health have been the very persons who have gone first. Therefore, my
   Soul, stand on tiptoe--be not flat-footed as some beasts are--have your
   wings always ready for flight so that if your Lord should come at
   cockcrow, or at daybreak, or at midnight, you shall be equally ready,
   at His bidding, to be up and away! I sound for myself and for my
   beloved friends, this clarion note--"Boot and saddle, up and prepare!
   Arise you, and depart." To whom that note may come with greatest point
   I cannot tell, for I am no Prophet, but let it come to us all. Let none
   of us begin to strike root here below, for this is not our rest!

   Having thus sounded this note, I make a second remark. There is an
   argument by which this call is greatly strengthened. The bugle note
   "Arise you, and depart," is made doubly shrill by the statement that
   follows, "This is not your rest." You see, that is given as a reason
   for our action. The word, "for," which joins these two clauses of the
   text, is being used in the sense of, "because." At times this argument
   appeals to us with special force. Of this reason and these seasons let
   me now speak.

   Remember, child of God, that you have a rest of another sort. "This is
   not your rest." "There remains, therefore, a rest for the people of
   God." That happy home, that flourishing business is not to be your
   abiding place. You would not like the change, I am sure, if the best
   portion here below might be yours forever instead of your dwelling
   place up above--

   "Oh, the delights, the heavenly joys, The glories of the place Where
   Jesus sheds the brightest beams Of His o verflo wing Grace."

   What must it be to be there, where saints and angels find a Heaven in
   beholding the face of the Lord of Glory and paying their humble
   adoration before Him! O Sirs, if we had a palace here, below, and parks
   and gardens reaching too far for a man to travel through them in a
   day--yes, if we had all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of
   them--we would not even, then, say, "This is our rest," nor consent to
   exchange Heaven for such things as these! What is there that we could
   possess on this round globe, with all its treasures, at all comparable
   with the eternal felicity, the rivers of pleas-

   ure that are at God's right hand forevermore? As you attempt to make
   the comparison, you will, each one of you, say, "I must not and I
   cannot cleave to these poor things below, for my rest is not here.
   Thank God that it is not here!"

   I think you will hear this call very distinctly when troubles come.
   When a man begins to have pain of body. When the one who is dearer to
   him than his life, sickens before him and is carried to the grave. When
   everything goes amiss with him in business and daily life, he does not,
   then, so much need my trumpet, for he already has heard the call
   sounding very loudly and there are many things saying to him, "This is
   not your rest." He knows that it is not! He is so troubled that he
   begins to let loose of all earthly things. He is like one at sea,
   tossed up and down with the billows--wave upon wave comes rolling over
   him and he says, "Now I clearly see that this is not my rest." Come,
   then, tried child of God, at this moment! Let this Word of God sound as
   sweet music to you rather than as a disturbing trumpet blast. Let it be
   as a heart-note that can lull you to peace. "This is not your rest." Do
   not wonder, therefore, if you find thorns and thistles growing
   here--your paradise lies in another land where no thorn or trial shall
   be brought forth to trouble and annoy you--

   "There everlasting spring abides And never-withering flowers. Death,
   like a narrow sea, divides

   This heavenly land from ours."

   The troubles of this life cause us to hasten forward to cross that
   Jordan and the call is thus all the more powerful. "Arise you, and
   depart; for this is not your rest."

   We hear this same note when success is enjoyed. I think that the time
   in which I have been most humbled before God and in which I have been
   lowest in spirit, is the time when mercies have been multiplied and I
   have met with some great success. Though it seems very strange, I look
   back upon the hours which have immediately followed some great triumph
   in the service of my Lord as the saddest which I have spent. I could
   fight my Lord's battles with both hands, but when the day was won,
   those same hands seemed nerveless. When this House of Prayer was being
   built, I was able to face every difficulty, as it arose, full of
   earnestness, zeal and with unshaken confidence! But when the place was
   opened and the work completed, I felt like Elijah who was faint after
   he had done the Master's service with the priests of Baal.

   Ah, dear Friends, God has only to give you what you want to make you
   feel the emptiness of it! If you are His child, the more you have the
   less you will see in it. The child of God who has possessions in this
   life, is just the man who says, "Vanity of vanities; all is vanity!"
   When you look at that which has been bestowed, you say, "Why was I so
   anxious to get this? I thank God for it, as His gift, but there is
   nothing in it apart from His giving it to me! Toil and trouble and care
   come with increase of goods. This, this is not my rest." If any young
   man here thinks that if he gets on in business and reaches a point when
   he can retire upon a competence, he will then have reached his rest, he
   is very greatly mistaken! If he is a child of God and if he gets all
   that his heart wishes for, he will find that there is nothing
   satisfying in it whatever. There is, in God, an all-sufficiency, but in
   all the things of this life, apart from the Grace of God, there is no
   solid satisfaction or rest!

   Beloved, I am sure that we feel that this is not our rest when we have
   gracious seasons. Do we not sometimes sit in this House of Prayer and
   feel as if we would like to sit here forever? Last Sunday morning, when
   I had done preaching, Brother Stott said that he did not want to go. He
   said that his willing soul would stay in such a frame as this and I
   suspect that there were a great many more in the congregation who, like
   the preacher, felt the same! A Brother was describing to me the effect
   of a certain amusement upon him--a very proper amusement in which there
   was no wrong what-ever--but he said, "Well, you know, I felt like a man
   who had gone out of a warm house into the cold. There was nothing in it
   for me, though I saw others very much enjoying it. But I have been used
   to better things than that and I cannot get on with it." I believe that
   such is the experience of all God's people who delight themselves in
   Him, with reference to the pleasures of the worldly.

   You will generally notice that when the Believer gets near to God,
   tastes the unseen joys and eats the bread that was made in Heaven, all
   the feasts of earth, all its amusements and all its glories seem very
   flat, stale and unprofitable! It is like drinking ditch water after
   having slaked your thirst from the cool brooks that come from the snows
   of Lebanon! After having laid our heads on Jesus' bosom, we feel, with
   regard to the world, "No, this is not our rest." We have laid hold on
   something better, more substantial, more satisfying and enduring--and
   when we come to the best the world can give, we, somehow, turn our
   backs upon it and cry--"This is not our rest."

   Surely we feel this strongly and hear very clearly the clarion note,
   "Arise you, and depart," when our many friends are taken Home. I can
   scarcely look upon any part of the Tabernacle without saying to myself,
   "Such a friend used to sit there, and such a friend there, and here,
   behind me, certain of my kind and good Elders and Deacons used to sit."
   I cannot look round without missing many. When you got well on in
   years, you will find that your best friends are on the other side of
   the river and that some of the dearest you have had are gone before
   you. When you think of it, you say to yourself, "I, too, must arise and
   depart; for this is not my rest." I have heard that sailors, when they
   leave England, drink to the health of those they leave behind them till
   they get a certain distance. And within so many weeks of the port to
   which they are sailing they change the toast and drink to the health of
   those that are before them, whom they hope soon to see. It might be
   better for the sailors and none the worse for their friends if they
   grasped the idea that such drinking tends to the health of neither, but
   such I understand is their custom and, undoubtedly there is such a
   change of outlook in the Christian life. I have nearly reached that
   state in which I am thinking more of those before me than of those
   behind me or with me! We are looking forward to the grand reunion when
   those who went before us shall again appear and we shall, with them, be
   welcomed by our Lord into everlasting habitations! With such
   anticipations we can rejoice to hear the bugle sound again and again,
   "Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest."

   In the third place, notice that there is a fact by which this call is
   further enforced. In the text there is another expression which puts
   confidence into this bugle note and gives us a new reason for
   continuing our pilgrim march. The reasons which exist in ourselves for
   answering the trumpet call are not the only ones--others may be found
   all around us--and I ask your attention to this for a moment. "This is
   not your rest: because it is polluted." You cannot go out into the
   world without feeling that it is polluted--therefore heed well the Word
   of God which comes to you, "Arise you and depart."

   The call receives new strength by the pollution which is around us.
   Where do you live? You are a very happy man if you live in a part of
   London which is not defiled. Can you go down any of our streets without
   hearing conversation that makes you feel that the place is polluted?
   This region, indeed, I may say with deep sorrow, is polluted! And there
   are still lower depths. The newspapers bear daily testimony to the
   awful extent the pollution has reached. And the terrible poison seems
   to be continually spreading. Do you not feel, if you know anything of
   the Grace of God, that you cannot forever live in the midst of such
   evil? Even Lot, among the people of Sodom, "dwelling among them, in
   seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
   unlawful deeds." To him, one day, there came, by angelic messengers,
   the call to arise and depart! In his heart of hearts he must have been
   glad to get away! We, too, because of the pollution that surrounds us,
   should learn that this is not our rest.

   But what shall I say of the way in which the call is enforced by the
   pollution which comes home to us, even the defilement of our own house,
   of our own business and of our own daily experience? I am sure that if
   you look well into it, you will see sin in even your holy things! And
   if there is sin in your holy things, certainly there will be much that
   grieves God and should grieve you in your ordinary daily life. Within
   your domestic circle you may have those that make you feel, "This is
   not your rest: because it is polluted." You have those whom you love,
   for whom you pray with deep anxiety, who make you often realize that
   your relationships in life are both strained and stained. How many a
   godly man has to say with David, "Although my house is not so with God;
   yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things
   and sure"! Yes, this is not our rest--the evil comes into such close
   contact with us that we long to be away from it all! We seek to arise
   and depart from the pollution which seems to cling to us like a wet
   garment. Thus the call is greatly enforced.

   It becomes more forcible because of the holiness for which we sigh.
   Look at your own heart. Examine your own thoughts, your own words and
   even those actions which are right in motive. How often pride comes in!
   You say to yourselves, "I did that very well, indeed," and then the
   good deed becomes polluted, for you trust in yourself and distrust God.
   And the little self-confidence, or the little lack of faith in God will
   soon pollute that which you bring to the Lord. Oh, no, we can never
   rest till we got where there is no sin!--

   "Then shall I see, hear and know All I desired or wished below,"

   but we shall never be content until we get up where Satan cannot tempt
   and where corruption will be done with forever--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin! With God eternally shut in!"

   Blow the bugle again! Ring out the note with clarion clearness--"Arise
   you, and depart; for this is not your rest; because it is polluted."

   In the fourth place, we must not forgot that there is a danger by which
   this call is rendered loudest. There is one more note that gives new
   intensity to it, when it is added, "Because it is polluted, it shall
   destroy you, even with a sore destruction." Upon this I will say to the
   children of God that the things of this world are our destruction.
   There is nothing here that helps us on our way to God. It is a
   wilderness at the very best--

   "Pricking thorns through all the ground,

   And mortal poisons grow.

   And all the rivers that are found

   With dangerous waters flow."

   God keeps His own and preserves them to the end, but they get nothing
   out of this world save the discipline of avoiding it. Vain world! It is
   no friend to Grace! It does not help us on to God. Were it not for
   Grace, it would be our destruction!

   Look at the temptations around you. Are you ever forced to cry, "Good
   Lord, help me"? Remember Bunyan's pilgrim, Mr. Stand-Fast, when Madame
   Bubble encountered him? It was on the Enchanted Ground that she met him
   and offered him her purse and all manner of carnal delights. What did
   poor Stand-Fast do? In an agony he fell down and prayed! Because he was
   poor, he was tempted by her purse and his heart began to go after
   vanity--what could he do but kneel down and pray? Ah, this is not your
   rest! It is a place for wrestling rather than for resting! A place for
   prayer, not for sleep! It is not your rest, for it is polluted and,
   "because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore
   destruction," unless the Grace of God shall prevent it! Does not this
   consideration make the call become very loud?

   Have you not felt the deadening influence of the world? Can you busy
   people be up and down the city, or in your shops all day, without
   feeling that these things tend to harden you? Grace comes in and raises
   you above it, but the thing, itself, and the care and the thought that
   you are obliged to give to it have a tendency to make you sink instead
   of rise. How grateful you ought to be for your Sabbaths! And how
   thankful you should be for this little sanctuary in the middle of the
   week, this appointed evening when you can steal away and shake the
   earth off your feet and brush the dust from your clothes and go back to
   your toil refreshed and strengthened! God grant us Grace to live above
   the world! The world, itself, will not help us--it will be our
   destruction if we do not arise and join the company who "Ask the way to
   Zion with their faces toward it, saying, Come, and let us join
   ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be
   forgotten." Thus the call waxes long and loud.

   But it becomes loudest of all when we have to always mourn the fatal
   effect of worldliness in others. When I look over the Church Book,
   sometimes I cannot help shedding tears. There is the name of a Brother
   who used to pray so sweet-ly--where has he gone? There is the name of a
   Sister who used to be one of the most earnest followers of
   Christ--where is she now? I should hardly like to know where they are
   and yet they did once seem to run well. I remember a Brother who fell
   into gross sin, of whom I never heard any more, and one said, "If that
   man is not a child of God, I am not one, myself." I could not help
   saying, "Hush, hush! Do not talk of staking your soul against any other
   man's. You know but little about yourself and you do not know anything
   about him."

   I do not like to hear such a thing said and yet I have known some of
   whom I could almost have said the same! We have thought, "He must be a
   child of God" but, after all, the man has turned aside to crooked ways
   and proved that he never had the Grace of God in his heart. Ah, dear
   Friends, while those things happen, "this is not your rest." As well
   seek for shelter in an enemy's country, or seek rest in a storm at sea,
   as expect to find anything like rest here. No, "Arise you, and depart;
   for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy
   you, even with a sore destruction," unless the God of Infinite Love and
   Mercy shall keep you as the apple of His eye!

   Thus I have spoken to those who are Believers in Christ. God bless
   them! Now I turn to others for the few minutes that remain.

   II. Secondly, my text may be viewed as AN AWAKENING NOTE FOR AWAKENED
   SINNERS. "Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest." In dealing
   with this head, I want to say a word to those who are thoughtful, but
   are not yet Believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. I desire to take my
   silver trumpet and come to each one of you and sound in your ear that
   same note which I tried to sound in the ears of God's people. "Arise
   you, and depart." Get up! Sleep no more! Lie in indifference no longer!
   God help you to say, "I will arise and go to my Father"! You must clear
   out of your present

   position or you will be lost. The name of the place where you now dwell
   is the City of Destruction and if you would escape, you must run from
   it. Flee from the wrath to come!

   You are called upon to depart from sin and self. You must, through
   Divine Grace, be ready to quit self and the righteousness that is of
   self--and sin and the follies that go with sin. "Arise you, and
   depart." O man, or woman, if you stay where you are by nature, you stay
   in a land which, like Sodom and Gomorrah, is given up to destruction by
   fire from Heaven! "Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither
   stay you in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you be
   consumed." You that are in a state of nature, a state of guilt and
   condemnation, arise you and depart. "Seek you the Lord while He may be
   found, call you upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his
   ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the
   Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will
   abundantly pardon."

   And here is the reason why you should thus arise and depart--you have
   found no rest in the world--"This is not your rest." I put it to
   you--have you found any true peace in the ways of sin? Ah, if you have
   been awakened to see your state before God, you know that you are not
   happy! How can you be? An immortal soul contort with mortal things?
   "Too low they build who build beneath the stars." He has a poor
   treasury who has not a treasury in Heaven. If all your possessions are
   here, it is a poor all, for you lose it when you die, or it may at any
   moment be taken from you while you live. You now have no rest. You know
   many men and women who may enjoy themselves as much as they can, so far
   as means are concerned, but they never really enjoy themselves at all.
   They used to get pleasure when they were younger, but now they go to
   the same places and they come away dissatisfied. I am glad of it. I am
   glad that the Lord will not allow them to find satisfaction in the joys
   of this life.

   And if you had a rest, here, you would soon have to leave it. What if
   you had to leave all you have tonight? What if, tonight, instead of my
   voice, it should be the angel who should sound the trumpet, "Arise you,
   and depart"? What if, instead of going home tonight, you went into the
   eternal state to meet your God and Judge? How would it be with you? How
   can you rest if you are unable to give a joyful answer to these
   questions? You are hanging over the mouth of Hell by a single thread
   and that thread is breaking! Only a gasp for breath, only a stopping of
   the heart for a single moment and you will be in an eternal world,
   without God, without hope, without forgiveness! Oh, can you face it? I
   pray God that you may not have a bronze countenance, but may feel that
   it is time for you to listen to the voice that says, "Arise you, and
   depart; for this is not your rest."

   But another reason why you should hasten to flee is because of the sins
   of your life. You have polluted it. And what happens to you? Why, the
   older you get, the more polluted you are! What a mercy it is that men
   do not live eight or nine hundred years, now, as they used to do! What
   monsters of sin would be on the earth if men kept on doing evil at the
   rate some of them do now! Living 80 years, sinners get to be quite
   sufficiently putrid in talk and life. But if they lived 800 years, this
   world would almost be a second Hell! Well might God, in the olden days,
   wash the world clean when there were sinners upon it so ripe for
   destruction, so rotten in their lives! Because sin thus fouls your
   nest, "Arise you, and depart."

   With all the earnestness of my heart would I urge you to arise from
   your sin and hasten away from your peril, for destruction threatens
   you. You that have sinned cannot afford to always live here, for, even
   now, your sins begin to come home to you. They will come home even more
   as you grow older. When sickness begins to take away your spirits and
   departed health leaves you without the possibility of your present
   joys, your state will be almost too terrible for contemplation! Oh, I
   would not be the man who has lived a sinful life and who is about to
   die without hope! A pack of wolves around a man must be nothing to it!
   I heard the other day of one, in India, who was thought to be dead and
   the Parsee method, you know, is not to bury their dead--they leave them
   naked in what are called the "Towers of Silence," where there are
   vultures always waiting and, within three or four hours after a corpse
   is laid there, there is no flesh left upon the bones.

   One poor man, who was only in a swoon, was thought to be dead and was
   laid out in the tower. The vultures came and one or two of them tore
   his flesh so terribly that he started up as from a dreadful dream!
   There were the vultures coming to devour him while he was yet alive
   and, defending himself as best he could, he managed to escape. What a
   plight to be in, lying in the place of the dead, surrounded by the
   cruel beaks of those fierce, ravenous birds! But in a far more awful
   position is a sinner when his sins come home to him. Only the Lord can
   drive those vultures away and restore him

   to life and safety. He comes for your deliverance and it is His voice
   that says, today, "Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest."
   Fly to Him now, for if not, this rest of yours that you seem to have,
   will destroy you! You will grow more worldly and more callous as the
   years go on!

   He that is filthy will become yet more filthy! As an old man, you will
   say, "It is no use talking to me. If I could have my curly hair back
   again and sit on my mother's knee once more, I might feel something,
   but now I am given up to hardness." The world will ruin you as the
   world has ruined its millions and is still ruining its thousands! Fly
   to Jesus, fly to Jesus! Sinner, fly this moment! God help you! I shall
   be well rewarded for having preached if but one soul should be awakened
   to flee away to Christ, my Lord! And why should not many more, in
   answer to our prayers? The Lord bless you, for Jesus Christ's sake!
   Amen.

"Lay Hold on Eternal Life!"

   (No. 2226)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 18, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   19, 1891.

   "Lay hold on eternal life." 1 Timothy 6:12.

   PAUL was very anxious about Timothy, his own son in the faith. He loved
   him greatly and he had much confidence in him, but still he felt that
   the work of preaching the Gospel was such a responsible undertaking
   that he could not be too prayerful for him, nor too earnest in
   exhorting him to continued steadfastness in those things which he had
   received. So "the old man eloquent," whose very pen seems to have
   borrowed some of the burning fervor of his heart, pours out his very
   soul to young Timothy in the earnest desire that he may find in him a
   true successor--one who, when Paul is compelled to lay down his
   trusteeship--will take it up and be faithful to his Lord and to the
   Gospel when his father in Christ is taken away from him. We cannot be
   too anxious about our young Brothers who are to preach the Gospel of
   the Grace of God. Always pray for students! Let them continually be
   mentioned in your private prayers than when those who have borne the
   burden and heat of the day shall rest with their fathers, God may raise
   up better men than they, who shall yet more faithfully proclaim His
   Word.

   This passage of Scripture, "Lay hold on eternal life," is suggestive
   from its connection. In the same verse Timothy is told to, "Fight the
   good fight of faith." From this it is evident that if he lays hold on
   eternal life, he will have to fight for it and that if he has to fight,
   he can only fight by laying hold upon eternal life with a tenacious
   grip. Every Christian man is a soldier and no man will war a good
   warfare unless he lays hold upon eternal life with all his heart and
   soul. A man may fight the battles of earth with the life of earth, but
   our warfare is of a different kind--"For we wrestle not against flesh
   and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
   rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
   high places." With such foes we can only contend successfully when we
   are made invulnerable by the reception of the life of God within our
   souls. In a classic story we read of one who was dipped in the river
   Styx before he went forth to the battle so that the arrows of the foe
   might fall harmless about him. That fable becomes a fact for us when we
   "lay hold on eternal life." The fiery darts of the wicked are quenched
   by our shield of faith!

   The whole chapter forms a sort of preface to the text. Three classes of
   people seem to have existed in the community where Timothy was called
   to labor--each with different views of the best method of teaching
   those around them. First of all, there were some who intermeddled with
   social politics. They told the slaves that they might conspire against
   their masters and try to rectify the unquestionable wrongs which
   existed in that day. Paul desires, as much as anybody could, that
   injustice should come to an end and especially that slavery should be
   swept off the face of the earth, as it has largely been by the
   influence of the Gospel. But, taught of God, and seeing that it was by
   the proclamation of the Gospel that these evils would be most surely
   overcome--rather than by any hasty social change--he says to Timothy,
   "Leave that matter alone. Lay hold on eternal life! You are not sent to
   cleanse the Augean stable of politics and to set things socially
   right--let it be sufficient for you to lay hold on eternal life and to
   call upon the people to do the same. Every man to his own calling and
   this is yours, "Lay hold on eternal life." Today many a young preacher
   and, perhaps some of the older ones, would do well to take heed to this
   advice of Paul given by the Spirit, for while every real social
   improvement, based on the principles of right and justice must have the
   sympathy of all Christian men, depend upon it that, in the long run,
   the surest way to raise men is to preach the Gospel to them! This will
   change their character and regenerated lives will soon result in
   altered social conditions.

   Round about Timothy, too, there buzzed a set of men full of questions
   and difficulties--and discoveries of a false science which Paul calls,
   "profane and vain babblings." These were in a most unhealthy state,
   "sick about questionings and disputes of words," as the Apostle's
   language in verse four may be literally rendered. Concerning such, he
   says to Timothy, "Do not answer such wrangling of men corrupted in mind
   and bereft of the Truth of God. Do not worry yourself about them! Let
   the bees or the wasps buzz as much as they like. As for you, lay hold
   on eternal life! Stick to your business. Go in for the one thing for
   which God has called you, the glorious work of saving souls! Let those
   who like such questions fight them out to the bitter end, but, as for
   you, lay hold on eternal life!"

   Then Paul had noticed that, at Ephesus, there were certain men who were
   striving to be rich. Certain men, even of the members of the Church,
   who seemed to be sacrificing everything else for gain. They were
   counting that gain was godliness and that if they could get rich, they
   really were the better men for it. But Paul says to Timothy, "Leave
   money alone. Having food and raiment, let us be content. Your hand is
   not big enough to lay hold of two things. Therefore, since you can only
   have one, see that it is the vital thing. Lay hold on eternal life!" To
   use the rough old proverb, "Let the cobbler stick to his last."
   "Timothy, stick to your business! Lay hold on eternal life--that is
   your main concern-- 'Whereunto you are also called and have professed a
   good profession before many witnesses.'"

   I like this plain dealing of the Apostle. He seems to say, "Come to the
   all-important point, Timothy, and stick to it. Let others go in for
   this, and that, and the other--but as for you, set before yourself the
   highest aim. Say to them, as I wrote to the Philippians last year from
   Rome, 'This one thing I do'--'Lay hold on eternal life.'"

   The great complaint which we have to make against many is that they
   seem to be looking after the odds and ends, the paraphernalia, the
   minor affairs of life. They do not seem to aim at this point--eternal
   life! Is it not so in praying? Is there not much that passes by the
   name which is not real prayer? We might often say, "Get to the point,
   Man, and ask of God what you need! Come to real prayer and downright
   grips with the Angel! Wrestle with Him and prevail!"

   Paul seems, also, to hint that there was in the preaching, even in his
   day, a great deal that was extraneous, ornamental, superfluous--and so
   he says to young Timothy, "Aim at the center of the target. Go in for
   this, the main business, first of all--lay hold on eternal life!

   How much there is of our prayer which is only language. How much of our
   praise which is only music! How much there is in our Churches which is
   something that may have to do with the betterment of the people, but is
   not salvation, not winning souls for Christ! How much there is of
   teaching which may be Christian teaching, but is not the teaching of
   Christ! But here we clearly see that the Apostle focused everything to
   this one point and brought Timothy to this one thing--that he should
   "lay hold on eternal life"--and having laid hold on it, himself, should
   then set it forth before others with such vehemence and strong emphasis
   that they, also, might be persuaded to lay hold on it and be saved!

   Oh, my dear Hearers! What does it matter what I have preached to you
   unless you get eternal life? What does it matter how I have said this
   or that to you, unless you have received, at the hand of my Master,
   that life-giving stream which shall be in you "a well of water
   springing up into everlasting life"? With all your getting, I beseech
   you, get the understanding of the great mystery of godliness and become
   wise as to the life which is life, indeed!

   I am now going to take this exhortation and press it upon each one here
   present, asking God to bless it. "Lay hold on eternal life."

   I. First, then, WHAT IS ETERNAL LIFE?

   In attempting to answer this question, I remark what should be
   perfectly obvious--it is a gift of God--the fruit of a Divine operation
   upon the heart. One of the first works of the Grace of God is to put
   within us eternal life. No man can create it, either in himself, or in
   his fellow men. Just as our physical life was bestowed upon us apart
   from any effort of our own, the Divine life cannot be evolved by any
   device of man--it must be imparted by the Spirit of God. At first, God
   created man "and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
   became a living soul." And when, in Christ, man becomes a new creation,
   the work is as wholly and as really God's. Eternal life is what no man
   has by nature, for he is dead in sin. No man can earn it, for carnal
   works cannot purchase a spiritual gift. And if a man toiled for a whole
   eternity, he would be no nearer the possession of eternal life than
   when he began.

   That it does not come by effort is clear, for how shall the dead, by
   any kind of effort, if effort they could make, attain to life? It does
   not come by outward ceremonies--these could never purchase that which
   God bestows freely. Yet how natural it is to the proud heart of man to
   seek to make payment for that which is to be obtained without money and

   without price! It is strange that men should expect God to take their
   gift when they refuse to accept His! If they would but remember that
   all their giving cannot enrich God--that they cannot give Him anything
   that He does not already possess--it would be quite evident to them
   that eternal life can come in no other way than by the gift of God! It
   is foolish to try to fill an already full vessel! It is profane as well
   as foolish to seek to be saved by giving to God instead of receiving
   from Him, or by anything we can bring to attempt to buy this eternal
   life. This is to imitate Simon Magus, to whom Peter said, "Your money
   perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be
   purchased with money." Neither with money nor with ceremonies can it be
   purchased. It is purely and solely the gift of God by Jesus Christ.
   "The wages of sin is death; but the gift"--the free gift--"of God is
   eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."--

   "Life is found alone in Jesus,

   Only there 'tis offered thee--

   Offered without price or money'

   'Tis the gift of God sent free!

   Take salvation,

   Take it now and happy be."

   This eternal life, given thus freely, is a present possession. "Eternal
   life" may sometimes be employed to set out the glories of Heaven, but
   not often--it is a thing possessed here. In the day in which we are
   regenerated, we receive the first germs of this everlasting life. When
   we are born again, it is, "not of corruptible seed, but of
   incorruptible, by the Word of God, which lives and abides forever." It
   is a gift of God, a gift not reserved for the future, but given now,
   the moment a sinner believes in Christ! One of the first tokens of
   eternal life being given is the cry of prayer--and then come repentance
   of sin--and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. This is eternal life--the
   gift of God and a present possession. Have you received it? I do not
   ask you whether you know exactly the day or the hour when you received
   it, but are you alive unto God with a life you had not by nature, but
   which has been planted in you by God the Holy Spirit?

   This life is, in fact, the life of God in the soul. The Holy Spirit
   comes and breathes God's life into dead men. There is nothing
   everlasting in itself but God--and there is no life that is everlasting
   except that which comes from the Everlasting One! The gift of God is
   not only the gift God gives, but God is the gift that is given! He it
   is who breathes into us this eternal life which is really Christ living
   in us! He, Himself, is "that eternal life, which was with the Father,
   and was manifested unto us." The Holy Spirit comes and dwells in the
   man! "We will come to him," says Christ, "and take up Our abode with
   him." The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, each in a certain way,
   comes and dwells within the man--he becomes a Temple of the Holy Spirit
   and so he is alive unto God.

   Again, eternal life is a life which never dies. We speak very
   positively here. Eternal life cannot have an end! If it can come to an
   end by any process, whatever, then it is not eternal! This is as clear
   as words can make it. The life, then, which God gives to every soul in
   its regeneration, can never die! Hear these words of Christ--"My sheep
   hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: and I give unto
   them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man
   pluck them out of My hand." We do not teach that if the life of God in
   a Believer were to die out, he could, nevertheless, be saved. No
   Scripture teaches that!

   We teach that if there is the life of God in a man, it is eternal--not
   only that it is going to be eternal, but that now, in its nature and
   essence, it is eternal and can be nothing but eternal life and,
   therefore, can never come to an end! It may be lessened; it may be
   sick; it may be obscure; but if it is there, since it is eternal life,
   it cannot come to an end! If it did, it could by no possibility be
   correctly said to be eternal life at all. Do you see, then, what a
   blessing is yours if you have received the gift of God? If by Grace you
   have received life through Jesus Christ, you have a life which will
   never die, a life which will outlast the sun and moon! You will see
   this world turned to a black coal. You will see all things expire, but
   your life and the life of God shall run on forever and ever. Well might
   Paul urge Timothy and well may we urge you to lay hold on such a life
   as this. So--

   "Take, with rejoicing, from Jesus at once The life everlasting He
   gives! And know, with assurance, you never can die, Since Jesus, your
   righteousness, lives." Once more, this eternal life is the life that is
   perfected in Glory. It goes on developing and matures, even in this
   world, to a very high degree. There is a very great difference between
   the new-born babe and the full-grown man and there is a

   great difference between the Believer who has just received eternal
   life and that riper saint who has come to the fullness of the stature
   of a man in Christ Jesus. But it is the same life! It is the same life
   that says, "God be merciful to me a sinner," which afterwards says, "I
   know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto Him against that day." It is the same
   life, but a fuller measure thereof. One is life, the other is life more
   abundant. As certainly as the eternal life begins, even in the tiniest
   bud, so will it blossom and become fruitful until it comes to its full
   perfection in Glory. The life of Believers in Heaven, the life that
   never sins, the life that is absolute obedience, the life that is
   undiluted bliss is exactly the same life that is in the Believer right
   now! The same life that God gave him when he first believed is that
   with which he beholds the face of God--without a veil between them--as
   he treads the golden streets of the New Jerusalem!

   This, then, is eternal life--a new principle, a Divine principle, an
   inexhaustible, unquenchable, immortal principle. He that has it is
   blessed, indeed, among the sons of men! He that has it not is dead
   while he lives!

   Having thus considered the nature of this possession, we come back to
   the question we have already asked --Have we this eternal life? Have we
   received it as God's gift? Is it, within our hearts, a lamp burning
   there, never to be put out? Do we know its present power and reality
   and have we joy therein? Yes, do we delight ourselves in God, who has
   brought us out of death into life--out of the region of the Valley of
   the Shadow of Death into that great light which is the beginning of
   Heaven, the dawn of the day that shall never end? If we do, let us
   unitedly lift up our hearts in praise and say, "Thanks be unto God for
   His unspeakable gift!" Can we ever cease to adore His name, since He
   has bestowed such a treasure upon us? But if you have not yet become a
   possessor of it, I beseech you at this moment to hold out your empty
   hands and take the gift so freely offered! "And this is the record,
   that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He
   that has the Son has life, but he that has not the Son of God has not
   life."

   II. In the second place, the Apostle tells us to "lay hold on" eternal
   life. That is the main point of my present discourse. How DO WE LAY
   HOLD ON ETERNAL LIFE? There are degrees in the reception of this life,
   but happy is the man who fully apprehends that for which he is also
   "apprehended of Christ Jesus." The Spirit of God lays hold of us in
   order that we may lay hold on eternal life! How we are enabled to do
   this is our present subject for consideration.

   First, if you would grasp this gift, believe in it as true. The very
   beginning of our hope is when the Lord leads us to believe that there
   is such a thing as eternal life--and that it is a tangible thing, not a
   dream or a vision--but a reality to be laid hold of. I certainly
   believe in the existence of a thing that I can lay hold upon. If
   "seeing is believing," laying hold is even a more thorough mode of
   believing! Believe, then, that there is a higher life than Nature can
   ever create. If unconverted, you do not know anything about this in
   your own experience, but there is such a thing. There is life in Christ
   which He can give you. There is life by the Holy Spirit which He can
   work in you. He can strip you of those grave clothes of sin and raise
   you from your tomb. The words which Christ once addressed to Martha
   still sound in our ears--"I am the resurrection and the life: he that
   believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whoever
   lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"

   Answer this question of my Master, "Do you believe this?" If you do,
   there is hope that you shall yet be a partaker of His Grace. Nothing
   can hinder when He begins to work! Though you feel as if you did not
   feel at all. Though you seem paralyzed and unable to repent or to
   believe--this life shall be given to you and it shall be given to you
   now if you look unto Him who was lifted up upon the Cross, that,
   "whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

   Believe, my Brothers and Sisters, you that have this eternal life, in
   the power and reality of it! And whenever Satan tempts you to think
   that it is a fiction, a dream, a piece of enthusiasm, an idea born of
   fanaticism--resist him by the plain testimony of the Word of God--and
   the abundant witness of those who have gone before you, rejoicing in
   the power of it! Every child of God has times when he questions
   himself, but he can still truly say, "I am not what I used to be. I
   have feelings both of pain and joy that come not of the old life, but
   of the new, which has come to me by God's gracious gift."--

   "Lord, I was dead. I could not stir My lifeless soul to come to Thee!
   But now, since You have quickened me, I rise from sin's dark
   sepulcher."

   If any of you have not yet experienced such a change, begin, as I have
   told you, by believing that there is such a thing as eternal life. I
   wish that you who have not yet obtained this blessing would make a
   point of regularly attending some

   place where the Gospel is preached, saying, "It is to be had and I will
   have it. It is to be had by faith. 'Faith comes by hearing.' I will be
   an earnest hearer! 'Hearing comes by the Word of God.' I will take care
   to read and hear only the Word of God, so that faith may come to me and
   life may come by faith, for there is such a thing as receiving a new
   and spiritual life that shall make me far other than by nature I am. I
   believe it is true." That is the first way of laying hold.

   But you do not lay hold of a thing by simply believing that there is
   such a thing! You must go farther. Appropriate it. There is a book and
   I believe that it is there, but if anybody told me that it was a
   present for me and said, "All that you have to do in order to have it
   is to lay hold upon it," I should understand that he meant not only
   that I was to believe in its existence, but that I was to take it up
   and carry it home with me. That is how you are to "lay hold on eternal
   life." Strange as it is, this is a thing which, though it is so simple,
   we cannot make awakened sinners understand! That eternal life is God's
   free gift put within their reach and that they are to take hold of it
   for their own salvation seems harder for some to grasp than if it were
   the most intricate puzzle! Yet this is, perhaps, the clearest aspect of
   the great matter of salvation.

   It was Dr. Chalmers, I think, who used to say that he had no such
   comfort in the Gospel as when he viewed it as a simple offer on the one
   side, and a simple acceptance on the other. God gives--and we take! The
   Lord who has been chastening you, making you feel your sinnership and
   showing you that you are condemned and only fit to die, now says, "Lay
   hold on eternal life. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Take Him to be
   yours. Accept Him as your Substitute, bearing the death justly your due
   and, having given His life for you, now giving it to you. Make the
   exchange! Christ took your death--take His life! He bore your
   evil--take His good! Appropriate it. Lay hold on eternal life." When
   people are sinking in the water and there is a life buoy or a rope
   near, they do not need much exhorting to lay hold upon it, nor any
   elaborate explanation of the way! They simply grip anything that gives
   them half a hope of being saved from the devouring deep. Now, Soul, you
   are not to bring anything with you. That would be to fill your hands
   and then you could not lay hold of anything else! You are to come
   empty-handed, just as you are, to Christ, who is set before you. Be
   bold enough to take Him and let Him be yours! You need no worthiness.
   How could you be worthy of Him? He gives Himself freely to your
   unworthiness and sinnership! Confess these and lay hold on eternal
   life--appropriate it to yourself.

   The exhortation means more than that, however. Having appropriated it,
   keep it. Hold to it and never let it go. Hide it in your heart as a
   choice treasure and, if any would rob you of it, or frown you out of
   it, or laugh at you because you prize so highly what they so lightly
   esteem, lay hold on it still more! This is the work of the Grace of God
   which enables you, first, to take and then to keep it! Oh, what efforts
   will be made from within and from without to get you to give up eternal
   life! But here comes, in the exhortation, "Cling to it. Hold fast by it
   constantly. As with a death grip, grasp it with new energy. If you have
   held it with one hand, hold it with both hands. Yet more and more lay
   hold on eternal life."

   And then, furthermore, keep yourself upon it. According to the text,
   you have to "Fight the good fight of faith." Every now and then you
   will get an ugly knock, a bruise, a bleeding wound from your enemy.
   What are you to do? Always lay hold on eternal life, again, and it will
   strengthen you, stanch your wounds and make you, once more, strong in
   the day of battle. I would have you think much of this. If you believe
   in Christ, there is a life within you, like the life of God, which will
   never die--a life within you which will bring you to stand before the
   glorious Throne of Christ, "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such
   thing." Do not, therefore, ever give up hope! Do not be staggered by
   what you may have to suffer here. In the midst of all the agony of the
   way, keep your heart upon God and upon the gift He has given you. "Lay
   hold on eternal life." If between here and Heaven you could be burned
   as a martyr every day, it would be worth your while to bear it, laying
   hold on eternal life--

   "The King abo ve in beauty, Without a veil is seen! It were a
   well-spent journey, Though ten deaths lay between."

   If between here and Heaven you had nothing to bear but the cruelty of
   men and the unkindness of the enemies of Christ, you should bear it
   right manfully, and even joyfully, because you can say, "I know in
   myself that I have in Heaven a better and an enduring substance. Even
   here I have a life which the world did not give me and cannot take from
   me-- therefore I hold to it, still, and I comfort myself with this
   sweet thought, that it is mine, the gift of God to me! It bears me up
   amid seas of grief. 'My flesh and my heart fail, but God is the
   strength of my heart and my portion forever.'"

   Further, I think that the Apostle, by the exhortation, "Lay hold on
   eternal life," meant, let other things go. Here is a Brother, lately
   converted, who has been accustomed to keep his shop open on Sundays. He
   lives in a street where the best business is to be done on that day and
   if he closes his shop he will very likely be a great loser. What should
   he do? I thank God that the man has not asked anybody what he should
   do--he has done the right thing and trusted in his God! The Apostle
   seems to say, "Let anything else go, let everything else go, but lay
   hold on eternal life. Hold to that." "Oh, but I should lose a living!"
   Yes, but if you lost a living and saved your life, what would you lose?
   Have you ever heard of the one who had a bag of gold on board a ship
   coming home from Australia? The ship was sinking and he went down to
   his cabin, put as much gold as he could into a belt, and then fastened
   the belt around his waist. When he leaped for the boat and missed it,
   it was not possible to pick him up, for he sank with the weight of his
   own gold round his loins! There was no hope for him--his treasure was
   his ruin!

   And many a man, in like manner, is, by all his toil, but preparing sure
   destruction for himself--toiling and working hard only that he may
   effectually ruin his own soul! Let these things go. "For what is a man
   advantaged if he gains the whole world and loses himself, or is cast
   away?" Even for the fleeting life of the body, a man will sacrifice
   all, thankful if he can get out of the burning house alive, though all
   his worldly goods are destroyed--glad to escape from the hands of the
   brigands, though they strip him of every possession. "All that a man
   has will he give for his life." If this is wise for a transient life,
   how much more for the life which is eternal! We shall be gainers by
   losing everything, if by the loss we gain everlasting bliss! Let all
   that opposes go--friends, kindred, comfort, this present life--let them
   all go if, by the sacrifice, we may more firmly lay hold on eternal
   life! To keep that--and hold fast to it amidst the stress of
   temptation--is the main business of the Christian man! "Lay hold on
   eternal life."

   And it means, in my text, more than that. Fight, and as you fight, lay
   hold upon the victory. While you are running for Heaven, often
   anticipate the joys of Heaven. I think you and I do not go to Heaven
   often enough. "Well" says one, "I thought we should go there when we
   died." Yes, if you are a Believer in Christ, that is secure, but why
   not go there now? The Christian's position is unique--he is in two
   worlds at once! Our Lord has quickened us, "and has raised us up
   together and made us sit together in the heavenlies in Christ." Do you
   not know that the lower ends of all the streets of Heaven are near
   here? Victory--that is Heaven! Well, we even now overcome through the
   blood of the Lamb! Peace with God--that is Heaven! And at this moment,
   "Being justified by faith we have peace with God." Holiness--that is
   Heaven! Yes, but we are made holy, now, by the work of the Spirit of
   God in our hearts. Communion with God--that is Heaven! But even today,
   "Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus
   Christ."

   Is it not good, sometimes, to sit down and anticipate the day when you
   will come into your inheritance? You have heard of the young prince,
   who, when his father wakened one morning, was found putting on the
   king's crown. It was awkward in his case, but your Father will not
   object to your often putting on your crown! Try it and see how it fits.
   You will have a new song to sing--begin to sing it here! You will have
   holy work to do--"They serve God day and night in His Temple"--serve
   Him here! Christ is to dwell among us in Heaven--let us know that He
   dwells among us here! I like that verse of our hymn--

   "I would begin the music here, And so my soul should rise! Oh, for some
   heavenly notes to bear My passions to the skies!"

   It was said of an old Puritan that Heaven was in him before he was in
   Heaven. That is necessary for all of us--we must have Heaven in us
   before we got to Heaven. If we do not get to Heaven before we die, we
   shall never get there afterwards. An old Scotchman was asked whether he
   ever expected to get to Heaven. "Why, Man, I live there," was his
   quaint reply. Let us all live in those spiritual things which are the
   essential features of Heaven! Often go there before you go to stay
   there! If you come down tomorrow morning, knowing and realizing that
   Heaven is yours, and that you will soon be there, those children will
   not worry you half so much! When you go out to your business or to your
   work, you will not be half so discontent when you know that this is not
   your rest, but that you have a rest on the eternal hills where your
   heart has already gone--and that there your portion is in the
   everlasting dwellings! "Lay hold on eternal life." Get a hold of it
   now! It is a thing of the future and it is a thing of the present--and
   even your part of it that is future can be, by faith, so realized and
   grasped as to be actually enjoyed while you are yet here. "Lay hold on
   eternal life."

   I have not explained my text so fully or so clearly as I could wish.
   The life of which it speaks is beyond all language, but if you will
   obey the exhortation of the text, that will be the best exposition of
   it. Let him that has not this eternal life believe that it is to be
   had. Let the man whose heart aches for it, grasp it and appropriate it
   now--he need not be afraid that he will be repelled! Let him that has
   it, hold it fast as a jewel for which, sooner than part with it, he
   would sell house and home! Let him that has it, enjoy it even now. God
   help you in this manner to "lay hold on eternal life"!

   III. Now I have to finish with just a special word. WHO ARE THE PEOPLE
   THAT OUGHT CHIEFLY TO LAY

   HOLD ON ETERNAL LIFE?

   First, those who are called. This is the reason the Apostle gives to
   Timothy--"whereunto you are also called." Beloved, there are some of
   you that have been called. A boy, who had come upon an errand, stood at
   my window this afternoon. Suddenly he ran away and I thought, "What
   made him go?" I found out that though I had not heard the voice,
   someone had called him and, therefore, he was gone. Imitate that boy!
   Go about this world as men who have been called by a voice that nobody
   has heard but you! Has God called you to Himself? He means you to come
   away from your old self and cease to live the old life--He would have
   you lay hold on eternal life! God never singles us out in this way
   unless He means to bless us! He never says, "Seek you My face," in
   vain! Has God called you out from among men? Do you feel what your
   parents and friends at home do not feel? Is there a call to you like
   that call, "Samuel, Samuel," and have you responded, "Here I am, for
   You did call me. Speak, for Your servant hears"? Oh, if God has favored
   you with a special and effectual call, then lay hold on eternal life
   with your whole heart and soul--and never let it go! Come what may,
   resolve that you will hold to this gift of God in life, in death and
   throughout eternity!

   Next, those who have confessed Christ ought especially to lay hold on
   eternal life--"whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good
   profession before many witnesses." Timothy had been baptized and
   probably there had been a great number of persons to encourage or watch
   him as he came forward to confess Christ. This, then, was a double
   reason why he should hold fast that on which he had laid hold. O you
   that have named the name of Christ and have put Him on by that
   wonderful symbol of death and burial and resurrection, "Lay hold on
   eternal life." Do not play at Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Let these
   be stern, no, sweet realities to you! Lay hold, not only on the symbol,
   but on what the symbol means! Have you been "Buried with Him by baptism
   into death"? Then grasp the soul of the symbol. It is not a mere empty
   form, or only the badge of a sect, but a picture of the end of the old
   life of the flesh dying to the world and sin, that we may rise in
   "newness of life" to walk before God in the land of the living! Of all
   men, he who has been baptized should "lay hold on eternal life," for,
   in proportion as his Baptism is true, he has no other life to lay hold
   of, having died and been buried with Christ!

   Then, also, we come to His Table and there we eat His flesh and drink
   His blood after a spiritual sort, receiving not merely bread and wine
   as memorials, but Himself, by faith, into our hearts! "Lay hold on
   eternal life," for profession without eternal life is a fearful
   mockery. Without eternal life, to come to the Lord's Supper will be to
   eat and drink condemnation to yourself, not discerning the Lord's body!
   You that have professed Him before many witnesses, "Lay hold on eternal
   life."

   And, especially do I say this to those who have been consecrated, like
   Timothy, to the service of the Christian ministry. You that have been
   permitted in any way, even in the Sunday school, to speak of Christ to
   children. You to whom the Lord has committed His Gospel, that you may
   impart it to others, "Lay hold on eternal life." You will never do much
   in this work unless you have eternal life within your own soul. See to
   that first. A dead preacher--what is he but a mocker of dead souls? A
   dead teacher--what can she teach? A dead instructor of a Bible
   class--how shall the Word of Life have free course and be glorified? A
   blind man teaching about colors, or a dumb man teaching music is not
   more out of place than a man without eternal life trying to tell out
   the Gospel! What can he do? "Lay hold on eternal life," or else quit
   this false position lest, when the Lord comes, He should say to you,
   "What have you to do to declare My statutes, or that you should take My
   Covenant in your mouth?" Ah, I am speaking to myself, now, and I will
   take it home. Will you also open your heart to whatever in the sermon
   belongs to you? And when it is done and my voice is silent to your
   ears, I pray that you may hear, for many a day, a gentle whisper saying
   to you, "Lay hold on eternal life."

   You, poor Sinner, as you go after your follies and amusements, may the
   call, "Lay hold on eternal life," come to you until you shall obey it
   and quit such trifles! And you, Christian, when you get into the world
   and are tempted to make gain by sin, while you will suffer loss by
   righteousness, may you hear a voice say, "Lay hold on eternal life"!
   And any of

   you who get the "cold shoulder" and the rough side of men's tongues,
   when you begin to think that you cannot bear it, may you hear the voice
   saying, again, "Lay hold on eternal life." Cling to that, for God, for
   Christ, for eternity, for Heaven! The eternal life is the only life
   worth living! God help you to live for it always and, if you do, it
   will be of His own Grace--and to Him shall be all the Glory, forever
   and ever! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--1 Timothy 6.

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 25, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   22, 1891.

   "And next to him was Amasiah the Son of Zichri, who willingly offered
   himself to the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of
   valor." 2 Chronicles 17:16.

   IT was a great thing for King Jehoshaphat to have such a pious
   lord-lieutenant, one who could command an army and, at the same time,
   obey the commands of God. Christian men ought greatly to value
   Christian servants, especially if such persons are employed in
   positions of trust. If we can have godly men to occupy our offices and
   transact our business, we should be very grateful and do our best to
   encourage and cheer them. It is true that sometimes those who make the
   loudest profession of religion are the least trustworthy, but that very
   fact shows that there is something in the religion they falsely
   profess, which, if really laid hold of, makes a man more upright and
   reliable. Otherwise why should it be counterfeited? The larger the
   responsibility, the more necessary it is to have men who can be
   depended upon to manage the business. It was for the great benefit of
   Jehoshaphat, as king, that he should have a godly captain over so large
   a part of his army as 200,000 mighty men of valor.

   It was also a great thing for the country of Judah to have a godly man
   in such a position. "When the righteous are in authority, the people
   rejoice: but when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn." I hope that
   in England there will be an increasing desire that those persons who
   represent us in Parliament, or who legislate in any way, should be men
   of good character. The day will yet come when it will be judged that
   those who are immoral are not the men to make our laws or to see that
   those laws are carried out. It is, however, a great blessing to a
   country to have godly men in high places who will see to it that right
   is done, that justice is maintained and that the ends of true religion
   are promoted. Happy is the nation that has godly officers to discharge
   its business--men who fear God and fear no one else!

   I wonder how this man, Amasiah, the son of Zichri, came to be a servant
   of God? We have no history of his experience. We could almost wish that
   we had, but since it is not recorded, it makes us feel that although
   men and women cannot tell us the way in which they were led to yield to
   Christ, yet if their lives show that they are serving God, we must be
   well content. If you are saved, even though you cannot tell us when or
   how the great change was worked, we will rejoice in the fact of your
   salvation! Amasiah is a man of whom we do not know anything beyond
   this--he "willingly offered himself unto the Lord." There must have
   been a turning point in his career--a time when first he knew the Grace
   of God which worked such a change in him. There must have been a waking
   up to the feeling that God deserved his love and his life. There must
   have been a time of quickening into spiritual consecration. We are told
   nothing about that--therefore we must leave it under the veil which
   Scripture draws over his history. But if I say little about his
   exercises of soul and press onward to a very practical point, I
   earnestly desire that the inward enlightenment that he enjoyed may be
   known by many of you--and that God, the Holy Spirit, may work upon your
   hearts and bring you out of the bondage and servitude of sin into the
   glorious liberty of the Gospel which will make you capable of willingly
   offering yourselves to the

   Lord!

   I am here as a recruiting sergeant. I have no ribbons with me, nor
   shillings, but I cast a longing eye on many here present who, as yet,
   do not belong to my Master! And I fervently hope that they may be
   enlisted in His service. Often have I seen the recruiting sergeant
   lingering about certain streets and looking at every young man passing
   by. I have known him address some young gentleman who was amazed that
   he should ever have been spoken to him about such a thing-- and who, in
   his offended dignity, felt a deal more inclined to kick the sergeant
   than to give him a civil answer! And the officer has said to him, "I
   beg your pardon, Sir, but I thought such a smart looking fellow as you
   would be just the kind of man to take the Queen's shilling," and,
   soothed by the compliment, the gentleman has gone on his way laughing.
   He wanted no Queen's shilling and was not at all inclined for army
   service!

   I would desire to be as bold in addressing you as the sergeant is in
   his calling. And if I should intrude upon some young gentleman who
   should feel angry because of my importunity, I shall not at all object.
   I shall say, "Very well, but you must excuse my feeling that the more
   ability and influence you have, the greater is the reason why you
   should be converted to Christ that you might serve my Master." God
   knows how I rejoice over the poorest, the most ignorant, the most
   depraved of men or women when they are brought to Christ! But I do
   like, sometimes, to see those come to Him who have some life in them,
   some talent about them and who can, by consecrating themselves to the
   Lord, do for His cause and Kingdom, by His Grace, a real service in
   days to come! There is hard fighting to be done and my Lord calls for
   men who will not be afraid to do it! Let all the heroism of your
   manhood impel you to this blessed service. You are not asked to serve
   the Lord because He promises you ease and pleasure--you are, rather,
   called to "endure hardness" as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. As we
   sang just now--

   "You that are men, now serve Him Against unnumbered foes! Your courage
   rise with danger, And strength to strength oppose." I am going to use
   the account of this Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who willingly offered
   himself to the Lord, as an illustration of what, I trust, will be true
   about many of my hearers. Oh, that the Holy Spirit may draw out
   somebody who shall become a very Apostle in these times! A
   standard-bearer for the Lord Jesus, who shall--

   "Lift high His royal banner,"

   among the sons of men!

   I. First, let me say that Amasiah is distinguished from the other
   mighty men of King Jehoshaphat by the fact that HE MADE IT HIS LIFEWORK
   TO SERVE THE LORD. He "willingly offered himself to the Lord," and he
   was accepted and became a life-long servant of Jehovah, the God of
   Israel!

   It should not need much talk to make men feel that this is reasonable
   service. To serve your Maker, who created you that you should glorify
   Him, is surely a natural thing to do. And it becomes a thing to be more
   expected when you are asked to serve your Redeemer who shed His blood
   that you might be set free from sin and, "yield your members servants
   unto holiness." Would it not be a right thing for you to offer yourself
   to Him who yielded Himself to the death for us?--

   "Offered was He, for greatest and the least; Himself the Victim, and
   Himself the Priest." This is an argument Amasiah had not, yet did he
   find reason enough to serve the Lord. How much stronger is the claim
   upon you! And if this plea needs to be strengthened still farther,
   think that you are called to serve Him with whom you hope to dwell
   forever in Heaven. It ought to be an instinct of every reasonable soul
   to set about such service instantly! Ordinary gratitude should cause
   every Christian to say to his Lord, "Whom else should I serve? I owe
   You my very being, my new life and all I possess. In You I live. By You
   I am daily fed. Why should I not serve You?"--

   "Yours am I by all ties, But chiefly Yours That through Your sacrifice
   You, Lord, are mine.

   By Your own cords of love, so sweetly wound Around me, I to You am
   closely bound."

   Moreover, this is honorable service. Men like a service that seems to
   reflect some kind of glory upon them. To serve a great man makes even
   the footman feel as if he were, himself, a great man, too--at least I
   have seen some of these gentlemen give themselves mighty airs under the
   notion that they were as grand as their master! But to serve God really
   gives honor and glory! O Sirs, if this is not done in mere pretense,
   but in reality, what a grand life a man must lead who is the servant of
   God! To serve Him whom angels serve, whom archangels serve--whose
   service is perfect freedom--is the most honorable service to which a
   man can attain! There is nothing humiliating or debasing about it, but
   everything that tends to lift us upward and to make us grow in
   spiritual force. To serve God is to reign! Every man becomes a king in
   proportion as he really serves the Lord!

   Further, this is remunerative service, the most remunerative in all the
   world! The devil spoke a Truth of God that he did not mean to speak
   when he said, "Does Job serve God for nothing?" God never lets His
   servants serve Him for nothing! He may not always give them gold or
   worldly prosperity, but He will give them a reward more satisfying to
   them than these things--more grateful to their hearts than all the
   treasures of the Indies! I never met with a man that served God who
   complained of his wages. No, it is so much a work of Grace that the
   work, itself, is a gift to us. The privilege of

   serving God--yes, call it the high honor, the delight, the great gain
   of being a servant of God--if there were no other reward, this would
   suffice us! I can sympathize with him who said--

   "Dismiss me not Your service, Lord, But train me for Your will, For
   even I, in fields so broad, Some duties may fulfill. And I will ask for
   no reward Except to serve You still."

   But the fact is that, in serving the Lord, we have, through Grace,
   "peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." We realize that the
   love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is
   given to us. "We know that all things work together for good" to us
   while we are here and that the best part of our religion is yet to
   come, for--

   "After death its joys shall be Lasting as eternity."

   He whose life is devoted to the service of God must have a blessed
   life! It is not always a happy life in the judgment of men, yet is it
   still happy in the judgment of God--and in the estimation of the
   Believer, himself! The servants of God have a happy service.

   I may also say that this is safe service. God will not put you into a
   position of danger when you enter His service. If you serve men, they
   may tempt you to do wrong. Many a young man who has entered an office
   or a shop has found himself commanded to do what no honest man ought to
   expect another to do. Many a young woman has taken her position in a
   family where temptation has been like Nebuchadnezzar's furnace to her.
   But if you serve God, He may try you, but He will never tempt you to
   sin. In following hard after Him, you will be in safe places, and the
   more you are obedient to the will of God, the more secure will you be
   from temptations within and without. Obedience will keep you from
   peril. The Grace of God will preserve you from all evil.

   After all, I am not like that recruiting sergeant, who, if he tries to
   get a man to serve under the colors, has to put it very prettily. He
   tells about the merry times that soldiers have, but he does not say
   much about wounds and wooden legs. He does not talk much about bleeding
   to death on the battlefield, nor about being discharged, at last, with
   nothing a week to live upon after your best days have been given in
   your country's service. No, he always picks out the bright colors and
   praises "Her Majesty's Service" as if it were all pipe clay and red
   coats and fine feathers and glory and I know not what besides!

   Now, I have not to do that. There is no fault in my Master's service
   that I need to conceal from you! All round it is the best, the
   happiest, the most glorious position that a man can occupy! And though
   I would bid you count the cost before you enroll yourself under His
   leadership, you may rest assured that you can never calculate the value
   of the reward that Christ has in store for all His faithful followers!
   Therefore, without any reserve, I may fairly come to each man here and
   say, "Like Amasiah, the son of Zichri, offer yourself willingly to the
   Lord."

   II. Now, to go a step further, notice, in the second place, concerning
   this man Amasiah, HE WAS A READY VOLUNTEER "who willingly offered
   himself to the Lord." There is much truth in the old proverb that "one
   volunteer is worth 20 pressed men." Service willingly rendered has a
   fragrance and a bloom about it that make it most delightful and
   acceptable!

   He needed no pressing. Some of you need so much persuading that you are
   hardly worth having when, at last, we get you. There is such a thing as
   pressing a man so long that all the juice is gone out of him and you
   have only the husk of the man when you do manage to get him. Amasiah
   needed no pressing at all, for in his soul there was an ardent desire
   to serve the living God--he "willingly offered himself to the Lord."

   He needed no hunting out. How many, even of Church members, seem to be
   like Saul when he was elected king and they could not find him! "Where
   is that tall fellow, head and shoulders above the rest of the people?"
   At last somebody said that he had hidden himself among the stuff! Many
   of our young men, today, are among the stuff--and there are numbers
   both of men and women who ought to be coming forward for the Lord's
   service instead of hiding among the rubbish! My dear friend, Mr.
   Pearce, the superintendent of our Sunday school, says that he needs
   more teachers. There are plenty who might engage in the work, but they
   are among the stuff! Let them imitate Amasiah, "who willingly offered
   himself to the Lord."

   Amasiah was a self-contained man. He needed no looking after when he
   had once come out. We have some Christians who will stay right as long
   as somebody else looks after them. How many such there are in all
   Churches! You must always

   be watching them or else they will be up to mischief, or growing cold,
   ceasing to attend the means of Grace, getting into evil company and
   going back to the world! Amasiah was not of that kind. He "offered
   himself willingly to the Lord" and, having done so, he stood to his
   consecration vow.

   He needed no leader. On the contrary, he took the lead, himself, over
   200,000 men! We have many that will follow pretty well. We need some
   that will not need leading except by our great Leader, the Lord
   Jesus--men who know what they know, believe what they believe, know how
   they ought to act and are resolved so to act--and will do it even to
   the end. It was a fine motto which a distinguished worker once
   adopted--"Resolved, that I will act as if there were no one else to
   act, not waiting for others." This is the spirit which we long to see
   among the Lord's people--not a spirit of lawlessness and disorder--but
   of loyalty and independence! A spirit which will not timidly wait until
   everybody is ready, but, knowing the will of God, will at all hazards
   go forward to do it!

   Amasiah, the leader of this host of "mighty men of valor," would be
   certain to be a man, himself, of valor! Like leader--like followers. He
   that would lead brave men must, himself, be brave! We need in this
   generation more men, who, in Christ's service, shall perform deeds of
   daring as British soldiers do to win the Victoria Cross which has
   inscribed upon it the words, "For valor." Christ has right royal
   rewards for those who faithfully serve Him. I should like to meet with
   a band of brave young men, ready to render valiant service to my Lord,
   young men with backbones--there have not been many of that kind made
   lately--they are, today, generally soft down the back. Most men I meet
   are very squeezable, men of India rubber that yields every way!

   But we need for Christ and for His cause, some who cannot be turned
   aside to offer themselves willingly to the Lord, doing it decidedly, at
   once, and from the bottom of their hearts! God grant, by His Spirit,
   that some such may, by this sermon, be led to the knowledge and service
   of the Lord!

   III. The third point about Amasiah is that, while he was a volunteer,
   HE OFFERED HIMSELF TO THE LORD.

   "Himself"--it was the best thing he had! Some of you, perhaps, have not
   anything else to offer. Then, do as he did-- willingly offer yourself!
   I have heard of a little boy at a public meeting where there was a
   missionary collection. When the collector came to him, he asked him to
   hold the plate a little lower. Thinking he wanted to see his money drop
   on the plate and, being a kindly man, he held the plate down low.
   "Please, Sir, it is not low enough. Would you mind putting it on the
   floor?" The collector good-humoredly put it down and then the boy said,
   "I have not even a penny to give to the collection, so I want to get
   into the plate and give myself to God." It was a simple thing to do,
   but that is exactly what we desire that many may do at this good hour.
   Willingly offer yourselves, like Amasiah, to the Lord!

   He made no reserve as to what he had. He gave himself, his money, his
   ability, his position, his influence. All was yielded up to the Lord.
   "Well," says one, "I give so much to the weekly offering." Do you? I am
   glad to hear it, but have you given yourself? "I sometimes go out and
   sing a sacred song at a meeting," you say. That is quite right--you
   give your voice--but have you given yourself? "I have joined the
   Church," another says. That, too, is a very proper thing to do if you
   are really a Believer. But it is not all, nor is it the first
   thing--you have given us the distinguished privilege of having your
   name written on our Church Roll--but have you given yourself to the
   Lord? It is said of Amasiah, that he "willingly offered himself to the
   Lord."

   You have often found, I doubt not, a chrysalis. You have perhaps said,
   as you stooped to pick it up, "I will take that home and see what kind
   of butterfly comes out of it." You have kept it and kept it and nothing
   has ever come out of it because the butterfly had already flown away.
   Many people about us are like that. We hope that they are going to do
   something, but nothing ever comes out of our chrysalis! There is
   nothing living inside and, therefore, there is never any flutter of
   life, nor flight of wings. But when a man gives himself willingly to
   the Lord, making no reserve as to what he has, then we have something
   worth the having! I like to sing--

   "Yet if I might make some reserve,

   And duty did not call,

   I love my Lord with zeal so great

   That I should give Him all."

   Notice yet another thing about Amasiah, which, I think, must have been
   true--he made no reserve as to what he did. He gave himself to the
   Lord, as much as to say, "Lord, put me here and I will stay here. Put
   me there and I will stay there. Make me a great man and I will serve
   You. Make me a little man and I will serve You. Give me health and
   strength, and I will serve You. But if You choose, rather, to send me
   sickness and lay me on a bed of languishing, still I will serve You."
   In some such way I can fancy that Amasiah gave himself up to the
   service of the King of Kings! This is how we should come willingly to
   Christ--when He says, "Go"--to go! When He says, "Come"--to come! When
   He says, "Do

   this"--to do it! We must be willing to do His will as the little girl
   said the angels do--"without asking any questions"--and thus numbering
   ourselves among the company who stand ready to obey their Master's
   least word--

   "Theirs not to reason why,

   Theirs not to make reply,

   Theirs but to do or die."

   Christ must be the absolute Master of the saved soul--and the soul that
   is truly saved is willing either to go or stay as may seem best to his
   Lord. For it is to the Lord that he has given himself--to One who
   henceforth is to rule and reign over his whole life! I trust that some
   to whom these words come will thus offer themselves, making no reserve
   as to what they shall do, and--

   "Where duty calls or danger, Be always wanting there."

   When Amasiah willingly offered himself for the Lord's service, he made
   no reserve as to when it should be. He probably gave himself to the
   Lord while he was a young man. He began with all his heart to serve God
   in his youth. And when he was in middle life and his children were
   round about him, he was still unfalteringly the servant of God. When he
   grew gray and others ventured to think that he had better retire from
   active service, he might think it wise to give up some of his work, but
   never would he retire from the service of his God, for he had willingly
   offered himself to the Lord! He made no reserve about serving up to a
   certain time and then stopping--but he would serve his God while he had
   breath in his body!

   And he made no reserve as to how that service should be rendered. As I
   have already said, he would serve in health, but he would serve Him in
   sickness, too. Yes, and he would serve God by doing nothing at all, if
   such was His will. One of the hardest works for saints to do is to do
   nothing. When they get so infirm that they cannot leave their room, or
   even their bed--perhaps their very voice fails them so that they cannot
   speak--then what difficult work it is to say with the heart, "Lord, I
   served You when I labored for You, and I will serve You when I cannot
   labor for You. I trusted You when I could speak about You and I will
   trust You now that I cannot speak about You. I am Your servant. If my
   Lord bids me do anything, I will do it. If He gives me no command, yet
   I will still be His servant. In life and in death my ear shall be bored
   to my Master's doorpost!" In this fashion, I suppose, Amasiah willingly
   offered himself to the Lord. Have you not sometimes seen the telegraph
   boys, standing or sitting still at the Post Office when there is no
   message to be delivered? They are as much doing their work by waiting
   as when they carry to its destination the dispatch which has been
   flashed along the wires! In waiting they serve and, in like manner,
   they most truly serve the Lord who give up all idea of self-pleasing
   and, go or stay, as best pleases Him, to whom they willingly offer
   themselves to be His servants.

   I have been explaining what kind of volunteers I want to enlist for my
   Lord. I wonder whether the Holy Spirit is saying to some young man,
   "You are the man. You are the man. You should willingly offer yourself
   to the Lord," or whether he is gently suggesting to some dear Sister,
   "You are the beloved of the Lord and may serve Him like Deborah or
   Dorcas if you will but give yourself now." You remember how Zinzendorf
   was converted to Christ by seeing, at Diis-seldorf, Stenburg's picture
   of Christ on the Cross, and at the bottom these words--

   "All this I did for thee.

   What have you done for Me?"

   I pass on the question to you, though I cannot paint the picture or
   make you see the vision. If Christ has redeemed you, why, it follows,
   as a matter of course, that you will reckon that you are not your own,
   for you are bought with a price and, like Amasiah, you will willingly
   offer yourself to God! As you survey the wondrous Cross on which He
   died, you will surely be constrained to say with Dr. Watts--

   "Were the whole realm of Nature mine, That were a present far too
   small. Love so amazing, so Divine, Demands my soul, my life, my all."
   IV. Now, I have a fourth observation to make which is important, though
   it may not seem so. When Amasiah willingly offered himself to the Lord,
   HE DID THIS IN A SECULAR CALLING.

   He did not stipulate to be a Prophet. I do not know how it is, but when
   a certain type of young man gets it into his head that he will serve
   God, the next thing is that he wants to see me about how he can get
   into the ministry. Perhaps I look at him and I see that his mouth was
   never made for preaching. You can see by the appearance of his eyes
   that they were never made to look a congregation in the face. When he
   begins to talk, you can tell that he might possibly make a

   good student for the next 20 years and then, perhaps, he would be able
   to teach a class of boys--but the boys would soon be tired of him, for
   they would probably find out, even then, that they knew as much as he
   did.

   Some have no gift for instructing others, but that need not hinder them
   from serving Christ as they can. Remember, Amasiah did not say, "Lord,
   I will give myself to You if You will let me be a Prophet." No! He
   willingly offered himself to the Lord to be what the Lord would have
   him to be-- and so he remained a soldier. He was in the army and never
   went to any college and never preached a sermon in his life--but he
   "willingly offered himself to the Lord." You may willingly offer
   yourself to the Lord and go and keep a shop, selling articles
   unadulterated--sixteen ounces to the pound and 12 to the dozen--unless
   you make it thirteen! You may willingly offer yourself to the Lord and
   be a shoemaker--there have been consecrated cobblers before now, as
   both Sunday schools and foreign missions can testify! You may willingly
   offer yourself to the Lord, even though your daily calling is that of a
   chimney-sweep--that is a very necessary business and though your face
   may become blackened in it--your heart may be clean all the time!

   You may willingly offer yourself to the Lord and be breaking stones on
   the roads, praying your Master, all the while, to break stony hearts.
   There is no lawful occupation in which a man cannot thoroughly serve
   the Lord! It is a great privilege and blessing to be set apart to the
   work of winning souls, but we must never separate that work from all
   the rest of the callings of life as though it, alone, were sacred, and
   all the rest were secular and almost sinful! Serve God where you are!
   Good Woman, go on looking after those dear children now that your
   husband has been called Home-- you will be serving God by bringing up
   those boys and girls in the knowledge of Christ--God help you to do it!
   Go on, dear Daughter, helping Mother. You need not aspire to be shaking
   a kingdom--shake the bed, well, tomorrow morning! There are many
   persons who have some very exalted ideas in their heads about who will
   serve God best by just doing commonplace work in a commonplace way--and
   will probably never be permitted to do anything else--at least that
   will be the case until they step down from their stilts and get rid of
   their lofty notions.

   Yet it cannot have been very easy for Amasiah to live wholly to God as
   a soldier. His was a difficult calling, though, I suppose, in his days
   it was not so difficult as it is now. But he did it, whether his
   occupation was difficult or not. Wherever your lot is cast, abide in
   your calling and glorify God in it, as this man did! "For he that is
   called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise
   also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant." Even if your
   lot is cast in the barracks, be bold to confess your Master! Many a man
   has become a soldier of Christ by seeing his comrade in the regiment
   kneel down and pray. With the memory of many a hero, both in the army
   and out of it, we may be certain that however difficult the place, the
   Grace of God is sufficient for us as it was for Amasiah.

   Not only did he serve the Lord in this hard place, but he rose to
   eminence in it. I do not know how he began. When I saw him last--that
   is, when I last looked at my text--he was the commander of 200,000
   mighty men of valor! A fine position that! He had become one of the
   five great generals of Jehoshaphat's army. Where he began, I cannot
   tell, but it is quite certain that, in fearing God, he was not hindered
   in his promotion. The man who fears God need not be hindered one whit
   in rising in the world! That is to say, if it is worthwhile rising in
   the world, for there are some kinds of elevation so disgraceful that
   they are better shunned than sought! It is, in many cases, a great
   thing for a man to be kept down. A good doctor of divinity, whom I well
   knew, met a Christian man in the street, shook hands with him and
   congratulated him. The man said, "I do not know, Dr. Jeter, why you
   congratulate me, for I have had a world of trouble. In fact, I have
   failed in my business." To which the good doctor replied, "I
   congratulate you because you failed honestly--you are the only man that
   I have seen for years who has done that." Then he shook hands with him
   again and said, "My dear fellow, I do thank God that you failed
   honestly." But no man need fail because he serves God. No man need
   stick in the mud forever because he becomes a Christian, for,
   "godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life
   that now is and of that which is to come."

   Yet another thing we may venture to say of Amasiah. He left an
   honorable record. Here is a man in Jehoshaphat's army who willingly
   offers himself to the Lord and rises to be commander of 200,000 mighty
   men of valor. It reminds me of Havelock and his saints in the Indian
   Mutiny. There was a stern fight to be fought and the general said,
   "Send for Havelock and his saints"--and they soon accomplished the
   task! When you get men who thoroughly serve God in whatever position of
   life they are, they are terrible fellows! They will do the thing where
   others only talk about it, for God does help, even in the ordinary
   concerns of daily life, those that put their trust in Him. They shall
   never be confounded. "The angels of the Lord encamps round about them
   that fear Him, and delivers them." They can say, "By You I have run
   through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall." Moreover, "The
   memory of the just is blessed"--the footprints they leave behind them
   help others on in the blessed way. And when they fall asleep, they are
   among the blessed dead who "rest from their labors"--they could not do
   that if here they had been idle--"and their works do follow them."

   I am still working away, you see, at my main point. I am wanting to get
   that fine young fellow into my Lord's army! I am praying God the Holy
   Spirit to influence men and women to say, "We will willingly offer
   ourselves to the Lord. We will serve Him with our whole heart and
   soul." God grant that it may be so!

   V. I have done when I add these words--Amasiah not only served the
   Lord, but HE IS AN EXAMPLE TO OTHERS. Let us make the best application
   of the sermon by working it out in our own lives.

   First of all, he is an example to the young. He was probably a young
   man when he "willingly offered himself to the Lord." Why wait to grow
   older in sin before entering the glorious service of Christ? The world
   has nothing that can satisfy your heart--turn from its folly and choose
   the nobler path! If you are only a child, still I appeal to you--the
   earlier you offer yourself to the Lord, the better will it be for all
   the future of your life!

   Amasiah is an example, also, to men of position. He held a high office,
   but he "willingly offered himself to the Lord." Young man of fortune
   and rank, I have a message from the Lord for you! Offer yourself
   willingly to the Lord. As you would be saved by the precious blood of
   Christ and the Free Grace of God, come and lay yourself down at those
   dear feet that bled for your salvation--you know not what work the Lord
   has yet for you to do!

   He is also an example to men who are rising in the world, for he was
   such. I speak to some of you who have not risen, yet, but are rising.
   You are doing well, as the world has it. God is prospering you. I would
   lay my hand upon your shoulder, young man, and say, "Since God is
   blessing you so, willingly offer yourself for His service. You know
   that you are not saved by the offering of yourself to Christ--you are
   saved by Christ offering Himself for you--a Sacrifice for sin. But if
   He has saved you, then come and offer yourself to the Lord! The
   children do not now cry for bread to you, as they used to do. No, thank
   God, those sad days are over with for you! The wife has not to wear
   rags, as once she did. God has been gracious to you and helped you on
   in the world and now, by the gratitude that you have for Him, ask
   yourself whether you cannot serve Him and may He, by His sweet love,
   bring you to do so!" My Lord ought to have you. Shall He not have you?

   I recollect how Mr. Rowland Hill once held an auction over Lady Anne
   Erskine, who drove up in her carriage to the edge of the crowd while
   Mr. Hill was preaching. He said "Ah, I see Lady Anne Erskine." A
   careless, thoughtless woman she was, then, and he said, "There is a
   great contention about who shall have her! The world wants to have her.
   What will you give for her, O World? 'I will give her fame and name and
   pleasure!' And sin wants to have her. What will you give for her, O
   Sin? 'A few paltry transient joys.' And Satan wants to have her. What
   will you give for her, Satan? 'And the price was very low.' At last
   Christ came along and He said, 'I give Myself for her. I give My life
   for her, My blood for her.'" And turning to Her Ladyship, Mr. Hill
   said, "You shall have her, my Lord Christ, if she does not object--My
   Lady, which shall it be?" he asked. And she bowed her head and said
   that she accepted Christ's offer and would be sold to Him, and be His
   forever.

   I do not know how to pick anybody out, here, for auction, but I would
   sell some of you to my Master if I could, without money and without
   price, save that which He paid for you when He poured out His life on
   the accursed tree! Where are the volunteers? Perhaps it is some bright
   boy that I have to get for Christ; or some dear girl whom the Lord
   means to have now; or some of these young men. Never did anyone truly
   offer himself to the Lord without being accepted--no, your offer of
   yourself to the Lord proves that you are already His in the Covenant of
   His Grace! Oh, how happy are they who, in their youth, willingly offer
   themselves to God! But, indeed, my Lord will take into His service
   people of all ages, both sexes, all ranks and conditions! He cares not
   what your possessions may be, but, whatever they are, offer yourself
   and them to Him to whom they rightfully belong! He will take the
   poorest and weakest, but still, I would like to win for my Master some
   man in the very strength of his days, with ability to think and power
   to speak, who will now say, "I have found my vocation. God calls me to
   Christ to find salvation in His wounds and to be His servant. It shall
   be all my business here below to magnify His blessed name!" God grant
   it, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   PORTIONS OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--2 Chronicles 17; Romans 12.

The Law's Failure and Fulfillment

   (No. 2228)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   1, 1891.

   "For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
   God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin,
   condemned in the flesh. That the righteousness of the Law might be
   fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
   Romans 8:3,4.

   THE Law of God is perfect. You cannot add anything to it, nor take
   anything from it, without spoiling it. If you will read the Ten
   Commandments and understand them in their spiritual meaning, you will
   find that they are far-reaching and that they deal with every sin. I
   noticed, some time ago, that a learned prelate said that he could not
   find any Commandment against gambling. Where were his eyes? Is it not
   plainly written, "You shall not covet"? What is gambling but
   covetousness in action? Most manifestly, the gambler desires his
   neighbor's goods and this desire gives zest to the vice which the Law
   of God quite plainly condemns. Depend upon it, there is nothing wrong
   but the Law of God condemns it and there is nothing right but the Law
   approves it. The Decalogue is an absolutely perfect Law.

   If you take the soul of it, what I may call the summary of the Law, it
   seems to me to be even larger in brief than it is in the lengthy form.
   Here it is. First, in the Old Testament in two different passages, one
   in the Sixth Chapter of Deuteronomy and the other in the Nineteenth of
   Leviticus, and then as given by Christ in answer to the question of a
   lawyer-- "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and
   with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind;
   and your neighbor as yourself." Wonderful Law, summed up in one word,
   "LOVE" but comprehending in its circle every form of duty which springs
   out of our relationship to God or man! Well may Paul say, as in the
   previous chapter, "Therefore the Law is holy and the Commandment holy,
   and just, and good." If evil is worked, it is not the Law of God which
   works it, for that Law is the expression of the Nature of the Eternal
   and reveals His holiness and justice-- but as "God is Love," the Law
   which He gives is also comprehended in the same word--love. "We know
   that the Law is good, if a man uses it lawfully."

   But there are some things which the Law cannot do. It cannot produce a
   new heart in a sinner. It cannot save a lost soul. It cannot justify a
   guilty person. It cannot draw a wanderer back to God. The Law, as
   originally given to Adam, a perfect man, had he carried it out, would
   have glorified God and would have produced in him a perfect life. But
   we are not in the same position towards God as Adam was and we are not
   free from the taint of evil as he was. We have fallen and there is now
   in our nature that which Paul calls, "the flesh," which lusts to envy,
   and turns aside from God. This has made the Law weak for the
   accomplishment of God's purpose of justification or salvation. The law
   of England, where it is true and good, protects honest men and deters
   many from committing crime--but it is practically powerless in the case
   of some habitual criminals who seem to have inherited the tendency to
   criminality. The defect is not in the law, but in the person with whom
   it has to deal. So the Law of God becomes weak through our weakness.
   There are some who cling to the Law and expect to be saved by their own
   doings, but they are leaning on a broken reed! To free from guilt and
   condemnation is what the Law cannot do, not on account of any fault in
   itself, but because it is weak through our flesh.

   What, then, is the purpose and limit of the Law? It sets before us a
   straight path. Right up the mountain side I see the way to the summit.
   But I have fallen into an abyss. I am bruised and broken--I cannot stir
   an inch. What is the use of a straight road to me? Here I must lie, at
   the bottom of the crevasse, and perish unless something more than a
   straight road is shown to me. The way is before me, but I am weak and
   cannot stir. The Law of God tells us what we ought to do, but that does
   not enable us to do it! Still, it is useful to know the way in which we
   should go, for that will show us how far we

   have fallen, cause us to be discontented with our present state and
   prepare us to accept help, if help should come. The Law can do that.

   The Law is also very useful because it shows us our deflections and
   stains. It is like the mirror which my lady holds up to her face that
   she may see if there are any spots on it. But she cannot wash her face
   with the mirror! When the mirror has done its utmost, there are the
   stains, all the same. It cannot take away a single spot--it can only
   show where it is. And the Law, though it reveals our sins, our
   shortcomings, our transgressions--it cannot remove the sin or the
   transgression. It is weak for that purpose because it was never
   intended to accomplish such an end.

   The Law also serves another purpose--it upbraids us for our sin. Did
   you ever feel its ten-thronged lash coming upon the back of your
   conscience? What furrows these plowers make! "Condemn him," says whole
   ten-throated Law of God! The First Commandment says, "Condemn him--he
   has broken me." And the Second Command says, "Condemn him-- he has
   broken me." And the Third says, "Condemn him--he has broken me." Not
   one of them is silent! All clamor for their due and if you truly know
   your own heart, you confess that not one charges you falsely, seeing
   that hate is murder and the thought of folly, sin! When conscience is
   really awake, what pain, what anguish the Law will bring to the spirit!
   But it cannot heal you. It cannot speak peace to you. It cannot forgive
   you. To convince and to condemn is all the Law can do. It is too weak
   to save even one poor sinner!

   Again, the Law can tell you what you ought to do, but it gives no
   inclination to do the right. On the contrary, without any blame to the
   Law, it often creates inclination to do otherwise. Paul says, "I was
   alive without the Law once: but when the Commandment came, sin revived,
   and I died." There are some things men would not think of doing if they
   were not forbidden--but the very forbidding of them makes some desire
   to do them! Many a thing which is commanded, we might have freely done
   if it had been left to our own choice--but such is the perversity of
   our nature that, being commanded to do it, straightway we refuse! We
   kick against the Commandments. The Law does not sweetly incline us to
   holiness, but, through the weakness, or, rather, wickedness of our
   flesh, it often stirs up the obstinate and rebellious propensities
   which are in our nature. Certainly the Law does not incline us to
   righteousness, but, "sin, taking occasion by the Commandment," works in
   us all manner of evil.

   The Law is weak in another way. It does not lend us any aid towards the
   fulfillment of its Commands. It says, "This do, and you shall live.
   Make the bricks; make the bricks," but it gives us no straw with which
   to make them, nor can we find any in all the land--so we are worse off
   than Israel in Egypt! The Law, in and of itself, does not contribute to
   our obedience to its commands, nor does it restrain us when we go
   astray. It thunders out, "You shall not kill," but when the heart darts
   its thought of bitterness, or the hand raises the assassin's knife, it
   does not hinder--it looks on, cold and unmoved. It aids us not in any
   way because it cannot! Only Divine Grace can do that. We have to look
   to another source for help in holiness.

   And when we have broken the Law of God, it brings no remedy. Of mercy
   the Law knows nothing. You have broken the Law--there is the penalty
   and you must bear it. Through having committed sin, you have brought
   upon yourself a grievous malady. The Law points out the malady, but it
   never brings any medicine with which to cure it! It pours in no oil and
   wine--it is no good Samaritan. It is not the Law's business to do that.
   When Her Majesty's judge is on the bench, his business there is to
   administer the law and to see that the rules of the nation are carried
   out fairly and justly. He does not sit there to provide for the poor or
   to help the sick, but to judge men and condemn the guilty! This is all
   that the Law of God was meant to do. In that it is weak through our
   flesh, there are some things which the Law cannot do.

   On one occasion some workmen were quarrying some rocks and, having made
   all ready for a blast--drilled the holes, filled them with gun-cotton
   and connected the fuses--they then warned everyone away from the place
   of danger. Then the fuses were lighted and the workmen, themselves,
   withdrew. But, to their horror, they saw a little boy, attracted by the
   lights, running towards them! Those strong men raised their voices and
   shouted to the boy, "Go back! Go back!"--they could do no more. But of
   course the boy, having the same nature as the rest of us, only went the
   more quickly forward and into the danger. Still the men cried, "Go
   back! Go back!" They were like the Law, powerless. Not because their
   voices were weak, but because of the material with which they had to
   deal.

   But the mother of the boy heard the call and, seeing the fearful peril
   in which her child was placed, she dropped on one knee, opened her arms
   wide and called, "Come to mother! Come to mother!" The boy stopped,
   turned, hesitated a moment, and then ran to her embrace and, in
   listening to her call and obeying it, escaped the danger which
   threatened

   him. What all the shouts of the strong men could not do, the gentle
   voice of the mother accomplished. Their voices were like the Law which
   says, "Go back! Go back!" Her voice was like the sweet sound of the
   Gospel, "Come to Jesus! Come to Jesus!" "For what the Law could not do,
   in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son" easily
   accomplished. Behold here the wisdom and might and love of Jehovah!

   Is it not a grand thing when a wise person, seeing a difficulty which
   he did not produce, comes in and sets everything right? Through our
   sinful flesh, there has come a great warp in the original order of
   things! God cannot be glorified by the Law, for we have broken it! And
   we cannot be saved by the Law, for we still continue to break it! But
   God, Himself, comes to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. I
   want to show you, first, God's glorious method. And when I have shown
   you that, I will speak of God's glorious accomplishment. These two
   things will serve us both for instruction and stimulus.

   I. First, GOD'S GLORIOUS METHOD. Here we are with a Law which we have
   not kept, any one of us--a Law which we never shall keep! There is no
   hope of salvation by the Law of God. What happens, then? Does He devise
   means that His banished be not expelled from Him forever? If He does,
   what are those means?

   Hear these words, "For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak
   through the flesh, God sending"--listen!-- "God sending," not God
   waiting till we went to Him, but, seeing our misery and helplessness,
   He sends. From yonder Throne, beyond your sight, and higher than your
   loftiest imagination, He sends! His thoughts are with poor, struggling,
   guilty, unworthy men--He sees that the Law cannot help men and that
   they will never glorify God by the Law, except it be by being made to
   suffer the punishment due for their sin. Therefore Jehovah interposes!
   God sends! I say again, He does not wait for us to come to Him. If we
   had sent an embassy to Him and waited at Heaven's gate many long years
   and He had, at last, deigned to answer us, it would have been a
   wonderful instance of love. But now He sends an Ambassador! It is He
   who has been offended who seeks to make peace--not the guilty and the
   offending ones!

   Read on farther. "God sending"--an angel? An archangel? No! "God
   sending His own Son." Hear this! He sends His Son. The case was so
   desperate that only God, Himself, could meet it! Well, Jesus Christ,
   God's own Son, is very God of very God--and He can do it. But shall He
   leave Heaven? Shall He come down to earth? Will He be a Servant? Will
   He who can command be humble, Himself, as to be sent? Will He, before
   whom angels bow with veiled faces, go on an errand down to earth? It is
   even so--"God sending His own Son." He had but one, His
   Only-Begotten--but He determined to have many and so He sent His one
   Son that He might, in "bringing many sons unto Glory," show to all
   worlds the riches of His love and Grace! From all eternity the Son was
   in the bosom of the Father--and no less than He shall be chosen to be
   an Ambassador of peace to the sons of men--

   "Hark, the glad sound, the Savior comes, The Sa vior promised long! Let
   every heart prepare a throne, And every voice a song."

   But how does He send Him? He sends Him in the flesh. This is the
   amazement of angels, the astonishment of all thoughtful beings! God
   sends His Son to take our flesh into communion with Himself! Not to be
   an angel--"for verily He took not on Him the nature of angels"--but to
   be a man and to come here, as you and I came here, by birth! In
   Bethlehem's manger He lies, the offspring of a woman! At that woman's
   breast He hangs, a Babe. Yes, He that made the heavens and the earth,
   "being in the form of God, counted it not a thing to be grasped," as
   the Revised Version gives it to us, "to be on an equality with God."
   Yet--oh, the amazing condescension--He has "emptied Himself, taking the
   form of a Servant, being made in the likeness of men." He has veiled
   Himself under the form of an Infant and there He is, bone of our bone,
   and flesh of our flesh! "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
   (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the
   Father), full of Grace and truth." The Incarnation of Christ is a great
   reality which we can never understand, but which we devoutly believe
   and, believing it, we have before us God's way of doing what the Law
   could not do. He sent His own Son in human flesh!

   But Paul puts it in a way which increases the wonder. God not only
   deigns to send His Son, but He sends Him in the likeness of sinful
   flesh. Christ did not come in sinful flesh, but He came in the likeness
   of sinful flesh. He came in the reality of flesh, but not in the
   sinfulness of flesh. His flesh was like sinful flesh, but it was not
   sinful flesh. It was real flesh, but it was not sinful flesh. It was
   the likeness of sinful flesh, for, as you looked upon Him, you could
   not tell Him from anyone else. That marvelous prophecy of Isaiah was
   fulfilled--"He has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see Him,

   there is no beauty that we should desire Him." He was "a Man of Sorrows
   and acquainted with grief." This was the likeness of sinful flesh which
   He assumed--to be poor, to be hungry, to be thirsty, to be despised, to
   be rejected, to be homeless, to be friendless, to be forsaken, to be
   betrayed, to be scourged, to be put to death! Yes, it was necessary
   that He should be "numbered with the transgressors," though without
   fault. "God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful

   flesh."

   There is in the world this strange thing called sin--a discord which
   mars the harmony of God's universe--a blight which makes evil that
   which God at first pronounced to be "very good." Sin! We cannot get
   away from it. We know more of it than of our most familiar friend--it
   meets us everywhere and in everything. Sin! It is the history of
   humanity. It is the history of the Bible, for why else was it written?
   It is the history of this building--why else was it built? It is the
   history of the ordinances of worship--why else were they instituted?
   Best of all, it is the history of the Christ of God!

   This is a very amazing story which I am telling you, but I have not yet
   told you all. When the Father sends His Only-Begotten and Well-Beloved
   Son, He sends Him on account of sin. "For sin." Why did You come here,
   sweet Babe, away from the royalties of Heaven? "I came because of sin."
   What brought you here, dear Child, sojourning 12 years at Nazareth?
   "Sin brought Me here," says the Boy. "I came on My Father's business,
   and that is to put away sin." What brought You here, dear Lord, coming
   up dripping from the waters of Jordan? "Ask My servant John," He says.
   And John answers, "Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of
   the world." If I question our Divine Savior at any period of His
   life--and even at His death, "Why are You here?" He will tell me, "I am
   here for two reasons--for love and for sin--here because men have
   sinned and here because I love them and would save them from their
   sin."--

   "'Twas love that sought Gethsemane,

   Or Judas never had found Thee.

   'Twas love that nailed You to the tree,

   Or iron never had bound Thee.

   'Twas love that lived, 'twas love that died,

   With endless life to bless us!

   Well have You won Your blood-bought bride,

   All hail! You glorious Jesus."

   I must ask you to notice the marginal reading here--"by a sacrifice for
   sin." The Revised Version has it, "God, sending His own Son in the
   likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, condemned sin in
   the flesh." He sends Him to be a Sacrifice for sin. Christ came here to
   be offered up as a Sin Offering! Our sin was laid on Him and when God
   came to visit sin, He found it laid on Christ--and He smote it there.
   There God cursed the evil thing, for Christ "was made a curse for us."
   Yes, He killed it--for Christ drank of the cup of death, even as we
   read, "that He, by the Grace of God, should taste death for every man."
   Wonderful is this doctrine! In that the Law was weak through the flesh
   and could not save us, God sent His own Son to be Incarnate here in the
   likeness of sinful flesh, to be offered up as a Sacrifice, to be
   presented as the Atonement for human guilt--"For Christ also has once
   suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to
   God." He has once suffered, "to declare at this time, God's
   righteousness, that He might be just, and the Justifier of him which
   believes in Jesus."

   Only one other word and I have completed the first verse. God does all
   this and He thus condemns sin in the flesh. "For sin" or, "by a sin
   offering," we read, He "condemned sin in the flesh." Christ's death
   condemned sin! You may find strong words with which to censure sin and
   you may talk of the bitter effects of sin, but no words can be too
   strong, no picture too dark to set forth the evil thing! What a curse
   sin is to this world of ours! You point me to the graveyard and you
   ask, "Who slew all these?" Sin! You point me to the prison and you ask,
   "Who bound all these?" Sin! You point me to the misery of this great
   city--the drunkenness, the wantonness, the selfishness, the crime--and
   ask, "What caused all this?" Sin! And you may even lift the veil and
   bid me gaze into the awful future where souls lie beneath the ban of
   God, accursed forever, and ask, "What brought man into such a plight?"
   Sin! Sin did it all, and we will, we must, condemn the cause of such
   horrors!

   But, I tell you, sin was never so condemned as when Jesus died. By His
   death, Jesus, in effect, said, "Sinners have died--sinners have been
   cast into Hell. Their sin deserved it." But He said more than that, for
   when sin was laid on Him, it was taken by Him as a deed of love! It was
   not His sin. He had done no evil. That the sin was on Him was an act of
   supreme Grace! He took the awful load willingly and bore it in the
   place of guilty men. He was innocent, yet, because of

   man's sin, He must die--even He must die! This blot must put out, not
   the candles and the moon and the stars, but the sun, itself! This
   poison is so virulent that not only must the mortal die, but the
   Immortal must bow His head and give up the ghost. Oh, Sin, you are a
   poisonous thing, indeed, to slay God's own Son! All Heaven and earth
   unite with one voice to say that you are hateful and abhorrent! You are
   condemned!

   If there is a king in a country and he has made a law, and there is one
   who is brought before him and condemned-- and that person is his own
   son--we may be assured of his strict justice. If the king carries out
   the law upon the prince and puts him in prison, everyone is assured
   that he respects the law. If there is proved against the prince an
   offense whose penalty is death and the king gives up, even, his own
   guilty son to death, you see how he vindicates the law and how he
   abhors the offense charged against the prince. And God never showed His
   justice, as well as His love so much as when He gave up His Son! And He
   never showed His hatred of evil so much as when, sin being by
   imputation laid upon Christ, He bade Him die and Christ, "became
   obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross." Now is sin condemned
   as the vilest thing in the universe! It has slain the Christ! It has
   forced the hand of Divine Justice to smite down even Christ, Himself,
   instead of guilty men!

   This is the story more marvelous than all the annals of earth! I have
   told it to you in simple language. You will hear some men talk very
   grandly about it--with much argument and vain philosophy. That is not
   my business! I have only to tell you the story as it stands. "God
   sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
   condemned sin in the flesh." This is God's glorious method of salvation
   and deliverance from sin!

   II. Now I am going to show you, in a few words, what is, through this,
   GOD'S GLORIOUS ACHIEVEMENT. The result is "that the righteousness of
   the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but
   after the Spirit." This righteousness is fulfilled in two ways.

   First, in Christ the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled. It is
   vindicated. This is how the matter stood. God has justly annexed a
   penalty to sin. It is right that the offender should be punished. I,
   guilty by God's Law, am condemned to punishment. But I am one with
   Christ. Christ is my Adam. He stands for me. I am a member of His body,
   joined to Him in mystical, yet real, union. He comes in and answers for
   me. He takes the sin as though He had committed it, though He could
   never commit sin. He bares His neck to the ax and suffers what I ought
   to have suffered, or suffers what is more than equivalent, thereunto,
   and so God's Law is vindicated. I have died, for I am one with Christ
   and He died for me, and I have died in Him. I have borne the wrath of
   God, for I am one with Him and He bore the wrath of God for me. Thus
   the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in every Believer because his
   accepted Substitute and Surety has borne the punishment! The two
   doctrines of "Substitution" and "Union to Christ" must always go
   together. The second explains the first, and the first becomes possible
   because of the second! Christ's death was a substitution for me because
   in the Covenant of Grace I am united to Him by bonds which can never be
   broken.

   "Then that is an end of the Law," says one. Stop--the Law of God has
   one great demand--obedience! If a man disobeys and is punished, he does
   not, thereby, escape from the duty of obedience. The law is still upon
   him, saying, Obey, obey! "Oh, but I have been punished for past
   offenses." Even so, but you still are bound to obey. The law is always
   our creditor for a perfect obedience. Where, then, have we this? I
   answer, Christ fulfilled the Law. There never was such a Law-fulfiller
   as He! He did it willingly. He did it from His heart. "Lo, I come," He
   said, "in the volume of the Book it is written of Me, I delight to do
   Your will, O My God: yes, Your Law is within My heart." He did it
   scrupulously. In Him was no sin. "I do always those things that please
   Him," said He of His Father. He was perfect. He kept the Law in every
   jot and tittle.

   There could not have been such obedience rendered to the Law even by
   sinless Adam as the Christ rendered to it. Adam had not the quality of
   being which would have rendered him capable of offering such an
   overflowing obedience as Christ rendered. Christ is God and if He
   becomes obedient to the Law--if He is born under the Law, comes under
   it and carries it out--the Law receives from such a Person, so
   marvelously constituted, a higher fulfillment than it could have
   received from any mere man! I take, today, the perfect obedience of my
   Lord and, appropriating it by faith to myself, I call Him, "The Lord my
   righteousness." I do not presume in so doing, for it is written, "This
   is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS"
   and, "of Him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." In
   Christ Jesus you have done for you what the Law

   could never have done. The righteousness of the Law has been fulfilled
   in you. You have borne the penalty--you have obeyed the Law of God in
   the Person of your Covenant Head and Representative.

   Now I take the words in the second and inferior sense, which is still
   very precious. The righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in the
   Christian by the Grace of God. When we believe in Christ we not only
   receive pardon, but we also receive renewal. I am told that the
   teaching of certain people, nowadays, is that the Believer only gets
   pardon to begin with and a long time afterwards he gets the clean
   heart. But I say, on the authority of God's Word, that no man is
   pardoned unless he has a clean heart! God gives the clean heart at the
   time He gives the pardon! You must never divide the renewing of the
   Holy Spirit from the pardon of sin. They go together and he that
   receives the pardon of sin receives a new birth--and is made a new
   creature in Christ Jesus then and there. The work of regeneration and
   the act of faith which brings justification to the penitent sinner are
   simultaneous and must, in the nature of the case, always be so.

   At the present moment, the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in the
   new-born, Grace-renewed mind. There is a present obedience actually
   rendered. We have to admit to faults, imperfections and sins, but, at
   the same time we strive to be holy. I speak for all of you who love
   Christ. You long to obey Him. Yes, and you do obey Him. You have laid
   aside the works of the flesh. If you are Believers, you cannot do what
   you used to do, and you are striving to do things which once would have
   been irksome to you. You are honest, you are true, you are righteous,
   you love the Lord. You make Him-- not an idol--to be your God. You are
   seeking to do to others as you would that they should do to you. You
   love God and you love your neighbor.

   And though not perfectly, yet, in a large measure, by the exercise of
   the Grace of God, the Law is fulfilled in you in a way that it never
   could have been fulfilled as mere law. You now obey God and attain a
   measure of holiness through what Christ has done for you--a measure of
   holiness that you never reached when you tried to be saved by good
   works. It is a noteworthy fact that while work-mongers cry up works,
   they never have any worth talking about--and while Believers in Christ
   decry their own good works, they abound in them! I try to live as if my
   salvation depended only upon my works--and yet I do so knowing all the
   while that I am justified by faith, through Jesus Christ--and not by
   the works of the Law. Thus present obedience is actually rendered.

   Now we must go a little further. There is perfect obedience rendered in
   heart. You know how Paul puts it. He says that the things that he would
   do, somehow he did not always do and that caused him grief. And the
   things that he would not do, but hated to do, he sometimes did and that
   caused him grief. But he says, "If I do that I would not, it is no more
   I that does it, but sin that dwells in me." The child of God is not
   perfect in his life, but he wills to be so--he sighs to be so--his
   heart is set on it. It reminds me of Mr. Bunyan when he says, "You see
   a man sent to get the doctor and riding on a horse that is rather
   sluggish. But look how he keeps kicking and whipping; whipping and
   kicking; pulling and tugging. He would go quicker if he could. So in
   his heart he is all the way to the doctor's when he is only half-way!
   He is all the way there in his mind, though, alas, his horse keeps him
   back." It is thus that we are hindered through the weakness of the
   flesh.

   O Brothers and Sisters, if we could be perfect, we would be in Heaven,
   for I cannot imagine a higher Heaven than to be perfectly like Christ!
   A sinner, if he could have his way, would like to have some nice little
   smug sins all to himself and never be called to account for them. He
   would choose forever to have no God and no Law of God. How delicious
   that would be to him! And then if he let his evil heart have full sway,
   he would desire to have his glass, his merriment, his debauchery free
   from any restraint! His liberty would soon run into license. That would
   be the highest pleasure to the child of the flesh. But the child of God
   hates sin as sin! He loves holiness as holiness and if he could go to
   Heaven and sin, it would be no Heaven to him! And if God could reward
   him for sin--though such a thing is impossible and the very thought of
   such a thing is almost blasphemy--yet would he hate sin as sin and flee
   from it!

   Even when it most condemns him, he would have the Law of God no other
   than it is. Not even for his salvation would he have God bate one jot
   or tittle of His justice. He is jealous for holiness and seeks not to
   be saved in sin, but to be saved from it. As far as his renewed heart
   is concerned, he cannot sin because he is born of God. His new nature
   clings and cleaves to holiness and the new nature is perfect--made
   perfect in the image of Christ--and it will never rest till it has
   stamped out the last spark of sin in the members. Thus a perfect
   obedience is rendered in his heart. The child of God says, "I will walk
   within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before
   my eyes--I hate the work of them that turn aside--it shall not cleave
   to me."

   Once more, what the Law could never do--for it never made a man even
   wish to be holy, much less made him live a holy life--Christ, by coming
   in the likeness of sinful flesh, has done, for there is that in every
   Believer which will be perfect holiness before long. Absolute obedience
   is observed in Heaven. We shall, by-and-by, break through all the
   en-thrallments of the old life and come into the land of the hereafter,
   where, says the Christ who has done all for them, "They shall walk with
   Me in white: for they are worthy." Up yonder the life that is in every
   palm-bearer is the life that he had here below. "He that believes on
   the Son has everlasting life," that is, he has it here--and in Heaven
   it will be the same life, but it will be that same life developed--and
   when developed it will be absolute perfection! Not perfection in name,
   nor perfection in measure, but absolute perfection and fully developed!
   We shall be absolutely free from every disobedience and absolutely
   perfect in every good work, doing God's will and delighting to do it,
   world without end!

   In the third place, I would have you remember that this righteousness
   is fulfilled through the Lord Jesus Christ. We fulfill the Law, but not
   in any strength which the Law gives to us, nor in any power of our own.
   The obedience to the Law is fulfilled in us out of gratitude to Christ
   for what He has done for us. We flee from sin out of hatred of the
   things that nailed Christ to the Cross and put Him to death. What the
   Law could not do, the dying Christ has done! His Sacrifice makes us
   hate evil. Naming the name of Christ, we "depart from iniquity," for we
   realize that it was not only Roman soldiers and rabble Jews who nailed
   Him to the tree, but it was our sins that did it! Those little sins of
   ours were like thorns in His blessed brow. Those ordinary commonplace
   sins were like nails in His hands and feet. That giant sin was like a
   spear to pierce His side. And yet--

   "His love to man, so sorely tried, Proved stronger than the grave! The
   very spear that pierced His side Drew forth the blood to save."

   O you who have long toiled in the vain endeavor to give up your sins,
   come and look at the Cross! See there what your sins have done and
   learn to hate them with a perfect hatred! See how sin stooped to the
   meanness of betrayal and killed the Prince of Life who went among men
   healing and helping them, doing nothing but good! Your instinct rises
   against oppressors--will you not seek to throw off the chains of the
   sin which worked so cruel a deed that day at Calvary? Sin is your
   enemy! To you who believe in Christ, I would say--Remember that on the
   Cross you were crucified, for when Christ died, you died. Now, say to
   yourself that if sin that day crucified you, then today you will
   crucify sin. "I am crucified with Christ," says Paul, "nevertheless I
   live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live
   in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me, and
   gave Himself for me." Thus, because God sent His Son and condemned sin
   in the flesh, we condemn it, too. His death becomes to us the gate of
   life!

   More than that. Not only do we seek to avoid the evil because of the
   Sacrifice of Christ, but gratitude to Him incites us to do good. Shall
   He do all this for me and I do nothing for Him? Shall He die for me and
   shall I henceforth not live for Him? If He gave His life for me, then I
   will give my life to Him! He has bought it. He deserves it and He shall
   have it. I will no longer live to the flesh, since in the flesh Christ
   condemned my sin. What a wonder it is that the Lord Jesus, by His
   Atonement, could condemn sin and let the condemned sinner go free!
   Surely, the delivered soul will henceforth count it the greatest joy of
   life to serve Him "who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised
   again for our justification." Thus, what the Law could not do, the Sent
   One, by His wondrous work, fulfils! He takes us from under the bondage
   of the Law and, in being delivered for our sins, He also delivers us
   from our sins! "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are
   not under the Law, but under Grace." Thus, Grace triumphs against the
   flesh in giving us liberty. "Being then made free from sin, you became
   the servants of righteousness." Thus the holy Law of God is cheerfully
   fulfilled!

   To crown all, this righteousness is fulfilled in the energy of the
   Spirit--"in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
   God not only works for us, but He also works in us "both to will and to
   do of His good pleasure." The Spirit applies the work of Christ to the
   soul, since it is because of the work of Christ the Spirit is given,
   while both are to the praise of the Father. "It needs the three Persons
   of the Trinity to fill up the triangular heart of man," as one of the
   Puritans puts it. Why should not everyone whom I address receive, by
   the Spirit, this new life at this moment? Then it will grow, for we
   "walk after the Spirit"--we do not stand still! As we obey the Law of
   God, we shall receive more and more of His power, for it is written of
   the Holy Spirit that He is "given to them that obey Him." He first
   teaches us to obey and then, when we obey, He dwells with us in greater
   fullness! And, when we are filled with the Spirit, then "the
   righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us who walk not after the
   flesh, but after the Spirit."

   I have now set before you God's glorious method and achievement. May
   you accept the one and have your part in the other! Sin is condemned
   and righteousness fulfilled for everyone that believes! That is what
   the Christ has done by coming here below. Blessed be His name! Amen.

God's Glorious and Everlasting Name

   (No. 2229)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 15, 1891.

   "To make Himself an everlasting name...To make Yourself a glorious
   name." Isaiah 63:12,14.

   MAN'S chief end is to glorify and enjoy God. God's greatest and highest
   objective is to make to Himself a glorious and an everlasting name.
   Since God is God, it must be so, for He is full of love and kindness to
   His creatures, and He cannot more fully bless His creatures than by
   making Himself known to them. Everything that is good, true, holy,
   excellent and loving, is in God. He is not only the Giver of "every
   good and every perfect gift," but He is, Himself, the sum and substance
   of all blessing! And it is for the highest good of all the creatures He
   has made, that they should know their God. "Man, know yourself," is a
   frequent exhortation of the philosophers of earth--and self-knowledge
   is said to be the highest form of knowledge, but it is not. "Man, know
   your God," is a far wiser precept, for knowledge of God as far excels
   all other knowledge as the heavens are higher than the earth! It is
   life eternal to know Him, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He
   has sent. Know your God, then, for here your hope, your comfort, your
   holiness, your Heaven will be found!

   God may well desire to make to Himself a name--that is to say, to make
   Himself known--because He is worthy to be known. There is no name so
   well worthy of publication. There is no Character like His. There is
   none that can be compared to Him. Even among the gods of the heathen,
   if they were gods, there is none like our God and, indeed, there is
   none other. He can truly say, "I am Jehovah, and there is none beside
   Me." He ought to be known and it is a worthy motive of His actions that
   He should make unto Himself a great name.

   This knowledge of God is the Heaven of the perfect! I believe they have
   no higher joy in the Land of Light than to know God. The blaze of their
   glory is the Presence of Deity. The height of their Heaven is that God
   is near them and that they are near to Him. Heaven would be no Heaven
   if God were not there. It would be a circle without a center, a sky
   without a sun! The holy song of the seraphim would be hushed--they
   would cease to veil their faces with their wings and the Hosannas of
   the redeemed would languish if they could no longer raise the
   hymn--"The Lord God Omnipotent reigns." Without the Presence of the
   Eternal, Heaven would be shorn of the bliss for which we long--and
   emptied of the Glory we have been led to anticipate! To know God
   perfectly and to behold Him in righteousness will be all that any heart
   can need--

   "How wonderful, how beautiful, The sight of You must be! Your glorious
   wisdom, boundless power, And awful purity."

   While the knowledge of God is the Heaven of the perfect, it is the help
   of the growing. Men can only get holier and better as they know more of
   God. Here is the copy--look well at it, that you may write after it.
   Here is that Character which you are to imitate, according to the
   exhortation, "Be you, therefore, followers of God, as dear children."
   Know God as He makes Himself known by His works and ways, that you may
   grow to be like He. Continue to know Him until you shall be able to say
   that He is the gladness of your joy and may join with the Psalmist and
   say, "I will go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy."

   The knowledge of God is also the great hope of sinners. O child of
   earth, if you knew Him better, you would fly to Him! If you understood
   how gracious He is, you would seek Him! If you could have any idea of
   His holiness, you would loathe your self-righteousness! If you knew
   anything of His power, you would not venture to contend with Him. If
   you knew anything of His Grace, you would not hesitate to yield
   yourself to Him. The more God reveals Himself to you and the more you
   know of God, the more are you in the way of hope and mercy! "They that
   know Your name will put their trust in You."

   Therefore I do not attempt to defend my God, nor stand here to
   apologize for Him when I assert that the one great end of all that He
   does is to make to Himself a name--since it is by the making of that
   name that men are blessed in the very highest degree--and helped to
   holiness and happiness! I would rather ask you to praise Him who sits
   upon the Throne, as He thus manifests Himself--for our good can only be
   achieved by the glory of God's name--

   "Who is a pardoning Godlike Thee, Or who has Grace so rich and free?"
   In seeking to open up this subject, I shall say, first of all, that
   God's design in making to Himself a great name has been accomplished.
   Secondly, this design is still being accomplished. And, thirdly, the
   design is, in itself, exceedingly delightful.

   I. First, GOD'S DESIGN HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. From everlasting He was
   God most glorious! He existed, but He had as yet no name. For a name is
   that by which someone is revealed--and until His power called into
   being the hosts of Heaven, God was God, and there were none to whom He
   could be known! Then the angels lifted high His praise in their songs
   and bowed low before His Throne. In creation His name was manifested
   and magnified--when the foundations of the earth were laid, "the
   morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy."
   Man was made in the image of God for His own Glory and all things
   existed for His praise. "He is over all, God blessed forever. Amen."
   But our subject is how God has made His name glorious among men. Let us
   consider it.

   The text speaks of God as making to Himself a great and glorious name,
   in redeeming Israel. When He poured His plagues on Egypt and afflicted
   the fields of Zoan, proud Pharaoh would not yield. He thought himself
   able to contend against Jehovah, but the tyrant trembled. He sought the
   intercession of Moses and, at last, he was glad to let Israel go! God
   triumphed over Pharaoh. When Pharaoh gathered up his spirit once
   more--his heart being hardened--he pursued Israel to the Red Sea and
   God permitted him to follow His people into the midst of the waters
   until the waves returned, in all their might, and quickly swallowed him
   up!

   Then sang the children of Israel, "The depths have covered them: they
   sank into the bottom as a stone." God's name was glorious that day
   insomuch that they sang again, "Who is like unto You, O Lord, among the
   gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
   wonders?" And not only that day, but as long as there is a man alive,
   the song of the Red Sea will be remembered and our ears shall hear the
   refrain of Miriam's song--"Sing you to the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea." All
   the nations of the earth heard of that event, especially the heathen
   races of Palestine! God intended to drive them out to make room for His
   people and a fear took hold of them. They trembled as they heard what
   God did at the Red Sea. He had made to Himself an everlasting name, for
   that one event goes ringing down the centuries! Throughout eternity the
   redeemed will continue to "sing the song of Moses, the servant of God,
   and the song of the Lamb." Then God brought His people through the
   wilderness, guiding them by His Presence, and He led them into the
   Promised Land. The revised Version renders verse fourteen-- "As the
   cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused them
   to rest: so did You lead Your people, to make Yourself a glorious
   name."

   Now, as God got to Himself a great name at the Red Sea, He has done
   much more by the great works of salvation in the gift of Jesus. Ah,
   here Egypt is eclipsed and the destruction of Pharaoh is no more to be
   remembered! We were lost-- sin had taken us captive, but God brought us
   out with a high hand and an outstretched arm. But for our redemption it
   was necessary that He should become Man, that in a human form God
   should tabernacle on earth! Would He come to Bethlehem's manger? Would
   He, the Infinite, come robed as an Infant? Yes, He came and made Heaven
   wonder till the angels sang and sang again! They could not understand
   the marvelous condescension of the Incarnation. Being here in fashion
   as a Man, it was necessary, if He would save us, that He must bear the
   wrath of God on our behalf. There must be a bloody sweat from that
   blessed body! There must be a scourging of those sacred shoulders!
   There must be a piercing of those dear hands and feet! There must be a
   rending open of that loving and holy heart!

   Shall it be done? Will the Son of God die like a felon on a gallows?
   Will the Lord of Glory give His back to the smit-ers and His cheeks to
   them that pluck off the hair? Will He yield His face to shame and
   spitting? Will He, can He di'e?

   Death, you have slain your millions--will you also slay the Son of God?
   It must be so if we are to live--He must die, or we must die, or
   justice must die! Which shall it be? Jesus solves the problem--He
   deigns to die. As I see Him bow His blessed head and hear Him utter His
   death-cry, "It is finished," I say that the Most High has gotten to
   Himself an everlasting name, a glorious name--"For God so loved the
   world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him
   should not perish, but have everlasting life." All other deeps are
   shallow! This is an abyss! All other heights of goodness can be
   climbed--but this--never! Pile Andes on Pelion, Alp on Alp, the
   Matterhorn on Mont Blanc and the Andes on the Himalayas--all are not
   great enough to be a symbol of His love! The Incarnate Son of God
   condemned! The Son of God slain! The Son of God in the grave! And all
   this for us! Truly, He has made Himself a glorious name! Saints on
   earth and saints above unite to sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was
   slain!" And forever and ever we shall know no choicer song.

   Furthermore, I am sure you will agree with me that He has made Himself
   a glorious name by taking so many of the saints already into Heaven.
   His design has been accomplished in the saints in Glory. Some of our
   dearest ones are there, where no trouble can ever reach them again.
   Yes, they are now beyond gunshot of the enemy! I am sure that they give
   Him a glorious name. Oh, how they stand and wonder that ever they
   should have been brought there! How they lie adoring at His feet,
   marveling that by such a stoop of His love, they should be lifted to
   such a height of Glory! Listen how their hearts ring out the
   never-ceasing music! You sleep and your songs are suspended--but day
   without night they circle His Throne rejoicing--and this is the strain
   of all their music--"Glory, glory, glory unto the Triune Jehovah who
   has brought us to stand before the Throne of God."--

   "Father of Jesus, love's reward,

   What rapture will it be!

   Prostrate before Your Throne to lie,

   And gaze, and gaze on Thee!"

   When you and I get to Heaven, we will give God a glorious name, will we
   not? I have often told you of the old woman who said that if Christ
   saved her, He would never hear the last of it. Nor shall He ever cease
   to receive the praises of us all when He once gives us an opportunity
   of joining yonder happy choir! We will not wish to pause in the
   perpetual outpourings of our adoration and worship. "I heard a voice
   from Heaven," says John, "as the voice of many waters, and as the voice
   of a great thunder." I do not wonder at that description of the songs
   of the redeemed, for when we all together shall praise His everlasting
   and glorious name, our united thanksgiving will be like the sound of
   oceans upon oceans piled, Atlantics upon Pacifics, Arctics upon these,
   Indian Oceans upon them all--and all together roaring with the fullness
   thereof in the majesty of praise unto the great Eternal! God has,
   indeed, made Himself a name! There is no name like the name of
   Jehovah-Jesus under Heaven, or in Heaven itself! At that name the
   angels pause! To speak its praise they fly! All the earth worships You,
   the Everlasting Father. To You, O God, we cry aloud with hearty voices
   of praise and when we have paid our fullest homage, we feel that we
   have scarcely reached the lowest note of the anthem we long to sing!
   Faint is our song compared with what You deserve!--

   "Weak is the effort of my heart,

   And cold my warmest thought!

   But when I see You as You are,

   I'll praise You as I ought."

   So much for the first point.

   II. Now, secondly, GOD'S DESIGN IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED. In many ways the
   grand work is still going forward. God is carrying out His gracious
   plan. "My Father works hitherto, and I work," Christ might still truly
   say, as He once said at Jerusalem. And the Holy Spirit, whom He has
   given, also labors towards the same end--that the name of the Triune
   God may be exalted!

   This purpose is being fulfilled, first, in sparing the provoking. There
   was one who said, "If there is a God, let Him prove it by striking me
   dead." God proved His Godhead by letting that sinner live! Had He been
   a man such as we are, He would have struck the blasphemer on the spot!
   But God will not be provoked. He is "long-suffering, and plenteous in
   mercy." Oh, if some of us had been treated with a thousandth part of
   the hatred that men have poured on God, we would have struck out in
   strength of indignation--and we might have been excused--but God has
   borne it all! They have denied His existence. They have blasphemed His
   Word. They have resisted His Spirit. They have questioned the Deity of
   His

   Son. What have they not done? And yet He has been patient to get to
   Himself a name as the "God of Patience," and that name will stand
   forever. Would that this long-suffering of God might lead men to
   repentance!

   Next, God gets to Himself a name in turning the rebellious to Himself.
   Oh, I delight to see this done! It is the minister's joy! We know men
   that have been, for years, set in opposition to God, and we had almost
   thought it impossible that they should ever be turned, but, all of a
   sudden, Christ has manifested Himself to them and we hear that they are
   seeking after God! Such conversions very often surprise me, especially
   when persons come or write to me out of families that have been famous
   for unbelief, or out of wealthy families where there is all manner of
   gaiety and worldliness, or out of poor families where there has been a
   disregard of God's Holy Day. Such cases, in which the work is evidently
   God's, seem to me like miracles of mercy!

   Last Wednesday, when seeing those who came to join the Church, to one
   after another I said, "Have you a godly father or mother?" and many of
   them answered, "No, Sir." Then I said, "perhaps it was your brother or
   sister who influenced you for Christ," to which several replied, "I am
   sorry to say none of my brothers or sisters are Christians." In several
   cases I asked further, "Have you, then, some friend who fears God?" and
   often the answer was, "I do not know one of my family that has been
   accustomed, even, to pay any outward reverence to religion." Yet the
   Grace of God has come into that home and taken one of a family--to
   bring that one to Zion--and it has sometimes happened that the least
   likely has been the very one who has been called! I should not wonder
   but some young man who came to this service to make fun of the whole
   thing will find something better than fun before the service is
   over--and be among those who shall preach the Gospel which once he
   despised!

   It has often happened that when men have gone far in sin, they have
   been stopped by Grace. There is a strange incident in Bunyan's life
   which tells us of the strange reason with which he comforted himself
   about the next generation. He said that the young men of his day were
   so wicked, that he hoped that God meant to make great saints of them.
   It was an extraordinary way of looking at evil, but there is a basis of
   the Truth of God in such a view. "Where sin abounded, Grace did much
   more abound." Is it not written of the very offcasts and outcasts, the
   enemies to God, those in the isles afar off, who have not heard God's
   fame, neither seen His Glory, "I will also take of them for priests and
   for Levites, says the Lord"? God will take these, in the Sovereignty of
   His Grace, to conquer them and make to Himself a name! Then everybody
   will say, greatly wondering, "Has that notorious blasphemer really been
   converted? Has that gay butterfly actually become serious? Does that
   careless, godless person at last begin to think of these things?" Ah,
   glory be to God, it is by these conversions that He gets to Himself a
   glorious name!

   Again, He gets to Himself a name in forgiving the guilty. When the
   great sinner comes, or the person who, though he has not openly
   offended, is yet conscious of great inward sin--when these come and in
   a moment are washed whiter than snow, and realize that their sin is put
   away, forever, they cannot help crying, like a man in Scotland, of whom
   I heard, who, when he spoke the praises of Christ who had saved him
   from the wrath to come, said, in his joy--"Oh, He is a great Forgiver!
   Oh, He is a great Forgiver!" You remember how the Prophet Micah writes
   of this great Forgiver, "Who is a God like unto You, that pardons
   iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of His
   heritage? He retains not His anger forever, because He delights in
   mercy. He will turn again, He will have compassion upon us; He will
   subdue our iniquities and will cast all our sins into the depths of the
   sea"? Hallelujah! Every soul that gets the pardon of all its sin must
   magnify the Lord! And if you know to the fullest what that pardon is,
   it will make you give God a great name--

   "Here's pardon for transgressions past, It matters not how black their
   cast. And, O my Soul, with wonder view, For sins to come, here's
   pardon, too." Who would not give God glory when He gives such mercy?

   Further, God glorifies His name in purifying the unholy. It is a great
   honor to God when we see men and women who were once very wild and
   self-willed, walking carefully and graciously. I do not know that I
   have ever praised God more than I did in the case of a Brother of a
   very savage temper who was, indeed, just like an incarnate devil at
   times! But after he was converted, he became as quiet as a lamb and
   just as gentle as he had formerly been ferocious. God got a great name
   through that change--and such things happen a great deal more
   frequently than some doubters imagine! The man who was so stingy that
   he would have drawn the teeth of his motherless child to sell them if
   he could, after he is converted becomes so generous that he can keep no
   money in his pocket when there are any poor people in need! The Grace
   of God

   makes such a difference, turning things upside down and completely
   altering the character! Grace renews the man and God is greatly
   glorified thereby! It is, in fact, the fulfillment of the ancient
   promise--"Instead of the thorn, shall come up the fir tree, and instead
   of the briar shall come up the myrtle tree." Instead of vice, lust,
   passion and self-seeking, there comes up holiness, love to God, love to
   men and every amiable virtue. Then God's name is glorified! Dear
   Christian people, do try to glorify His name. May your life be such
   that whoever watches you shall be compelled to say, "Truly, God's name
   is glorified in them!" Let all behold the clear shining of your light
   until they "see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
   Heaven."

   God also glorifies His name in preserving the tempted. Oh, what stories
   each one might tell of himself! How God has kept us in the time of
   great temptation! I know that some of you here are fiercely tempted.
   God has brought you out from sin, but the devil pulls you back as far
   as ever he can. And your surroundings do not help you. Your companions
   would, if they could, drag you with them into Hell. Now, if the Lord
   keeps you, it will be greatly to His Glory and He will get to Himself a
   glorious name! I have noticed that Christian men who seem to live in
   the greatest danger are not those who fall, but those who backslide are
   often those whose circumstances appear to be peculiarly favorable. Yet
   they wander and go astray. God will keep you if you stay yourself upon
   Him, though your business sometimes leads you to the edge of a
   precipice! God will keep you, if you rely upon His power, though your
   position in society surrounds you with dangers.

   Be of good hope and continue to put your trust in Him. In your case, He
   will make to Himself a name, even now! And at the end what praise shall
   be His when you are brought safely home! Here comes into Heaven the man
   who has been between the jaws of death! He has walked right straight
   between the lions--they sniffed at his heels and they would have
   devoured him if they could. He went through the Valley of the Shadow of
   Death where the hobgoblins were on either side, where the fierce
   Apollyon met him and he had to fight him, foot to foot! But God has
   brought him safely home. Hallelujah! Oh, what a name will God have in
   saving His people from all their temptations!

   To change the subject just a little--I believe that God gets a great
   name to Himself in using weak instruments. If you go to hear a great
   and learned man preach the Gospel--some doctor of divinity, some
   famously eloquent man--if there are souls saved, you say, "Ah, well! He
   is a wonderful man, a clever man. It is to be expected that great
   blessing will come of such preaching." But if, on the other hand, if it
   is some person by whom God is pleased to speak who makes no pretense of
   learning, but who uses common words--and yet many are led into the
   Light of God by him--you say to yourself, "Well, I could speak better
   than that! What a wonder that God can do such a mighty work with such a
   poor implement!" When God speaks by the feeble. When He uses the
   insignificant, then does He not get to Himself a glorious name? I hear
   almost every day in the week of souls converted to God by sermons
   preached here, which go to the ends of the earth. And when I hear about
   them, I always wonder that God should have blessed those sermons to
   anybody. And any man whom God favors with His Presence and help will
   marvel that God should use such a poor, dry stick! But He does and He
   will, for, "base things of the world, and things which are despised,
   has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing
   things that are." And all this to make unto Himself a glorious name!

   Sometimes our God makes to Himself a glorious name in doing great
   things for His people by sending very wonderful seasons of refreshing
   and reviving to His Church. Some misunderstood me the other day to
   speak against revivals. I never did such a thing in my life! The more
   revivals we have of a true sort, the better. What I do speak against is
   the kind of thing which works people up into an excitement and then
   lets them drop. I read only last night of a Methodist congregation, of
   which the writer says, "They are a wonderfully nice people. They have a
   revival about once in seven years and then everybody seems to feel
   intensely, and you can preach with great power. But in between the
   times of those revivals, they are as hard as old nails."

   Well now, I do not want that kind of thing! Spasms of any sort are not
   desirable things, least of all spasmodic religion! I want a revival
   that keeps on every day in the year, all the years in the century! That
   is the kind of revival that glorifies God--not a temporary ripple on
   the surface--but a great swell that comes rolling up from the depths!
   May God send it! He can do such a work by His Spirit and there are
   indications that He is going to permit us to see greater things than
   ever. All these many years, in this place, souls have been saved in one
   continued stream by the preaching of the Gos-pel--scarcely ever more
   and very seldom less--but oh, for a grand spring tide, a mighty flood
   that shall bring many to Christ and to the Church! Then it shall be
   that God will get to Himself a glorious and an everlasting name!

   In this manner God is now accomplishing His gracious design and will,
   still, in days to come, get to Himself a name most glorious. These are
   but the beginnings of His ways--the fullness of them will overwhelm us
   with their grandeur and majesty! Having begun to reveal His name and
   Character, He will go on to do it. He will carve it deep on the history
   of His redeemed. Blessed be His name for the seasons of revival we have
   already had and are having, but our hearts look forward with high hope
   to even better times when, as Peter preached after Pentecost, "Times of
   refreshing shall come from the Presence of the Lord and He shall send
   Jesus Christ." Then, indeed, the Lord will get to Himself a glorious
   name! "The times of restitution of all things" will begin and, as
   Habakkuk tells us, "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the
   Glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."

   God has not ceased His working. He will go on doing great things. It is
   His purpose to make to Himself an everlasting name, as well as a
   glorious name. Everlasting and glorious! That can only mean to us
   everlasting Glory! Beyond this, we have the promise of some Grace not
   yet revealed, for it is written concerning the man who overcomes, "I
   will write upon him My new name." Yes, God will yet accomplish His
   purpose and fully manifest His Glory!

   III. Having thus tried to show you how God carries out the purpose of
   making to Himself a glorious name, let me go on, in the third place, to
   say that GOD'S DESIGN IS VERY DELIGHTFUL. I will advance five reasons
   why we should rejoice in this fact.

   For God to save and bless men, in order to get to Himself a glorious
   name, is a very delightful thing, first, because it hides pride from
   men. And anything that does that is glorifying to Him. Remember these
   words--"Not for your sakes do I this, says the Lord God, be it known
   unto you; be ashamed and be confounded for your own ways, O house of
   Israel." God did not choose His people because of anything in them.
   Christ did not redeem His people because of anything in them. The Holy
   Spirit does not call a man because of anything in him. We are not
   justified because of our own merits-- we are not accepted because of
   our own excellence. It is all of Grace from first to last! "Where is
   boasting, then? It is excluded." There is no place where pride can come
   in. Salvation is "not of works, lest any man should boast."

   The second reason is because it opens a great door for sinners. Now,
   listen to this. Perhaps there is one here who says, "I am so guilty. I
   am so unworthy. I am so vile that God cannot save me on account of
   anything in me. I am everything that I ought not to be." Stand to that,
   Brothers and Sisters! Tire not there. You have a hold of the Truth this
   time! "Then why should He save me?" you ask. "It cannot be because of
   any use that He can make of me, for I am ignorant. I am obscure and I
   am weak-minded. God can never get much out of me--He cannot save me for
   the sake of that." But look, Sir, He can save you that He may make a
   great name for Himself, for if He pardons you, a great sinner, that
   will bring great praise to His mercy! If He changes you, who has been
   desperately set on mischief, that will bring great credit to His power!
   If He takes you who are so insignificant and obscure, that will clearly
   show the greatness of His condescension and the wondrousness of His
   love!

   I am not sure, but I think that if God were to save any of you, I
   should not wonder at it so much as I often wonder that He should have
   saved me! I sometimes ask myself whether I was converted because I was
   so headstrong and obstinate, that God might show how He can overcome
   obstinacy and how self-will can be made to sit at His feet. You
   remember what the Scotchwoman said to Rowland Hill when she stood
   looking at his face? He said, "Well, good woman, you have looked at me
   a long while. What are you looking at?" She said, "I was looking at the
   lines of your face." "Well, and what do you make of them?" he asked. "I
   was thinking what an awful rascal you would have been if you had not
   been converted," was her unexpected answer!

   Now, I think that we might say the same of a good many, and if it is
   God's intent to get to Himself a glorious name, I see hope for big
   rascals! I see hope for great sinners! If a doctor has come into a
   parish and needs to get a reputation. And if he can cure those who have
   a finger-ache, those who have something the matter with a corn, he will
   not get much credit by that. But here is a man who has cancer--here is
   a woman ill in consumption. If he can cure these two, I guarantee you
   that all the world will know of it before long! If he can manage these
   desperate cases, that all the other doctors have given up, then he will
   get to himself a name!

   Now, is there some cancerous sinner here, some soul in a dread
   consumption of evil? I pray you, come to Christ, for He wants to get to
   Himself a name--and why should He not save you? Is there not reason to
   believe that He is likely to begin with the worst, that He may get to
   Himself glory out of such? Would God you would pick the comfort out of
   this Truth of God, for there is a vast amount of consolation lying
   hidden in it! Great sinners make great saints! God loves the

   love of His people! And those who have been saved from deep sin are
   often most fervent in their devotion. To procure such love to Himself
   and such honor to His name, God lays hold of the rebellious sinner, who
   afterwards sings--

   "Love I much? I've more forgiven;

   I'm a miracle of Grace!"

   Next, this grand Truth that God does what He does for the Glory of His
   own name, is delightful because it gives comfort to strugglers. You who
   are laboring after holiness. You who are striving after purity, in full
   obedience to the Divine will, do you not see that if God will help you
   in your struggles and give you victory, it will be to the Glory of His
   name? The weaker you are, the more glory to Him if He makes you strong!
   And the more beaten you seem to be, the more nearly defeated, the more
   glory to God if He will come to your rescue and help you through.
   Therefore expect that He will do it! "The name of the Lord is a strong
   tower, the righteous runs into it and is safe." Run into it and, for
   His name's sake expect the Lord to keep you! At length He will deliver
   us from our enemies and bring us into the place of peace--and "there
   the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams;
   wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall any gallant ship
   pass thereby. For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the
   Lord is our King: He will save us." For the glory of His own name He
   will do this.

   The confidence that God is working out His designs is delightful,
   again, because it sustains in trying times. I think that this ought to
   gladden you very much. You should be delighted that God seeks His own
   Glory, for He will find it in helping you in the time of trouble. "Call
   upon Me," He says, "in the day of trouble. I will deliver you and you
   shall glorify Me." It is not for God's Glory to leave one of His poor
   children to perish. It is not for God's Glory to leave the least lamb
   in all His flock to be eaten by the wolf. If the devil could get one
   who trusted Christ, what a triumph they would make in Hell over that
   soul! "Here is one whom Christ could not save, or would not save," they
   would mockingly shout. "Here is a soul who trusted in Christ and yet is
   lost, after all!" Oh, the gibes and jests which would then be uttered
   against the Savior who is mighty to save! But this shall never be! It
   would make such a stain upon the honor, fidelity, Immutability and
   Glory of God, that it cannot even be imagined! His Glory will never be
   compromised in such a way as that--

   "The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose,

   I will not, I will not desert to his foes!

   That soul, though all Hell should endeavor to shake,

   I'll never, no never, no never forsake!" And, once more, it is most
   delightful that God should seek His own Glory, for you and I, and all
   of us who know anything of His Grace, are seeking it, too. It answers
   our chief prayer. We are the children of God and His honor is dear to
   us. When we come to Him and say, "Our Father who are in Heaven," our
   first desire is, "Hallowed be Your name." I speak to many who can add
   their, "Amen," to this! If you could have your greatest, chief, highest
   wish, would you not say, "I wish that God may be glorified"? I met a
   dear Brother minister last week and he said to me, "My wife is sick and
   ill, and I have a world of troubles, but I do not feel them half so
   much as I do the burden of the present condition of the professing
   Church. God is dishonored in His own Church and that weighs me down." I
   could respond and say, "That is my case, too." The heaviest trouble of
   my soul is to see things as they now are in Christendom--and if I might
   have but one prayer, and pray it, it would be, "O God, glorify Yourself
   in Your own Church and in the salvation of men!" And do you not think
   that the desire of every true Christian is, "Let God be magnified"? Is
   not this the wish of Heaven? What is Heaven, but a perpetual magnifying
   of God? It will be the crown of all rejoicing to be able to--

   "Crown Him with many crowns,

   The Lamb upon His Throne."

   Therefore we rejoice and think it delightful that God is aiming at the
   manifestation of His own Character and, is in all His works getting to
   Himself a great, eternal, and glorious name! Come, you sinners, poor
   and wretched, come and glorify the bounty of God! Come, you that are at
   Hell's dark door, arise and glorify the greatness of the love of God in
   Christ Jesus! Whoever among you will believe in Christ shall have
   eternal life! Trust the living Christ who is gone into the heavens to
   intercede for sinners! Trust Him and you shall live and God shall be
   glorified in your life. Come, saying--

   "No preparation can I make,

   My best resolves I only break!

   Now save me for Your own name's sake,

   And take me as I am."

   He will do it! He will do it now! When He does it, He does it forever.
   I pray the Holy Spirit to bless these words to the salvation of many,
   that the Triune Jehovah may get to Himself a glorious and everlasting
   name, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON:

   Beloved Friends--I was supremely thankful to telegraph to London that I
   was not wearied by my journey of a thousand miles, but rather refreshed
   by it. I wrote that this was "almost miraculous," and my dear brother
   observed that I might wisely leave out the, "almost," and so save two
   pence, which is the rate per word! Well, it does seem to me to be
   beyond all that I could have asked or even thought. Blessed be the
   healing Lord! I am waiting and watching for news from home as
   remarkable in regard to a Tabernacle revival as these tidings from me
   about my restoration to health. I now look for great things in
   connection with Dr. Pierson's labors and those of all my friends at
   home. Good news has already reached me as to the usefulness of the
   printed sermons, but I long for more. To spread my sermons is to help
   on the cause in the most efficient manner. To pray for a blessing is to
   share in it. Why should we not see a renewal of faith, a
   re-enthronement of the Truth of God, a deep and widespread revival of
   religion at home and a grand advance of missions abroad? According to
   your faith be it unto you, you heirs of the heavenly Kingdom! Your
   fellow servant, Mentone, October 31, 1891. C H. SPURGEON.

Loved and Washed

   (No. 2230)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 22, 1891.

   "Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
   and has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be
   glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen." Revelation 1:5, 6.

   John was the beloved disciple, the choicest spirit of the twelve, the
   one nearest to the heart of Christ. Not only was he that disciple whom
   Jesus loved, but he was full of love to his Lord in return. John leaned
   his head on Christ's bosom. All his soul seemed to be aflame with
   affection towards Christ. "We love Him, because He first loved us," are
   words which come with great power from such a heart--they were so
   wonderfully true in his own experience. But now, when he comes to sing
   a Psalm of praise to his Lord, he does not mention his love to his
   Master. He dwells not on that, for his confidence lies deeper than
   anything in himself, even in the love of the Son of God to him. Would
   you not wish to be like he? Then "keep yourselves in the love of God,"
   as, on the opposite page of your Bible, you read in the Epistle of
   Jude. Meditate much on your Master and on your Master's love--dwell
   with Christ--and whether you realize your love to Him or not, drink in
   daily the sweetness of His wondrous love to you. Live on that and often
   let your heart lift up a song of praise because of it. Then shall the
   blessing of Benjamin be yours--"The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in
   safety by Him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he
   shall dwell between His shoulders."

   This verse seems to me to be fit to be the song of Heaven. It is indeed
   the epitome of all those choral symphonies with which redeemed spirits
   circle the Throne of our great Lord and King. John, in vision, had
   caught glimpses of the Glory Land and had heard the great multitude
   which no man can number raise their hallelujahs, as they cast their
   crowns before Him that sat upon the Throne of God. And, as the refrain
   of a song hums itself over and over, again, even after the singer has
   ceased, John, when he began to write this Book, seems to have
   remembered the chorus of those who "came out of great tribulation, and
   have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
   I think that I hear them, now, while we are listening, and this is the
   grand chorale of the skies--"Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from
   our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings and priests unto God
   and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever." We, in
   feebler strains, fervently add our, "Amen."

   Would you not wish to be in Heaven when your life on earth is over? The
   time will come when you must die--would you not desire to have a good
   hope of entering into the felicities of the perfected ones? I am sure
   you would! But if you are at last to be numbered among the redeemed
   host on high, you must learn their song here! You cannot be admitted
   into the choirs above without having practiced and rehearsed their
   music here below! Therefore you must think much and believe much
   concerning Christ's love to His chosen and how He showed it in washing
   us from our sins in His own blood. He is coming again! The next verse
   tells us, "Behold, He comes with clouds." When He shall come and earth
   shall rock and reel, and the skies shall shrivel up like worn-out
   parchment, and the stars shall fall like fig leaves from the trees--in
   that day you will wish to be found at the right hand of the King and to
   cry with rapture--"Welcome, welcome, Son of God!"

   But you cannot be there unless you first know Him as the Christ who has
   loved you and washed you from your sins in His own blood. I pray,
   therefore, that while I talk feebly enough, myself, God's Divine power
   may go with the word that you who know the Redeemer's love may know it
   better and feel your hearts swell with glad emotion till you are ready
   to stand up and shout, "Glory and majesty, dominion and power be unto
   Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood!" I
   pray, too, that others who are strangers to the blood-washing and have
   never yet known the power of Christ's atoning Sacrifice, may say, "By
   the Grace of God, we, also, will know something of that love, if it is
   to be

   known, and we will pray that in us, also, that wondrous washing may
   take place, that we, also, may be clean through Jesus' blood and stand
   among the ransomed throng to shout His praises forever and ever!"

   Notice very specially that the exile of Patmos, having known much of
   Christ and lived in His Presence for many years, sings of love as
   manifested in the washing away of sins. Some years before he had
   written, by the guidance of the Holy Spirit, those marvelous Words,
   "God is love." But now, as the end of his life approaches, all love
   seems for him to be summed up in the blood-washing. This is the climax
   and summit of the love of Christ! I delight to dwell on this glorious
   theme! They tell me of God in Nature and speak of the warbling of birds
   and the beauties of the summer as revelations of the love of God, as
   doubtless they are. I read of the matchless life of Christ and I am
   charmed with its beauties and its blessedness. But when I would speak
   of the fullness of His love, I can find nothing to express it but the
   blood which He shed on Calvary!

   It is a wonderful work which that blood-shedding accomplishes in taking
   away our sins, for they are taken away at once and forever when we
   trust in the Crucified! This is a blessed Truth of God about which the
   Word of God leaves no manner of doubt. I do not know whether, "washed,"
   is the best word to express the meaning of the text. We need something
   more than the mere removal of outside sin. If, however, this idea is to
   be kept, I prefer the word, "laved," which gives us a suitable
   expression of the thought and also carries us back to the laver used in
   the typical ordinances of the Tabernacle and Temple of old. The text
   may be read, "Unto Him that loved us and laved us from our sins in His
   own blood." If we prefer it, we may render our song as the Revised
   Version has it, with a deeper shade of meaning, "Unto Him that loves us
   and loosed us from our sins by His blood" and, with adoring hearts may
   add, "to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever." In His
   great love He laves away the defilement of our sins and then looses us
   from the chains that those sins had thrown around our life--

   "Oh, for this love, let rocks and hills

   Their lasting silence break!

   And all harmonious human tongues

   The Sa vior's praises speak."

   I shall have only two things to talk about on this occasion. First, let
   us think of the love of Jesus in the particular way mentioned in the
   text, as shown in His washing us from our sins in His own blood. And
   secondly, when we have meditated on His love, let us glorify Him for
   it. I will not attempt to take the whole of verse six--that would be
   too much for one sermon.

   I. First, LET US THINK OF THE LOVE OF JESUS and as we muse upon it, may
   the fire burn in our souls! May we be raised out of ourselves and be
   seated in the heavenlies, "because the love of God is shed abroad in
   our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us"! Our subject at
   this time is--The love of Christ as shown in His washing us from our
   sins in His own blood.

   Upon which I remark, first, that He loved us freely. That is clear if
   you reflect that He did not love us because we had no sin. If that had
   been the case, He would not have needed to have washed us in His own
   blood. He did not love us because we were righteous, because we were
   obedient, because we had neither omitted any duty nor committed any
   offense. No, but He saw us foul with sin and yet He loved us! We are
   described in Scripture, sometimes, as crimson and, again, as scarlet
   with sin. These are glaring colors and sin is a glaring, staring thing
   that must be seen. God has seen it--God abhors it! But though He saw
   it, He loved us--"Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it."
   What wondrous love it is that Christ should love a thief! Yet He did,
   and took a thief to be the first to enter His Kingdom with Him! What
   amazing condescension that Christ should love an outcast! Yet there was
   one who loved Him much, because she had been forgiven much! How
   marvelous that Christ should love a swearer! Yet He loved Peter, whose
   swearing was of the worst kind, for he denied his Master with an oath!

   'Twas passing strange that Christ should love a persecutor! Yet He
   loved Saul of Tarsus, who was exceedingly mad against His people. Is
   not this the greatest marvel of all, that He should love you and that
   He should love me--that He has loved us though we have been utterly
   unworthy of His love, full of sin and keeping to the sin, persevering
   in it, refusing to turn from it when bid to repent? I ask, again, is
   not this an amazing marvel that He should love us while we were yet
   rejecting all His love and, year after year, continuing with a high
   hand to rebel against Him? Yet He loved us while we were dead in
   trespasses and sins, loved us out of free, rich, Sovereign Grace--not
   because we were lovely, but because He is loving--not because we were
   gracious, but because He is full of Grace! You see, the text does not
   say that He washed us and loved us as if from some high sense of duty
   He took away our sin and then loved us when we were clean.

   No, it is not "washed and loved," it is, "loved and washed." The love
   is first and because He loved us in our sins and in spite of them, He
   cleanses them all away! Proclaim this glorious Gospel, all you who know
   the glad tidings! Let men and angels hear it again and again! He loved
   us while our sin was yet upon us and, therefore, He washed us and made
   us white through His own blood! It is love most freely given. When I
   think of it, I feel that I can join with the children and say--

   "Oh, if there's only one song I can sing

   When in His beauty I see the great King,

   This shall my song in eternity be--

   'Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!'" As I think of Christ's love,
   I say, next, He loved us condescendingly. He loved us "and washed us."
   Does God take to washing black sinners white? That He should create, I
   understand. That He should destroy, I also understand. But that He
   should wash and cleanse those who have made themselves foul with sin is
   marvelous! God is so full of power that if a thing is broken, it is
   never worth His while to mend it. It is the poverty of our resources
   that compels us to put up with defiled and broken things and make them
   better. But He could, with a word, or without a word, make another race
   of creatures and leave sinful men to die if He would! Yet He loved us
   so that He stooped to wash us from our defilement. Oh, when you see the
   Christ of God kneeling down, girding Himself with a towel, like a
   slave, and bringing forth the ewer and the basin. When you see Him
   pouring water on His disciples' feet, then taking foot after foot with
   His own dear hands and washing them, you see a great sight of love!

   But when He opens His own side. When He gives His hands and feet to be
   sacred fountains of blood and we are cleansed through His death and
   agony--this is compassion like a God! This is a sight the likes of
   which Heaven and earth have never seen! What love must He have to
   sinful men, that He should stoop so low as this? The Maker of Heaven
   and earth washing filthy hearts and sinful souls! It almost surpasses
   human thought, yet it is most certainly true! Glory be unto His name!
   Well may we sing praises "unto Him that loved us, and washed us." It is
   amazing mercy that Christ should ever deal with sin except to punish
   it. That He should ever take it on Himself, that He might remove it
   from us, is a thing that we shall never fully understand even in Glory,
   itself! Condescending love, indeed, it was that loved us and washed
   us--

   "On such love, my Soul, still ponder,

   Love so great, so rich, so free!

   Say, while lost in holy wonder,

   Why, O Lord, such love to me?

   Hallelujah, Grace shall reign eternally." But, next, He loved us in a
   holy manner. The love of Christ was as holy as everything else about
   Him. We do not read that He loved us and, therefore, winked at our
   sinfulness. Oh, no, that could never be! The love of Christ never
   becomes an unholy thing! It never panders to our lust, nor does it
   cover up our iniquity so that it shall not be punished. He loved us,
   but because He loved us He must wash us! He could not take us to Heaven
   unwashed. A man cannot remain a sinner and be at peace with God. Even
   the Almighty could not make us happy and let us remain in sin. You
   cannot be at rest till you are right with God and you cannot be right
   with God till you give up evil! He is a holy God and the love of
   Christ, mighty as it is, cannot bless you without washing you. You
   drunks must give up the cup. You that are dishonest must become honest.
   You that are unchaste must be rendered pure. You that are selfish must
   become loving. You that are hot-tempered must be made meek and lowly.
   It must be done! There is no other way by which you can be saved. Even
   He that loves you can only bless you thus. You must be washed! Holiness
   requires it. Oh, what a love it is that will not leave us foul, but
   loves us out of our sins! Christ "loved us and washed us." This,
   indeed, is holy love--

   "Love that condemns the sinner's sin,

   Yet, in condemning, pardon seals!

   That saves from righteous wrath, and yet,

   In saving, righteousness reveals!" Christ's love is seen, next, in that
   He loved us at a costly rate. He has washed us from our sins "in His
   own blood." Ah, Brothers and Sisters, I wish that I had a tongue that
   could speak of this wondrous work as it deserves to be spoken of, but
   human lips are slow and stammering when they approach this theme! Who
   can measure or express the love which proves itself by the outpoured
   blood of the Son of God? Yet this is the gift His love has bestowed
   upon us. By, "His own blood," I understand not merely the actual blood
   of His body, but the whole of His griefs and woes and sacrificial

   death--His giving up Himself, instead of us, to bear the righteous
   wrath of God, justly our due. It means just that. There could be no
   washing for us except He should be in a bloody sweat. There was no
   washing us unless there was--

   "A fountain filled with blood,

   Drawn from Immanuel's veins." There was no making us clean, except by
   His coming into contact with human sin--and that meant to Him what the
   fire meant to the bull on the altar. It meant being burnt up with a
   Divine wrath on account of human sin--wrath most just, most true--for
   God cannot bear iniquity! It is not right that He should do otherwise
   than hate it with all the infinite hate of His righteous soul. Christ
   has washed us "in His own blood."

   The priests could only cleanse with blood of bulls and goats, but He
   has washed us from our sins "in His own blood." Men are willing enough
   to shed the blood of others. How readily they will enter war! But
   Christ was willing to shed His own blood, to pour out His soul unto
   death that we might be saved! No language can ever fully set forth this
   marvelous mystery--and as the mighty master of painting threw a veil
   over a face that he could never depict, so would I leave unspoken the
   great marvel of Christ's washing us with His own blood! But let us, who
   know it to be true in our own experience, lift a glad song in our
   hearts--

   "To Him that loved the souls of men,

   And washed us in His blood.

   To royal honors raised our head,

   And made us priests to God."

   We cannot meditate on the love of Christ without saying that He loved
   us effectually. The text says that Christ "loved us, and washed us from
   our sins," or, "loosed us from our sins." You that believe in Christ
   are washed from all your sins! There is no sin remaining upon you now
   in the matter of guilt before God. "Who is He that condemns? It is
   Christ that died." You are justified, through Christ, from every sin!
   You are clean every whit if you have believed in Him. "There is
   therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." But
   we can go further than this and join with the saints in Heaven in
   saying--"He has loosed us from our sins"--that is, from the dominion of
   sin. When Christ pardons sin He kills it, He crucifies it--and
   crucifixion, you know, means death. But it is a lingering death and a
   crucified man lives in pain, without power to work or act--he suffers
   and lingers.

   So is it with sin in the Believer. It is nailed up, crucified with
   Christ. You cannot do now what your evil nature suggests to you. A
   respectable man whom I know said that the other night he was driving
   along with his old horse. Another man came through the fog and their
   horses touched each other. "But," he said, "we passed very civilly."
   But there came along one who looked like a gentleman, driving rather
   fast. He drove into the poor man's cart and, instead of making any
   apology, he cut him across the face with his whip. My friend is a
   decided Christian, yet he said, "I felt that the old man was in me, and
   I wanted to give him a cut of my whip in return, but I did not. When I
   got home I said, 'The old man is not dead.' If he had been dead, I
   should not have felt even a momentary passion. I kept him down, but I
   felt very angry, and I said to myself, 'Ah, though you have been a
   Christian a great many years, the old man is still alive.'"

   So he is in every one of us. He lies like a sneak in the corner, but
   the day shall come when there shall be no remains of the evil, no trace
   of sin left in us, and in Heaven we shall sing, "He has loosed us from
   our sins in His own blood. He has taken the last relic of sin
   away--every tendency to evil, every possibility of evil," for it is
   written, "They are without fault before the Throne of God," and no sin
   shall ever come into their hearts again! Glory be to His name that such
   a sanctification as this is possible and that we shall yet have to sing
   of it as perfected! Praise to His holy name for the love which ends in
   such bliss! Hallelujah! He looses us from the chains of sin that He may
   bind us with the bonds of love! This is royal liberty."--

   "Drawn by such cords, we onward move,

   Till round Your Throne we meet,

   And, captives in the chains of love,

   Embrace our Conqueror's feet." Once more, this love of Christ is
   perpetual--He loves us still. Turning to the Revised Version we do not
   read, "Unto Him that loved us," but, "unto Him that loves us." I like
   that. Jesus loves me still! He did not finish His love by His death. He
   loves you still! When He was poor on earth and despised and rejected of
   men, He loved you. And now that a royal diadem adorns His blessed brow
   and all angels fall down and worship Him, He loves you still and He
   will always love you. You who believe in Him are His pride, His
   Hephzibah, His delight is in you. You can hardly love yourself, can

   you? When you see your own face in the glass of God's Law, is there any
   beauty there? Did you ever stand and spiritually admire yourself? If
   you did, you were a fool! If you truly know your own heart, you cannot
   find, there, anything to delight in. You blush. You hide your face for
   shame. But Christ loves you. "I am black," said the spouse. She felt
   that she was very black, but when she looked to her Beloved and saw
   what He thought of her, she added, "but comely."

   And we can appropriate her language. In myself, "as the tents of Kedar,
   smoke-dried by the Bedouin, yet am I by Grace as the curtains of
   Solomon, bedight with gold lace and all the embroidery of the workman's
   needle! I am both--to myself a thing undone, but in Him washed and
   saved! Unlovely, but by Him, beloved." Oh, it makes my heart race
   within me! I feel as if I could leap into Heaven when I think, "He
   loves me! He loves me! He loved me when He died for me. He lives for me
   and He loves me still."--

   "Now though He reigns exalted high,

   His love is still as great.

   Well He remembers Calvary,

   Nor let His saints forget."

   If you feel as I do, you will go with me into the other part of the
   subject--"To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."

   II. So, in the second place, LET US GLORIFY THIS LOVING, LIVING SAVIOR.
   If we were to do it fitly, we should need to have music such as Handel
   wrote. And when we would sing of it, if we all of us had perfect
   voices, we should go home and say, "Ah, it was poor praise compared
   with what He deserves." So we will not try any singing, but will talk
   about something practical.

   If we are to glorify Christ, we must gladly confess His name. If you
   have never acknowledged Him and confessed Him, begin now, and say,
   "Unto Him that loved me, and washed me from my sins in His own blood;
   to Him be glory." If you really mean that, you are bound to come out
   and acknowledge that you are His disciple. You cannot say, "To Him be
   glory," and then hide yourself away and never seek to bring glory to
   His name by openly declaring that He is your Lord and Master. Some of
   you are very much like a mouse behind the wall. You are in the Lord's
   house, but you are not known as one of the family--sometimes you give a
   little squeak in your hiding place--and sometimes come out at night, as
   the mouse does, to pick up a crumb or two, without being seen. Is this
   worthy of yourself? Is it worthy of your Lord and Master?

   You are a Christian, you say, but you do not want to be known to be a
   Christian. A soldier in the Lord's army, but you never put on your
   uniform! You like to always be in civilian clothes. You are afraid lest
   anybody should know that you are a soldier! If a man behaved like that
   in the British army, they would drum him out of the regiment! What
   would be the good of such a fellow? If he is ashamed of Her Majesty's
   uniform, let him be gone. He is not loyal to his sovereign. I am not
   going to condemn you who have never come out and acknowledged
   yourselves followers of Christ--I wish that you would hold a little
   court and condemn yourself--and then, instead of my drumming you out,
   you would drum yourself out and say, "I will not stay any longer in a
   position where I can be talked to like that. Glory be to Him who has
   loved me and washed me in His own blood! I will openly confess Him. I
   will unite myself with His people. I will say, 'I am His and He is
   mine.'"

   Remember that there is no salvation promised to an unconfessed faith. I
   boldly put it according to the Word of God. "If you shall confess with
   your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has
   raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved." There is no question
   that confession is here required. And again it is clearly stated, "He
   that believes and is baptized"--which is the confession that Christ
   requires--"shall be saved." And though confession with the mouth and
   baptism cannot save, yet the faith to which the promise is made is a
   faith that dares to confess and come out!

   "Then, I should have to bear a lot of ridicule," says one. And are you
   afraid to follow your Master for fear of ridicule? Remember what, for
   love of you, He bore! Think what scorn from the Pharisees and hatred
   and malice from the rulers of the Jews, Christ cheerfully accepted that
   He might save you! He shirked not the heavy Cross for you--will you not
   take that little cross for Him? He shed His blood to cleanse you, but
   it is not likely that you will ever be called to shed your blood for
   Him--yet many have done this and counted it all gladness! Oh, by the
   martyrs who dared to die for Jesus--three of them on this very spot
   where we are now meeting, many of them across the water in
   Smithfield--I beseech you, if you love Him that loved you and washed
   you from your sins in His own blood, to give Him at least the glory
   which would come of a confession that you are saved by Him--

   "It passes telling, that dear love of Yours, My Jesus, Savior. Yet
   these lips of mine

   Would gladly proclaim to sinners, far and near, A love which can remove
   all guilty fear, And love beget."

   Next, if we really do wish to glorify Him, we must shun all sin. A man
   cannot say, "Unto Him that loved me, and washed me from my sins be
   glory," and then go off to the ale-bench and drink with the drunkard.
   You dare not say, "Unto Him be glory," and then, as a professed
   Christian, go and do a dishonest deed, or speak a lie, or do that which
   would be discreditable to yourself and would bring dishonor to His dear
   name! If He washed me from my sin with His blood, I must hate sin. It
   murdered my Lord. It cost Him His life to save me from it. How, then,
   can I--how dare I--toy with it? How shall we, that are dead to sin,
   live any longer therein? How shall we that are washed in His blood, go
   and stain our garments, again, and play with iniquity and trifle with
   transgression? Remember that you are "loosed" from sin. It no longer
   holds you captive--the chains are dissolved by the blood of Atonement.
   Why, then, should you go about as if you were in bondage? We shall
   never have done with sin while we are here, but that is no reason why
   we should be defiled by it, for the Fountain wherein we were first
   washed is always open! As the spring of love never ceases to flow, so
   the efficacy of the blood is never lost. "The blood of Jesus Christ His
   Son cleanses us from all sin." Since death has no more dominion over
   Christ, sin need have no more dominion over us. "It is written, Be you
   holy, for I am holy," and I beseech you to obey the exhortation, for
   then, and then only, will you bring glory to Him who washed you from
   your sins in His own blood--

   "Blest be your love, dear Lord, That taught us this sweet way, Only to
   love You for Yourself, And for that love obey."

   Again, if we truly say, "To Him be glory and dominion," then we must
   give Him dominion over ourselves. Each man is a little empire of three
   kingdoms--body, soul and spirit--and it should be a united kingdom.
   Make Christ King of it all! Do not allow any branch of those three
   kingdoms to set up for itself a distinct rule--put them all under the
   sway of your one King. My eyes must not look on vanity; my tongue must
   not talk uncleanness; my hands must not minister to evil; my feet must
   not carry me where I should not go; my heart must not wander; my
   thoughts must not go astray; my imagination must not find pleasure in
   evil. Every faculty of my nature ought to be given "unto Him that loved
   us, and washed us from our sins." Every ability and possibility, every
   growth and progress made in knowledge and learning, must be laid at
   Jesus' feet. Say, "To Him be glory and dominion," and then make a full
   surrender of yourself to His sway.

   So many in these days seem only to want the salvation of Christ without
   the Christ who gives the salvation. Both go together. He must be Lord
   of the forgiven soul. He only washes those who will enter His Kingdom
   and come under His government. Are we not glad to proclaim Him King?
   Reign, blessed Jesus, reign! Reign over my body, soul and spirit--
   completely reign. Bring every thought into captivity to Your holy love!
   Is not that what you are now saying, you that have been washed in His
   blood?--

   "Lord, You have won. At last I yield! My heart, by mighty Grace
   compelled, Surrenders all to You. Against Your terrors long I strove,
   But who can stand against Your love? Love conquers even me."

   And then, next, if we say, "To Him be glory and dominion," we must seek
   to bring others under His sway. There is some way in which every one of
   us can do it. Dear Brothers and Sisters, if you have yielded yourselves
   to Christ, do not be satisfied till you see your children saved! Begin
   at home! Do not be content till the boys and girls all belong to
   Christ. Then look after your neighbors. You that are large employers,
   care for the men who work for you. Do not treat them as "hands"--look
   at them as souls and regard them as beings made in God's image and for
   His praise. Not only talk, but act! When they are in need, help them.
   Succor them that you may, by any means, draw them to think of their
   souls and to desire and pray that they, also, may be washed from their
   sins in Christ's own blood. O Beloved, if He is to have dominion, let
   us, each one, win a little bit for Him! You cannot convert idolatrous
   China, or heathen India, or the dark continent of Africa. These big
   things are too much for any one of us, but there is a little kingdom
   for each one of us to win for

   Christ, a little bit committed to us, that we may go and conquer it and
   fulfill the desire expressed in the text--"To Him be glory and
   dominion."

   Watch for souls. Be on the lookout for new ways of serving the Master.
   As African travelers now seem very eager to be the first to make a
   treaty with certain chieftains, that their territory may be annexed to
   this kingdom or that, so seek to win new conquests for Christ and
   attach people to His cause before they are hopelessly lost to the
   devil! Perhaps the friend sitting next to you at this service does not
   yet know the Lord. Could you not have a word with that person before
   you leave the building? Perhaps, through your message, that heart will
   be won for Christ!

   If we really wish that Christ should have glory and dominion because He
   has washed us from our sins in His blood, we must do nothing to
   dishonor Him--and we shall do anything sooner than see His blessed
   Gospel and His holy name dishonored by others. Oh, I would sooner be
   accounted as the offscouring of all things than have any part with
   those who reject or dim the Gospel of my Lord and Master! I would
   sooner be accounted the greatest bigot on earth, or the most stupid
   fool that ever breathed, than enter into any partnership or brotherhood
   with those who keep back the Cross of Christ, or cast a slur upon the
   Inspiration of holy Scripture! Shall I, who am washed from my sin in
   the blood of Christ, have any fellowship with those who speak of this
   highest exhibition of my Lord's love as "the doctrine of the shambles"?
   Or with one who "has counted the Blood of the Covenant, with which he
   was sanctified, an unholy thing"? This were a poor return for the love
   that bled and died to save me--any dishonor is better than that.

   When Queen Elizabeth came to a miry place in one of her progresses, you
   remember how Sir Walter Raleigh, without a moment's thought, took off
   his new cloak, which had cost him much, and spread it in the way, so
   that Her Majesty might walk over it. Have I any honor? Have I any
   reputation? Have I any name? I will throw it down! Let it go on the
   miry place that my Lord may tread on it and no mire may come on Him!
   May we all, who know that we are loosed from our sins, get into just
   that spirit which, whenever men are finding fault with the Gospel, will
   say, "Here, find fault with me! Turn all your attention to me--only
   spare my Lord." Christ is set in the pillory and men are pelting Him.
   He is the true lover of Christ who comes up to the pillory and stands
   in front of Him, ready to take the blows aimed at his Lord.

   He is the true lover of Christ who drinks in so much of the Character
   of Christ that he can truly use that language which is first employed
   with reference to the zeal of Christ, Himself--"The reproaches of them
   that reproached you are fallen upon Me." He is not honored whom men
   honor. He is honored who is made a laughingstock for Christ's sake.
   "Blessed are you when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
   shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice,
   and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in Heaven." Get this
   spirit into you--"Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins,
   be glory and dominion."

   "There," said a dying man, who was in a ditch when the great Emperor
   Napoleon rode by and he heard a shout of victory, "let me die--the
   Emperor has conquered." And oh, may not you and I be well content to be
   blotted out and forgotten, so long as Christ the King shall come to His
   own, again? He soon shall triumph! With the ear of faith you may almost
   hear His chariot wheels. He comes! He comes quickly and happy shall he
   be in that day who now has been despised lest Christ should be
   dishonored! With what joy shall we meet our Lord when He takes to
   Himself His great power and reigns! With what rapture shall we fall at
   His feet if we have been true to Him and to His Truth! For His love is
   founded on His Truth and triumphs through it.

   I am done when I have added this one thing more. Unto Him that loved
   and washed us, let us give all glory and dominion. But if we would do
   that, we must not be cold and indifferent about holy things. You know
   what kind of hearers some people are. You may say what you will to
   them, but they are never moved. I believe that if a half-hundred-weight
   of dynamite were put under the seat, it would hardly move them. They
   are so solid, so cold. Can I hear of that dear name, and never catch
   the sacred fire? Can I think of Calvary and still my heart remain cold
   and chill? Can I behold that marred face, that, "sacred head once
   wounded," and my soul not thrill with gratitude? Can I see those cruel
   nails and that terrible crown of thorns--can I taste the vinegar and
   handle the sponge--and yet never feel one warm affection within my
   spirit? God forbid! Oh, my Savior, let my heart rejoice or ache, but
   let it not be hard and cold! Let me adore You with every power of my
   redeemed manhood all aglow with holy fervor."--

   "But ah, how faint our praises rise! Sure, 'tis the wonder of the skies
   That we, who share His richest love, So cold and unconcerned should
   prove."

   Surely, if "we have known and believed the love that God has to us," we
   shall find some answering spark of affection to Him in our hearts! If
   we mean to give Him the glory and dominion, we must give Him our love
   and devotion. Our love must always be as the echo to His. It cannot be
   that we can receive such abounding, overflowing bounty, and remain
   indifferent to the Giver! His interests must surely be our chief
   concern. We must be moved to seek first the things which concern Him
   who has bestowed on us such wonderful Grace. Wake up, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, if you are getting into a cold state!

   Some religion seems to be altogether a matter of the drum--that will
   not do. But there are occasions when the drum may rightly be used.
   There are seasons when the cornet, harp, dulcimer and all kinds of
   music ought to be heard. There are times for the holy dance and the
   joyous song. There are periods when enthusiasm must rule the hour, when
   the spirit must feel that she is all wings, that she mounts and
   soars--and whether in the body or out of the body, she cannot tell. May
   such a moment as that be yours just now! Blessed be the name of the
   Lord forever! To Him be glory and dominion! Hallelujah! Let us all say
   it. Let us all feel it. Let us all live it. Amen, and Amen!

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Isaiah 53.
     __________________________________________________________________

An Urgent Request for an Immediate Answer

   (No. 2231)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORDS-DAY EVENING, MAY
   10, 1891.

   "And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and
   if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
   Genesis 24:49.

   THE chapter from which the text is taken bristles with points. There is
   a remarkable parallel between Eliezer seeking a wife for Isaac and the
   ministers of Christ seeking souls for Jesus. It is something more than
   an allegory. It is really a very instructive parable of how we are to
   deal for our Master with the souls of men and women. For as truly as
   Abraham sent his servant to seek a bride for his son, we are
   commissioned to search for those who shall be brought into the Church,
   and at last, as the bride of Christ, sit down at the marriage feast in
   the Glory Land above!

   You will notice how Eliezer prayed all along the way. He had no doubt
   in his mind as to whether God interfered in human affairs, but boldly
   and simply sought to know His will. Then, having presented his
   petition, we find him in quiet confidence holding his peace, "to wit
   whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not." And when
   success crowned his efforts, he was forward to acknowledge that the
   speedy fulfillment of his objective was in answer to his supplication.
   It was the guidance of God and not his own acuteness or wisdom, which
   led to such a favorable issue. Thus it is also with every true minister
   of the New Testament. Oh, if we do not pray for you, my dear Hearers,
   our preaching to you will be hypocrisy! We shall never speak to men for
   God with any power of persuasion unless, first, we speak to God for men
   with power of supplication! Not without many a prayer and many a
   heaving of my heart in sighs have I come here to speak to you tonight.
   I believe that I am sent to find out some appointed for Christ in the
   Divine purpose and Covenant and I pray my Master that there may be many
   such!

   While this trusty servant thus prayed to his master's God, see how
   loyal he was to his master. He evidently realized that he was not on
   his own errand, but was the chosen instrument to do his lord's will.
   The phrase, "my master," is the refrain of this chapter. The word,
   "master," occurs 22 times. Eliezer did not aspire to any independence
   of Abraham, or of Abraham's son. His thoughts were of his master--his
   words were in praise of his master--his deeds on behalf of his master.
   He was not his own, but the bond-servant of another. This is also our
   position. Woe to the minister who loses sight of the true relationship
   between himself and his Lord, or who begins to think of serving his own
   interests rather than that of Him who called and sent him! My Brothers
   and Sisters, we are not our own, but the slaves of Christ! May our
   hearts be always kept loyal to Him! May our lips constantly speak His
   praise! May our lives always witness to our devotion to our Lord!
   Nothing we have is our own--all is His--and His absolute ownership of
   us and ours is our highest delight!

   George Herbert speaks of the "Oriental fragrance" which dwells in the
   words, "My Master." It is, indeed, a name full of sweet savor and holy
   gladness. Even here it is Heaven to serve Him! But what will it be to
   see His face, when His bride is brought safely home?--

   "O Jesus, You have promised To all who follow Thee That where You are
   in Glory, There shall Your servant be! And Jesus, I have promised To
   serve You to the end. Oh, give me Grace to follow,

   My Master and my Friend."

   See how alert Eliezer was to seize the opportunity of obeying his
   master's orders. His love to Abraham made him quick to carry out the
   commission with which he was charged. When Rebekah came to the well, he
   began the conversation in the same way as the Lord Jesus, long
   afterwards, at Jacob's well, began to talk to the woman of Samaria. He
   asked her to give him a drink. The two scenes by the well might almost
   form companion pictures. Then he very skillfully found out her name and
   was invited to her father's house as a guest. I always feel a special
   joy when I hear of the visit of a servant of God to a house being the
   means of winning some member of the household for his Master! We should
   always aim to make our visits a blessing to those with whom we visit.
   It speaks much for the consistent life of the man who is enabled to do
   so. If we realize that we are always on our Master's service, we shall
   bear a good testimony before those with whom we come in contact, making
   it quite clear that we watch for souls as those that must give
   account--that we may do it with joy--and not with grief.

   One other thing in this man is noteworthy. He meant business and went
   with unerring aim straight to the mark. He had not many purposes, but
   only one. He did not go there for anything else but to find a wife for
   Isaac. And when he got into pretty comfortable quarters and had been
   called, by Laban, "the blessed of the Lord," he was not satisfied. He
   meant business and would not even eat the meat set before him until he
   had explained his errand. Like every true servant of Christ, he put his
   Master's business before his own ease or comfort--even before the
   question of necessary food. When a man begins to think more of his
   eating than of doing the will of God, he ceases to be a true-hearted
   minister! Let us imitate the thoroughness of Abraham's servant in this
   matter. He told Bethuel and Laban what he came for and, before he
   finished his address, he turned to them and said distinctly, "Now, what
   answer do you mean to give to my master's message? I cannot be kept in
   suspense. If you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me.
   And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the
   left."

   I. Notice, first, that HE STATED HIS CASE. You must not expect men to
   come to a decision upon a matter which has not been laid before them.
   Our good young Brother who goes into the pulpit and cries, "Believe,
   believe," but does not tell his hearers what is to be believed, has not
   accomplished much! You cannot ask people to buy if you have no goods to
   show them. But Eliezer opened his pack, exposed his wares and sought,
   at once, to do business on his master's account. What did he say to his
   interested listeners?

   To begin with, he told them that his master was great and gave them
   some idea how rich he was, for he went over the list of his
   possessions--his flocks and herds, his silver and gold, his camels and
   asses, his menservants and maidservants. Thus did he commend his
   master, as I would also seek to commend mine. Language fails me to
   speak of His greatness! This world is His and all the worlds that He
   has made. "The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says the Lord of
   Hosts." He lays claim to all things in the earth, animate and
   inanimate. "Every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a
   thousand hills." None other can be mentioned beside Him. "Who has
   measured the waters in the hollow of His hand and meted out Heaven with
   the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and
   weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?" So great
   is He that all other things are small compared with Him. "Behold, the
   nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of
   the balance: behold, He takes up the isles as every little thing." Is
   He not a glorious Master to serve? "How great is His goodness and how
   great is His beauty!"

   Having first spoken of his master, he told them that his master's son
   was his heir. That was a very important point in the business. And he
   spoke about how his master had put all that he had into the hands of
   his son--that the promises were his and that the inheritance would come
   to him. He called the son, "master," equally with the father. I also
   desire to glorify God and to magnify Christ Jesus, His Only-Begotten
   and Well-Beloved Son. It is the Father's will "that all men should
   honor the Son, even as they honor the Father." He is His Father's
   heir--He claimed the title in His parable of the wicked husbandmen.
   When we come on our Master's business, we seek those who shall become
   "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ."

   This is the third point with Eliezer--he wanted one who would leave her
   home and go and be one with his master's son. He said that his master's
   son needed a wife and he had come to seek one for him. He needed one
   who would be willing to go on a long and venturous journey and be a
   pilgrim in a strange land with her husband. He would have no other than
   one who would give herself up to the God of Israel and take a full
   share with Isaac in the Covenant blessing. Well, now, that is my case,
   too. The Lord God, the Creator of Heaven and earth, has all manner of
   good things to bestow upon the

   sinful sons of men. There is no measuring the Grace and love of God and
   He would have you to be His people that He may be your God. He wants
   those who will be willing to leave all and be united to His
   Only-Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus, who for our salvation came down from
   Heaven and took our nature, and lived in it--who took our sin and died
   for us--that we might be pardoned and forever saved. The Son must see
   of the travail of His soul. There must be souls that shall be eternally
   saved through believing on Him. He cannot die in vain! He must have a
   people who shall be to Him a bride, with whom He shall delight Himself
   forever and ever. And the question is, are there any such here? Are
   there any here who will yield themselves to His sweet love, who will
   trust themselves with Him, as Rebekah trusted herself with Isaac--who
   will come out of the world--and live the separated life with Him? This
   is the errand on which we have come.

   And Eliezer added that he hoped that he had found the right person. He
   believed that it was Rebekah, for he had put it before God in
   prayer--and in answer to his prayer she had come. She had done exactly
   as he had laid it down in prayer that she should do. Now, I have a hope
   dancing in my heart that I have, on this occasion, found the right
   person. I often wonder why some people are here. There has come into
   the Tabernacle on the Lord's-Day, many a time, a runaway from his
   father's house in the country. He has come to London to sin and he has
   little thought that he came to London to be saved--but here the Word of
   God has laid hold upon him! There has dropped in here a sailor who had
   only been a day or two in port, and the last thing that he ever thought
   was that he should be converted! But here he came and found eternal
   life! Your coming here in such numbers and your eyes, as you look at
   me, encourage me, while your willingness to hear what I have to say
   inspires me to fearlessly deliver my Master's message! Surely God means
   to bless you! If He gives the hearing ear, will He not give the broken
   heart? And if He has led you to be anxious to listen to my message, are
   you not, many of you, the very persons whom He has appointed to be
   forever united to His beloved Son?

   The case being thus faithfully stated by Eliezer, he now pressed for a
   reply. "If you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If
   Rebekah will go with me to be the wife of Isaac, tell me." So I put it
   to you. If you are willing to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and are
   ready to leave the world and all its temptations and come to Him, say
   so! Tell me. Let us know if you have now come to a turning point. You
   remember how the Roman ambassadors demanded of some who came to them
   that they should, on the spot, decide whether they meant war with Rome
   or submission to it? When they asked for time, the ambassadors drew a
   circle round them, and said, "Before you exit that circle, you must
   settle whether it is to be peace or war." I would draw, here, a circle
   round some of you and say, "Your portion must be either salvation or
   damnation. You have already been hesitating and halting too long. Do
   not leave that seat till you have decided, one way or the other."

   There is, just under the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, a spot which I
   once had pointed out to me--it must have been 40 years ago--where a
   workman, busily engaged at the top of the dome, fell, and, of course,
   was dashed to pieces on the floor. And I saw the mark of his chisel on
   the place where he was killed. I wonder whether there are any marks in
   these pews where souls were lost, where some have parleyed with God,
   refused His Grace, resisted His Spirit and gone thenceforth the
   downward road? I would to God that, instead thereof, there might be
   some mark where the Grace of God has worked effectual salvation! I
   believe there is not a single pew or seat in the aisles in this place,
   that might not legitimately be marked as a place where souls have been
   saved, for, time out of mind, when friends come here and speak on
   Monday nights, you must have noticed how one of them says, "The third
   seat from that pillar over yonder was the place where I sat when the
   Light of God came." And another says, "Christ found me in a back seat
   in the top gallery," and so on, until they have pointed to almost every
   part of the building as the place where God has called someone by His
   Grace! I hope that some of you are now sitting in the very spot where
   you are predestinated to be born again unto everlasting life!

   II. In the second place, it is clearly set before us, that when Eliezer
   had stated his case, HE WISHED TO HAVE A FAVORABLE REPLY. I might
   almost say he expected it. After his wonderful guidance and his
   hospitable reception, his hopes would rise high that his quest would be
   speedily brought to a satisfactory end.

   If a favorable reply was given to him, it would enable him to execute
   his errand. Whereas, if the answer was against him, he could not, then,
   carry out his master's orders. If no soul gets saved through this
   discourse, I cannot carry on my business. "Oh, well," says one, "a man
   may preach very faithfully and yet he may have no souls saved." Yes, a
   fisherman may fish and never catch any fish, but he is not much of a
   fisherman, and so, if there were no souls saved, perhaps I might find
   some way of satisfying my conscience, but it is unknown to me as yet! I
   have never sought such a solace and hope I never shall. With me it is,
   "Give me children, or else I die." If you are not saved and brought to
   Christ, I feel as if I must

   give up my work of preaching to you. I cannot stand here beating the
   air. If my hearers are not converted, I have lost my time--I have lost
   the exercise of brain and heart! I feel as if I had lost my hope and
   lost my life unless I find for my Lord some of His blood-bought
   ones--and I must find some of them by this sermon!

   I think that Eliezer longed for a favorable reply because it would be
   an answer to his prayer. Possibly you have not prayed for yourself, but
   we have prayed for you--not that we know your name, or your case--but
   we have often gone over in secret a case just like yours, and we can
   say that we have brought you before God in earnest supplication. And
   perhaps there are godly people at home who are praying that as you are
   here, you may get a blessing. I frequently see people who come to join
   the Church and they say, "My husband is not converted," or, "My
   daughter is not converted." "Do you get them to come and hear the
   Word?" I ask. "Oh, yes, Sir, they come and hear!" "Well," I have said,
   "if you get them into the battle, where the shots are flying, they are
   very likely to be wounded." So we have often prayed that when some of
   you have been persuaded to come and hear the Word of God, the Spirit of
   God may get hold of you and that you may fall wounded beneath His sharp
   sword, or receive an arrow between the joints of the harness!

   The principal reason, however, why this good man wanted to find a
   willing response about Rebekah was because it would gladden his
   master's son. "Oh," he thought, "what joy I shall give him if I take
   back to him the right woman, the wife whom God has appointed for him!
   He has lost his mother, Sarah, and he is pining and grieving. But if I
   can take him back one who will fill her place in his tender heart, I
   shall rejoice." As for us, our one business is to make glad the heart
   of Christ! His heart was pierced with a spear after having been broken
   with great anguish--and there is nothing that will refresh Him like a
   soul yielding itself to His care. Who will do that here? Are there any
   in this house who are now saying, "I will belong to Christ from this
   time forth. I will trust Him, for He loved me, and gave Himself for
   me"? Happy messenger, to stand here and tell His story, and to say, "My
   Lord is waiting for you in the far country. He has sent me to invite
   you to share with Him all that He has! If your heart is willing to take
   Him, He gives Himself to you."

   His only complaint is, "You will not come unto Me that you might have
   life." And His declaration is, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise
   cast out." Any, "him" that comes to Him, He will receive and bless!
   Eliezer was quite sure his master would deal tenderly and truly with
   Rebekah, therefore he asked her father and brother to "deal kindly and
   truly" with him. I am quite sure that my Master will deal "kindly and
   truly" with you--He could not do otherwise! If you but knew His heart,
   or had a glimpse of His beauty, you would hesitate no longer. Will you
   not give Him a favorable answer, and say, "Yes, we will deal kindly and
   truly with your Master, and will yield our hearts to Him at once and
   forever"?

   I think, too, that Eliezer had begun to feel that it would be for
   Rebekah's benefit to go to his master. He had seen her face at the
   well. He liked the style of the young woman and he thought, "If I can
   get her for Isaac, she will be settled in life; she will be the
   mistress and queen of a great household; she will have a happy husband
   and all that her heart can desire." As I think of some here who have
   never found peace, I say to myself that if I could only get you to
   Christ, how happy you would be! If you would come and trust Him, your
   everlasting fortune would be made. If you would yield yourselves to
   Him, there would be an end of sin, an end of doubt, an end of fear and
   an end of terror. You would be saved! Your morality, which is now so
   precarious, would rise into a solid spirituality, for you would be made
   holy through the indwelling Spirit. Seeing that this would be the case,
   could I do you a better turn than to lead you to Jesus?

   John B. Gough tells a story of how he was fetched from a railway
   station to speak. one night, and the cab that was sent for him had a
   broken window. He noticed that the man who came in the cab put a
   handkerchief over his head as he sat close up against the hole in the
   window--and then he observed that he put his head against the window.
   Mr. Gough said, "Have you a cold in your head?" "No," he said, "but
   there is a nasty hole in this pane of glass and I am afraid that you
   may take cold. I am sticking my head into the hole to shield you, for
   you taught me to be a man and a Christian." Such gratitude as that was
   most touching--and if we can bring any to Christ, I am sure they will
   be very grateful to us. If we can lead them to Jesus, they will feel as
   if they could not do too much for us. therefore out of love to them,
   having so many who are now our dear children in Christ, we would plead
   with them, and say, "Give us a good answer and say 'Yes' to the
   overture of our Master's Son."

   III. But now the point of the text is that HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE AN
   ANSWER. He says, "If you will deal kindly and truly with my master,
   tell me: and if not, tell me." He would have their answer, whether it
   was, "Yes," or, "No." "If not, tell me." May I ask that everyone here
   will say, "Yes," or, "No," to the invitation to give himself up

   to Christ? If you will do so, say, "I will." If you will not do so, say
   deliberately, "I will not." I wish I could get hold of an undecided man
   and, taking his hand, could say to him, "Now, you must tell me which it
   will be." I can imagine some of you would say, "Oh, give me time to
   consider!" and I would reply, "You have had time to consider. Your hair
   is getting gray." In spite of all our entreaties, people say, "Oh, but
   I do not like to decide so suddenly!" If I asked you whether you would
   be honest, I hope that you would not take many minutes to answer that!
   Why, then, should you hesitate so long in giving your adherence to
   Christ? I am like Abraham's servant--I must have an answer!

   But can we rightly press men to decide if we fear that they will
   answer, "No"? I think we may, because, from the nature of the case, no
   answer means a denial. How many of our hearers have thus, for years,
   turned their back upon Christ by the simple method of giving no answer
   at all? "We hear what you say, Sir," they murmur, "and thank you for
   saying it," but, nevertheless, they go out and go on their way--and
   forget what manner of men they are! Such a response is a refusal--and
   it is none the less a refusal because you will probably retort, "But I
   did not say, 'No,' Sir. Indeed, one of these days I may, perhaps, say,
   'Yes.'" But, meanwhile, you reject the proposal and refuse to give
   yourself up to the Lord! The question is, Will you believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ? The absence of an affirmative answer means, "No, I will
   not." I am sure that it does in every case. No argument can be raised
   about that.

   But if you will answer me, "No, I will not have Christ. I will not
   believe on Him. I will not become a Christian. I will not leave my old
   ways--I mean to go on in them," well, I thank you for the answer,
   pained as I am, because now we can talk it over! This is better than no
   response, for now we have something to work upon. An ill answer can be
   considered, while no answer baffles all our efforts to help you! It is
   far more hopeful to encounter opposition than to meet with
   indifference. It is a great thing, when a ship is at sea, for the
   captain to know whereabouts he is--and when we meet with those who
   distinctly reject Christ--we at once know our bearings. If you say,
   "No, I am not a Christian and I do not want to be," so far you are
   honest and I need you, now, to think it over.

   Would you like to die in this frame of mind? You may die where you are
   sitting! Are you wise to come to this determination? Do you think that
   this is a resolution which you can justify before the judgement bar of
   God? You will certainly have to appear there! After death you will rise
   again when the trumpet of the archangel sounds and, as surely as you
   are here, you will have to stand before the Great White Throne whereon
   Christ will sit as Judge! How will the resolution which you have now
   made stand the light of that tremendous Day? I pray you, think of it,
   and I hope that you will alter your decision as many another man has
   done when he has calmly considered the magnitude of the issues at stake
   and the awful result which must come of rejecting Him who is now the
   Savior, but who will one day sit as the Judge!

   But we are the more determined to press you for some decision because
   an ill answer will set us free to go to others. You see, Eliezer says,
   "If not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
   Do not suppose that if you refuse Christ, He will lose the effect of
   His death! "He shall see of the travail of His soul and shall be
   satisfied." If you will not come unto Him, others will. If you reject
   Him, He has a people who will accept Him, by His almighty Grace. O
   Sirs, if you that hear the Gospel will not have my Master, we will go
   and bring in the publicans and harlots--and they shall enter the
   Kingdom of Heaven before you! Sons of pious parents, children of Sunday
   schools, if you believe not, you shall be cast into "outer darkness"
   where shall be "weeping and gnashing of teeth"--while the people whom
   you despise-- infidels and profligates, the very scum of society, shall
   accept the Savior and live!

   Oh, I charge you, think not that your refusal of the Gospel invitation
   will leave any gaps in the ranks of the redeemed! Our Savior, in His
   parable of the marriage of the king's son, foretold what will happen.
   The king said to his servants, "The wedding is ready, but they which
   were bidden were not worthy. Go you, therefore, into the highways and
   as many as you shall find, bid to the marriage. So those servants went
   out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found,
   both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests." But I
   would urge you to yield yourself unto the Lord, that you may be found
   at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Do not trifle with eternal matters!
   If you want to play the fool, do it with counters or with pebbles, but
   not with your soul that shall live forever in bliss or in woe!

   My importunity with you is strengthened when I think that, perhaps, if
   you give me the answer straight out, "No, I am not a Christian and I do
   not mean to be one," you may, in saying it, see more clearly what a
   terrible decision you have arrived at. An ill answer may startle you
   and ultimately lead you to repent of your folly and reverse your
   decision! If you would write down--"I am not a Christian and I never
   mean to be one," it might startle you still more. I challenge you to

   do so! And when it is written, put it over the mantelpiece and look at
   it. It will be far better to do that, horrible as it is, than to
   continue in this state of wicked suspense, indifferent as to whether
   you are lost or saved, undecided whether you are for Christ or against
   Him and yet, in your heart of hearts, dead in trespasses and sins! In
   this very place, I once urged those who were undecided to go home and
   write down, either the word, "Saved," or, "Lost," and sign their name
   to the paper. One man, when he got into his house, asked for pen and
   paper. And when his wife enquired why he wanted it, he said he was
   going to do what the parson said and write down, "Lost." She refused to
   fetch him the paper if he was going to do that.

   So he got it himself and put down a capital L. At that time his little
   girl climbed up in the chair behind him and said, "No, father, you
   shan't do that! I'd rather die than you should do that"--and the
   child's tears fell on his hand as she spoke. What my sermon had failed
   to do, those tears accomplished! The strong man was bowed and yielded
   himself to Christ--and when they got up from their knees in that little
   room, he took the pen, and changing the L into an S, wrote "Saved." He
   was saved because he came face to face with the fact that he was lost!
   His ill answer startled both himself and his child! May God work the
   same change in you, both for your own sake and also for the sake of
   your loved ones!

   I want to press you for some kind of answer because, like Eliezer, I
   have promised my Master to make a search for you and an ill answer will
   clear me of my oath. If I can get a, "No," from you as your answer, and
   am certain that you will not go with me to my Master's Son, I shall be
   clear. It was so with Abraham's servant--he and his master agreed to
   that at the first. When men say, "No," and entreaties are of no further
   use, and the preaching of the Gospel has no power over them, then we
   must leave them and carry the glad tidings to others, just as Paul and
   Barnabas of old said to the angry Jews at Antioch, "It was necessary
   that the Word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing
   you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
   lo, we turn to the Gentiles." I beseech you, do not put Christ away
   from you! And I press you for a definite answer. I say, as Eliezer
   said, "If you will deal kindly and truly with my Master, tell me: and
   if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."

   Now I want to have a little talk with you over this matter. My dear
   Friend, you are in peril of eternal death. While you are hesitating,
   life is ebbing. During the past few months, how many of our dear
   friends have been taken away by influenza and other causes! This
   congregation has suffered from sickness, in family after family, as I
   never knew it suffer before! May you not be taken? I charge you,
   therefore, do not act as though you had plenty of time. Possibly you
   have not another week to live! The clock, as it ticks, seems to me to
   say, "Now, now, now, now, now, now." And for some of you, there is an
   alarm in the clock, which, when it runs down, utters this warning, "Now
   or never, now or never, now or never."

   After all, the matter that we have in hand is not one that requires
   great debate! Whether I will believe the Truth of God or not should not
   be a matter of discussion. Whether I will receive the gift of God or
   not should not be a thing to be argued about if I am in my right mind!
   Whether, being lost, I am willing to be saved--whether, having the
   Gospel of eternal life proclaimed to me, I should accept it by
   faith--well, I need not ask the sages as to what I shall answer, nor
   need I go to the Law Courts to consult the judges as to my reply! This
   is a thing so simple that it requires no argument! Who will choose to
   be damned? Who will refuse eternal life? Surely these are questions
   that should be decided at once!

   Waiting and trifling have done you no good up to now. The countryman,
   when he wanted to cross the river, and found it deep, said that he
   would sit down and wait till the water was all gone by. He waited, but
   the river was just as deep after all his waiting! And with all your
   delay, the difficulties in the way of your accepting Christ do not get
   any less. If you look at the matter rightly, you will see that there
   are no great difficulties in the way, nor were there ever such
   obstacles as your imagination pictures.

   Another countryman, having to cross Cheapside one morning, was so
   confused by the traffic of omnibuses and cabs and foot passengers that
   he said he felt sure he could not get across the road and would wait
   till the people thinned out a little. But all day long they never did
   thin out. Unless he had waited till the evening, he would have found
   little difference in that perpetual stream of hurrying people. O
   Friends, you have waited until you can get "a convenient season" to
   become a Christian and, after all your delay, the way is not any
   clearer! Twenty years ago some of you were as near decisions for Christ
   as you are now. No, you seemed nearer! I then thought, "Oh, some of
   them will soon believe in Jesus and yield their hearts to Him!" But you
   said, then, that it was not quite time. Is it time now? Is the day
   without difficulty any nearer? Is the season any more suitable? No,
   indeed, there is no improvement!

   Let me say that I believe that your waiting has not only done you no
   good, but has positively done you great harm! There were times when it
   seemed easy for you to yield to the pressure of the Divine Spirit. It
   certainly is not easier now. Indeed, it is more difficult. I think
   sometimes God treats men as Benjamin Franklin treated the man who stood
   loafing in his bookshop and, at last took up a book and asked, "How
   much is this?" Franklin replied, "A shilling." "A shilling?" Franklin
   said, "a shilling." And he would not give the price. After staying
   about 10 minutes, he said, "Come, Mr. Franklin, now what will you take
   for it?" Franklin answered, "Two shillings." "No," he said, "you are
   joking!" "I am not joking," said Franklin, "the price is two
   shillings." The man waited and sat a while, thinking. "I want the
   book," he drawled out, "still, I will not give two shillings. What will
   you take for it?" Franklin said, "Three shillings." "Well," the man
   said, "why do you raise your price?" To which Franklin responded, "You
   see, you have wasted so much of my time that I could better have
   afforded to take one shilling at first than three shillings now."

   Sometimes, if men come to Christ at the very first invitation, it is a
   sweet and easy coming. See how dear young children often yield
   themselves to Christ and how peaceful is their entrance into the rest
   of faith! But when people wait. When they postpone believing. When they
   violate conscience. When they tread down all the uprising of holy
   thoughts within them, it becomes much harder for them to trust in
   Christ than it would have been when He was first preached to them. I
   come, therefore, to you, again, and say, "If you will deal kindly and
   truly with my Master, tell me. And if not, tell me, and tell me now."

   "Well," says one, "I am glad you have spoken to us. I will think it
   over." No, Friend, I do not mean that. I do not want you to think it
   over. You have had enough of thinking! I pray that God's Spirit may
   lead you to an immediate decision. "Well, suppose that we consider it
   during the week?" you ask. No, that will not suit either my Master or
   myself. I want the answer now. I am like a messenger carrying a letter
   on which is written, "The bearer will wait for a reply." I was once in
   a country town and I said to my host, when I went to bed, "I have to be
   in London tomorrow and I cannot get up in time for my work unless I
   leave by a train which I can catch readily enough if you wake me at six
   o'clock." Well, my host was an Irishman, so he woke me at five o'clock.
   And when I sat up in bed, I said, "What time is it?" He said, "You have
   only another hour to sleep."

   The consequence was that I missed my train. If He had only wakened me
   at the proper time and said, "Now you must get up," I would have
   dressed at once, but as he said, "You have only another hour to sleep,"
   of course I slept that hour and another one as well, for I was weary.
   The same principle applies to you. If I say to you, "Go home and think
   it over all the week," I shall be giving you a week in which to remain
   in rebellion against God! And I have no right to do that. I shall be
   giving you a week in which you are to continue an unbeliever--and he
   that is an unbeliever is in peril of eternal ruin, for, "He that
   believes not shall be damned." Worse than all, the week may lead to
   many other weeks--to months, perhaps, and years--perhaps to a whole
   eternity of woe! I cannot give you five minutes! God the Holy Spirit
   speaks by me, now, to souls whom God has chosen from before the
   foundation of the world! And He says, "Today, if you will hear His
   voice, harden not your hearts." The Holy Spirit says, "Today, even
   today." "Turn you, turn you from your evil ways; for why will you die,
   O house of Israel?" The question comes to you, Will you be Christ's?
   "If you will deal kindly and truly with my Master, tell me: and if not,
   tell me."

   The best answer you can give is in the verses that follow the text.
   "Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the Lord:
   we cannot speak unto you bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before you;
   take her." Oh I wish some of you would thus respond to my appeal this
   day! This thing is also from the Lord--it was He who gave me this
   message--it was He who brought you to hear it! Surely you will not be
   found fighting against God! Your heart is open to Him--He sees the
   faintest desire that you have toward Him. Breathe out your wish, now,
   and say, "My heart is before You--take it."--

   "Take my poor heart, and let it be

   Forever closed to all but Thee!

   Seal You my breast and let me wear

   That pledge of love forever there." He will not be slow to accept that
   which is offered to Him! He will take you now and He will keep you
   forever!

   "How is it to be done?" says one. The plan is very simple. Jesus Christ
   took upon Himself the sins of all who ever will trust Him. Come and
   rest upon His atoning Sacrifice. Give yourself up to Him wholly and
   unreservedly and He will save you. Take Him to be your Savior by the
   simple act of faith. The pith of the matter is that I, being lost, give
   myself over to

   Christ to save me. I believe that the act of faith was very well set
   forth in the statement of a poor imbecile. They said that he was an
   idiot, but I think that he had more real sense than many a man who
   boasts of his intellect. Someone said to him, "John, have you got a
   soul? "No," he said, "I ain't got no soul." "Why, John, how is that?"
   He replied, "I had a soul once, but I lost it, and Jesus Christ found
   it, so I have just let Him keep it." There is the whole philosophy of
   salvation. You have lost your soul. Christ has found it! Let Him keep
   it! God bless you! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Genesis 24.
     __________________________________________________________________

Christ's Motive and Ours

   (No. 2232)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For your sakes." 2 Corinthians 8:9.

   "For His sake." Philippians 1:29.

   The true test of any action lies in its motive. Many a deed which seems
   to be glorious is really mean and ignoble because it is done with a
   base intention. While other actions which appear to be poor and paltry,
   if we truly understood them, would be seen to be full of the glory and
   beauty of a noble purpose. The mainspring of a watch is the most
   important part of it. The spring of an action is everything. My sermon
   from these two texts will be on the motive which inspired Christ's
   redeeming work and the motive which should inspire our service for Him.
   He did all for our sakes--we should do all for His sake. Fix your
   attention, then, chiefly, not on the deed, but on the motive which is
   its root.

   The less of self in any effort, the nobler it is. A great work,
   undertaken and completed from selfish motives, is much less
   praiseworthy than the feeble endeavor put forth to help other people.
   Selfishness is, perhaps, the worst of all meanness, but spiritual
   selfishness is the form of the evil most to be dreaded. With Christ
   there was no self-seeking. Not for Himself did He come to earth--not
   for Himself did He suffer. He lived for others and died for others.
   "For you know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was
   rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you, through His poverty,
   might be rich." In this glorious unselfishness Christ is not only our
   Savior, He is also our Example. As He did not live for self, we, too,
   must learn to deny ourselves and live like He. It is in living and
   acting, "for His sake," that we shall most truly "follow His steps."

   We are often told, in these days, that we should live for the good of
   others, and we ought to heed the call. But there is so little in our
   fellow men to call forth the spirit of self-sacrifice that if we have
   no higher motive, we shall soon become tired of our efforts on their
   behalf. The true way is to live for Christ and then, "for His sake,"
   seek to save our fellow men. With such a constraining power we shall
   not be weary in well-doing, for though men may fail us, and frequent
   discouragement meet us in our toil, our impelling force will always be
   the same. As we whisper it to ourselves again and again, "for His
   sake," we shall be made strong to do or to suffer.

   If you thus go forth to the service of each day, "for His sake,"
   realizing that He, "for your sakes," gave Himself to toil and agony,
   and even to death, itself, you will daily grow into sympathy with
   Christ. His Divine compassion for men will take hold upon you--you will
   be lifted up above the life of the world and, as you go about doing
   good, you will be able to touch the sorrow of the earth with a tender
   hand. You will grow like He you serve.

   I have heard of a man who lived in a certain town and while he lived,
   was greatly misunderstood. It was known that he had a large income, yet
   he lived a miserly life, and loud were the murmurs at the scanty help
   he gave to those around him. He stinted himself in many ways and
   hoarded his money. But when he died, the popular verdict was reversed,
   for then the motive of all his economy was manifested. He left his
   fortune to build a reservoir and an aqueduct, to bring a constant
   supply of pure water to the town where he had been despised and
   misunderstood! This was the chief need of the people and for a long
   time they had suffered much from drought and disease because of the
   scanty water supply. All the years that they had misjudged him, he was
   silently and unselfishly living for their sakes. When they discovered
   his motive, it was too late to do anything for him further than to hand
   down to future generations the memory of his noble and generous deed.
   But we can do much, "for His sake," who has brought to us the living
   water and who, though He died for us,

   is now alive, again, and will live forevermore. If He thus loved me,
   and lived for me, nothing that I can do is too much for

   Him--

   "When often, like a wayward child, I murmur at His will,

   Then this sweet word, 'For Jesus'sake,'

   My restless heart can still.

   I bow my head and gently led,

   His easy yoke I take--

   And all the day, and all the way,

   An echo in my heart shall say--

   'For Jesus sake!'"

   Without dwelling on the immediate connection of the words which I have
   chosen from two familiar and beautiful verses, I would, with these two
   texts, weave a fabric of love. See what Jesus did for us and then think
   what we can do for Jesus. "For your sakes" Christ did His deeds of
   love. "For His sake" we are called upon to live and labor among the
   sons of men. May His love enkindle ours!

   I. First, let us consider THE MOTIVE OF CHRIST'S WORK. "For your
   sakes." As many of you as have believed in Christ Jesus may know that,
   "foryour sakes," the Lord of Glory stooped to be a suffering, dying
   Man.

   In meditating on the motive that moved the Lord Jesus to come to your
   rescue, consider, first, the august Person who undertook your salvation
   and died, "for your sakes." He was God. "He thought it not robbery to
   be equal with God." He made the heavens. "Without Him was not anything
   made that was made." The angels delighted to do Him homage! Every
   seraph's wing would fly at His bidding--all the host of Heaven
   worshipped at His feet. All the powers of Nature were under His
   control. He needed nothing to make Him glorious--all things were His
   and the power to make more than all! He might truly say, "If I were
   hungry, I would not tell you: for the world is Mine and the fullness
   thereof."

   Hymned day without night by all the sacred choristers, He did not lack
   for praise. Nor did He lack for servants-- legions of angels were
   always ready to do His commands, hearkening unto the voice of His word.
   It was this God, this Ever-Blessed One who was, from eternity with the
   Father, and in whom the Father had infinite delight, who looked upon
   men with the eye of love! He that was born in Bethlehem's manger was
   the Infinite as well as the Infant. And He that lived, here, the life
   of a peasant, toiling and suffering, was that same God who made the
   heavens and the earth, but who deigned to be Incarnate for our sakes.
   Well might Isaiah, in his prophetic vision, proclaim the royal titles
   of the "Child" who was to be born and the "Son" who, in the fullness of
   time, would be given to us and for us--"The government shall be upon
   His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The
   Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."

   Let this Truth of God sink into your souls, that it was God who came
   from Heaven, "for your sakes." It was no inferior being, no one like
   yourselves, but it was very God of very God who loved you with an
   everlasting and infinite affection! I have often turned that thought
   over in my mind, but I have never been able to express it as I have
   wished. If I were told that all the sons of men cared for me, that
   would be but as a drop in a bucket compared with Jehovah, Himself,
   regarding me! If it were said that all the princes of the earth had
   fallen at some poor man's feet and laid aside their dignities that they
   might relieve his necessities, it would be counted condescending
   kindness--but such an act would not be worthy to be spoken of in
   comparison with that infinite condescension and unparalleled love which
   brought the Savior from the skies to rescue and redeem such worthless
   rebels as we were! It is not possible that all the condescension of all
   the kind and compassionate men who have ever lived should be more than
   as a small grain that could not turn the scale compared with the
   everlasting hills of the Savior's wondrous love!

   Think, too, of the insignificant clients on whom all this wealth of
   affection was poured. As you remember the Person who came here, "for
   your sakes," and then, wonderful stoop! consider who you are--who we
   are--for whose sakes He died, do not our hearts melt at the thought?
   Brothers and Sisters, if we truly know ourselves, we have a very poor
   opinion of ourselves when compared with Christ! Humility has been
   rightly said to be a correct estimate of ourselves. What were we but
   the most insignificant creatures? If our whole race had been blotted
   out, there need have been no gap in the creation of God, or if there
   had seemed to be a void for a moment, He had but to speak the word and
   myriads of crea-

   tures, prompt to obey His will, would have filled up the space! How was
   it that Jesus, the Son of God, should suffer for such insignificant
   worms--such insects of an hour as we are?

   But we are not only insignificant, we are also wicked. "We have sinned
   with our fathers. We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly."
   Even the Lord's children have to confess, "All we, like sheep, have
   gone astray; we have turned, everyone, to his own way." But, oh, wonder
   of love, they can add, "and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us
   all!" As sinners, we deserve nothing but God's thunderbolts, yet,
   trusting in His dear Son, we receive nothing but His mercy! Having
   desperately sinned and broken all His Commandments, if He had said,
   "Perish forever, you guilty rebels," He would have spoken only the
   sentence that strict justice required. Instead of that, He said to His
   Only-Begotten, "You shall die that they may not die. I will take You,
   My Son, My Isaac, and offer You upon the altar of sacrifice that
   through Your death men may live." This is, indeed, a marvel of Grace!
   This must be one of the things the angels desire to look into! Our
   thoughts cannot compass this wondrous work, nor can our words describe
   it!

   Many of us, also, were not only sinful, as the whole race is, but we
   were peculiarly sinful. Some of us feel inclined to dispute with Saul
   of Tarsus for the title, "chief of sinners." It will always remain a
   wonder to me that the Son of God should have condescended to die for
   me. Were you a drunk and has the Holy Spirit shown you that Jesus died
   for you? And are you now rejoicing that you are washed in His precious
   blood? Were you one of the women who, like Mary Magdalene, were rightly
   called sinners? And have you, like she, washed your robes and made them
   white in the blood of the Lamb? Then you are constrained to exclaim
   with wonder and gratitude--

   "Depth of mercy, can there be Mercy still reserved for me? Can my God
   His wrath forbear? Me, the chief of sinners, spare?"

   I fancy that I hear one and another of you adoring God's matchless
   mercy and saying, with wonder and surprise, "Is it really true that
   mercy is brought to me by God's own Son? Could nothing less than the
   death of the Only-Begotten save my sinful soul? Did He condescend to
   die for me? Well may I admire the Grace thus manifested and raise my
   glad song of thanksgiving to Him who has done such great things for
   me!" Each of us can see some peculiarity in his own case. Some of us
   have not offended so grievously in outward conduct as others have done,
   but, then, we had better instruction in our childhood and,
   consequently, our sins were doubly heinous, for we sinned against light
   and knowledge! Some of us have had to violate our conscience terribly
   in order to sin as we have done. It may be that some of you lived 40 or
   50 years as unbelievers and yet, at last, you were brought to bow at
   the dear feet that were pierced for you. Oh, I am sure you bless His
   name that ever He shed His blood for you--and I dare say you feel as I
   do, sometimes, that none in the Glory Land will be able to raise such a
   song of adoring gratitude as you will when all Heaven shall ring with
   the grand chorus of those who have been redeemed from among men!

   Thus have we considered, first, the august Person who accomplished the
   great work of our redemption. And, secondly, the poor sinful creatures
   for whose sake He suffered.

   Now let me invite you to consider the wondrous work which this master
   motive inspired. "For your sakes" God became Incarnate--the Son of God
   took into union with Himself our nature--without which He could not
   have suffered and died. We read concerning Him, "Being found in fashion
   as a Man, He humbled Himself." If we had never heard of that fact,
   before, our ears and heart would be astonished at the words! At the end
   of each clause I feel inclined to pause, and say, "Look! Look! Was
   there ever such a wonder as this--the Infinite became Incarnate! He ate
   and He hungered! He drank and He thirsted! He needed to be housed from
   the wintry storm, but He "had not where to lay His head." He wanted
   human sympathy, but, "all His disciples forsook Him and fled." He was
   the "Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief," and all, "for your
   sakes."

   The words that follow our text tell us that, "He became poor." You know
   that, in this world, the poverty of a man is usually reckoned in
   proportion to the position of affluence from which he has come down.
   One who was born a pauper is not relatively so poor as the man who was
   once a king, but has been reduced to beggary, for in the one case there
   is no experience of the luxury which riches can command, and in the
   other no adaptability to the shifts and privations of those who have
   always been in poverty. When the Christ of God, the King of Kings, the
   Lord of Lords, was forsaken by His Father, deserted by His friends, and
   left alone to suffer, "for your sakes," that was the direst poverty
   that was ever known!

   See your Lord beneath the olives of Gethsemane! Bloody sweat falls to
   the ground as, being in an agony, He prays more earnestly--"If it is
   possible, let this cup pass from Me"--but it must not pass from Him.
   "For your sakes" He must drink it! "For your sakes" every bitter drop
   must be drained! Then see Him as He stands, without an advocate, before
   Herod, Pilate and Caiaphas--"taken from prison and from judgment." Mark
   His sufferings as they hound Him through the streets of Jerusalem,
   along the Sorrowful Way! Behold Him as, at last, they fasten His hands
   and His feet to the cruel wood and lift Him up 'twixt earth and Heaven,
   to suffer the death of the Cross! Let those who will, depreciate the
   sufferings of Christ--I believe there was in the God-Man, Christ Jesus,
   an infinite capacity for suffering and that His body, so wondrously
   formed, was able to endure and did endure, infinitely more than human
   thought can imagine--while, at the same time, the sufferings of His
   soul were the very soul of His sufferings! Well did the Spirit-taught
   poet, Joseph Hart, write--

   "Much we talk of Jesus' blood, But how little's understood! Of His
   sufferings, so intense, Angels ha ve no perfect sense. Who can rightly
   comprehend Their beginning or their end? 'Tis to God and God alone That
   their weight is fully known." All this Christ suffered, "for your
   sakes." What love and gratitude ought to fill your heart as you think
   of all that Jesus bore on your behalf! If you had a wife who, when you
   lay sick, watched you with such anxious care that she undermined her
   own health and brought herself down to the grave through her devotion
   to you, oh, with what love you think of her, that she should suffer
   even unto death for your sake! If you were ever delivered from a watery
   grave, and the brave fellow who rescued you, himself, sank back into
   the water and was drowned, you can never forgot his noble
   self-sacrifice, but you will always cherish his memory, for he died for
   your sake!

   There is a story I have often read, of an American gentleman who was
   accustomed to go frequently to a tomb and plant fresh flowers. When
   someone asked why he did so, he said that when the time came for him to
   go to the war, he was detained by some business and the man who lay
   beneath the sod became his substitute, performed his duty and died in
   the battle. Over that carefully-kept grave, he had the words inscribed,
   "He died for me!" There is something melting in the thought of another
   dying for you--how much more melting is it when that One is the Christ
   of Calvary! Why, you feel, "Here is One of whom I never deserved
   anything, taking my place! Here is One whom I have badly treated and
   against whom I have offended--yet He suffered for me--He took my place,
   He bore my sins, He died for me! Therefore I will live for Him. I will
   love Him. I will give myself wholly and unreservedly to Him and to His
   blessed service." "For your sakes" Christ died. If you believe that,
   you cannot help loving and serving Him! It is an old theme which I am
   bringing before your minds, but it is the grandest theme that ever
   inspired a mortal tongue, or stirred a human heart!

   I want you that love the Lord to consider, next, the comprehensive
   motive for which He worked the wondrous work which I have so
   imperfectly described--"For your sakes." I would have you remember that
   everything He was and everything He did was, "for your sakes." "For
   your sakes" the midnight prayer upon the bleak mountain's side. "For
   your sakes" the scoffing and the jeering that followed Him wherever He
   went. "For your sakes" the agony in the garden. "For your sakes" the
   flagellation of the Roman lash. "For your sakes" He gave His back to
   the smiters and His cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. "For your
   sakes" the shame and the spitting. "For your sakes," He "became
   obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross." Say it, my Brothers
   and Sisters! Let your hearts say it now and wet the words with
   tears--"For our sakes He suffered all this."

   Think of Him for a moment as He is taken down from the Cross. In fair
   white linen they wrap that blessed body, covered with its own blood. I
   think I see Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, and Joseph of Arimathea,
   looking on that poor mangled frame. Those dear eyes, once so bright
   with love, now closed in death. Those wonder-working hands that
   multiplied the loaves and fishes, now stiff and cold. And those blessed
   feet that trod the sea, now all lifeless. O Joseph, and you, Mary, this
   was for you--"for your sakes"! But also for mine and for the sake of
   all my Brothers and Sisters who are resting by faith on that finished
   Sacrifice! They laid the dear body in Joseph's new tomb, the virgin
   sepulcher wherein

   never man had lain, and there they left our great Champion sleeping a
   while in the darkness of death. As He lay there, it was "for your
   sakes."

   Yes, and blessed be His name, when the appointed morning came, He lived
   again, the stone was rolled away from the sepulcher and He came forth
   from the tomb! It was, "for your sakes," He rose. The 40 days He lived
   on earth were "for your sakes." And when from off the brow of Olivet He
   ascended to His Father's right hand, it was, "for your sakes." He said
   to His disciples, "I go to prepare a place for you." There, seated on
   His Throne of Glory, He holds the scepter and rules all worlds, "for
   your sakes." There as an Intercessor, He pleads with God, "for your
   sakes." There is not a gem in His crown but it is there, "for your
   sakes." There is not a jewel on His breastplate but it is there, "for
   your sakes." From head to foot He is what He is, "for your sakes." And
   when He shall come a second time--as soon He will--to judge the world
   in righteousness, and to "gather together His elect from the four
   winds, from one end of Heaven to the other" to usher in the reign of
   truth and establish His Throne forever, it will be all, "for your
   sakes," who have believed on His name! "For all things are for your
   sakes, that the abundant Grace might through the thanksgiving of many
   redound to the glory of God."

   We might thus continue, but we will not. May God make this thought burn
   in your heart--All that Christ has done for us is for our sakes! I
   suppose it is because we are such fallen creatures that these
   considerations do not move us as they should. Granite is wax compared
   with our hearts! Oh, that we did but feel the fire of Jesus' love! Like
   coals of juniper which have a most vehement flame, our hearts should
   burn within us while we talked of that dear love which brought Him to
   the grave and took Him from the grave to the heavens--and shall bring
   Him back from the heavens to take His people up to be with Him where He
   is and to live with Him forever!

   II. Having meditated on the motive which moved Christ in the work He
   accomplished for us, let us consider THE MOTIVE WHICH SHOULD INSPIRE
   ALL OUR SERVICE FOR HIM--"For His sake."

   This second text is in the Epistle to the Philippians, first chapter,
   and 29th verse. "Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only
   to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake." What are we that
   we should be allowed the high honor of suffering, "for His sake"? It is
   a great privilege to do, or to be, or to bear anything for Him. Our
   suffering can never be worth a thought when compared with His--and any
   sacrifice that we could offer, "for His sake," would be small, indeed,
   when contrasted with the infinite Sacrifice that He has already made
   for our sakes. If you are rejoicing in the fact that Christ died for
   you, it will be very easy to prompt in your hearts the desire to do
   something, "for His sake."

   I find in Scripture that the thought expressed in the words, "for His
   sake," may be enlarged and assume six or seven phases. For instance, in
   the Gospel of Matthew, fifth chapter, and 10th verse, our Lord puts it,
   "for righteousness' sake"--"Blessed are they which are persecuted for
   righteousness' sake." I understand, then, that if a man suffers as a
   Christian for doing that which is right, he is suffering for Christ's
   sake. If he cannot and will not act disreputably and contrary to the
   commands of God, as others do, the suffering which he willingly bears,
   the loss which he cheerfully incurs because of his uprightness, is so
   much borne for Christ's sake.

   If a man is out-and-out righteous in this world, he will be sure to be
   pointed at by certain persons as an oddity. He cannot lie, as others
   lie, nor practice tricks in trade as others do--nor frequent their
   places of amusement, nor indulge in their lusts and, therefore,
   straightway they say--"He is a hypocrite! He is a cant!" And as they
   cannot understand the principle which inspires him, they impute to him
   motives which he abhors. This is how they talk--"He is doing it for the
   sake of being thought a saint," "He is paid for it." "He has some
   sinister motive or other." Or else they sum up the whole matter by
   declaring, "He is a downright impostor."

   Now, if in any of these ways you are made to suffer for that which is
   right--for speaking the truth and acting the truth--never mind,
   Brothers and Sisters, but rather rejoice that you are permitted to
   suffer for Christ's sake! Say within yourself, "If my dear Lord lost
   all things for me, I may well lose some things for Him. If He was
   stripped to the last rag for me, I may well be content to be poor, 'for
   His sake.'" Set your face like a flint and say, "We can be poor, but we
   cannot be dishonest. We can suffer, but we cannot sin." Many men say,
   when we talk to them thus, "But, you know, we must live." I do not see
   that there is any necessity for your living if you cannot live
   honestly. It would be better to die than to do wrong--any amount of
   suffering would be better than that we should deny our Lord and Master!
   Remember Peter's words, "If you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy
   are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; but

   sanctify the Lord God in your hearts," or, as the Revised Version has
   the last clause, "Sanctify in your hearts Christ as

   Lord."

   In the Word of God, yet another form is given to this suffering or
   doing for Christ's sake, and it assumes this shape--"for the Gospel's
   sake." In His first Epistle to the Corinthians, ninth chapter, and 23rd
   verse, Paul writes of what he did, "for the Gospel's sake," and our
   Lord speaks of some who, when there was persecution, "for the Word's
   sake," were offended. Now, if you are put to any shame for the sake of
   the Gospel, you suffer, "for His sake." And if you labor to spread the
   Gospel and publish the Word of God--if it is your daily endeavor to
   tell to others God's way of salvation, you are doing something, "for
   His sake," for the Gospel and Christ are so wrapped up together that
   what is done for the Gospel's sake, is done, "for His sake."

   Yet another view of the subject is given to us when the Apostle, in his
   letter to the Colossians, first chapter, and 24th verse, speaks of
   certain saints honoring Christ by suffering, "for His body's sake,
   which is the Church." That is another form of rendering homage to
   Christ and doing what we do, "for His sake." O Brothers and Sisters, we
   ought to do much more than we do for God's people! They are the body of
   Christ. We should, everyone of us, feel it an honor to be allowed to
   unloose the laces of His shoes and to wash His feet--well, poor saints
   are Christ's feet! When you are feeding them, you are feeding Him, for
   certainly, if Paul, in persecuting them, persecuted Christ, it is clear
   that you, when you are helping them for Christ's sake, are doing it for
   Him! Oh, lay out your lives for His Church's sake! His dear people
   deserve it at your hands and their Lord deserves it, too.

   Then, again, Paul, in His second Epistle to Timothy, second chapter,
   and 10th verse, uses the phrase, "for the elect's sakes," by which I
   think he comprehends, not only those who are in the Church as yet, but
   those who are to be. Happy is that man who spends all his time in
   seeking out poor wanderers, that he may bring in God's elect! Happy is
   he who lays all his talents and all his strength upon the altar of God,
   consecrated to this aim--that he may find out the chosen of the Father,
   the redeemed by the blood of Jesus and, in the hand of the Spirit, be
   the instrument of bringing them back to their Father's house from which
   they have wandered. When you serve Christ's people, always do it, "for
   His sake."

   Further, we have the expression, "the Kingdom of God's sake," when our
   Master tells Peter, as recorded in the 18th chapter of Luke, 29th
   verse, that no one who has left anything for Him and for it, shall fail
   of present and eternal reward. This is another way in which we can
   serve Christ our King, by being willing to sacrifice "house, or
   parents, or brothers and sisters, or wife, or children, for the Kingdom
   of God's sake."

   There is one other remarkable expression used by John in his second
   Epistle, at the second verse. He there speaks of something done, "for
   the Truth's sake, which dwells in us." Ah, it is not merely the Gospel
   we are to defend, but we are to defend that living Seed which the Holy
   Spirit has put into us, that Truth of God which we have tasted, handled
   and felt--that theology which is not that of the Book, only, but that
   which is written on the fleshy tablets of our hearts. I hope there are
   many of you who keep back your hand from sin because the Truth that is
   in you will not let you touch it-- and who put forth both your hands to
   serve the Lord because the Truth that is in you compels you to it! The
   new nature, that living, incorruptible Seed, constrains you and you
   judge that if Christ died for you, you must live and, if necessary, you
   will die for Him. I would ask great things from those for whom Christ
   has done great things. When you make sin little, and Hell little, you
   also make Christ little--and then, in consequence, you think you owe
   Him but little and you will render Him but little. But when you feel
   the weight of sin and see the preciousness of your Redeemer and feel,
   in some measure, the obligations under which you are to Him, then you
   say--

   "Oh! what shall I do, my Sa vior to praise."

   There have been, in the Christian Church, at different times, men and
   women of highly consecrated spirit who seem to have realized what their
   Lord expected of them. I dare say that they were very dissatisfied with
   themselves, but as we read their biographies, we are charmed with their
   consecration of spirit. The Truth of God and especially the Christ, who
   is the Truth, had such influence over their lives, that they truly
   lived, "for His sake." May we have many such in our ranks! I do not
   know whether it may be the duty of any of you to go to foreign lands,
   "for His sake." I only hope there are some young men here who will
   offer themselves for missionary service, for blessed are they that bear
   the Gospel into "the regions beyond," carrying their lives in their
   hands! They shall stand very near to the eternal Throne of God in the
   day when the King rewards His faithful servants.

   I do not know whether there may be any of our Sisters here who are
   bound to consecrate their lives to the nursing of the sick where fevers
   are rife, or where pestilence abounds, but they who can do such service
   to humanity, for Christ's sake, shall receive no light word of
   approbation at the Last Great Day. But, probably, the mass of us will
   have to abide in our calling and, therefore, I would say, if we must do
   so, let our life be all, "for His sake." I would desire never to come
   to this platform but, "for His sake." Never to say even a word about
   the Gospel but, "for His sake." And you, in your home, dear mother, go
   and bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
   "for His sake." Take those dear little ones and present them to Him.
   Say, "Jesus, I give them to You--accept and save them. I devote them to
   Your service, as Hannah gave Samuel to the Lord." Then, "for His sake,"
   teach them holiness. "For His sake" be patient with them and, "for His
   sake," bring them up, always, in the fear of the Lord.

   You men of business, go out and labor, "for His sake." I could almost
   envy some of you who have acquired an adequate income. Keep the
   warehouse or shop open, "for His sake," and give more largely to His
   cause. And you who are not in a position of competence, but are
   struggling for your daily bread, "for His sake," never do a wrong
   thing. Sometimes, when you are half inclined to yield to the tempter,
   imagine that your Savior is standing by your side and that He puts His
   pierced hand upon your shoulder and says, "If you are, indeed, bought
   with My blood, let there be justice in all your dealings with your
   fellows. No, more, be generous as well as just, for My sake, for I
   would have you so act that all men shall know that you are My
   disciple."

   Perhaps some of you, who profess to be Christians, are living
   altogether for yourselves, instead of living unto God. When you are at
   home tonight, sitting quietly in your room, alone, I could half wish
   that the Lord Jesus would enter and say to you, "I have loved you with
   an everlasting love, and laid down My life for you. What are you doing
   for Me in return?" Suppose He looked at you with those gentle, yet
   heart-searching eyes of His, and you looked into that face which was
   marred more than any man's, what would you say? Oh, I think I should
   have to cover my face for very shame! And yet I am not living in
   forgetfulness of Him and I am trying to do Him some humble service. But
   as for those who do nothing, with the exception of sitting to hear
   sermons, or sometimes dropping in at a Prayer Meeting, or, now and
   then, giving a little to the cause of God--perhaps as little as they
   dare--oh, what would they say in His Presence? You will all be in His
   Presence, soon! Perhaps sooner than you expect--and among the sorrows
   that will trouble you on your deathbed, if you are unfaithful to your
   Lord, will be this--that you have done so little for Him while you had
   the opportunity.

   When sitting by the side of one of our dying members, a poor weak girl,
   wasted by consumption, I was charmed as she whispered in my ear that
   when she was brought to Jesus, she had such joy that she had striven to
   do something for Him but mourned that she could accomplish so little.
   Poor child! She tried to teach a class of boys and half killed herself
   in the struggle to keep them quiet. She felt constrained, by love to
   her Lord, to try to do something for Him, and as there happened to be
   nothing else to do, she began to teach some rough children who were far
   too wild for her. But she did not regret it. Oh, no! I am sure, if she
   could be raised up, she would take to such work, again, "for His sake."
   And I am sure that any of you, if you have given of your substance, or
   given of your time, or given of your abilities, "for His sake," will
   never have to say, when you are lying as she was, and breathing out
   your life, "I did too much for my Savior." You will rather bless His
   name that He accepted the little that you could do! And like our young
   Sister, mourn that it is so little compared with what He deserves!

   I therefore say to each one of you, Brothers and Sisters--If you have,
   indeed, been washed in the blood of Christ, spend yourself for Him--do
   not mock Him. If it was in play that you were redeemed and if the
   Crucifixion was but a sport, then go and trifle with the service of
   Christ. But if, indeed, the blood-mark of a real Savior is upon you and
   you have been washed in the fountain filled with His precious blood, go
   and live really useful, consecrated lives into which you shall throw
   your whole heart and soul and strength, "for His sake!"

   Who shall pile a monument worthy of the Savior who did so much, "for
   your sakes?" Who shall compose a song sweet enough for the Christ of
   God who came for our redemption? Who shall sound the trumpets loudly
   enough for Im-manuel, who, though He was rich, yet for our sakes became
   poor? Who shall bring offerings of gold and frankincense rich enough
   for Him who gave up all for His people? Crown Him, you angels! You
   seraphim, adore Him! O God, You alone can give Him the recompense of
   honor which He merits! Glory be to His name forever! Let us take as our
   motto, from now on, these words, "For His sake." "For His sake," let us
   put up with poverty, counting it to be richest to be

   poor if He would have it so. "For His sake," let us cheerfully endure
   bodily sufferings, being glad if they make us more useful for Him. "For
   His sake," let us live in toil and die in obscurity, if so we can best
   glorify Him. Let our song be that of the gifted songstress, of whose
   hymn I have already quoted one verse--

   "In suffering sore, or toilsome task,

   His burden light I'll bear;

   'For Jesus 'sake'shall sweeten all,

   Till His bright home I share.

   And then this song more sweet, more strong,

   In Heaven my harp shall wake--

   Led all the way, till that glad day

   Eternally, my heart shall say,

   'For Jesus sake.'"

   I will close when I have only added that if any of you have not at
   present any interest in this sacrifice and this service of which my two
   texts speak, I have just this word for you. It is, at least, a blessing
   that you are still permitted to listen to the Gospel. Let me very
   briefly tell once more, "the old, old story of Jesus and His love."
   Jesus Christ died in the place of sinners. We deserved to be punished
   for our sins. Under the Law of Moses there was no pardon for sin except
   through the blood of a sacrifice. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the
   one Sacrifice for sins forever, of which the thousands of bullocks and
   lambs slain under the Law were but types. Every man who trusts to the
   death of the Lamb of God may know that Jesus Christ was punished in His
   place, so that God can be just and yet forgive the guilty. He can,
   without violating His justice, remit sin and pardon iniquity because a
   Substitute has been found whose death has an infinite value because of
   the Divine Nature of the Sufferer. He has borne the iniquities of all
   who trust Him. "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life."
   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall go your way a saved
   soul, even though you came into this house steeped in sin, or through
   terrible conviction on the very verge of despair. God grant that many
   of you may trust in Jesus this very hour, "for His sake!" Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--2 Corinthians 8.

Both Sides of the Shield

   (No. 2233)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 6, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 14,
   1891.

   "Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses said
   unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow
   I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand."
   Exodus 17:8,9.

   IN trying to understand the Truth of God we are in great danger of
   being one-sided. One man catches at part of a Truth of God and says,
   "That is it and that is the whole of it." Another man lays hold of
   another side of the Truth of God and he says, "This is the whole of it"
   and, straightaway, there arises a contention between them. They are
   like the men who quarreled as to the material of which a certain shield
   was made. One of them said that it was a golden shield. The other was
   equally sure that it was a silver one, whereas it so happened that it
   was gold on one side and silver on the other. So they fiercely wrangled
   when they might very well have been agreed if they had known a little
   more. Most Truths of God have two sides and it is well to try to see
   both of them. Nearly every doctrine in the Word of God is balanced by
   some other doctrine and many of the differences among the people of God
   have arisen from the undue stress which has been laid on one aspect of
   the Truth while the other side has been altogether neglected. This
   danger very frequently besets us.

   For instance, some see the Sovereignty of God and are so carried away
   with that sublime Truth, that they deny the responsibility of man! They
   thus both wrest the doctrine they do know and fight against the
   doctrine they do not know. Others can see the universality of the
   Gospel invitation and, with large hearts can urge all men to turn unto
   God and live--but they have never seen the specialty of this redemptive
   work of Christ and so fail to understand the eternal purpose of God to
   save His chosen people. Running away with half a Truth, they are like
   men that go through the wilderness wearing only one shoe--they become
   lame in one foot--and that makes them limp all over. It does not matter
   which foot it is that is lame--the man is a cripple if either foot is
   thus afflicted.

   It is essential for us to hold our minds ready to receive whatever the
   Holy Spirit teaches--and frequently to accept Truths of God which we
   cannot harmonize. I have long ago given up all attempts to reconcile
   what God has revealed in one part of the Bible with what He has made
   known in another part. If I find, in God's Word, doctrines which appear
   to me to be at variance with the teaching in other passages, I say to
   myself, "God knows where these things harmonize and if He had wanted me
   to know it, He would have told me. As He has not told me, why should I
   worry myself about the matter? I am not going to speculate and theorize
   as to where these Truths meet. Nor will I cast a bridge of gossamer
   across the deep gulf which I fancy I see and then trust myself to a
   thread that cannot bear my weight! "The secret things belong unto the
   Lord our God, but those things which are revealed, belong unto us and
   to our children forever."

   One said to me, the other day, concerning two great doctrines, "How do
   you make these two agree?" I answered by first asking another question,
   "How do I make two things agree that never fell out? There is no need
   for me to attempt anything of the kind. These two Truths are perfectly
   reconcilable and as they come from God's mouth, it would be as
   difficult for you to show that they do not agree as it is for me to
   show that they do agree." God does not say, "Yes," and "No." The Lord
   does not blow hot and cold. If He reveals two doctrines which
   apparently contradict each other, yet are they both true, since both
   are spoken by the God who cannot lie! And if I cannot see how they can
   both be true, it comforts me to think that I am not asked to see it--I
   am expected to believe it--and God's Grace gives me the faith to do
   even that. In fact, I rather like a difficulty, for then there is an
   opportunity for the exercise of faith. It is glorious, when

   one is sailing, to come right up under the lee of a great rock and to
   be compelled to say, "Well, I cannot proceed any further this way."
   What then? Why, just let your anchor down and make a harbor of the
   rock, and lie there at rest while stormy winds blow.

   That is what you should do with difficult doctrines--make a quiet haven
   of the mysterious Truth of God and let it shelter you in time of doubt
   or despondency! When the storm is passed, you will find that there are
   other ways for you to go where it is perfectly plain sailing. Seeing
   that the Revelation is Divine, there must be mysteries which mortals
   cannot understand at present. Let us comfort ourselves with our
   Savior's words, "What you know not now, you shall know hereafter." Some
   day the way will be made plain before us, but meanwhile our attitude
   should be that of trustful children who believe implicitly whatever
   their loving father tells them, whether they comprehend it or not.

   In the present discourse I am going to take up two sets of Truths which
   are rather varied and yet are very practical. My range of thought will
   be extensive, but I will not wander from the incident before us. There
   are four things which have been suggested to my mind while meditating
   upon this text and its surroundings, each of which may be viewed from
   two standpoints. First, in this assault of Amalek on the people of God,
   we see persecution in its double aspect. Secondly, in the rod of Moses
   we behold instrumentality in its double relation. Thirdly, in the
   battle we observe prudence in its double activity. And lastly, in the
   leaders of the people we are reminded of Christ in His double capacity
   as He pleads for us yonder and fights for us here.

   I. First, let us look at PERSECUTION IN ITS DOUBLE ASPECT. On the one
   hand, notice that this attack upon Israel was Amalek's great sin, on
   account of which the nation was doomed to be extirpated. Because of
   this, God said, "I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from
   under Heaven." But, on the other hand, this assault was the result of
   Israel's sin, for it is significantly put after the strife of Massah
   and Meribah, "Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim."
   The point is this--persecution may come to you from evil men,
   distinctly from them--and it may be their wicked free will which makes
   them assail you. But, at the same time, it may be your sin which lies
   at the bottom of it, and because you have erred, they have been
   permitted and even appointed, to bring trouble upon you. Let us think
   of these two things.

   Notice well that assaults upon us may arise from the sins of others. It
   is right that we should recognize this, lest in the dark day we should
   become unduly discouraged. Persecution often arises because we come
   into conflict with wicked men, but God will judge our adversaries--He
   will remember His Covenant with His people and deliver us from the hand
   of all our enemies.

   These Amalekites attacked Israel and greatly sinned in so doing, for
   they were the first that made war against God's people. He who had so
   graciously chosen and kept them, who, with a mighty hand and an
   outstretched arm had brought them through the Red Sea, had espoused
   their cause, and His Word, "Touch not My anointed, and do My Prophets
   no harm," had been a kind of shield to Israel in her earliest days.
   Though Abraham and others had, at times, gone forth to battle, nobody
   had fought with Israel since she had become a nation and, by mighty
   signs and wonders, had been delivered from the hand of Pharaoh and the
   bondage of Egypt. But Amalek was the first among the nations which
   dared to assail the chosen people of God and, therefore, a stern doom
   was decreed against him. He had heard what great things God had done
   for His people and yet he presumed to fight against them! And in so
   doing, he impiously lifted up his hand against Jehovah, Himself! He
   became the leader in this particular form of evil and thus assumed a
   fearful responsibility-- and assured to himself a terrible judgment.

   But the impiety was still worse, for Amalek went out of his way to
   attack Israel. The people had not come into his territory--they were a
   good way from it and were passing quietly by--but we read, "Then came
   Amalek." His envy was stirred up so much that he came away from his own
   region to fight with Israel without any provocation. Amalek was a
   descendant of Esau and the hate of Esau towards Jacob so burned in the
   breast of Amalek towards Israel that he came a long journey in order
   that he might at once, without proclaiming war, fall suddenly upon the
   hosts of Israel. Because the attack was thus wanton, he had to suffer
   the stern judgment of God. Let not wicked men imagine that because God
   is in Heaven and they are upon the earth they can, with impunity,
   oppose His people. "He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord
   shall have them in derision." Woe be to the man who wantonly attacks
   the saints of the Most High God! Be not disquieted, O child of God, if
   this is your case! "Fret not yourself because of evildoers, neither be
   you envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut
   down like the grass and wither as the green herb."

   Moreover, Amalek in this act went forth to fight against God, Himself.
   It was not with Israel, alone, that he warred--he also battled with
   Jehovah, the God of Israel. In the words of the 16th verse, as some
   translate them, Amalek had laid his hands upon the Throne of God and,
   therefore, God laid His own hand upon the Throne and swore by His
   Throne that He would uproot Amalek from among the nations. It was
   because the opposition to the Israelites was distinctly on account of
   God, Himself, that, therefore, Amalek had to be cut off. Dear Brothers
   and Sisters, you and I may be assailed by wicked men and we may
   distinctly trace the whole of it to their malice and to their enmity
   against God, Himself, but though that may be all true, yet we must not,
   therefore, be, ourselves, malicious towards them. Neither must we be
   proud, as though we were innocent and they, alone, were guilty.

   Wicked men nailed our Savior to the Cross, but His prayer for them was,
   "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." Dearly Beloved,
   if the ungodly hate you and persecute you, avenge not yourselves, but
   rather give way to wrath, for it is written, "Vengeance is Mine; I will
   repay, says the Lord." When you are persecuted for righteousness' sake,
   the Lord takes notice of it. "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" was
   the word which came from the excellent Glory to him who journeyed to
   Damascus, "breathing out threats and slaughter against the disciples of
   the Lord." When he persecuted them, he was really persecuting their
   Master! Be not, then, troubled if men revile you, persecute you and say
   all manner of evil against you falsely, for Christ's sake, but rather,
   "Rejoice and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in Heaven:
   for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you." Leave the
   issue with the Lord--the battle is His and He will, in His own time and
   way, overthrow all His and your adversaries.

   Let us now turn our thoughts to the other aspect of this subject. The
   guilt of ungodly men in persecuting God's people is not inconsistent
   with my next statement, that assaults upon us may also arise from our
   own sins. We may have brought the evil upon ourselves and we had better
   look to it that there is not a sin of our own that lies at the root of
   what we suffer, for it was so with these people. When they had chided
   with Moses and murmured against God, "Then came

   Amalek."

   Israel had been quarrelling with God. Do you wonder, then, that other
   people quarreled with them? You may often read your sin in its
   punishment and, if you had prophetic eye enough, you might see your
   chastening in your offense. Many a time our severity to others is the
   reason for God's apparent severity with us. If we have withheld from
   the poor, we need not wonder if God withholds from us. And if we have
   been slow to forgive, we need not marvel if we do not soon get a sense
   of forgiveness for ourselves. We often urge people to do unto others as
   we would that they should do unto us. Let me reverently say another
   thing--do unto God as you would that God should do unto you, for, "with
   the froward God will show Himself froward." That ink with which we
   wrote the ill word, God will use in the writing down of our sentence.
   It was so in this case--Israel quarreled with God--and now Amalek
   quarrels with Israel.

   They put a question about God, "Is the Lord among us, or not?"--a
   horrible question, since it involved a doubt as to the veracity of
   Moses and as to the reality of all the great wonders which were worked
   in Egypt and in the wilderness! And, because they questioned God, God
   makes it a serious question between them and Amalek--a question which,
   for a while, seemed to be answered favorably, for Israel prevailed. But
   soon it was answered unfavorably, for Amalek prevailed. The conflicting
   hosts sway to and fro on the battlefield--first victors, then
   vanquished--again conquering, then once more conquered! How will the
   terrible struggle end? No wonder that God puts the issue in question,
   when they had put Him in question! If you question God, He will soon
   leave you to question yourselves. I do not wonder that men say, "Have I
   any faith?" when they begin to doubt the very Inspiration of Scripture!
   What is the good of having any faith when there is nothing left for you
   to believe? You may well fear to build upon that Scripture whose very
   foundations you have undermined! If we question God, God will make our
   safety a question--and we shall have a stern fight for it.

   Moreover, we find that Israel had uttered threats against Moses, so
   that he said, "They are almost ready to stone me." Now, if they would
   stone the man of God, is it at all amazing that the men of the world
   were ready to kill them? If you go against Moses, God will send Amalek
   against you, for remember that God chastens His people! Though He
   forgives, He chastens. And He chastens all the more because He
   forgives. He condemns us in our consciences, that He may not condemn us
   at the Judgement Seat. He afflicts us here, that we may not be
   destroyed with the world at the end! Now is the day of the Believer's
   chastisement for his benefit. By-and-by will be the time of the
   unbeliever's punishment which shall bring him no benefit, but shall be
   the just reward of his evil deeds. Child of God, do you wish to receive
   chastise-

   ment? You have only to go into sin and you may rest assured that you
   will not escape the rod! If you are a bastard, you may, perhaps, sin
   and prosper, but if you are a true-born child of God, you cannot sin
   without smarting for it--

   "Did I meet no trials here,

   No chastisement by the way,

   Might I not, with reason, fear

   I should provea castaway?

   Bastards may escape the rod,

   Sunk in earthly vain delight;

   But the true-born child of God

   Must not, would not if he might." So there is our first point. We may
   sometimes justly charge our afflictions upon the evil intent of ungodly
   men and yet, at the same time, we may have to also charge them upon
   ourselves. It may be equally true that we have procured them by our own
   slips and stumbling in the ways of the Lord, as that evil men have
   wickedly raised their hands against us. So, when attacks are made upon
   us, let us be more careful to search our own hearts and examine our own
   lives, than to condemn the faults of other men. To their God they will
   have to render their own account.

   II. In the second place, let us think of INSTRUMENTALITY IN ITS DOUBLE
   RELATION. Here, again, another contrast is to be found in the text and
   its connection. If you will notice, in the fifth verse, God says to
   Moses, "Take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, with which
   you smote the river." But when Moses talks about the rod, in the ninth
   verse, which forms our text, he says, "Tomorrow I will stand on the top
   of the hill with the rod of God in my hand." In both verses it is the
   same rod which is spoken of. God calls it the rod of Moses. Moses calls
   it the rod of God and both these expressions are true. I want you to
   remember that. The first is true--it is the rod of Moses--that is the
   human side. And in this connection it is sometimes called the rod of
   Moses and sometimes the rod of Aaron. But the Divine side is just as
   noticeable and then it is called the rod of God. With reference to the
   instrumentality which God is pleased to use, we must thus remember its
   twofold nature and look on both sides of the shield.

   One side is that God calls it the rod of Moses and so honors Moses.
   Wherever there is an opportunity of doing honor to the faith of His own
   servants, God is never slow to use it! He is a King who delights to
   give glory to His warriors when they behave themselves bravely in the
   heat of battle. It gives Him pleasure to knight them on the field and
   let them know that they have done well. At the end He will say to those
   who have been valiant for His cause, "Well done, good and faithful
   servants." Even here He gives His chosen a foretaste of that full
   approval which will make their Heaven complete. God is not afraid of
   spoiling His people by saying a good word about them. You remember the
   story of the man who had a good wife and one said to him, "Why, she is
   worth her weight in gold." "Yes," he said, "she is worth a Gibraltar
   rock in gold, but I never tell her that. You know that it is necessary
   to maintain discipline and if I were to tell her how much I really
   value her, she would not know herself."

   Well, now, that is wrong! It does people good to be told how highly we
   value them. There is many a Christian man and woman who would do better
   if, now and then, someone would speak a kindly word to them and let
   them know that they had done well. God Himself gives us an example of
   this, for He, here, puts honor on His servant, by saying to Moses,
   "Your rod, with which you smote the river, take in your hand, and go."
   Moses was the instrument whom God used against Pharaoh and though his
   rod was, in itself, only a common stick, yet it was Moses who used the
   rod and it was really that rod with which he smote the river. God
   actually did use him and it is not God's way to use a man and then say
   nothing about it. God ascribes to Moses what Moses really did! We must
   never despise the instrumentality which God uses. The tendency of our
   nature is to run to the other extreme and to rest in instrumentality.
   We often need to remember that word, "Cursed be the man that trusts in
   man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the Lord."
   But in trying to avoid that rock, we must not run on the other and
   slight all instrumentality. God will have His servants esteemed and, if
   He puts honor upon them, we cannot be wrong if He also honors them.

   Moreover, it really was the rod of Moses and would not so well have
   fitted any other hand. God does not put into a position of influence a
   man unfit for the post. Even Moses did not work wonders with the rod
   until he had renounced the riches of Egypt and borne the burden of life
   in the wilderness. There was a fitness in the fact of the rod being in
   the hand of such a man. He had no rod when, in his fleshly energy, he
   slew the Egyptian whom he found oppressing the Hebrew slave. Had it
   then been in his hand, what sad havoc he might have made! But now he
   used it as God directed. In fact, the

   rod was the symbol of his authority and that authority was not bestowed
   upon him until he was qualified to exercise it! Thus, in a very real
   sense, it was the rod of Moses. In addition to this, it was the faith
   of Moses which gave power to his rod--he, himself, was the conductor of
   the Divine energy. Had the rod been wielded by another man,
   self-appointed and lacking the confidence which Moses had come to
   possess in God, it would have been simply a powerless stick. But
   because of his authority and because of his faith, it was right to call
   it, "the rod of Moses." When a man is evidently used of God, let us be
   quick to recognize the special qualities which render him worthy to be
   used, and let us esteem him very highly in love for his work's sake.
   Thus we see that God calls the almond branch, which did such wonders in
   Egypt and at the Red Sea, the rod of Moses.

   On the other hand, Moses calls it the rod of God and so honors God. He
   whom God uses, gives God the praise, for God is always the source of
   our strength. And if any work is done that is worth doing, unto Him
   must be ascribed all the glory! It was not in his own might that Moses
   turned the waters of the Nile into blood and caused the fish to die. It
   was not by any power inherent in himself that he made the dust of Egypt
   to live and become a terrible plague to the people. It was not by any
   human magic that Moses divided the Red Sea and made a way for the
   ransomed nation to march through its depths. No one knew better than he
   that the instrument that branded the breast of the Red Sea and left a
   dry mark where it fell, was the rod of God, not man's! It is He, alone,
   that does great wonders, and unto His name be all the praise! 'Won
   nobis, Domine," must always be our Psalm of adoration unto
   Jehovah--"Not unto us, O Lord; not unto us, but unto Your name, give
   glory."

   Let us learn, from these words of Moses, that instrumentality is not to
   be decried or despised, for God uses it. But the instrument must never
   be allowed to usurp the place of God, for it must be always remembered
   that it is God who uses it. The axe must not exalt itself against him
   that cuts with it, but, when there are trees to be felled, it would be
   folly to throw the axe away! The net must not be made a god that we may
   sacrifice to it, but it would be idle to go fishing without a net! Use
   your agencies and your instrumentalities to the very fullest extent,
   but understand that it is God that works in you, and God that works by
   you, if anything is accomplished that is worthy of record.

   Thus I have given you two sets of things in which it is easy enough to
   blunder if you shut one of your eyes, or if you only look at them in
   one light--first, the persecution of God's people and, secondly, the
   instrumentality used in God's service.

   III. And now, for a third thing. Behold, in this incident, PRUDENCE IN
   ITS DOUBLE ACTIVITY. You have that

   in the text. Moses said unto Joshua, "Choose us out men and go out,
   fight with Amalek." To which Joshua might have replied, "Yes, I will
   gladly do that, and you will go, too, Moses, and fight, will you not?"
   No, no, he will not! "Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with
   the rod of God in my hand." You see, as Oliver Cromwell would have put
   it, prudence trusts in God and keeps its powder dry. Prudence prays
   with Moses while it fights with Joshua. In like manner, in the
   activities of our holy faith, we must learn to balance work and
   worship, prayer for victory and conflict with the enemy. In the case
   before us, we see that the means are not neglected. Moses did not call
   all the people to pray when it was time for fighting! He prayed, but at
   the same time he set the battle in array. This is true wisdom, for,
   "faith without works is dead." We cannot expect to have souls saved if
   we pray and never preach! We cannot expect to have our children saved
   if we only pray for them night and morning, and never speak to them
   about eternal matters, and do not instruct them in the things of God.
   The means must not be neglected!

   Observe how Moses prepared to fight the Amalekites. He said to Joshua,
   "Choose us out men." He did not lose sight of the necessity of having
   the most fit warriors because his trust was in God. If someone, seeing
   only one side of the question, had come to him, and said, "The battle
   is the Lord's, why do you want to pick out men? Will not one man do as
   well as another?" Moses would probably have replied, "These Amalekites
   are mighty warriors. Take chosen men--men that are able-bodied--men
   that are expert in war, the choicest men you can find, and go to war
   with Amalek. We shall need our best men to overcome such a foe. Choose
   us out men."

   This is a rule without exception when you go to work for Christ--bring
   forth the best of everything that you have--your best thought, your
   best knowledge, your best ability! Let the Church always see to it that
   she tries to get the best men she can to fight the battles of the Lord.
   It is a mistake to suppose that just anybody will do for Christian
   work. Christ may use whom He wills, even the weakest things and the
   things that are despised--but as for us, we must always

   look to that which is most adapted to the work, most suitable for it,
   always hearkening to the words of Moses to Joshua, "Choose us out men."

   The leader was also chosen--"Moses said unto Joshua." He did not pick
   up the first youth that he met and say to him, "Go and fight these
   Amalekites," but he took the man whom God had fitted for the post of
   leader in the war, even Joshua, and said to him, "Go out and fight with
   Amalek." It is well for us, in carrying on the work and warfare for
   God, to rally round those whom God has qualified to be leaders. Means
   are not to be neglected, nor may God's work be done in a slovenly
   style. Choose you out men and let the leader of them be a choice man,
   the man of God's choice.

   The time for the battle was also chosen. "Tomorrow I will stand on the
   top of the hill." Why not tonight, Moses? These Amalekites have just
   been falling upon you. Why not fight them at once? Well, because the
   people were not ready. It would take a little time to get the fighting
   men in order. Tomorrow was quite soon enough. Besides, Moses felt by
   instinct that he would fight these children of the wilderness best when
   he could see them--not by night, when they knew the way better than he
   did--but by daylight. To those of you who earnestly desire to serve
   God, I would say--Do not be in too great a hurry, lest your indiscreet
   zeal should bring disaster upon you. "He that believes shall not make
   haste." Choose the best time! Serve God wisely. Go about the work as if
   all depended upon you--and then trust in God, knowing that all depends
   upon Him! Use the same foresight, the same judgment, the same care that
   you would use if it were solely your own work. And then, when you have
   done that, fall back upon God, feeling that all your care and all your
   foresight will be in vain unless He stretches forth His hand to help
   and to ensure success!

   Note, again, that the battle was most real. Moses did not say, "Choose
   you out men and go and drive Amalek away like a flock of sheep." No,
   but, "Go out and fight with Amalek." Believe me, Brothers and Sisters,
   we make a great mistake if we think that this world is to be conquered
   for Christ without mighty efforts. Some talk as if the expenditure of a
   few pounds and the going forth of a few men will end the whole war. It
   will do nothing of the sort! If nations are to be subdued to Christ,
   His Church must exert all her power. All her power without Him is
   nothing, but if He chooses to use her power, He will have the whole of
   it brought into use before He gives the blessing! "Choose us out men,
   and go out, fight with Amalek." When the battle began, it was no
   child's play! It was a hand-to-hand conflict, a struggle for life or
   death, and the end of it was that, "Joshua vanquished Amalek and his
   people with the edge of the sword." Not merely by praying, but, "with
   the edge of the sword." Moses on the hilltop is doing his part by
   holding up the rod--but you must have Joshua down below with the sharp
   edge of the sword, or else Amalek will laugh at the prayers of Moses! I
   should like to have this rule written on every man's mind, that if he
   is to serve God, and get a blessing from God, he must have both the
   prayer of Moses and the sword of Joshua!

   But, on the other hand, in this battle, reliance on God is not
   neglected. Moses ascends the hill holding up his ban-ner--and that
   banner is the rod of God. The staff on which God's servant had been
   accustomed to lean, God had blessed, and made it to be a scepter, the
   sign of His royal Presence and a wonder-working thing in the land!
   Moses holds this up. The banner is the rod of God and the banner-bearer
   is the chosen servant of God. Everything on Israel's side is of God--
   Moses and Joshua are ordained of God and the rod chosen of Moses is, at
   the same time, the rod of God! This is held up where all the people can
   see it and every warrior, as he turns his eyes, can behold that rod of
   God which had worked such wonders before, still held aloft above the
   conflicting armies! When Moses' hands are heavy, the symbol of God's
   Presence need not be lowered, for Aaron and Hur are at hand to hold up
   his arms. Israel is continually reminded of the interest of God in the
   battle against Amalek. The rod in the hand of Moses seems to say, "God
   is fighting for you! God's servant is holding up the appointed
   standard!" Undoubtedly that assurance must have largely aided them to
   go through the battle with a brave heart. The meaning of it would be
   clear--"Fight, but trust. War with Amalek with the edge of the sword,
   but prevail over Amalek by prevailing with God in prayer."

   Unfortunately, in our work for God, we generally fall into one of two
   blunders. Either we get a lot of machinery and think that we shall
   accomplish everything by that, or else we are like some whom I have
   known, who have confided so much in prayer that they have done nothing
   but pray! Prayer is a downright mockery if it does not lead us into the
   practical use of means likely to promote the ends for which we pray. I
   have known friends take medicine when they have been ill and never pray
   about their sickness. There are some others who pray about their
   sickness, but never take the proper medicine. They are both wrong! You
   must have Joshua and you must have Moses, too, in the time of trial! Go
   before God

   with your sickness, but if there is an appointed means that has been
   made useful to others, use it, for God will bless you by the use of
   means.

   Try to see two sides of a thing. Do not trust exclusively to either one
   or the other. It is a very heinous fault to trust the means without
   God, but, though it is a much smaller fault to trust in God and not use
   the means, yet still it is a fault. Practical prudence will lead you to
   do both. It gives to Joshua his sword, that he may make it red with the
   blood of the enemy and it gives to Moses his rod, that he may go with
   it up to the top of the hill and hold it up there in the sight of the
   people--that all may know that the battle is the Lord's--and that He
   will deliver the enemy into their hands. God make you wise in these
   things and enable you to use both the rod of God and the sword of man!

   IV. I have to speak of one other Truth and then I am done. Behold here,
   in a wondrous type, CHRIST IN HIS TWOFOLD CAPACITY. Christ is
   represented to us here as Moses on the hill, pleading, and as Joshua in
   the valley, fighting!

   Learn, first, that Christ is pleading for us. He is not here. He is
   risen and He has ascended to the right hand of God, even the Father,
   and there He is making intercession for His people. It is because He
   intercedes for us that we win the victory! Cannot your faith's eyes see
   Him now, on the top of the hill, with the rod of God in His hand, with
   all power given to Him in Heaven and in earth, pleading with authority
   before the great Throne of Jehovah? Here is the secret of our strength!
   He never fails. He never needs to sit down upon a stone, nor does He
   need any to hold up His hands because they grow weary. No, blessed be
   His name, He pleads and prevails from generation to generation--and
   will continue to do so until He shall descend from Heaven a second time
   to complete the victory of His people! In His mediation is our
   confidence.

   But, then, do not forget that He is also warring for us. He is here,
   though I have just said that He is not here. In one sense He is gone
   and in another sense He remains. On the very eve of His departure, He
   said, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." And
   His promise is forever true, "Where two or three are gathered together
   in My name, there am I in the midst of them." So, though He has gone
   into Glory, He is yet here in a spiritual sense by the Holy Spirit--He
   is His Lieutenant, who takes the Kingdom and presides over it, and
   works in it on behalf of King Jesus. He is that "other Comforter" whom
   the Lord Jesus promised to send to His disciples. And so, though Christ
   has ascended, that blessed Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, has taken His
   place and, by the Holy Spirit, Christ is still here! We need not pray
   for the Holy Spirit to be poured out. He never will be poured out,
   again, since He was once poured out at Pentecost and is still here! You
   may very properly ask to be baptized into the Holy Spirit if you desire
   to know His power to the fullest and you may go down into His
   influences till you are immersed therein, but how can we ask that the
   Spirit should again be poured out, when He has not gone back to Heaven?
   He came down once and here He stays. "He shall abide with you forever."
   This is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit and, in Him, Christ is
   always with us, our greater Joshua, fighting for the people whom He
   will one day lead into the Promised Land, the heavenly Canaan!

   I think that I see our Joshua now, sword in hand, chasing our
   adversaries. And I turn my eyes upward and see our Moses, rod in hand,
   pleading for His people. Let us see Him in both capacities and thank
   God that Christ is All--not one type of the Law, but all the types--not
   one of the ceremonials, but all the ceremonials, and all the shadows
   melting into one great substance! Glory be to His name! Believe in
   Christ in Heaven and trust Him with your prayers! Believe in Christ on
   earth--range yourself on His side and rest assured that no foe will be
   able to stand against Him! He is on the battlefield, today, and in the
   thickest of the fray! When His own people are driven back and His
   adversaries begin to rejoice, friends and foes, alike, shall yet prove
   the power of His almighty arm! "Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O most
   Mighty, with Your glory and Your majesty; and in Your majesty ride
   prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and Your
   right hand shall teach You terrible things."--

   "Fight for Yourself, O Jesus, fight, The travail of Your soul regain."

   So, you see that though two things may look contradictory, they are
   often both really true, and are both different sides of one shield.
   Try, then, to always see both sides of every Truth of God revealed in
   the Scriptures. Divine Truths often resemble tramcars which travel upon
   two lines of iron, and yet the two lines make but one tramway. The
   lines are parallel and do not touch each other. How could the car
   travel if they did? This is the Truth of God--it is but one Truth--but
   it has two sides which run parallel to each other. Do not try to join
   them, nor take them up and make them cross each other, but travel along
   them till you come to the great terminus above.

   God bless you, if you are His people! If not, all is wrong. Oh, may you
   now trust the living Christ! He is here, ready to hear your cry for
   mercy! He is there in Glory, ready to plead your cause. He waits to be
   gracious to sinners here below. He waits in Heaven till His enemies
   shall be made His footstool. May you bow before the silver scepter of
   His mercy, that you may not be broken in pieces by the iron rod of His
   justice--and may the Lord be with you all! Amen.

The Best Donation

   (No. 2234)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 13, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   5, 1891.

   "And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave themselves to the
   Lord, and unto us by the will of God." 2 Corinthians 8:5.

   HERE we see the Apostle Paul disappointed, though he was never
   discontented. God had taught him how to abound and how to suffer need.
   In the School of Grace he had learned contentment, but at this time he
   had met with disappointment. Things had not happened as he thought they
   should have done and now he tells the Corinthians how the Churches of
   Macedonia have disappointed him. "This they did, not as we hoped."

   Paul's disappointment, too, was concerning money, although that was a
   thing the Apostle never cared about at all. He never lived with any
   idea of gain--he held it almost in contempt. Yet here he is
   disappointed about money matters and he is writing of his
   disappointment. But do not run away with a mistaken idea of what Paul
   meant. Though this is one of the many unexpected things which happened
   to him, it is different in its character from most of his other
   disappointments. His expectations were not realized on this occasion
   because they were exceeded! He was disappointed with the Churches of
   Macedonia because they did a great deal more than he ever expected them
   to do. "This they did," he says, "not as we hoped." He had only hoped
   that they would give a little, for they were not rich people--and a
   little would show their generosity to the poor saints in Jerusalem. And
   he was ready to make much of that little and thank God that they were
   willing to remember those who were more in need than themselves. But
   they went far beyond anything he expected of them. Paul bore record
   that their liberality was up to the utmost limit of their power, "yes,
   and beyond their power." A little from them would have been more than a
   much larger sum from richer people. Our gifts are not to be measured by
   the amount we contribute, but by the surplus kept in our own hands. The
   two mites of the widow were, in Christ's eyes, worth more than all the
   other money cast into the treasury, for, "she of her want did cast in
   all that she had, even all her living."

   Not only did those Macedonian Believers give much, but they gave it
   willingly. "They were willing of themselves." This added fragrance to
   their gift. They needed no pressing or urging--the Apostle did not have
   to organize a "Fancy Fair" to wheedle the money out of them, nor even
   to preach loud and long to awaken them to their duty. "They were
   willing of themselves." I thank God that you, my people, have always
   abounded in "the same Grace, also." Still, what we have done is nothing
   compared to the need which lies before us. May those who have, up to
   now, been ready to bestow their goods, be found even more willing now
   to contribute to the cause of God and generously give towards the
   spread of the Gospel, the education of ministers and the needs of the
   orphans! Let there be no necessity laid upon you except the sweet
   compulsion of love, remembering that "God loves a cheerful giver."

   But these Macedonians gave more than money--they gave themselves. Paul
   writes, "They first gave themselves to the Lord, and unto us by the
   will of God." This was the best donation--better, even, than the two
   mites of the poor widow. She gave her living, but they gave their
   lives, their very being! They also gave the best donation in the best
   way. They did not stop with giving themselves to the Lord, they also
   gave themselves to the Lord's people. This is the will of God, that
   those who yield themselves up to Him should join those who are already
   His.

   In speaking to you concerning these Churches of Macedonia, I would say,
   first, that these people are an example to us in several particulars.
   And when I have spoken a little upon that subject, I will say, in the
   second place, Let us follow their example.

   I. First, then, THESE PEOPLE ARE AN EXAMPLE TO US. The Grace of God
   seems to have been so largely bestowed upon them that they, of whom but
   little was expected, sprang at once into the chief place of honor.
   Sometimes we see this in Churches today--poor and despised communities
   suddenly excel all their Brothers and Sisters. "The lame take the
   prey." The great works of the world are not done by the great people of
   the world, but as the tiny coral insects, patiently working unseen,
   produce large results, it often happens that the weakest Brothers and
   Sisters bestow a large legacy of blessing upon us! This was the case in
   Macedonia--"The abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded
   unto the riches of their liberality." As an ounce of example is worth a
   pound of precept, let us study the conduct of those early Christians
   very carefully.

   First, they are an example because they followed the right order. They
   did the first thing, first. Paul says, concerning them, "This they did,
   not as we hoped, but first gave themselves to the Lord." You know that
   it spoils even good things when you reverse the right order in which
   they should be done and, as we commonly say, put the cart before the
   horse. Did you ever hear of the servant who was told to go and sweep a
   room and then dust it, who went and dusted the room and then swept it?
   She did not obey her orders because she did not observe the right
   order. Her work might as well have been left undone! Great mischief
   always comes of departing from God's method in spiritual things. When
   the Lord tells you to believe and be baptized, if you are baptized,
   first, and believe afterwards, you have upset the Scriptural order and
   have practically disobeyed it! You have not kept to God's Word at all.
   There is nothing like doing the right thing in the right order. Do what
   Christ tells you and do it as Christ tells you. These Macedonian
   Believers put the first thing, first. They first gave themselves to the
   Lord and afterwards they gave themselves to the Church of God!

   This is the first thing, because it is of the first importance. If you
   are Christ's, join Christ's people. But the first thing is, see to it
   that you are Christ's! Yield yourself unto Him. Trust in Him. This is
   the first thing and everything else is a poor second in comparison with
   it. Dear Friend, have you given yourself to the Lord? Can you truly
   say, "I am my Lord's, and He is mine. I have, by His Grace, made sure
   of that"? Especially you young people who are just starting out in
   life--let this be your prime care. May God give you Grace to yield
   yourself to Christ even now, before you meet the fiercer temptations of
   the world! Stand still and consider the matter, and say, "I will now
   unreservedly yield myself to Him who died for me--

   'Now that my journey's just begun, My course so little trod; I'll stay
   before I further run, And give myself to God."

   Yielding ourselves to the Lord comes first and thus makes the second
   thing valid. If it does not come first, the second is good for nothing!
   If a man gives himself to the Church, he must not, therefore, suppose
   that he has given himself to God. To give himself to the people of God,
   before giving himself, first, to God, will do the man no good. It will,
   indeed, do him a positive injury. The man who acts in this way is
   either self-deceived, or else a deceiver--he does wrong to God, to the
   Church, to himself and is thus a threefold offender! You have no right
   to either of the ordinances of Christ if you do not belong to Him--they
   are only for Believers--and until you first give yourself to the Lord,
   you have no right to be reckoned among the people of God! If you come
   to the Lord's Table as an unbeliever, so far from getting any good
   there, you will eat and drink condemnation to yourself, for you cannot
   discern the Lord's body and, therefore, you cannot rightly use the
   bread and cup which are the emblems of His broken body and poured out
   blood. Dear Friend, do that first thing, first! First give yourself to
   the Lord and then give yourself to us by the will of God!

   This is the first thing, again, because it leads to the second. I do
   not think that those Macedonians would ever have thought of giving
   themselves up to the Church if they had not first given themselves up
   to God, for in those days, you know, to join the Christian Church meant
   enduring shame, persecution and frequently death! They had to steal
   away by night to the private assemblies of the saints--and if they
   joined the Church and it was once known--there would probably soon be
   the cry, "Christians to the lions!" And they would be taken to the
   amphitheatre, first to be exhibited, and then to be devoured by wild
   beasts!

   Men did not care about joining Christian Churches in those days unless
   they first gave themselves to the Lord. The persecution of the early
   Christians was a wonderful means of keeping the Churches pure. Church
   officers, then, did not need to examine those who sought fellowship
   with them as we are obliged to do, for not many were likely to present
   themselves unless they loved their Lord and His Gospel better than
   life, itself. But even then some hypocrites did profess

   to be the Lord's people, though their heart was far from Him. In these
   soft and silken days I would be the more earnest in saying to you--Do
   not give yourselves to us. Do not think of joining any Christian
   Church, until, first of all, you have given yourselves to the Lord.
   Make a very searching enquiry into your own spiritual state before you
   offer yourself as a candidate for Church fellowship. Many of you do
   this. I have been struck, again and again, with the fact that the
   results of our special services in this place are not garnered quickly.
   Sometimes people come in numbers to join us who trace their first
   impulse to some special effort put forth here a year or two before. I
   fear that many wait too long, but there should be no undue haste in the
   matter. Make sure that, first, you are the Lord's--then come and be
   baptized, confessing your faith. Now, do you trust Christ? Have you
   become Christ's servant? Have you taken His Cross upon your shoulders
   to bear it after Him? Then come and welcome, and join with His people!
   But you must not do it until, first, you are the Lord's.

   These Macedonians are examples, next, because they were free in what
   they did. They "first gave themselves to the Lord, and unto us by the
   will of God." They did not come to God by compulsion. There was a
   gentle pressure put upon them by the Holy Spirit, which made them
   willing in the day of God's power--and they willingly and cheerfully
   gave themselves up to God. Are you doing so, dear Friend? Is your
   religion a thing which has been impressed upon you by your
   surroundings, by your Christian friends, or by the demands of society?
   Such a religion is not worth having! To be truly the Lord's, there must
   be a voluntary giving up of yourself to Him and to His service. You
   must be able to say--

   "'Tis done! The great transaction's done;

   I am my Lord's, and He is mine;

   He drew me, and I followed on,

   Charmed to confess the voice Divine." Then you will be able to sing the
   chorus at the end of it--

   "Happy day! Happy day,"

   and you will not feel it to be a misery to have given yourself up to
   God, but your soul's greatest delight! And so be like those who gave
   themselves to the Lord and did it cheerfully and freely.

   They gave themselves, also, wholly and unreservedly. This is proved by
   the fact that their money followed the gift of themselves. The
   dedication of their persons was followed by the consecration of their
   purses. It was no half-hearted offering of a languid devotion, but a
   real and practical yielding up of every bit of their being to be
   entirely and forever the Lord's. Now, this is the sort of conversion
   that delights both God and His people--when the whole man is all aflame
   with love to Christ--when there is no attempt to compromise matters, or
   to keep back any part of that which is the Lord's. When we are able
   truthfully to sing--

   "Take my life, and let it be

   Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.

   Take my silver and my gold,

   Not a mite would I withhold.

   Take myself, and I will be

   Always, only, all for Thee."

   These Macedonians were so eager to be out-and-out for Christ that they,
   without any constraint, gave themselves to His people. I delight to see
   young Believers coming forward promptly and cheerfully, feeling, "Yes,
   I belong to Christ, and I should like to join those who also belong to
   Him." To have it pressed upon you by one and another and to be urged to
   do it almost spoils it. I think that it is with our gift of ourselves
   to Christ and His people as it is with plucking a peach--if it is
   handled much, or pulled off the tree by a rough grasp of the hand--the
   beautiful bloom is quickly gone from it. Christ loves to have our
   hearts with the bloom on them! He delights to see us willingly yielding
   ourselves!

   I remember the difficulty that I had, when I was converted and wished
   to join the Christian Church in the place where I lived. I called upon
   the minister four successive days before I could see him. Each time
   there was some obstacle in the way of an interview and, as I could not
   see him at all, I wrote and told him that I would go down to the Church
   Meeting and propose myself as a member. He looked upon me as a strange
   character, but I meant what I said, for I felt that I could not be
   happy without fellowship with the people of God. I needed to be
   wherever they were and if anybody ridiculed them, I wished to be
   ridiculed with them. And if people had an ugly name for them, I wanted
   to be called by that ugly name, for I felt that unless I suffered with
   Christ in His humiliation, I could not expect to reign with Him in His

   Glory. Beloved Friends, give yourselves, first, to God and afterwards
   to His Church, as these people did, cheerfully and promptly, without
   pressure or excitement. They came forward, not even as the Apostle
   hoped, but they went beyond all that!

   In the third place, these people are good examples, not only in
   following the right order and doing it willingly, but because they had
   a sense of obedience in both. What they did, they did because they
   found that it was "the will of God." It was the calm decision of hearts
   made sensitive by the Holy Spirit. Their faith was a living one and
   produced these good fruits. They were not carried away by emotion, but
   led by reason and conscience to give all to Him who deserved more than
   all they could give.

   They felt that it was right to give themselves first to the Lord. They
   said, "How can we do otherwise? Christ has bought us with His blood--we
   must give ourselves to Him. God has chosen us from before the
   foundation of the world--we must choose Him. The Holy Spirit has
   renewed us. This new nature of ours must belong to Him. We are God's by
   election, by creation, by Providence, by redemption, by new creation,
   by adoption--and His we will be forever and ever." They felt that they
   could not do otherwise, but must be wholly the Lord's because of what
   the Lord had done for them. This is the Apostle's argument when He
   says, "For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge that
   if One died for all, then were all dead: and that He died for all, that
   they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
   Him which died for them, and rose again." I wish that, under the sweet
   constraint of Divine Love, many of you might be led at once to give
   yourselves to the Lord!

   Well, then, they felt the same thing about giving themselves to the
   Apostle and giving themselves to the Church! They said, "We will give
   ourselves up to this Apostle who has brought the Word of the Lord to
   us. He shall lead us. He has been a messenger from God to us--we will
   let him be our captain. What he bids us do, we will do, for we are
   persuaded that he is a man of God and he seeks not himself, nor ours,
   but us! He seeks to glorify God by leading us to nobler deeds of Grace
   and to greater heights of excellence. We will give ourselves to him and
   to the Church." Surely, dear Friend, if a man of God has been used to
   bring you out of darkness into Christ's marvelous light, you may well
   feel that such a man shall still lead you on! As long as he is faithful
   to his Master, you may very naturally and gladly be faithful to him.
   "They first gave themselves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of
   God."

   They also had a sense of obedience in helping the poor, especially the
   poor saints, and, most of all, the poor saints at Jerusalem. Perhaps,
   mindful of that ancient promise, "Blessed is he that considers the
   poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble," they recognized
   that the care of those in poverty and distress was specially pleasing
   to Him to whom they had given themselves. For that reason they would
   gladly make their contribution to the utmost limit of their power.
   Doubtless, they had heard the word that the Lord Jesus spoke to His
   disciples, "You have the poor with you always, and whenever you will,
   you may do them good: but Me you have not always," and as they could
   not directly bestow their goods on Christ, they willingly bestowed
   them, out of love to Him, upon the poor who knew His name! If we cannot
   give gold and silver to the Head of the Church in Heaven, we may help
   His poor members on earth. The reception of Christ into the heart and
   the yielding of the life to His sway has always been fruitful of
   beneficence to the poor.

   Zacchaeus has not been the only one who, when he received Christ, has
   said, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor." Some
   men, today, in their zeal for the poor, deliberately shut their eyes to
   this fact that before the time of Christ the poor were left to their
   hard lot--and that any alleviation which has come to them has come from
   disciples of the lowly Jesus who was so poor that He had not where to
   lay His head. Christ is the poor man's truest Friend--and those who
   give themselves to Christ must always see to it that they also give of
   their substance to the poor and thus lay up "treasure in Heaven."

   Paul distinctly states that these Macedonian Christians gave themselves
   to the Church "by the will of God." Beloved, it is the will of God that
   you who love Him should be numbered with His people. It is for your
   comfort. It is for your growth. It is for your preservation. If you
   belong to Christ, you should belong to Christ's Church. You already owe
   something to the Church. By its means, the preaching of the Gospel has
   been kept alive in the world. Through its preaching you have been
   converted. Through someone of its members you were brought to Jesus'
   feet. It is your duty and the Church's due that you should give
   yourself to the Church by the will of God! Think it over and see if it
   is not so. I say not that you should join this Church. You may be quite
   a stranger to us, but there is a place where God has fed your soul.
   There is a company of people somewhere, among whom you have often been
   taken up to Heaven's gate. There is an as-

   sembly where you first of all found the Savior. Go, I pray you, and, by
   the will of God, give yourself to that Church, as you have given
   yourself to Christ.

   You cannot tell the joy I have had today in visiting one who is lying
   grievously ill. My dear friend, in talking with me just now, as I sat
   by his bedside, said to me, "Pastor, do you remember what you said to
   me when you baptized me?" I said, "No, I do not." "Well," he said, it
   was 35 years ago, and when I was stepping into the water, you said,
   'Let us praise God for this, Brother. I hope He will make you a gift, a
   precious gift, to this Church.' And then you stopped before you
   baptized me, and said, 'Lord, make him useful, grant him Grace to serve
   You for many years to come!' It was 35 years ago," he said, "and yet I
   remember it as if it were but yesterday, how you prayed for me, and how
   you finished up by saying, 'And, when your feet shall touch the cold
   waters of the river of death, may you find it firm beneath you!' Oh,
   dear Pastor," he said, "it IS firm beneath my feet! I was never so
   happy or so joyful as I am now, in the expectation of soon beholding
   the face of Him I love."

   Our Brother also added, "How little does modern theology supply to a
   man on the brink of eternity! I want no theories about Inspiration, or
   about the Atonement. The Word of God is true to me from beginning to
   end and the precious blood of Jesus is my only hope." I said to him,
   "My brother said to me, the other day, what John Wesley said to
   Charles. He said, 'Brother, our people die well.'" "Yes," my friend who
   is ill answered, "they do, for as an elder of the Church, I have
   visited very many, and they always die with sure and confident faith."
   I never see a doubt in any of our friends when they come to die! I have
   more doubts than they seem to have. Alas, that it should be so! But I
   expect to play the man when I die, as they do, resting in that same
   Savior! But, Brothers and Sisters, we would have been great losers if
   that Brother had not, 35 years ago, having given himself to the Lord,
   also given himself to me and to the Church over which the Lord had made
   me overseer. Blessed be God, who has kept him and us even to this day!

   Thus you see that these people of Macedonia are an example to us.

   II. Secondly--and this I will urge very strongly on you all--LET US
   FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE. What use can we make of that example if we do not
   follow it? Let us make those Philippians, who are now citizens of a
   better city, glad when they hear that some, even in this 19th Century,
   were fired by their example to yield self and substance to their Lord
   and ours--to give all to Him who is the King of the country where they
   now have their blessed abode and where every man who now gives himself
   to Christ shall also reign with Him! Do you think that, if they came
   back to earth, they would behave differently? Do you think that they
   would give less, now, that they know their Lord more? No! Had they a
   chance of living here, again, they would even more willingly yield
   themselves and more ungrudgingly give of their substance to their dear
   Lord and Master!

   First, imitate their example in this particular--give yourself to the
   Lord. You who have done it, do it again! And you who have, up till this
   moment, kept back that which He claims, make a full surrender right
   now! Do not wait to make yourself better, or to feel better, but, just
   as you are, determine to be His and to be His forever! Say, "I do now,
   first of all give myself to You. I trust in the death of Christ as my
   only hope of eternal life and I give myself up to Him, believing that
   He will save me. There are many reasons why I should do this, but the
   chief reason is that Jesus gave Himself for me--shall I not, then, give
   myself to Him 'who loved me, and gave Himself for me'? What is there
   that I should like to keep back? I know of nothing. No, let Him take
   all."--

   "Savior! Your dying love You gave me--

   Nor should I anything withhold, My Lord, from You. In love my soul
   would bow, My heart fulfill its vow, Some offering bring You now,
   Something for You."

   The best offering you can bring to Christ is yourself, for until you
   have given yourself to Him, He cannot accept any other offering at your
   hands. Unless you are really Christ's, you cannot be truly happy.
   Surely, this is a motive that will appeal to you! You wish to live a
   happy life, do you not? There is no happiness without holiness--and no
   holiness without faith in the Lord Jesus Christ! Give yourself to Him
   and He will make you holy and happy, too. True joy will never be yours
   until "the joy of the Lord is your strength." To abide in Christ is
   Heaven begun below. "Blessed are they that

   dwell in Your house: they will be still praising You." Those who know
   the Lord best, praise Him the most! Therefore would I urge you to give
   yourself to Him at this good hour.

   Furthermore, we are only safe as we are given up to Christ's keeping.
   Only His power can save us from our adversary the devil, who, "as a
   roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour." If you give
   yourself to the Lord, you will be "safe in the arms of Jesus." He will
   hold you despite all the assaults of your foes and none shall pluck you
   out of His hands, so that you may exultingly say with Paul, "I know
   whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep that
   which I have committed unto Him against that day."

   Some of us gave ourselves to Christ 40 years ago. Oh, how thankful I am
   that I can say, "Forty years ago"! Some of you came 30 years ago; some
   20; some ten. Some of you only gave yourselves to Christ quite lately,
   when my dear Brothers Fullerton and Smith were at the Tabernacle. Well,
   do you wish to run back? If any of you do, I know one who does not, but
   who says, "Lord, I come again, as if I never had come before, and my
   heart's desire is to be fully Yours, more entirely Yours than I have
   ever been! Take heart, and hands, and feet, and eyes, and ears, and
   tongue--take life, and will, and all my powers of body, mind, and soul!
   Take all I am, and all I have, and all I ever shall have--take it all,
   for it is all Yours!" Will you not say so? While I am speaking, say it
   in your own souls! These Macedonians, "first gave themselves to the
   Lord." May some do this for the first time, even now! Each one of them
   shall then be able to sing--

   "Oh, I am my Beloved's,

   And my Beloved's mine!

   He brings a poor vile sinner

   Into His 'house of wine.'

   I stand upon His merit--

   I know no other stand--

   Not even where Glory dwells

   In Immanuel's land."

   In the next place, follow this example and give yourself to the Church.
   You that are members of the Church have not found it perfect and I hope
   that you feel almost glad that you have not. If I had never joined a
   Church till I had found one that was perfect, I would never have joined
   one at all! And the moment I did join it, if I had found one, I should
   have spoiled it, for it would not have been a perfect Church after I
   had become a member of it. Still, imperfect as it is, it is the dearest
   place on earth to us--

   "My soul shall pray for Zion still, While life or breath remains; There
   my best friends, my kindred dwell, There God my Savior reigns."

   All who have first given themselves to the Lord, should, as speedily as
   possible, also give themselves to the Lord's people. How else is there
   to be a Church on the earth? If it is right for anyone to refrain from
   membership in the Church, it is right for everyone, and then the
   testimony for God would be lost to the world! As I have already said,
   the Church is faulty, but that is no excuse for your not joining it, if
   you are the Lord's. Nor need your own faults keep you back, for the
   Church is not an institution for perfect people, but a sanctuary for
   sinners saved by Grace, who, though they are saved, are still sinners
   and need all the help they can derive from the sympathy and guidance of
   their fellow Believers. The Church is the nursery for God's weak
   children where they are nourished and grow strong. It is the fold for
   Christ's sheep--the home for Christ's family.

   It is due to the minister that you should join some Christian Church.
   If the Lord has blessed you under our ministry, tell us. I think that I
   once told you the story, which I know to be accurate, of a Church
   clergyman, a sincere, earnest Brother, who had preached for years and,
   to the best of his knowledge, had never seen a conversion and,
   therefore, concluded that his ministry had been useless. On the day he
   was buried, a gentleman was observed to stand and weep much at his
   grave, and someone asked him why he did so. He said, "Nobody can tell
   what that man was to me. He led me from darkness into the Light of God
   and his word has been my comfort for years." Yet that gentleman had
   never told the minister! He had never spoken to him of the blessing he
   had received under his ministry and he had let the good man die under
   the impression that he had been useless! When someone told him how the
   clergyman had grieved over his apparent

   failure, he said, "Oh, I did not know that he felt like that! I wish
   that I had told him what a blessing his sermons were to

   me."

   Now, if we say anything foolish, or if we are reported to have said
   something silly which probably we never did say, we have plenty of
   friends to write and correct us, to whom we are greatly obliged, of
   course! But there are some who are so afraid that we might be puffed up
   that they will not tell us even though they get a blessing from us. At
   any rate, be just, be grateful and let the servant of God know that his
   Master has blessed his message to your soul.

   If it is not due to the minister that you should join the Church and
   help in its work, I think it is due to our fellow workers. Some of them
   are working for Christ with all their might and in the schools and
   elsewhere they are fainting for lack of helpers. Let me tell you what
   you are like. It is a hot autumn day and a man is reaping. The sweat
   pours from his face as he bonds to his task, and he fears that he will
   never get to the end of the field. And all the time you are pleasantly
   occupied leaning over a gate and saying to yourself, "That is an
   uncommonly good laborer." Or, perhaps, instead of doing that, you are
   saying, "Why, he does not handle the sickle properly! I could show him
   a better way of reaping." But as you never attempt to show us, we have
   only your own word to go by--and you must excuse us for being a little
   skeptical on the subject! The work of the Church is generally left to a
   few earnest folk. Is that right? Is it right that a few should do all
   the work, while many others, who profess to belong to Christ, are doing
   nothing at all? Let that not be your case--if you have given yourselves
   to the Lord, give yourselves to His Church--according to His will.

   Think again, what a lack of fellowship there will be if those who have
   given themselves to the Lord do not also give themselves to His people.
   Possibly you ask, "What should I gain by joining the Church?" That is a
   miserable question to ask! I will answer it by asking another--Do you
   know how much you will lose by not joining the Church? You will lose
   the satisfaction of having done your Lord's will. You will lose the joy
   of fellowship with your Brothers and Sisters in Christ. You will lose
   the opportunity of helping, by your example, the weak ones of the
   flock. Your question should not be, "What should I gain for myself?"
   but, "What can I do for others?" And the answer should be, "I will join
   the Church because this is the will of God and there I shall be of
   benefit to my fellow Christians."

   In the third place, you should follow the example of these Macedonian
   Believers and give yourself both to the Lord and to His Church. Put the
   two together and thus begin to place yourself wholly in the line of
   God's will. Joining the Church without being the Lord's, no matter from
   whatever motive it is done, is a course of action fraught with great
   danger to the soul, for none are more dead than those who only have a
   name to live. On the other hand, much blessing is missed if those who
   are the Lord's do not unite themselves with His people.

   If you have given yourself to the Lord, give yourself, next, to His
   people, that you may, with them, bear witness for Christ. Here is a
   certain number of people who, with all their faults, are the true
   followers of Christ. Join them and say, "I, too, am a follower of
   Christ." That is what membership with the Church means. It is as if you
   should say, "If the world is divided into two camps, I am on the side
   of King Jesus, and under His banner I will fight as one of those who
   bear witness to the Truths of God that He has revealed."

   Do it, next, to spread the Gospel. Everybody is needed in this service,
   today, for the clear light of the Gospel is sadly obscured in many
   places. We cannot all be preachers, for if all were preachers, where
   would be the hearers? But we need everybody to be talking about Christ,
   by lips and life, by the printed and the spoken word--telling about
   salvation by the precious blood for all who believe, forgiveness
   through the Grace of God for the guilty, renovation by the Holy Spirit
   for the depraved. Come, then, and give yourselves to the Lord, and then
   to His Church in order that you may spread the Gospel!

   Do this, again, to maintain the Church. Nothing in the world is dearer
   to God's heart than His Church. Therefore, being His, let us also
   belong to it that by our prayers, our gifts and our labors, we may
   support and strengthen it. If those who are Christ's refrained, even
   for a generation, from numbering themselves with His people, there
   would be no visible Church, no ordinances maintained and, I fear, very
   little preaching of the Gospel. Therefore follow the Macedonian example
   for the sake of the Church.

   And finally, do it that you may grow in love and continue to prove your
   love to your Lord and His Church. And also that you may continue to
   live unto the Lord and increase your life by mingling with others who
   are alive unto God. My dear friend, who is now lying so ill, of whom I
   have told you, does not regret that he joined the Church, for, being a
   commercial traveler, he had opportunities of preaching Christ in
   different places. And that he might render the best possible

   service to his Lord, he always lived wherever his pastor told him to
   live, seeing that his business interests did not tie him down to any
   particular place. If there was no Church in a town, he went and lived
   there till he had raised one! Then he moved off to another spot and
   founded another Church. And so he continued to spread the knowledge of
   his Lord and Master! He is now lying between life and death and if he
   is raised up, again, it will be a miracle--yet perhaps the Lord will do
   that work of healing if He has yet further service for our Brother on
   earth. [The Brother referred to has been raised up, as by a miracle.
   His recovery was a great encouragement to many as they prayed for their
   Pastor's restoration.] Though he is so ill, he does not regret anything
   that he has done, but only wishes that it had been in his power, as it
   was in his will, to do still more for his Master! Those who are about
   to be welcomed into the Church, as we gather around the Communion
   Table, may regret it if they are not good men and true, but if they
   have first given themselves to the Lord, they will never regret the
   step they are now taking in identifying themselves with His Church.

   The sum of all that I have said is this--let all who are not the Lord's
   come and, first of all, give themselves to Him and then give themselves
   to His people and to His service. And let those of us who are already
   Christ's, keep together and fulfill our vows more than ever we have
   done--and so prove continually that we have given ourselves to the Lord
   and to His people, according to His will. Thus shall God be magnified,
   Christ glorified, His Church increased and the world blessed. God grant
   it, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--2 Corinthians 8.

A Warrant for Your Apprehension

   (No. 2235)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 20, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   19, 1891.

   "The word of the Lord is against you." Zephaniah 2:5.

   The word of the Lord was against the land to which these words were
   spoken. The whole verse reads, "Woe unto the inhabitants of the
   seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the Lord is
   against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy
   you, that there shall be no inhabitant." This contest could have only
   one end, for behind "the word of the Lord" was the Lord Himself. "Woe
   unto him that strives with his Maker!" Who shall dare to oppose His
   sovereign will? All forces are at His command and they are foolish,
   indeed, who say to Him, "What are You doing?" I have not come here,
   however, to speak to you simply about the land of the Philistines and
   the sinners who dwelt there. The burden of my sermon is concerning men
   and women who are now living and to whom I may truthfully say, "The
   Word of the Lord is against you." May you wake up to see the truth of
   this terrible sentence and, by the power of the Holy Spirit, be at once
   moved to flee from the wrath to come!

   The Philistines were one of the Canaanite nations and they were so
   prominent that they gave their name to the whole country. Palestine was
   the land of the Philistines. These people had a fine physical
   development and among them were persons of unusual stature. There were
   giants in their cities--Goliath of Gath is the one most familiar to us
   because of his encounter with David--but there were many others. They
   were, moreover, a very warlike race. When God brought His people out of
   Egypt into the land of promise, the five lords of the Philistines were
   to be destroyed and their cities were to be taken by the Israelites.
   But they were not destroyed and neither were their cities captured, for
   the Israelites had not faith enough and the Philistines were men of
   courage and stubbornly defended their country. They even came to be the
   oppressors of Israel and, becoming a great and powerful nation, held
   the Hebrews in subjection for many a year. Even when Israel was strong
   and brought Philistia under tribute, the Philistines constantly
   revolted and harassed the Israelites. They were always against God and
   against God's people--and though Jehovah waited long and patiently,
   that they might have space for repentance, yet they repented not. When
   this prophecy was given, their cup was full. They had so sinned against
   God that, at last, the day of their doom came and the Prophet
   Zephaniah, in the name of God, said to them, "The word of the Lord is
   against you."

   I do not know that anybody else was against them. They were a people
   who feared nobody and, for many years, when they were attacked, first
   by one and then by another, they held their own. They had
   strongly-fenced cities, some of which stood, after the time of Christ,
   even in the age of the Crusaders, so that they had no reason to fear
   the other nations of the earth. They could maintain their rights
   against all comers and it seemed as if they would never be moved. But
   prosperity is often deceitful. Their fancied security was only like a
   thin crust over a lava bed--and the volcano lay beneath ready to burst
   forth at any moment.

   They had one overwhelming cause for dread, though they knew it not.
   They could conquer all nations, but a foe was marching upon them,
   against which they would fight in vain. When the Prophet delivered the
   message, "The word of the Lord is against you," he rang the knell of
   their doom. What an adversary is this, "The word of the Lord"! This
   enemy is more powerful than Egypt, or Assyria, or any of the tribes of
   men on the face of the earth. It is more terrible, too, than the voice
   of the storm. Many times the Lord had thus scattered those that opposed
   themselves against Him--"The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and
   the Highest gave His voice; hail stones and coals of fire. Yes, He sent
   out His arrows, and scattered them; and He shot out lightning and
   discomfited them." Those who have the Word of the Lord against

   them have an enemy to fear more dreadful than the most fearful
   convulsion of Nature, more terrible than the simoom of the desert, the
   sirocco of the plain, or the Euroclydon of the sea! The Prophet does
   not attempt to show the Philistines by what instrumentality God would
   break them in pieces, whether by plague, or famine, or pestilence, or
   war. He simply says, "The word of the Lord is against you." That is
   enough. He states the cause--the effects are sure to follow.

   Today, as the result of the warfare mentioned in my text, Philistia is
   swept away and its cities are destroyed. Gaza and Ekron, Ashdod and
   Askelon have perished by the judgment of God. I have not time to give
   you the evidence of travelers to prove that the prophecy against them
   has been kept to the very letter. Where it seemed as if it had failed,
   there has been only a more complete fulfillment of the sentence against
   the Lord's enemies.

   My main business at this time, is not, however, with the Philistines.
   God's Word is against a good many other people besides them and I am
   going to try to talk to some of them in words of solemn warning. My
   message to many must be, "The Word of the Lord is against you." Oh,
   that God may help me so to speak that your life may be changed and that
   the Word of God may be against you no longer! Hearken, then, to this
   word, you that are living in sin, you that are refusing the Savior, you
   that are delaying the time of repentance, you that have backslidden,
   you that are opposing the Gospel-- "The Word of the Lord is against
   you." I would like to get hold of some man who is in this terrible
   condition of rebellion against God and hold him by the hand while I
   speak to him, in a kind and friendly and fraternal way, this solemn
   word of warning--"The Word of the Lord is against you."

   First, I shall simply state the general fact, that it is so--the Word
   of the Lord is really against many men and women. Secondly, I shall
   endeavor to make it clear that if you are living with the Word of the
   Lord against you, it is a very terrible thing. And, thirdly, if you are
   awakened to see your danger, I shall try to set before you what can be
   done in the matter.

   I. First, concerning many people, my text is literally true, "the Word
   of the Lord is against you." It is so. Just as surely and as
   sorrowfully as we can say, today, that the law of England is against
   some of the people in England, we can affirm that the Word of the Lord
   is against many of the inhabitants of the earth. The Word of the Lord
   will not, cannot change--and there it stands, bearing testimony against
   many, who, in due time, unless they become partakers of the Grace of
   the Lord Jesus, shall be overwhelmed and destroyed without remedy!

   I am quite sure that "the Word of the Lord" is against some of you,
   because you are against the Word of the Lord. There is war between you
   and this wonderful Book. You do not enjoy the reading of it, no,
   perhaps, you have even come to hate it! You oppose it--possibly you
   even wish there were no Bible. Perhaps you have been drinking in
   theories of Inspiration that make it to be practically no
   Bible--deposing it from its rightful position as a full and
   authoritative guide in all matters of faith and practice. If you do not
   accept it as such, you are against it! If this is true of you, I fear
   that it is because you do not understand the Bible. God's Word carries
   within itself the evidence of its Truth. It teaches men who are not
   encased in prejudice. It enlightens those who will open their eyes to
   see. You cannot be against it unless you have a clear suspicion that it
   is against you! The fact is, the Bible does not please you--it does not
   let you sin with impunity--it presents to you a way of salvation that
   does not pander to your pride, or flatter your intellect. Therefore,
   you do not like the Book. "The Word of the Lord is against you." Now,
   be you sure of this, that if you are against the Word of the Lord, it
   is because the Word of the Lord is against you.

   Again, I am sure that the Bible is against you, for you do not care to
   read it. Your conscience will be with me when I urge this reason, for
   many of you know well that you have a strange distaste for the Bible.
   Can you tell me why, in some countries, Romanists are forbidden to read
   the Scriptures? Why do the priests or their emissaries take from the
   people the Bibles which the booksellers have scattered? The reason is
   to be sought for in the false teaching and superstitious observances of
   the Church of Rome! If you went into a shop to buy an article and the
   first thing that the man did was to turn down the gas or blow out the
   candle, you would say to yourself, "He is going to sell me bad wares
   and he does not want me to have too much light lest I should find him
   out."

   The reason why the priest of the Catholic church is against the Bible
   is because the Bible is against him. Now it is just so with you. You
   would read the Book willingly enough if you were agreed with it, but
   because it is too truthful, too faithful and exposes your faults too
   much, therefore you do not like it and you do not read it. How long is
   it since some of you have read even a chapter of Scripture? How long is
   it since you have thought over one gracious text? Oh, my dear Friends,
   if I probe you, if I press this matter upon some of you, it will be
   clear enough that the Word of God is against

   you, for you, yourself, know that it is and, therefore, do not read it.
   You do not want to be plagued by it. It condemns your sins. It disturbs
   your false security. It robs you of your sleep in evil. "The Word of
   the Lord is against you"--your neglect of the Word shows that this is
   true.

   And truly the Word of the Lord must be against you, for it must be
   against sin and you delight in sin. If you live in sin and love sin,
   should God send you a Book to pacify your conscience in such a state?
   If that which is unjust, intemperate and unholy, is hidden in your
   heart, and is practiced in your life, would you expect the Holy Spirit
   to write a Book to help you on in such a way as that? It is blasphemy
   to think that it could be so! All through the Book sin is uniformly and
   universally condemned, from the day when Adam was driven out of the
   Garden because of his transgression, until the flood came upon guilty
   man because "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
   evil continually." On Sinai the same Truth was thundered out. This was
   the burden of the Prophets' messages. The Word of God is always against
   sin and many times the warning is given, "The soul that sins, it shall
   die." If you are a sinner steeped in sin, depend upon it that this Book
   is against you and ought to be against you You could not wish it to be
   otherwise if you are a right-minded person. You will say, "Whatever I
   may be, I do not want the Bible tampered with, to make it suit my
   ungodly life, nor do I wish Holy Scripture to favor me in an evil
   pursuit."

   This Book must be against some of you because you have refused Christ.
   God has given His dear Son to die to save men. He has appointed the one
   way of salvation to be through faith in the precious blood of Christ.
   If you will not have the appointed way. If you refuse the ordained
   Savior, this Book may well quarrel with you, for you quarrel with God!
   What? The blood of His dear Son given to redeem and yet you reject it?
   Mercy dressed in crimson to save you and yet you fly from it? Love
   Incarnate in a bleeding Savior and yet you spurn it? Perhaps you
   imagine that you are good enough to be saved without Christ, but what
   infamous pride this is on the part of a poor sinful worm of the dust!
   Perhaps your whole confidence is in your own good works and you hope
   they will be found sufficient without the blood of Calvary-- that is
   presumptuous arrogance and vain conceit for a man who is born in sin
   and shaped in iniquity! Truly "the Word of the Lord" cannot side with
   you!

   If it is given to reveal Christ as the Savior of men, it cannot take
   the part of him who refuses that Savior, slights the blood of Christ
   and does despite to the Spirit of Grace. Oh, my dear Friend, when I
   used to read the Bible and had not yet looked to Christ, how sternly it
   used to speak to me! It had an angry look. It threatened me. It seemed
   to draw a sharp sword and thrust it into my heart! I bless the Bible
   for being severe with my unbelief! It was the wound of a friend which
   it gave me--when I was wounded, I fled to Christ for cure. If the Word
   of God were not against you in your rejection of Christ, it could not
   be the Word of God and, if you did not know it to be against you, it
   would be an unhappy thing for you to be rocked in the cradle of
   unbelief and allowed to remain far from God without a warning. Until
   you believe in Christ, be you sure of this--"the Word of the Lord is
   against you!"

   Even if you do not read God's Word and thus discover that it is against
   you, your conscience tells you that it ought to be. Many men and women
   who are sitting here, if they did but begin to think, would say, "I
   must be wrong. God's Book, which is Truth, itself, must be against me."
   Men will not allow conscience to speak, but if they do, it soon bears
   testimony in the same line as God's own Word, for you cannot very
   readily make your conscience a false witness. There are some who
   preach, today, that all men will be saved, whether they believe in
   Christ or not. I remember what a certain hearer said to a minister who
   preached that doctrine--"Sir, if what you have preached today is true,
   we do not need you. Indeed, we do not need any minister at all--we can
   get along all right without one. And if what you have preached is not
   true, we do not need you--so in either case we have no need of your
   ministrations." The hearer knew that what the minister had preached was
   not the Truth of God--conscience confirmed the declarations of the Word
   of God.

   The Word of God would be true, however, whether conscience confirmed it
   or not, but conscience does tell men that it cannot be the same with
   the wicked as with the righteous--it cannot be the same with those who
   reject the Savior as with those who accept Him. You cannot silence that
   voice within the heart! A Unitarian minister who preached that wild
   doctrine of universal salvation which is so popular just now, once met
   an old-fashioned Baptist preacher who was not a well-educated man, but
   who had a crowded congregation--while his learned friend had only a
   dozen or two to hear him eloquently discourse. The Unitarian said, "I
   cannot make out how it is that there is such a difference in our
   congrega-tions--you get so many to hear you, and I get so few. I preach
   a very pleasing doctrine. I tell the people that all will be

   right with them all at last. I do not worry them with any doctrines of
   repentance and faith and Atonement--and yet they will not come to hear
   me.

   "You preach a very dreary doctrine and you tell the people that unless
   they repent they shall perish and be cast into Hell, and yet they crowd
   your place to hear you. How is that?" "Well," said the old man, "I
   think it is, my Friend, because they have a shrewd suspicion that what
   I say is true, and that what you say is not true." There he hit the
   nail on the head! It is so. The conscience of men bids them distrust
   the word which tells them that there will be no difference between the
   righteous and the wicked! God has somehow written on the heart of man
   this judgement--"Sin must be punished. It cannot be the same with the
   godly and the ungodly at the last." Hear that voice of your conscience!
   Listen to it and it will tell you that "the Word of the Lord is against
   you."

   One thing more. You who live in sin and will not have a Savior may be
   sure that "the Word of the Lord is against you." Your efforts to harden
   your heart prove it. The struggle you have to make in order to keep all
   things quiet within your own bosom leaves no room for doubt that, "the
   Word of the Lord is against you." Sometimes, when you are being spoken
   to about your soul, you do not like it. You feel irritable. You make
   some jest, or you utter some blasphemy, or repeat some old worn-out
   slander to stiffen yourself to reject the Word of God. And when you get
   home it takes you all your time to press down the sparks which the
   Gospel has kindled in your heart! You are kept very busy trying to
   stamp them out, for you know that you have some inflammable stuff in
   your soul--and you are afraid that there will be a fire within. If you
   did not think the Word of God was against you, you would not have to
   make such a vigorous effort to prevent its having its due effect upon
   your mind! Oh, that you would yield, young man! Oh, that you would let
   God's Word do its will with you, young woman! Oh, all you of whom it is
   true--"The Word of the Lord is against you"--I pray that you would let
   it break you in pieces, wound you, kill you and then make you alive and
   heal you!

   II. In the second place, I want to say that if "the Word of the Lord is
   against you," IT IS A VERY TERRIBLE THING. When the word of Pharaoh was
   against the Israelites, they suffered cruel bondage, but the Word of
   the Lord was stronger than the word of the mighty despot--and when He
   spoke by Moses and Aaron, His people were brought out free. When the
   word of King Saul was against David, he was hunted like a partridge
   upon the mountains. But the Word of the Lord was confirmed to him and
   he was delivered from the hand of his enemy and, at last, seated on the
   throne. When the word of Nebuchadnezzar was against the three Hebrew
   youths, they were cast into the burning fiery furnace--but the Lord
   delivered them, as He also delivered Daniel when the word of Darius was
   against him. But when "the Word of the Lord is against you," its
   judgment is more to be dreaded than the bondage of Egypt, more to be
   feared than the fiery furnace or the den of lions, for there is none
   that can deliver you from the power of the Lord, whose Word has gone
   forth against you. If this is your case, you are truly in a terrible
   state!

   If "the Word of the Lord is against you," you have great cause for
   trembling, for it cannot be bribed. Many a wealthy man has escaped the
   punishment he deserved because he has used his silver and his gold
   judiciously. It cannot be so easily done, now, in this country, as it
   used to be, though there is still a gift that blinds the eyes and many
   a man of position has escaped his deserts because of his wealth. But
   you cannot bribe the Word of God, though there are some who seem to try
   to do it! They live a whole life regardless of God and His Word,
   amassing money by fair means or foul, and then, when they cannot use it
   further, they leave it for some religious purpose in the hope of thus
   meriting favor with God, taking care all the while, generally, to have
   their own name lastingly associated with the gift! But there is nothing
   which you can give that will be taken by the Word of the Lord as a
   payment for your wrong. It will speak and it will effect its purpose in
   spite of all your bribes!

   If "the Word of the Lord is against you," you may well be dismayed as
   you remember that it will never be changed. You cannot, by any
   possibility, so long as you are what you are, make it cease to be
   against you! If a man is against me, today, he may be my friend
   tomorrow. The wind does not always blow from the same quarter. Tides
   that flow will also ebb, but God's Word never changes. From everlasting
   to everlasting it never turns an inch aside from the straight path. If
   you remain the same and that Word is against you, it will be against
   you in life and against you in death--against you at the Day of
   Judgement--and against you through all eternity. Oh, my dear Hearer, it
   is a dreadful thing to have this immutable, unchanging Word of God
   against you!

   It is a terrible position, again, to have the Word of the Lord against
   you because it cannot be escaped. You may get away from the Queen's
   writ by flying to the Continent. You may escape a warrant of arrest by
   fleeing to certain coun-

   tries, though I scarcely know where you can now go--but how can you
   escape from the Word of God? That Word changed chaos into order! That
   Word came into the thick darkness and there was light! "He spoke, and
   it was done." The Word of the Lord can come into your bedchamber. If
   you journey to the ends of the earth, the Word of God can find you out,
   even though you never read it! It can reach you even if you should
   become a seven-fold infidel! You cannot change the threat by
   disbelieving it, nor escape the vengeance by professing that there is
   no such thing! The Psalmist's words about God's Omnipresence apply,
   also, to the Word of the Lord--"Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Or
   where shall I flee from Your Presence? If I ascend up into Heaven, You
   are there. If I make my bed in Hell, behold, You are there. If I take
   the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
   even there shall Your hands lead me, and Your right hand shall hold
   me." The Word of the Lord is everywhere--it cannot be escaped.

   Furthermore, it is a terrible thing to have the Word of the Lord
   against you, for it cannot be resisted. If a man is against you, you
   can fight it out with him. You may oppose force to force and cunning to
   cunning--but if the Word of the Lord is against you, what power have
   you? By His Word were the heavens made! By His Word the heavens and the
   earth shall pass away and be dissolved! How can you fight against the
   Word of God? As well might Pharaoh fight with the plagues that Jehovah
   sent upon him. God's Word is too strong for you. "Woe unto him that
   strives with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of
   the earth," but strive not you with Him who has all power and whose
   Word is "quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,
   piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the
   joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of
   the heart."

   And now let me speak to you very solemnly. If "the Word of the Lord is
   against you," what a state you must be in, for God is Love and He will
   not say a word against a man if He can help it. God is gracious,
   tender, loving--and when God Himself has to be against a man, the
   condition of that man's heart must be something very terrible--his
   state of life must be so depraved as to demand that Love should give
   place to Justice. Why, this Book of God was written for sinners,
   written to cheer penitent hearts, and if it is against you, what a
   state you must be in! Here is food prepared for an invalid--if you
   cannot eat it--if it turns your stomach, how diseased you must be! If
   the medicine becomes poison; if the sweet is sour; if the Light of God,
   itself, is darkness to you, O wretched madman, you have come into an
   evil plight, indeed! God have mercy upon you! If God's Word is against
   you, you are in an awful state, indeed!

   Not only is this true, but what a sad state you will soon be in!
   Whether you believe it or not, you will soon be dead and, dying, you
   will pass into another world. And, being there, you will come to the
   seat of judgment to be tried for the things done in the body. You will
   need witnesses in your favor and this Book will be called to give its
   testimony. What will it say about you? If the Book could speak, it
   would say, "Great God, he never read me! I bear witness to his neglect
   of You, for he never read me." And many a text of Scripture would rise
   up in that last day and say, "I was preached to him! His mother quoted
   me to him. His sister wrote this in a letter. A friend sent him this
   verse and pleaded with him to take it to heart, but he heeded none of
   them." If "the Word of the Lord is against you," the Law of God will
   say, "He knew me and he broke me!" The Gospel will say, "He knew me and
   he refused me!" The Bible, itself, will say, "He understood something
   of me, but he ridiculed me."

   It will go hard with a man who has such testimony against him at the
   bar of the Great Judge. Let me have the Bible on my side and I will
   fearlessly face the whole world. But if the Bible is against me, I must
   be conquered. If it is against me in the Last Day, I must be
   speechless. He whom the Word condemns has the foretaste of that final
   condemnation which shall be his in the next state unless, by Sovereign
   Grace, he shall be constrained to turn to God before it is too late! I
   cannot speak as I would on this awful theme, but I am trying to plead
   with you from my very soul. Oh, that God the Holy Spirit would send
   home the Word of God to many!

   Remember, my dear Hearers, there is not a wasted word in this Book.
   Whatever God says will happen to the ungodly, will happen to them.
   Judgment is God's strange work, but what He threatens, He will
   certainly perform. How terrible will it be when the threats of His Word
   come to pass! See, even in the verse from which our text is taken, a
   glimpse of what it may mean. First, there is woe. "Woe unto the
   inhabitants of the seacoast." Then there is destruction, "I will even
   destroy you." When the woe is past, there is utter destruction--"There
   shall be no inhabitant." Oh, the woe of having the Word of the Lord
   against you! Behold, again, how those cities which Christ would have
   blessed so highly were cursed when they rejected His message. "Woe unto
   you, Chorazin! Woe unto you, Bethsaida! Woe unto you, Caper-

   naum!" These repeated, "woes," sound like a funeral knell! Today those
   cities are wholly swept away because the Word of the Lord was against
   them.

   Learn, also, from the history of Jerusalem, how surely the Word of the
   Lord against a man or against a city is fulfilled. Christ was rejected
   by the people of Jerusalem, so that it is not surprising that, "when He
   was come near, He beheld the city and wept over it," for He knew what a
   terrible doom awaited the guilty capital. Well might that demented man,
   of whom Josephus tells us, go through the streets of the city, when it
   was being besieged by Titus, and call out in tones of horror, "Woe, woe
   to Jerusalem!" Rest assured that the Lord will "render to every man
   according to his deeds." Those who obey His Word shall be forever
   blessed. But those who have the Word of the Lord against them shall be
   punished with everlasting destruction from the Presence of the Lord and
   from the glory of His power.

   I have been accused, sometimes, of picturing the wrath to come in too
   horrible a way, but I have never described it more sternly than Christ,
   Himself. It was His gentle lips that declared, "These shall go away
   into everlasting punishment." It was He who spoke of a place "where
   their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched." It was He who
   uttered the most awful words about the wrath to come. I pray you, do
   not wish to know, in your own experience, all that "the wrath to come"
   may mean! Flee from it! Seek rather to know what salvation means--and
   God help you to obtain it even now! If I am addressing any person who
   feels that the Word of God is against him, I do beseech and conjure him
   not to rest any longer in that condition! If you have a quarrel with
   God's Word, you are wrong! God's Word cannot be in error. If the Word
   of God offends you, you must be offended, or, rather, you have offended
   against it. It will never beg your pardon--you must beg its pardon, or,
   rather, seek forgiveness from the Lord whose Word is against you, and
   who is, Himself, also against you! Said I not truly that when "the Word
   of the Lord is against you," it is a terrible thing? If that is your
   position, may it soon be changed!

   III. Now I come to my third and last point. If it is true that "the
   Word of the Lord is against you" and that it is a terrible thing to be
   in such a state, WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE MATTER? Is there any way of
   escape, any loophole through which deliverance may come? If the Word of
   God cannot be bribed, changed, escaped, or resisted, what are we to do,
   since we cannot sit calmly beneath the curse of God?

   I think that the first thing to be done, if you would escape out of
   this direful position, is to confess that you are wrong. There is a
   writ out against you. You have run away from it. Come home! Submit
   yourself to the court. Be willing to be put under arrest. There is no
   other right course. I knew one who, being charged with embezzlement,
   fled the country. He still has to stay away. If he had submitted
   himself to whatever punishment might have come upon him, he would have
   passed through it long ago. But now he still remains under the censure
   of the law and cannot return. Now, you runaway from God, come home at
   once! Sinner, against whom the Lord has issued His warrant, yield
   yourself to the officer of Divine Justice at this moment! You need not
   move from your present position--but just where you are--humbly whisper
   in your heart, "Lord, I am guilty. I submit to Your Word. Whatever Your
   Word says, is true, and I will no longer fight against it. But here,
   bowing my head, I confess that the wrong is with me, not with Your
   Word. I confess that." Have you made this confession? Then it is well,
   for if, "the Word of the Lord is against you," your only hope lies in
   taking the side of the Word of the Lord and against yourself!

   But when a man gives himself up to justice, he has next to stand his
   trial. If "the Word of the Lord is against you," it is against you in
   your present position, in your present character and you must change
   your position. Come, then, and escape the hostility of the Word of the
   Lord by altering your attitude towards it! If you have loved sin,
   repent and hate it. May God the Holy Spirit work in you a loathing of
   evil things which the Word condemns, for when you are no longer a
   sin-lover, but a sin-loather, the Word that was against you will be for
   you! God has no thunderbolts for those who hate their sins. If your
   soul and sin are divorced, your soul and mercy may be married, but not
   otherwise. When you give up your sin, God will give up His suit against
   you. If you turn not, He will whet His sword--but if you turn, He will
   sheathe that sword and speak comfortably to you.

   Another change must take place. You must no longer stand in yourself,
   but in Another. The Word of the Lord is against you, but what if you
   could change places with Another, on whose side the Word of the Lord
   is, and in whom you could lawfully and rightly stand? What if Christ
   stood in your place and you should stand in Christ's place? Then this
   Word would not condemn you, but it would acquit you! And more than
   that, it would defend you against all your adversaries. Behold a
   miracle of mercy! Christ Jesus, the innocent Son of God, dies for the
   guilty sons of men, that they may be

   covered with His righteousness and accepted in His name! This is the
   pith and marrow of the Gospel--"I stand in Christ's place because He
   stood in mine. The Law cannot be against Him, for He fulfilled it and
   made it honorable. The Word of the Lord cannot be against Him, since He
   hid it in His heart, that He might not sin against God. And if I come
   to be in Him, where the Word is hidden, it can no longer be against
   me."--

   "Confounded, Lord, I wrap my face,

   And hang my guilty head,

   Ashamed of all my wicked ways,

   The hateful life I've led.

   I yield--by mighty love subdued;

   Who can resist its charms?

   And throw myself, by wrath pursued,

   Into my Sa vior's arms."

   Let me say to you further, that if you have, up to now, had the Word of
   the Lord against you, be very careful to be right with the Word. In
   seeking to be saved, avoid, above everything, a sham salvation. When a
   man has a bad sore, it is a mischievous thing to let it heal with proud
   flesh in it. To cover over a wound may be to create seven dangers
   instead of one. Come to the Word of God and search yourself. Use the
   lances, take the probe, examine into the depth of your wound and sore.
   Let your prayer be, "O God, let me never be comforted apart from Your
   Word. Let me have no foundation apart from Christ to build upon! Let me
   never think that I am saved unless Christ is my Savior." My dear Hearer
   you would be better off hungry than to eat poisoned meat! And you would
   be better off in despair than get comfort that does not spring out of
   the Word of God! If you think that you are saved and yet find that "the
   Word of the Lord is against you," you may be sure that you are not
   saved and should hasten to cast away your false confidence as quickly
   as possible! You can never be saved unless you are right with the Word
   of God--

   "This is the judge that ends the strife,

   Where wit and reason fail

   My guide to everlasting life

   Through all this gloomy vale."

   One more thing and I have done. If to have the Word of God against you
   is an overwhelming calamity, how happy are they who have the Word of
   the Lord with them! I have heard of two Romanists, a man and his wife,
   who purchased their first copy of the Scriptures. The man began to read
   it and, one night, as he sat beside the fire with the open Book, he
   said, "Wife, if this Book is right, we are wrong." He continued reading
   and a few days afterwards he said, "Wife, if this Book is right, we are
   lost." More eager, now, than ever to see what the Word of the Lord was,
   he studied the Book until, one night, he joyfully exclaimed, "Wife, if
   this Book is true, we are saved." The same word that showed them that
   they were undone, revealed also the Gospel of salvation! This is the
   glory of the Word of God--it is against us until it leads us out of our
   sins and then we find that death becomes the gate of life to our
   souls--and the Word of God is on our side!

   The same Word that reveals the terrors of the Lord, also says, "He that
   believes on the Son has everlasting life." I believe on the Son of God
   as my Savior, therefore I have everlasting life! The Word of the Lord
   is now for me and assures my deliverance. It further says, "God sent
   not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world,
   through Him, might be saved." When I read this, my heart sings for joy,
   for the Word of God which was against me, now justifies me! Again it
   says, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." As I tremble
   because it is written, "He that believes not shall be damned," I
   rejoice because the same Word says, "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." I believe, and I have been baptized--therefore I am
   saved! If you have the Word of God for you, you need no other advocate.
   Even your own conscience may be lawfully overridden by the Word of the
   Lord. "If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows
   all things."

   This is the sum of the whole matter! Come just as you are and trust
   Christ as your Savior! Leave your sin and seek after holiness. Have
   done with your own willfulness and seek the meek and lowly mind that
   was in the Man of Sorrows. In a word, come and lie at Jesus' feet and
   lift your tearful eyes to His loving gaze, and say--

   "A guilty, weak, and helpless worm, On Your kind arms I fall. Be You my
   strength and righteousness, My Jesus, and my All."

   Trust Christ! Trust Him now! Trust Him only! Trust Him wholly! Trust
   Him forever and you shall be eternally saved! As surely as the Bible is
   true, you are safe for time and for eternity if you believe in Jesus!

   God bless this feeble word of mine! I have tried to preach the Word of
   God faithfully, that, at the day of account, I may be clear of the
   blood of all men. I shall not, then, be asked whether I spoke
   eloquently, or whether I had energy of mind or power of voice--but I
   shall be asked if I warned you to escape from sin and seek the Savior!
   And that, by the Grace of God, I have done to the utmost of my power. I
   wish that I knew how to persuade men to seek the Lord. Oh, that I could
   learn the art of reading the hearts of men! What do you want with fine
   speeches? Escape for your lives! What do you want with polished phrases
   and rounded periods? "Lay hold on eternal life." Repent! Believe the
   Gospel and be saved! O God, the Holy Spirit, lead men to this blessed
   decision at this very moment, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON--Jeremiah 26.
     __________________________________________________________________

Prodigal Love for the Prodigal Son

   (No. 2236)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 27, 1891,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   29, 1891.

   "And kissed him." Luke 15:20.

   IN the Revised Version, if you will kindly look at the margin, you will
   find that the text there reads, "and kissed him much." This is a very
   good translation of the Greek which might bear the meaning, "Kissed him
   earnestly," or, "Kissed him eagerly," or, "Kissed him often." I prefer
   to have it in very plain language and, therefore, adopt the marginal
   reading of the Revised Version, "Kissed him much," as the text of my
   sermon, the subject of which will be the overflowing love of God toward
   the returning sinner.

   The first word, "and," links us on to all that had gone before. The
   parable is a very familiar one, yet it is so full of sacred meaning
   that it always has some fresh lesson for us. Let us, then, consider the
   preliminaries to this kissing. On the son's side, there was something,
   and on the father's side, much more. Before the prodigal son received
   these kisses of love, he had said in the far country, "I will arise and
   go to my father." He had, however, done more than that, otherwise his
   father's kiss would never have been upon his cheek. The resolve had
   become a deed--"He arose, and came to his father." A bushel full of
   resolutions is of small value--a single grain of practice is worth the
   whole. The determination to return home is good, but it is when the
   wandering boy begins the business of really carrying out the good
   resolve that he draws near the blessing. If any of you here present
   have long been saying, "I will repent. I will turn to God," leave off
   resolving and come to practicing! And may God, in His mercy, lead you
   both to repent and to believe in Christ!

   Before the kisses of love were given, this young man was on his way to
   his father, but he would not have reached him unless his father had
   come the major part of the way. When you give God an inch, He will give
   you a mile. If you come a little way to Him, when you are "yet a great
   way off" He will run to meet you. I do not know that the prodigal saw
   his father, but his father saw him. The eyes of mercy are quicker than
   the eyes of repentance. Even the eyes of our faith are dim compared
   with the eyes of God's love. He sees a sinner long before a sinner sees
   Him!

   I do not suppose that the prodigal traveled very fast. I should imagine
   that he came very slowly--

   "With hea vy heart and downcast eye, With many a sob and many a sigh."
   He was resolved to come, yet he was half afraid. But we read that his
   father ran. Slow are the steps of repentance, but swift are the feet of
   forgiveness! God can run where we can scarcely limp and if we are
   limping towards Him, He will run towards us. These kisses were given in
   a hurry. The story is narrated in a way that almost makes us realize
   that such was the case--there is a sense of haste in the very wording
   of it. His father "ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him"-- kissed
   him eagerly! He did not delay a moment, for though he was out of
   breath, he was not out of love. "He fell on his neck, and kissed him
   much." There stood his son ready to confess his sin--therefore did his
   father kiss him all the more. The more willing you are to acknowledge
   your sin, the more willing is God to forgive you. When you make a clean
   breast of it, God will soon make a clear record of it. He will wipe out
   the sin that you willingly acknowledge and humbly confess before Him.
   He that was willing to use his lips for confession found that his
   father was willing to use his lips for kissing him!

   See the contrast. There is the son, scarcely daring to think of
   embracing his father, yet his father has scarcely seen him before he
   has fallen on his neck! The condescension of God towards penitent
   sinners is very great. He seems to stoop from His Throne of Glory to
   fall upon the neck of a repentant sinner. God on the neck of a sinner!
   What a wonderful pic-

   ture! Can you conceive it? I do not think you can, but if you cannot
   imagine it, I hope that you will realize it. When God's arm is about
   our neck, and His lips are on our cheek, kissing us much, then we
   understand more than preachers or books can ever tell us of His
   condescending love!

   The father "saw" his son. There is a great deal in that word, "saw." He
   saw who it was. He saw where he had come from. He saw the swineherd's
   dress. He saw the filth upon his hands and feet. He saw his rags, saw
   his penitent look, saw what he had been, saw what he was and saw what
   he would soon be. "His father saw him." God has a way of seeing men and
   women that you and I cannot understand. He sees right through us at a
   glance, as if we were made of glass. He sees all our past, present and
   future.

   "When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him." It was not with
   icy eyes that the father looked on his returning son. Love leaped into
   them and as he beheld him, he, "had compassion on him." That is, he
   felt for him. There was no anger in his heart towards his son. He had
   nothing but pity for his poor boy who had got into such a pitiable
   condition. It was true that it was all his own fault, but that did not
   come before his father's mind. It was the state that he was in-- his
   poverty, his degradation--that pale face of his so wan with hunger that
   touched his father to the quick. And God has compassion on the woes and
   miseries of men. They may have brought their troubles on themselves and
   they have, indeed, done so. But, nevertheless, God has compassion upon
   them. "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because
   His compassions fail not."

   We read that the father, "ran." The compassion of God is followed by
   swift movements. He is slow to anger, but He is quick to bless. He does
   not take any time to consider how He shall show His love to penitent
   prodigals--that was all done long ago in the Eternal Covenant. He has
   no need to prepare for their return to Him--that was all done on
   Calvary. God comes flying in the greatness of His compassion to help
   every poor penitent soul--

   "On cherub and on cherubim, Full royally He rode! And on the wings of
   mighty winds Came flying all abroad."

   And when He comes, He comes to kiss! Master Trapp says that if we had
   read that the father had kicked his prodigal son, we should not have
   been very much astonished. Well, I would have been very greatly
   astonished, seeing that the father in the parable was to represent God!
   But still, his son deserved all the rough treatment that some heartless
   men might have given and, had the story been only that of a selfish
   human father, it might have been written that, "as he was coming near,
   his father ran at him and kicked him." There are such fathers in the
   world, who seem as if they cannot forgive. If he had kicked him, it
   would have been no more than he had deserved. But no, what is written
   in the Bible stands true for all time and for every sinner--"He fell on
   his neck, and kissed him"--kissed him eagerly, kissed him much!

   What does this much kissing mean? It signifies that when sinners come
   to God, He gives them a loving reception and a hearty welcome. If any
   of you, while I am speaking, shall come to God, expecting mercy because
   of the great Sacrifice of Christ, this shall be true of you as it has
   been true of many of us--"He kissed him much."

   I. First, this much kissing means MUCH LOVE. It means much love truly
   felt, for God never gives an expression of love without feeling it in
   His infinite heart. God will never give a Judas kiss and betray those
   whom He embraces. There is no hypocrisy with God--He never kisses those
   for whom He has no love. Oh, how God loves sinners! You who repent and
   come to Him will discover how greatly He loves you! There is no
   measuring the love He bears towards you. He has loved you from before
   the foundation of the world and He will love you when time shall be no
   more! Oh, the immeasurable love of God to sinners who come and cast
   themselves upon His mercy!

   This much kissing also means much love manifested. God's people do not
   always know the greatness of His love to them. Sometimes, however, it
   is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.
   Some of us know, at times, what it is to be almost too happy to live!
   The love of God has been so overpoweringly experienced by us on some
   occasions that we have almost had to ask for a stay of the delight
   because we could not endure any more! If the Glory had not been veiled
   a little, we would have died of excess of rapture, or happiness!
   Beloved, God has wondrous ways of opening His people's hearts to the
   manifestation of His Grace. He can pour in, not now and then a drop of
   His love, but great and mighty streams! Madame Guyon used to speak of
   the torrents of love that come swooping through the spirit, bearing all
   before them. The poor prodigal in the parable had so much love
   manifested to him that he might have sung of the tor-

   rents of his father's affection. That is the way God receives those
   whom He saves, giving them not a meager measure of Grace, but
   manifesting an overflowing love!

   This much kissing means, further, much love perceived. When his father
   kissed him much, the poor prodigal knew, if never before, that his
   father loved him. He had no doubt about it. He had a clear perception
   of it. It is very frequently the case that the first moment a sinner
   believes in Jesus, he gets this "much" love. God reveals it to him and
   he perceives it and enjoys it at the very beginning. Think not that God
   always keeps the best wine for the last--He gives us some of the
   richest dainties of His table the first moment we sit there! I remember
   the joy that I had when first I believed in Jesus and, even now, in
   looking back upon it, the memory of it is as fresh as if it were but
   yesterday! Oh, I could not have believed that a mortal could be so
   happy after having been so long burdened and so terribly cast down! I
   did but look to Jesus on the Cross and the crushing load was
   immediately gone--and the heart which could only sigh and cry by reason
   of its burden, began to leap and dance and sing for joy! I had found in
   Christ all that I needed and I rested in the love of God at once. So
   may it be with you, also, if you will but return to God through Christ.
   It shall be said of you as of this prodigal, "The father saw him and
   ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him in much love."

   II. Secondly, this much kissing means MUCH FORGIVENESS. The prodigal
   had many sins to confess, but before he came to the details of them,
   his father had forgiven him. I love confession of sin after
   forgiveness. Some suppose that after we are forgiven we are never to
   confess, but, oh, Beloved, it is then that we confess most truly
   because we know the guilt of sin most really! Then do we plaintively
   sing--

   "My sins, my sins, my Savior,

   How sad on You they fall!

   Seen through Your gentle patience,

   I tenfold feel them all.

   I know they are forgiven,

   But still their pain to me

   Is all the grief and anguish

   They laid, my Lord, on Thee." To think that Christ should have washed
   me from my sins in His own blood makes me feel my sin the more keenly
   and confess it the more humbly before God. The picture of this prodigal
   is marvelously true to the experience of those who return to God. His
   father kissed him with the kiss of forgiveness and yet, after that, the
   young man went on to say, "Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and
   before you, and am no more worthy to be called your son." Do not
   hesitate, then, to acknowledge your sin to God, even though you know
   that in Christ it is all put away!

   From this point of view, those kisses meant, first, "Your sin is all
   gone and will never be mentioned any more. Come to My heart, My son!
   You have grieved Me sorely and angered Me, but, as a thick cloud, I
   have blotted out your transgressions and as a cloud, your sins."

   As the father looked upon him and kissed him much, there probably came
   another kiss which seemed to say, "There is no soreness left--I have
   not only forgiven, but I have forgotten, too. It is all gone, clean
   gone! I will never accuse you of it any more. I will never love you any
   the less. I will never treat you as though you were still an unworthy
   and untrustworthy person." Probably at that there came another kiss,
   for do not forgot that his father forgave him, "and kissed him much,"
   to show that the sin was all forgiven.

   There stood the prodigal, overwhelmed by his father's goodness, yet
   remembering his past life. As he looked on himself, and thought, "I
   still have these old rags on and I have just come from feeding the
   swine," I can imagine that his father would give him another kiss, as
   much as to say, "My boy, I do not remember the past. I am so glad to
   see you that I do not see any filth on you, or any rags on you, either.
   I am so delighted to have you with me once more that as I would pick up
   a diamond out of the mire and be glad to get the diamond, again, so do
   I pick you up, you are so precious to me." This is the gracious and
   glorious way in which God treats those who return to Him. As for their
   sin, He has put it away so that He will not remember it. He forgives
   like a God! Well may we adore and magnify His matchless mercy as we
   sing--

   "In wonder lost, with trembling joy We take the pardon of our God!
   Pardon for crimes of deepest dye,

   A pardon bought with Jesus' blood.

   Who is pardoning God like Thee?

   Or who has Grace so rich and free?" "Well," asks one, "can such a
   wonderful change ever take place with me?" By the Grace of God it may
   be experienced by every person who is willing to return to God! I pray
   God that it may happen now and that you may get such assurance of it
   from the Word of God, by the power of His Holy Spirit, and from a sight
   of the precious blood of Christ shed for your redemption, that you may
   be able to say, "I understand it now! I see how He kisses all my sins
   away and when it rises, He kisses it away again! And when I think of it
   with shame, He gives me another kiss. And when I blush all over at the
   remembrance of my evil deeds, He kisses me again and again, to assure
   me that I am fully and freely forgiven." Thus the many kisses from the
   prodigal's father combined to make his wayward son feel that his sin
   was, indeed, all gone. They revealed much love and much forgiveness.

   III. These repeated kisses meant, next, FULL RESTORATION. The prodigal
   was going to say to his father, "Make me as one of your hired
   servants." In the far country he had resolved to make that request, but
   his father, with a kiss, stopped him. By that kiss, his sonship was
   acknowledged. By it the father said to the wretched wanderer, "You are
   my son." He gave him such a kiss as he would only give to his own son.
   I wonder how many here have ever given such a kiss to anyone. There
   sits one who knows something of such kisses as the prodigal received.
   That father's girl went astray and, after years of sin, she came back
   worn out, to die at home. He received her, found her penitent and
   gladly welcomed her to his house. Ah, my dear Friend, you know
   something about such kisses as those!

   And you, good woman, whose boy ran away, you can understand something
   about these kisses, too. He left you and you did not hear from him for
   years. And he went on in a very vicious course of life. When you did
   hear from him, it well-near broke your heart. And when he came back,
   you hardly knew him. Do you recollect how you took him in? You felt
   that you wished that he was the little boy you used to press to your
   bosom, but now he was grown up to be a big man and a great sinner--yet
   you gave him such a kiss and repeated your welcome so often that he
   will never forget it, nor will you forget it either. You can understand
   that this overwhelming greeting was like the father saying, "My boy,
   you are my son. Despite all that you have done, you belong to me.
   However far you have gone in vice and folly, I love you. You are bone
   of my bone, and flesh of my flesh." In this parable Christ would have
   you know, poor Sinner, that God will acknowledge you if you come to Him
   confessing your sin through Jesus Christ. He will gladly receive you,
   for all things are ready against the day that you return--

   "Spread for you the festal board,

   See with richest dainties stored.

   To your Father's bosom pressed,

   Yet again a child confessed.

   Never from his house to roam,

   Come and welcome, sinner, come."

   The father received his son with many kisses and so proved that his
   prayer was answered. Indeed, his father heard his prayer before he
   offered it! He was going to say, "Father, I have sinned," and to ask
   for forgiveness, but he got the mercy, and a kiss to seal it, before
   the prayer was presented! This also shall be true of you, O Sinner, who
   are returning to your God through Jesus Christ! You shall be permitted
   to pray and God will answer you. Hear it, poor, despairing Sinner,
   whose prayer has seemed to be shut out from Heaven! Come to your
   Father's bosom, right now, and He will hear your prayers and, before
   many days are over, you shall have the clearest proofs that you are
   fully restored to the Divine favor by answers to your intercessions
   that shall make you marvel at the Lord's loving kindness to you!

   Further than this, you shall have all your privileges restored, even as
   this wandering young man was put among the children when he returned.
   As you see him now in the father's house, where he was received with
   the many kisses, he wears a son's robe, the family ring is on his
   finger and the shoes of the home are on his feet. He eats no longer
   swine's food, but children's bread! Even thus shall it be with you if
   you return to God! Though you look so foul and so vile-- and really are
   even more defiled than you look--and though you smell so strongly of
   the hogs among which you have been living that some people's nostrils
   would turn up at you, your Father will not notice these marks of your
   occupation in the far country with all its horrible defilement! See how
   this father treats his boy. He kisses him and, kisses him again,

   because he knows his own child and, recognizing him as his child, and
   feeling his fatherly heart yearning over him, he gives him kiss after
   kiss. He kisses him much to make him know that he has full restoration.

   In this repeated kissing we see, then, these three things--much love,
   much forgiveness and full restoration.

   IV. But these many kisses meant even more than this. They revealed his
   father's EXCEEDING JOY. The father's heart is overflowing with gladness
   and he cannot restrain his delight. I think he must have shown his joy
   by a repeated look. I will tell you the way I think the father behaved
   towards his son who had been dead, but was alive again, who had been
   lost, but was found. Let me try to describe the scene. The father has
   kissed his son and he bids him sit down. Then he comes in front of him
   and looks at him, and feels so happy that he says, "I must give you
   another kiss." Then he walks away a minute, but he is back again before
   long, saying to himself, "Oh, I must give him another kiss!" He gives
   him another, for he is so happy. His heart beats fast. He feels very
   joyful. The old man would like the music to strike up. He wants to be
   at the dancing, but meanwhile he satisfies himself by a repeated look
   at his long-lost child. Oh, I believe that God looks at the sinner and
   looks at him again, and keeps on looking at him, all the while
   delighting in the very sight of him, when he is truly repentant, and
   comes back to his Father's house!

   The repeated kiss meant, also, a repeated blessing, for every time he
   put his arms round him, and kissed him, he kept saying, "Bless you, oh,
   bless you, my boy!" He felt that his son had brought a blessing to him
   by coming back and he invoked fresh blessings upon his head. Oh,
   Sinner, if you did but know how God would welcome you and how He would
   look at you, and how He would bless you, surely you would at once
   repent and come to His arms and heart--and find yourself happy in His
   love!

   The many kisses meant, also, repeated delight. It is a very wonderful
   thing that it should be in the power of a sinner to make God glad. He
   is the happy God, the Source and Spring of all happiness--what can we
   add to His blessedness? And yet, speaking after the manner of men,
   God's highest joy lies in clasping His willful Ephraims to His breast,
   when He has heard them bemoaning themselves, and has seen them arising
   and returning to their home! God grant that He may see that sight, even
   now, and have delight because of sinners returning to Himself! Yes, we
   believe it shall be so because of His Presence with us and because of
   the gracious working of the Holy Spirit! Surely that is the teaching of
   the Prophet's words--"The Lord your God in the midst of you is mighty;
   He will save, He will rejoice over you with joy; He will rest in His
   love, He will joy over you with singing." Think of the eternal God
   singing and remember that it is because a wandering sinner has returned
   to Him that He sings! He joys in the return of the prodigal and all
   Heaven shares in His joy!

   V. I have not got through my subject yet. As we take a fifth look, we
   find that these many kisses mean OVERFLOWING COMFORT. This poor young
   man, in his hungry, faint and wretched state, having come a very long
   way, had not much heart in him. His hunger had taken all energy out of
   him and he was so conscious of his guilt that he had hardly the courage
   to face his father. So his father gives him a kiss, as much as to say,
   "Come, boy, do not be cast down; I love you."

   "Oh, the past, the past, my Father!" he might moan, as he thought of
   his wasted years. But he had no sooner said that than he received
   another kiss, as if his father said, "Never mind the past. I have
   forgotten all about that." This is the Lord's way with His saved ones.
   Their past lies hidden under the blood of Atonement. The Lord says by
   His servant, Jeremiah, "The iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and
   there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be
   found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve."

   But then, perhaps, the young man looked down on his foul garments and
   said, the present, my Father, the present, what a dreadful state I am
   in!" And with another kiss would come the answer, "Never mind the
   present, my Boy. I am content to have you as you are. I love you."
   This, too, is God's word to those who are "accepted in the Beloved." In
   spite of all their vileness, they are pure and spotless in Christ, and
   God says of each one of them, "Since you were precious in My sight, you
   have been honorable, and I have loved you. Therefore, though in
   yourself you are unworthy, through My dear Son you are welcome to My
   home."

   "Oh, but," the boy might have said, "the future, my Father, the future!
   What would you think if I should go astray again?" Then would come
   another holy kiss and his father would say, "I will see to the future,
   my Boy. I will make home so bright for you that you will never want to
   go away again." But God does more than that for us when we return to
   Him. He not only surrounds us with tokens of His love, but He says,
   concerning us, "They shall be My people, and I will be their God: and I
   will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear Me forever,
   for the good of them, and of their children after them: and I will make
   an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them,
   to do

   them good; but I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not
   depart from Me." Furthermore, He says to each returning one, "a new
   heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and
   I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
   an heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you
   to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments, and do them."

   Whatever there was to trouble the son, the father gave him a kiss to
   set it all right and, in like manner, our God has a love token for
   every time of doubt and dismay which may come to His reconciled sons.
   Perhaps one whom I am addressing says, "Even though I confess my sin
   and seek God's mercy, I shall still be in sore trouble, for through my
   sin I have brought myself down to poverty." "There is a kiss for you,"
   says the Lord--"Your bread shall be given you, and your water shall be
   sure." "But I have even brought disease upon myself by sin," says
   another. "There is a kiss for you, for I am Jehovah-Rophi, the Lord
   that heals you, who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your
   diseases." "But I am dreadfully down at the heel," says another. The
   Lord gives you, also, a kiss, and says, "I will lift you up and provide
   for all your needs. No good thing will I withhold from them that walk
   uprightly." All the promises in this Book belong to every repentant
   sinner who returns to God believing in Jesus Christ, His Son!

   The father of the prodigal kissed his son much and thus made him feel
   happy then and there. Poor souls, when they come to Christ, are in a
   dreadful plight, and some of them hardly know where they are. I have
   known them talk a lot of nonsense in their despair and say hard and
   wicked things of God in their dreadful doubt. The Lord gives no answer
   to all that except a kiss, and then another kiss! Nothing puts the
   penitent so much at rest as the Lord's repeated assurance of His
   unchanging love. Such a one the Lord has often received, "and kissed
   him much," that He might fetch him up, even, from the horrible pit and
   set his feet upon a rock and establish his goings. The Lord grant that
   many whom I am addressing may understand what I am talking about!

   VI. And now for our sixth head, though you will think I am getting to
   be like the old Puritans with these many heads. But I cannot help it,
   for these many kisses had many meanings--love, forgiveness,
   restoration, joy, comfort-- were in them and, also, STRONG ASSURANCE.

   The father kissed his son much to make him quite certain that it was
   all real. The prodigal, in receiving those many kisses, might say to
   himself, "All this love must be true, for a little while ago I heard
   the hogs grunt and now I hear nothing but the kisses from my dear
   father's lips." So his father gave him another kiss, for there was no
   way of convincing him that the first was real like repeating it--and if
   there lingered any doubt about the second, the father gave him yet a
   third. If, when the dream of old was doubled, the interpretation was
   sure--these repeated kisses left no room for doubt! The father renewed
   the tokens of his love that his son might be fully assured of its
   reality.

   He did it that in the future it might never be questioned. Some of us
   were brought so low before we were converted that God gave us an excess
   of joy when He saved us, that we might never forget it. Sometimes the
   devil says to me, "You are no child of God." I have long ago given up
   answering him, for I find that it is a waste of time to argue with such
   a crafty old liar as he is--he knows too much for me. But if I must
   answer him, I say, "Why, I remember when I was saved by the Lord! I can
   never forget even the very spot of ground where first I saw my
   Savior--then and there my joy rolled in like some great Atlantic billow
   and burst in mighty foam of bliss, covering all things. I cannot forget
   it." That is an argument which even the devil cannot answer, for he
   cannot make me believe that such a thing never happened. The Father
   kissed me much and I remember it full well. The Lord gives to some of
   us such a clear deliverance, such a bright, sunshiny day at our
   conversion, that, from that day, forward, we cannot question our state
   before Him but must believe that we are eternally saved!

   The father put the assurance of this poor returning prodigal beyond all
   doubt. If the first kisses were given privately, when only the father
   and son were present, it is quite certain that, afterwards, he kissed
   him before men, where others could see him. He kissed him much in the
   presence of the household, that they, also, might not be calling in
   question that he was his father's child. It was a pity that the elder
   brother was not also there. You see he was away in the fields. He was
   more interested in the crops than in the reception of his brother. I
   have known such a one in modern days. He was a man who did not come out
   to weekly evening services. He was such a man of business that he did
   not come out on a Thursday night and the prodigal came home at such a
   time--and so the elder brother did not see the father receive him. If
   he lived now, he would probably not come to the Church Meetings--he
   would be too busy. So he would not get to know about the reception of
   penitent sinners. But the father, when he received that son of his,
   intended all to know, once and for all,

   that he was, indeed, his child! Oh, that you might get those many
   kisses even now! If they are given to you, you will have, for the rest
   of your life, strong assurance derived from the happiness of your first
   days.

   VII. I have done when I have said that I think that here we have a
   specimen of the INTIMATE COMMUNION which the Lord often gives to
   sinners when they first come to Him. "His father saw him, and had
   compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him much."

   You see, this was before the family fellowship. Before the servants had
   prepared the meal, before there had been any music or dancing in the
   family, his father kissed him. He would have cared little for all their
   songs and have valued but slightly his reception by the servants, if,
   first of all, he had not been welcomed to his father's heart. So is it
   with us--we need first, to have fellowship with God before we think
   much of union with His people. Before I go to join a Church, I want my
   Father's kiss! Before the pastor gives me the right hand of fellowship,
   I want my heavenly Father's right hand to welcome me! Before I become
   recognized by God's people here below, I want a private recognition
   from the great Father above--and that He gives to all who come to Him
   as the prodigal came to his father. May he give it to some of you now!

   This kissing, also, was before the table communion. You know that the
   prodigal was afterwards to sit at his father's table and to eat of the
   fatted calf. But before that, his father kissed him. He would scarcely
   have been able to sit easily at the feast without the previous kisses
   of love. The Communion Table to which we are invited is very sweet. To
   eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ, in symbol, in the
   ordinance of the Lord's Supper, is, indeed, a blessed thing. But I want
   to have communion with God by the way of the kiss of love before I come
   there. "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth." This is
   something private, ravishing and sweet. God give it to many of you! May
   you get the many kisses of your Father's mouth before you come into the
   Church, or to the Communion Table!

   These many kisses, likewise, came before the public rejoicing. The
   friends and neighbors were invited to share in the feast. But think how
   shamefaced the son would have been in their presence, if, first of all,
   he had not found a place in his father's love, or had not been quite
   sure of it. He would almost have been inclined to run away again! But
   the father had kissed him much and so he could meet the curious gaze of
   old friends with a smiling face until any unkind remarks they might
   have thought of making died away, killed by his evident joy in his
   father! It is a hard thing for a man to confess Christ if he has not
   had an overwhelming sense of communion with Him. But when we are lifted
   to the skies in the rapture God gives us, it becomes easy, not only to
   face the world, but to win the sympathy of even those who might have
   opposed. This is why young converts are frequently used to lead others
   into the Light of God--the Lord's many kisses of forgiveness have so
   recently been given to them that their words catch the fragrance of
   Divine Love as they pass the lips just touched by the Lord. Alas, that
   any should ever lose their first love and forget the many kisses they
   have received from their heavenly Father!

   Lastly, all this was given before the meeting with the elder brother.
   If the prodigal son had known what the elder brother thought and said,
   I would not have wondered at all if he had run off and never come back!
   He might have come near home, and then, hearing what his brother said,
   have stolen away again. Yes, but before that could happen, his father
   had given him the many kisses! Poor Sinner, you have come in here and,
   perhaps, you have found the Savior. It may be that you will go and
   speak to some Christian man and he will be afraid to say much to you. I
   do not wonder that he should doubt you, for you are not, in yourself,
   as yet a particularly nice sort of person to talk to. But, if you get
   your Father's many kisses, you will not mind your elder brother being a
   little hard on you!

   Occasionally I hear of one who wished to join the Church, saying, "I
   came to see the Elders and one of them was rather rough with me. I
   shall never come again." What a stupid man you must be! Is it not their
   duty to be a little rough with some of you, lest you should deceive
   yourselves and be mistaken about your true state? We desire lovingly to
   bring you to Christ and if we are afraid that you really have not yet
   come back to God, with penitence and faith, should we not tell you so,
   like honest men? But suppose that you have really come and your brother
   is mistaken--go and get a kiss from your Father and never mind your
   brother! He may remind you how you have squandered your living,
   painting the picture even blacker than it ought to be--but your
   Father's kisses will make you forget your brother's frowns!

   If you think that in the household of faith you will find everybody
   amiable, and everyone willing to help you, you will be greatly
   mistaken. Young Christians are often frightened when they come across
   some who, from frequent disappointment of their hopes, or from a
   natural spirit of caution, or perhaps from a lack of spiritual life,
   receive but coldly those upon whom the Father has lavished much love.
   If that is your case, never mind these cross-grained elder brothers

   and sisters--get another kiss from your Father! Perhaps the reason it
   is written, "He kissed him much," was because the elder brother, when
   he came near him, would treat him so coldly and so angrily refuse to
   join in the feast.

   Lord, give to many poor trembling souls the will to come to You! Bring
   many sinners to Your blessed feet and while they are yet a great way
   off, run and meet them! Fall on their neck, give them many kisses of
   love and fill them to the full with heavenly delight, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

Gratitude for Deliverance from the Grave

   (No. 2237)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 3, 1892,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON,

   "I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord. The Lord
   has chastened me sorely: but He has not given me over unto death."
   Psalm 118:17,18.

   In connection with the dedication of the Jubilee House, which
   commemorated the fifth year of a life often threatened by grievous
   sickness.

   "This sermon begins a new volume--in fact, it commences Volume 38 of
   The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit. I have, myself, selected it and
   prepared it for the press because it is most suitable as my own
   personal testimony at the present moment. The subject is even more my
   own, this day, than it was seven and a half years ago, for I have been
   in deeper waters and nearer to the mouth of the grave. With my whole
   soul I praise delivering Grace. To the Lord God, the God of Israel, I
   consecrate myself anew! For the Covenant of Grace, for the revelation
   of the Infallible Truth in the Bible, for the Atonement by blood and
   the immutable love of the ever blessed Three-in-One, I am a witness and
   more and more would I abide faithful to the Gospel of the Grace of God!
   I see, each day, more reasons for faith and fewer excuses for doubt.
   Those who will, may ship their anchors and be drifted about the current
   of the age, but I will sing, 'My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is
   fixed: I will sing and give praise!"'

   "The whole passage, Psalm 118:13-18, is inscribed upon a marble slab on
   the Jubilee House at the back of the Tabernacle and I am told that many
   went to read it while I lay in the greatest peril through sore
   sickness--and were comforted thereby. When the Lord permits me to
   return, I must raise yet another memorial to His praise." [This quote
   is at the end of the sermon with this request from Brother Spurgeon, on
   page one--"Will the reader kindly note the remarks at the end of this
   sermon, before he reads the discourse."--EOD]

   HOW very differently we view things at different times and in differing
   states of mind! Faith takes a bright and cheerful view of matters and
   speaks very confidently, "I shall not die, but live." When we are slack
   as to our trust in God and give way to misgivings and doubts and fears,
   we sing in the minor key and say, "I shall die. I shall never live
   through this trouble. I shall one day fall by the hand of the enemy;
   and that day is hastening on. Hope is failing me. Bad times are at the
   door. I shall not live through this crisis." Thus our tongues show the
   condition of our inner man. We talk according to our frames and
   feelings and would make others think that things are as we see them
   with our jaundiced eyes!

   Is it not a pity that we give a tongue to our unbelief? Would it not be
   better to be dumb when we are doubtful? Muzzle that dog of unbelief!
   Dog, did I call him? He is a wolf--or should I call him a hound of
   Hell? His voice is that of Apollyon--it is full of blasphemy against
   God! Unbelieving utterances will do no good to yourself and will do
   harm to those who listen to your babblings. It would be wise to say,
   "If I should speak thus, I should offend against the generation of your
   children. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me." Let
   us be dumb with silence when we cannot speak to the Glory of God!

   But, oh, it is a blessed thing, when faith is reigning and powerful in
   our spirit, to let it have ample opportunity to proclaim the honors of
   His name! To give his heart a tongue is wise in man when his heart,
   itself, is wise. The more talk we get from the mouth of faith, the
   better--her lips drop sweet-smelling myrrh! A silent faith, if there is
   such a thing, robs others of benedictions and, at the same time, it
   does worse, for it robs God of His Glory. When we have a joyous

   faith in full operation, let us be communicative and let us openly and
   boldly say, "I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the
   Lord." I would follow my own advice and crave a patient hearing from
   you.

   You know, perhaps, that this text was inscribed by Martin Luther upon
   his study wall, where he could always see it when at home. Many
   Reformers had been done to death--Huss, and others who preceded him,
   had been burnt at the stake. Luther was cheered by the firm conviction
   that he was perfectly safe until his work was done. In this full
   assurance he went bravely to meet his enemies at the Diet of Worms and,
   indeed, went courageously whenever duty called him. He felt that God
   had raised him up to declare the glorious doctrine of Justification by
   Faith and all the other Truths of God he believed to be the Gospel of
   God and, therefore, no wood could burn him and no sword could kill him
   till that work was done. Thus he bravely wrote out his belief and set
   it where many eyes would see it, "I shall not die, but live, and
   declare the works of the Lord."

   It was no idle boast, but a calm and true conclusion from his faith in
   God and fellowship with Him. May you and I, when we are tried, be able,
   through faith in God, to meet trouble with the same brave thoughts and
   speeches! We cannot show our courage unless we have difficulties and
   troubles. A man cannot become a veteran soldier if he never goes to
   battle. No man can get his sea legs if he lives always on land.
   Rejoice, therefore, in your tribulations, because they give you
   opportunities of exhibiting a believing confidence and, thereby,
   glorifying the name of the Most High. But take heed that you have
   faith, true faith in God--do not become a puppet of impressions--much
   less a slave of the judgments of others. To have David's faith, you
   must be as David. No man may take up a confidence of his own making--it
   must be a real work of the Spirit and growth of Grace within--grasping
   with living tendrils the promise of the living God.

   I will read the passage from the Psalms over, again, and we will
   consider it, with God's help. "I shall not die, but live, and declare
   the works of the Lord. The Lord has chastened me sorely: but He has not
   given me over to death."

   First, here is the Believer's view of his afflictions. "The Lord has
   chastened me sorely." Secondly, here is the Believer's comfort under
   those afflictions. "He has given me over to death. I shall not die, but
   live." And, thirdly, here is the Believer's conduct after his
   afflictions and after his deliverance from them--"I shall not die, but
   live, and declare the works of the Lord."

   I. At the outset, here is THE BELIEVER'S VIEW OF HIS AFFLICTIONS. "The
   Lord has chastened me sorely." On the surface of the words we see the
   good man's clear observation that his afflictions come from God. It is
   true he perceived the secondary hand, for he says, "You have thrust
   sorely at me that I might fall." There was one at work who aimed to
   make him fall. His afflictions were the work of a cruel enemy. Yes, but
   that enemy's assaults were being overruled by the Lord and were made to
   work for his good, so David, in the present verse, corrects himself by
   saying, "The Lord has chastened me sorely. My enemy struck at me and he
   might make me fall, but, in very truth, my gracious God was using him
   to chasten me that I might not fall. The enemy was moved by malice, but
   God was working by him in love to my soul. The second agent sought my
   ruin, but the Great First Cause worked my education and establishment."

   It is well to have Grace enough to see that tribulation comes from
   God--He fills the bitter cup as well as the sweet goblet! Troubles do
   not spring out of the dust, neither does affliction grow up from the
   ground like hemlock from the furrows of the field, but the Lord,
   Himself, kindles the fiery furnace and sits as a Refiner at the door.
   Let us not dwell too much upon the part played by the devil, as though
   he were a coordinate power with God. He is a fallen creature and his
   very existence depends upon the will and permission of the Most High!
   His power is borrowed and can only be used as the Infinite Omnipotence
   of God permits. His wickedness is his own, but his existence is not
   self-derived. Blame the devil and blame all of his servants as much as
   you will, but still believe in the mysterious and consoling Truth of
   God that, in the truest sense, the Lord sends trials upon His saints.

   "Explain this statement," you say. Oh, no--I am not called upon to
   explain it, but to believe it! A great many things, when they are said
   to be explained by modern thinkers, are merely explained away--and I
   have not yet begun to learn that wretched art. Remember how Peter told
   the Jews that He whom God, by His determinate counsel and foreknowledge
   decreed to die, even His Son, Jesus Christ, was, nevertheless, taken by
   them with wicked hands when they had crucified and slain Him? The death
   of Christ was predetermined in the counsel of God and yet it was,
   nonetheless, an atrocious crime on the part of ungodly men! The
   Omnipotence and Providence of God are to be believed, but man's
   responsibility is not, therefore, to be questioned. Our afflictions may
   come distinctly from man, as the result of persecution

   or malice, and yet they may come with even greater certainty from the
   Lord and may be the necessary outcome of His special love to us.

   For this reason we may wisely moderate our anger against second causes.
   If you strike a dog with a stick, he will bite the stick. If he were
   more intelligent, he would snap at the person using the stick and, if
   that intelligence were governed by the spirit of obedience, he would
   yield to the blow and learn a lesson from it. Thus, when Shimei reviled
   David and Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said unto the king, "Why should
   this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray you, and
   take off his head," David meekly replied, "So let him curse, because
   the Lord has said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why have
   you done so?" A sight of God's hand in a trial is the end of rebellion
   against it in the case of every good man! He says, "It is the Lord: let
   Him do what seems good to Him."

   We may lie at His feet and cry, "Show me why You contend with me," but,
   if the reason does not appear, we must bow in reverent submission and
   say with one of old, "I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because You
   did it." Job saw the Lord in his many tribulations and, therefore,
   praised Him, saying, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away;
   blessed be the name of the Lord." Surely there is nothing better for a
   man of God than to perceive that his smarts and sorrows come from his
   Father's hand, for then he will say, "The will of the Lord be done."
   This is the great point in the Believer's view of his afflictions--"He
   makes sore and binds up: He wounds and His hands make whole."

   Next, the Believer perceives that his trials come on as a chastening.
   "The Lord has chastened me sorely." When a child is chastised, two
   things are clear--first, that there is something wrong in him, or that
   there is something deficient in him so that he needs to be corrected or
   instructed. And, secondly, it shows that his father has a tender care
   for his benefit and acts in loving wisdom towards him. This is
   certainly true if the father is an eminently kind and yet prudent
   parent. Children do not think that there can be any need for chastening
   them, but when years have matured their judgment, they will know
   better. "No chastening for the present seems to be joyous"--if it did
   seem joyous, it would not be chastening! The "need be" is not only that
   we have manifold trials, but that we are in heaviness through them. In
   the smart of the sorrow lies the blessing of the chastisement! God
   chastens us in the purest love because He sees that there is an
   absolute necessity for it--"for He does not afflict willingly nor
   grieve the children of men." Our fathers, according to the flesh, too
   often corrected us according to their own pleasure--and yet we gave
   them reverence. But the Father of our spirits corrects us only of
   necessity--a necessity to which He is too wise to close His eyes. Shall
   we not, therefore, pay greater reverence to Him and bow before Him and
   live? When Hezekiah was recovered of his sickness, he wrote, "O Lord,
   by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my
   spirit." I find not that men live by carnal pleasure, nor that the life
   of the spirit is ever found in the wine vat or in the oil press. But I
   do find that life and health often come to saints through briny tears,
   through the bruising of the flesh and the oppression of the spirit. So
   have I found it and I bear my willing witness that sickness has brought
   me health, loss has conferred gain--and I doubt not that one day death
   will bring me fuller life!

   Be wise then, dear child of God, and look upon your present affliction
   as a chastening. "What son is he whom the father chastens not?" "As
   many as I love, I rebuke and chasten." There is not a more profitable
   instrument in all God's house than the rod! No honey was sweeter than
   that which dropped from the end of Jonathan's rod, but that is nothing
   compared to the sweetness of the consolation which comes through
   Jehovah's rod! Our brightest joys are the birth of our bitterest
   griefs. When the woman has her travail pangs, joy comes to the house
   because a child is born--and sorrow is to us, also, full often, the
   moment of the birth of our Graces. A chastened spirit is a gracious
   spirit--and how shall we obtain it unless we are chastened? Like our
   Lord Jesus, we learn obedience by the things which we suffer! God had
   one Son without sin, but He never had a son without sorrow--and He
   never will while the world stands! Let us, therefore, bless God for all
   His dealings and, in a filial spirit, confess, "You, Lord, have
   chastened me."

   Consider the Psalmist's view of his affliction a little more carefully.
   He noted that his trials were sore--he says, "The Lord has chastened me
   sorely." Perhaps we are willing to admit in general that our trouble is
   of the Lord, but there is a soreness in it which we do not ascribe to
   Him, but to the malice of the enemy, or some other second cause. The
   false tongue is so ingenious in slander that it has touched the most
   tender part of our character and has cut us to the quick. Are we to
   believe that this is also, in some sense, of the Lord? Assuredly we
   are! If it is not of the Lord, then it is a matter for despair. If this
   evil comes apart from Divine permission, where are we? How can a trial
   be met which is independent of Divine rule and outside of the sacred
   zone of Providential government? It is hopeful when we find that all
   our ills lie

   within the fence of Omnipotent overruling! It is a comfort that we see
   a wall of fire round us--a circle so complete that even the devil,
   malicious as he is, cannot break through it to do more than the Lord
   allows!

   The camels are gone, the sheep, the oxen, the servants--all are
   destroyed--all this is most trying, but it is still true--"The Lord
   gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."
   But, look, another messenger comes and cries, "There came a great wind
   from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it
   fell upon the young men, and they are dead." Might not Job, then, have
   said, "This is a blow which I cannot bear; for it is evidently from the
   Prince of the power of the air"? No, but even after that, he said,
   "Blessed be the name of the Lord." When his wife said, "Curse God, and
   die," he still blessed God and held his integrity. He told her that she
   spoke as one of the foolish speaks and then he wisely added, "Shall we
   receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" "In
   all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly." May we stand fast
   in patience as Job did, even when our troubles overflow!

   It is folly to imagine, as we have sometimes done, the we could bear
   anything except that which we are called upon to endure. We are like
   the young man who says he needs a job. What can you do? He can do
   anything! That man you never hire because you know that he can do
   nothing. So it is with us. If we say, "I could bear anything but this,"
   we prove our universal impatience! If we had the choice of our crosses,
   the one we would choose would turn out to be more inconvenient than
   that which God appoints for us, but we will have it that our present
   cross is unsuitable and specially galling. I would say to any who are
   of that mind, "If your burden does not fit your shoulder, bear it till
   it does." Time will reconcile you to the yoke if Grace abides with you.
   It is not for us to choose our affliction--that remains with Him who
   chooses our inheritance for us! Read well this Word of God, "The Lord
   has hastened me sorely" and see the Lord's hand in the soreness of your
   trial! Even while the wound is raw and the smart is fresh--be conscious
   that the Lord is near!

   Yet there is in the verse a, "but," for the Psalmist perceives that his
   trial is limited--"but He has not given me over to death." Certain of
   the buts in Scripture are among the choicest jewels we have! Before us
   is a, "but," which shows that, however deep affliction may be, there is
   a bottom to the abyss. By God's Grace there is a limit to the force,
   the sharpness, the duration and the number of our trials--

   "If God appoints the number ten, They never can be eleven."

   Whenever the Lord mixes a potion for His people, He weighs each
   ingredient, measures the bitters, grain by grain, and allows not even a
   particle in excess to mingle in the draft! Like a careful dispenser, He
   will not pour out a drop too little or too much--

   "To His Church, His joy and treasure, Every trial works for good-- They
   are dealt in weight and measure, Yet how little understood-- Not in
   anger,

   But from His dear Covenant love." Our Father's anger with our sin will
   never blaze into wrath against us, though in mercy He will smite our
   sins. Remember, then, this gracious boundary. "The Lord has chastened
   me sorely: but He has not given me over unto death." We have never yet
   experienced a trouble which might not have been worse. One affliction
   kills another--the wind never blows east and west at the same time.
   When the Lord smites you with His left hand, He sustains you with His
   right hand. As tribulations abound, so do consolations abound through
   Christ Jesus. The whole band of troubles never comes forth at once.
   Everything painful is graded and proportioned to the man and his
   strength--and the objective for which it is sent. With the trial, the
   Lord makes the way of escape that we may be able to bear it. Faith can
   see an end and limit where Nature's dim eyes see endless confusion.
   Where the carnal sense--

   "Sees every day new straits attend,

   And wonders where the scene will end," Faith looks over the intervening
   space and comforts herself with that which is yet to come. Faith sings
   pleasant songs when she foots it over weary roads--

   "The road may be rough, but it cannot be long,

   So let's smooth it with hope and cheer it with song."

   The Lord keep your faith alive, my Brothers and Sisters, and then
   whatever trials surge around you, you will sit on the Rock of Ages,
   above the waves, and joyfully sing praises unto your Divine Deliverer!
   Oh, how sweet to say, as I do now, "The Lord has chastened me sorely:
   but He has not given me over unto death!"

   II. This brings me, secondly, to consider THE BELIEVER'S COMFORT UNDER
   HIS AFFLICTIONS. The Believer's comfort under his afflictions is
   this--"I shall not die, but live."

   Occasionally this comes in the form of a presentiment. I do not think
   that I am superstitious. I fancy that I am pretty clear of that vice,
   yet I have had presentiments concerning things to come or not to come.
   And, moreover, I have met with so many Christians who, in the time of
   trouble, have received amazing warnings, or sweet assurances of coming
   deliverance, that I am bound to believe that the Lord does, sometimes,
   whisper to the heart of His children and assure them in trial that they
   shall not be crushed--and in sickness that they shall not die.

   How do you understand the story of John Wycliffe, at Lutterworth, in
   any other way than this? He had been speaking against the monks and
   various abuses of the church. He was the first man known to history
   that preached the Gospel in England during the Popish ages--we know him
   as the Morning Star of the Reformation! He was a man so great that, if
   he had possessed a printing press, we might never have needed a
   Luther--for he had an even clearer light than that great Reformer! He
   lacked the means of spreading his doctrine which the art of printing
   supplied. He did much--he prepared everything for Luther's hands--and
   Luther was but the proclaimer of Wycliffe's doctrine! Wycliffe was
   ill--very ill--and the friars came round him like crows round a dying
   sheep. They professed to be full of tender pity, but they were right
   glad that their enemy was going to die! So they said to him, "Will you
   not repent? Before we can give you viati-cum--the last oiling before
   you die--would it not be well to retract the hard things which you have
   said against the zealous friars and His Holiness of Rome? We are eager
   to forget the past and give you the last sacrament in peace."

   Wycliffe begged an attendant to help him sit up and then he cried with
   all his strength, "I shall not die, but live, to declare the works of
   the Lord and to expose the wickedness of the friars." He did not die,
   either--Death, himself, could not have killed him, then, for he had
   work to do and the Lord made him immortal until it was done! How could
   Wycliffe know that he spoke truly? Certainly he was free from all
   foolhardy bragging, but there was upon his mind a foreshadowing of
   future work that he had to do--and he felt that he could not die until
   it was accomplished!

   Now, do not be making up presentiments about all sorts of things
   because I have said that sometimes the Lord grants them to His saints.
   This would be a mischievous piece of absurdity! I remember a young
   woman who lived not far from here, who had a presentiment that she
   would die. I do not think that there was really much the matter with
   her, but she refused to eat and was likely to be starved. I went to see
   her and she told me that she had a presentiment that she would die and,
   therefore, she would not waste food by eating it. She spoke to me very
   solemnly about this presentiment and I replied, "I believe there may be
   such things." Yes--she was sure I was on her side! Then I went on to
   say, "I once had a presentiment that I was a donkey and it turned out
   true in my case. And now I have much the same presentiment about you!"

   This surprised her and I asked her friends to bring her food. She said
   she would not eat it and then I told her that if she was resolved on
   suicide, I would mention it at Church Meeting that evening and put her
   out of the Church, since we could not have suicides in our membership.
   She could not bear to be put out of the Church and began to eat--and it
   turned out that my presentiment about her was correct--she had been
   foolish and she had the good sense to see that it was so. I felt bound
   to tell you this story, lest you should fancy that I would support you
   in sentimental nonsense. While there are so many stupid people in the
   world, we have no need to give cautions where the wise do not need
   them! Forecasts of good from the Lord may come to those who are sorely
   sick--and when they do, they help them to recover. We are of good
   courage when an inward confidence enables us to say, "I shall not die,
   but live, and declare the works of the

   Lord."

   This, however, I only mention by the way. When a Believer is in
   trouble, he derives great comfort from his reliance upon the compassion
   of God. The Lord scourges His children, but He does not slay them. The
   Believer says, "My Father may make me smart with the blow of a cruel
   one, but He will do me no real harm, nor allow anyone else to injure
   me. He will not lay upon me more than is right, nor above what I am
   able to bear. He will stay His hand when He sees that I have no
   strength left. Moreover, I know that even when He brings me very low,
   still underneath me are the everlasting arms. If the Lord kills, it is
   only to make alive--if He wounds, it is that He may heal. I am sure of
   that."

   O Believer, never let anything drive you away from this confidence, for
   it has sure truth for its foundation! The Lord is good and His mercy
   endures forever. It is not killing, but curing, that God means when He
   takes the sharp lancet in His hands. The nauseous medicine which makes
   the heart sick, works for the cure of a worse sickness. "His
   compassions fail not." He may often put His hand into the bitter box,
   but He has sweet cordials ready to take the taste away. For a small
   moment has He forsaken us, but with great mercies will He return to us.
   You have an effectual comfort if your faith can keep its hold upon the
   blessed fact of the Lord's fatherly compassion.

   Next, faith comforts the tried child of God by assuring him of the
   forgiveness of his sin and his security from punishment. Please notice
   the very distant difference between chastisement and punishment. I do
   not say between the meaning of the words, but between the two things
   which I just now would indicate by those terms. Here is a boy who has
   committed a theft. He is brought before the magistrate that he may be
   punished. Punitive justice will be executed upon him by imprisonment or
   by a birch rod. Another boy has also stolen--stolen from his
   father--and he is brought before his father--not to be punished as a
   law-breaker, but to be chastised. There is a great difference between
   the punishment awarded by justice and the chastisement appointed by
   love! They may be alike in painfulness, but how different in meaning!

   The father does not give his child what he would deserve if it were a
   punishment according to the law, but what he thinks will cure him of
   the wrong-doing by making him feel that his sin brings sorrow. The
   magistrate, although he desires the good of the offender, has mainly to
   consider the law in its bearings upon the whole mass of the population
   and, therefore, he punishes, as a matter of justice, that which wrongs
   the commonwealth. But the parent acts on other principles. "The Lord
   has chastened me sorely" and, in that He has added a fatherly part,
   "but He has not given me over unto death," which would have been my lot
   if He had dealt with me as a judge! My heart trembles at His sword and
   cries, "Enter not into judgment with Your servant, O Lord: for in Your
   sight shall no man living be justified."

   The sentence of Justice has been fulfilled upon our Lord and our
   comfort is that now there is nothing punitive in all our troubles. "He
   has not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities"--nor will He do so, for He has already laid our sins upon
   Christ--and Christ has vindicated the Law by bearing its penalty so
   that nothing more in the way of penalty is demanded by the moral
   government of God. That which we receive from the rod of the Lord bears
   the blessed aspect of chastening from a father's hand--and this is a
   gladsome fact which makes even the sharpest smart to be profitable.
   "Surely the bitterness of death is past" when, in the case of the
   Believer, even death has ceased to be the penalty of sin and is changed
   into a sweet falling asleep upon the bosom of the Well-Beloved and to
   wake up in His likeness! Every other affliction is changed in the same
   fashion. Our wasps have become bees--their sting is not the prominent
   thought, but the honey which they lay up in store. "All things work
   together for good to them that love God," and chastisement is chief
   among those, "all things." What a well of comforting thought is here!

   Furthermore, it is a great blessing to a child of God to feel a full
   assurance that he has eternal life in Christ Jesus. "The Lord has
   chastened me sorely: but He has not given me over unto death." Notice
   the words, "Given me over." It is the most awful thing out of Hell to
   be given over by God! I fear that there are some such persons. Does not
   the Psalmist refer to such when he says, "They are not in trouble as
   other men; neither are they plagued like other men. Their eyes stand
   out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish"? While God's
   own people are chastened every morning and plagued all day long, the
   ungodly prosper in the world and increase in riches! Of His chosen, the
   Lord says, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
   therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."

   But those who are not the Lord's are left unchastened because the Lord
   has said of them, "Let them alone, they are given unto idols." They are
   allowed their transient mirth--let them make the most they can of it,
   for their end will be desolation. Unbroken prosperity and undisturbed
   health may be signs of being "given over unto death"--and they are in
   such cases where sin is committed without pangs of conscience, or
   apprehensions of judgment. Such freedom from fear may be maintained
   even in death--"There are no bands in their death: but their strength
   is firm." All goes quietly with them--"Like sheep they are laid in the
   grave." But, "in Hell they lift up their eyes, being in torments." To
   be given over unto death is often followed by callousness, presumption
   and bravado--but it is a dreadful doom--the direst sentence from the
   Throne of Judgment as to this life! But you, dear child of God, have
   this comfort, He has not given you over-- He is thinking about

   you! Men do not prune the vine they mean to uproot, nor thresh out the
   weeds which they mean to burn! He who is chastened is not given over to
   destruction.

   Years ago, I was taken very ill, in Marseilles, while attempting to
   come home to England. As I lay in bed, it seemed as if the cruel
   mistral wind was driving through my bones and breaking them with agony.
   I ordered a fire to be kindled, but when I saw the man begin to light
   it with a bundle of little branches, I cried out to him, "Pray let me
   look at that." I found that he was using the dry pruning of the vine
   and my tears were in my eyes as I remembered the words--"Men gather
   them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned." Comfort
   followed, for I thought, "I am not feeling, like those dried-up shoots,
   but I am the bleeding vine which is sharply cut with the pruning knife.
   I feel the keen blade in every part of me." Then I could say, "The Lord
   has chastened me sorely: but He has not given me over." What joy lies
   in this, "He has not given me over!" As long as the father chastens his
   boy, he has hope for him. If he ceased to do so altogether, we might
   fear that he thought him too bad to be reclaimed. Be glad, then, dear
   child of God, that since the Lord chastens you sorely, He has not
   erased your name from His heart or His hands, nor yielded you up to
   your enemy's power!

   Another meaning may be found in this text, "I shall not die, but live,
   and declare the works of the Lord. The Lord has chastened me sorely:
   but He has not given me over unto death." We are comforted by reliance
   upon God's power for success in our lifework. The critics said--and I
   must quote this because this sermon is very much a personal one--the
   critics said, when the lad commenced his preaching, that it was a nine
   days' wonder and would soon come to an end. When the people joined the
   Church in great numbers, they were "a parcel of boys and girls." Many
   of those "boys and girls" are here, tonight, faithful to God unto this
   hour! Then there came upon me a heavy, heavy stroke--a sore chastening,
   which those of us who were present would never forget if we live for a
   century! And we seemed to be made the reproach of all men, through an
   accident which we could not have foreseen or prevented.

   But still, the testimony for God in this place, by the same voice, has
   not ceased, nor lost its power. Still the people throng to hear the
   Gospel after these 30 years and more! And still the Doctrines of Grace
   are to the front, notwithstanding the opposition! In the darkest hour
   of my ministry I might have declared, "I shall not die, but live, and
   declare the works of the Lord." If you have been set on fire by a
   Divine Truth of God, the world cannot put an extinguisher upon you.
   That candle which God has lighted, the devils of Hell cannot blow out!
   If you are commissioned of God to do a good work, give your whole heart
   to it--trust in the Lord and you will not fail! I bear my joyful
   witness to the power of God to work mightily by the most insignificant
   of instruments--

   "The feeblest saint shall win the day Though death and Hell obstruct
   the way."

   Once more, though we may die, we are sustained by the expectation of
   immortality. When we gather up our feet in the last bed, we may utter
   this text in a full and sweet sense, "I shall not die, but live." When
   Wycliffe died as to his body, the real Wycliffe did not die. Some of
   his books were carried to Bohemia--and John Huss learned the Gospel
   from them and began to preach. They burned John Huss and Jerome of
   Prague, but Huss foretold, as he died, that another would arise after
   him whom they should not be able to put down! And in due time he more
   than lived, again, in Luther! Is Luther dead? Is Calvin dead today?
   That last man the moderns have tried to bury in a dunghill of
   misrepresentation, but he lives--and will live--and the Truths of God
   that he taught will survive all the calumniators that have sought to
   poison

   it!

   Die? Often the death of a man is a kind of new birth to him--when he,
   himself, is gone physically--he spiritually survives and from the grave
   there shoots up a tree of life whose leaves heal nations! O worker for
   God, death cannot touch your sacred mission! Be content to die if the
   Truth shall live better because you die! Be content to die because
   death may be to you, enlargement of your influence! Good men die as
   dies seed corn which thereby abides not alone. When saints are
   apparently laid in the earth, they quit the earth and rise and mount to
   Heaven's gate and enter into immortality! No, when the sepulcher
   receives this mortal frame, we shall not die, but live! Then shall we
   come to our true stature and beauty, put on our royal robes, our
   glorious Sabbath dress!

   III. So I finish with just two or three words on THE BELIEVER'S CONDUCT
   AFTER TROUBLE AND DELIVERANCE. "I shall not die, but live, and declare
   the works of the Lord."

   Here is declaration. If we had no troubles, we would all have less to
   declare. A person who has no experience of tribulation, what great
   deliverance has he to speak of? Such persons despise the afflicted and
   suspect the character of the choicest of men for lack of power to
   understand them. What does the man know about the sea who has only
   walked on the beach? Get with an old sailor who has been, a dozen
   times, around the world, and often wrecked, and he will interest you.
   So the much-tried Christian has great wonders to declare--and these are
   chiefly the works of the Lord for, "they that go down to the sea in
   ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the
   Lord, and His wonders in the deep." Tried Christians see how God
   sustains in trouble and how He delivers out of it--and they declare His
   works openly--they cannot help doing so. They are so interested in what
   God has done that they grow enthusiastic about it-- and if they held
   their peace, the stones would cry out!

   If you read the chapter further down, you will find that they not only
   give forth a declaration, but they offer adoration. They are so charmed
   with what God has done for them that they laud and magnify the name of
   the Lord, saying, "I will praise You: for You have heard me, and have
   become my salvation." The saints of God, when they are rescued from
   their sorrows, are sure to sing, "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my
   spirit has rejoiced in God, my Savior."

   This done, they make a further dedication of themselves to their
   delivering God. As the Psalm puts it, "God is the Lord, which has
   showed us light." It was very dark! It was very, very dark! We could
   not see our hand, much less the hand of God! We were frozen with fear.
   We thought we were, as dead men, laid out for burial, when suddenly the
   Lord's face shown in upon us and all darkness was gone! And we leaped
   into joyful security, crying, "God is the Lord, which has showed us
   light." We were convinced that it was none other than the true God who
   had removed the midnight gloom. Doubts, infidelities,
   agnosticisms--they were impossible! We said, "God is the Lord, which
   has showed us light." In the fourth watch of the night, in the prison
   where the cold stone shut us in, where the darkness had never known a
   candle, there a light shone round about us and an angel smote us on the
   side and bade us put on our sandals, and gird ourselves, and follow
   him. We obeyed the word, and our chains fell off; and when we came to
   the iron gate which had always been our horror, it opened of its own
   accord, and we went out into the streets of the city, and we scarcely
   felt that it could be true, but thought we saw a vision. But when we
   had considered the thing, and found it was even ourselves, and
   ourselves set in a large place at perfect liberty, then we said, "Bind
   the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar."

   God has showed us light and we will live to Him forever and forever.
   Oh, you tried Believers, who have, nevertheless, not been given over
   unto death, who can say, tonight, "I shall not die, but live," present
   yourselves anew unto your delivering Lord as living sacrifices through
   Jesus Christ your Lord! Amen.
