THE APOSTLES' CREED [1]

   The first to place the three creeds, the Apostolic, the
   Nicene-Constantinopolitan, and the Athanasian, side by side, as a full
   expression of the ecumenical confessions in the Church (with the
   addition of the Te Deum Laudamus) was probably Luther. Certain it is
   that it was only after his time, that is, after the second half of the
   sixteenth century, that Protestants first spoke definitely of the three
   ancient symbols. Yet it is also certain on the other hand that in the
   West these very three symbols had been in use in the churches, and had
   enjoyed great consideration, at least as much as five centuries
   earlier. [2] In the strict sense of the word, however, the predicate
   "ecumenical" applies only to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, for
   in the Eastern Church neither the Apostolic nor the Athanasian
   confession of faith has at any time received official recognition. [3]
   Indeed, the Eastern Church has at no time traced any creed to an
   Apostolic origin, or designated any as Apostolic in the strict sense of
   the word. [4] In the West, on the other hand, the three symbols form
   part of the confessional writings of the main Church, and the shortest
   of them (Symbolum minus) bears the very name "Apostolicum." But we also
   find the name "Apostolic" here and there established and in use in the
   West as a designation of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed; [5] nor
   is this only among Greeks who had become latinised. The three chief
   churches of the West possess the Symbolum Apostolicum in a form which
   agrees in all essential points ("Textus Receptus"). We shall therefore
   have to begin by treating of the origin of the creed in this form.

   [1] Notwithstanding the earlier labours of Laurentius Valla and
   Erasmus, the writer who may be described as the pioneer in the branch
   of investigation which deals with the origin of the creeds in the
   ancient Church is Usher, De Romanae ecclesiae symbolo apostolico vetere
   aliisque fidei formulis tum ab occidentalibus tum ab orientalibus in
   prima catechesei et baptismo proponi solitis Diatriba, 1647. Next come
   the names of Vossius, Pearson, Witsius, King, and Bingham. Walch
   collected the "Rules of Faith and the Symbols" in his Biblioth. Symbol.
   vetus, in 1770. His work was superseded in 1842 by Hahn' s Bibliothek.
   During the last forty-three years a fresh interest has been given to
   this field of labour by Heurtley' s Harmonia Symbolica (1858). More
   particularly since the year 1866, Caspari, a second Usher, has, by his
   various works, enormously increased the material for a study of this
   subject, and he has also sifted the material with the most critical
   care, Ungedruckte, unbeachtete und wenig beachtete Quellen zur
   Geschichte des Taufsymbols and der Glaubensregeln, 3 Bde., 1866-69-75;
   Alte und neue Quellen zur Geschichte des Taufsymbols and der
   Glaubensregeln, 1879. His labours enabled Hahn' s son to make a new
   work of his father' s Bibliothek in 1877. Among German scholars, von
   Zerschwitz, System der Katechetik, 2 Bde., 2te Auf. 1872, the present
   writer in the second edition of the Realencyclopädie and in the first
   volume of his Dogmengeschichte, Zahn, Das apostolische Symbolum, and
   above all, Kattenbusch, have taken a share in these investigations. In
   1894 the last-named writer issued the first volume of a great monograph
   upon the Creed, which justifies the eagerness with which its
   continuation is awaited. Among English scholars may be mentioned
   Harvey, The History and Theology of the Three Creeds, 1854; Foulke, The
   Athanasian Creed . . . with other Inquiries on Creeds in General, 1872;
   Lumby, The History of the Creed, 1873; Hort, Two Dissertations, 1876;
   and, above all, Swainson, The Nicene and Apostles' Creed, London, 1875.
   The relation of the old Roman symbol to the Formulas of Faith in the
   pre-Catholic period has been treated by the present writer in his Patr.
   App. Opp. ii. edit. 1, 2, 1878 (cf. A. Harnack, Das apostol.
   Glaubensbekenntniss, 26te Auf. 1893). Reference should also be made to
   the text-books on the History of Dogma. In the controversies
   periodically occurring over the Apostles' Creed a great number of
   brochures regularly appear which need not be enumerated here.

I

   The "Textus Receptus" can, with a satisfactory degree of certainty, be
   traced back, except in certain minute details, to the beginning of the
   sixth, or to the end of the fifth century. But there is a strong
   probability that this form of the symbol was not previously in official
   use in any church, whether as a part of the Interrogationes de fide or
   the Traditio and Redditio Symboli; nay, there is no discoverable sign
   of the existence of this particular form before the middle of the fifth
   century. [6] As it did not, at all events, come to the West from the
   Eastern Church, and symbols can be shown to have been in use in various
   provincial churches in the West during the fourth and fifth centuries
   which materially differ from the "textus receptus" of the Apostolicum,
   we may infer that it scarcely existed in its received form earlier than
   the middle of the fifth century, and probably did not assume its
   present shape, complete in every detail, before about the year 500. In
   that shape it appears for the first time in a sermon of Caesarius of
   Arles. [7] The immediate predecessor of Caesarius' symbol, or, as the
   case may be, of the Apostolicum as we have it, is very probably that of
   Faustus of Rietz, about 460, but it does not admit of being
   satisfactorily reconstructed. [8] On the other hand the stage
   succeeding that of the old Roman symbol in the direction of our
   Apostles' Creed is represented by the highly interesting symbol
   discovered by Bratke in the Berne Codex, [9] which I regard with him as
   a Gallican, or, as the case may be, a Gallico-British symbol, and
   assign to the fourth century. It differs from the old Roman symbol only
   by the additions of "passus," "descendit ad inferos," "catholicam," and
   "vitam aeternam." These four additions all lie in the direction of our
   Apostles' Creed and at the same time prove that they are the four
   oldest additions, whilst "conceptus, etc." and "communionem sanctorum"
   are later. "Creatorem coeli et terrae" and "mortuus" are also earlier.
   [10]

   Against the Roman origin of the Apostles' Creed, called by modern
   writers the later and longer Roman symbol, inasmuch as it was
   undoubtedly through the influence of Rome that it in later times
   attained universal authority in the West, we may oppose the fact (1)
   that it was not found in Rome until the Middle Ages, that is to say,
   many centuries after its existence had been attested by Caesarius of
   Arles, and (2) that from the end of the fifth, or the beginning of the
   sixth century, until the tenth, the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed in
   Greek, and the Apostles' Creed, were used in Rome in the traditio
   symboli, [11] and that, so far as the use of a shorter symbol side by
   side with. the Constantinopolitan was known in Rome during the
   Byzantine period (the sixth to the eighth century), it was not
   identical with the Apostles' Creed. Our Apostles' Creed points very
   plainly to Southern Gaul, and to a period about the year 500. But the
   spread of the "textus receptus" of the Symbolum Apostolicum throughout
   Western Europe in the sixth century was soon accompanied by the legend
   of its wonderful origin. [12] That a symbol of such recent origin
   should from the beginning bear the name "Apostolic" suggests the
   conjecture that it has a history earlier than the fifth century, and
   that another form must have preceded the "textus receptus," the
   attributes of which were then transferred to the new text supplanting
   it. The contention that this later creed or symbol traced its origin to
   a sumbole or "collatio" involves a confusion between sumbole, which
   also bears the meaning of "summa" or "brevis complexio," and sumbolon,
   that is, "signum," "indicium," in the sense not only of a distinction
   between Christians and non-Christians, or between Christians and
   heretics, but also in the sense of "tessera militum," a token or deed
   of agreement. [13] The name "Symbolum" is first found in the West in
   Cyprian; [14] in the East, not until after the beginning of the sixth
   century. [15] The legend [16] that each of the twelve Apostles, in a
   general session before their separation, contributed a phrase to the
   creed, was exploded even as early as Laurentius Valla and Erasmus, [17]
   but seems to point to a confirmation of the conjecture above hazarded
   as to the earlier form. This conjecture, which is also suggested by a
   glance at the very simple contents of the creed and its clear and
   compact form, is strikingly confirmed by history.

II

   The fact that the Roman Church in the period between 250 and 460 A.D.,
   and partly also later, [18] used a symbol in its religious services
   which was held in very great honour and to which no additions were
   permitted, has been well known ever since Usher' s investigations, [19]
   but was more particularly proved by Caspari' s researches. At Rome this
   symbol was believed to have been obtained from the Apostles in the form
   in which it was used, and this led to the supposition that Peter
   brought it to Rome. The idea of its Apostolic origin did not arise
   later than the fourth century. We find this symbol, the older, shorter
   Roman creed, existing complete in a number of texts, [20] quite
   independently of the sources from which it could be at least partially
   reconstructed.

   The Greek text must be regarded as the original, for at Rome the symbol
   was for a long time used only in Greek. [21] It was not until long
   after the Greek text was in use that the Latin text was adopted as a
   parallel form. What happened here, then, is just the opposite of what
   happened in the case of the longer symbol. [22] The following is the
   text of the shorter or Greek form: Pisteuo eis theon patera
   pantokratora kai eis Christon Iesoun (ton) huion autou ton monogene,
   ton kurion hemon, ton gennethenta ek pneumatos hagiou kai Marias tes
   parthenou, ton epi Pontion Pilatou staurothenta kai taphenta, te trite
   hemera; anastanta ek (ton) nekron, anabanta eis tous ouranous,
   kathemenon en dexia tou patros hothen erchetai krinai zontas kai
   nekrous, kai eis pneuma hagion, hagian ekklesian, aphesin hamartion,
   sarkos anastasin.

   The legend of the symbol having been composed by the Apostles appears
   as early as the above-mentioned Explanatio Symboli of Ambrose. The fact
   that the writer was aware of its being divided into twelve articles
   perhaps indicates that the legend of each Apostle having contributed
   one of them was already known. The twelve articles were arranged in
   three groups of four, or three tetrads. The division into tetrads,
   however, appears nowhere else. It arose, in my opinion, from the third
   article and the second half of the second appearing as though composed
   of four members each. Kattenbusch in his Programme thinks otherwise,
   but in his chief work [23] his statements on the point are modified. I
   cannot, however, convince myself that twelve divisions were originally
   intended. [24] No one who wanted to construct a creed with twelve
   articles in three main divisions would have been so clumsy as to divide
   it into 1 + 7 + 4, or, rather, 2 + 6 + 4. At all events the legend did
   not originate in connexion with the later and Ionger Roman creed, that
   is, the South Gallican or our present Apostles' Creed, for it already
   appears in the manuscript of the shorter symbol which Swainson first
   published, and is also proved elsewhere to apply to this creed.
   Rufinus, however, who wrote later, knows nothing about it; [25] all
   that he knows is the common composition of the Roman symbol by the
   Apostles soon after Pentecost and before. the separation. But he refers
   this legend to a traditio maiorum. It was doubtless, therefore, in
   existence from the beginning of the fourth century. Both Ambrose and
   Rufinus testify, moreover, that the Roman Church preserved the exact
   words of the Apostles' Creed with the most scrupulous fidelity. [26]
   The Apostolic origin of this symbol is independently asserted by
   Jerome, [27] by the Roman bishops Celestin I. (422-431), Sixtus III.
   (431-440), Leo I. (440-461), by Vigilius of Thapsus, and in the
   Sacramentarium Gelasianum. [28] The belief in the Apostolic origin of
   the creed must therefore be regarded as originating in the Roman
   Church. Finally, it may be added that Augustine must also be claimed as
   a witness for this shorter Roman symbol. Although he was first a
   presbyter and then a bishop in a provincial church, in which the
   recognised and official symbol was one which varied considerably from
   the Roman, yet as a pupil of Ambrose, and as one who was baptized in
   the church at Milan, he held to the Roman symbol, with which, according
   to the Explanatio Symboli, the Milanese symbol was identical. In the
   eight expositions of the creed which we have from him [29] he follows
   the Milanese form almost exclusively, and he follows it in all
   essential points. In view of these facts there can be no doubt that in
   the fourth and the first half of the fifth century the Roman Church
   made extensive use in the Redditio of a symbol, and a symbol, too,
   identical with the one mentioned above, and allowed of absolutely no
   additions to it. Ambrose was certainly not the only one [30] who
   expressly protested against any anti-heretical additions. He regarded
   it as an attack upon the Saints to take account of contemporary
   difficulties in the creed, however pressing these might be. "He
   attributed to the creed the very highest authority, higher even than
   that of Apostolic writings composed by individual Apostles." The
   epistle of Marcellus to Julius shows us that between the years 330-340
   A.D., this symbol was the official one in use in Rome; but other
   testimonies, which still require to be criticised and sifted, take us
   back with a sufficient degree of certainty to the middle of the third
   century. Among these the most important are Novatian's tractate De
   Trinitate, [31] and the fragments from the epistles and writings of
   Bishop Dionysius of Rome. [32]

   That the shorter Roman symbol as represented in the Epistle of
   Marcellus and in the Psalterium Aethelstani was as early as about the
   year 250 the predominant one in Rome, must be regarded as one of the
   most positive results of historical investigation. Here, however, a
   series of questions arises, the answers to which involve very
   complicated investigations and the combination of different facts. The
   most important of these questions are as follow:

   1. How is the shorter Roman symbol related to the Western symbols which
   were used, between the years 250 and 500 (800), in the religious
   services of the provincial churches until they were driven out by the
   (Gallican) Symbolum Apostolicum and the Nicene-Constantinopolitan?

   2. How is the shorter Roman symbol related to the longer, that is to
   say, to the Apostles' Creed as we know it from the time of Caesarius,
   and why was it displaced by the latter?

   3. When and where did the shorter symbol originate?

   4. How is the shorter Roman symbol related to the Eastern
   pre-Constantinopolitan symbols?

   5. How is the shorter Roman symbol related to the different forms of
   the Rules of Faith with which we are familiar in the first three
   centuries?

   These five questions can be separated only in abstracto. As a matter of
   fact they are so closely interwoven, each with the others, that a
   definite and separate answer to every one of them is impossible. In
   what follows these questions will be discussed together and a general
   answer attempted.

   [20] A few of the more important of these texts may be here named: a
   Greek text in the Epistle of Marcellus of Ancyra to the Roman bishop,
   Julius, about the year 337 or 338 A.D. (Epiphan. Panar. haer. 52 (72),
   Opp. T. i. p. 836, ed. Petav.; Hahn, ibid. § 15; Caspari, op. cit. iii.
   S. 4 f., S. 28-161), and also in a MS. of the Biblioth. Cottoniana, the
   so-called Psalterium Aethelstani, saec. ix. (Hahn, § 16; Caspari, iii.
   S. 5 f., S. 161-203). The Latin text is in the Codex Laudianus 35, in
   the Bodleian Library, belonging to the sixth or seventh century
   (Caspari, iii. S. 162 f.; Hahn, § 17); also in a MS. in the British
   Museum, 2 A, xx., of about the eighth century (Swainson, The Nicene and
   Apostles' Creeds, 1875, p. 161 f.); in the Esplanatio Symboli ad
   initiandos, attributed to Ambrose or, as the case may be, to Maximus of
   Turin (A. Mai, Script. Vet. Nova Coll. T. vii. p. 156 f. 1883), B.
   Brunus, Maximi Tur. Opp. p. 30 f., 1784; Hahn, § 20; Caspari, ii. S. 48
   ff., who makes it probable that the treatise came from Ambrose. Against
   this view Kattenbusch urges some weighty considerations, which,
   however, do not seem to me conclusive; cf. also in Rufin. Expos. in
   Symb. Apost. in Opp. Cypr. Append. ed. Fell, p. 17 f. 1682; see Hahn,
   14; and also the so-called Florentine Symbol; Caspari, iv. S. 290 ff.;
   and some statements in the 24th epist. of Leo the Great (Hahn, § 18).

   [21] See the reconstruction of the text in my treatise upon the old
   Roman Symbol (Patr. Apost. Opp. 2 edit. 1, 2, 1878), and more

   Taufsymbols, Giessen, 1892; also his Apost. Symbol. S. 59 ff., where a
   recension of the Latin text is also given. The best authorities are the

   other.

III

   A survey of the provincial and private confessions which remain to us
   from the Western Church, belonging to the period from the fourth to the
   sixth (seventh) century, [33] enables us to make six very important
   observations about them:--

   1. In the choice and arrangement of the single parts they all exhibit
   the same fundamental type as the shorter Roman symbol.

   2. The shorter a Western symbol is, the more closely it approaches the
   shorter Roman symbol. The shortest symbols of the provincial churches
   of the West are almost, if not altogether, identical with it.

   3. The later a Western symbol is, the more it varies, as a rule in
   consequence of additions, [34] from the shorter Roman. With the
   exception of a few expressions, like the anti-modalistic "invisibili et
   impassibili," added to the "omnipotente," in the first article of the
   symbol of the church of Aquileia; the plerophoric "huius," as an
   addition to "carnis," in the third article of the same symbol; the
   position of "remissionem peccatorum, resurrectionem carnis et vitam
   aeternam per sanctam ecclesiam" in the Carthaginian Church (this
   arrangement, however, may be explained otherwise), none of these
   additions are of a directly polemical nature, but are to be regarded as
   completions and extensions held to be necessary in the interest of a
   clear understanding of the Creed. With these may be compared the
   manifold and various additions to the first article of the old symbol,
   for example: [35] the formula "natus de Spiritu Sancto ex Virgine
   Maria," in the symbol of Aquileia and Ravenna; the formula "conceptus
   de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Virgine M." in the symbol of Faustus of
   Rietz; the differentiation of "crucifixus" into "passus . . .
   crucifixus" in the later symbols; the addition of "catholicam," in the
   third article in the Spanish and Carthaginian symbols as well as in
   that of Nicetas; the addition of "vitam aeternam" for example, in
   Augustine's symbol and in Faustus of Rietz; and so on. The fundamental
   character of the symbols is not altered by such additions, as they are
   not of a speculative or dogmatic nature.

   4. The majority of the additions which the Western symbols exhibit are
   of such a character that they may be regarded as intermediate steps
   between the shorter and longer Roman symbol. This consideration,
   however, is not so important as the fact that the great provincial
   churches of the West in the third and fourth centuries, by the
   additions which they severally made, stamped the symbols with a
   definite character. Four such types can be readily distinguished,
   namely, the Italian, the African, the Gallican, which includes the
   Irish, and the Spanish. [36] As for the Gallican type which is seen in
   our Apostles' Creed, one of its distinguishing features is that it is
   characterised by such historical additions as are to be found in the
   earlier Oriental Rules of Faith or symbols, as the case may be, such as
   "creator of heaven and earth," "suffered," "died," "descended into
   hell"; and also the predicate "catholic." The Gallican type in its
   final form is not in every respect the richest or the longest of the
   Western symbols; but in so far as its historical contents are
   concerned, it certainly is so. What gives it its peculiar character is
   the fact that. with the richest material contents it lacks all those
   finishing touches or elements of accurate definition which are present
   in other symbols of provincial churches, such as "invisibilem et
   impassibilem" in the first article; "omnium creaturarum visibilium et
   invisibilium conditorem" and "unum," in the first and second; "Deum" in
   the second; "resurrexit vivus, omnium peccatorum, cum gloria venturus,
   per baptismum," in the third; "huius carnis, etc." In these important
   respects the final form of the Gallican type, that is, of our Apostles'
   Creed, has completely preserved the distinguishing features of the old
   Roman symbol. It exhibits the same compact and severe style, and
   nevertheless also preserves all the significant historical features
   that became attached to the Symbolum Romanum in the course of its
   career. The Gallican Apostles' Creed also exhibits the same classical
   elaboration as its Roman predecessor, and like it was regarded as
   possessing the same ecumenical authority.

   5. The less any church was influenced by the church at Rome, the more
   significant become the progressive variations of its creed from the
   shorter Roman symbol. The symbols of the Gallican Church are relatively
   far removed from it.

   6. If all the Western symbols be reduced to an archetype, and the
   differences be disregarded, we arrive without difficulty at the shorter
   Roman creed.

   What conclusions are we to draw from these observations? The evidence
   justifies the assertions (1) that the shorter Roman symbol was the
   source of all the Western confessions of faith; and (2) that the longer
   Roman symbol was gradually developed from the other, and as a
   consequence also preserved the same attributes as originally
   characterised the shorter symbol. But the process did not take place in
   Rome.

   From the first conclusion we may reasonably infer that the shorter
   Roman symbol must have originated considerably earlier than the middle
   of the third century. Otherwise how can we explain the fact that all
   the Western churches originally used the same symbol, and that the
   African Church, for example, had already developed its own special
   type, before the year 250, upon the foundation afforded by the old
   Roman symbol? [37] Accordingly we must refer the Roman symbol to a date
   at least as early as the year 200, which admits of positive proof from
   the writings of Tertullian. Moreover, this conclusion is established by
   a comparison between the shorter Roman symbol and all the Western
   confessions of faith on the one side, and the provincial and private
   symbols of the East on the other; and, further, by a comparison of the
   shorter Roman symbol with the different editions of the Rule of Faith
   up to the middle of the third century.

   The Eastern baptismal confessions are distinguished one and all by
   great flexibility, by freedom in form, and by richness of expression.
   [38] As the Eastern Church never knew anything of any of the creeds
   having been composed by the Apostles, it always dealt with them in a
   much freer spirit, and in its baptismal confession gave expression at
   one and the same time to its interest in speculative theology and to
   its horror of every kind of heresy. It was mostly in the East that
   heresy originated. Thus the Eastern Church often puts dogmatic in the
   place of historical expressions, omits important passages, largely
   extends others by additional and preliminary matter, and interpolates
   anti-Gnostic, anti-Monarchian, anti-Modalistic, anti-Arian,
   anti-Semiarian, anti-Marcellian, anti-Photinian, anti-Pneumatomachian,
   anti-Apollinarian, and other observations. "The Oriental symbols
   frequently exhibit in their separate articles a greater or less freedom
   of form, whether by inserting dogmatic in place of simple historical
   expressions or by uniting the two, or by expressing the article in
   question in a somewhat fuller manner, or, finally, by making one or
   more additions not of a distinctly anti-heretical character. . . .
   Further, we often find that they contain whole articles wanting in the
   Western baptismal confessions. . . . As a general result the Eastern
   confessions exhibit, some in a higher and some in a less degree, a
   subjective, reflective and dogmatic character. They wear, moreover, a
   more or less parti-coloured appearance, and are more or less prolix,
   diffuse and verbose." Lastly, catechetical instruction in doctrine,
   which, as is well known, was an accompaniment of the baptismal
   confession in the East, was much more strongly influenced by
   dogmatico-polemical theories than in the West. In the Eastern Church
   the symbol was accordingly in a constant condition of flux and
   movement. Not until the adoption of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed
   was this state of things altered, and not even then was it completely
   altered. The Nicene Creed alone did not do it. From about the year 430
   onwards this latter symbol supplanted the others in such parts of the
   territory of the orthodox Church as lay beyond the imperial
   jurisdiction. From that time the Byzantine Church became the home of
   severe conservatism in regard to the Creed, as up to the present day it
   has clung, persistently and exclusively, to the Nicene Creed. This
   state of things, which lasted in the East up to the middle of the fifth
   century, renders it difficult to describe the general characteristics
   of the Eastern symbols in their universality, and to reduce them to any
   fundamental type. Yet this much may be said: (1) That a considerable
   number of Eastern symbols--not all, [39] but certainly those of Syria
   and Palestine--are based on the same type; [40] (2) that in its range
   and the disposition of its articles this type exhibits an affinity with
   the shorter Roman symbol, but also the following variations from it:
   [41] 1. pisteuomen is almost always used, and in many symbols it is
   repeated with each article. 2. In the first and second article hena is
   added to theon and to kurion. 3. In the first article, God is
   designated as the Creator of all things, that is, of Heaven and Earth.
   4. The position of the words in the beginning of the second article is
   as follows: kai eis hena (ton) kurion Ies. Chr. ton huion autou ton
   monogene In the Western symbol the words Chr. Ies. stand first; ton
   huion autou ton monogene follow, and only after them comes ton kurion.
   This order is almost everywhere preserved, and hemon is added to
   kurion. 5. Frequently "ek spermatos Dabid," or something similar, is
   added to the phrase gennethenta ktl. 6. In the East the separate
   clauses of the second article are run together, polysyndetically; in
   the West, asyndetically; there, the affirmations regarding Christ take
   the form of sentences placed in juxtaposition; here, of relative
   sentences. 7. The article ton epi Pontiou Pmlatou staurothenta kai
   taphenta is almost entirely lacking; here and there it appears in a
   modified form. 8. The words te trite hemera are placed after anastanta.
   9. Instead of anabanta, anelthonta or analephthenta is used. 10. The
   article concerning the "coming again," is co-ordinated with the
   preceding. 11. Meta doxes or endoxos is added to palin erchomenon. 12.
   In the third article the reading is to pneuma to hagion, or t. ha. p.
   to prophetikon or something similar is often added. 13. ekklesia has
   the predicate katholike after the other predicate hagia. Where the
   former appears in the later Western symbols, it stands after
   "Ecclesiam." 14. Baptism is frequently mentioned in the third article.
   15. The words zoen aionion are found almost everywhere.

   All these characteristics, however, attach to a set of symbols
   dependent on the symbol of Nicaea, or, as the case may be, on that on
   which it was based (the symbol which Eusebius laid before the Council
   at Nicaea, usually called the Caesarean); also on Lucian's. This
   symbol, therefore, is not older than the beginning of the fourth
   century. The assertion would, of course, be open to challenge if the
   symbol produced by Eusebius were the baptismal confession of the Church
   of Caesarea. [42] But the connexion in which Eusebius communicates the
   symbol in his letter to his community makes it anything but probable
   that it is the symbol or baptismal confession of that place. It ought,
   rather, to be regarded as a symbol which Eusebius had constructed
   expressly for the existing situation, [43] not, of course, ab ovo but
   according to the formulas familiar at Antioch or, as the case may be,
   in the schools of Origen and Lucian. [44] That the congregation at
   Caesarea in the course of its instruction heard the faith which
   Eusebius here formulated is certain; but whether, over and above the
   baptismal confession, it possessed a definite creed consisting of three
   divisions is very questionable. Any such contention is strongly
   rebutted by the fact that in Eusebius' formula the third article simply
   consists of pisteuomen kai eis hen pneuma hagion. The assumption that
   Eusebius made any omission from the church confession is a very
   dangerous one to make. There is also the fact that a long-winded
   sentence follows, [45] ending in the general order to baptize. Eusebius
   regards this as belonging to the confession of faith as much as what
   preceded it: touton hekaston einai kai huparchein pisteuontes, patera
   alethos patera kai huion alethos huion kai pneuma hagion alethos pneuma
   hagion, kathos ho kurios hemon apostellon eis to kerugma tous heautou
   mathetas eipe; poreuthentes matheteusate panta ta ethne, baptizontes
   autous eis to onoma tou patros ktl. This is evidently the reason why
   Eusebius as well as Lucian went on to the baptismal confession and
   repeated it in extenso; he felt the necessity of presenting his new
   formula as a paraphrase of the formula known to the community. But if
   the Caesarean symbol is not one framed for a particular community, then
   we know absolutely nothing of any definite, detailed, ancient communal
   symbols in the East of any date preceding the Nicene Creed. This
   negative conclusion is confirmed by four considerations: (1) by the
   curious symbol of Gregory Thaumaturgus, [46] and the equally curious
   one of Aphraates. [47] The argument seems to me unassailable that,
   where such "symbols" as these can be constructed, there is as yet no
   communal symbol, such as the Roman, in existence; and Gregory knew the
   Eastern Church from Pontus to Egypt. (2) By the free and easy way in
   which the symbols were formed and also accepted in the East. With pain
   and astonishment we see this process going on in the fourth and down to
   the middle of the fifth century. If any old symbols had been in
   existence, which had come down from previous generations, how could
   this state of chaotic confusion and lack of reverence in the formation
   and acceptance of creeds in the East be explained? (3) By the
   above-mentioned typical similarity of structure exhibited in the
   Eastern symbols of the fourth century, where the type of the
   Lucian-Eusebean-Nicene creed is almost the only one which emerges. (4)
   By the uncertainty about the third article which prevailed in the East
   up to the middle of the fourth century. Even as late as the first
   Antiochian formula of the year 341 it runs as follows: ei de dei
   prostheinai pisteuomen kai peri sarkos anastaseos k. zoes aioniou.

   In connexion with this last point I may observe that the construction
   of the old Roman symbol is perfectly clear. It is based on the
   baptismal formula with its three divisions. The first division is
   defined by the words, "God Almighty"; the second is characterised by
   the phrases "Only Begotten Son" and "Our Lord," as well as by the
   historical account which it gives; the third is conceived of as a gift,
   and hence three further blessings are associated with it, which
   together express the content of the salvation which faith brings. Of
   the thirty Eastern confessions of faith from the fourth century which
   come into question more than two-thirds contain either no third article
   at all or else only a bare confession of belief in the Holy Ghost.
   Putting aside the symbols derived from the Nicene-Constantinopolitan,
   [48] and also the obviously abridged symbols mentioned by Hahn, §§ 71,
   72, [49] we find that the only symbol containing the third article in a
   complete form, or the more than complete form which mentions Baptism,
   is that in the seventh book of the Apostolic Constitutions, in the
   symbol handed by Arius to the Emperor, in that of Cyril of Jerusalem,
   in the symbol of Salamis (which developed into the Constantinopolitan),
   and in the longer symbol of Epiphanius. [50] These five symbols
   evidently go back to one common root, which is most visible in Cyril's
   form, although it certainly does not easily lend itself to
   reconstruction. But in the close affinity which it exhibits with the
   old Roman symbol this very symbol takes precedence of all the rest. The
   relationship is so close that Cyril's symbol can only be the daughter
   or the sister of the Roman one. That it can have been the mother is out
   of the question, as the Roman symbol undoubtedly reveals an older and
   simpler form. Hitherto there has been no reason for regarding it as
   even a sister, for the date of this set of Palestino-Syrian symbols is
   not earlier than the beginning of the fourth century, whilst we can
   certainly place the old Roman symbol a century earlier. Now, as regards
   the more than twenty Eastern symbols which possess only a rudimentary
   third article or none at all, it is clear from the way in which
   christological attributes are accumulated, even in the oldest of them,
   that we are dealing with symbols of late origin. Still, however, the
   formula theos pater pantokrator, and the structure of the
   christological section, unmistakably exhibit a certain affinity with
   the Roman symbol. Moreover they almost all possess, in common with the
   former group, additions to the first article, as well as the hena in
   the first and second. Finally, there is a certain grammatical and
   literary character common to them all. Hence the simplest solution of
   the problem presented by the relation between the Eastern confessions
   of faith of the fourth century and the old Roman symbol, is to say
   that, whilst there was no established baptismal confession of faith in
   the East in the third century, there was, however, an old, flexible
   "christological rule," and also old, ceremonial or polemical formulas
   of belief in One God the Creator, and in His Only Son Christ. Apart
   from the singular confession of Gregory Thaumaturgus, the venturesome
   character of which is apparent in the very extravagances of the legend
   connected with it, we may say that it was towards the end of the third
   century, probably in the school of Lucian, at all events at some point
   in Syria-Palestine, that the formation of symbols began in the East,
   where men--first, it seems, in theological circles--had come to know
   and value the Roman symbol. At the period of the struggles with Paul of
   Samosata other features of the Roman Church also came to be
   appreciated. The direct and full acceptance of the Roman symbol was,
   however, hindered by (1) the circumstance that the christological
   section of the Roman symbol came into conflict with a christological
   type already established; (2) by the desire to give fuller expression
   to the "higher christology" in the creed. It was not until the time of
   the Arian controversy that fixed symbols in the East began to be
   formed. The type [51] that was apparently, at least, the most frequent
   up to the year 381, was that with the short third article (in "the,"
   or, as the case might be, the "One," "Holy Ghost"; or also, in some
   instances, with additions such as "Who spake by the Prophets"); whilst
   the type which, in the third article, is in essential agreement with
   the old Roman symbol came to the front in the Jerusalem-Salamis symbol,
   and in that contained in the seventh book of the Apostolic
   Constitutions, [52] and then gradually gained the supremacy through the
   Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed.

   The question may be asked whether this conclusion is not upset by an
   examination of the Rules of Faith, and the fragments of those rules and
   formula-like sentences with which we are familiar as belonging to the
   Eastern half of the Church from the middle of the first to the middle
   of the third century. This is the opinion entertained by Caspari, Zahn,
   Loofs, and many others, and formerly I, too, shared it. The idea is
   that we must take an Eastern symbol or, to be more precise, a symbol
   from Asia Minor, and relate the old Roman symbol to it as daughter or
   sister. The assumption rests principally if not exclusively oft what we
   find in Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, Justin and Ignatius. The
   opponents of this view argue briefly as follows:--"The writings of
   Justin, who was baptized in Ephesus about the year 130, show us that he
   assumes the existence of a symbol which on the one hand much resembles
   the old Roman, and on the other is most characteristically
   distinguished from it. These distinguishing marks also appear in the
   majority of the later Eastern symbols (Iesous Christos not Ch. I.;
   staurotheis epi P. P. not epi P. P st.; apothanonta; palin meta doxes
   etc.); further, they are also to be found in the formulas of Irenaeus,
   who employs others as well as hena, poieten ouranou kai ges, and in
   certain peculiarities of style which may also be shown to exist in
   Eastern symbols of the fourth century. Some of these can be traced back
   as far as Ignatius, nay, even to the Epistles of St. Paul, or, in fact,
   to the New Testament in general. Finally, it follows from what Clement
   says that in his time there existed a formal and fixed baptismal
   confession in Alexandria. In the East, then, there existed in the
   second century a fixed symbol, or, rather, many symbols, related to the
   Roman symbol, but independent of it. The history of Eastern symbols may
   therefore be traced well into the second century, and this history,
   accordingly, though latent in the third century, was still existent.
   The Roman symbol at best is contemporaneous with the Asiatic or Syrian;
   more probably it is later; and this Asiatic or Syrian symbol leaves it
   free to the critic to assign it to the years 120-130, 100-120, or
   70-100." Such is the argument.

   Against it four considerations may be urged:

   (1) The fact that single sentences seem to be echoes of the symbol or
   tally with it offers no guarantee that they themselves derive from one
   symbol. Before any symbol existed God was pantokrator; Jesus Christ was
   called "the Only Begotten Son, our Lord"; he was proclaimed as "born of
   the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary," as having suffered under Pontius
   Pilate, and as coming to judge the quick and the dead.

   (2) Formula-like sentences, if not obviously a part of the baptismal
   formula, need not necessarily have originated in a baptismal
   confession, even though they be identical with the sentences of that
   confession. The oldest tradition gave a fixed or, as the case may be, a
   more fixed shape to "The Faith," not only in the form of a baptismal
   confession and for the purposes of baptism, but also in (a) liturgical
   sentences, (b) formulas of exorcism, (c) precepts concerning faith and
   morals, and (d) historical summaries, and that, too, with a view to the
   most diverse objects (instruction, apologetics, polemics, religious
   worship). As illustrating (a) we may take the prayers in the Didaché;
   (b) statements in Justin and others; (c) Hermas, Mand. 1 and Didaché
   1-6; (d) 1 Cor. xv. 1 ff., Mark xvi. 9 ff. The words of John xvii. 3
   hina ginoskosi se ton monon alethinon theon kai hon apesteilas I. Chr.
   were in the middle of the second century as much a formula of faith as
   Hermas, Mand. 1 proton panton pisteuson, hoti heis estin theos ktl.,
   yet they have nothing to do with the baptismal formula. Such passages
   as Ephes. iv. 9 furnished themes for homiletical discourses; formulas
   were also set up which led from the confession of the One God to the
   chief practical commandments; of these some fine and powerful examples
   are found in Mand. 1 ff. and Didaché 1 ff. Finally, the preaching of
   Christ is not unfrequently attached, on the foundation of numerous
   Pauline passages, to a confession of belief in the One God, without any
   mention of the Holy Spirit, of the Church, or of Christian blessings.

   (3) In particular, the preaching of Christ, apart from the detailed
   form which it received in the Gospels, [53] also underwent various
   longer or shorter epitomisations, [54] which took a fixed form without
   being placed in a Trinitarian framework. These epitomisations proceeded
   on various plans: (a) the mere chronicle, (b) the chronicle with proofs
   attached, (c) the plan of fulfilled prophecy, (d) the plan kata sarka
   kata pneuma, (e) the plan of the first and second coming, (f) the plan
   katabas--anabas. All these plans, in part united with one another,
   issued in affirmations of a character relatively fixed, even if capable
   of being modified.

   (4) Out of the great number of predicates attached to God, Christ, and
   the Spirit, some which were in general use very soon came to the front,
   apart from the detailed Trinitarian confession. Those chiefly used in
   connexion with God are, heis, pantokrator, pater, despotes and Creator,
   with additions; with Christ, ho huios tou theou, ho kurios, soter,
   didaskalos, monogenes, heis, logos; with the Holy Ghost agios,
   prophetikos. In the same way, out of the great number of blessings
   which the Christian faith affords, some are named with especial
   frequency, such as aphesis hamartion (with or without mention of
   baptism), zoe (aionios), anastasis (with or without tes sarkos),
   gnosis, aphtharsia, etc. Everything thus variously produced was
   regarded as "the Faith," "the Rule of Faith," "Kerugma" (or
   "Proclamation"), "Truth," "Rule of Truth," mathema, paradosis,
   taradotheis logos, didache, etc.

   A consideration of the facts contained in the foregoing, the truth of
   which no scholar will question, must make us very cautious in arguing
   from formula-like confessional sentences to a formulated baptismal
   confession in three parts. Caution of this kind seems to be everywhere
   wanting at the present time, as is seen, for example, in Zahn's
   treatise on the Apostles' Creed (1893) and in the way in which it has
   been received by the most distinguished students in this branch of
   learning. No one has a right to claim a particular proposition, which
   forms no part of any creed framed on the Trinitarian plan, as part of a
   fixed baptismal confession, unless he is in a position to offer very
   strong evidence for his contention.

   What is the net result of the "testimony" of Ignatius, Justin,
   Irenaeus, and Clement of Alexandria?

   (1) We find that Ignatius has freely reproduced a "kerugma" of Christ
   which seems, in essentials, to be of a fairly definite historical
   character and which contained, inter alia, the Virgin Birth, Pontius
   Pilate and the apethanen. There is no trace of any evidence, however,
   that it was part of any creed based on the Trinitarian plan.

   (2) As to Justin we find (a) that he knew of a definite christological
   "kerugma," and used it again and again; this was closely related to the
   second article of the Roman symbol, although quite independent of it,
   and it even exhibits many of the characteristic peculiarities of the
   later Eastern symbols; (b) that with him this "kerugma" forms no part
   of any baptismal symbol, that is to say, is not a formal second
   article; (c) that with him the baptismal formula was not developed into
   a symbol at all, except that the three Persons were described as
   follows: ho pater ton holon kai despotes theos, Iesous Christos ho
   staurotheis epi Pontiou Pilatou, to pneuma hagion ho dia ton propheton
   proekeruxe ta kata ton Iesoun panta, or, simply, to prophetikon any
   such description, however, in the baptismal formula itself, is
   improbable; (d) that it is extremely likely that the christological
   "kerugma" above indicated was formally stated as fulfilled prophecy,
   that is to say, stood as part of a plan as follows: "The Holy Ghost
   prophesied etc."; but we can go no farther in this direction than the
   assumption that Justin knew of a "kerugma"; that after the mention of
   pater ton holon kai despotes, and Jesus Christ, a "kerugma" of Christ,
   in the form of fulfilled prophecy or, as the case may be, in the form
   of a belief in the prophetic spirit, was added. But the contention that
   this mathema was a baptismal confession, or, as the case may be,
   claimed to be a developed baptismal formula, and that it existed in a
   crystallised form at all, is unsupported by any evidence.

   (3) As regards Irenaeus, (a) as I have shown in the first article
   against Zahn in the Zeitschrift für Theologie und Kirche, Bd. iv. S.
   149 ff., we must be very cautious in drawing conclusions from his
   "testimonies on behalf of the baptismal confession"; a very small
   portion of the material which I collected from Irenaeus in the treatise
   on the old Roman symbol [55] is sufficient to determine the "symbol"
   which he employed; (b) according to Irenaeus i. 9, 4 baptism bestows
   the kanon tes aletheias; this canon he himself communicates in i. 10,
   1. The form in which he here produces it, supplemented by the
   watchwords of his theology, and given in other places with fragmentary
   variations, shows that he is compiling it independently out of a large
   number of fixed confessional formulas of the Church. Among these may be
   distinguished:

   i. The expanded formula of Hermas. [56]

   2. The formula heis theos pantokrator united with Johannine expressions
   or, as the case may be, with pepoiekos t. ouranon k. t. gen k. t.
   thalassas kai panta t. en autois, or heis monogenes Iesous Christos.

   3. A christological formula of confession (in an historical form),
   showing a close relation to the old Roman symbol, but a still closer
   one to Justin's.

   4. The theos pater pantokrator of the Roman symbol.

   5. A formula of confession which to the confession of belief in the One
   God and One Christ Jesus joined a confession of belief in the Holy
   Spirit, and incorporated with this confession the history of Christ as
   fulfilled prophecy. As we were enabled to make a similar conjecture in
   Justin's case, so it is probable that not only in Irenaeus' time but
   also in Justin's a confessional formula existed in the East containing
   something like the following:--he eis hena theon pantokratora (or eis
   ton patera ton holon kai despoten theon) pisstis kai eis hena Iesoun
   Christon ton huion tou theou, ton sarkothenta huper hemon (or huper tes
   hemeteras soterias) kai eis pneuma hagion, to dia ton propheton
   kekeruchos tas oikonomias, ten ek parthenou gennesin ktl. From this
   formula, which Irenaeus made the foundation of his kanon tes aletheias,
   the historico-christological formula of confession containing the
   sentences about the birth, suffering under Pontius Pilate, burial,
   resurrection, and coming again in glory (in finite verb or, as the case
   may be, participle) is perhaps, or even probably, to be distinguished.
   Parallels are also to be found for this formula in Justin and Ignatius
   or, as the case may be, in 1 Cor. xv. This is as far as the material
   hitherto discovered will allow us to go on this subject. That Irenaeus
   assumed the existence of a symbol, or, in other words, that the
   formulas (plans) indicated above were in existence in their
   crystallised form, not only cannot be demonstrated but is entirely
   improbable. Irenaeus' whole line of argument must have issued in a
   different conclusion had there existed in a fixed form, recognised in
   his community, what is necessary for his demonstration, that "Multa,"
   that is to say, many familiar formulas and short statements of faith,
   existed, but no "Multum," that is to say, that there was no symbol.
   There is nothing in the objection that Tertullian proceeds in a similar
   way, and that he certainly assumes the Roman symbol to be already
   known. Tertullian's references to a symbol are incomparably clearer.
   [57] But that he had to serve up to his readers as Apostolic tradition
   the quid pro quo, that is to say, formulas constructed ad hoc, followed
   from the fact that the text of the Roman symbol was insufficient for
   the theological and anti-Gnostic objects which he had in view. We may,
   however, ask whether the Irenaeus of Asia Minor and Gaul had ever heard
   of the Roman symbol. In view of the distinct formula theos pater
   pantokrator, and the way in which he uses the Roman community as
   evidence in his argument for tradition, I am disposed to assume that he
   had.

   Lastly, as regards Clement of Alexandria, there is a still unsettled
   controversy as to whether he does not in one place assume the existence
   of a fixed symbol in that city. Even if this be so--it seems to me
   still extremely doubtful--there is no art which can discover how this
   symbol ran. It may have been something entirely different from what we
   call a symbol. Therefore we may leave it out of account.

   That there existed in Asia Minor, or in Syria, or, in short, in the
   East before the beginning of the third century, symbols used as
   baptismal confessions which were based upon the baptismal formula, gave
   the second article in the form of an historical account, and summarised
   in the third the blessings which faith receives, cannot be shown. To
   prove the existence in the East at all, in the earliest period, of any
   fixed crystallised confession, and therefore of a primitive Eastern
   symbol closely related to the old Roman one, but still independent of
   it, is impossible. Not only can the existence of any such primitive
   symbol not be proved, but it is quite improbable, as the history of the
   Eastern Church shows in the third century by its silence, and in the
   fourth by what it says. Nevertheless the result of our investigations
   is not merely negative. On the contrary, we can agree that those who
   defend the existence of a primitive typical Eastern symbol are, up to a
   certain point, right. There did actually exist in the East (in Asia
   Minor or, as the case may be, Asia Minor and Syria), as early as the
   beginning of the second century, inter alia a christological mathema,
   which is most intimately related to the second article of the Roman
   creed, and which, as regards the formulas and details peculiar to it,
   made its way into the Eastern symbols of the fourth century. There
   existed, further, formulas referring to One God, the Creator of Heaven
   and Earth, and to His Incarnate Son, which also made their way, and
   exerted an influence on the whole process of forming symbols, including
   many modifications of the Roman symbols in the West. The exclusively
   theological tenor of the Eastern symbols in the second article may be
   traced to the primitive sarkothenta. Finally, there existed a formula
   which asserted of the holy prophetic Spirit the facts which it
   proclaimed in regard to Christ. Apart from these leading formulas the
   words "descensus" and "catholica" point to the East. But nevertheless
   the great feat of having formed the symbol, and of therewith laying the
   foundation of all ecclesiastical symbols, remains the glory of the
   community at Rome.

   When did this happen? We have traced the old Roman symbol to the time
   of Tertullian. It is this symbol that he means when he writes de
   praescr. haer. 36: "Si autem Italiae adjaces, habes Romam, unde nobis
   quoque auctoritas praesto est . . . videamus quid didicerit, quid
   docuerit, cum Africanis quoque ecclesiis contesserarit. Unum deum
   dominum novit, creatorem universitatis, et Christum Jesum ex Virgine
   Maria filium dei creatoris et carnis resurrectionem . . . et ita
   adversus hanc institutionem neminem recipit." This symbol we
   unhesitatingly trace back to about the middle of the second century.
   Had a symbol been established in Rome at the time of the fierce
   struggle with Gnosticism and Marcionism (about 145-190), it would have
   taken a different form; on the other hand, to go back too far beyond
   the middle of the second century is unwise. There are a great many
   things in the Shepherd of Hermas, both as a whole and in its several
   parts, which would be difficult to explain if the Roman symbol had been
   familiar to the writer. Justin shows us that about the middle of the
   second century the distinction between ek and dia Marias had not yet
   been effected. The omission of Jesus' baptism by John, and also of the
   Johannine expression huios monogenes, the omission of the chiliastic
   hopes, and the sharp distinction between anastanta, anabanta and
   kathemenon, are facts to be seriously weighed. In addition, the
   expression theos pater pantokrator has no history behind it, and it
   gradually displaced an older expression heis theos pantokrator. This I
   have already shown in the Zeitschrift für Theologie and Kirche, [58] in
   which I refuted Zahn's hypothesis that the old Roman symbol originally
   began with the words pisteuo heis hena theon pantokratora. The old
   Roman symbol always ran as it now runs, but the text of its first
   article must have made its way in opposition to an older and very
   wide-spread form of the confession of God as the Creator. To Hermas the
   formula theos pater pantokrator is as yet unknown. This also makes it
   probable that the symbol originated about the middle of the second
   century or shortly before. The text, too, of the Eastern christological
   mathema, which was presumably known to the author of the old Roman
   symbol, is, if it contains Jesus' Baptism by John and does not mention
   the Ascension, older than the Roman symbol, just as the pathonta,
   apothanonta, as well as palin and en doxe, can be put a long way back.
   Finally, if we examine the Roman symbol clause by clause, the following
   facts are established:

   (1) The symbol itself is the oldest witness for the formula theos pater
   pantokrator, which gradually superseded an older form.

   (2) huios ho monogenes is Johannine.

   (3) The oldest and frequently recurring formula for the Virgin birth
   always runs gennethenta ek Marias tes parthenou. The addition of ek
   pneumatos hagiou in the "kerugmatic" sentences is relatively late, and
   presumably comes from the Gospels.

   (4) The taphenta there is in like manner late.

   (5) The addition of te trite hemera to anastanta. Both come from the
   First Epistle to the Corinthians.

   (6) The special prominence given to anabanta between anastanta and
   kathemenon is also relatively late, and shows a desire for completeness
   which is best explained by the high regard felt for the only existing
   account. [59]

   (7) The enumeration of the blessings of salvation, as given in the
   third article, cannot be understood apart from the Pauline Epistles,
   but it lends a precision to what was taken from those Epistles by the
   particular prominence given to the Resurrection as a Resurrection of
   the body. The fact that in the Roman symbol older and shorter
   "kerugmatic" sentences were somewhat further developed under the
   influence of the New Testament writings, and particularly under that of
   John, the Synoptists, Paul, and probably the Acts of the Apostles,
   makes it unwise to trace the composition of the symbol backwards beyond
   the middle of the second century.

   To sum up: the symbol originated in Rome about the middle of the second
   century. It was based upon the baptismal formula and on confessional
   formulas of a summarising character (such as we can identify from the
   New Testament and from Ignatius, Justin, and Irenaeus), which had been
   generally handed down, including Eastern formulas (Asia Minor, Syria),
   as also largely under the influence of the New Testament writings.
   Among these confessional formulas the most important was a
   christological mathema of fairly fixed form, yet capable of being added
   to and modified. Its main outlines, I presume, are recognisable. In
   Rome itself the Roman symbol was never altered. It made its way into
   the Western provinces from the end of the second century onwards,
   without raising any claim to have been, in the strictest sense,
   composed by the Apostles. That is why it underwent different
   modifications in those provinces. (In Rome it was not until some time
   between 250 and 350 onwards that it was designated as Apostolic in the
   strict sense of the term.) Amongst these modifications, those became
   historically the most important which derive from the primitive
   confessional formulas of the East or, as the case may be, the mathema,
   namely, "creator of heaven and earth," "suffered," "died," "descended
   into hell," "eternal life," besides the "catholica"--these are just the
   modifications traceable in the Gallic symbols which issue in our
   Apostles' Creed--in addition, the "conceptus," which is obscure in its
   origin and otherwise of little importance, and, most perplexing of all,
   the "communio sanctorum." In this connexion may rightly be borne in
   mind the particularly close relations existing between Southern Gaul
   and the East. But an historical circumstance of very special importance
   seems also to have played a part. Hitherto I have said nothing about
   the Symbol of Nicetas. [60] Morin [61] has made it very probable that
   Nicetas means the Nicetas of Remesiana in Dacia, the friend of Paulinus
   of Nola. [62] The symbol which he adduces can unhappily be no longer
   reconstructed in detail from his Explanatio; but so much is certain,
   that it is closely related to the old Roman symbol. What is much more
   interesting, however, is the fact that throughout (partly word by word)
   he explains it by the catechising activity of Cyril of Jerusalem, and
   in this connexion brings in the sentence "Ergo in hac una ecclesia
   crede to communionem consecuturum esse sanctorum." Whether the
   catchwords belong to Nicetas' symbol is very questionable (to me
   improbable); but in any case, so far as their origin is concerned,
   their presence there could be explained by reference to Cyril's words.
   As there is a certain relationship between Nicetas' symbol and the
   Gallican (we may ask whether his symbol was not even influenced by
   Cyril's), and as connexions between Gaul and Pannonia are not lacking,
   the possibility presents itself--more than this I will not say at
   present--of conceiving the Gallican symbol, with the clause "communio
   sanctorum," that is to say, our Apostles' Creed, as having arisen about
   the year 500 under the indirect influence of Cyril's catechising
   (carried on throughout the Remesiana in Pannonia and Aquileia). Loofs
   [63] and I [64] have indicated this possibility independently of each
   other. At all events a piece of ecclesiastical "ecumenicity" adheres to
   a part of the additions which distinguish our Apostles' Creed from the
   old Roman symbol. If "communio sanctorum" is not to be traced to Cyril,
   but to be regarded, rather, as a product of chance, it must be
   understood in Augustine's sense (i.e., the Church as the community of
   the Saints), or, with Faustus of Rietz, as a fellowship with the
   martyrs and specially holy men. Zahn [65] has recently suggested
   another derivation, namely, that "communio sanctorum" is equivalent to
   ten koinonian ton hagion, the latter meaning "sacramenta." Sub judice
   lis est."

   That the Roman Church after the beginning of the sixth century
   gradually let itself be separated from and finally robbed of the symbol
   which it had previously guarded so faithfully, is a striking phenomenon
   which has not yet had its causes clearly explained. Meanwhile, however,
   Caspari [66] has made some very important contributions towards a
   solution of the problem. The most critical fact that it was not in the
   first instance the longer (Gallican) daughter edition (our Apostles'
   Creed) which displaced the mother symbol but the
   Nicene-Constantinopolitan, which from the beginning of the sixth
   century first took the place of the shorter one in Rome in the Traditio
   and Redditio symboli, while in the baptismal interrogation the old
   Roman still remained in use. The displacement of the old Roman symbol
   by the Constantinopolitan becomes very intelligible, as soon as we
   consider the conditions of the time. From the end of the fifth century,
   under the dominion of Odoacer and the Ostrogoths, Arianism had impinged
   upon the Roman Church, and had become a danger to it. By way of
   counteracting it the Roman Church will have resolved to give up its
   ancient practice, so as in its very baptismal formula to express its
   disavowal of Arianism. When three centuries later the church returned
   to a shorter symbol, the old Roman one had already retreated into the
   background, and the new Roman symbol, which was, in fact, the Gallican,
   the Apostles' Creed, possessed the recommendation of having a series of
   elaborations which were wanting in the earlier one, and which now
   seemed indispensable. But we may probably also assume--direct
   information we have, of course, none--that the Roman Church would have
   difficulties about accepting the Frankish symbol as a baptismal one,
   had it not been recognised as an old acquaintance. It is, moreover,
   very probable that there was still enough historical tradition present
   in Rome to allow of the Frankish confession reminding people of one
   that was old and once highly honoured. The differences were overlooked
   or else not regarded as considerable. Thus the legend which had
   encircled the old symbol with a halo of glory awoke again around the
   new one, and again and for a long time became a power in the Church.
   Not until the age of the Renaissance and the Reformation was it
   exploded.

IV

   In interpreting the Apostles' Creed historically the foregoing
   observations supply us with the rule that those portions of it which
   were already a part of the old Roman confession are to be explained
   from the theology of the later Apostolic and post-Apostolic ages, not
   simply, as some claim, from the New Testament. This explanation must
   take note of the fact that the symbol is an elaborated baptismal
   formula, [67] and therefore it must not be regarded in its ancient form
   as in any way an expression of intra-church polemics, but rather as a
   Christian confession, framed with the object of giving instruction in
   Christianity, as distinguished from Judaism and Heathenism. [68] In the
   course of history, the theological explanation of the symbol naturally
   keeps pace, in the main, with the general development of dogmatics and
   theology. But the distinction between theological rules of faith and a
   confession serving for Christian instruction is always clear to Western
   consciousness, and is characteristically reflected in the Explanationes
   Symboli. As regards the phrases which we find in the Apostles' Creed
   but not in the old Roman one, we must ascertain when, where, and under
   what conditions they first appeared. Of most of them it may be said
   that they are a natural elaboration of the old symbol, that they do not
   alter its character, that they contain only the common faith of the
   Church, even of the Church of the second century, and that at the end
   of the second century they were also known to the churches of the West,
   even though they had not yet found a stable place in any of the
   provincial symbols. [69] Two only of the additions made cannot be so
   regarded; these are the phrases "descendit ad inferna" in the second
   article, and "sanctorum communionem" in the third. "Catholicam" is in a
   different case. [70] The first phrase appears in the West at the
   earliest in the symbol of Aquileia as given by Rufinus. [71] The second
   has been discussed above. At all events. the first is so far in a
   better position in that there is a clear tradition supporting it, which
   goes back far into the second century. In Marcion' s time the
   "descensus ad inferos" formed a part of the church teaching. [72] I am
   therefore disposed to believe that what led to the acceptance of this
   part of the creed was less any anti-Apollinarian interest, or any
   definite theory as to the condition of the souls in the kingdom of the
   dead, than the endeavour to give as complete an account as possible of
   the history of Christ' s passion and his glory. The oldest interpreters
   make "descendit" equivalent to "sepultus." Nevertheless, even from the
   point of view of comparative criticism, both additions will, on account
   of their dubious meaning, be allowed to be failures. Even in modern
   times they are explained quite differently by different parties in the
   Church. [73]
