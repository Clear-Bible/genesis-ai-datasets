Prefatory note.

   John Goodwin, in reply to whom the following large treatise on the
   Doctrine of the Perseverance of the Saints was written, has been aptly
   described by Calamy as "a man by himself." An Arminian in creed, an
   Independent in church-government, and a Republican in politics, "he was
   against every man, and had almost every man against him." Estranged, by
   a singular idiosyncrasy of opinions, from all the leading parties of
   his time, dying in such obscurity that no record of the circumstances
   in which he left the world has been transmitted, stigmatized with
   unmerited reproach by the chief historian of his age, and long reputed
   the very type of extravagance and eccentricity in religion and
   politics, he has been more recently claimed as the precursor of a most
   influential religious body, and all honour rendered to him as the
   Wycliffe of Methodism, -- anticipating the theological views of its
   founder, Wesley, and redeeming them from the charge of novelty.
   Stronger expressions of respect and praise Goodwin never received from
   his contemporaries than are to be found in the pages of his antagonist,
   Owen, who, eulogizing his "worth," his "diligence," and his "great
   abilities," affirms that "nothing not great, not considerable, not in
   some way eminent, is by any spoken of him, either consenting with him
   or dissenting from him."

   He was born in Norfolk in 1593, was made a Fellow of Queen's College,
   Cambridge, in 1617, and in 1633, as the choice of the parishioners, was
   presented to the vicarage of St Stephen's, Coleman Street, London. He
   escaped the vengeance of Laud, for some "breach of the canons," by the
   premise of amendment and submission for the future. He published in a
   treatise on justification, entitled "Imputatio Fidei;" in which he
   maintains that faith, not the righteousness of Christ, "is that which
   God imputes to a believer for righteousness." Having rendered himself
   obnoxious to the Presbyterians during their brief supremacy, partly by
   his doctrinal sentiments, and partly by his literary efforts against
   them, he lost his vicarage by a decision of the Committee for Plundered
   Ministers, in 1645; but he appears to have been reinstated in it during
   the ascendency of Cromwell, whom he had effectually served by some
   pamphlets justifying the proceedings of the army against the Parliament
   in 1648: and more especially by a tract entitled "The Obstructors of
   Justice," in which he defended the High Court of Justice in passing
   sentence of death against Charles I. On the Restoration, by an order of
   the House of Commons, proceedings were instituted conjointly against
   John Milton and John Goodwin, for the same crime of publishing in
   vindication of the king's death. After a debate of several hours, it
   was agreed in Parliament that the life of Goodwin should be spared; but
   as he was declared incapable of holding any office, ecclesiastical,
   civil, or military, he was again deprived of his vicarage. His death
   took place in 1665. His private character seems to have been beyond
   reproach. The odium resting on his memory must be ascribed chiefly to
   his defence of the execution of Charles I., and to the statements of
   Bishop Burnet respecting his connection with the Fifth-monarchy Men. On
   the former point many good men privately held the same opinion as
   Goodwin; and some, such as Canne and Milton, published in defence of
   it. When Burnet accuses him of being "thorough-paced in temporal
   matters" for Cromwell, there might be a colour of truth in the charge:
   but when he speaks of Goodwin as "heading" the Fifth-monarchy Men,
   filling all men with the expectation of a millennium, "that it looked
   like a madness possessing them," and representing kingship as "the
   great antichrist that hindered Christ being set on his throne;" and
   when Toplady, improving upon the story, insinuates that Venner, the
   leader of these fanatics in their insurrection preached and held his
   meetings in Goodwin's place of worship, for no reason that we can
   discover but that Goodwin and Venner seem to have held their meetings
   in the same street, we are constrained to question both the accuracy of
   the statement as well as the spirit from which it emanated. His
   enemies, such as Prynne and Edwards, never in all they wrote against
   him urged such an accusation. In his own writings he affirms the
   lawfulness of civil magistracy, and of monarchy in particular; and in
   some of his tracts condemns the excesses of the Fifth-monarchy Men. The
   specific statements of Burnet, however, cannot well be met by a general
   charge against him as an inaccurate historian. Mr Macaulay has thrown
   over the bishop the shield of his high authority, denouncing such a
   charge as "altogether unjust." Goodwin may have held some millenarian
   views akin to the notion of a fifth monarchy, while he blames in severe
   terms the attempt to forestall and introduce it by violence and
   bloodshed. In one of the passages from his writings, quoted by
   Professor Jackson, in his able but somewhat impassioned biography of
   Goodwin, in order to disprove his connection with the Fifth-monarchy
   Men, there is a sentence which, discriminating the dogma itself from
   the excesses of its abettors, sustains our conjecture, and we have seen
   nothing in the other passages inconsistent with it:-- "Amongst the
   persons known by the name of the Fifth-monarchy Men (not so much from
   their opinion touching the said monarchy, as by that fierce and
   restless spirit which worketh in them to bring it into the world by
   unhallowed methods), you will learn to speak evil of those that are in
   dignity," etc. On this supposition, while committed to some
   premillennial notions, on which the representations of the bishop were
   founded, Goodwin might be altogether undeserving of the odious
   imputation which they affix upon his memory.

   It was no weak fanatic, therefore, against whom Owen in this instance
   entered the lists. His work, "Redemption Redeemed," is a monument of
   literary diligence and ability; and Owen seems almost to envy the
   copious and powerful diction which enlivens its controversial details.
   It was his intention to discuss all the points embraced in the
   Quinquarticular Controversy; but he overtook only two of them in the
   work now mentioned, -- universal redemption, and the perseverance of
   the saints. The latter topic, occupying about a third part of his work,
   naturally arose out of the former, when he sought to prove that Christ
   died for those who ultimately perish, even though for a season they may
   have been in a state of grace. Owen, in his reply, confines himself to
   the subject of the perseverance of the saints; first proving the
   doctrine by general arguments, and then considering its practical
   effects in the obedience and consolation of the saints, a minute
   refutation of Goodwin's views being interwoven with both parts of his
   work. On the subject of universal redemption our author had already
   given his views to the world in his treatise, "The Death of Death,"
   etc. Long as the following treatise is, however, he intimates his
   desire to enter still farther on some points in which he was at issue
   with Goodwin. Though the present work was written while he was burdened
   with heavy duties as Vice-Chancellor at Oxford, the former part of it
   is prepared with sufficient care, and relieved with some sprightliness
   in the composition. The leading fallacy of his opponent, in supposing
   that the perseverance of the saints implied the continuance of men in
   gracious privilege though they should become wicked to a degree
   incompatible with genuine faith, and evincing that they never possessed
   it, -- a fallacy which begs the whole question in dispute, -- he
   compares to "a sturdy beggar," which hath been "often corrected, and
   sent away grumbling and hungry, and, were it not for pure necessity,
   would never once be owned any more by its master." The latter part of
   the work, though able and dexterous in tracking all the sinuosities of
   the opposing arguments, betrays haste in composition, occasioning
   unusual difficulty in eliciting, by amended punctuation, the real
   meaning of many paragraphs and sentences; and the termination is
   singularly abrupt. He had reserved one of his principal arguments,
   founded on the oath of God, for the close, as entitled to the "honour
   of being the last word in the contest;" but concludes without giving it
   any place in the discussion at all. Perhaps this haste and abruptness
   are to be explained by the fact that before he had finished this work,
   the commands of the Council of State were laid upon him to undertake a
   reply to the Socinian productions of Biddle; -- a task which he
   executed at great length in his "Vindiciæ Evangelicæ." On the whole,
   however, in regard to the present work, there is no treatise in the
   language so conclusive and so complete in vindication of the doctrine
   which it is designed to illustrate and defend.

   In the preface a historical account is given of the doctrine from the
   earliest ages of the church. The confusion alleged to exist in it is
   not very perplexing, if attention be paid to the "catena patrum," --
   the succession of authors to whom he appeals in proof of what the view
   of the church has been in past ages on the subject of the doctrine
   under consideration. It is embarrassed, however, by a discussion of the
   authenticity of the Ignatian Epistles; on which, at the close of the
   preface, we have appended a note, indicating the present state of the
   controversy respecting them. The leading head-lines we have given to
   each chapter will enable the reader, it is hoped, to follow with
   greater ease the course of discussion. An exact copy of the original
   title-page has been prefixed; -- the only one in our author's works
   worth preserving, as curious in itself, and containing his own analysis
   of the work to which it belongs.

   Besides this work of Owen, in reply to Goodwin the following authors
   appeared:-- Dr George Kendall, rector of Blisland, near Bodmin in
   Cornwall, in two folio volumes, "Theocratia, or a Vindication of the
   Doctrine commonly received," etc., 1653, and "Sancti Sanciti," etc.;
   Thomas Lamb, a Baptist minister, in his "Absolute Freedom from Sin by
   Christ's Death," etc., 1656; Robert Baillie, Principal of Glasgow
   University, in his "Scotch Antidote against the English Infection of
   Arminianism," etc., 1656; Richard Resbury, vicar of Oundle, in his
   "Some Stop to the Gangrene of Arminianism," etc., 1651, whom Goodwin
   answered in his "Confidence Dismounted," and who again published in
   reply, "The Lightless Star;" Henry Jeanes, rector of Chedsey, who
   published "A Vindication of Dr Twisse from the Exceptions of Mr John
   Goodwin;" and Mr John Pawson, in a sermon under the title of "A
   Vindication of Free Grace."

   In 1658 Goodwin replied to most of these publications in a quarto of
   five hundred pages, entitled "Triumviri," etc. In regard to the
   following treatise, "he returns," says Owen, in an epistle dedicatory
   to his work on the Divine Original of the Scriptures, "a scoffing reply
   to so much of it as was written in a quarter of an hour."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Analysis.

   After a careful definition of the terms employed in the controversy,
   the statement by Mr Goodwin of the question at issue is objected to,
   and another proposed as more correct, founded upon a passage in
   Scripture, Isa. iv. 5. Chap. i.

   Five leading arguments are adduced in proof of the perseverance of the
   saints:-- It is argued, 1. From the divine nature as immutable; under
   which head the following passages are considered, Mal. iii. 6; James i.
   16-18; Rom. xi. 29; Isa. xl. 27-31, xliv. 1-8. 2. From the divine
   purpose as immutable; and here Scripture is first cited to prove the
   general immutability of the divine purposes, Isa. xlvi. 9-11; Ps.
   xxxiii. 9-11, etc.; -- and then the special purpose of God to continue
   his grace to true believers is proved by such passages as Rom. viii.
   28; Jer. xxxi. 3; John vi. 37-40; Matt. xxiv. 24; Eph. i. 3-5; 2 Thess.
   ii. 13, 14. 3. From the covenant of grace, the enduring character and
   the infallible accomplishment of which are proved by the removal of all
   causes of change by it, the stipulations of Christ as mediator in it,
   and the faithfulness of God. 4. From the promises of God, which are
   generally described, and, as intimating the perseverance of the saints,
   proved to be unconditional, the following promises to this effect
   receiving full elucidation: Josh. i. 5; Heb. xiii. 5; 1 Sam. xii. 22;
   Ps. lxxxix. 30-37; Hos. ii. 19, 20; John x. 27-29. At this point the
   consideration of the oath of God is deferred, under promise of entering
   upon it at the close of the discussion; -- a promise which the author
   omits to fulfil. Two interesting digressions follow, affording separate
   arguments in support of the doctrine; -- on the mediation of Christ, as
   comprehending his oblation and intercession, and on the indwelling of
   the Spirit. And here the first part of the work concludes. Chap.
   ii.-ix.

   The second part consists in the improvement of the doctrine, by showing
   how it conduces to the obedience and consolation of the saints, chap.
   x., and in a refutation of the following arguments of Mr Goodwin in
   support of the opposite doctrine, -- namely, 1. That it is more
   effectual in promoting godliness; 2. That it does not make God an
   accepter of persons; 3. That it has been the doctrine of the most pious
   men in all ages; 4. That it imparts greater power to the exhortations
   of the gospel; 5. That upon such a principle alone eternal life can be
   legitimately promised as the reward of perseverance; 6. That it is
   proved by the sins into which believers undoubtedly fall; 7. That it
   tends to the consolation of the saints; and, lastly, That it is
   affirmed in eight passages of Scripture, Ezek. xviii. 24, 25; Matt.
   xviii. 32-35; 1 Cor. ix. 27; Heb. vi. 4-8, x. 26-29, 38, 39; Matt.
   xiii. 20, 21; 2 Pet. ii. 18-22. Chap. xi.-xvii. -- Ed.

To his highness Oliver, Lord-Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, with the dominions thereof.

   Sir,

   The wise man tells us that "no man knoweth love or hatred by all that
   is before him." The great variety wherein God dispenseth outward things
   in the world, with the many changes and alterations which, according to
   the counsel of his will, he continually works in the dispensations of
   them, will not allow them nakedly in themselves to be evidences of the
   Fountain from whence they flow. Seeing, also, that the want or
   abundance of them may equally, by the goodness and wisdom of God, be
   ordered and cast into a useful subserviency to a good infinitely
   transcending what is or may be contained in them, there is no necessity
   that in the distribution of them God should walk according to any
   constant uniform law of procedure, all the various alterations about
   them answering one eternal purpose for a determinate end. Of spiritual
   good things there is another reason and condition; for as they are in
   themselves fruits, evidences, and pledges, of an eternal, unchangeable
   love, so the want of them in their whole kind being not capable of a
   tendency to a greater good than they are, the dispensation of them doth
   so far answer the eternal Spring and Fountain from whence it floweth
   as, in respect of its substance and being, not to be obnoxious to any
   alteration. This is that which in the ensuing treatise is contended
   for. In the midst of all the changes and mutations which the infinitely
   wise providence of God doth daily effect in the greater and lesser
   things of this world, as to the communication of his love in Jesus
   Christ, and the merciful, gracious distributions of the unsearchable
   riches of grace, and the hid treasures thereof purchased by his blood,
   he knows no repentance. Of both these you have had full experience; and
   though your concernment in the former hath been as eminent as that of
   any person whatever in these later ages of the world, yet your interest
   in and acquaintance with the latter is, as of incomparable more
   importance in itself, so answerably of more value and esteem unto you.
   A sense of the excellency and sweetness of unchangeable love, emptying
   itself in the golden oil of distinguishing spiritual mercies, is one
   letter of that new name which none can read but he that hath it. The
   series and chain of eminent providences whereby you have been carried
   on and protected in all the hazardous work of your generation, which
   your God hath called you unto, is evident to all. Of your preservation
   by the power of God, through faith, in a course of gospel obedience,
   upon the account of the immutability of the love and infallibility of
   the promises of God, which are yea and amen in Jesus Christ, your own
   soul only is possessed with the experience. Therein is that abiding
   joy, that secret refreshment, which the world cannot give. That you and
   all the saints of God may yet enjoy that peace and consolation which is
   in believing that the eternal love of God is immutable, that he is
   faithful in his promises, that his covenant, ratified in the death of
   his Son, is unchangeable, that the fruits of the purchase of Christ
   shall be certainly bestowed on all them for whom he died, and that
   every one who is really interested in these things shall be kept unto
   salvation, is the aim of my present plea and contest. That I have taken
   upon me to present my weak endeavours in this cause of God to your
   Highness is so far forth from my persuasion of your interest in the
   truth contended for (and than which you have none more excellent or
   worthy), that without it no other considerations whatever, either of
   that dignity and power whereunto of God you are called, or of your
   peculiar regard to that society of men whereof I am an unworthy member,
   or any other personal respects whatever, could have prevailed with or
   emboldened me thereunto. "Sancta sanctis." The things I treat of are
   such as sometimes "none of the princes of this world knew," and as yet
   few of them are acquainted with. Blessed are they who have their
   portion in them! When the urgency of your high and important affairs,
   wherein so many nations are concerned, will lend you so much leisure as
   to take a view of what is here tendered, the knowledge which you have
   of me will deliver you from a temptation of charging any weakness you
   may meet withal upon the doctrine which I assert and maintain; and so
   that may "run and be glorified," whatever become of the nothing that I
   have done in the defence thereof, I shall be abundantly satisfied. That
   is the shield, which being safe, I can with contentment see these
   papers die. Unto your Highness I have not any thing more to add, nor
   for you greater thing to pray, than that you may be established in the
   assurance and sense of that unchangeable love and free acceptance in
   Christ which I contend for, and that therein you may be preserved, to
   the glory of God, the advancement of the gospel, and the real advantage
   of these nations.

   Your Highness's most humble and most faithful servant,

   John Owen.
     __________________________________________________________________

To the right worshipful, his reverend, learned and worthy friends and brethren,
the heads and governors of the colleges and halls in the University of Oxford.

   Sirs,

   The dedication of books to the names of men worthy and of esteem in
   their generation takes sanctuary in so catholic and ancient
   prescription, that to use any defensative about my walking in the same
   path cannot but forfeit the loss of somewhat more than the pains that
   would he spent therein. Now, although, in addresses of this kind, men
   usually avail themselves of the occasion to deliver their thoughts as
   to particulars in great variety, according as their concernments may
   he, yet the reasons which are generally pleaded as directions for the
   choice of them to whom, with their labours and writings, they so
   address themselves, are for the most part uniform, and in their various
   course transgress not the rules of certain heads from whence they flow.
   To express a gratitude for respects and favours received, by returning
   things in their kind eternal for those which are but temporal; to
   obtain countenance and approbation unto their endeavours, in their
   breaking forth into the world, from names of more esteem, or at least
   more known than their own; to advance in repute by a correspondency in
   judgment with men of such esteem, intimated thereby, -- are the more
   ingenuous aims of men in the dedications of their writings. Though
   these, and sundry other pretences of the same kind, might justly be
   drawn into my plea for this address unto you, yet your peculiar
   designation and appointment, through the good hand of the providence of
   God, to the defence of the gospel, and your eminent furnishment with
   abilities from the same hand for the performance of that glorious duty,
   is that alone upon the account whereof I have satisfied myself, and
   hope that I may not dissatisfy others, as to this present application.
   What there is of my own peculiar concernment, wherein I am like to
   obtain a more favourable condescension in judgment, as to my present
   undertaking, from you than from other men, will in the close of my
   address crave leave to have mention made thereof. Brethren! the outward
   obligations that are upon you from the God of truth, with the
   advantages which he hath intrusted you withal for the defence of his
   truth, above the most of men in the world, are evident even to them
   that walk by the way, and turn little aside to the consideration of
   things of this nature, importance, and condition; and it is to me an
   evidence of no small encouragement that God will yet graciously employ
   you in the work and labour of his gospel, by his constant giving a
   miscarrying womb to all them who have attempted to defraud the nation
   and the churches of God therein of those helps and furtherances of
   piety and literature with whose management for their service you are at
   present intrusted. Of the jewels of silver and gold whereof, by the
   Lord's appointment, the children of Israel, coming out from amongst
   them, spoiled the Egyptians, did they dedicate to the tabernacle in the
   wilderness, when the Lord "planted the heavens, and laid the
   foundations of the earth, and said unto Zion, Thou art my people."
   Though some outward provisions and furnitures of literature, -- now,
   through the good hand of God, made serviceable to you in your
   attendance upon the great work and employment committed to you, -- were
   first deposited when thick darkness was over the land, yet that they
   may be made eminently subservient to the will of God in raising up
   again the tabernacle of David, that was fallen down, the experience of
   a few years, I no way doubt, will abundantly reveal and manifest. That
   in the vicissitude of all things, given them by the mysterious and
   dreadful wheels of providence, your good things also (as every thing
   else that is pleasant and desirable, or given of God unto the sons of
   men, hath done) have fallen into the possession and disposal of men,
   some enemies, others utterly useless and unfruitful to the Lord in
   their generations, cannot be denied; but what is there, in his ways or
   worship, in his works or word, that God hath not, at some season or
   other, delivered into the power of the men of the world; though they
   have abused and perverted them to their own destruction? Neither is
   there any other use of this consideration, but only to inform them of
   the obligation they lie under to a due and zealous improvement of them
   to whose trust and care the Lord commits any of his mercies, when he
   rescues them from the captivity under which they have been detained by
   ungodly men. This is now your lot and condition in reference to many
   who, for sundry generations, possessed those places and advantages of
   eminent service for the house of our God which you now enjoy. What may
   justly be the expectation of God from you, under this signal
   dispensation of his goodness; what is the hope, prayer, and expectation
   of very many that fear him, concerning you in this nation; what are the
   designs, desires, aims, and endeavours, of all sorts of them who bear
   ill-will at whatsoever is comely or praiseworthy amongst us, -- you are
   not ignorant. Whatever consideration, at any time or season, may seem
   to have had an efficacy upon the minds and wills of men under the like
   sacrament and designment to the service of truth with yourselves, to
   incite and provoke them to a singularly industrious and faithful
   discharge of their duty, is eminently pressing upon you also; and you
   are made a spectacle to men and angels as to the acquitment of
   yourselves. The whole of your employment, I confess, -- both in the
   general intendment of it, for the promoting and diffusing of light,
   knowledge, and truth, in every kind whatever, and in the more special
   design thereof, for the defence, furtherance, and propagation of the
   ancient, inviolable, unchangeable truth of the gospel of God, -- is, in
   the days wherein we live, exposed to a contention with as much
   opposition, contempt, scorn, hatred, and reproach, as ever any such
   undertaking was, in any place in the world wherein men pretended to
   love light more than darkness.

   It is a hellish darkness which the light of the sun cannot expel. There
   is no ignorance so full of pride, folly, and stubbornness, as that
   which maintains itself in the midst of plentiful means of light and
   knowledge. He that is in the dark when the light of the sun is as seven
   days, hath darkness in his eye; and how great is that darkness! Such is
   the ignorance you have to contend withal; stubborn, affected,
   prejudicate, beyond expression; maintaining its darkness at noonday;
   expressly refusing to attend to the reason of things, as being that
   alone, in the thoughts of those men (if they may be so called who are
   possessed with it), wherewith the world is disturbed. From those who,
   being under the power of this inthralment, do seem to repine at God
   that they are not beasts, and clamorously traduce the more noble part
   of that kind and offspring whereof themselves are, -- which attempts do
   heighten and improve the difference between creatures of an
   intellectual race and them, to whom their perishing composition gives
   the utmost advancement, -- whose eternal seeds and principles are laid
   by the hand of God in their respective beings, you will not, I am sure,
   think it much if you meet with oppositions. Those who are in any
   measure acquainted with the secret triumphing exaltations of wisdom and
   knowledge against folly and ignorance, with the principles and
   conditions wherewith they advance themselves in their gloryings, even
   then when the precedency of (that which is bestial in this world) force
   and violence outwardly bears them down with insultation and contempt,
   will rather envy than pity you in any contest that on this foot of
   account you can be engaged in. You are not the first that have fought
   with men after the manner of beasts, nor will be the last who shall
   need to pray to be delivered from absurd and unreasonable men, seeing
   "all men have not faith."

   Men of profane and atheistical spirits, who are ready to say, "Who is
   the Lord? What is the Almighty that we should fear him? or his truth
   that we should regard it?" whose generation is of late multiplied on
   the face of the earth, crying "A confederacy" with them who, professing
   better things, are yet filled with grievous indignation at the
   sacrifice that hath been made of their abominations before their eyes,
   by that reformation of this place wherein you have been instrumental,
   are a continual goad on the other side, and would quickly be a sword in
   your very bowels, were not "He that is higher than the highest" your
   dwelling-place and refuge in your generation. These are they upon whom
   God having poured contempt and stained their glory, they, instead of
   accepting of his dispensations, are filled with wrath, and labour to
   make others drink of the cup which hath been offered to themselves.
   With their reproaches, slightings, undervaluations, slanders, do your
   worth, diligence, integrity, labours, contend from one end of this
   earth to the other. He that "hath delivered doth deliver; and in him we
   trust that he will yet deliver."

   What other oppositions you do meet, or in your progress may meet
   withal, I shall not mention; but wait with patience on Him who gives
   men repentance and change of heart to the acknowledgment of the things
   that are of Him. This in the midst of all hath hitherto been a cause of
   great rejoicing, that God hath graciously kept off ravenous wolves from
   entering into your flocks, where are so many tender lambs, and hath not
   suffered "men to arise from amongst yourselves speaking perverse
   things, and drawing away disciples after them;" but as he hath given
   you to "obey from the heart that form of doctrine which hath been
   delivered unto you," so he hath preserved that "faith" amongst you
   "which was once delivered unto the saints."

   Your peculiar designation to the service of the gospel and defence of
   the truth thereof, your abilities for that work, your abiding in it
   notwithstanding the opposition you meet withal, "in the midst of a
   crooked and perverse generation," are, as I said before, my
   encouragements in this address unto you, wherein I shall crave leave a
   little farther to communicate my thoughts unto you as to the matter in
   hand. Next to the Son of his love, who is the Truth, the greatest and
   most eminent gift that God hath bestowed on the sons of men, and
   communicated to them, is his truth revealed in his word, -- the
   knowledge of him, his mind and will, according to the discovery which
   he hath made of himself from his own bosom, having magnified his word
   above all his name. The importance hereof as to the eternal
   concernments of the sons of men, either in ignorance refusing and
   resisting, or accepting and embracing of it, is that which is owned,
   and lies at the bottom and foundation of all that we any way engage
   ourselves into in this world, wherein we differ from them whose hope
   perisheth with them. Unto an inquiry after and entertainment of this
   divine and sacred depositum hath God designed the fruit and labour of
   that wherein we retain the resemblance of him; which, whilst we have
   our being, nothing can abolish. The mind of man and divine truth are
   the two most eminent excellencies wherewith the Lord hath adorned this
   lower part of his creation; which, when they correspond and are brought
   into conformity with each other, the mind being changed into the image
   of truth, there is glory added to glory, and the whole rendered
   exceeding glorious. By what suitableness and proportion in the things
   themselves (that is, between truth and the mind of man), as we are men,
   -- by what almighty, secret, and irresistible power, as we are
   corrupted men, our minds being full of darkness and folly, -- this is
   wrought, is not my business now to discuss. This is on all hands
   confessed, that, setting aside the consideration of the eternal issues
   of things, every mistake of divine truth, every opposition to it or
   rejection of it, or any part of it, is so far a chaining up of the mind
   under the power of darkness from a progress towards that perfection
   which it is capable of. It is truth alone that capacitates any soul to
   give glory to God, or to be truly useful to them who are partakers of
   flesh and blood with him; without being some way serviceable to which
   end, there is nothing short of the fullness of wrath that can be judged
   so miserable as the life of a man. Easily so much might be delivered on
   this account as to evince the dread of that judgment whereto some men,
   in the infallibly wise counsel of God, are doomed, even to the laying
   out of the labour and travail of their minds, to spend their days and
   strength in sore labour, in making opposition to this truth of God.
   Especially is the sadness of this consideration increased in reference
   to them who, upon any account whatever, do bear forth themselves, and
   are looked upon by others, as "guides of the blind," as "lights to them
   which are in darkness," as the "instructors of the foolish," and
   "teachers of babes." For a man to set himself, or to be set by others,
   in a way wherein are many turnings and cross paths, some of them
   leading and tending to places of innumerable troubles, and perhaps
   death and slaughter, undertaking to be a guide to direct them that
   travel towards the place of their intendments, where they would be, and
   where they shall meet with rest; for such an one, I say, to take hold
   of every one that passeth by, pretending himself to be exceeding
   skilful in all the windings and turnings of those ways and paths, and
   to stand there on purpose to give direction, if he shall, with all his
   skill and rhetoric, divert them out of the path wherein they have
   perhaps safely set out, and so guide them into those by-ways which will
   certainly lead them into snares and troubles, if not to death itself,
   -- can he spend his time, labour, and strength, in an employment more
   to be abhorred? or can he design any thing more desperately mischievous
   to them whose good and welfare he is bound and promiseth to seek and
   promote? Is any man's condition under heaven more to be lamented, or is
   any man's employment more perilous, than such an one's, who, being not
   only endowed with a mind and understanding capable of the truth and
   receiving impressions of the will of God, but also with distinguishing
   abilities and enlargements for the receiving of greater measures of
   truth than others, and for the more effectual improvement of what he
   doth so receive, shall labour night and day, dispending the richest
   treasure and furnishment of his soul for the rooting out, defacing, and
   destruction of the truth, for the turning men out of the way and paths
   that lead to rest and peace? I never think of the uncomfortable
   drudgery which men give up themselves unto, in laying the hay and
   stubble of their vain and false conceptions upon the foundation, and
   heaping up the fruit of their souls, to make the fire that consumes
   them the more fierce and severe, but it forces compassionate thoughts
   of that sad condition whereto mankind hath cast itself by its apostasy
   from God. And yet there is not any thing in the world that men more
   willingly, with more delight and greediness, consecrate the flower of
   their strength and abilities unto, than this of promoting the delusions
   of their own minds, in opposition to the truth and ways of God. It is a
   thing of obvious observation and daily experience, that if, by any
   means whatever, any one closeth with some new and by-opinion, off from
   the faith delivered to and received by the generality of the saints, be
   it a thing of never so small concernment in our walking with God in
   gospel obedience, and in love without dissimulation one towards
   another, yet instantly more weight is laid upon it, more pains laid out
   about it, and zeal dispended for its supportment and propagation, than
   about all other most necessary points of Christian religion. Have we
   not a deplorable cloud of examples of men contending about some
   circumstance or other in the administration of an ordinance, biting and
   devouring all that stand in their way, roving up and down to gain
   proselytes unto their persuasion, and in the meantime utterly ignorant
   or negligent of the great doctrines and commands of the gospel of Jesus
   Christ, which are, as in him, the head and life of souls? How many a
   man seems to have no manner of religion at all, but some one error!
   That is his God, his Christ, his worship; that he preaches, that he
   discourseth of, that he labours to propagate, until, by the righteous
   judgment of God, it comes to pass that such men in all other things
   wither and die away, all the sap and vigour of their spirits feeding
   that one monstrous excrescency, which they grow up daily into. Desire
   of emerging and being notable in the world, esteem and respect in the
   hearts and mouths of them whom peculiarly they draw after them, with
   the like unworthy aims of self-advancement, may, without evil surmising
   (when such attempts are, as in too many, accompanied with irregularity
   in conversation), be supposed to be advantages given into the hands of
   the envious man, to make use of them for the sowing of his tares in the
   field of the poor seduced world.

   That this procedure is also furthered by the burdensomeness of sound
   doctrine unto the generality of men, who, having "itching ears," as far
   as they care for these things, do spend their time in religion in
   nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing, cannot be
   denied. Besides, to defend, improve, give and add new light unto, old
   truths (a work which hath so abundantly and excellently been laboured
   in by so many worthies of Christ, especially since the Reformation), in
   any eminent manner, so as to bring praise and repute unto the
   undertakers (which, whether men will confess or no, it is evident that
   too many are enslaved unto), is no easy task. And for the most part of
   what is done that way, you may say, "Quis leget hæc?" The world, says
   every one, is burdened with discourses of this nature. How many have we
   in our days who might have gone to the grave in silence among the
   residue of their brethren, and their names have remained for a season
   in the voisinage, where they might have done God the service required
   of them in their generation, would they have kept themselves in the
   form of wholesome words and sound doctrine, that have now delivered
   their names into the mouths of all men, by engaging into some singular
   opinions, though perhaps raked out of the ashes of Popery, Socinianism,
   or some such fruitful heap of error and false notions of the things of
   God!

   I desire not to judge before the time; the day will manifest all
   things, and the hidden secrets of the hearts of men shall by it be laid
   open, when all the ways, causes, and occasions, of their deceiving and
   being deceived shall be brought to light, and every man according to
   his work shall have praise of God; -- only, I say, as to the present
   state of things, this is evident (not to speak of those locusts from
   the bottomless pit that professedly oppose their strength to all that
   is of God, his name, word, worship, truth, will, and commands, razing
   the foundation of all hopes for eternity; nor of him and his associates
   who "exalteth himself above all that is called God," being "full of
   names of blasphemy," sealed up to destruction), very many amongst
   ourselves, of whom we hoped better things, do, some in greater, some in
   lesser matters, give up themselves to that unhappy labour we before
   mentioned, of opposing the truth of God, and exalting their own
   darkness in the room of his glorious light.


   "Ut jugulent homines, surgunt de nocte latrones:

   Ut teipsum serves, non expergisceres?" [1]

   Reverend brethren, if other men can rise early, go to bed late, and eat
   the bread of carefulness, spend their lives and strength to do their
   own work, and propagate their own conceptions, under a pretence of
   doing the work of God; if the envious man watcheth all night and waits
   all advantages to sow his tares, -- how will you be able to lift up
   your heads with joy, and behold your Master's face with boldness at his
   coming, if, having received such eminent abilities, endowments, and
   furnishments from him for his service, and the service of his sheep and
   lambs, as you have done, you gird not up the loins of your minds, and
   lay not out your strength to the uttermost for the weeding out of the
   field and vineyard of the Lord "every plant which our heavenly Father
   hath not planted," and for feeding the flock of Christ with sincere
   milk and strong meat, according as they are able to bear? What you have
   received more than others is of free grace which is God's way of
   dealing with them on whom he lays the most unconquerable and
   indispensable obligations unto service. Flesh and blood hath not
   revealed, unto you the truth of God which you do profess, but our
   Father which is in heaven. You do not upon any endeavour of your own
   differ from them who are given up to the sore judgment and
   ever-to-be-bewailed condition before mentioned. It hath not been from
   your own endeavours or watchfulness that you have been hitherto
   preserved under the hour of temptation, which is come to try the men
   that live upon the face of the earth. It is not of yourselves that you
   are not industriously disturbing your own souls and others with this or
   that intrenchment upon the doctrine of the gospel, and the free grace
   of God in Jesus Christ; which not a few pride themselves in, with the
   contempt of all otherwise minded. And doth not the present state of
   things require the full disbursing of all that you have freely received
   for the glory of Him from whom you have received it? You are not only
   persons who, as doctors and teachers in a university, have a large,
   distinct disciplinary knowledge of divinity, but also such as to whom
   "the Son of God is come, and hath given an understanding to know him
   that is true;" "into whose hearts God hath shined, to give the light of
   the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jesus Christ;" and therefore
   may say, "?What shall we render to the Lord?' how shall we serve him in
   any way answerable to the grace we have received?" I speak not this,
   the Lord knows it, before whom I stand, with reflection on any, as
   though I judged them neglecters of the duty incumbent on them. "Every
   one of us must give account of himself to God." The daily pains,
   labour, and travail, of many of you in the work of the gospel, the
   diligence and endeavours of others in promoting other useful
   literature, are known unto all. Only the consideration of my own
   present undertaking, joined with a sense of mine own insufficiency for
   this, or any other labour of this kind, and of your larger furnishment
   with abilities of all sorts, press me to this stirring up of your
   remembrance to contend for the faith, so much opposed and perverted.
   Not that I would press for the needless multiplying of books (whose
   plenty is the general customary complaint of all men versed in them),
   unless necessity call thereto. "Scribimus indocti, doctique." But that
   serious thoughts may be continually dwelling in you to lay out
   yourselves to obviate the spreading of any error whatever, or for the
   destruction of any already propagated, by such ways and means as the
   providence of God and the circumstances of the matter itself shall call
   you out unto, is in the desire of my soul.

   Something you will find in this kind attempted by the weakest of your
   number, in this ensuing treatise. The matter of it I know will have
   your approbation, and that because it hath His whom you serve. For the
   manner of handling it, it is humbly given up to his grace and mercy,
   and freely left to your Christian judgment. The general concernments of
   this business are so known to all that I shall by no means burden you
   with a repetition of them. The attempt made by Mr Goodwin against the
   truth here asserted was by all men judged so considerable (especially
   the truth opposed having a more practical influence into the walking of
   the saints with God than any other by him assaulted, and the defending
   of it giving more advantage unto an inquiry after the mind of God, as
   delivered in innumerable places of Scripture, than any of the rest
   opposed) as that a removal of his exceptions to our arguments, and an
   answer to his objections, were judged necessary by all. Other reasons
   manifesting this endeavour to be in order and in season, I have farther
   communicated in the entrance of the treatise itself. In my addresses to
   the work, I could by no means content myself with a mere discussing of
   what was produced by my adversary; for he having kept himself, for the
   most part, within the compass of the synodal writings of the
   Remonstrants, which are already most clearly and solidly answered (by
   one especially, renowned Amesius), to have tied myself unto a contest
   with him had been merely actum agere, without promoting the cause I had
   undertaken in the least. As I account it by no means an ingenuous
   proceeding for men to bear up their own names by standing upon the
   shoulders of others, to deport themselves authors when indeed they are
   but collectors and translators; so I am very remote from being so far
   in love with this way of handling controversies in divinity, as to
   think it necessary to multiply books of the same matter, without some
   considerable addition of light and strength to the cause whose
   protection and promotion are undertaken. On this consideration, besides
   incident discourses, which I hope, through the grace of Him that
   supplied seed to the sower, may be of use and have an increase amongst
   the saints of God, I have made it my aim (and what therein I have
   attained is, with all submission of mind and judgment, cast before the
   thoughts of men whose senses are exercised to discern good and evil) to
   place each argument insisted on upon its own proper basis and
   foundation; to resolve every reason and medium whereby I have proceeded
   into its own principles, discovering the fountain and well-head of all
   the streams that run in the field of this contest; as also to give some
   clearings and evidences to our conclusions from the several texts of
   Scripture discussed, by discovering the reason of them and intent of
   God in them. Some arguments there are, and sundry texts of Scripture,
   that are usually produced and urged in the defence of the cause under
   consideration that I have not insisted on, nor vindicated from the
   exceptions of the adversaries. Not that I judge them indefensible
   against their most cunning or most furious assaults, and so slighted
   what I could not hold, -- for, indeed, I know not any one text of
   Scripture commonly used for this end, nor any argument by any sober man
   framed to the same purpose, that is not capable of an easy and fair
   vindication, -- but merely because they fell not in regularly in the
   method I had proposed to myself, nor would so do, unless I had gone
   forth to the issue of my first intendment, and had handled the abode of
   believers with God at large from its principles and causes, as I had
   done that part of our doctrine which concerns the continuance of the
   love of God with and unto them; which the growth of the treatise under
   my hand would not give me leave to do. What hath been, or may yet
   farther be, done by others who have made or shall make it their
   business to draw the saw of this controversy to and fro with Mr
   Goodwin, I hope will give satisfaction, as in other things, so in the
   particulars by me omitted. As to what I have to speak, or at least
   think it convenient to speak, concerning him with whom in this
   discourse I have much to do, and the manner of my dealing with him,
   being a thing of personal concernment, not having any influencing
   aspect on the merits of the cause, I shall in not many words absolve
   you of your trouble in the consideration thereof. My adversary is a
   person whom his worth, pains, diligence, and opinions, and the contests
   wherein on their account he hath publicly engaged, have delivered from
   being the object of any ordinary thoughts or expressions. Nothing not
   great, not considerable, not some way eminent, is by any spoken of him,
   either consenting with him or dissenting from him. To interpose my
   judgment in the crowd, on the one side or the other, I know neither
   warrant nor sufficient cause; we all stand or fall to our own masters,
   and the fire will try all our works. This only I shall crave liberty to
   say, that whether from his own genius and acrimony of spirit, or from
   the provocations of others with whom he hath had to do, many of his
   polemical treatises have been sprinkled with satirical sarcasms, and
   contemptuous rebukes of the persons with whom he hath had to do; so
   that were I not relieved in my thoughts by the consideration of those
   exacerbations and exasperations of spirit which, upon other accounts
   besides bare difference of opinion in religious things, have fallen out
   in the days and seasons which have passed over us, all of them
   labouring to exert something of themselves on every undertaking of the
   persons brought under their power, I should have been utterly
   discouraged from any contest of this nature. Much, indeed, of his
   irregularity in this kind I cannot but ascribe to that prompt facility
   he hath in putting abroad every passion of his mind and all his
   conceptions, not only decently clothed, with language of a full and
   choice significancy, but also trimmed and adorned with all manner of
   signal improvements that may render it keen or pleasant, according to
   his intendment or desire. What the Latin lyric said of the Grecian
   poets may be applied to him:--


   "Monte decurrens velut amnis, imbres

   Quem super notas aluêre ripas,

   Fervet, immensusque ruit profundo

   Pindarus ore." [2]

   And he is hereby plainly possessed of not a few advantages. It is true
   that when the proof of his opinion by argument, and the orderly pursuit
   of it, is incumbent on him (a course of all others wherein he soonest
   faileth), the medium he useth and insisteth on receiveth not the least
   contribution of real strength from any dress of words and expressions
   wherewith it is adorned and accompanied; yet it cannot be denied but
   that his allegorical amplifications, illustrations, and exaggerations
   of the things he would insinuate, take great impressions upon the minds
   of them who are in any measure entangled with the seeming probabilities
   which are painted over his arguments, by their sophistry and pretence
   of truth. The apostle, giving that caution to the Colossians, that they
   should take heed me tis autous paralogizetai en pithanologia,
   manifesteth the prevalency of false reasonings when in conjunction with
   rhetorical persuasion, Col. ii. 4. The great store also of words and
   expressions, which for all occasions he hath lying by him, are of no
   little use to him, when, being pressed with any arguments or
   testimonies of Scripture, and being not able to evade, he is forced to
   raise a cloud of them, wherewith after he hath a while darkened the
   wisdom and counsel of that wherewith he hath to do, he insensibly slips
   out of the cord wherewith he appeared to have been detained, and
   triumphs as in a perfect conquest, when only an unarticulate sound hath
   been given by his trumpet, but the charge of his adversaries not once
   received or repelled. But not anywhere doth he more industriously hoist
   up and spread the sails of his luxuriant eloquence than when he aims to
   render the opinion of his adversaries to be "monstrum horrendum,
   informe ingens, cui lumen ademptum," -- a dark, dismal, uncomfortable,
   fruitless, death-procuring doctrine, such as it is marvellous that ever
   any poor soul should embrace or choose for a companion or guide in its
   pilgrimage towards heaven. Rolling through this field, his expressions
   swell over all bounds and limits; metaphors, similitudes, parables, all
   help on the current, though the streams of it being shallow and wide, a
   little opposition easily turns it for the most part aside; a noise it
   makes, indeed, with a goodly show and appearance.


   "? Agylleus

   Herculeâ non mole minor, ?

   Sed non ille rigor, patriumque in corpore robur.

   Luxuriant artus, effusaque sanguine laxo

   Membra natant."

   [Stat. Theb., vi. 837-842, slightly altered.]

   This, as I said, prompts, I fear, the learned person of whom we speak
   to deal so harshly with some of them with whom he hath to do. And it is
   still feared that


   "Parata tollit cornua;

   Qualis Lycambæ spretus infido gener,

   Aut acer hostis Bupalo." [3]

   It might, indeed, be the more excusable if evident provocation were
   always ready at hand to be charged with the blame of this procedure, if
   he said only,


   "An, si quis atro dente me petiverit

   Inultus ut flebo puer." [4]

   But for a man to warm himself by casting about his own pen until it be
   so filled with indignation and scorn as to blur every page and almost
   every line, is a course that will never promote the praise nor adorn
   the truth of God. For what remains concerning him, "Do illi ingenium,
   do eloquentiam et industriam; fidem et veritatem utinam coluisset."

   The course and condition of my procedure with him, whether it be such
   as becometh Christian modesty and sobriety, with an allowance of those
   ingredients of zeal in contending for the truth which in such cases the
   Holy Ghost gives a command for, is referred to the judgment of all who
   are concerned, and account themselves so, in the things of God. As to
   any bitterness of expression, personal reflections, by application of
   satirical invectives, I know nothing by myself; and yet I dare not
   account that I am hereby justified. The calm and indifferent reader,
   not sensible of those commotions which the discovery of sophistical
   evasions, pressing of inconsequent consequences, bold assertions, etc.,
   will sometimes raise in the most candid and ingenuous mind, may (and
   especially if he be an observer of failings in that kind) espy once and
   again some signs and appearances of such exasperations as ought to have
   been allayed with a spirit of meekness before the thoughts that stirred
   them up had been turned out of doors in the expressions observed.
   Although I am not conscious of the delivery of myself in any terms
   intimating a captivity under the power of such a snare for a moment,
   yet what shall to the Christian reader occur of such a seeming tendency
   I humbly refer it to his judgment, being content to suffer loss in any
   hay or stubble whatever that I may have laid upon the foundation of
   truth, which I am sure is firmly fixed by God himself in the business
   in hand.

   For what farther concerns my manner of dealing in this argument, I have
   only a few things to mention, reverend brethren, and you will be
   discharged of the trouble of this prefatory address unto you. The
   matter in hand, I hope, you will find attended and pursued without
   either jocular or historical diversions, which are judged meet by some
   to retain the spirits and entice the minds of the readers, which are
   apt to faint and grow weary if always bent to the consideration of
   things weighty and serious. With you, who are continually exercised
   with severer thoughts and studies than the most of men can immix
   themselves withal, such a condescension to the vanity of men's minds
   and lightness of their spirits I am sure can find no approbation. And
   as for them who make it their business to run through books of a
   polemical nature, in what subject soever, in pursuit of what is
   personal, ridiculous, invective, beating every chapter and section to
   find only what ought not to be there, and recoiling in their spirits
   upon the appearance of that which is serious and pressing to the cause
   in hand, I suppose you judge them not worthy to be attended to with
   such an imposition upon the time and diligence of those who sincerely
   seek the truth in love as the satisfying of their vain humour would
   require. It is, indeed, of sad consideration to see how some learned
   men (forgetting the loss of precious hours wherewith they punish their
   readers thereby), in discourses of this nature, do offend against their
   professed intendments, by perpetual diversions, in long personal
   harangues, delighting some for a moment, instructing none in the matter
   inquired into. Some parts of this treatise you may perhaps judge not so
   closely and scholastically argumentative as the regular laws of an
   accurate disputation would require. In the same judgment with you is
   the author, when yet he supposes himself not without just apology, and
   that such as renders his way of procedure not blameworthy; whereas,
   otherwise, he, should not think any excuse sufficient to expiate such
   an error. He is worthily blamed who had not rather choose to want a
   fault than an excuse. The truth is, neither would the matter treated
   of, nor the persons for whose sakes chiefly this labour was undertaken,
   admit of an accurate scholastical procedure in all parts of the
   treatise. The doctrine asserted and the error opposed are the
   concernment of the common people of Christianity. Arminianism is crept
   into the bodies of sundry congregations, and the weaker men are who
   entertain it, the more gross and carnal are their notions and
   conceptions in and about it. Pelagius himself was never so injurious to
   the grace of God as some amongst us. Now, the souls of [the] men whose
   good is sought in this work are no less precious in the sight of God,
   though they are unacquainted with philosophical terms and ways of
   arguing, than the souls of the most learned. Besides, that which we
   account our wisdom and learning may, if too rigorously attended, be our
   folly. When we think to sharpen the reason of the Scripture, we may
   straiten the efficacy of the spirit of it. It is oftentimes more
   effectual in its own liberty than when restrained to our methods of
   arguing, and the weapons of it keener in their own soft breathings than
   when sharpened in the forge of Aristotle. There is a way of persuasion
   and conviction in the Scriptures that is more divine and sublime than
   to be reduced to any rules of art that men can reach unto. God in his
   word instructs men, to make them "wise unto salvation." Syllogisms are
   not, doubtless, the only way of making men wise with human wisdom, much
   less divine. Some testimonies, on this account, are left at their own
   liberty, improved only by explanation, that they might lose nothing of
   their own strength, seeing no other can be added to them. Where the
   corrupt philosophy, or sophistical arguings, or, indeed, regular
   syllogistical proceedings, of the adversaries, have rendered a more
   close, logical way of proceeding necessary, I hope your favourable
   judgments will not find cause to complain of the want thereof. Whatever
   is amiss, whatever is defective, whatever upon any account cometh short
   of desire or expectation, as I know none in the world more able to
   discern and find out than yourselves, so there are none from whom I can
   expect, and justly promise myself, a more easy and candid censure, a
   more free and general pardon, a more favourable acceptation of this
   endeavour for the service of the truth, than from you. Besides that
   personal amity and respect which God by his providence hath given me
   (one altogether unworthy of such an alloy of common perplexities in his
   pilgrimage) with you and amongst you, besides that readiness and
   ingenuous promptness of mind unto condescension and candid reception of
   labours in this kind which your own great worth and abilities furnish
   you withal, exempting you and lifting you above that pedantic severity
   and humour of censure which possesseth sciolists and men corrupted with
   a desire of emerging in the repute of others, you know full well in
   what straits, under what diversions, employments, business of sundry
   natures, incumbent on me from the relations wherein I stand in the
   university, and on sundry other accounts, this work hath been carried
   on. The truth is, no small portion of it owes its rise to journeys, and
   such like avocations from my ordinary course of studies and
   employments, with some spare hours, for the most part in time of
   absence from all books and assistances of that nature whatever. Not
   longer to be burdensome unto you with things of no greater concernment
   than what may have respect to one every way so unworthy as myself, what
   is of the seed which God graciously supplied, I am sure will find
   acceptance with you; and what is of its worthless author, or that I
   have added, I am fully content may be consumed by the fire that tries
   our works of what sort they are.

   My daily prayer, honoured brethren, shall be on your behalf, that in
   the days wherein we see so many fall from the truth and oppose it on
   the one hand, a great indifference as to the things of God leading
   captive so many on the other, so few remaining made useful to God in
   their generations by a conjunction of zeal for the truth and ability
   unto its defence, and those for the most part so closely engaged in,
   and their hands so filled with, the work of public beseeching men to be
   reconciled to God in Christ, and building up of them who are called in
   their most holy faith, you may receive help from above, and
   encouragement to engage you by all means possible to spread abroad a
   savour of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and to labour continually that
   the truths of God (for whose defence you are particularly appointed)
   may not be cast down, nor trampled on under the feet of men of corrupt
   minds, lying in wait to deceive, alluring and beguiling unstable souls
   with enticing words of human wisdom, or any glorious show and pretence
   whatever, turning them from the simplicity of the gospel and the truth
   as it is in Jesus; that you may not faint nor wax weary,
   notwithstanding all the opposition, contempt, scorn, you do or may meet
   withal, nor even be turned aside to corrupt dalliances with error and
   falsehood, as is the manner of some, who yet would be accounted sound
   in the faith; but keeping close to the form of wholesome words, and
   answering the mould of gospel doctrine, whereinto you have been cast,
   may shine as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
   knowing that it is but yet a little while, and he that shall come will
   come, and will not tarry. Yea, come, Lord Jesus, come. So prays your
   unworthy fellow-labourer and brother in our dear Lord Jesus,

   John Owen.

A preface to the reader.

   Reader,

   If thy inquiry be only after the substance of the truth in the ensuing
   treatise contended for, I desire thee not to stay at all upon this
   preliminary discourse, but to proceed thither where it is expressly
   handled from the Scriptures, without the intermixture of any human
   testimonies or other less necessary circumstances, wherein perhaps many
   of them may not be concerned whose interest yet lies in the truth
   itself, and it is precious to their souls. That which now I intend and
   aim at is, to give an account to the learned reader of some things
   nearly relating to the doctrine whose protection, in the strength of
   Him who gives to his [servants] suitable helps for the works and
   employments he calls them to, I have undertaken, and what entertainment
   it hath formerly found and received in the church, and among the saints
   of God. For the accomplishment of this intendment a brief mention of
   the doctrine itself will make way. Whom in this controversy we intend
   by the names of "saints" and "believers," the treatise following will
   abundantly manifest. The word perseverantia is of most known use in
   ecclesiastical writers: Austin hath a book with the inscription of it
   on its forehead. The word in the New Testament signifying the same
   thing is epimone. Of them that followed Paul, it is said that he
   "persuaded them epimenein te chariti tou Theou," Acts xiii. 43; that
   is, "to persevere." Hupomone is of the same import: Ho de hupomeinas
   eis telos houtos sothesetai, Matt. x. 22, -- "He that persevereth to
   the end." The Vulgar Latin renders that word almost constantly by
   persevero. Karteria is a word also of the same signification, and which
   the Scripture useth to express the same thing. Kratos is sometimes by a
   metathesis expressed kartos; thence is karta, valde; and kartereo,
   spoken of him who is of a valiant, resolved mind. "By faith Moses left
   Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, ton gar aoraton hos horon
   ekarterese," Heb. xi. 27; -- "As eyeing the Invisible, he endured (his
   trial) with a constant, valiant mind." Proskartereo from thence is most
   frequently to persevere, Acts i. 14; and Esan de proskarterountes te
   didache ton apostolon, Acts ii. 42, -- "They persevered in the doctrine
   of the apostles." Proskarteresis, once used in the New Testament, is
   rendered by our translators, "perseverance," Eph. vi. 18. In what
   variety of expression the thing is revealed in the Scripture is in the
   treatise itself abundantly declared. The Latin word is classical:
   persevero is constanter sum severus. In that sense, as Seneca says,
   "Res severa est verum gaudium." Its extreme in excess is pertinacy, if
   these are not rather distinguished from their objects than in
   themselves. Varro, lib. iv. De Ling. Lat., tells us that pertinacia is
   a continuance or going on in that wherein one ought not to continue or
   proceed; perseverantia is that whereby any one continues in that
   wherein he ought so to do. Hence is that definition of it commonly
   given by the schoolmen from Austin, lib. lxxxiii. qu. 31, who took it
   from Cicero (one they little acquainted themselves withal), lib. ii. De
   Invent. cap. liv. It is, say they, "In ratione bene consideratâ
   stabilis et perpetua permansio."

   And this at present may pass for a general description of it that is
   used in an ethical and evangelical sense. Perseverance was accounted a
   commendable thing among philosophers. Morally, perseverance is that
   part of fortitude whereby the mind is established in the performance of
   any good and necessary work, notwithstanding the assaults and
   opposition it meets withal, with that tediousness and wearisomeness
   which the protraction of time in the pursuit of any affairs is attended
   withal. Aristotle informs us that it is exercised about things
   troublesome, lib. vii. cap. vi., Eth. Nicom., giving a difference
   between continence with its opposite vice, and forbearance or
   perseverance: Touton d' ho men peri hedonas, akrates, ho d' enkrates.
   Ho de peri lupas malakos, ho de karterikos. He that abides in his
   undertaken work, so it be good and honest, notwithstanding that trouble
   and perplexity he may meet withal, is karterikos. Hence he tells us
   that karterikos zen, as well as sophronos, is not pleasant to many,
   lib. x. cap. ix.; and that because so to live implies difficulty and
   opposition. And he also, as Varro in the place above mentioned,
   distinguishes it from pertinacy. And of men infected with that depraved
   habit of mind he says there are three sorts, idiognomones, amatheis,
   and agroikoi. All these are, in his judgment, ischurognomones, Nicom.,
   lib. vii. cap. ix.; which perverse disposition of spirit he there
   dearly manifests to be sufficiently differenced from a stable, resolved
   frame of mind, whatever it may resemble it in. Now, though there is no
   question but that of two persons continuing in the same work or
   opinion, one may do it out of pertinacy, the other out of perseverance,
   yet amongst men, who judge of the minds of others by their fruits, and
   of the acts of their minds by their objects, these two dispositions or
   habits are universally distinguished, as before by Varro. Hence the
   terms of "pertinacy" and "obstinacy" being thrust into the definition
   of heresy by them who renounce any infallible living judge and
   determiner in matters of faith, to make way for the inflicting of
   punishment on the entertainers and maintainers thereof. They take no
   thought of proving it such, but only because it is found in persons
   embracing such errors. The same affection of mind, with the same fruits
   and demonstrations of it, in persons embracing the truth, would by the
   same men he termed perseverance. But this is not that whereof I treat.

   Evangelical perseverance is from the Scripture at large explained in
   the book itself. As it relates to our acceptation with God, and the
   immutability of justification (which is the chief and most eminent part
   of the doctrine contended for), as it hath no conformity in any thing
   with the moral perseverance before described, so indeed it is not
   comprehended in that strict notion and signification of the word itself
   which denotes the continuation of some act or acts in us, and not the
   uninterruptibleness of any act of God. This, then, is the cause of
   perseverance, rather than perseverance itself, yet such a cause as
   being established, the effect will certainly and uncontrollably ensue.
   They who go about to assert a perseverance of saints cut off from the
   absolute unchangeableness of the decree, purpose, and love of God,
   attended with a possibility of a contrary event, and that not only in
   respect of the free manner of its carrying on, whereby he that wills to
   persevere may not will so to do, but also in respect of the issue and
   end itself, will, I doubt not, if they are serious in what they
   pretend, find themselves entangled in their undertaking. As
   perseverance is a grace in the subjects on whom it is bestowed, so it
   relates either to the spiritual habit of faith or the principle of new
   life they have received from God, or to the actual performance of those
   duties wherein they ought to abide. In the first sense it consists in
   the point of being or not being. Whilst the habit of faith remains,
   there is in respect thereof an uninterrupted perseverance in him in
   whom it is; and this we contend for. As it respects actions flowing
   from that habit and principle, it expatiates itself in a large field;
   for as it imports not at all a perpetual performance of such acts
   without intermission (which were naturally as well as spiritually
   impossible, whilst we carry about us a "body of death"), so neither
   doth it necessarily imply a constant tenor of proceeding in the
   performance of them, but is consistent with a change in degrees of
   performance, and in other respects also not now to be insisted on.
   Perseverance in this sense being the uninterrupted continuance of
   habitual grace in the hearts of believers, without intercision, with
   such a walking in obedience as God, according to the tenor of the new
   covenant, will accept, upon the whole of the matter it is in its own
   nature (as every thing else is that hath not its being from itself)
   liable and obnoxious to alteration; and therefore must be built and
   reposed on that which is in itself immutable, that it may be rendered,
   on that supposition, immutable also. Therefore is perseverance in this
   sense resolved into that cause of it before mentioned; which to do is
   the chief endeavour of the following treatise. Of the groundlessness of
   their opinion who, granting final perseverance, do yet plead for the
   possibility of a final apostasy and an intercision of faith, no more
   need be spoken but what, upon the account last mentioned, hath been
   argued already. Some discourses have passed both of old and of late
   concerning the nature of this perseverance, and wherein it doth
   properly consist. Many affirm it not really to differ from the habit of
   faith and love itself; for which Bradwardin earnestly contends, lib.
   ii. De Cau. Dei. cap. vii., concluding his disputation, that
   "Perseverantia habitualis est justitia habitualiter preservata;
   perseverantia actualis est justitiæ perseverantia actualis, ipsum vero
   perseverare, est justitiam præservare;" whereupon ("suo more:") he
   infers this corollary: "Quod nomen perseverantiæ nullam rem absolutam
   essentialiter significat, sed accidentaliter, et relative, charitatem
   videlicet, sive justitiam, cum respectu futuræ permansionis continue
   usque in finem; et quod non improbabiliter posset dici perseverantiam
   esse ipsam relationem hujus." And therefore in the next chapter, to
   that objection, "If perseverance be no more but charity or
   righteousness, then every one that hath once obtained these, or true
   grace, must also persevere," he returns no answer at all, plainly
   insinuating his judgment to be so; of which afterward. And therefore he
   spends his 13th chapter of the same book to prove that the Holy Spirit
   is that "auxilium," as he called it, whereby any persevere. And, chap.
   i., he resolves all preservation from being overcome by temptation, or
   not being tempted to a prevalency (the same for substance with
   perseverance), into the will and purpose of God. "Quicunque," saith he,
   "non tentatur, hoc necessario est a deo, quod non tentatur. Sicut 11^a
   pars 13^i primi probat; et per 22^um primi, Deus necessario habet
   aliquem actum voluntatis circa talem non tentationem, et non
   nolitionem, quia tunc per decimum primi non tentaretur, ergo
   volitionem, quæ per idem decimum ipsum tentari non sinit," etc. Others
   render it as a gift superadded to faith and love; of which judgment
   Austin seems to have been, who is followed by sundry of the schoolmen,
   with many of the divines of the reformed churches. Hence is that
   conclusion of Alvarez, De Auxil., lib. x. disp. 103, "Secundum fidem
   catholicam asserendum est, præter gratiam habitualem et virtutes
   infusas esse necessarium ad perseverandum in bono usque in finem
   auxilium speciale, supernaturale scilicet donum perseverantiæ." And of
   this proposition he says, "In hac omnes catholici conveniunt." Of the
   same judgment was his master, Thomas, lib. 3 Con. Gen. cap. clv.;
   where, also, he gives this reason of his opinion: "Illud quod natura
   sua est variabile, ad hoc quod figatur in uno, indiget auxilio alicujus
   moventis immobilis; sed liberum arbitrium, etiam existens in gratia
   habituali, ad huc manet variabile, et flexibile a bono in malum: ergo
   ad hoc quod figatur in bono, et perseveret in illo usque ad finem,
   indiget speciali Dei auxilio:" -- the same argument having been used
   before him by Bradwardin, though to another purpose, namely, not to
   prove perseverance to be a superadded gift to saving grace, which, as
   before was observed, he denied, but to manifest that it was immediately
   and wholly from God. His words are, lib. ii. cap. viii., Corol., "Sicut
   secundum primi docet, omne quod est naturale, et non est per se tale,
   seal est mutabile in non tale, si manere debeat immutatum, oportet quod
   innitatur continue alicui per se fixo; quare et continue quilibit
   justus Deo." The same schoolmen also (a generation of men exceeding
   ready to speak of any thing, though they know not what they speak nor
   whereof they affirm) go yet farther, some of them, and will distinguish
   between the gift of perseverance and the gift [of] confirmation in
   grace! He before mentioned, after a long dispute (namely, 104),
   concludes: "Ex his sequitur differentiam inter donum perseverantiæ et
   confirmationis in gratia" (he means that which is granted in via) "in
   hoc consistere, quod donum perseverantiæ nullam perfectionem
   intrinsecam constituit in ipsa gratia habituali, quod tamen
   perfectionem intrinsecam illi tribuit confirmatio in gratia." What this
   intrinsical perfection of habitual grace, given it by confirmation, is,
   he cannot tell; for in those who are so confirmed in grace he asserts
   only an impeccability upon supposition, and that not alone from their
   intrinsical principle, as it is with the blessed in heaven, but from
   help and assistance also daily communicated from without. Durandus, in
   3 d. 3 q. 4, assigns the deliverance from sin, which those who are
   confirmed in grace do obtain, unto the Holy Ghost. So far well; but he
   kicks down his milk by his addition, that he doth it only by the
   removal of all occasion of sin. But of these persons, and their
   judgment on the point under debate, more afterward.

   For the thing itself last proposed, on what foot of account it is
   placed, and on what foundation asserted, the treatise itself will
   discover. That the thing aimed at is not to be straitened or restrained
   to any one peculiar act of grace will easily appear. The main
   foundation of that which we plead for is the eternal purpose of God,
   which his own nature requireth to be absolutely immutable and
   irreversible. The eternal act of the will of God designing some to
   salvation by Christ, infallibly to be obtained, for "the praise of the
   glory of his grace," is the bottom of the whole, even that foundation
   which standeth for ever, having this seal, "The Lord knoweth them that
   are his." For the accomplishment of this eternal purpose, and for the
   procurement of all the good things that lie within the compass of its
   intendment, are the oblation and intercession, the whole mediatory
   undertaking of Christ, taking away sin, bringing in life and
   immortality, interposed, giving farther causal influence into the truth
   contended for. In him and for his sake, as God graciously, powerfully,
   and freely gives his Holy Spirit;, faith, and all the things that
   accompany salvation, unto all them whom he accepts and pardons, by his
   being made "sin for them" and "righteousness unto them;" so he takes
   them thereby into an everlasting covenant that shall not be broken, and
   hath therein given them innumerable promises that he will continue to
   be their God for ever, and preserve them to be, and in being, his
   people. To this end, because the principle of grace and living to him,
   as in them inherent, is a thing in its own nature, changeable and
   liable to failing, he doth, according to his promise, and for the
   accomplishment of his purpose, daily make out to them, by his Holy
   Spirit, from the great treasury and storehouse thereof, the Lord Jesus
   Christ, helps and supplies, increasing of faith, love, and holiness,
   recovering them from falls, healing their backslidings, strengthening
   them with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience
   and longsuffering with joyfulness; so preserving them by his power
   through faith unto salvation. And in this way of delivering the
   doctrine contended about, it is clearly made out that the disputes
   mentioned are as needless as groundless; so that we shall not need to
   take them into the state of the controversy in hand, though I shall
   have occasion once more to reflect upon them when I come to the
   consideration of the doctrine of the schoolmen in reference to the
   opinion proposed to debate. The main of our inquiry is after the
   purpose, covenant, and promises of God, the undertaking of Christ, the
   supplies of grace promised and bestowed in him; on which accounts we do
   assert and maintain that all true believers, -- who are, in being so,
   interested in all those causes of preservation, -- shall infallibly be
   preserved unto the end in the favour of God, and in such a course of
   gospel obedience as he will accept in Jesus Christ.

   That, as was formerly said, which at present I aim at in reference to
   this truth is, to declare its rise and progress, its course and
   opposition, which it hath found in several ages of the church, with its
   state and condition at this day, in respect of acceptance with the
   people of God.

   Its rise, with all other divine truths, it owes only to revelation from
   God, manifested in the scriptures of the Old and New Testament. Some of
   the most eminent places wherein it is delivered in the Old Testament
   are, Gen. iii. 15, xvii. 1; Deut. xxxiii. 3; Josh. i. 5; 1 Sam. xii.
   22; Ps. i. 3, xxiii. 4, 6, xxxvii. 39, 40, lii. 8, 9, lxxxix. 31-36,
   xxxiii. 9-11, xcii. 12, etc.; Isa. xxvii. 3, xlvi. 4, lix. 21, liv. 9,
   10, iv. 5, 6, xl. 27-31, xliii. 1-7; Jer. iii. 23, xxxi. 31-34, xxxii.
   38-40; Ezek. xxxvi. 25-27; Hos. ii. 19, 20; Zech. x. 12; Mal. iii. 6,
   with innumerable other places. In the New Testament God hath not left
   this truth and work of his grace without witness; as in sundry other
   places, so it is testified unto Matt. vi. 13, vii. 24, 25, xii. 20,
   xvi. 18, xxiv. 24; Luke i. 70-75, viii. 8, xxii. 32; John iii. 36, iv.
   13, 14, v. 24, vi. 35-57, vii. 38, 39, viii. 35, 36, x. 27-30, xiii. 1,
   xiv. 15-17, xvi. 27, xvii. throughout; Acts ii. 47, xiii. 48; Rom. vi.
   14, viii. 1, 16, 17, 28-34, etc.; 1 Cor. i. 8, 9, x. 13, 14, xv. 49,
   58; 2 Cor. i. 21, 22; Eph. i. 13, 14, iii. 17, iv. 30, v. 25-27; Gal.
   ii. 20; Phil. i. 6, ii. 13; 1 Thess. v. 24; 2 Tim. iv. 17, 18; Titus i.
   1; Heb. vi. 19, x. 38, 39, xii. 9, 10, xiii. 5; 1 Pet. i. 2-5; 1 John
   ii. 19, 27, iii. 9, 19, v. 13, 18; Jude 1; Rev. xx. 6. So plentifully
   hath the Lord secured this sacred truth, wherein he hath inwrapped so
   much (if not, as in the means of conveyance, the whole) of that peace,
   consolation, and joy, which he is willing the heirs of promise should
   receive. Whether the faith hereof, thus plentifully delivered to the
   saints, found acceptance with the primitive Christians, to the most of
   whom it was "given not only to believe but also to suffer for Christ,"
   to me is unquestionable. And I know no better proof of what those first
   churches did believe than by showing what they ought to believe; which
   I shall unquestionably be persuaded they did believe, unless most
   pregnant testimony be given of their apostasy. That Paul believed it
   for himself and concerning others is evident. Rom. viii. 38, 39; 1 Cor.
   i. 8, 9; Phil. i. 6; Heb. vi. 9, 10, are sufficient proof of his faith
   herein. That he built up others in the same persuasion, to the
   enjoyment of the same peace and assurance with himself, is undeniable.
   And if there be any demonstration to be made of the belief of the first
   Christians, if any evidence comparable unto this, I shall not deny but
   that it ought to be attended unto. But that we may not seem willing to
   decline the consideration of what those who went before us in the
   several ages and generations past apprehended, and have by any means
   communicated unto us of their thoughts, about the business of our
   contest (having no reason so to be), I shall, after a little
   preparation made to that work, present the reader with something of my
   observations to that end and purpose.

   Of the authority of the ancients in matters of religion and the worship
   of God, of the right use and improvement of their writings, of the
   several considerations that are to be had and exercised by them who
   would read them with profit and advantage, after many disputes and
   contests between the Papists and divines of the reformed churches, the
   whole concernment of that controversy is so clearly stated, managed,
   and resolved by Monsieur Daillé, in his book of the "Right Use of the
   Fathers," that I suppose all farther labour in that kind may be well
   spared. Those who intend to weigh their testimony to any head of
   Christian doctrine do commonly distinguish them into three great
   periods of time. The first of these is comprehensive of them who lived
   and wrote before the doctrine concerning which they are called out to
   give in their thoughts and verdict had received any signal opposition,
   and eminent discussion in the church on that account. Such are the
   writers of the first three hundred years, before the Nicene council, in
   reference to the doctrine of the Trinity; and so the succeeding
   writers, before the stating of the Macedonian, Eutychian, and Nestorian
   heresies. In the next are they ranked who bare the burden and heat of
   the opposition made to any truth, and on that occasion wrote expressly
   and at large on the controverted doctrines; which is the condition of
   Athanasius, Basil, Gregory, and some others, in that Arian controversy.
   And in the last place succeed those who lived after such concussions,
   which are of less or more esteem, according as the doctrines inquired
   after were less or more corrupted in the general apostasy of the latter
   days. According to this order, our first period of time will end with
   the rise of the Pelagian heresy, which gave occasion to the thorough,
   full, and clear discussion of the whole doctrine concerning the grace
   of God, whereof that in whose defence we are engaged is no small
   portion; the next, of those whom God raised up to make head against
   that subtle opposer of his grace, with his followers, during the space
   of a hundred years and somewhat onwards ensuing the promulgation of
   that heresy. What have been the thoughts of men in the latter ages
   until the Reformation, and of the Romanists since to this day,
   manifested in a few pregnant instances, will take up the third part of
   this design. Of the judgment of the Reformed Churches, as they are
   commonly called, I shall speak particularly in the close of this
   discourse. For the first of these: Not to insist on the paucity of
   writers in the first three hundred years, sundry single persons in the
   following ages have severally written three times as much as we have
   left and remaining of all the others (the names of many who are said to
   have written being preserved by Eusebius, Eccles. Hist., and Hierom,
   Lib. de Script., their writings being perished in their days), nor in
   general of that corruption whereunto they have almost every one of them
   been unquestionably exposed, I must be forced to preface the nomination
   of them with some considerations:--

   1. The first [consideration will be found] in that known passage of
   Hegesippus, in Euseb. Hist. Eccles., lib. iii. cap. xxxii.: Hos ara
   mechri ton tote chronon, parthenos kathara kai adiaphthoros emeinen he
   ekklesia; -- eis d' ho hieros ton apostolon choros diaphoron eilephei
   tou biou telos, pareleluthei te he genea ekeine ton autais akoais tes
   entheou sophias epakousai katexiomenon, tenikauta tes atheou planes ten
   archen elambanen he sustasis, dia tes ton eterodidaskalon apates, ohi
   kai, ate medenos eti ton apostolon leipomenou, gumne loipon edn te
   kephale to tes aletheias kerugmati ten pseudonumon gnosin antikeruttein
   epecheiroun. So far he, setting out the corruption of the church, even
   as to doctrine, immediately after the apostles fell asleep; whereof
   whosoever will impartially, and with disengaged judgment, search into
   the writings of those days that do remain, will perhaps find more cause
   than is commonly imagined with him to complain.

   2. The main work of the writers of the first ages being to contend with
   heathenish idolaters, to convince them of their madness and folly; to
   write apologies for the worship of God in Christ in general, so to
   dissuade their rulers from persecution; or in contesting with heretics,
   for the most part appearing to be men either corrupt in their lives, or
   mad and brain-sick, as we say, as to their imaginations, or denying the
   truth of the person of Christ, -- what can we expect from them as
   delivered directly and on set purpose to the matter of our present
   contest? Some principles may in them possibly be discovered from
   whence, by a regular deduction, some light may be obtained into their
   thoughts concerning the points in difference. Thus Junius thinks, and
   not without cause, that the whole business of predestination may be
   stated upon this one principle, "That faith is the free gift of God,
   flowing from his predestination and mercy;" and concerning this he
   saith, "Hoc autem omnes patres uno consensu ex Christo et Paulo
   agnoverunt; ipse Justinus Martyr in Apolog. ii., et gravissime veto
   Clemens Alexandrinus, in hac alioquin palæstra non ita exercitatus ut
   sequentia secula," Hom., lib. ii. "Basilii et Valentini dogma esse
   dicit, quod fides a natura sit," Consid. Senten. Pet. Baroni. Without
   this what advantage can be taken, or what use can be made, for the
   discovery of the mind of any of the ancients, by cropping off some
   occasional expressions from their occasions and aims, I know not.
   Especially would I more peremptorily affirm this could I imagine any of
   them wrote as Jerome affirms of himself that he sometimes did, Epist.
   ad August., which is among his epistles, lxxxix. T. 2. "Itaque," saith
   he, "ut simpliciter fateor, legi hæc omnia, et in mente mea plurima
   coacervans, accito notario vel mea, vel aliena dictavi, nec ordinis,
   nec verborum interdum nec sensuum memor." Should any one say so of
   himself in these days, he would be accounted little better than a
   madman. Much, then, on this account (or at least not much to the
   purpose) is not to be expected from the fathers of the first ages.

   3. Another observation to our purpose lies well expressed in the
   beginning of the 14th chapter of Bellarmine's second book de Grat. et
   Lib. Arbit. "Præter Scripturas adferunt alia testimonia patrum," saith
   he, speaking of those who opposed God's free predestination; to which
   he subjoins, "Neque est hoc novum argumentum, sed antiquissimum.
   Scribit enim S. Prosper in Epistola ad S. Augustinum, Gallos qui
   sententiam ejusdem Augustini de predestinatione calumniabantur, illud
   potissimum objicere solitos quod ea sententia doctrinæ veterum
   videbatur esse contraria. Sed respondet idem Augustinus in Lib. de Bono
   Perseverantiæ, veteres patres, qui ante Pelagium floruerunt, quæstionem
   istam nunquam accurate tractasse sed incidenter solum, et quasi per
   transitum illam attigisse. Addit vero, in fundamento hujus sententiæ
   (quod est gratiam Dei non præveniri ab ullo opere nostro sed contra, ab
   illa omnia opera nostra præveniri, ira ut nihil omnino boni, quod
   attinet ad salutem sit in nobis, quod non est nobis ex Deo), convenire
   Catholicos omnes; et ibidem citat Cyprianum, Ambrosium, et Nazianzenum,
   quibus addere possumus Basilium et Chrysostomum." To the same purpose,
   with application to a particular person, doth that great and holy
   doctor discourse, De Doctrin. Christiana, lib. iii. cap. xxxiii. Saith
   he, "Non erat expertus hanc hæresin Tychonius, quæ nostro tempore
   exorta, multum nos, ut gratiam Dei, quæ per Dominum nostrum Jesum
   Christum est, adversus eam defenderemus exercuit, et secundum id quod
   ait apostolus, "oportet hæreses esse, ut probati manifesti fiunt in
   nobis," multo vlgilantiores, diligentioresque reddidit, ut adverteremus
   in Scripturis sanctis, quod istum Tychonium minus attentum minusque,
   sine hoste solicitum fugit." That also of Jerome in his second Apology
   against Rufinus, in reference to a most weighty article of Christian
   religion, is known to all. "Fieri potest," saith he, "ut vel
   simpliciter erraverint, vel alio sensu scripserint, vel a librariis
   imperitis eorum paulatim scripta corrupta sint; vel certe antequam in
   Alexandria, quasi dæmonium meridianum, Arius nasceretur, innocenter
   quædam, et minus caute locuti sunt, et quæ non possunt perversorum
   hominum calumniam declinare." And what he spake of the writers before
   Arius in reference to the person of Christ, we may of them before
   Pelagius in reference to his grace. Hence Pererius, in Rom. cap. viii.,
   disput. 22, tells us (how truly ipse viderit, I am not altogether of
   his mind) that [as] for those authors that lived before Austin's time,
   all the Greek fathers, and a considerable part of the Latin, were of
   opinion that the cause of predestination was the foresight which God
   had either of men's good works or of their faith; either of which
   opinions, he assures us, is manifestly contrary to the authority of the
   Scriptures, and particularly to the doctrine of St Paul. I am not, as I
   said, wholly of his mind, partly upon the account of the observations
   made by his fellow-Jesuit out of Austin, before mentioned, partly upon
   other accounts also. Upon these and the like considerations, much, I
   presume, to the business in hand will not be produced on either side
   from the fathers that wrote before the rise of the Pelagian heresy. And
   if any one of the parties at this day litigant about the doctrine of
   the grace of God should give that advice that Sisinius and Agelius the
   Novatians sometimes gave, as Sozomen reports of them (Hist. Eccles.,
   lib. vii. cap. xii.), to Nectarius, by him communicated to the emperor
   Theodosius, to have the quarrel decided by those that wrote before the
   rise of the controversy, as it would be unreasonable in itself, so I
   persuade myself neither party would accept of the condition, neither
   had the Catholics of those days got any thing if they had attended to
   the advice of these Novatians. But, these few observations premised,
   something as to particular testimonies may be attended unto.

   That we may proceed in some order, not leaving those we have nothing to
   say to, nor are willing to examine, whilst, they are but thin and come
   not in troops, unsaluted, the first writings that are imposed on us
   after the canonical Scriptures are the eight books of Clemens, commonly
   called the Apostles' Constitutions, being pretended to be written by
   him at their appointment, with the Canons ascribed to the same persons.
   These we shall but salute: for besides that they are faintly defended
   by any of the Papists, disavowed and disclaimed as apocryphal by the
   most learned of them, as Bellarmine, De Script. Eccles. in Clem., who
   approves only of fifty canons out of eighty-five; Baronius, An. Dom.
   102, 14, who adds thirty more; and Binius, with a little enlargement of
   canons, in Tit. Can. T. 1, Con. p. 17; and have been thoroughly
   disproved and decried by all protestant writers that have had any
   occasion to deal with them; their folly and falsity, their impostures
   and triflings, have of late been so fully manifested by Dallæus, De
   Pseudepigraphis Apostol., that nothing need be added thereunto. Of him
   may Doctor H. H. [5] learn the truth of that insinuation of his,
   Dissert. de Episcop. ii. cap. vi. sect. 3, "Canone apostolico secundo
   semper inter genuinos habito;" but of the confidence of this author in
   his assertions afterward. This, indeed (insisted on by Dallæus, and the
   learned Usher in his notes upon Ignatius), is childishly ridiculous in
   them, that whereas it is pretended that these Constitutions were made
   at a convention of the apostles, as lib. vi. cap. xiv., they are
   brought in discoursing hemeis oun epi to auto genomenoi, Petros kai
   Andreas, Iakobos kai Ioannes huioi Zebedaiou, etc. They are made to
   inform us, lib. ii. cap. lvii., that the Acts written by Luke and read
   in the churches are theirs, and the four books of the Gospel; whereas
   the story of the death of James (here said to be together with the
   apostles) is related Acts xii., and John, by the consent of all, wrote
   not his Gospel until after the dissolution of his associates. Also,
   they make Stephen and Paul to be together at the making of those
   Constitutions, lib. viii. cap. iv. (whereas the martyrdom of Stephen
   was before the conversion of Paul), and yet also mention the stoning of
   Stephen, lib. viii. cap. xlvi. They tell us whom they appointed bishops
   of Jerusalem after the death of James, and yet James is one of them who
   is met together with them, lib. vii. cap. xlviii. Nay, mention is made
   of Cerinthus, and that Mark the heretic, Menander, Basilides, and
   Saturninus, were known and taken notice of by the apostles, who all
   lived in the second century, about the reign of Hadrian, as Eusebius
   manifesteth, and Clem. Alex., Strom., lib. vii.

   But, to leave such husks as these unto them who loathe manna, and will
   not feed on the bread that our heavenly Father hath so plentifully
   provided for all that live in his family or any way belong to his
   house, let us look onward to them that follow, of whose truth and
   honesty we have more assurance.

   The first genuine piece that presents itself unto us on the roll of
   antiquity is that epistle of Clemens which, in the name of the church
   of Rome, he wrote to the divided church of Corinth; which being
   abundantly testified to of old, to the great contentment of the
   Christian world, was published here at Oxford some few years since, --
   a writing full of ancient simplicity, humility, and zeal. As to our
   present business, much, I confess, cannot be pleaded from hence, beyond
   a negative impeachment of that great and false clamour which our
   adversaries have raised, of the consent of the primitive Christians
   with them in their by-paths and ways of error. It is true, treating of
   a subject diverse from any of those heads of religion about which our
   contests are, it is not to be expected that he should anywhere plainly,
   directly, and evidently, deliver his judgment unto them. This,
   therefore, I shall only say, that in that whole epistle there is not
   one word, iota, or syllable, that gives countenance to the tenet of our
   adversaries in the matter of the saints' perseverance; but that, on the
   contrary, there are sundry expressions asserting such a foundation of
   the doctrine we maintain as will with good strength infer the truth of
   it. Page 4, setting forth the virtues of the Corinthians before they
   fell into the schism that occasioned his epistle, he minds them that
   agon en humin hemeras te kai nuktos huper pases tes adelphotetos, eis
   to sozesthai met' eleous kai suneideseos ton arithmon ton eklekton
   autou. That God hath a certain number of elect to be saved, and for
   whose salvation, by his mercy, the church is to contend with him, is a
   principle wholly inconsistent with those on which the doctrine of the
   saints' apostasy is bottomed. Corresponding hereunto is that passage of
   his concerning the will of God, p. 12: Pantas oun tous agapetous autou
   boulomenos metanoias metaschein, esterixen to pantokratoriko boulemati
   autou. A mere consideration of this passage causeth me to recall what
   but now was spoken, as though the testimony given to the truth in this
   epistle were not so clear as might be desired. The words now repeated
   contain the very thesis contended for. It is the beloved of God (or his
   chosen) whom he will have made partakers of saving repentance; and
   hereunto "he establisheth them" (for with that word is the defect in
   the sentence to be supplied) "by," or with, "the almighty will."
   Because he will have his beloved partakers of saving repentance and the
   benefits thereof; he confirms and establishes them in it with his
   omnipotent or sovereign will. The inconsistency and irreconcilableness
   of this assertion with the doctrine of these saints' apostasy, the
   learned reader needs not any assistance to manifest to him. Answerably
   hereunto he saith of God, Ekloges meros (hemas) epoiesen heauto, p. 38
   and p. 66: mentioning the blessedness of the forgiveness of sins, out
   of Ps. xxxii. he adds, Houtos ho makarismos egeneto epi tous
   eklelegmenous hupo tou Theou dia Iesou Christou tou Kuriou hemon. The
   elect of whom he speaks are those on whom, through and for Christ, God
   bestows the blessedness of justification; elect they are of God
   antecedently to the obtaining of that blessedness, and through that
   they do obtain it: so that in that short sentence of this author, the
   great pillar of the saints' perseverance, which is their free election,
   the root of all the blessedness which afterward they enjoy, is
   established. Other passages like to these there are in that epistle;
   which plainly deliver the primitive Christians of the church of Rome
   from any communion in the doctrine of the saints' apostasy, and
   manifest their perseverance in the doctrine of the saints'
   perseverance, wherein they had been so plentifully instructed, not long
   before, by the epistle of Paul unto them.

   He who upon the roll of antiquity presents himself in the next place to
   our consideration is the renowned Ignatius, concerning whom I desire to
   beg so much favour of the learned reader as to allow me a diversion
   unto some thoughts and observations that belong to another subject than
   that which I have now peculiarly in hand, before I come to give him a
   taste of his judgment on the doctrine under debate.

   As this Ignatius, bishop of the church at Antioch, was in himself a man
   of an excellent spirit, eminent in holiness, and to whom, on the behalf
   of Christ, it was given not only to believe on him, but also suffer for
   him, and on that account of very great and high esteem among the
   Christians of that age wherein he lived, and sundry others following,
   so no great question can be made but that he wrote, towards the end of
   his pilgrimage, when he was on his way to be offered up, through the
   Holy Spirit, by the mouths of wild beasts, to Jesus Christ, sundry
   epistles to sundry churches that were of chiefest note and name in the
   countries about. The concurrent testimony of the ancients in this
   matter of her will give as good assurance as in this kind we are
   capable of; Eusebius reckons them up in order, so doth Jerome.

   After them frequent mention is made of them by others, and special
   sayings in them are transcribed; and whereas it is urged by some that
   there is no mention of those epistles before the Nicene council, --
   before which time it is as evident as if it were written with the beams
   of the sun, that many false and supposititious writings had been
   imposed on and were received by many in the church (as the story of
   Paul and Thecla is mentioned and rejected by Tertull. de Baptis., Hermæ
   Pastor. by others), -- it is answered, that they were mentioned by
   Irenæus some good while before. Lib. v. cap. xxviii., saith he,
   "Quemadmodum quidam de nostris dixit, propter martyrium in Deum
   adjudicatus ad bestias; quoniam frumentum sum Christi et per dentes
   bestiarum molor ut mundus panis Dei inveniar." Which words, to the
   substance of them, are found in these epistles, though some say nothing
   is here intimated of any epistles or writings, but of a speech that
   might pass among the Christians by tradition, such as they had many
   among themselves, even of our Saviour's, some whereof are mentioned by
   Grotius on these words of Paul, "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
   how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive." What
   probability or ground for conviction there is in these or the like
   observations and answers is left to the judgment of all. This is
   certain, that the first mentioning of them in antiquities is to be
   clearly received (and that perhaps with more than the bare word of him
   that recites and approves of the Epistle of Jesus Christ to Abgarus the
   king of the Edessenes, or of him that reckons Seneca among the
   ecclesiastical writers upon the account of his epistles to Paul), or
   the following testimonies, which are heaped up in abundance by some who
   think (but falsely) that they have a peculiar interest inwrapped in the
   epistles now extant, will be of very small weight or value.

   For my part, I am persuaded, with that kind of persuasion wherein in
   things of no greater moment I am content to acquiesce, that he did
   write seven epistles, and that much of what he so wrote is preserved in
   those that are now extant; concerning which the contests of learned men
   have drawn deep and run high in these latter days, though little to the
   advantage of the most that have laboured in that cause, as shall be
   manifested in the process of our discourse.

   A late learned doctor, [6] in his dissertations about episcopacy, or
   dispute for it against Salmasius and Blondellus, tells us (that we may
   take a taste of his confidence in asserting), Dissert. ii. cap. xxiii.,
   sect. 1, that Salmasius and Blondellus "mortalium omnium primi" thought
   these epistles to be feigned or counterfeit. And with more words, cap.
   xxiv. sect. 1, he would make us believe that these epistles of Ignatius
   were always of the same esteem with that of Clemens from Rome to the
   Corinthians, of which he treats at large in his fourth dissertation, or
   that of Polycarpus to the Philippians, which we have in Eusebius; and
   then he adds, that in the judgment of Salmasius and Blondellus, "Solus
   Ignatius oichetai cujus tamen epistolæ pari semper cum illis per
   universam ab omni ævo patrum nostrorum memoriam reverentia
   excipiebantur; nec prius a mortalium quovis in judicium vocabantur
   (multo minus ut in re certa et extra dubium posita inter plane adokima
   et kibdela rejiciebantur), quam presbyteri Anglicani patribus suis
   contumeliam facere coepissent iisque aut suppetias ferre, aut rem
   gratam facere (quibus illecebris adducti nescio), hi duo non ignobiles
   Presbyteranæ causæ hyperaspistæ in seipsos recepissent." Of his two
   learned antagonists, one is dead, and the other almost blind, or
   probably they would have dealt not much more gently with the doctor for
   his parenthesis ("quibus illecebris adducti nescio"), than one of them
   formerly did (Salmas. De Subscribendis et Signandis Testamentis seu
   Specimen Consula. Animad. Heraldi., cap. i. p. 19, "Nuper quidem etiam
   nebulo in Anglia, Capellanus ut audio regis, Hammondus nomine, libro
   quem edidit de potestate clavium Salmasio iratus quod aliam quam ipse
   sententiam probet ac defendat, haud potuit majus convicium, quod ei
   dicerit, invenire, quam si grammaticum appellaret") for his terming him
   a grammarian; yet, indeed, of him (such was the hard entertainment he
   found on all hands), it is by many supposed that he was "illecebris
   adductus" (and they stick not to name the bait he was caught withal),
   wrought over in a manner to destroy the faith of that which he had
   before set up and established.

   For the thing itself affirmed by the doctor, I cannot enough admire
   with what oscitancy or contempt he considers his readers (of which
   manner of proceeding this is very far from being the only instance),
   that he should confidently impose such things upon them. He that hath
   written so much about Ignatius, and doth so triumph in his authority,
   ought doubtless to have considered those concernments of his author
   which are obvious to every ordinary inquirer. Vedelius' edition of
   Ignatius, at Geneva, came forth with his notes in the year 1623, long
   before either Salmasius or Blondellus had written any thing about the
   supposititiousness of these epistles; in the apology for Ignatius,
   thereto prefixed, he is forced to labour and sweat in the answer of
   one, whom he deservedly styles Virum doctissimum, arguing (not
   contemptibly) that Ignatius never wrote any such epistles, and that all
   those which were carried about in his name were false and counterfeit.

   But perhaps the doctor had taken caution of one of the fathers of his
   church, that "a Genevensibus istis typographis præter fraudes, et
   fucos, et præstigias non est quod quicquam expectemus" (Montacu. Appar.
   1, lib. v. sect. 47, p. 19), and so thought not fit to look into any
   thing that comes from them.

   Especially may this be supposed to have had some influence upon him,
   considering the gentle censure added in the next words by that reverend
   father of his church concerning the endeavour of Vedelius in his notes
   on that edition:-- "Neque audax ille et importunus Ignatii censor,
   quicquam attulit ad paginas suas implendas præter inscitiam, et
   incuriam, et impudentiam singularem (nec sævi magne sacerdos) dum ad
   suum Genevatismum antiquitatem detorquet invitissimam, non autem quod
   oportuit, Calvinismum amussitat ad antiquitatem." And what, I pray, is
   the reason of his episcopal censure? -- that he should deal with poor
   Vedelius in that language wherewith men of his order and authority were
   wont to deal with preaching ministers at their visitations? Why, this
   poor man, in that passage which you have in the Epistle to the
   Magnesians (in that edition, p. 56), when treating of the ancient
   fathers' expectations of the coming of Christ, retains the common
   reading of eis kenoteta elpidos elthon, referring the word to their
   expectation of seeing him come in the flesh, (which, upon the testimony
   of our Saviour himself, they desired to see, and saw it not,) not
   correcting it by a change of kenoteta into koinoteat elpidos so
   referring it to their faith in Christ and salvation by him, as, in his
   judgment, he ought to have done, -- Idou oligon pur, heliken hulen
   anaptei. A little thing would provoke the indignation of a prelate
   against any thing that came from Geneva.

   I say, I would suppose that this might divert our doctor from casting
   his eye upon Vedelius, whose defensative would have informed him that
   these epistles had been opposed as false and counterfeit before ever
   Salmasius or Blondellus had taken them into consideration, but that I
   find him sometimes insisting on that Geneva edition.

   For whereas (Dissert. ii. cap. ii. sect. 11) he tells you that he
   intends to abide only upon the edition of Isaac Vossius, in Greek,
   published from the archives of the library of Lorenzo de Medici, and
   the Latin edition published by bishop Usher, out of our library here at
   Oxford; yet, cap. viii., being pressed with the testimony of the writer
   of the Epistle to the Magnesians, in that edition, calling episcopacy
   neoteriken taxin, plainly intimating a comparative novelty in that
   order to others in the churches, and fearing (as well he might) that
   his translation of neoterike taxis into "the ordination of a young
   man," would scarce be received' by the men of his own prejudice (for
   surely he never supposed that he should impose on any other by such
   gross figments), he prefers the Vedelian edition, where these words are
   not so used, before it, and informs us that "sic legcndum" (as it is in
   the Geneva edition) "suadet tota epistolæ series." Now, this truly is
   marvellous to me (if the doctor consulteth authors any farther than
   merely to serve his present turn), how he could ever advise with that
   edition of Vedelius, and yet so confidently affirm that Salmasius and
   Blondellus were the first that rejected these epistles as feigned and
   counterfeited.

   But yet a little farther: The first edition of these epistles in Latin
   was Augustæ Vindelicorum, anno 1529; in Greek, at Basil, 1566: before
   which time, I suppose, the doctor expects not that any opposition
   should be made to them, considering the heaps of filth and dung that,
   until about that time, were owned for the offspring of the ancient
   fathers.

   Upon their first appearing in the world, what is the entertainment they
   receive? One who was dead before either the doctor or either of his
   antagonists was born, and whose renown among the people of God will
   live when they are all dead, gives them this welcome into the world:
   "Ignatium quod obtendunt, si velint quicquam habere momenti; probent
   apostolos legem tulisse de quadragesima, et similibus corruptelis,
   Nihil næniis istis quæ sub Ignatii nomine editæ sunt putidius. Quo
   minus tolerabilis est eorum impudentia qui talibus larvis ad fallendum
   se instruunt," Calv. Inst., lib. i. cap. xiii. sect. 29.

   Whatever be the judgment of our doctor concerning this man (as some
   there are of whom a learned bishop in this nation long ago complained,
   that they are still opening their mouths against Calvin, who helped
   them to mouths to speak with, Abbot. ad Thom.), he will in the judgment
   of some be so far accounted somebody as to take off from the confident
   assertion that Salmasius and Blondellus were "mortalium primi" that
   rejected these epistles.

   The Centuriators of Magdeburg were esteemed to be somebodies in their
   days, and yet they make bold to call these epistles into question, and
   to tender sundry arguments to the impairing of their credit and
   authority. This then they, Cent. ii. cap. x., De Episcop. Antioch. ac
   primum de Ignatio:--

   "Lectori pio et attento considerandum relinquimus quantum sit illis
   epistolis tribuendum. Non enim dubitamus quin in lectione earum
   cuilibet ista in mentem veniant; primum quod fere in omnibus epistolis,
   licet saris copiosis, occasio scribendi prætermittitur, nec vel
   divinare licet, quare potissimum ad hanc vel illam ecclesiam literas
   voluerit mittere. Deinde ipsius peregrinationis ratio non parvum
   injicit scrupulum considerantibus, quod multo rectiore et breviori
   itinere, Romam potuerit navigare, ut testatur vel ipsius Pauli
   exemplum. Expende quam longum sit iter, Antiochia ad littus Ægæi pelagi
   se recipere, ibique recta sursmn versus Septentrionem ascendere, et
   præcipuas civitates in littore sitas usque ad Troadem perlustrare, cum
   tamen Romanum iter sit destinatum versus occasum. Tertio res ejusmodi
   in istas literas inspersæ sunt ut ad eas propemodum obstupescat lector,
   etc. Hæc cum alias non somnolento lectori incidant, non
   existimaverimus," etc.

   Thus they, at the world's first awaking as to the consideration of
   things of this kind.

   To them add the learned Whitaker, Cont. prima, De Perfect. Script.
   quæst. sext. c. 12, where, after he hath disputed against the credit of
   these epistles, jointly and severally, with sundry arguments, at length
   he concludes, "Sed de his epistolis satis multa, et de hoc Ignatio quid
   judicandum sit, satis ex iis constare potest quæ diximus. Ista Papistæ
   non audent tueri," etc. To whom sundry others might be added,
   convincing Salmasius and Blondellus not to have been "mortalium primi"
   that called them into question.

   I have not insisted on what hath been spoken as though I were wholly of
   the mind of them who utterly condemn these epistles as false and
   counterfeit; though I know no possibility of standing before the
   arguments levied against them, notwithstanding the forementioned
   doctor's attempt to that purpose, without acknowledging so much
   corruption in them, additions and detractions from what they were when
   first written, as will render them not so clearly serviceable to any
   end or purpose whereunto their testimony may be required, as other
   unquestionable writings of their antiquity are justly esteemed to be.
   That these epistles have fallen into the hands of such unworthy
   impostors as have filled the latter ages with labour and travail to
   discover their deceits, the doctor himself granteth, Dissert. ii. cap.
   ii. sect. 6. "Nulla," saith he, "quidem nobis incumbit necessitas, ut
   in tanta exemplarium et editionum varietate et inconstantia, nihil
   uspiam Ignatio interpolatum aut adsutum affirmemus."

   And, indeed, the foisted passages in many places are so evident, yea
   shameful, that no man who is not resolved to say any thing, without
   care of proof or truth, can once appear in any defensative about them.
   Of this sort are the shreds and pieces out of that branded counterfeit
   piece of Clemens, or the Apostles' Constitutions, which are almost in
   every epistle packed in in a bungling manner, oftentimes disturbing the
   sense and coherence of the place; yea, sometimes such things are thence
   transcribed as in them are considerable arguments of their corruption
   and falsehood: so is that period in the Epistle to the Magnesians,
   taken from Clemens. Constitut., lib. vi. cap, ii., Abeddadan hosautos
   tes kephales aphaireitai di' homoian aitian. This Abeddadan being
   mentioned next after Absalom's dying by the loss of his head is
   therefore supposed to be Sheba, the son of Bichri; but whence that
   counterfeit Clemens had that name is not known. That the counterfeit
   Clemens by Abeddadan intended Sheba is evident from the words he
   assigns unto him in the place mentioned. Abeddadan said, Ouk esti moi
   meros en Dabid, oude kleronomia en huio Iessai. And he joins him with
   Absalom in his rebellion. Such passages as these they are supposed to
   have received from that vain and foolish impostor; but if it be true,
   which some have observed, that there is not the least mention made of
   any of these fictitious Constitutions in the first three ages after
   Christ, and that the didache apostolon mentioned by Eusebius and
   Athanasius, as also that diataxis in Epiphanius, are quite other things
   than those eight books of Constitutions we now have, it may rather be
   supposed that that sottish deceiver raked up some of his filth from the
   corruption of these epistles than that any thing out of him is crept
   into them. Other instances might be given of stuffing these epistles
   with the very garbage of that beast. Into what hands also these
   epistles have fallen by the way, in their journeying down towards these
   ends of the world, is evident from those citations made out of them by
   them of old, which now appear not in them. Theodoret, Dial. 3, adv.
   Hære., gives us this sentence from Ignatius: Eucharistian kai
   prosphoras ouk apodechontai dia to me homologein ten eucharistian sarka
   einai tou ooteros hemon Iesou Christou ten huper ton hamartion hemon
   pathousan hen chrestoteti ho Pater egeiren; which words you will
   scarcely find in that Epistle to the Church of Smyrna, from whence they
   were taken. Jerome also, Dial. 3, con. Pelag., hath this passage of him
   and from him: "Ignatius vir apostolicus et martyr scribit audacter,
   elegit Dominus apostolos qui super crones homines peccatores erant;"
   which words, as they are not now in these epistles, so, as one
   observes, if ever he wrote them, as is pretended, he did it audacter
   indeed. But of these things our doctor takes no notice.

   The style of these epistles doth not a little weaken the credit of
   them, being turgent, swelling with uncouth words and phrases, affected
   manner and ways of expression, new compositions of words, multiplying
   titles of honour to men, -- exceedingly remote and distant from the
   plainness and simplicity of the first writers among the Christians, as
   is evident by comparing these with the epistle of Clemens before
   mentioned, that of Polycarpus in Eusebius, [and of] the churches of
   Vienne and Lyons in that same author, and others. Instances for the
   confirmation of this observation are multiplied by Blondellus; my
   designed work will not allow me to insist on particulars. In many good
   words this charge is waived, by affirming that the author of these
   epistles was an Assyrian, and near to martyrdom, and that in the
   Scriptures there are sundry words of as hard a composition as those
   used by him, Ham. Dissert. ii. cap. iii.; and, as he says, from this
   kind of writing an argument of sufficient validity may be drawn to
   evince him to be the author of these epistles. Jerome was of another
   mind. Speaking of Didymus, "Imperitus," saith he, "sermone est, et non
   scientia, apostolicum virum ex ipso sermone exprimens, tam sensuum
   nomine quam simplicitate verborum." But seeing Ignatius was a Syrian,
   and near to martyrdom (though he writes his epistles from Troas and
   Smyrna, which, without doubt, were not in his way to Rome from Antioch,
   and yet everywhere he saith he is going to Rome: Ad Eph., Ta desma apo
   Surias mechri Rhomes periphero; which in the close he affirms he wrote
   from Smyrna, whither he was had to his martyrdom), what is it to any
   man what style he used in his writings, what swelling titles he gave to
   any, or words he made use of! Who shall call those writings (especially
   Ignatius being a Syrian) into question!

   But perhaps some farther question may here arise (and which hath by
   sundry been already started) about the use of divers Latin words in
   these epistles, which, doubtless, cannot be handsomely laid on the same
   account, of their author being a Syrian, and nigh to martyrdom.
   Akkepta, deposita, desertor, exemplarion, are usually instanced in,
   words to whose use no Roman customs, observations, orders, nor rules of
   government, do administer the least occasion. Of these the doctor tells
   you he wonders only that in so many epistles there are no more of this
   kind. And why so? The epistles are not so large a volume, a very few
   hours will serve to read them over; and yet I am persuaded, that in all
   that compass of reading in the Greek fathers which our doctor owns, he
   cannot give so many instances of words barbarous to their language, no
   way occasioned by the means before mentioned, as have been given in
   these epistles. But he wonders there are no more, and some wonder that
   all are not of his mind! But he farther informs us that a diligent
   reader of the Scripture may observe many more Latin words in the New
   Testament than are used in these epistles; and, for a proof of his
   diligence and observation, reckons up out of the end of Pasor's Lexicon
   sundry words of that kind made use of by the sacred writers. I fear,
   unto some men, this will scarce be an apology prevalent to the
   dismission of these epistles from under the censure of being at least
   foully corrupted. Of the whole collection of words of that sort made by
   Pasor, among which are those especially culled out by our doctor to
   confirm his observations, there is scarce one but either it is
   expressive of some Roman office, custom, money, order, or the like;
   words of which nature pass as proper names (as one of those mentioned
   by the doctor is, and no otherwise used in the New Testament) from one
   country and language to another, or are indeed of a pure Greek
   original, or at least were in common use in that age; neither of which
   can be spoken of the words above mentioned, used in the epistles, which
   were never used by any before or after them, nor is there any occasion
   imaginable why they should. "Parvas habent spes epistolæ, si tales
   habent." I would, indeed, gladly see a fair, candid, and ingenuous
   defensative of the style and manner of writing used in these epistles,
   departing so eminently from any thing that was customary in the
   writings of the men of those days, or is regular for men of any
   generation, in repetitions, affected compositions, barbarisms, rhyming
   expressions, and the like; for truly, notwithstanding any thing that
   hitherto I have been able to obtain for help in this kind, I am
   enforced to incline to Vedelius' answers to all the particular
   instances given of this nature, "This and that place are corrupted, --
   this is from Clemens' Constitutions, this from this or that tradition;"
   which, also, would much better free these epistles from the word siges,
   used in the sense whereunto it was applied by the Valentinians long
   after the death of Ignatius, than any other apology I have as yet seen
   for the securing of its abode in them.

   It is not a little burdensome to the thoughts of sober and learned men
   to consider how frequently, causelessly, absurdly, in the midst of
   discourses quite of another nature and tendency, the author of these
   epistles, or somebody for him, breaks in upon the commendation of
   church officers, bishops and presbyters, exalting them with titles of
   honour to the greatest potentates on earth, and comparing them to God
   the Father and Son; whereas none of the sacred writers that went before
   him, nor any of those good and holy men who, as is supposed, followed
   after him, do hold the least communion or society with him. Anankaion
   oun estin, hosaper poieite, aneu tou episkopou meden prattein humas,
   Epist. ad Tral. [cap. ii.], whereunto is immediately subjoined that
   doctrine concerning deacons which will scarcely be thought to be
   exegetical of Acts vi. 1-6, Dei de kai tous diakonous ontas musterion
   Christou Iesou kata panta tropon areskein; ou gar broton kai poton eisi
   diakonoi, alla, etc. And Ti gar estin episkopos? all' e pases arches
   kai exousias epekeina panton kraton, [cap. vii.] What the writer of
   this passage intended to make of a bishop well I know not; but thus he
   speaks of him, Epist. ad Magnes. [cap. iii.] Prepon oun esti kai humas
   hupakouein to episkopo humon; kai kata meden auto antilegein. Phoberon
   gar esti (as the apostle speaks concerning God, Heb. x. 27) to toiouto
   antilegein. Thus, indeed, some would have it, who, to help the matter,
   have farther framed such an episcopacy as was never thought on by any
   in the days of Ignatius, as shall afterward be made evident. And in the
   same epistle this is somewhat uncouth and strange, [cap. vi., vii.]:
   Henothnte to episkoto, hupotassomenoi to Theo di' autou en Christo.
   Hosper oun ho Kurios aneu tou Patros ouden poiei, ou dunamai gar,
   phesi, poiein at' emautou ouden; houto kai humeis haneu tou episkopou
   mede presbuteros, mede diakonos, mede laikos; mede ti phainestho humin
   eulogon para ten ekeinou gnomen. Whether the Lord Christ hath bound any
   such burden upon the shoulders of the saints I much question. Nor can I
   tell what to make of the comparison between God the Father and the
   bishop, Christ and the rest of the church, the whole sentence, in word
   and manner, being most remote from the least countenance from the
   sacred writings. Epist. ad Philadel. [cap. v.]: Hoi presbuteroi kai hoi
   diakonoi kai ho loipos kleros, hama panti to lao kai tois stratiotais,
   kai tois archousi kai to Kaisari (well aimed, however), to episkoto
   peitharcheitosan. The Epistle to the Church of Smyrna is full of such
   stuff, inserted without any occasion, order, coherence, or any colour
   to induce us to believe that it is part of the epistle as first
   written. One passage may not omit [cap. ix.]: Tima, phesin, huie ton
   Theon, kai basilea; ego de phemi (in the language of our Saviour
   repudiating the Pharisees' corrupted glosses on the law), tima men ton
   Theon hos aition ton holon kai Kurion, episkopon de hos archierea,
   Theou eikona phorounta, kata men to archein, Theou, kata de to
   hierateuein Christou; kai meta touton timan chre kai basilea. So
   Peter's mistake is corrected. His reasons follow: Oute gar Theou tis
   chreitton, e paraplesios en pasi tois ousin; oute de en ekklesia
   episkopou ti meizon hieromenou Theo huper tes tou kosmou pantos
   soterias, (as was Jesus Christ). And it is added: Ei gar ho basileusin
   epegeiromenos, kolaseos axios dikaios genesetai, hos ge puraluon ten
   koinen eunomian, pooo dokeite cheironos axiothesetai pimorias ho aneu
   episkopou ti poiein proairoumenos; etc., hierosune gar esti to panton
   agathon en anthropois anabebekos. How well this suits the doctrine of
   Peter and Paul the reader will easily discern. Cæsar or the king is,
   upon all accounts, thrust behind the bishop, who is said to be
   consecrated to God for the salvation of the world; him he is exhorted
   to obey; -- and in express opposition to the Holy Ghost, the bishop's
   name is thrust in between God and the king, as in a way of pre-eminence
   above the latter; and to do any thing without the bishop is made a far
   greater crime than to rise up against the king. As this seems scarce to
   be the language of one going upon an accusation to appear before the
   emperor, so I am certain it is most remote from the likeness of any
   thing that in this affair we are instructed in from the Scripture.
   Plainly this language is the same with that of the false impostor,
   Pseudo-Clemens, in his pretended Apostolical Constitutions. At this
   rate, or somewhat beyond it, have you him ranting: Lib. ii. cap. ii.,
   Episkopon Theou tupon echein en anthropois, ton panton archein
   anthropon, hiereon, basileon, archonton, pateron, huion, didaskalon kai
   panton homou ton hupekoon; -- "All popes, all sorts of persons
   whatever, priests, kings, and princes, fathers and children, all under
   the feet of this exemplar of God and ruler of men!" a passage which,
   doubtless, eminently interprets and illustrates that place of Peter, 1
   Epist. v. 1-3, "The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an
   elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
   of the glory that shall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is
   among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but
   willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being
   lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock." But yet,
   as if the man were stark mad with worldly pride and pomp, he afterward,
   in the name of the holy apostles of Jesus Christ, commands all the
   laity (forsooth) to honour, love, and fear the bishop hos kurion, hos
   despoten, hos archierea Theou, lib. ii. cap. xx. And that you may see
   whither the man drives, and what he aims at, after he hath set out his
   bishop like an emperor or an eastern king, in all pomp and glory, he
   adds, Tous episkopous archontas humon kai basileas hegeisthai nomizete,
   kai dasmous hos basileusi prospherete. The paying of tribute to them as
   kings is the issue of these descriptions, that they may have
   wherewithal to maintain their pomp and greatness, according to the
   institution of our Lord Jesus Christ and his blessed apostles! But I
   shall not rake farther into this dunghill, nor shall I add any more
   instances of this kind out of Ignatius, but close in one insisted on by
   our doctor for the proof of his episcopacy. Dissert. ii. cap. xxv. 7,
   saith he, Quartò, To episkopo, prsoechete, hina kai ho Theos humin.
   "Episcopo attendite, ut et vobis Deus attendat. Ego animam meam
   libenter eorum loco substitui cuperem quod Anglice optic dicimus" (my
   soul for theirs), "qui episcopo, presbyteris, et diaconis obsequuntur."
   I hope I may without great difficulty obtain the doctor's pardon, that
   I dare not be so bold with my soul as to jeopard it in that manner,
   especially being not mine own to dispose of.

   Upon these and many more the like accounts do the epistles seem to me
   to be like the children that the Jews had by their strange wives, Neh.
   xiii. 23, 24, who spake part the language of Ashdod, and part the
   language of the Jews. As there are in them many footsteps of a gracious
   spirit, every way worthy of and becoming the great and holy personage
   whose they are esteemed, so there is evidently a mixture of the working
   of that worldly and carnal spirit which in his days was not so let
   loose as in after times. For what is there in the Scripture, what is in
   the genuine epistle of Clemens, that gives countenance to those
   descriptions of episcopacy, bishops, and the subjection to them, that
   are in these epistles (as now we have them) so insisted on? what titles
   are given to bishops? what sovereignty, power, rule, dominion, is
   ascribed to them? Is there any thing of the like nature in the writings
   of the apostles? in Clemens? the epistle of Polycarp, etc., or in any
   unquestionable legitimate offspring of any of the first worthies of
   Christianity? Whence have they their three orders of bishops,
   presbyters, and deacons, upon the distinct observation of which so much
   weight is laid? Is there any one word, iota, tittle, or syllable, in
   the whole book of God, giving countenance to any such distinctions?
   Eph. iv. 11, we have "pastors and teachers." Rom. xii. 7, 8, "Him that
   teacheth, him that exhorteth, him that ruleth, and him that showeth
   mercy." Phil. i. 1, we have "bishops and deacons;" and their
   institution, with the order of it, we have at large expressed, 1 Tim.
   iii. 1-13, -- "Bishops and deacons," without the interposition of any
   other order whatever. Deacons we have appointed, Acts vi. 1-6; and
   elders, Acts xiv. 23. Those who are bishops we find called presbyters,
   Titus i. 5, 7; and those who are presbyters we find termed bishops,
   Acts xx. 28: so that deacons we know, and bishops who are presbyters,
   or presbyters who are bishops, we know; but bishops, presbyters, and
   deacons, as three distinct orders in the church, from the Scripture we
   know not. Neither did Clemens, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, know
   of any more than we do, which a few instances will manifest. Saith he,
   speaking of the apostles, Kata choras oun kai poleis kerussontes,
   kathistanon tas aparchas auton, dokimasantes to Pneumati, eis
   episkopous kai diakoonous ton mellonton pisteuen; kai touto ou kainos,
   ek gar de pollon chronon egegrapto peri episkopon kai diakonon, etc.
   Bishops and deacons (as in the church at Philippi) this man knows, but
   the third order he is utterly unacquainted withal. And that the
   difference of this man's expressions concerning church rulers from
   those in the epistle under consideration may the better appear, and
   that his asserting of bishops and presbyters to be one and the same may
   the more clearly be evidenced, shall transcribe one other passage from
   him, whose length I hope will be excused from the usefulness of it to
   the purpose in hand: Pages 57, 58, Kai hoi apostoloi hemon egnosan dia
   tou Kuriou hemon Iesou Christou, hoti eris estai epi tou onomatos tes
   episkopes; dia tauten oun ten aitian, prognosin eilephotes teleian,
   katestesan tous proeiremenous, kai metaxu epinomen dedokasin, hopos,
   ean koimethosin, diadexontai heteroi dedokimasmenoi andres, ten
   leitourgian auton. Tous oun katastathentas hup' ekeinon, e metaxu huph'
   heteron ellogimon andron, ouneudokesases tes ekklesias pases, (for so,
   it seems, was the manner of the church in his days, that their officers
   were appointed by the consent of the whole church,) kai leitourgesantas
   amemptos to poimnio tou Christou meta papeinophrosues, heouchos kai
   abanausos, memarturemenous te pollois chronois hupo panton, toutous ou
   dikaios nomizomen apobalesthai tes leitourgias; hamartia gar ou mikra
   hemin estai, ean tous amemptos kai hosios prosenenkontas ta dora tes
   episkopes apobalomen. Makarioi hoi proodoiporesantes presbuteroi (or
   the bishops of whom he was speaking), hoitines enkarpon kai teleian
   eschon ten analusin, etc. And sundry other discoveries are there in
   that epistle of the like nature. It is not my design or purpose to
   insist upon the parity of bishops and presbyters, or rather the
   identity of office, denoted by sundry appellations, from these and the
   like places; this work is done to the full by Blondellus, so that our
   labour in this kind, were that the purpose in hand, is prevented. He
   that thinks the arguments of that learned man to this purpose are
   indeed answered thoroughly and removed by Dr Hammond, in his fourth
   dissertation, where he proposes them to consideration, may one day
   think it needful to be able to distinguish between words and things.
   That Clemens owns in a church but two sorts of officers, the first
   whereof he calls sometimes bishops, sometimes presbyters, the other
   deacons, the doctor himself doth not deny.

   That in the judgment of Clemens no more were instituted in the church
   is no less evident. And this carries the conviction of its truth so
   clearly with it that Lombard himself confesseth, "Hos solos ministrorum
   duos ordines ecclesiam primitivam habuisse, et de his solis præceptum
   apostoli nos habere," lib. iv. Sen. D. 24. It seems, moreover, that
   those bishops and deacons in those days, as was observed, were
   appointed to the office by and with the consent of the people, or whole
   body of the church; no less do these words import, Suneudokesases tes
   ekklesias pases. Our doctor, indeed, renders these words, "Applaudente
   aut congratulante ecclesia tota;" and adds (satis pro imperio) "nihil
   hic de acceptatione totius ecclesiæ, sine qua episcopos et diaconos ab
   apostolis et apostolicis viris constitutos non esse, ex hoc loco
   concludit Blondellus, quasi, qui ex Dei jussu et approbatione
   constituebantur, populi etiam acceptatione indigere putandi essent,"
   Dissert. iv. cap. vii. 8, 10. And who dares take that confidence upon
   him as to affirm any more what so great a doctor hath denied! Though
   the scope of the place, the nature of the thing, and first most common
   sense of the word here used, be willingly to consent (as it is also
   used in the Scripture, for the most part, Acts viii. 1, 1 Cor. vii. 12)
   to a thing to be done, or to the doing of it, yet here it must be taken
   to applaud or congratulate, or what else our doctor pleases, because he
   will have it so. Ellogimoi andres, also, must be "viri apostolici," men
   with apostolical or extraordinary power, when they are only the choice
   men of the church where such a constitution of officers is had that are
   intended, because it is to our doctor's purpose to have the words so
   rendered. "Ex jussu Dei et approbatione" is added, as though any
   particular command or approbation of God were intimated for the
   constitution of the bishops and deacons mentioned, beyond the
   institution of the Lord Jesus Christ that elders should be ordained in
   every church; because this is, it seems, to be exclusive wholly of the
   consent of the people, as any way needful or required to their
   constitution; which yet, as it is practically false, no such thing
   being mentioned by Clemens, who recounteth the ways and means whereby
   officers were continued in the church even after the decease of the
   apostles and those first ordained by them to that holy employment, so
   also is it argumentatively weak and unconcluding. God appointed,
   designed Saul to be king, approving of his so being, and yet he would
   have the people come together to choose him: so also was it in the case
   of David. Though the apostles, in the name and by the authority of God,
   appointed the deacons of the church at Jerusalem, yet they would have
   the whole church look out among themselves the men to be appointed. And
   that the ordaining of the elders was with the people's election, Acts
   xiv. 23, it will ere long be manifested that neither our doctor nor any
   of his associates have as yet disproved. This poor thing "the people,"
   being the peculiar people of Christ, the heritage of God, and holy
   temple unto him, etc., will one day be found to be another manner of
   thing than many of our great doctors have supposed. But he informs us,
   cap. iv. sect. 3, from that testimony which we cited before, that the
   apostles in the appointment of bishops and deacons (for so the words
   expressly are) are said to Pneumati dokimasai, -- that is, saith he,
   "Revelationibus edoctos esse, quibus demum hæc dignitas communicanda
   esset;" that is, that they appointed those whom God revealed to them in
   an extraordinary manner to be so ordained, and this is the meaning of
   to Pneumati dokimasantes. And why so? The Holy Ghost orders concerning
   the appointment of deacons dokimazesthosan proton, 1 Tim. iii. 10. That
   those who are to be taken into office and power in the church had need
   first to be tried and approved is granted, and this work the apostles
   give to the multitude of the church, Acts vi. 3; -- where yet, after
   the people's election, and the apostles' approbation, and the trial by
   both, one that was chosen is supposed to have proved none of the best;
   and yet of him and them are the apostles said by Clemens that they did
   to Pneumati dokimasai. But how shall it be made to appear that "Spiritu
   probantes," trying or proving by the Spirit, or spiritually proving
   them, to try whether they were able ministers of the new testament, not
   of the letter but of the Spirit, proving them by that Spirit; which was
   promised unto them "to lead them into all truth," must needs signify
   they were taught whom they should appoint by immediate revelation? To
   prove by the Spirit, or spiritually, the persons that are to be made
   ministers or bishops, is to have their names revealed to us! Stephen is
   said to speak en to Pneumati, Acts vi. 10; and Paul purposed en to
   Pneumati, Acts xix. 21; and we are said to serve God en to Pneumati,
   Gal. v. 5; and to make supplication en to Pneumati, Eph. vi. 18; with
   many more expressions of the like nature. Does all this relate to
   immediate revelation, and are all things done thereby which we are said
   to do in the Spirit? Before we were instructed in this mystery, and
   were informed that dokimasantes to Pneumati did signify to be "taught
   by revelation," we had thought that the expression of doing any thing
   to Pneumati had manifested the assistance, guidance, and direction,
   which for the doing it we receive by the holy and blessed Spirit of
   God, promised unto us, and bestowed on, in, and through the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Yea, but he adds that it is also spoken of the apostles,
   prognosin præcognitionem, that is, revelationem eilephotes teleian,
   they appointed them bishops and deacons; by the help and presence of
   the Spirit with them the apostles examined and tried those who were to
   be appointed bishops, so obtaining and receiving a perfect
   foreknowledge, or knowledge of them before their admission into office.
   This also expresses revelation (prognosin eilephotes), upon trial it
   was revealed unto them! and so must any thing else be allowed to be
   that our doctor will have to be so, now he is asserting to that
   purpose. But had the ellogimoi andres who appointed bishops and deacons
   after the apostles' time, had they also this special revelation? or may
   they not be said dokimasai to Pneumati? If not, how will you look upon
   them under the notion of ellogimon andron who neglected so great a
   duty? If they did, let us know when this way of constituting church
   officers by immediate revelation ceased, and what was afterward taken
   up in the room thereof, and who they were that first proceeded on
   another account, and on what authority they did so. There is a
   generation of men in the world which will thank the doctor for this
   insinuation, and will tie knots upon it that will trouble him to loose.

   Before we return, let us look but a little farther, and we shall have a
   little more light given us into what was the condition and power of the
   people in the church in the days of Clemens. Speaking of them who
   occasioned the division and schism in the church of Corinth, or them
   about whose exaltation into office, or dejection from it, that sad
   difference fell out, he gives them this advice: Tis oun en humin
   gennaios? tis eusplanchnos? tis pepleromenos agapes? eipato; Ei di' eme
   stasis, kai eris, kai schismata, ekchoro apeimi hou ean boulesthe, kai
   poio ta prostassomena hupo tou plethous; monon to poimnion tou Christou
   eireneueto, meta ton kathestamenon presbuteron. It seems the plethos,
   the multitude, or the people, were not such poor, inconsiderable things
   as they are reported to be, when he advises them to stop and stay the
   sedition, by yielding obedience to the things by them appointed and
   commanded. If it were in itself evil, disorderly, and not according to
   the mind of Christ, that the people should order and appoint things in
   the church, it had been simply evil for Clemens to have advised any to
   yield obedience unto things by them so appointed. Where is now
   Ignatius' hupotassesthe to episkoto and choris episkopou, etc.? Even
   those who are contending about rule and government in the church are
   advised to stand to the determination of the people, and to cry, Ta
   prostassomena hupo tou plethous poioumen. This is also insisted on by
   Blondellus, who thence argues "potestatem plebis circa sacra." Dissert.
   v. cap. viii. sect. 4, "Ad verba hæc," saith our doctor, "prodigii
   instar est quod notandum duxit Dav. Blondellus potestatem plebis circa
   sacra (de qua tandem integram dissertationem elucubravit) artificiis
   quibuscunque asserturus. Hic (inquit) nos monet Clemens fideles etiam
   de episeopatu aut presbyterio contendentes, non ab episcopi singulari
   kai huperechontos nutu, sed a multitudinis præceptis pependisse." But
   let not our doctor be angry, nor cry out so fast of prodigies; a little
   time will manifest that many things may not be prodigious, which yet
   are contrary to sundry of his conceptions and apprehensions. I cannot
   but acknowledge him to be provoked; but withal must say, that I have
   found very commonly that reasons ushered in by such loud clamours have,
   on examination, proved to have stood in need of some such noises as
   might fright men from the consideration of them. What is in the next
   sections set up to shield the children of episcopacy from being
   affrighted with this prodigy may perhaps be of more efficacy thereunto
   than the exclamations before mentioned; he therefore proceeds, sect. 5.
   "Certe," saith he, "si serio rem ageret Dav. Blondellus de presbyteris
   suis (non de episcopis nostris) actum plane et triumphatum erit, nec
   enim ab universo aliquo presbyterorum collegio, quod ille tam afflictim
   ardet, sed a multitudinis solius arbitrio, tum contendentes de
   episcopo, tum fideles omnes Corinthios pependisse æque concludendum
   erit." If any man in the world hath manifested more desperate affection
   towards presbytery than this doctor hath done towards episcopacy, for
   my part solus habeto. But though neither Clemens nor Blondellus speaks
   any one word about the ordering of things "multitudinis solius
   arbitrio," yet here is that said by them both which is sufficiently
   destructive, not only to the episcopacy the doctor contends for, as a
   thing wholly inconsistent with the power and liberty here granted the
   people, but of any such presbytery also as shall undertake the ordering
   and disposing of things in the church of God without the consent and
   concurrent suffrage of the people. Such a presbytery, it seems,
   Blondellus does not defend. But yet neither the doctor's outcry as at a
   prodigy, nor this retortion upon presbytery is any answer to the
   testimony of Clemens, nor, indeed, is there the least possible
   reflection upon an orderly gospel presbytery in any church and over it
   by what Clemens here professeth to be the power of the people; all the
   appearance of any such thing is from the term "solius," foisted into
   the discourse of Blondellus by the doctor, in his taking of it up to
   retort at. Clemens in the very next words secures us from any thought
   that all things depended "a multitudinis solius arbitrio." His very
   next words are, Monon to poimnoin tou Christou eireneueto, meta ton
   kathestamenon presbuteron. Our doctors and masters (having stuffed
   their imaginations with the shape and lineament of that hierarchical
   fabric which the craft, policy, subtlety, avarice, pride, and ambition,
   of many ages successively had formed and framed according to the
   pattern they saw in the mount of the world and the governments
   therein), upon the first hearing of a church, a flock of Christ,
   walking in orderly subjection to their own elders, concurring with them
   and consenting to them in their rule and government, instantly, as men
   amazed, cry out, "A prodigy!" It is not imaginable into what
   ridiculous, contemptible miscarriages, pride, prejudice, and
   self-fulness, do oftentimes betray men, otherwise of good abilities in
   their ways and very commendable industry.

   But, sect. 6, the doctor comes closer, and gives his reason why this
   testimony of Clemens is not of any efficacy to the purpose in hand.
   Saith he, "At quis (sodes) a fidelibus de episcopatu (ut vis) contra
   ipsos ab apostolis constitutos episcopos contendentibus; quis a populo
   contra principem suum tumultus ciente; quis verbis ad retundendum
   seditionem ad plebem factis, argumenta ad authoritatem populo
   adjudicandum, principi derogandum duci posse existimavit?" Though many
   words follow in the next section, yet this is all of answer that is
   given to this signal testimony of Clemens. I know the doctor, for the
   most part, meets not only with favourable readers, but also partial
   admirers, or else, certainly, his exclamation would scarce pass for an
   invincible argument, nor such rhetorical diversions as this be esteemed
   solid answers. There is not by Blondellus any argument taken from the
   faithful's tumultuating against the bishops (that "If appointed by the
   apostles," which is thrust in, taken for the persons of those bishops,
   is against the express testimony of Clemens in this epistle), nor from
   the people's seditiously rebelling against their prince, nor from any
   word spoken to the people to repress their sedition; neither was any
   thing of this nature urged in the least by Blondellus; nor is there any
   colour given to such a collection from any thing in the words cited
   from the epistle or the context of them. It is the advice of the church
   of Rome to the persons (whether already in office or aspiring
   thereunto) about whom the contention and division was in the church of
   Corinth that is insisted on. It is not the words or plea of them who
   were in disorder. There is not any reprehension given to the body of
   the church, the multitude, or people, who are supposed to tumultuate,
   to quiet them, but a direction given, as was said, by the church of
   Rome to the persons that occasioned the difference, how to behave
   themselves, so that a timely issue might be put to the division of the
   church. To this end are they advised to observe the prostagmata, the
   orders, precepts, decrees, or appointments, of "the multitude," as,
   from Acts xv. 12, the body of the church is called. It is not that they
   should yield to their tumultuating, but yield obedience to their
   orderly precepts. Ta prostassomena hupo tou plethous are by him
   approved; and had it not been lawful for them with the presbyters
   prostattein in the affairs of the church, Clemens, writing this epistle
   the whole church, could not possibly have led them into a greater
   snare.

   It is a sad thing to consider the pitiful entanglements and snares that
   some men run into, who will undertake to make good what they have once
   engaged for, let what will come against them.

   To return, then: it is evident that in the time of Clemens there were
   but two sorts of officers in the church, bishops and deacons; whereas
   the epistles of Ignatius do precisely, in every place where any mention
   is made of them (as there is upon occasions and upon none at all),
   insist on three orders, distinct in name and things. With Clemens it is
   not so. Those whom he calls bishops in one place, the very same persons
   he immediately calls presbyters, after the example of Paul, Acts xx.
   28, Titus i. 5, 7, and plainly asserts episcopacy to be the office of
   presbyters. Hamartia, saith he, ou mikra hemin estai ean tous amemptos
   kai hosios prosenenkontas ta dora tes episkopes apozalomen. Makarioi
   hoi proodoiporesantes presbuteroi, -- namely, because they were in no
   danger to be cast from their episcopacy. And whereas the fault which he
   reproves in the church of Corinth is their division, and want of due
   subjection to their spiritual governors, according to the order which
   Christ hath appointed in all the churches of the saints, he affirms
   plainly that those governors were the presbyters of the church:
   Aischra, saith he, kai lian aischra, kai anaxia tes en Kristo agoges
   akouetai, ten bebaiotaten, kai archaian Korinthion ekklesian, di' hen e
   duo prosopa, stasiazein pros tous presbuterous. And in all places
   throughout the whole epistle, writing ekklesia tou Theou paroikouse
   Korinthon, that particular church of Corinth, the saints dwelling
   there, walking in the order and fellowship of the gospel, where he
   treats of those things, he still intimates a plurality of presbyters in
   the church (as there may, nay, there ought to be, in every single
   congregation, Acts xx. 28), without the least intimation of any
   singular person promoted, upon any account whatever, above his fellows.
   So in the advice given to the persons who occasioned the division
   before mentioned, Monon to poimnion tou Christou eireneueto meta ton
   kathistamenon presbuteron. Had there been a singular bishop at Corinth,
   much more a metropolitan, such as our doctor speaks him to have been,
   it had been impossible that he should be thus passed by in silence.

   But the doctor gives you a double answer to this observation, with the
   several parts whereof I doubt not but that he makes himself merry, if
   he can suppose that any men are so wedded to his dictates as to give
   them entertainment; for indeed they are plainly jocular. But learned
   men must have leave sometimes to exercise their fancies, and to sport
   themselves with their own imaginations.

   First, then, for the mention that is made of many presbyters in the
   church of Corinth, to whom Clemens, in the name of the church of Rome,
   exhorts to give all due respect, honour, obedience: He tells you that
   by "The church of Corinth," all the churches of Achaia are meant and
   intended. The epistle is directed only Te ekklesia tou Theou paroikouse
   Korinthon, without the least intimation of any other church or
   churches. The difference it is written about was occasioned by one or
   two persons in that church only; it is that church alone that is
   exhorted to order and due subjection to their elders. From the
   beginning to the end of the epistle, there is not one word, apex, or
   tittle, to intimate the designation of it to any church or churches
   beyond the single church of Corinth, or that they had any concernment
   in the difference spoken to. The fabric of after ages ties so close to
   the doctor's imagination that there is no entrance for the true frame
   of the primitive church of Christ; and therefore every thing must be
   wrested and apportioned to the conceit of such an episcopacy as he hath
   entertained. Whereas he ought to crop off both head and heels of his
   own imagination, and the episcopacy of the latter days, which he too
   dearly affects, he chooseth rather to stretch and torture the ancient
   government of the church, that it may seem to answer the frame
   presently contended for. But let us a little attend to the doctor's
   learned argument, whereby he endeavours to make good his assertion:--

   1. He tells you that Corinth was the chief city of Achaia, the
   metropolis (in a political sense and acceptation of the word) of
   Greece, where the proconsul had his residence, Dissert. v. cap. ii.
   sect. 3. Let us grant this to our learned doctor, lest we should find
   nothing to gratify him withal; what then will follow? Hence, saith he,
   it will follow, sect. 4, that this epistle which was sent, "Ecclesiæ
   paroikouse Korinthon, non ad unius civitatis ecclesiam, sed ad omnes
   totius Achaiæ Christianos, per singulas civitates et regiones, sub
   episcopis aut præfectis suis ubique collocatas missa existimetur." But
   pray, doctor, why so? We poor creatures, who are not so sharp-sighted
   as to discern a metropolitan archbishop at Corinth, on whom all the
   bishops in Greece were dependent, nor can find any instituted church in
   the Scripture or in Clemens of one denomination beyond a single
   congregation, cannot but think that all the strength of this
   consectary, from the insinuation of such a state of things in the
   church God, is nothing but a pure begging of the thing in question,
   which will never be granted upon such terms.

   Yea, but he adds, sect. 5, that "Paul wrote his epistle not only to the
   church of Corinth, but also to all the churches of Achaia; therefore
   Clemens did so also." At first view this argument seems not very
   conclusive, yea, appears, indeed, very ridiculous. The enforcement of
   it which ensues may perhaps give new life and vigour to it. How, then,
   is it proved that Paul wrote not only to the church of Corinth, but to
   all them in Achaia also? Why, saith he, in the second epistle, chap. i.
   verse 1, it is so expressed. He writes, Te ekklesia tou Theou te ouse
   en Korintho, sun tois hagiois pasi tois ousin en hole te Achaia. Very
   good. It is indisputably evident that Paul wrote his second epistle to
   the church at Corinth and all the rest of Achaia, for he expressly
   affirms himself so to do; and for the first epistle, it is directed not
   only to the church of Corinth, chap. i., verse 2, but also pasi tois
   epikaloumenois to onoma tou Kuriou hemon Iesou Christou en panti topo
   -- that is, saith our doctor, in the whole region of Achaia! So,
   indeed, says the doctor's great friend, Grotius, to whom he is beholden
   for more than one rare notion. I say it not in any way of any reproach
   to the doctor, only I cannot but think his careful warding of himself
   against the thoughts of men that he should be beholden to Grotius doth
   exceedingly unbecome the doctor's gravity and self-denial. This is
   complained of by some who have tried it in reference to his late
   comment on the Revelation. And in this Dissertation he is put by his
   own thoughts (I will not say guilty) to an apology, cap. i. sect. 24:
   "Qua in re suffragium suum tulisse Hugonem Grotium ton panu ex
   annotationibus posthumis, nuper editis, et postquam hæc omnia
   typographo transcripta essent, cursim perlectis edoctum gratulor." Let
   not the reader think that Dr Hammond had transmitted his papers full of
   rare conjectures to the printer before Grotius' Annotations upon the
   Revelation were published, but only before he had read them. The doctor
   little thinks what a fly this is in his pot of ointment, nor how
   indecent with all impartial men such apologies, subservient to a frame
   of spirit in bondage to a man's own esteem and reputation, appear to
   be. But let this pass, and let the saints that call upon the name of
   Jesus Christ in every place be the saints in every part of Achaia, --
   though the epistle itself (written, indeed, upon occasion taken from
   the church of Corinth, yet) was given by inspiration from God for the
   use not only of all the saints in the whole world at that time wherein
   it was written, but of all those who were to believe in any part or
   place of the world to the end thereof, -- although the assertion of it
   be not built on any tolerable conjecture, but may be rejected with the
   same facility wherewith it is tendered, what now will hence ensue? Why,
   hence it follows that Clemens also wrote his epistle to all the
   churches in Achaia. Very good! Paul writing an epistle entitled chiefly
   to the Corinthians, expressly and rhetos directs it to the saints or
   churches of Achaia, yea, to all that call upon the name of God in every
   place, so that his epistle, being of catholic concernment, is not to be
   confined to the church of Corinth only, although most of the particular
   things mentioned in that epistle related only to that particular
   church; therefore, Clemens directing his epistle to the church of
   Corinth only, not once mentioning nor insinuating an intention of
   extending it to any other, handling in it only the peculiar concernment
   of that church, and a difference about one or two persons therein, must
   be supposed to have written to all the churches of Achaia! And if such
   arguments as these will not prove episcopacy to be of apostolical
   constitution, what will prevail with men so to esteem it! --


   ? "Si Pergama dextrâ

   Defendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent."

   Æn. ii. 291, 292.

   And this is the cause of naming many elders or presbyters in one
   church! For my part, I suppose the doctor might more probably have
   adhered to a former conjecture of his, Dissert. iv. cap. x. sect. 9.
   Concerning two sundry different churches, where were distinct officers,
   in the same city, "Primo," saith he, "respondeo non usque quaque verum
   est, quod pro concesso sumitur, quamvis enim in una ecclesia aut cætu
   plures simul episcopi nunquam fuerint" (pray except them mentioned Acts
   xx. 28, and those Acts xiv. 23), "nihil tamen obstare quin in eadem
   civitate duo aliquando cætus disterminati fuerint." He might, I say,
   with more show of probability have abode by this observation than to
   have rambled over all Greece to relieve himself against his
   adversaries. But yet neither would this suffice. What use may or will
   be made of this concession shall elsewhere be manifested.

   But the doctor hath yet another answer to this multiplication of
   elders, and the mention of them with deacons, with the evident identity
   that is between them and bishops through the whole epistle, the same
   persons being unquestionably intended, in respect of the same office,
   by both these appellations. Now, this second answer is founded upon the
   supposition of the former (a goodly foundation!) -- namely, that the
   epistle under consideration was written and sent not to the church of
   Corinth only, but to all the churches of Achaia, of which Corinth was
   the metropolitan.

   2. Now, this second answer is, that the elders or presbyters here
   mentioned were properly those whom he calls bishops, diocesans, -- men
   of a third rank and order, above deacons and presbyters in the church
   administrations and government; and for those who are properly called
   presbyters, there were then none in the church. To give colour to this
   miserable evasion, Dissert. iv. cap. x. sect. 11, he discourseth about
   the government and ordering of church affairs by bishops and deacons in
   some churches that were small, not yet formed or completed, nor come to
   perfection at the first planting of them. How well this is accommodated
   to the church of Corinth, which Clemens calls bebaiotaten kai archaian,
   and which himself would have to be a metropolitical church, being
   confessedly great, numerous, furnished with great and large gifts and
   abilities, may be seen with half an eye. How ill, also, this shift is
   accommodated to help in the case for whose service it was first
   invented, is no less evident. It was to save the sword of Phil. i. 1
   from the throat of the episcopacy he contendeth for. That epistle is
   directed to the saints or church at Philippi, with the bishops and
   deacons. Two things do here trouble our doctor:-- (1.) The mention of
   more bishops than one at Philippi; (2.) The knitting together of
   bishops and deacons, as the only two orders in the church, bringing
   down episcopacy one degree at least from that height whereto he would
   exalt it. For the first of these, he tells you that Philippi was the
   metropolitan church of the province of Macedonia; that the rest of the
   churches, which had every one their several bishops (diocesan we must
   suppose), were all comprised in the mentioning of Philippi: so that
   though the epistle be precisely directed tois hagiois tois ousin en
   Philippois, yet the bishops that were with them must be supposed to be
   bishops of the whole province of Macedonia, because the church of
   Philippi was the metropolitan. The whole country must have been
   supposed to be converted, (and who that knows any thing of antiquity
   will dispute that!) and so divided with diocesans, as England of late
   was, the archbishop's see being at Philippi. But how came it then to
   pass that there is mention made of bishops and deacons only, without
   any one word of a third order, or rank of men distinct from them,
   called presbyters or elders? To this he answers, secondly, that when
   the church was first planed, before any great number was converts, or
   any fit to be made presbyters, there were only those two orders
   instituted, bishops and deacons: so that this church at Philippi seems
   to have been a metropolitical infant! The truth is, if ever the doctor
   be put upon reconciling the contradictions of his answers one to
   another, not only in this, but almost in every particular he deals
   withal (an entanglement which he is thrown into by his bold and
   groundless conjectures), he will find it to be as endless as fruitless;
   but it is not my present business to interpose in his quarrels, either
   with himself or presbytery. As to the matter under consideration, I
   desire only to be resolved in these few queries:--

   1. If there were in the times of Clemens no presbyters in the churches,
   not [even] in so great and flourishing a church as that of Corinth, and
   if all the places in the Scripture where there is mention of elders do
   precisely intend bishops, in a distinction from them who are only
   deacons and not bishops also, as he asserts, when, by whom, and by what
   authority, were elders who are only so, inferior to bishops peculiarly
   so termed, instituted and appointed in the churches? And how comes it
   to pass that there is such express mention made of the office of
   deacons, and the continuance of it, -- none at all of elders, who are
   acknowledged to be superior to them, and on whose shoulders in all
   their own churches lies the great weight and burden of all
   ecclesiastical administrations? As we say of their bishops, so shall we
   of any presbyters not instituted and appointed by the authority of
   Jesus Christ in the church, "Let them go to the place from whence they
   came."

   2. I desire the doctor to inform me in what sense he would have me to
   understand him, Dissert. ii. cap. xxix. sect. 21, 22, where he disputes
   that these words of Jerome, "Antequam studia in religione fierent, et
   diceretur in populis, ego sum Pauli, ego Cephæ, communi presbyterorum
   consensu ecclesiæ gubernabantur," are to be understood of the times of
   the apostles, when the first schism was in the church of Corinth, when
   it seems that neither then nor a good while after was there any such
   thing as presbyters in the church of Corinth, nor in any other church
   as we can hear of; as also, to tell us whether all those presbyters
   were bishops properly so called, distinct from elders who are only so,
   out of whom one man is chosen to be a bishop properly so called. To
   these inquiries I shall only add, --

   3. That whereas in the Scripture we find clearly but two sorts of
   church-officers mentioned, as also in this epistle of Clemens, the
   third, that was afterward introduced, be it what it will, or fall on
   whom it will, that we oppose. This, saith the doctor, is that of
   presbytery. Give us churches instituted according to the word of
   Christ; give us in every church bishops and deacons (rather than we
   will quarrel, give us a bishop and deacons); let those bishops attend
   the particular flock over which they are appointed, preaching the word
   and administering the holy ordinances of the gospel in and to their own
   flock, -- and I dare undertake for all the contenders for presbytery in
   this nation, and much more for the Independents, that there shall be an
   end of this quarrel; that they will not strive with the doctor, nor any
   living, for the introduction of any third sort of persons (though they
   should be called presbyters) into church office and government. Only
   this I must add, that the Scripture more frequently terms this second
   sort of men elders and presbyters than it doth bishops; and that word
   having been appropriated to a third sort peculiarly, we desire leave of
   the doctor and his associates if we also most frequently call them so,
   no ways declining the other appellation of bishops, so that it may be
   applied to signify the second, and not a third, rank of men. But of
   this whole business, with the nature, constitution, and frame, of the
   first churches, and the sad mistakes that men have, by their own
   prejudices, been engaged into in their delineation of them, a fuller
   opportunity, if God will, may ere long be afforded.

   To return, then, to our Ignatius: Even upon this consideration of the
   difference that is between the epistles ascribed to him and the
   writings of one of the same time with him, or not long before him, as
   to their language and expression about church order and officers, it is
   evident that there hath been ill-favoured tampering with them, by them
   who thought to avail themselves of his authority for the asserting of
   that which never came into his mind.

   As I intimated before, I have not insisted on any of those things, nor
   do on them altogether, with the like that may be added, as a sufficient
   foundation for the total rejection of those epistles which go under the
   name of Ignatius. There is in some of them a sweet and gracious spirit
   of faith, love, holiness, zeal for God, becoming so excellent and holy
   a witness of Christ as he was, evidently breathing and working. Neither
   is there any need at all that, for the defence of our hypothesis
   concerning the non-institution of any church-officer whatever relating
   to more churches in his office, or any other church, than a single
   particular congregation, we should so reject them; for although many
   passages usually insisted on, and carefully collected by Dr Hammond for
   the proof of such an episcopacy to have been received by them of old as
   is now contended for, are exceedingly remote from the way and manner of
   the expression of those things used by the divine writers, with them
   also that followed after, both before, as hath been manifested, and
   some while after the days of Ignatius, as might be farther clearly
   evinced, and are thrust into the series of the discourse with such an
   incoherent impertinency as proclaims an interpolation, being some of
   them also very ridiculous, and so foolishly hyperbolical that they fall
   very little short of blasphemies, yet there are expressions in all or
   most of them that will abundantly manifest that he who was their author
   (whoever he was) never dreamt of any such fabric of church-order as in
   after ages was insensibly reared. Men who are full of their own
   apprehensions, begotten in them by such representations of things as
   either their desired presence hath exhibited to their mind or any
   after-prejudicate presumption hath possessed them with, are apt, upon
   the least appearance of any likeness unto that church they fancy, to
   imagine that they see the face and all the lineaments thereof, when,
   upon due examination, it will be easily discovered that there is not
   indeed the least resemblance between what they find in, and what they
   bring to, the authors in and of whom they make their inquiry. The
   Papists, having hatched and owned by several degrees that monstrous
   figment of transubstantiation (to instance among many in that
   abomination), -- a folly destructive to whatever is in us as being
   living creatures, men, or Christians, or whatever by sense, reason, or
   religion, we are furnished withal, offering violence to us in what we
   hear, in what we see with our eyes and look upon, in what our hands do
   handle, and our palates taste, breaking in upon our understandings with
   vagrant, flying forms, self-subsisting accidents, with as many express
   contradictions on sundry accounts as the nature of things is capable of
   relation unto, attended with more gross idolatry than that of the poor
   naked Indians who fall down and worship a piece of red cloth, or of
   those who first adore their gods and then correct them, -- do yet upon
   the discovery of any expressions among the ancients which they now make
   use of quite to another end and purpose than they did who first
   ventured upon them, having minds filled with their own abominations,
   presently cry out and triumph, as if they had found the whole fardel of
   the mass in its perfect dress, and their breaden god in the midst of
   it. It is no otherwise in the case of episcopacy. Men of these latter
   generations, from what they saw in present being, and that usefulness
   of it to all their desires and interests, having entertained thoughts
   of love to it and delight in it, searching antiquity, not to instruct
   them in the truth, but to establish their prejudicate opinion received
   by tradition from their fathers, and to consult them with whom they
   have to do, whatever expressions they find or can hear of that fall in,
   as to the sound of words, with what is now insisted upon, instantly
   they cry out, "Vicimus Io Pæan!" What a simple generation of Presbyters
   and Independents have we, that are ignorant of all antiquity, or do not
   understand what they read and look upon! Hence, if we will not believe
   that in Ignatius' days there were many parish churches, with their
   single priests, in subordination to a diocesan bishop, either
   immediately or by the interposed power of a chore-episcopus, and the
   like; and those diocesans, again, in the precincts of provinces, laid
   in a due subjection to their metropolitans, who took care of them as
   they of their parish priests; every individual church having no officer
   but a presbyter; every diocesan church having no presbyter, but a
   bishop; and every metropolitan church having neither presbyter nor
   bishop properly related unto it as such, but an archbishop, -- we are
   worse than infidels! Truly I cannot but wonder whether it doth not
   sometimes enter into these men's thoughts to apprehend how contemptible
   they are in their proofs for the fathering of such an ecclesiastical
   distribution of governors and government, as undeniably lackeyed after
   the civil divisions and constitutions of the times and places wherein
   it was introduced, upon those holy persons, whose souls never once
   entered into the secrets thereof.

   Thus fares it with our doctor and his Ignatius: Ouk iden, all' edokesen
   idein dia nukta selenen. I shall only crave leave to say to him as
   Augustus of Quintilius Varus, upon the loss of his legions in Germany
   under his command, "Quintili Vare, redde legiones. Domine doctor, redde
   ecclesias." Give us the churches of Christ, such as they were in the
   days of the apostles, and down to Ignatius, though before that time (if
   Hegesippus may be believed) somewhat defloured, and our contest about
   church officers and government will be nearer at an end than perhaps
   you will readily imagine. Give us a church all whose members are holy,
   called, sanctified, justified, living stones, temples for the Holy
   Ghost, saints, believers, united to Christ the head by the Spirit that
   is given to them and dwelleth in them; a church whose plethos is hopou
   an phane ho episkopos that doth nothing by its members apart, that
   appertains to church-order, but when it is gathered epi to auto; a
   church that being so gathered together in one place, spoudazei panta
   prassein en homonoia Theou, prokathemenou tou episkopou, acting in
   church things, in its whole body, under the rule and presidence of its
   officers; a church walking in order, and not as some, who episkopon men

   hoi toioutoi ouk eusuneidetoi men einai phainontai, dia men to me
   bebaios kat' entolen sunathroizesthai, such as calling the bishop to
   the assemblies, yet do all things without him, -- the manner of some in
   our days, -- he supposeth not to keep the assemblies according to the
   command of Christ); -- give us, I say, such a church, and let us come
   to them when they are pantes epi to auto, en te proseuche hama
   sunachthentes, such as the churches in the days of Ignatius appear to
   have been, and are so rendered in the quotations taken from his
   epistles by the learned doctor for the confirmation of episcopacy, and,
   as I said before, the contest of this present digression will quickly
   draw to an issue. Being unwilling to go too far out of my way, I shall
   not, --

   1. Consider the severals instanced in for the proof of episcopacy by
   the doctor. Seeing undeniably the interpretation must follow and be
   proportioned by the general issue of that state of the church in the
   days wherein those epistles were writ, or are pretended so to be, if
   that appear to be such as I have mentioned, I presume the doctor
   himself will confess that his witnesses speak not one word to his
   business, for whose confirmation he doth produce them. Nor, --

   2. Shall I insist upon the degeneration of the institutions and
   appointments of Jesus Christ concerning church administrations, in the
   management of the succeeding churches, as principled and spirited by
   the operative and efficacious mystery of iniquity, occasioned and
   advantaged by the accommodation of ecclesiastical affairs to the civil
   distributions and merits of the political state of things in those
   days. Nor, --

   3. Insist much farther on the exceeding dissimilitude and unconformity
   that is between the expressions concerning church officers and affairs
   in these epistles (whencesoever they come), and those in the writings
   of unquestionable credit immediately before and after them, as also the
   utter silence of the Scripture in those things wherewith they so
   abound. The Epistle of Clemens, of which mention was made before, was
   written for the composing and quieting of a division and distemper that
   was fallen out in the church of Corinth. Of the cause of that
   dissension that then miserably rent that congregation, he informs us in
   that complaint that some ou dikaios appobalesthai tes leitourgias, were
   wrongfully cast from the ministry by the multitude: and he tells you
   that these were good, honest men, and faithful in the discharge of
   their duty; for saith he, Horomen hoti enious humeis metegagete, kalos
   politeuomenous, ek tes amemptos autois tetimemenes leitourgias, though
   they were unblamable both in their conversation and ministry, yet they
   removed them from their office. To reprove this evil, to convince them
   of the sinfulness of it, to reduce them to a right understanding of
   their duty and order, walking in the fellowship of the gospel, what
   course doth he proceed in? what arguments doth he use? He minds them of
   one God, one Christ, one body, one faith; tells them that wicked men
   alone use such ways and practices; bids them read the epistle of Paul,
   formerly written to them upon occasion of another division, and to be
   subject to their own elders, and all of them to leave off contending,
   quietly doing the things which the people, or the body of the church,
   delivered and commanded. Now, had this person, writing on this
   occasion, using all sorts of arguments, artificial or inartificial, for
   his purpose, been baptized into the opinion and esteem of a single
   episcopal superintendent, -- whose exaltation seems to be the design of
   much which is said in the epistles of Ignatius, in the sense wherein
   his words are usually taken, -- and yet never once so much as bid them
   be subject to the bishop, that "resemblance of God the Father,
   supplying of the place of Christ," nor told them how terrible a thing
   it was to disobey trim, nor pawned his soul for theirs that should
   submit to him, that all that obeyed him were safe, all that disobeyed
   him were rebellious, cursed, and separated from God; what apology can
   be made for the weakness and ignorance of that holy martyr, if we shall
   suppose him to have had apprehensions like those in these epistles of
   that sacred order, for omitting those all-conquering reasons which they
   would have supplied him withal to his purpose in hand, and pitching on
   arguments every way less cogent and useful? But I say I shall not
   insist on any such things as these, but only, --

   4. I say that there is not in any of the doctor's excerpta from these
   epistles, nor in any passage in them, any mention or the least
   intimation of any church whereunto any bishop was related, but such an
   one as whose members met all together in one place, and with their
   bishop disposed and ordered the affairs of the church. Such was that
   whereunto the holy martyr was related; such were those neighbouring
   churches that sent bishops or elders to that church; and when the
   doctor proves the contrary, "erit mihi magnus Apollo." From the
   churches, and their state and constitution, is the state and condition
   of their officers, and their relation to them, to be taken. Let that be
   manifested to be such, from the appointment of Jesus Christ by his
   apostles, or de facto in the days of Ignatius, or before the
   contemperation of ecclesiastical affairs, occasionally or by choice, to
   the civil constitution of cities and provinces in those days, as would,
   or possibly could, bear a rural, diocesan, metropolitical hierarchy,
   and this controversy will be at an end. When this is by any attempted
   to be demonstrated, I desire it may not be with such sentences as that
   urged by our doctor from Epist. ad Eph., Iesous Christos tou patros he
   gnome, hos kai hoi episkopoi hoi kata ta perata horisthentes Iesou
   Christou gnome eisin; the expression in it concerning Christ being
   unsound, unscriptural; concerning bishops, unintelligible or
   ridiculous. But it may be said, "What need we any more writing, what
   need we any truer proof or testimony? the learned doctor, in his
   Dissertations, Dissert. iv. cap. v. hath abundantly discharged this
   work, and proved the seven bishops of the seven churches mentioned Rev.
   ii., iii., to have been metropolitans or archbishops, so that no just
   cause remains why we should farther contend."

   Let, then, the reader pardon this my utmost excursion in this
   digression, to whose compass I had not the least thought of going forth
   at the entrance thereof, and I shall return thither whence I have
   turned aside.

   Dissert. iv. cap. v., the doctor tells us that "Septem ecclesiarum
   angeli, non tantum episcopi sed et metropolitæ, i.e., archiepiscopi
   statuendi sunt, i.e., principalium urbium exarchoi ad quos provinciæ
   integræ et in iis multarum inferiorum urbium ecclesiæ, earumque
   episcopi tanquam ad archiepiscopum aut metropolitanum pertinebant."

   The doctor in this chapter commences per saltum, and taking it for
   granted that he hath proved diocesan bishops sufficiently before,
   though he hath scarce spoken any one word to that purpose in his whole
   book (for to prove one superintending in a church by the name of
   bishop, others acting in some kind of subordination to him by the name
   of elders and presbyters, will, upon the account of what hath been
   offered concerning the state of the churches in those days, no way
   reach to the maintenance of this presumption), he sacrifices his pains
   to the metropolitical archiepiscopal dignity, which, as we must
   suppose, is so clearly founded in Scripture and antiquity that they are
   as blind as bats and moles who cannot see the ground and foundation of
   it.

   But, first, be it taken for granted that the angels of the seven
   churches are to be taken for the governors of those churches, then that
   each angel be an individual bishop of the church to which he did
   belong; secondly, be it also granted that they were bishops of the most
   eminent church or churches in that province, or Roman political
   distribution of those countries in the management of the government of
   them, I say bishops of such churches, not "urbium exarchoi," as the
   doctor terms them; -- what advance is made by all this to the assertion
   of a metropolitical archiepiscopacy I cannot as yet discover. That they
   were ordinary officers of Christ's institution, relating in their
   office and ordinary discharge of it not only to the particular churches
   wherein they were placed, but to many churches also, no less committed
   to their charge than those wherein they did reside, the officers,
   rulers, governors of which churches depended on them, not only as to
   their advice and counsel, but as to their power and jurisdiction,
   holding their place and employment from them, is some part of that
   which, in this undertaking, is incumbent on our doctor to make good, if
   he will not be supposed to prevaricate in the cause in hand. To this
   end he informs us, sect. secunda, that in the New Testament there is in
   sundry places mention made of "churches" in the plural number, as Gal.
   i. 2, 22; 1 Thess. ii. 14; Acts ix. 31, xv. 41; 1 Cor. xvi. 1; Rev. i.
   11; -- sometimes of "church" only in the singular number, as Acts viii.
   1, xi. 26, xv. 3, 4, 22, Rom. xvi. 1; 1 Cor. i. 2; 2 Cor. i. 1; 1
   Thess. i. 1; Rev. ii. 1, 8, 12, 18, iii. 1, 7, 14. Now, this is an
   observation, which as we are not at all beholden to the doctor for it,
   no more, I suppose, will there be found to be to it when the reason of
   it shall be a little weighed and considered. The sum is, that the name
   "church" in the singular number is never used but when it relates to
   the single congregation in, or of, one city or town; that of "churches"
   respecting the several churches or congregations that were gathered in
   any country or province. Manifest, then, is it from hence that there is
   in the New Testament no "church" of one denomination beyond a single
   congregation; and where there are more, they are always called
   "churches." How evidently this is destructive to any diocesan or
   metropolitical officer, who hath no church left him thereby of Christ's
   institution to be related to, another opportunity will manifest. For
   the present, let us see what use our doctor makes of this observation.

   Sect. 3, says he, "Judea, and the rest of the places where churches are
   mentioned, are the names of provinces eparchion, quatenus eæ paroikiais
   et dioikesesi, contradistinguntur." If the doctor takes these words in
   an ecclesiastical sense, he begs that which will, upon such unworthy
   terms, never be granted him; but if no more be intended but that Judea,
   Galatia, and the like names of countries, were provinces wherein were
   many churches, Smyrna, Ephesus, of towns and cities wherein there was
   but one, we grant it with him.

   And how much that concession of ours is to his advantage hath been
   intimated. And this seems to be his intendment by his following words:
   "Provinciarum inquam in quibus plurimæ civitates, singulæ singularum
   ecclesiarum sedes, comprehendebantur, ideoque ecclesiæ in plurali
   istius sive istius provinciæ dicendæ." Well, what then? "Cum tamen
   unaquæque civitas, cure territorio sibi adjuncto (leros!) ab episcopo
   suo administrata, singularis ecclesia dicenda sit; ideoque quod kat'
   ekklesian, factum dicitur, Acts xiv. 23; kata polin, fieri jubetur,
   Titus i. 5." That in every city there was a singular church in those
   provinces (I speak of those where any number were converted to the
   faith) I grant; for the annexed territories let the doctor take care,
   there being one church at Corinth and another at Cenchrea: so that
   every single city had its own single church, with its bishops in it, as
   at Philippi. The passage mentioned by the doctor concerning the Epistle
   of Dionysius to the Church at Gortyna in Crete is very little to his
   purpose; neither doth he call Philip, the bishop of that church, the
   bishop of all the other churches in Crete, as the doctor intimates, but
   the bishop of them to whom especially and eminently he wrote.

   Sect 4, application is made of the forementioned observation, sect. 2,
   and the interpretation given of it, sect. 3, in these words: "His sic
   positis, illud statim sequitur ut (in imperii cognitione) in provincia
   qualibet, cure plures urbes sint, una tamen primaria, et principalis
   censenda erat, metropolis ideo dicta, cui itidem inferiores reliquæ
   civitates subjiciebantur, ut civitatibus regiones, sic et inter
   ecclesias et cathedras episcopales unam semper primariam et
   metropoliticam fuisse."

   In this section the doctor hath most ingenuously and truly given us the
   rise and occasion of his diocesan and metropolitical prelates. From the
   aims of men to accommodate ecclesiastical or church affairs to the
   state and condition of the civil government, and distributions of
   provinces, metropolitan cities, and chief towns, within the several
   dependencies (the neighbouring villages being cast in as things of no
   great esteem to the lot of the next considerable town and seat of
   judicature), did the hierarchy which he so sedulously contendeth for
   arise. What advantages were afforded to the work by the paucity of
   believers in the villages and less towns (from which at length the
   whole body of heathenish idolaters were denominated Pagans); the first
   planting of churches in the greater cities; the eminence of the
   officers of the first churches in those cities; the weakness of many
   rural bishops; the multiplying and growing (in numbers, and persons of
   gifts, abilities, and considerable fortunes and employments in this
   world,) in the metropolitan cities, with their fame thereby; the
   tradition of the abode of some one or other of the apostles in such
   cities and churches; the eminent accommodation for the administration
   of civil jurisdiction and other affairs, which appeared in that
   subordination and dependency whereinto the provinces, chief cities, and
   territories in the Roman empire were cast; with what opportunities
   Satan got by these means to introduce the ways, state, pomp, words,
   phrases, terms of honour of the world into the churches, insensibly
   getting ground upon them, and prevailing to their declension from the
   naked simplicity and purity wherein they were first planted, -- some
   other occasion may give advantage for us to manifest. For the present
   it may suffice that it is granted that the magnific hierarchy of the
   church arose from the accommodation of its state and condition [to
   that] of the Roman empire and provinces; and this, in the instances of
   after-ages that might be produced, will easily be made yet farther
   evident in those shameful, or, indeed, rather shameless, contests which
   fell out among the bishops of the third century and downward about
   precedency, titles of honour, extent of jurisdiction, ecclesiastical
   subjection to or exemption from one another. The considerableness of
   their cities, in the civil state of the Roman empire, where they did
   reside was still the most prevalent and cogent argument in their
   brawls. The most notable brush that in all antiquity we find given to
   the great leviathan of Rome, who sported himself in those "gatherings
   together of the waters of people, and multitudes, and nations, and
   tongues," or the "general councils," as they are called, was from an
   argument taken from the seat of the empire being fixed at
   Constantinople, making it become new Rome, so that the bishop of the
   church there was to enjoy equal privileges with him whose lot was
   fallen in the old imperial city. Rut our doctor adds, --

   Sect. 5, "Illud ex Judæorum exemplari transcripsisse apostoli videntur;
   cum Mosaica id lege cautum esset, ut judices et ministri in qualibet
   civitate ordinarentur, Deut. xvi. 18. Illi vero in rebus dubiis ad
   judicem (Mosis successorem) synedrio Hierosolymitano cinctum recurrere
   tenerentur," cap. xvii. 9. And in sect. 6, he proves Jerusalem to have
   been the metropolis of that whole nation. Egregiam vero laudem! But, --

   1. The doctor, I presume, knows before this that those with whom he
   hath to do will never give him the thing in question upon his begging
   or request. That which alone falls in under our consideration and
   inquiry is, whether the apostles instituted any such model of church
   order and government as is by the doctor contended for: to this he
   tells you that the apostles seem to have done it from the pattern of
   Mosaical institutions in the church of the Jews. But, doctor, the
   question is not with what respect they did it, but whether they did it
   at all or no. This the doctor thought good to let alone until another
   time, if we would not grant him upon his petition that so they did.

   2. This, then, is the doctor's second argument for his diocesan and
   metropolitan prelates; his first was from the example of the heathens
   in their civil administration and rule, this second from the example of
   the Jews. Not to divert into the handling of the church and political
   state of the Jews as appointed of God, nor into that dissonancy that is
   between the institution of civil magistrates and evangelical
   administrations, this is the sum of the doctor's reasoning in his 5th,
   6th, 7th, and 8th sections:-- "God, in the church and among the people
   of the Jews, chose out one city to place his name there, making it the
   place where all the types and ceremonies which he had appointed for the
   discovery and shadowing forth of the Lord Jesus Christ were visibly and
   gloriously to be managed, acted, and held forth (sundry of them being
   such as whose typicalness would have been destroyed by their
   multiplication), and principally on this account making that place or
   city (which was first Shiloh) the seat of the kingdom, or habitation of
   the chief ruler for the administration of justice, who appointed judges
   in all the land, for the good and peace of the people; therefore, the
   churches of Jesus Christ, dispersed over the face of the whole world,
   freed from obligations to cities or mountains, walking before God in
   and with a pure and spiritual worship, having no one reason of that
   former institution in common with the church of the Jews, must be cast
   into the same mould and figure." I hope without offence I may take
   leave to deny the consequence, and what more I have to say to this
   argument I shall yet defer.

   But the doctor proceeds to prove that indeed the apostles did dispose
   of the churches in this frame and order, according to the pattern of
   the civil government of the Roman empire and that instituted of God
   among the Jews. The 9th section, wherein he attempts the proof of this
   assertion, is as followeth:--

   "Ad hanc imaginem, apostolos ecclesias ubique disponendas curasse, et
   in omnibus plantationibus suis, minorum ab eminentioribus civitatibus
   dependentiam, et subordinationem constituisse exemplis quidem plurimis
   monstrari possit, illud in Syria et Cilicia patet, Acts xvi. 4; cum
   enim zetema illud, cap. xv. 2, Hierosolymas referretur ab ecclesia
   idios Antiochiæ, cap. xiv. 26, xv. 3; et decretum ab apostolis denuo ad
   eos mitteretur, ver. 22; in epistola, qua decretum illud continebatur
   simul cum Antiochensibus tous kata Surian kai Kilikian adelphous
   comprehensos videmus, ver. 23. Dein epistola ista Antiochenæ ecclesiæ
   reddita, ver. 30. Paulus tandem et Silas Syriam et Cilieiam
   peragrantes, ver. 41, cap. xvi. 4, dogmata kekrimena hupo ton
   apostolon, singulis civitatibus observanda tradiderunt, ut quæ ad hanc
   Antiochiæ metropolin, ut totidem subordinatæ ecclesiæ pertinerent; ut
   et ipsa Antiochia ad Hierosolymas, primariam tam latæ (ut ex Philone
   prædiximus) provinciæ metropolin pertinebat, et ad eam ad dirimendam
   litem istam se conferebat."

   This being all that the doctor hath to produce from the Scripture to
   his purpose in hand, I have transcribed it at large; for this being
   removed, all that follows will fall of its own accord:--

   First, then, the dependence on and subordination of lesser cities to
   the greater is asserted as an apostolical institution. Now, because I
   suppose the doctor will not assert, nor doth intend, a civil dependence
   and subordination of cities as such among themselves; nor will a
   dependence as to counsel, advice, assistance, and the like supplies,
   which in their mutual communion the lesser churches might receive from
   the greater and more eminent, serve his turn; but an ecclesiastical
   dependence and subordination, such as whereby many particular churches,
   with inferior officers residing in them and with them, depended on and
   were in subjection unto some one person of a superior order, commonly
   residing in some eminent city, and many of these governors of a
   superior order in the greater cities were in such subordination unto
   some one of high degree, termed a metropolitan, and all this by
   apostolical institution, is that which he aimeth at: which being a most
   gallant adventure in a waking generation, we shall doubtless find him
   quitting himself like a man in his undertaking.

   Secondly, then, he tells you that the question about Mosaical rites and
   necessity of their observation was referred to Jerusalem by the single
   church of Antioch. But how does the doctor make good this first step?
   which yet if he could, would do him he good at all. It is true that
   Paul was now come to Antioch, chap. xiv. 26; also, that he was brought
   on his way by the church, chap. xv. 3; but yet that the brethren who
   were taught the doctrine contested about, verses 1, 2, were only of the
   church of Antioch (when it is most certain, from the epistles of Paul
   to the Galatians, Colossians, Romans, and others, that great
   disturbance was raised far and wide, in all the churches of the
   Gentiles, about this controversy), nothing is offered. It seems,
   indeed, that their disputes grew to the greatest height at Antioch,
   whither brethren from other parts and churches did also come whilst
   Barnabas and Paul abode there; but that that single church referred the
   determining of that controversy to them at Jerusalem, exclusively to
   others, the doctor proves not. And it is most evident, from the return
   of the answer sent by the apostles from Jerusalem, verse 23, that the
   reference was from all the churches of the Gentiles, yea, and all the
   scattered brethren, perhaps as yet not brought into church order, not
   only at Antioch, but also throughout Syria and Cilicia. It is then
   granted, what he next observes, namely, that in the answer returned
   from Jerusalem, with them at Antioch those in Syria and Cilicia are
   joined; the reason of it being manifest, namely, their trouble about
   the same controversy being no less than theirs at Antioch. It is also
   granted, that, as Paul passed through the cities, he delivered them the
   decrees to keep that were ordained by the apostles and elders, chap.
   xvi. 4; and that not only to the churches of Syria and Cilicia, which
   he left, chap. xv. 41, but also to those throughout Phrygia and the
   region of Galatia, chap. xvi. 6. What now follows out of all this? What
   but that Antioch, by apostolical institution, was the metropolitan see
   of all the churches of Syria and Cilicia! Good doctor, do not be angry,
   but tell us how this may be proved. Why, doubtless it was so, as
   Antioch belonged to the metropolitan church at Jerusalem, as he told us
   out of Philo! (who was excellently acquainted with apostolical
   institutions.) What Jerusalem was to the whole church and nation of the
   Jews, whilst the name of God was fixed there, we know; but what was the
   primitive estate of the churches of Jesus Christ, made up of Jews and
   Gentiles, tied neither to city nor mountain, I must be pardoned if I
   cannot find the doctor making any tender of manifesting or declaring.
   The reason of referring this controversy unto a determination at
   Jerusalem the Holy Ghost acquaints us with, chap. xv. 2; so that we
   have no need of this metropolitical figment to inform us in it. And now
   if we will not only not submit to diocesan bishops, but also not
   reverence the grave metropolitans, standing upon such clear apostolical
   institution, it is fit that all the world should count us the arrantest
   schismatics that ever lived since Pope Boniface's time. The sum, then,
   of this doughty argument for the apostolical institution of
   metropolitans (that none might ever more dare to call diocesans into
   question hereafter) is this: Paul, who was converted about the third or
   fourth year of Caligula, five or six years after the ascension of
   Christ, having with great success for three years preached the gospel,
   went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, upon the persecution raised against
   him at Damascus, chap. ix. 22-27; whence, returning to his work, he
   went first to Tarsus, verse 30; thence to Antioch, where he abode one
   whole year, chap. xi. 25, 26; and was then sent to Jerusalem with the
   collection for the saints, about the fourth year of Claudius, verses
   29, 30; thence returning again to Antioch, he was sent out by the
   command of the Holy Ghost, more eminently and peculiarly than formerly,
   for the conversion of the Gentiles, chap. xiii. 1-3. In this
   undertaking, in the space of a year or two, he preached and gathered
   churches (whereof express mention is made) at Salamis, chap. xiii. 5;
   at Paphos, verse 6; at Perga in Pamphylia, verse 13; at Antioch in
   Pisidia, verse 14; at Iconium, chap. xiv. 1; at Lystra and Derbe, verse
   6; and at Perga, verse 25: in all these places gathering some believers
   to Christ; whom, before they returned to Antioch, he visited all over
   the second time, and settled elders in the several congregations, chap.
   xiv. 21-23. In this journey and travel for the propagation of the
   gospel, he seems in all places to have been followed, almost at the
   heels, by the professing Pharisees, who imposed the necessity of the
   observation of the Mosaical ceremonies upon his new converts; for
   instantly upon his return to Antioch, where, during his absence,
   probably they had much prevailed, he falls into dispute with them,
   chap. xv. 1, 2 -- and that he was not concerned in this controversy
   only upon the account of the church of Antioch, himself informs us,
   Gal. ii. 4, affirming that the false brethren which caused those
   disputes and dissensions crept in to spy out his liberty in his
   preaching the gospel among the Gentiles, verse 2, -- that is, in the
   places before mentioned, throughout a great part of Asia. For the
   appeasing of this difference, and the establishing of the souls of the
   disciples, which were grievously perplexed with the imposition of the
   Mosaical yoke, it is determined that the case should be resolved by the
   apostles, Acts xv. 2; partly because of their authority in all the
   churches, wherein those who contended with Paul would be compelled to
   acquiesce, and partly because those Judaizing teachers pretended the
   commission of the apostles for the doctrine they preached, as is
   evident from the disclaimure made by them of any such commission or
   command, verse 24. Upon Paul's return from the assembly at Jerusalem,
   wherein the great controversy about Jewish ceremonies was stated and
   determined, after he had in the first place delivered the decrees and
   apostolical salutation by epistle to the church at Antioch, he goes
   with them also to the churches in Syria and Cilicia, expressed in the
   letter by name, as also to those in Pamphylia, Pisidia, Derbe, Lystra,
   Iconium, etc., chap. xvi. 1-4, and all the churches which he had
   gathered and planted in his travels through Asia, whereunto he was
   commanded by the Holy Ghost, chap. xiii. 1, 2. Things being thus
   stated, it necessarily follows that the apostles had instituted
   diocesan and metropolitan bishops; for though the churches were so
   small, and thin, and few in number, that, seven years after this, may
   we believe our doctor, the apostles had not instituted or appointed any
   elders or presbyters in them, -- namely, when Paul wrote his epistle to
   the Philippians, which was when he was prisoner in Rome, as appears,
   chap. i. 7, 13, 14, iv. 22, about the third year of Nero, -- yet that
   he had fully built and settled the hierarchical fabric contended for,
   who once dares question!


   "Audacia --

   Creditur a multis fiducia."

   [Juven., xiii. 109, 110.]

   But if this will not do, yet Ignatius hits the nail on the head, and is
   ready at hand to make good whatsoever the doctor will have him say, and
   his testimony takes up the sense of the two next following sections,
   whereof the first is as follows:--

   "Hinc dicti Ignatiani ratio constat in epistola ad Romanos, ubi ille
   Antiochiæ episcopus se tes en Suria ekklesias poimena, pastorem
   ecclesiæ quæ est in Syria appellet, eum ad Antiochiam, scil. ut ad
   metropolin suam tota Syria pertineret. Sic et author epistolæ ad
   Antiochenos, ekklesia Theou paroikouse en Suria te en Antiocheia, eam
   inscribens totam, Syriam ejus paroikian esse concludit."

   But yet I fear the doctor will find he hath need of other weapons and
   other manner of assistance to make good the cause he hath undertaken.
   The words of Ignatius in that epistle to the Romans are, [cap. ix.]
   Mnemoneuete en te euche humon tes en Suria ekklesias hetis ant' emou
   poimeni chretai to Kurio. Because he recommends to them that particular
   church in Syria, which, by his imprisonment, was deprived of its
   pastor, therefore, without doubt, he was a metropolitical archbishop:
   "Tityre, tu patulæ," etc. But the doctor is resolved to carry his
   cause; and therefore, being forsaken of all fair and honest means from
   whence he might hope for assistance or success, he tries (as Saul the
   witch of Endor) the counterfeit, spurious title of a counterfeit
   epistle to the Antiochians, to see if that will speak any comfortable
   words for his relief or no. And to make sure work, he causes this
   gentleman so to speak as if he intended to make us believe that Syria
   was in Antioch, not Antioch in Syria; as in some remote parts of the
   world, they say, they inquire whether London be in England or England
   in London. What other sense can be made of the words as by the doctor
   transcribed? Ekklesia Theou paroikouse en Suria te en Antiocheia? --
   "To the church of God dwelling in Syria, which is in Antioch." Now if
   this be so, I shall confess it is possible we may be in more errors
   than one, and that we much want the learned doctor's assistance for our
   information. The words themselves, as they are used by the worshipful
   writer of that epistle, will scarce furnish us with this learned and
   rare notion: they are at length, Ignatios ho kai Theophoros (for so he
   first opens his mouth with a lie), ekklesia heleemene hupo Theou,
   eklelegmene hupo Christou paroikouse en Suria, kai prote Christou
   eponumian labouse te en Antiocheia. What is here more expressed than
   that the latter passage, "In Antioch," is restrictive of what went and
   before was spoken of its residence in Syria, with reference to the name
   of Christians, first given to the disciples in that place, I know not;
   and therefore it is most certain that the apostles instituted
   metropolitan archbishops hoper edei deixai!

   But to make all sure, the learned doctor will not so give over; but,
   sect. 11, he adds that the epigraph of the epistle to the Romans grants
   him the whole case; that is, Ekklesia hetis prokathetai en topo choriou
   Rhomaion; "Ex qua," saith he, "ecclesiæ Romanæ, ejusque episcopo super
   ecclesiis omnibus in urbicaria regione, aut provincia Romana contentis,
   præfecturam competiise videmus."

   Although I have spent some time in the consideration of men's
   conjectures of those suburbicarian churches, that, as is pretended, are
   here pointed to, and the rise of the bishop of Rome's jurisdiction over
   those churches, in a correspondency to the civil government of the
   prefect of the city, yet so great a critic in the Greek tongue as
   Casaubon, Exer. xvi. ad An. 150, having professed that expression, En
   topo choriou Rhomaion, to be "barbarous" and "unintelligible," I shall
   not contend about it. For the presidency mentioned of the church in or
   at Rome, that it was a presidency of jurisdiction, and not only an
   eminency of faith and holiness, that is intended, the doctor thinks it
   not incumbent on him to prove, -- those with whom he hath to do are of
   another mind, -- although by this time some alteration might be
   attempted, yea there was, as elsewhere shall be showed. And so much for
   Ignatius' archiepiscopacy.

   The example of Alexandria is urged in the next place, in these words:
   "Idem de Alexandria, de qua Eusebius, Marcum, Ekklesias proto ep' autes
   Alexandreias sustesasthai, Ecclesias (in plurali) primum in Alexandria
   instituisse. Has omnes ab eo sub nomine tes en Alexandreia paroikias,
   administrandas suscepisse Annianum, Neronis anno octavo idem Eusebius
   affirmat; quibus patet primariam Alexandria et patriarchalem cathedram
   fixam esse, ad quam reliquæ provinciæ illius ecclesiæ a Marco plantatæ,
   ut ad metropoliticam suam pertinebant." Doubtless; for, -- 1. There is
   not any passage in any ancient author more clearly discovering the
   uncertainty of many things in antiquity than this pointed to by the
   doctor in Eusebius; for, first, the sending of Mark the evangelist into
   Egypt, and his preaching there at Alexandria what he had written in the
   Gospel, is but a report. Men said so, but what ground they had for
   their saying so he relates not. And yet we know what a foundation of
   many assertions by following writers this rumour or report is made to
   be. 2. In the very next words the author affirms, and insists long upon
   it in the next chapter, that Philo's book peri tou biou ton Asketon,
   was written concerning the Christians converted by Mark's preaching at
   Alexandria, when it is notoriously known that it treateth of the
   Essenes, a sect among the Jews, amongst whose observances many things
   were vain, superstitious, and foolish, unworthy to be once applauded as
   the practice of any Christian in those days; that same Philo, as far as
   can be gathered, living and dying in the Jewish religion, having been
   employed by them with an apology to Rome in the days of Caligula. But,
   3. Suppose that Mark were at Alexandria, and preached the gospel there
   (which is not improbable), and planted sundry churches in that great
   and populous city of Jews and Gentiles; and that, as an evangelist, the
   care of those churches was upon him in a peculiar manner; nay, and add
   farther, that after his death, as Jerome assures us, the elders and
   presbyters of those churches chose out one among themselves to preside
   in their convocations and meetings; -- if, I say, all this be supposed,
   what will ensue? Why, then, it is manifest that there was fixed at
   Alexandria a patriarchal chair and a metropolitical church, according
   to the appointment of Jesus Christ by his apostles! "Si hoc non sit
   probationum satis, nescio quid sit satis." If some few congregations
   live together in love, and communion, and the fellowship of the gospel
   in a city, he is stark blind that sees not that to be an archbishop's
   see. The reason is as clear as his in the Comedian for the freedom of
   his wife:-- "Sy. Utinam Phrygiam uxorem meam una mecum videam liberam.
   Dem. Optimam mulierem quidem. Sy. Et quidem nepoti tuo, hujus filio,
   hodie primam mammam dedit hæc. Dem. Hercle, vero, serio, siquidem
   primam dedit haud dubium quin emitti æquom siet. Mic. Ob eam rem? Dem.
   Ob eam." [7] And there is an end of the contest. The doctor, indeed,
   hath sundry other sections added to those foregoing; which as they
   concern times more remote from those who first received the apostolical
   institutions, so I must ingenuously profess that I cannot see any thing
   whereon to fasten a suspicion of a proof, so far as to call it into
   examination, and therefore I shall absolve the reader from the penalty
   of this digression.

   The truth is, when I first named Ignatius for a witness in the cause I
   am pleading for, I little thought of that excursion which I have
   occasionally been drawn out unto. When first I cast an eye, some few
   months since, upon the dissertations of the learned doctor in defence
   of episcopacy, and saw it so chequered with Greek and Latin, so full of
   quotations divine and human, I began to think that he dealt with his
   adversaries "hastisque, clypeisque, et saxis grandibus," that there
   would be no standing before his shower of arguments. But after a little
   serious perusal, I must take leave to say that I was quickly of another
   mind; with the reason of which change of thoughts, could I once obtain
   the leisure of a few days or hours, I should quickly, God willing,
   acquaint them who are concerned in affairs of this nature. In the
   meantime, if the reader will pardon me this digression, having given
   him an account of my thoughts concerning the epistles of Ignatius, I
   shall, in a procedure upon my first intention, bring forth some
   testimonies from him, "et valeant quantum valere possunt."

   He seems, in the first place, to speak sufficiently clearly to the
   death of Christ for his church, for believers, in a peculiar manner;
   which is one considerable bottom and foundation of the truth we plead
   for: Epist. ad Trall. [cap. viii.], Ginesthe mimetai pathematon
   (Christou), kai agapes autou hen emapesen hemas, dous heauton peri
   hemon lutron, hina to haimati autou katharise hemas palaias dussezeias,
   kai zoen hemin paraschetai, mellontas, hoson oudepo, apollusthai hupo
   tes en hemin kakias.

   And again, Epist. ad. Philad. [cap. ix.]: By Christ, saith he,
   eiselthon Abraam, kai Isaak, kai Iakob, Moses, kai ho sumpas ton
   propheton choros, kai hoi stuloi tou kosmou hoi apostoloi, kai he
   numphe tou Christou huper hes (phernes logo) exeches to oikeion haima,
   hina auten exagorase; with many the like expressions. His confidence
   also of the saints' perseverance, for whom Christ thus died, he doth
   often profess. Speaking of the faith of the gospel, he adds: Tauta ho
   gnous en plerophoria kai pisteusas makarios, hosper oun kai humeis
   philotheoi kai philochristoi este, en plerophoria tes elpidos humon,
   hes ektrapenai medeni humon genetai.

   And again more clearly and fully to the same purpose Epist. ad Smyrn.
   [cap. i.]: Enoeas gar humas katertismenous en akineto pistei, hosper
   kathelomenous en to stauro tou Kuriou hemon Iesou Christou, sarki te
   kai pneumati kai hedrasmenous en agape en to aimati tou Christou,
   peplerophoremenous hos alethos, etc. And this confirmation and
   establishment in believing he ascribes not their manly considerations,
   but to the grace of Christ, exclusively to any of their own strength,
   Epist. ad Smyrn. [cap. iv.]: Panta, saith he of himself, hupomeno dia
   Christon, eis to sumpathein auto, autou endunamountos, ou gar moi
   tosouton sthenos.

   To the same purpose, and with the same confident persuasion, he speaks,
   Epist. ad Ephesians, [cap. ix.]:--

   Rhusetai humas Iesous Christos, ho themeliosas humas epi ten petran, os
   lithous eklektous euarmologoumenous eis oikodomen theian Patros,
   anapheromenous eis ta hupse dia Christou, tou huper hemon
   staurothentos, schoino chromenous to Hagio Pneumati, etc.

   And again in the same epistle [cap. xiv.]: Arche zoes pistis telos de
   agape;, ta de duo en enoteti genomena Theou anthropon apotelei; ta de
   alla panta eis kalokagathian akolouatha esti.

   And in his last epistle [ad Rom. cap. vii.], he gives us that noble
   expression of his own assurance: Ho emos eros estaurotai, kai ouk estin
   en emoi pur philoun ti; hudor de zon allomenon en emoi, esothen moi
   legei, Deuro pros ton Patera; where we leave the holy soul until the
   same God gather us to him and the rest of the spirits of just men made
   perfect.

   And this was the language, these were the exressions, of this holy man;
   which what they discover of his judgment on the case under
   consideration is left to the learned reader to consider. This I am
   certain, our adversaries have very little cause to boast of the consent
   of the primitive Christians with them in the doctrine of apostasy,
   there being in these ancient writers after the apostles, about the
   things of our religion, not the left shadow cast upon it for its
   refreshment.

   Add, in the next place, the most ancient of the Latins, Tertullian,
   that great storehouse of all manner of leaning and knowledge. Saith
   "Quemadmodum nobis arrhabonem spiritus reliquit, ita et a nobis
   arrhabonem carnis accepit, et vexit in coelum, pignus totius summæ
   illuc redigendæ," Tertull., De Resur. The certain salvation of the
   whole body of Christ, with whom he hath that communion as to give them
   his Spirit, as he took their flesh (for he took upon him flesh and
   blood, because the children were partakers of the same), is evidently
   asserted; which he could not do who thought that any of those on whom
   he bestowed his Spirit might perish everlastingly.

   And again, De Præscripti. advers. Hæret.: "In pugna pugilum et
   gladiatorum, plerumque non quia fortis est, vincit quis, aut quia non
   potest vinci; sed quoniam ille qui victus est, nullis viribus fuit:
   adeo idem ille victor bene valenti postea comparatus, etiam superatus
   recedit. Non aliter hæreses de quorundam infirmitatibus habent quod
   valent, nihil valentes si in bene valentem fidem incurrant. Solent
   quidem isti infirmines etiam de quibusdam personis ab hæresi captis
   ædificari in ruinam; quare ille vel illa, fidelissimi, prudentissimi,
   et usitatissimi in ecclesia, in illam partem transiterunt? Quis hoc
   dicens non ipse sibi respondet, neque prudentes, neque fideles, neque
   usitatos æstimandos quos hæresis potuit demutare?" He plainly denies
   them to have been believers (that is, truly, thoroughly, properly so)
   who fall into pernicious heresies to their destruction.

   Cyprian is express to our purpose. Saith he, "Nemo existimet bonos de
   ecclesia posse discedere. Triticum non rapit ventus, nec arborem solida
   radice fundatam procella subvertit; Inanes paleæ tempestate jactantur,
   invalidæ arbores turbinis incursione evertuntur. Hos execratur et
   percutit Johannes apostolus, dicens, Ex nobis exierunt, sed non fuerunt
   ex nobis, si enim fuissent ex nobis, mansissent utique nobiscum,'?"
   Cypr. De Unit. Eccles. [cap. ii.] The whole doctrine we contend for is
   plainly and clearly asserted, and bottomed on a text of Scripture;
   which in a special manner (as we have cause) we do insist upon. All
   that is lost by temptations in the church was but chaff; the wheat
   abides, and the rooted tree is not cast down. Those fall away who
   indeed were never true believers in heart and by union, whatever their
   profession was. And yet we are within the compass of that span of time
   which our adversaries, without proof, without shame, claim to be
   theirs. One principal foundation of our doctrine is the bestowing of
   the Holy Ghost upon believers, by Jesus Christ. Where he is so
   bestowed, there, say we, he abides; for he is given them for that end,
   -- namely, to "abide with them for ever." Now, concerning him Basil
   tells us, that "though, in a sort, he may be said to be present with
   all that are baptized, yet he is never mixed with any that are not
   worthy; that is, he dwells not with any that obtain not salvation,"
   Basil, Lib. de Spir. Sanc. cap. xvi.; -- Nun men gar ei kai me
   anakekratai tois anaxiois; alla oun pareinai dokei pos tois hapax
   esphragismenois. By that seeming presence of the Holy Ghost with
   hypocrites that are baptized professors, he evidently intends the
   common gifts and graces that he bestows upon them; and this is all he
   grants to them who are not at last (for such he discourses of) found
   worthy.

   Macarius Ægyptius, Homil. v., about the same time with the other, or
   somewhat before, is of the same mind. He tells us that those who are
   Christians en aletheia kai dunamei, asphaleis eisin hupo tou
   arrhabonos, hou edexanto nun, hos ede estephanomenoi kai basileuontes.
   And how men can be assured of heaven whilst they live here, by the
   earnest of it which they have received, as well as if they were crowned
   and reigning in heaven, if those who have received that earnest may
   lose it again, I know not.

   The words of Ambrose to this same purpose, lib. i. cap. vi. De Jacob.
   et Vita Beat. are many; but because they do not only fully assert the
   truth we contend for, but also insist briefly on most of the arguments
   with which in this case we plead, I shall transcribe them at large, and
   they are as follow:--

   "Non gloriabor quia justus sum, sed gloriabor quia redemptus sum;
   gloriabor non quia vacuus peccatis sum, sed quia mihi remissa sunt
   peccata; non gloriabor quia profui, nec quia profuit mihi quisquam, sed
   quia pro me advocatus apud Patrem Christus est, sed quia pro me Christi
   sanguis effusus est ... Hæredem te fecit, cohæredem Christi; Spiritum
   tibi adoptionis infudit ... Sed vereris dubios vitæ anfractus et
   adversarii insidias, cum habeas auxilium Dei, habeas tantam ejus
   dignationem, ut filio proprio pro te non pepercerit? -- Nihil enim
   excepit, qui omnium concessit authorem. Nihil est igitur quod negari
   posse nobis vereamur; nihil est in quo de munificentiæ divinæ diffidere
   perseverantiâ debeamus, cujus fuit tam diuturna et jugis ubertas, ut
   primo prædestinaret, deinde vocaret, et quos vocavit hos et
   justificaret, et quos justificaret hos et glorificaret. Poterit
   deserere quos tantis beneficiis usque ad præmia prosecutus est? Inter
   tot beneficia Dei, num metuendæ sunt aliquæ accusatoris insidiæ? sed
   quis audeat accusare quos electos divino cernit judicio? num Deus Pater
   ipse qui contulit, potest dona sua rescindere, et quos adoptione
   suscepit, eos a paterni affectus gratia relegare? Sed metus est ne
   judex severior fiat. Considera quem judicem habeas; nempe Christo dedit
   Pater omne judicium; poterit te ergo ille damnare, quem redemit a
   morte, pro quo se obtulit, cujus vitam suæ mortis mercedem esse
   cognoscit? nonne dicet, quaæ utilitas in sanguine meo, si damno quem
   ipse salvavi? Denique consideras judicem, non consideras advocatum?"

   The foundation of all our glorying in the love of God and assurance of
   salvation he lays in the free grace of God, in redemption and
   justification; for the certainty of our continuance in that estate, he
   urges the decree of God's predestination, the unchangeableness of his
   love, the complete redemption made by Christ, with his effectual
   intercession: all which are at large insisted upon in the ensuing
   treatise.

   Add to him his contemporary, Chrysostom. Ser. 3, in 2 Cor. i. 21, 22:
   Ho de bebaion hemas sun humin Christon, kai chrisas emas Theos; kai
   sphragisamenos hemas kai dous ton arrhabona tou Pneumatos en tais
   kardiais hemon. Of these words of the apostle he gives the ensuing
   exposition: Palin apo ton parelthonton ta mellonta bebaioutai; ei gar
   autos estin ho bebaion hemas eis Christon (toutestin ho me eon hemas
   parasaleuesthai ek tes pisteos tes eis ton Christon) kai autos ho
   chrisas hemas, kai dous to pneuma en tais kardiais hemon, pos ta
   mellonta ou dosei? ei gar tas archas kai tas hupotheseis edoke, kai ten
   rhizan kai ten pegen (hoion ten alethe peri autou gnosin, ten tou
   pneumatos metalepsin) pos ta ek touton ou dosei? ei gar ekeina dia
   tauta didontai, pollo mallon ho tauta dous kai ekeina parexei; kai ei
   tauta echthrois ousin edoke, pollo mallon ekeina philois genomenois
   charieitai; dia touto oude Pneuma eipen aplos, all' arrhabona
   honomasen, hina apo toutou, kai peri tou pantos tharrhes; ou gar ei me
   emelle to pan didonai, heileto an ton arrhabona paraschein kai apolesai
   eike kai maten.

   The design and aim of our establishment by the Spirit is, he tells us,
   that we be not shaken or moved from the faith of Christ; [he] so
   establisheth us that he suffers us not to depart and fall away from the
   faith. And that the argument which he insists on, -- from what we have
   presently received to an assurance of abode in our condition, to the
   enjoyment of the full inheritance, -- is not contemptible in the cause
   in hand, is farther manifested in the treatise itself.

   And these instances may suffice for the first period of time mentioned,
   before the rising of the Pelagian heresy; of which, and those others of
   the same kind that might be produced, though they may not seem so full
   and expressive to the point under consideration as those which follow
   after, yet concerning those authors and their testimonies these two
   things may be asserted:--

   1. That though some expressions may be gathered, from some of the
   writers within the space of time mentioned, that seem to allow a
   possibility of defection and apostasy in believers, -- occasioned, all
   of them, by the general use of that word, and the taking the several
   accounts whereon men, both in the gospel and in common use, are so
   called, -- yet there is no one of them that ever ascribed the
   perseverance of them who actually and eventually persevere to such
   grounds and principles as Mr Goodwin doth, and which the reader shall
   find at large by him insisted on in the ensuing treatise. The truth is,
   his maintaining of the saints' perseverance is as bad, if not worse,
   than his maintaining their apostasy.

   2. That I scarce know any head in religion concerning which the mind of
   the ancients, who wrote before it received any opposition, may be made
   out more clearly than we have done in this, by the instances produced
   and insisted on.

   The Pelagian heresy began about the year 417. The first opposers
   thereof are reckoned up by Prosper, cap. ii. De Ingrat. The bishop of
   Rome, the Palestine synod in the case of Pelagius, Jerome, Atticus,
   bishop of Constantinople, the synod of Ephesus, [of] Sicily, and two in
   Afric, he mentions in order, concluding them with the second African,
   gathered to that end and purpose:--


   "Anne alium in finem posset procedere sanctum

   Concilium, cui dux Aurelius ingeniumque

   Augustinus erat? quem Christi gratia cornu

   Uberiore rigans, nostro lumen dedit ævo,

   Accensum vero de lumine, nam cibus illi

   Et vita et requies Deus est; omnisque voluptas

   Unus amor Christi est; unus Christi est honor illi:

   Et dum nulla sibi quærit bona, fit Deus illi

   Omnia, et in sancto regnat sapientia templo."

   And because I shall not burden the reader, being now entered upon the
   place and time wherein very many witnesses call aloud to be heard about
   the difference in hand, of the first opposers of the Pelagian heresy, I
   shall insist only on him who is indeed "instar omnium," and hath ever
   been so accounted in the controversies about the grace of God; and I
   shall the rather lay this weight on him, because it is evident that he
   spake the sense of the whole church in those days wherein he lived.
   This is Austin, of whom saith the same Prosper: "Noverint illi non
   solum Romanam ecclesiam Africanamque, sed per omnes mundi partes
   universos promissionis filios, cum doctrinâ, hujus viri, sicut in tota
   fide, ita in gratiæ confessione congruere," Epist. ad Rusti.

   And when his writings began to be carped at by the semi-Pelagians of
   France, Cælestine, bishop of Rome, in his Epist. ad Gallos, gives him
   this testimony: "Augustinum, sanctæ recordationis virum pro vita sua et
   moribus, in nostra communione semper habuimus, nec unquam hunc sinistræ
   suspicionis rumor saltem aspersit, quem tantæ scientiæ olim fuisse
   meminimus, ut inter magistros optimos etiam a meis prædecesseribus
   haberetur." His writings also were made use of not only by Prosper,
   Hilary, and Fulgentius, but generally by all that engaged against the
   Pelagians. "Zosimus," saith Prosper, ad Collar. cap. xli., "cum esset
   doctissimus, adversus libros tamen Pelagianorum beati Augustini
   responsa poscebat." And Leo, Epist. ad Concil. Arausic., transcribes
   out of him verbatim the things that he would have confirmed and
   established. And in his own days, notwithstanding the differences
   between them, the aged and learned Jerome tells him, Epist. xciv.,
   "Mihi decretum est te amare, te suspicere, colere, mirari, tuaque
   dicta, quasi mea, defendere." Hence was that outcry in the Palestine
   synod upon the slighting of his authority by Pelagius "Dixit Pelagius,
   Quis est mihi Augustinus? Acclamabant omnes blasphemantem in episcopum,
   ex cujus ore Dominus universæ Africæ unitatis indulserit sanitatem, non
   solum a conventu illo, sed ab omni ecclesia pellendum," Oros. Apologet.
   pp. 621, 622. So also Gelas. Biblioth. Pat. Tom. 4, Colum. 553, p. 589.

   Fulgentius also, with them assembled with him at Byzacene, when they
   were banished Afric by Thrasimundus, in that synodical epistle, gives
   them this counsel: "Præ omnibus studium gerite libros S. Augustini quos
   ad Prosperum et Hilarium scripsit, memoratis fratribus legendos
   ingerere," Epist. Synod. Byzac. Much more might be added to manifest
   the judgment of Austin to have been the catholic judgment of the church
   in those days; so that in his single testimony as great a number are
   included as in the testimony of any one man in the world whatever.

   Now, the controversy that was between Austin and the Pelagians and
   semi-Pelagians about perseverance, Hilary thus expresseth in his
   epistle to him: "Deinde moleste ferunt," speaking of the
   semi-Pelagians, "ita dividi gratiam, quæ vel tunc primo homini data
   est, vel nunc omnibus datur, ut ille acceperit perseverantiam, non qua
   fieret ut perseveraret, sed sine qua per liberum arbitrium perseverare
   non posset; nunc vero Sanctis in regnum per gratiam prædestinatis, non
   tale adjutorium perseverantiæ detur, sed tale, ut eis perseverantia
   ipsa donetur, non solum ut sine illo dono perseverantes esse non
   possint, verum etiam ut per hoc donum non nisi perseverantes sint.
   Cæterum quicquid libet donatum sit predestinatis, id posse et amittere
   et retinere propria voluntate contendunt." The very state of the
   controversy as now under contest is most clearly expressed in this
   report of the difference between the semi-Pelagians and the church of
   God in those days. And because the whole sum of Mr Goodwin's book is
   briefly comprised in the 9th and 10th chapters of Prosper, De Ingrat.,
   I shall transcribe the 10th chapter, to present to the reader the
   substance and pith of that treatise, as also the state of the
   controversy in those days:--


   ? "Quam sana fides sit vestra patescat,

   Gratia qua Christi populus sumus, hoc cohibetur

   Limite vobiscum, et formam hanc adscribitis illi:

   Ut cunctos vocet ilia quidem, invitetque; nec ullum

   Præteriens, studeat communem afferre salutem

   Esse autem edoctis istam communiter æquam

   Libertatem animis, ut cursum explere beatum

   Persistendo queant, finem effectumque petitum

   Dante Deo, ingeniis qui nunquam desit honestis.

   Sed quia non idem est cunctis vigor, et variarum

   Illecebris rerum trahitur dispersa voluntas,

   Sponte aliquos vitiis succumbere, qui potuissent

   A lapsu revocare pedem, stabilesque manere."

   As I said, we have the sum of Mr Goodwin's book in this declaration of
   the judgment of the semi-Pelagians, so also, in particular, the state
   of the controversy about the perseverance of the saints, as then it was
   debated; and I doubt not but the learned reader will easily perceive it
   to be no other than that which is now agitated between me and Mr
   Goodwin. The controversy, indeed, in the matter between Austin and the
   Pelagians was reduced to three heads:-- As to the foundation of it,
   which Austin concluded to be the decree of predestination: which they
   denied. The impulsive cause of it he proved to be the free grace of
   God; and the measure or quality of that grace to be such as that
   whoever received it did persevere, it being perseverance which was
   given: both which they denied. About the kind of faith which temporary
   professors might have, and fall from it, which were never elected,
   there was between them no contest at all. Of his judgment, then, there
   were these two main heads, which he laboured to confirm:--

   1. That perseverance is a gift of God, and that no man either did or
   could persevere in faith and obedience upon the strength of any grace
   received (much less of his own ability, stirred up and promoted by such
   considerations as Mr Goodwin makes the ground and bottom of the
   perseverance of all that so do), but that the whole was from his grace.
   Subservient to this, he maintained that no one temptation whatsoever
   could be overcome but by some act of grace; and that therefore
   perseverance must needs be a work thereof, it being an abiding in faith
   and obedience notwithstanding and against temptation. To this is that
   of his on John, Homil. 53: "Quosdam nimia voluntatis suæ fiducia
   extulit in superbiam, et quosdam nimia voluntatis suæ diffidentia
   dejecit in negligentiam: illi dicunt quid rogamus Deum ne vincamur
   tentatione quod in nostra est potestate? Isti dicunt, at quid conamur
   bene vivere, quod in Dei est potestate? O Domine, O Pater, qui es in
   coelis, ne nos inferas in quamlibet istarum tentationum, sed libera nos
   a malo. Audiamus Dominum dicentem, Rogavi pro te, Petre, ne fides
   deficiat tua:' ne sic existimemus fidem nostram esse in libero arbitrio
   ut divino non egeat adjutorio," etc. That, with both of these sorts of
   men, the way and work of the grace of God is at this day perverted and
   obscured, is so known to all that it needs no exemplification: some
   requiring no more to the conquest of temptations but men's own rational
   consideration of their eternal state and condition, with the tendency
   of that whereto they are tempted; others turning the grace of God into
   wantonness, and supinely casting away all heedful regard of walking
   with God, being enslaved to their lusts and corruptions, under a
   pretence of God's working all in all; -- the latter denying themselves
   to be men, the former to be men corrupted. And in plain terms the
   Milevitan council tells us: "Si quis finxerit ideo gratiam esse
   necessariam ad vitanda peccata, quia facit hominem cognoscere peccata,
   et discernere inter peccata et non peccata, qua discretione per gratiam
   habita, per liberum arbitrium potest vitare; is procul," etc. The light
   of grace to discern the state of things, the nature of sin, and to
   consider these aright, the Pelagians allowed, -- which is all the
   bottom of that perseverance of saints which we have offered by Mr
   Goodwin; but upon that supply of these means, to abide and persevere in
   faith, to flee and avoid sin, is a thing of our own performance.

   This the doctors of that council, anno 420, condemned as a Pelagian
   fiction, as Prosper also presents it at large, cap. xxv. against
   Cassianus the semi-Pelagian, and farther clears and confirms it. So
   Austin again, De Bono Persev., cap. ii., "Cur perseverantia ista
   petitur a Deo, si non datur a Deo? an et ista irrisoria petitio est,
   cure illud ab eo petitur, quod scitur non ipsum dare, sed ipso non
   dante, esse in hominis potestate? sicut irrisoria est etiam illa
   gratiarum actio, si ex hoc gratiæ aguntur Deo quod non donavit ipse nec
   fecit." And the same argument he useth again, cap. vi. 9, much resting
   on Cyprian's interpretation of the Lord's Prayer; and cap. xxvi., he
   farther presseth it, as to the root and foundation of this gift of God:
   "Si ad liberum arbitrium hominis, quod non secundum gratiam, sed contra
   eam defendis, pertinere dicis, ut perseveret in bono quisquis, vel non
   perseveret, non Deo dante sic perseverat, sed humana voluntate
   faciente." One or two instances more in this kind, amongst hundreds
   that offer themselves, may suffice.

   De Correptione et Gratia, cap. xiv., "Apostolus Judas, cum dicit, Ei
   autem qui potens est,' etc., nonne apertissime ostendit donum Dei esse
   perseverare in bone usque ad finem? quid enim aliud sonat Qui potest
   conservare nos sine offensione, et constituere ante conspectum gloriæ
   suæ, immaculatos in lætitia,' nisi perseverantiam bonam? quis tam
   insulse desipiat, ut neget perseverantiam esse donum Dei, cum dicit
   sanctissimus Jeremias, Timorem meum dabo in corde eorum ut non recedant
   a me,'?" etc. I shall add only that one place more out of the same book
   (cap. xii.), where both the matter and manner of the thing in hand are
   fully delivered: "In hoc loco miseriarum, ubi tentatio est vita hominum
   super terram, virtus in infirmitate perficitur; quæ virtus, nisi Qui
   gloriatur, ut in Domino glorietur?' Ac per hoc de ipsa perseverantia
   boni noluit Deus sanctos suos in viribus suis, sed in ipso gloriari,
   qui eis non solum dat adjutorium quod primo homini dedit, sine quo non
   possit perseverare si velint, sed in iis etiam operatur et velle; et
   quoniam non perseverabunt nisi et possint, et velint, perseverandi eis
   et pessibilitas et voluntas, divinæ gratiæ largitate, donatur; tantum
   quippe Spiritu Sancto accenditur voluntas eorum, ut ideo possint quia
   sic volunt, ideo sic velint, quia Deus operatur ut velint. Nam si tanta
   infirmitate hujus vitæ ipsis relinquitur voluntas sua, ut in adjutorio
   Dei, sine quo perseverare non possent, manerent si vellent, ni Deus in
   eis operatur ut velint, inter tot, et tantas tentationes, infirmitate
   sua succumberet voluntas, et ideo perseverare non possent, quia
   deficientes infirmitare voluntatis non vellent, aut non ita vellent, ut
   possent. Subventum est igitur infirmitati voluntatis humanæ, ut divina
   gratia indeclinabiliter, et insuperabiliter ageretur, et ideo quamvis
   infirma non tamen deficeret." It is not possible that any one should
   deliver his sense more clearly to the whole of our present contest than
   this holy and learned man hath done in the words now repeated from him.
   A gift of God he asserts it to be (and not an act or course of our own,
   whereto we are prompted by certain considerations, and assisted with
   such outward means as are also added to us), to the real production of
   that effect by the efficiency of the grace of God. And for the manner
   of this work, it is, saith he, by the effectual working the actual will
   of perseverance in the continuance of our obedience, in a dispensation
   of grace, different from and beyond what was given to him who had a
   power of persevering if he would, but received not the will thereof.
   Now, to Adam's perseverance there was nothing wanting but his will's
   confirmation in obedience, and his actual doing so. Power he had within
   and means without, abundantly sufficient for that end in their kind.
   This, then, he asserts to be given to the saints, and to be the work of
   God in them, even their actual perseverance. Without this he also
   manifesteth, that, such is the infirmity of our wills, and such the
   power of our temptations, that what means soever may be supplied and
   left to their power, or what manlike, rational considerations soever
   man may engage his thoughts into, it is impossible any should persevere
   to the end: which Bradwardin more confirms, De Caus. Dei, lib. ii. cap.
   viii. Coroll., "Omne quod est naturale, et non est per se tale, si
   manere debeat immutatum, oportet quod innitatur continue alicui fixo
   per se: quare quilibet justus Deo."

   And the holy man (Austin, I mean) concludes, that this work of God
   being wrought in a man, his will is indeclinably and inseparably fixed
   so to obedience as not to fall off from God. This is the foundation
   that he lays of the doctrine of the perseverance of saints, that it is
   a gift of God, and that such a gift as he effectually and actually
   works in him on whom he doth bestow it; -- a foundation that will by no
   means regularly bear the hay and stubble wherewith men think to build
   up a doctrine of perseverance, making it a fruit that may or may not be
   brought forth, from our own use of the means allowed for that end and
   purpose. And, indeed, the asserting of the perseverance of the saints
   in that way is as bad (if not a worse and more fearful) opposition to,
   and slighting of, the grace of God, as the denial of it in the way they
   oppose. By the latter they oppose the grace of God, by the former set
   up the power and strength of their own will. Thus far Austin is clearly
   engaged with us, that perseverance is a gift of God, that it is given
   by him to every one that doth persevere, and that every one to whom it
   is given is inseparably confirmed in grace, and shall infallibly
   persevere to the end.

   In that earnest and long contest which that learned doctor insists
   upon, to prove perseverance to be the gift of God (for which he hath
   sufficient ground from that of the apostle, 1 Cor. i. 7, 8, "That ye
   come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ," etc.), two things he especially aimed at:-- First, An opposing
   of such a perseverance as should not be the fruit and work of the grace
   of God in us, but the work and effect of our own endeavours, upon a
   supply of such means, motives, persuasions, and considerations, as we
   are or may be furnished withal. Secondly, That it is so given and
   bestowed, as that on whomsoever it is bestowed, he certainly hath it;
   that is, he doth certainly persevere. As it was heresy to that holy man
   to deny perseverance to be the gift of God, so it was ridiculous to him
   to say that that gift was given to any, and yet that they received it
   not; that is, that they might not persevere. "Nobis," saith he, De
   Correp. et Grat., cap. xi., "qui Christo insiti sumus, talis data est
   gratia, ut non solum poasimus si velimus, sed etiam ut velimus in
   Christo perseverare." And cap. xii., "Non solum ut sine illo dono
   perseverantes esse non possint, verum etiam ut per hoc donum non nisi
   perseverantes sint."

   And that which he adds afterward is most considerable, concluding from
   that of our Saviour, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and
   ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit." "Eis," saith
   he, "non solum justitiam, verum etiam in illa perseverantiam dedisse
   monstravit. Christo enim sic eos ponente ut eant et fructum afferant,
   et fructus eorum maneat, quis audeat dicere Forsitan non manebunt?'?"
   Though they dare say so who also dare to pretend his authority for what
   they say! -- how falsely, how unjustly, is evident to all serious
   observers of his mind and spirit in and about the things of the grace
   of God.

   2. As he mentioned perseverance to be such a gift of God as
   indeclinably wrought in them on whom it was bestowed a will to
   persevere, and on that account perseverance itself (an assertion as
   obnoxious to the calumny and clamour of the adversaries of the doctrine
   under consideration as any we teach or affirm concerning it), so he
   farther constantly taught this gift and grace to be a fruit of
   predestination or election, and to be bestowed on all and only elected
   believers. So De Predestinatione Sanc., cap. xvii., "Hæc dona Dei
   dantur electis, secundum Dei propositum vocatis, in quibus est et
   incipere et credere, et in fide ad hujus vitæ exitum perseverare." And
   afterward, cap. ix. De Bono Persev. "Ex duobus piis" (of his meaning in
   that word afterward), "cur huic donetur perseverantia, usque in finem,
   illi non donetur, inscrutabilia sunt judicia Dei: illud tamen fidelibus
   debet esse certissimum, hunc esse ex prædestinatis, illum non esse: Nam
   si fuissent ex nobis' (ait unus prædestinatorum qui e pectore Domini
   biberat hoc secretum) mansissent utique nobiscum.' ... Quæ est ista
   discretio? Patent libri Dei, non avertamus aspectum, clamat Scriptura
   Divina, adhibeamus auditum, non erant ex eis, quia non erant secundum
   propesitum vocati: non erant in Christo electi ante mundi
   constitutionem, non erant in eo sortem consecuti, non erant
   prædestinati secundum propositum ejus qui omnia operatur." And unto
   these elect, predestinate believers, he concluded still that
   perseverance was so given in and for Christ, so proceeding from the
   immutable will of God, wrought by such an efficacy of grace, that it
   was impossible that they should not persevere. He compares it farther
   with the grace that Adam received: Lib. de Correp. et Grat., cap. xii.,
   "Primo itaque homini, qui in eo bono quo factus fuerat rectus,
   acceperat posse non peccare, posse non mori, posse ipsum bonum non
   deserere, datum est adjutorium perseverantiæ, non quo fieret ut
   perseveraret, sed sine quo per liberum arbitrium perseverare non
   posset. Nunc vero sanctis in regnum Dei per gratiam Dei prædestinatis,
   non tantum tale adjutorium perseverantiæ datur; sed tale, ut iis
   perseverantia ipsa donetur, non solum ut sine isto dono perseverantes
   esse non possint, verum etiam ut per hoc donum non nisi perseverantes
   sint." And a little after: "Ipse itaque dat perseverantiam, qui
   stabilire potens est eos qui stant, ut perseverantissime stent." And in
   the 8th chapter of the same book, expounding that of our Saviour, Luke
   xxii. 32, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not," he
   manifesteth how, upon that account, it was impossible that the will of
   Peter should not actually be established to the end in believing. His
   words are, "An audebis dicere, etiam rogante Christo ne deficeret fides
   Petri, defecturam fuisse, si Petrus eam deficere voluisset, idque si
   eam usque in finem perseverare noluisset? Quasi aliud Petrus ullo modo
   vellet, quam pro illo Christus rogasset ut vellet: nam quis ignorat
   tunc fuisse perituram fidem Petri, si ea quæ fidelis erat voluntas ipsa
   deficeret; et permansuram, si voluntas eadem permaneret? Quando ergo
   oravit ne fides ejus deficeret, quid aliud rogavit, nisi ut haberet in
   fide liberrimam, fortissimam, invictissimam, perseverantissimam
   voluntatem?" And in this persuasion he had not only the consent of all
   the sound and orthodox doctors in his time, as was before manifested,
   but he is followed also by the schoolmen of all ages, and not forsaken
   by some of the Jesuits themselves, as we shall afterward see, when we
   have added that consideration of the doctrine of this learned man which
   hath given occasion to some to pretend his consent in opposition to
   that which most evidently he not only delivered but confirmed. There
   are in Austin, and those that either joined with him or followed
   immediately after him (notwithstanding the doctrine formerly insisted
   on, that actual perseverance is a gift of God, and that it flows from
   predestination, as an effect thereof, and is bestowed on all elect
   believers, infallibly preserving them unto the end, -- wherein they
   assert and strongly prove the whole of what we maintain), sundry
   expressions, commonly urged by the adversaries of the truth in hand,
   granting many who were saints, believing and regenerate, to fall away
   and perish for ever. I need not instance in any of their sayings to
   this purpose; the reader knows where to find them gathered to his hand,
   in Vossius, Grotius, and Mr Goodwin, from them. The seeming
   contradiction that is amongst themselves in the delivery of this
   doctrine will easily admit of a reconciliation, may they be allowed the
   common courtesy of being interpreters of their own meaning. What weight
   in those days was laid upon the participation of the sacramental
   figures of grace, and what expressions are commonly used concerning
   them who had obtained that privilege, are known to all. Hence all
   baptized persons, continuing in the profession of the faith and
   communion of the church, they called, counted, esteemed truly
   regenerate and justified, and spake so of them. Such as these they
   constantly affirmed might fall away into everlasting destruction; but
   yet what their judgment was concerning their present state indeed, even
   then when they so termed them regenerate and believers, in respect to
   the sacraments of those graces, Austin in sundry places clearly
   delivers his thoughts, to the undeceiving of all that are willing to be
   free. This he especially handles in his book De Correp. et Grat., cap.
   ix. "Non erant," saith he, "filii, etiam quando erant in professione et
   nomine filiorum; non quia justitiam simulaverunt, sed quia in ea non
   permanserunt." This righteousness he esteemed not to be merely feigned
   and hypocritical, but rather such as might truly entitle them to the
   state and condition of the children of God, in the sense before
   expressed.

   And again, "Isti cum pie vivunt dicuntur filii Dei, sed quoniam victuri
   sunt impie, et in eadem impietate morituri, non eos dicit filios Dei
   præscientia Dei." And farther in the same chapter, "Sunt rursus quidam
   qui filii Dei propter susceptam temporalem gratiam dicuntur a nobis,
   nec sunt tamen Deo." And again, "Non erant in numero filiornm, etiam
   quando erant in fide filiorum." And, "Sicut non vere discipuli Christi,
   ita nec vere filii Dei fuerunt, etiam quando esse videbantur, et ira
   vocabantur." He concludes, "Appellamus ergo nos et electos Christi
   discipulos, et Dei filios, quos regeneratos" (that is, as to the
   sacramental sign of that grace), "pie vivere cernimus; sed tunc vere
   sunt quod appellantur, si manserint in eo propter quod sic appellantur.
   Si autem perseverantiam non habent, id est, in eo quod coeperunt esse
   non manent, non vere appellantur quod appellantur, et non sunt." As
   also, De Doct. Christiana, lib. iii. cap. xxxii., "Non est revera
   corpus Christi quod non erit cum illo in æternum."

   And these are the persons which Austin and those of the same judgment
   with him do grant that they may fall away, such as, upon the account of
   their baptismal entrance into the church, their pious, devout lives,
   their profession of the faith of the gospel, they called and accounted
   regenerate believers; of whom yet they tell you, upon a thorough search
   into the nature and causes of holiness, grace, and walking with God,
   that they would be found not to be truly and really in that state and
   condition that they were esteemed to be in; of which they thought this
   a sufficient demonstration, even because they did not persevere: which
   undeniably, on the other hand (with the testimonies foregoing, and the
   like innumerable that might be produced), evinces that their constant
   judgment was, that all who are truly, really, and in the sight of God,
   believers, ingrafted into Christ, and adopted into his family, should
   certainly persevere; and that all the passages usually cited out of
   this holy and learned man, to persuade us that he ever cast an eye
   towards the doctrine of the apostasy of the saints, may particularly be
   referred to this head, and manifested that they do not at all concern
   those whom he esteemed saints indeed, which is clear from the
   consideration of what hath been insisted on. Thus far he, of whom what
   were the thoughts of the church of God in the days wherein he lived
   hath been declared; he who hath been esteemed, amongst the
   ecclesiastical writers of old, to have laboured more, and to more
   purpose, in the doctrine of the grace of God, than all that went before
   him, or any that have followed after him; whose renown in the church
   hath been chiefly upheld and maintained upon the account of the blessed
   pains and labours, wherein the presence of God made him to excel, for
   the depressing the pride of all flesh, and the exaltation of the riches
   of God's love, and efficacy of his grace in Jesus Christ, wherewith the
   whole church in succeeding ages hath been advantaged beyond what is
   easy to be expressed.

   That Prosper, Hilary, Fulgentius, and the men of renown in the
   congregation of God at the end of that age, did fall in with their
   judgments to that which Austin had delivered, I suppose will be easily
   confessed. Prosper, ad cap. vii. Gal.: "Quomodo eos habeat præordinata
   in Christo electio? cum dubium non sit donum Dei esse perseverantiam in
   bono usque ad finem; quod istos, ex eo ipso quod non perseverarunt, non
   habuisse manifestum est." Also, the breaking of the power and
   frustrating of the attempt of Pelagius by sundry doctors of the church,
   and synods to that end assembled (whereof Prosper gives us an account,
   reckoning them up in their order, and Austin before him, Epist. xlii.
   and xlvii., with special relation to what was done in Afric, and in the
   beginning of his verses, De Ingratis), with what troubles were raised
   and created anew to the champions of the grace of God by the writings
   of Cassianus, Faustus, Vincentius, the Massilienses, with some others
   in France, and the whole rabble of semi-Pelagians, with the fiction of
   Sigibert about a predestinarian heresy (whereof there was never any
   thing in being, no not among the Adrumentine monks, where Vossius hoped
   to have placed it), the council of Arles, the corruptions and
   falsifications of Faustus in the business of Lucidus, the impositions
   on Gotteschalcus, with the light given to that business from the
   Epistle of Florus, -- have exercised the commendable endeavours of so
   many already that there is not the least need farther to insist upon
   them. What entertainment that peculiar doctrine, which I am in the
   consideration of, found in the following ages is that which I shall
   farther demonstrate.

   After these was Gregory I., who, lib. i. Epist. xcix., speaks to the
   same purpose with them in these words: "Redemptor noster, Dei
   hominumque mediator, conditionis humanæ non immemor, sic imis summa
   conjungit, ut ipse in unitate permanens ita temporalia, occulto
   instinctu, pia consulens moderatione disponat, quatenus de ejus manu
   antiquus hostis nullatenus rapiat, quos ante secula intra sinum matris
   ecclesiæ adunandos esse præscivit; nam et si quisquam eorum inter quos
   degit, statibus motus ad tempus ut palmes titubet, radix tamen rectæ
   fidei, quæ ex occulto prodit, divino judicio virens manet, quæ accepto
   tempore fructum de se ostentare valeat, qui latebat." This is the sum
   of what we contend for, -- namely, that all those whom God hath
   predestinated to be added to the church, receiving a saving faith,
   though they may be shaken, yet on that account the root abides firm,
   their faith never utterly perisheth, but in due time brings forth
   accepted fruits again.

   And most expressive to our purpose is that discourse of his which you
   have, lib. xxxiv. Moral. cap. viii. Saith he, "Aurum, quod pravis
   diaboli persuasionibus quasi lutum sterni potuerit, aurum ante Dei
   oculos nunquam fuit, qui enim seduci quandoque non reversuri possunt,
   quasi habitam sanctitatem ante oculos hominum videntur amittere, sed
   eam ante oculos Dei nunquam habuerunt."

   The exclusion of those from being true believers who may be seduced and
   fall away doth most eminently infer the perseverance of all them who
   are so.

   Add unto these OEcumenius (though he be one of a later date), and these
   shall suffice for the period of time relating to the Pelagian
   controversy. Saith he, in Epist. ad Eph. cap. i. 14, Ho arrhabon
   pistoutai to holon; tina toinun huisthesian kai ta muria agatha
   pistoumenos ho Theos dedoken arrhabona tes epouraniou kleronomias to
   Hagion Pneuma. All is confirmed and ratified by the earnest of the
   Spirit, that is given to them that believe.

   Of those that lived after the days of the forementioned (I mean all of
   them but the last), that I may not cloy the reader, I shall not mention
   any, until the business of divinity and the profession of it was taken
   up by the schoolmen and canonists; who, from a mixture of divine and
   human principles, framed the whole body of it anew, and gave it over
   into the possession of the present Romish church, moulded for the most
   part to the worldly, carnal interests of them on whom they had their
   dependency in their several generations.

   But yet as there was none of those but, one way or other, was eminently
   conducing to the carrying on of the mystery of iniquity, by depraving,
   perverting, and corrupting, one truth or other of the gospel, so all of
   them did not in all things equally corrupt their ways, but gave some
   testimony more or less to some truths, as they received them from those
   that went before them. So fell it out in the matter of the grace of God
   and the corruption of the nature of man. Though some of them laboured
   to corrode and corrupt the ancient received doctrine thereof, so some,
   again, contended with all their might, in their way and by their
   arguments, to defend it; as is evident in the instance of Bradwardin
   crying out to God and man to help in the cause of God against the
   Pelagians in his days, in particular complaining of the great master of
   their divinity. So that notwithstanding all their corruptions, these
   ensuing principles passed currently amongst the most eminent of them as
   to the doctrine under consideration, which continue in credit with many
   of their sophistical successors to this day:--

   1. That perseverance is a grace of God, bestowed according to
   predestination, or election, on men; that is, that God gives it to
   believers that are predestinated and elected.

   2. That on whomsoever the grace of perseverance is bestowed, they do
   persevere to the end; and it is impossible in some sense that they
   should otherwise do.

   3. That none who are not predestinate, what grace soever they may be
   made partakers of in this world, shall constantly continue to the end.

   4. That no believer can by his own strength or power (incited or
   stirred up by what manlike or rational considerations soever) persevere
   in the faith, the grace of perseverance being a gift of God.

   It is true, that, their judgments being perverted by sundry other
   corrupt principles, about the nature and efficacy of sacraments, with
   their conveyance of grace "ex opere operato," and out of ignorance of
   the righteousness of God and the real work of regeneration, they
   generally maintain (though Bradwardin punctually expressed himself to
   be of another mind) that many persons not predestinate may come to
   believe, yet fall away and perish.

   Now, the truth is, it is properly no part of the controversy under
   consideration, whether, or how far, and in what sense, men, by reason
   of the profession and participation of ordinances, with the work and
   effect of common grace upon them, may be said to be true believers; but
   the whole, upon the matter of what we plead for, is comprised in the
   assertions now ascribed to them: which that it is done upon sufficient
   grounds will be manifest by calling in some few of the most eminent of
   them, to speak in their own words what their thoughts were in this
   matter.

   To bring them in, I desire that one who (though none of them) was
   eminent in his undertakings for a mixture of divinity and law, in those
   days wherein they had their eminent rise and original, may be heard;
   and that is Gratian, who after his manner hath collected many things to
   the purpose in hand. P. 2, c. 33, q. 3, De Poenit. Dist., can. 2,
   "Charitas," saith he, "est juncta Deo inseparabiliter, et unita, et in
   omnibus semper invicta." And, "Electi quippe sic ad bonum tendunt, ut
   ad mala perpetranda non redeant; et, potest discursus, et mobilitas
   spiritus sic intelligi. In sanctorum quippe cordibus juxta quasdam
   virtutes semper permanet; juxta quasdam vero recessurus venit, venturus
   recedit: in fide etenim, et spe, et charitate, et bonis aliis, sine
   quibus ad coelestem patriam non potest veniri (sicut est humilitas,
   castitas, justitia, atque misericordia) perfectorum corda non deserit:
   in prophetiæ vero virtute, doctrinæ facundia, miraculorum exhibitione,
   suls aliquando adest, aliquando se subtrahit." Answering the objection
   of the Spirit's departure from them on whom he is bestowed, he
   distinguisheth of the respects upon the account whereof he may be said
   so to do. "In respect of some common gifts," saith he, "he may withdraw
   himself from them on whom he is bestowed; but not in respect of
   habitual sanctifying grace."

   Among the schoolmen, there is none of greater name and eminency, for
   learning, devotion, and subtilty, than our Bradwardin, who was proctor
   of this university in the year 1325, and obtained by general consent
   the title of Doctor Profundus. Lib. ii., De Causa Dei, cap. viii., this
   profoundly learned doctor proposes this thesis, to be confirmed in the
   following chapter: "Quod nullus viator, quantacunque gratia creata
   subnixus, solius liberi arbitrii viribus, vel etiam cure adjutorio
   gratiæ, possit perseverare finaliter, sine alio Dei auxilio speciali."
   In the long disputation following, he disputes out of the Scriptures
   and ancient writers, abundantly cited to his purpose, that there is no
   possibility of the perseverance of any believer in the faith to the end
   upon such helps, considerations, and advantages, as Mr Goodwin
   proposeth as the only means thereof; that perseverance itself is a gift
   of God, without which gift and grace none can persevere. And the
   speciality of that grace he expresseth in the corollary wherewith he
   closeth the chapter, which is, "Quod nullus viator, solius liberi
   arbitrii, vel gratiæ viribus, aut amborum conjunctim, sine alio Dei
   auxilio speciali, potest perseverare per aliquod tempus omnino;"
   farther asserting the efficacy of special grace in and for every good
   work whatever. His arguments and testimonies I shall not need to
   recite; they are at hand to those who desire to consult them.

   After the vindication of the former thesis, cap. ix., x., xi., he
   proposeth farther this proposition, to a right understanding of the
   doctrine of perseverance: "Quod perseverantia non est aliquod donum Dei
   creatum, a charitate, et gratia realiter differens." And the corollary
   wherewith he shuts up that disputation is: "Quod nomen perseverantiæ
   nullam rem absolutam essentialiter significat, sed accidentaliter et
   relative; charitatem videlicet, sive justitiam cum respectu futuræ
   permansionis usque in finem, et quod non improbabiliter posset dici
   perseverantiam esse ipsam relationem hujus."

   After this, knowing well what conclusion would easily be inferred from
   these principles, -- namely, That perseverance is not really distinct
   from faith and love, that it is such a grace and gift of God that
   whosoever it is bestowed upon shall certainly persevere, namely, that
   every one who hath received true grace, faith and love, shall certainly
   persevere, -- he objects that to himself, and plainly grants it to be
   so indeed, cap. xii. And to make the matter more clear, cap. xiii., he
   disputes, that "Auxilium sine quo nullus perseverat, et per quod
   quilibet perseverat, est Spiritus Sanctus, divina bonitas et voluntas."
   Every cause of bringing sinful man to God is called by them "auxilium.'
   In these three, "Spiritus Sanctus, divina bonitas, et voluntas," he
   compriseth the chief causes of perseverance, as I have also done in the
   ensuing treatise. By "divina voluntas" he intends God's eternal and
   immutable decree, as he manifests, cap. viii., ix., whither he sends
   his reader; his "divina bonitas" is that free grace whereby God accepts
   and justifies us as his; "Spiritus Sanctus" is sanctification: so that
   he affirms the perseverance of the saints to consist in the stability
   of their acceptation with God, and continuance of their sanctification
   from him, upon the account of his unchangeable purposes and decrees;
   which is the sum of what we contend for.

   And this is part of the doctrine concerning the grace of God, and his
   sovereignty over the wills of men, which Bradwardin in his days cried
   out so earnestly for the defence of to God and man against the Pelagian
   encroachment, which was made upon it in those days. Thus he turns
   himself, in the conclusion of his book, to the pope and church of Rome,
   with zealous earnestness, for their interposition to the determination
   of these controversies. "Ut os inique loquentium," saith he,
   "obstruatur, flexis genibus cordis mei imploro ecclesiam, præcipue
   Romanam, quæ summa authoritate vigere dignoscitur, quatenus ipsa
   determinare dignetur, quid circa præmissas catholice sit tenendum. Non
   enim sine periculo in talibus erratur. Simon, dormis? exurge," speaking
   to the pope, "exime gladium, amputa quæque sinistra hæreticæ
   pravitatis, defende et protege catholicam veritatem. Porro etsi Dominus
   ipse in Petri navicula dormiat, nimietate tempestatis compulsus, ipsum
   quoque fiducialiter excitabo, quatenus Spiritus oris sui tempestate
   sedata tranquillum faciat et serenum. Absit autem, ut qui in prora
   hujus naviculæ pervigil laborabat, jam in puppi super cervicalia
   dormiat, vel dormitet," lib. iii. cap. liii.

   With this earnestness, above three hundred years ago, did this
   profoundly learned man press the popes to a determination of these
   controversies against the Pelagians and their successors in his
   schools. The same suit hath ever since been continued by very many
   learned men (in every age) of the communion of the church of Rome,
   crying out for the papal definitive sentence against the Pelagian
   errors crept into their church; especially hath this outcry with
   supplication been renewed by the Dominican friars, ever since the
   Jesuits have so cunningly gilded over that Pelagian poison, and set it
   out as the best and most wholesome food for "holy mother" and her
   children. Yea, with such earnestness hath this been in the last age
   pursued by agents in the court of Rome, that (a congregation de
   auxiliis being purposely appointed) it was generally supposed one while
   that they would have prevailed in their suit, and have obtained a
   definitive sentence on their side against their adversaries. But
   through the just vengeance of God upon a pack of bloody, persecuting
   idolaters, giving them up more and more to the belief of lies, contrary
   almost to the expectation of all men, this very year, 1653, Pope
   Innocent X., who now wears the triple crown, conjured by the subtlety
   and dreadful interest of the Jesuits in all nations that as yet wonder
   after him, by a solemn bull, or papal consistorian determination, in
   the case of Jansenius, bishop of Ypres, hath turned the scales upon his
   first suppliants, and cast the cause on the Pelagian side. But of that
   whole business elsewhere.

   I shall not perplex the reader with the horrid names of Trombet,
   Hilcot, Bricot, Sychet, Tartaret, Brulifer, nor with their more horrid
   terms and expressions. Let the one Angelical Doctor [i.e., Aquinas]
   answer for the rest of his companions.

   That this man, then (one of the great masters of the crew), abode by
   the principles of him before insisted on, may quickly be made evident
   by some few instances clearing his judgment herein.

   This, in the first place, he everywhere insists on, that no habitual
   grace received, no improvement that can be made of it, by the utmost
   ability, diligence, and the most raised considerations of the best of
   men, will cause any one certainly to persevere, without the peculiar
   preservation of God. Of this he gives his reason, lib. iii. Contra
   Gent. Ca. 155, "Illud quod natura sun est variabile, ad hoc, quod
   figatur in uno, indiget auxilio alicujus moventis immobilis; sed
   liberum arbitrium etiam existentis in gratia habituali adhuc manet
   variabile, et flexibile a bono in malum; ergo ad hoc, quod figatur in
   bono et perseveret in illo, usque ad finem, indiget speciali Dei
   auxilio." An argument this of the same importance with that mentioned
   out of Bradwardin; which, howsoever at first appearance it may seem to
   lie at the outskirts of the controversy in hand, yet indeed is such as,
   being granted, hath an influence into the whole, as hath been
   manifested.

   And this the same author farther confirms. Saith he, pp. q. 109, a. 9,
   "Cum nullum agens secundum agat nisi in virtute primi, sitque caro
   spiritui perpetuo rebellis; non potest homo licet jam gratiam
   consecutus, per seipsum operari bonum, et vitare peccatum, absque novo
   auxilio Dei, ipsum moventis, dirigentis, et protegentis; quamvis alia
   habitualis gratia ad hoc ei necessaria non sit." And the reasons he
   gives of this conclusion in the body of the article are considerable.
   This, saith he, must be so, "Primo quidem, ratione generali propter
   hoc, quod nulla res creata potest in quemcunque actum prodire, nisi
   virtute motionis divinæ." The Pelagian self-sufficiency and exemption
   from dependence "in solidum" upon God, both providentially and
   physically as to operation, was not so freely received in the schools
   as afterward. "Secundo," saith he, "ratione speciali, propter
   conditionem status humanæ naturæ, quæ quidem licet per gratiam sanetur,
   quantum ad mentem, remanet tamen in eo corruptio, et infectio quantum
   ad carnem, per quam servit legi peccati, ut dicitur, Rom. vii. Remanet
   etiam quædam ignorantiæ obscuritas in intellectu, secundum quam (ut
   etiam dicitur, Rom. viii. quid oremus sicut oportet nescimus:' ideo
   necesse est nobis, ut a Deo dirigamur et protegamur, qui omnia novit,
   et omnia potest." And will not this man, think you, in his gropings
   after light, when darkness covered the face of the earth, and thick
   darkness was upon the inhabitants thereof, with this his discovery, --
   of the impotency of the best of the saints for perseverance upon the
   account of any grace received, because of the perpetual powerful
   rebellion of indwelling lust and corruption, and that all that do
   persevere are preserved by the power of God unto salvation, -- rise in
   judgment against those who in our days, wherein the Sun of
   Righteousness is risen with healing under his wings, do ascribe a
   sufficiency unto men in themselves, upon the bottom of their rational
   considerations, to abide with God, or persevere to the end?

   And this assertion of the Angelical Doctor is notably confirmed by
   Didacus Alvarez in his vindication of it from the exception of Medina,
   that we make use of habits when we will, and if men will make use of
   their habitual grace, they may persevere without relation to any after
   grace of God. Saith he, "Respondetur, habitibus quidem nos uti cum
   volumus, sed ut velimus illis uti, prærequiritur motio Dei efficax,
   præmovens liberum arbitrium, ut utatur habitu ad operandum, et operetur
   bonum, præsertim quando habitus sunt supernaturales; quia cum
   pertineant ad superiorem ordinem, habent specialem rationem, propter
   quam potentia mere naturalis non utitur eisdem habitibus, nisi speciali
   Dei auxilio moveatur," Alvar. De Aux. lib. x. disput. 100. Though
   received graces are reckoned by him as supernatural habits, yet such as
   we act not by, nor with, but from new supplies from God.

   Having laid down this principle, Thomas proceeds to manifest that there
   is a special grace of perseverance bestowed by God on some, and that on
   whomsoever it is bestowed, they certainly and infallibly persevere to
   the end, pp. quest. 109, a. 10, c.; and Contra Gent. lib. iii., he
   proves this assertion from p. 6, 1 Pet. v. 10; Ps. xvi.

   But, to spare the reader, I shall give you this man's judgment,
   together with one of his followers, who hath had the happiness to clear
   his master's mind above any that have undertaken the maintenance of his
   doctrine in that part now controverted in the church of Rome; and
   therein I shall manifest (what I formerly proposed) what beamings and
   irradiations of this truth do yet glide, through that gross darkness
   which is spread upon the face of the Romish synagogue; -- referring
   what I have farther to add on this head to the account which, God
   assisting, I shall ere long give of the present Jansenian
   controversies, in my considerations on Mr Biddle's catechisms, a task
   by authority lately imposed on me. This is Didacus Alvarez, whose 10th
   book De Auxiliis treats peculiarly of this subject of perseverance. In
   the entrance of his disputation, he lays down the same principles with
   the former concerning the necessity of the peculiar grace of
   perseverance, to the end that any one may persevere, disp. 103.

   Then, disp. 108, he farther manifests that this gift or grace of
   perseverance does not depend on any conditions in us, or any
   co-operation of our wills. His position he lays down in these words:
   "Donum perseverantiæ, in ratione doni perseverantiæ, et efficacia
   illius, nullo modo dependet effective ex libera co-operatione nostri
   arbitrii, sed a solo Deo, atque ab efficacia, et absoluto decreto
   voluntatis ejus, qui pro sua misericordia tribuit illud donum cui
   vult." In the farther proof of this proposition, he manifests by clear
   testimonies that the contrary doctrine hereunto was that of the
   Pelagians and semi-Pelagians, which Austin opposed in sundry treatises.
   And in all the arguments whereby he farther confirms it, he still
   presses the absurdity of making the promise of God concerning
   perseverance conditional, and so suspending it on any thing in and by
   us to be performed. And, indeed, all the acts whereby we persevere
   flowing, according to him, from the grace of perseverance, it cannot
   but be absurd to make the efficient cause in its efficiency and
   operation to depend upon its own effect. This also is with him
   ridiculous, that the grace of perseverance should be given to any and
   he not persevere, or be promised and yet not given; yet withal he
   grants, in his following conclusions, that our wills, secondarily and
   in dependency, do co-operate in our perseverance.

   The second principle this learned schoolman insists on is, that this
   gift of perseverance is peculiar to the elect, or predestinate: Disput.
   104, 1, Con. "Donum perseverantiæ est proprium prædestinatorum, ut
   nulli alteri conveniat." And what he intends by "prædestinati," he
   informs you according to the judgment of Austin and Thomas: "Nomine
   prædestinationis ad gloriam, solum eam prædestinationem intelligunt
   (Augustinus et Thomas) qua electi ordinantur efficaciter, et
   transmittuntur ad vitam æternam; cujus effectus sunt vocatio,
   justificatio, et perseverantia in gratia usque ad finem." Not that (or
   such a) conditional predestination as is pendent in the air, and
   expectant of men's good final deportment; but that which is the
   eternal, free fountain of all that grace whereof in time by Jesus
   Christ we are made partakers.

   And in the pursuit of this proposition, he farther proves at large that
   the perseverance given to the saints in Christ is not a supplement of
   helps and advantages, whereby they may preserve it if they will, but
   such as causes them on whom it is bestowed certainly and actually so to
   do; and that, in its efficacy and operation, it cannot depend on any
   free co-operation of our wills, all the good acts tending to our
   perseverance being fruits of that grace which is bestowed on us,
   according to the absolute unchangeable decree of the will of God.

   This, indeed, is common with this author and the rest of his associates
   (the Dominicans and present Jansenians) in these controversies,
   together with the residue of the Romanists, that having their judgments
   wrested by the abominable figments of implicit faith, and the efficacy
   of the sacraments of the new testament, conveying, and really
   exhibiting, the grace signified or sealed by them, they are enforced to
   grant that many may be, and are, regenerated and made true believers
   who are not predestinated, and that these cannot persevere, nor shall
   eventually be saved. Certain it is, that there is not any truth which
   that generation of men do receive and admit, but more or less it
   suffers in their hands, from that gross ignorance of the free grace of
   God in Jesus Christ, the power whereof they are practically under. What
   the poor vassals and slaves will do upon the late bull of their holy
   father, casting them in sundry main concernments of their quarrel with
   their adversaries, is uncertain. Otherwise, setting aside some such
   deviations as the above mentioned, whereunto they are enforced by their
   ignorance of the grace and justification which is in Jesus Christ,
   there is so much of ancient candid truth, in opposition to the
   Pelagians and semi-Pelagians, preserved and asserted in the writings of
   the Dominican friars, as will rise up, as I said before, in judgment
   against those of our days who, enjoying greater light and advantages,
   do yet close in with those, and are long since cursed enemies of the
   grace of God.

   To this Dominican I shall only add the testimony of two famous Jesuits,
   upon whose understandings the light of this glorious truth prevailed,
   for an acknowledgment of it. The first of these is Bellarmine, whose
   disputes to this purpose being full and large, and the author in all
   men's hands, shall not transcribe his assertions and arguments; but
   only refer the reader to his lib. ii., De Grat. et Lib. Arbit. cap.
   xii., "Denique ut multa alia testimonia," etc. The other is Suarez, who
   delivers his thoughts succinctly upon the whole of this matter. Lib.
   xi. De Perpetuitat. vel Amis. Grat. cap. ii., sect. 6, saith he, "De
   prædestinatis verum est infallibiliter, quod gratiam finaliter seu in
   perpetuum non amittunt; unde postquam semel gratiam habuerant, ita
   reguntur et proteguntur a Deo, ut vel non cadant, vel si ceciderint
   resurgant; et licet sæpius cadant et resurgant, tandem aliquando ita
   resurgunt ut amplius non cadant." In which few words he hath briefly
   comprised the sum of that which is by us contended for.

   It was in my thoughts in the last place to have added the concurrent
   witness of all the reformed churches, with that of the most eminent
   divines, which have written in the defence of their concessions, but
   this trouble, upon second consideration, I shall spare the reader and
   myself; for as many other reasons lie against the prosecuting of this
   design, so especially the uselessness of spending time and pains for
   the demonstration of a thing of so evident a truth prevails with me to
   desist. Notwithstanding the endeavours of Mr Goodwin to wrest the words
   of some of the most ancient writers who laboured in the first
   reformation of the churches, I presume no unprejudiced person in the
   least measure acquainted with the system of that doctrine which, with
   so much pains, diligence, piety, and learning, they promoted in the
   world, with the clearness of their judgments in going forth to the
   utmost compass of their principles which they received, and their
   constancy to themselves in asserting of the truths they embraced, --
   owned by their friends and adversaries until such time as Mr Goodwin
   discovered their self-contradictions, -- will scarce be moved once to
   question their judgments by the excerpts of Mr Goodwin, chap. xv. of
   his treatise; so that of this discourse this is the issue.

   There remains only that I give a brief account of some concernments of
   the ensuing treatise, and dismiss the reader from any farther
   attendance in the porch or entrance thereof.

   The title of the book speaks of the aim and method of it. The
   confutation of Mr Goodwin was but secondarily in my eye; and the best
   way for that I judged to consist in a full scriptural confirmation of
   the truth he opposed. That I chiefly intended; and therein I hope the
   pious reader may, through the grace of God, meet with satisfaction. In
   my undertaking to affirm the truth of what I assert, the thing itself
   first, and then the manifestation of it, were in my consideration. For
   the thing itself, my arguing hath been to discover the nature of it,
   its principles and causes, its relation to the good-will of the Father,
   the mediation of the Son, and dispensation of the Holy Ghost to the
   saints thereupon; and its use and tendency in and unto that fellowship
   with the Father and the Son whereunto we are called and admitted.

   As to the manner of its revelation, the proper seats of it in the book
   of God, the occasion of the delivery thereof in several seasons, the
   significant expressions wherein it is set forth, and the receiving of
   it by them to whom it was revealed, have been diligently remarked.

   In those parts of the discourse which tend to the vindication of the
   arguments from Scripture whereby the truth pleaded for is confirmed, of
   the usefulness of the thing itself contended about, etc., I have been,
   I hope, careful to keep my discourse from degenerating into jangling
   and strife of words (the usual issue of polemical writings), being not
   altogether ignorant of the devices of Satan, and the usual carnal
   attendancies of such proceedings. The weight of the truth in hand, the
   common interest of all the saints in their walking with God therein,
   sense of my own duty, and the near approach of the account which I must
   make of the ministration to me committed, have given bounds and limits
   to my whole discourse, as to the manner of handling the truth therein
   asserted. Writing in the common language of the nation about the common
   possession of the saints, the meanest and weakest as well as the wisest
   and the most learned, labouring in the work of Christ and his gospel, I
   durst not hide the understanding of what I aimed at by mingling the
   plain doctrine of the Scripture with metaphysical notions, expressions
   of art, or any pretended ornaments of wit or fancy; because I fear God.
   For the more sublime consideration of things, and such a way of their
   delivery as, depending upon the acknowledged reception of sundry arts
   and sciences, which the generality of Christians neither are nor need
   to be acquainted withal, scholars may communicate their thoughts and
   apprehensions unto and among themselves, and that upon the stage of the
   world, in that language whereunto they have consented for and to that
   end and purpose. That I have carefully abstained from personal
   reflections, scoffs, undervaluations, applications of stories and old
   sayings, to the provocation of the spirit of them with whom I have to
   do, I think not at all praiseworthy, because, upon a review of some
   passages in the treatise (now irrecoverable), I fear I have scarce been
   so careful as I am sure it was my duty to have been.

   To remove from the preceding preface the appearance of confusion which
   it presents, it is enough to remark, that in the course of citing
   testimonies in proof that his views on the subject of the perseverance
   of the saints had the sanction of antiquity, Owen, after a passing blow
   at the Clementine Constitutions, proceeds not only to impugn the
   integrity of the Ignatian Epistles, but to assail the reasonings of Dr
   Hammond in support of Episcopacy. On the former point, admitting
   generally that the documents known by the name of the Epistles of
   Ignatius might contain much that was the production of that early
   martyr, Owen represents them as so adulterated that no valid inference
   can be drawn from their contents. His reasons are, that high
   authorities, such as Vedelius, who brought out the Genevan edition of
   them, Calvin, De Saumaise, Blondel, the Magdeburg Centuriators, and
   Whitaker, had pronounced much of them to be spurious; that they
   contained passages from the Clementine Constitutions, a forgery, and of
   a date subsequent to the age of Ignatius; that the passages quoted from
   them by Theodoret and Jerome do not accord with, or rather do not exist
   in, the version of them extant; that the style of them is replete with
   turgid expressions, inconsistent with the simplicity of the early
   Christian writers; that Latin words occur in them, not likely to be
   employed by a Syrian like Ignatius; and that they contain expressions
   of overweening deference to the hierarchy, a species of government not
   in existence in the time of Ignatius. On such grounds, our author holds
   that these epistles resemble those children of the Jews by their
   strange wives, who "spake part the language of Ashdod, and part the
   language of the Jews."

   No doubt exists that Ignatius was the author of some epistles warning
   the church of his day against heretical opinions, which had begun to
   disturb its unity and peace; and early fathers of the church, Polycarp,
   Irenæus, Theophilus of Antioch, Origen, and Eusebius, make specific
   allusion to these epistles. The question is, What epistles are to be
   regarded as the genuine writings of Ignatius among three different
   collections purporting to be such; first, twelve epistles in Greek and
   Latin, with a long and expanded text; secondly, eleven epistles in
   Greek and Latin, of which seven are in a shorter text; and lastly, the
   three epistles in Syriac published by Mr Cureton, of which the text is
   shorter even than that of the last-mentioned collection?

   From the strong support which many expressions in the first and second
   of these recensions lend to the hierarchical element in
   church-government, these documents were of importance in the
   controversy between Presbyterians and Episcopalians. While the text was
   yet unsettled, and different editions were issuing from the press, --
   one by Vedelius in 1623, giving seven Greek epistles, corresponding in
   name to those mentioned by Eusebius; another by Usher in 1644; another
   by Vossius in 1646, giving eight epistles, with part of a ninth,
   founded on a manuscript discovered at Florence, and hence, designated
   the Medicean Greek text, -- certain writers, such as Claude de Saumaise
   (1641) and Blondel (1646), laboured to prove that these epistles bore
   traces of an age posterior to Ignatius. Dr Hammond (1651), in four
   dissertations, replied to them, defending the genuineness of the
   epistles, and episcopal government. It is in answer to this last work
   that Owen wrote the animadversions which form the digression in his
   preface to his work on the Perseverance of the Saints. Hammond
   published a rejoinder, in his "Answer to Animadversions on the
   Dissertations touching Ignatius' Epistles," etc.

   The most important contributions to this controversy followed, and with
   them for a time it ceased. Daillé, in 1666, published a learned work,
   designed, according to the title-page, to prove three things, -- that
   the epistles were spurious, that they were written after the time of
   Ignatius, and that they were of no higher authority than "The Cardinal
   Works of Christ," a production commonly inserted among the remains of
   Cyprian. In 1672, Pearson, afterwards bishop of Chester published his
   "Vindiciæ Epistolarum S. Ignatii," -- long deemed conclusive by those
   who were in favour of the genuineness of the epistles, in spite of an
   able anonymous reply by Larroque in 1674, and the doubts that continued
   to be felt by many scholars who had made the epistles the subject of
   keen and critical investigation.

   From this point no advance was made in the discussion, some authors
   contending for the long recension and some for the shorter, till the
   conjecture of Usher respecting the probability of a Syriac manuscript
   was verified, by the discovery of a Syriac version of the Epistle to
   Polycarp among some ancient manuscripts, procured by Archdeacon Tattam,
   in 1838 or 1839, from a monastery in the Desert of Nitria. Mr Cureton,
   who discovered the epistle among these manuscripts, set on foot a new
   search for other manuscripts. The result was, that the archdeacon, by a
   second expedition to Egypt, brought home in 1843 three entire epistles
   in Syriac, to Polycarp, to the Ephesians, and to the Romans. M. Pacho
   secured possession of another copy in 1847, which afterwards came under
   the examination of Mr Cureton.

   It is the opinion of Mr Cureton and Chevalier Bunsen that these three
   Syriac epistles are the only genuine writings of Ignatius; -- because
   the Syriac manuscript, transcribed most probably before a.d. 550, is of
   greater antiquity than any existing Greek manuscripts; -- the epistles
   in Syriac are shorter than the same epistles as published by Usher in
   the Medicean text, while the sense comes out more clearly, from the
   omission of the parts found only in the Greek manuscripts; -- passages
   in the latter, to which objections have been urged, as containing
   allusions to heresies (Valentinianism, for example) subsequent to the
   time of Ignatius, and sentences insisting on a superstitious deference
   to the hierarchy, do not appear in the Syriac; from which it would
   follow, either that these passages are spurious, and inserted since the
   time of the Syriac translator, or that he anticipated the objections of
   modern criticism, and confirmed them as just by deleting these
   passages; -- there is perfect uniformity in the style of so much of
   these epistles in Greek as corresponds with the three Syriac epistles,
   while the discrepancy of style existing in the Greek recensions between
   the Epistle to Polycarp and the rest, the difference of matter in the
   Epistle to the Romans (in the Greek six times longer than in the
   Syriac), and the peculiar complexion of two chapters in the Epistle to
   the Trallians, transferred, as it now appears, from the Epistle to the
   Romans, had all been noticed previous to the discovery of the Syriac
   manuscripts, and had thrown an air of suspicion over all the epistles;
   -- and the three epistles in the Syriac collection are the only
   epistles for which the evidence of antiquity, in the shape of
   testimonies and allusions in the writings of the early fathers, can be
   cited for upwards of two centuries after the death of Ignatius.

   On the other hand, it has been argued that the Syriac version is
   probably an epitome of the Greek epistles; that such abridgments were
   common in ancient times; that the scope and sense is more clear in the
   Greek than in the Syriac; that a manuscript printed by Mr Cureton is a
   Syriac abridgment of these epistles, differing from that of the three
   considered by him to be genuine; that the events and opinions which
   seem to indicate a later age than that of the martyr may be explained
   by reference to his age; that in the third century quotations are found
   from all the epistles; and that Eusebius expressly names and describes
   seven epistles, a testimony repeated by Jerome.

   At present the amount of evidence seems in favour of the three Syriac
   epistles, as all the genuine remains of Ignatius we possess. It is
   possible that. Syriac manuscripts of the other epistles may be
   discovered, although the claim of the former to be not only paramount
   but exclusive has been argued with great force, on the ground that had
   the latter existed, they would certainly have been the subject of
   appeal in many controversies by many fathers who utterly ignore them,
   as well as from the closing words of the recently discovered
   manuscripts, "Here end the three epistles of Ignatius, bishop and
   martyr." Meanwhile it is satisfactory to know that the Syriac version
   leaves the argument for the authenticity and genuineness of the
   Scriptures very nearly where it stood. It contains references to two of
   the Gospels, to the Acts of the Apostles, and to five of Paul's
   Epistles. Both the Epistles of Ignatius to the Ephesians and to the
   Romans, in the Syriac version, assert distinctly the Godhead of Christ.

   But how fares the question of ecclesiastical polity, -- the point which
   brought these epistles into dispute between Owen and Hammond, -- by the
   discovery of the Syriac manuscript? All the passages in favour of the
   hierarchy disappear in it, except the following from the Epistle to
   Polycarp, "Look to the bishop, that God also may look upon you. I will
   be instead of the souls of those who are subject to the bishop, and the
   presbyters, and the deacons." Are we to say here, like Neander in
   reference to all the Greek epistles, with the exception of the one to
   the Romans, which he admitted to possess greater marks of originality
   than the others, "a hierarchical purpose is not to be mistaken," to
   pronounce it an interpolation or challenge the authenticity of the
   Syriac document? or are we to admit its genuineness, and accept it as
   evidence that Episcopacy dates so early as the time of Ignatius? or are
   we to question the import of the term "bishop," so as to make it
   quadrate with Congregational or Presbyterian views? But these
   questions, while they illustrate the present state of the controversy,
   are beyond our province. -- Ed.

   it, cleared from Isa. iv. -- That chapter opened -- The 5th verse
   particularly insisted on and discussed -- The whole state and method of
   the controversy thence educed.

   The truth which I have proposed to handle, and whose defence I have
   undertaken in the ensuing discourse, is commonly called the
   perseverance of saints; a doctrine whereof nothing ordinary, low, or
   common, is spoken by any that have engaged into the consideration of
   it. To some it is the very salt of the covenant of grace, the most
   distinguishing mercy communicated in the blood of Christ, so interwoven
   into, and lying at the bottom of, all that consolation which "God is
   abundantly willing that all the heirs of the promise should receive,"
   that it is utterly impossible it should be safe-guarded one moment
   without a persuasion of this truth, which seals up all the mercy and
   grace of the new covenant with the unchangeableness and faithfulness of
   God. [8] To others it is no grace of God, no part of the purchase of
   Christ, no doctrine of the gospel, no foundation of consolation; but an
   invention of men, a delusion of Satan, an occasion of dishonour to God,
   disconsolation and perplexity to believers, a powerful temptation unto
   sin and wickedness in all that do receive it. [9]

   A doctrine it is, also, whose right apprehension is on all hands
   confessed to be of great importance, upon the account of that effectual
   influence which it hath, and will have, into our walking with God; --
   which, say some, is to love humility, thankfulness, fear, fruitfulness;
   [10] to folly, stubbornness, rebellion, dissoluteness, negligence, say
   others. The great confidence expressed by men concerning the evidence
   and certainty of their several persuasions, whether defending or
   opposing the doctrine under consideration, -- the one part professing
   the truth thereof to be of equal stability with the promises of God,
   and most plentifully delivered in the Scripture; others (at least one,
   who is thought to be pars magna of his companions), that if it be
   asserted in any place of the Scripture, it were enough to make wise and
   impartial men to call the authority thereof into question, -- must
   needs invite men to turn aside to see about what this earnest contest
   is. And quis is est tam potens, who dares thus undertake to remove not
   only ancient landmarks and boundaries of doctrines among the saints,
   but "mountains of brass" and the "hills about Jerusalem," which we
   hoped would stand fast for ever? The concernment, then, of the glory of
   God, and the honour of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the interest of the
   souls of the saints, being so wrapped up, and that confessedly on all
   hands, in the doctrine proposed, I am not out of hope that the plain
   discoursing of it from the word of truth may be as "a word in season,"
   like "apples of gold in pictures of silver."

   Moreover, besides the general importance of that doctrine in all times
   and seasons, the wretched practices of many in the days wherein we
   live, and the industrious attempts of others in their teachings, for
   the subverting and casting it down from its excellency and that place
   which it hath long held in the churches of Christ and hearts of all the
   saints of God, have rendered the consideration of it at this time
   necessary.

   For the first, these are days wherein we have as sad and tremendous
   examples of apostasy, backsliding, and falling from high and glorious
   pitches in profession, as any age can parallel; -- as many stars cast
   from heaven, as many trees plucked up by the roots, as many stately
   buildings, by wind, rain, and storm, cast to the ground, as many sons
   of perdition discovered, as many washed swine returning to their mire,
   as many Demases going after the present evil world, and men going out
   from the church which were never truly and properly of it, as many sons
   of the morning and children of high illumination and gifts setting in
   darkness, and that of all sorts, as ever in so short a space of time
   since the name of Christ was known upon the earth. [11] What through
   the deviating of some to the ways of the world and the lusts of the
   flesh, what of others to spiritual wickednesses and abominations, it is
   seldom that we see a professor to hold out in the glory of his
   profession to the end. I shall not now discourse of the particular
   causes hereof, with the temptations and advantages of Satan that seem
   to be peculiar to this season; but only thus take notice of the thing
   itself, as that which presseth for and rendereth the consideration of
   the doctrine proposed not only seasonable but necessary.

   That this is a stumbling-block in the way of them that seek to walk
   with God, I suppose none of them will deny. It was so of old, and it
   will so continue until the end. And therefore our Saviour, predicting
   and discoursing of the like season, Matt. xxiv., foretelling that "many
   should be deceived," verse 11, that "iniquity should abound," and "the
   love of many wax cold," verse 12, -- that is, visibly and scandalously,
   to the contempt and seeming disadvantage of the gospel, -- adds, as a
   preservative consolation to his own chosen, select ones, who might be
   shaken in their comfort and confidence to see so many that walked to
   the house of God and took sweet counsel together with them, to fall
   headlong to destruction, that the elect shall not be seduced. Let the
   attempts of seducers be what they will, and their advantages never so
   many, or their successes never so great, they shall be preserved; the
   house upon the rock shall not be cast down; against the church built on
   Christ the gates of hell shall not prevail. And Paul mentioning the
   apostasy of Hymeneus and Philetus, who seem to have been teachers of
   some eminency, and stars of some considerable magnitude in the
   firmament of the church, with the eversion of the faith of some who
   attended unto their abominations, 2 Tim. ii. 17, 18, lest any
   disconsolation should surprise believers in reference to their own
   condition, as though that should be lubricous, uncertain, and such as
   might end in destruction and their faith in an overthrow, he
   immediately adds that effectual cordial for the reviving and
   supportment of their confidence and comfort, verse 19, "Nevertheless"
   (notwithstanding all this apostasy of eminent professors, yet) "the
   foundation of God standeth sure, The Lord knoweth them that are his;"
   -- "Those who are built upon the foundation of his unchangeable purpose
   and love shall not be prevailed against." John likewise doth the same;
   for having told his little children that there were many antichrists
   abroad in the world, and they for the most part apostates, he adds in
   his First Epistle, ii. 19, "They went out from us, but they were not of
   us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with
   us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were
   not all of us." He lets them know that by their being apostates, they
   had proved themselves to have been but hypocrites; and therefore
   believers' dwelling in safety was no way prejudiced by their
   backsliding. The like occasion now calls for the like application, and
   the same disease for the same prevention or remedy. That no sound
   persons may be shaken, because unhealthy ones are shattered, -- that
   those may not tremble who are built on the rock, because those are cast
   down who are built on the sand, -- is one part of my aim and intendment
   in handling this doctrine; and therefore I shall as little dabble in
   the waters of strife, or insist upon it in way of controversy, as the
   importunity of the adversary and that truth which we are obliged to
   contend for will permit. One Scripture, in its own plainness and
   simplicity, will be of more use for the end I aim at than twenty
   scholastical arguments, pressed with never so much accurateness and
   subtilty.

   A temptation, then, this is, and hath been of old, to the saints,
   disposed of by the manifold wisdom of God to stir them up to "take heed
   lest they fall;" to put them upon trying and examining "whether Christ,
   be in them or no;" and also to make out to those fountains of
   establishment, in his eternal purpose and gracious promises, wherein
   their refreshments and reserves under such temptations do lie. [12] And
   though our doctrine enforces us to conclude all such never to be sound
   believers, in that peculiar notion and sense of that expression which
   shall instantly be declared, who totally and finally apostatize and
   fall off from the ways of God, yet is it exceedingly remote from being
   any true ground of shaking the faith of those who truly believe, any
   farther than shaking is useful for the right and thorough performance
   of that great gospel duty of trial and self-examination.

   Mr Goodwin indeed contends, chap. ix., sect. 8-11, pp. 108-110, "That
   if we judge all such as fall away to perdition never to have been true
   believers" (that is, with such a faith as bespeaks them to enjoy union
   with Christ and acceptance with God), "it will administer a thousand
   fears and jealousies concerning the soundness of a man's own faith,
   whether that be sound or no; and so it will be indifferent as to
   consolation whether true believers may fall away or no, seeing it is
   altogether uncertain whether a man hath any of that true faith which
   cannot perish."

   Ans. But, first, God, who hath promised to make "all things work
   together for good to them that love him," in his infinite love and
   wisdom is pleased to exercise them with great variety, both within and
   without, in reference to themselves and others, for the accomplishing
   towards them all the good pleasure of his goodness, and carrying them
   on in that holy, humble, depending frame, which is needful for the
   receiving from him those gracious supplies without which it is
   impossible they should be preserved. To this end are they often exposed
   to winnowings of fierce winds, and shakings by more dreadful blasts
   than any breaths in this consideration of the apostatizing of
   professors, though of eminency. Not that God is delighted with their
   fears and jealousies, which yet he knows under such dispensations they
   must conflict withal, but with the trial and exercise of their graces
   whereunto he calls them; that is, his glory, wherein his soul is
   delighted. It is no singular thing for the saints of God to be
   exercised with a thousand fears and jealousies, and through them to
   grow to great establishment. If, indeed, they were such as were
   unconquerable, such as did not work together for their good, such as
   must needs be endless, all means of satisfaction and establishment
   being rescinded by the causes of them, then were there weight in this
   exception; but neither the Scriptures nor the experience of the saints
   of God do give the least hint to such an assertion. [13]

   Secondly, It is denied that the fall of the most glorious hypocrites is
   indeed an efficacious engine in the hands of the adversary to
   ingenerate any other fears and jealousies, or to expose them to any
   other shakings, than what are common to them in other temptations of
   daily incursion, from which God doth constantly make a way for them to
   escape, 1 Cor. x. 13. It is true, indeed, that if true believers had no
   other foundation of their persuasion that they are so but what occurs
   visibly to the observation of men in the outward conversation of them
   that yet afterward fall totally away, the apostasy of such
   (notwithstanding the general assurance they have that those who are
   born of God cannot, shall not sin unto death, 1 John iii. 9, seeing
   their own interest in that estate and condition may be clouded, at
   least for a season, and their consolation thereupon depending
   interrupted) might occasion thoughts in them of very sad consideration;
   but whilst, besides all the beams and rays that ever issued from a
   falling star, all the leaves and blossoms with abortive fruit that ever
   grew on an unrooted tree, all the goodly turrets and ornaments of the
   fairest house that ever was built on the sand, there are moreover
   "three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
   Ghost, and three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water,
   and the blood," -- whilst there is a teaching, anointing, and assuring
   earnest, a firm sealing to the day of redemption, a knowledge that we
   are passed from death to life, [14] -- the temptation arising from the
   apostasy of hypocrites is neither so potent nor unconquerable but that,
   by the grace of Him through whom we can do all things, it may be very
   well dealt withal. This I say, supposing the ordinary presence and
   operation of the Spirit of grace in the hearts of believers, with such
   shines of God's countenance upon them as they usually enjoy. Let these
   be interrupted or turned aside, and there is not the least blast or
   breath that proceeds from the mouth of the weakest enemy they have to
   deal withal but is sufficient to cast them down from the excellency of
   their joy and consolation, Ps. xxx. 6, 7.

   The evidence of this truth is such that Mr Goodwin is forced to say,
   "Far be it from me to deny but that a man may very possibly attain unto
   a very strong and potent assurance, and that upon grounds every way
   sufficiently warrantable and good, that his faith is sound and saving,"
   [15] cap. ix. sect. 9. But unto this concession he puts in a double
   exception:--

   First, "That there is not one true believer of a hundred, yea, of many
   thousands, who hath any such assurance of his faith as is built upon
   solid and pregnant foundations."

   I must, by his leave, enter my dissent hereunto; and as we have the
   liberty of our respective apprehensions, so neither the one nor the
   other proves any thing in the cause. Setting aside cases of desertion,
   great temptations, and trials, I hope, through the riches of the grace
   and tenderness of the love of the Father, the condition is otherwise
   than is apprehended by Mr Goodwin with the generality of the, family of
   God. The reasons given by him of his thoughts to the contrary do not
   sway me from my hopes, or bias my former apprehensions in the least.
   His reasons are, --

   First, "Because though the testimony of a man's heart and conscience
   touching his uprightness towards God, or the soundness of any thing
   that is saving in him, be comfortable and cheering, yet seldom are
   these properties built upon such foundations which are sufficient to
   warrant them, at least upon such whose sufficiency in that kind is duly
   apprehended: for the testimony of the conscience of a man touching any
   thing which is spiritually and excellently good is of no such value,
   unless it be first excellently enlightened with the knowledge, nature,
   properties, and condition, of that of which it testifieth; and,
   secondly, be in the actual contemplation, consideration, or
   remembrance, of what it knoweth in this kind. Now, very few believers
   in the world come up to this height and degree."

   Ans. First, There is in this reason couched a supposition which, if
   true, would be far more effectual to shake the confidence and
   resolution of believers than the most serious consideration of the
   apostasies of all professors that ever fell from the glory of their
   profession from the beginning of the world; and that is, that there is
   no other pregnant foundation of assurance but the testimony of a man's
   own heart and conscience touching his uprightness towards God, and
   therefore, before any can attain that assurance upon abiding
   foundations, they must be excellently enlightened in the nature,
   properties, and condition, of that which their consciences testify unto
   as true faith and uprightness of heart, and be clear in the disputes
   and questions about them, being in the actual contemplation of them
   when they give their testimony. I no way doubt but many thousands of
   believers, whose apprehensions of the nature, properties, and
   conditions of things, as they are in themselves, are low, weak, and
   confused, [16] yet, having received the Spirit of adoption, bearing
   witness with their, spirits that they are the children of God, and
   having the testimony in themselves, [17] have been taken up into as
   high a degree of comforting and cheering assurance, and that upon the
   most infallible foundation imaginable (for "the Spirit beareth witness,
   because the Spirit is truth," 1 John v. 6), as ever the most
   seraphically illuminated person in the world attained unto. Yea, in the
   very graces themselves of faith and uprightness of heart, there is such
   a seal and stamp, impressing the image of God upon the soul, as,
   without any reflex act or actual contemplation of those graces
   themselves, have an influence into the establishment of the souls of
   men in whom they are unto a quiet, comfortable, assured repose of
   themselves upon the love and faithfulness of God. Neither is the
   spiritual confidence of the saints shaken, much less cast to the
   ground, by their conflicting with fears, scruples, and doubtful
   apprehensions, seeing in all these conflicts they have the pledge of
   the faithfulness of God that they shall be more than conquerors. [18]
   Though they are exercised by them, they are not dejected with them, nor
   deprived of that comforting assurance and joy which they have in
   believing. But yet suppose that this be the condition practically of
   many saints of God, and that they never attain to the state of the
   primitive Christians, to whose joy and consolation in believing the
   Holy Ghost so plentifully witnesseth, 1 Pet. i. 8, nor do live up to
   that full rate of plenty which their Father hath provided for them in
   his family, and sworn that he is abundantly willing they should enjoy
   and make use of, Heb. vi. 17, 18, what will hence follow, as to the
   business in hand, I profess I know not. Must that little evidence which
   they have of their acceptance with God be therefore necessarily built
   upon such bottoms, or rather tops, as are visible to them in
   hypocrites, so that upon their apostasy they must needs not only try
   and examine themselves, but conclude, to their disadvantage and
   disconsolation, that they have no true faith? "Credat Apella."

   Secondly, The comfortableness, he tells us, of the testimony of a man's
   conscience concerning his uprightness with God "depends mainly and
   principally upon his uniform and regular walking with God. Now this
   being, by the neglects of the saints, often interrupted with many
   stains of unworthiness, the testimony itself must needs be often
   suspended. Now, true believers finding themselves outgone in ways of
   obedience by them that impenitently apostatize, if from hence they must
   conclude them hypocrites, they have no evidence left for the soundness
   of their own faith, which their consciences bear testimony unto, upon
   the fruitfulness of it, which is inferior by many degrees to that of
   them who yet finally fall away." This is the substance of one long
   section, pp. 109, 110. But, --

   First, Here is the same supposal included as formerly, that the only
   evidence of a true faith and acceptance with God is the testimony of a
   man's conscience concerning his regular and upright walking with God;
   for an obstruction in this being supposed, his comfort and consolation
   is thought to vanish. But that the Scripture builds up our assurance on
   other foundations is evident, and the saints acknowledge it, as hath
   been before delivered. Nor, --

   Secondly, Doth the testimony of a man's own conscience, as it hath an
   influence into his consolation, depend solely (nor doth Mr Goodwin
   affirm it so to do) on the constant regularity of his walking with God.
   It will also witness what former experience it hath had of God, calling
   to mind its "songs in the night," all the tokens and pledges of its
   Father's love, all the gracious visits of the holy and blessed Spirit
   of grace, all the embracements of Christ, all that intimacy and
   communion it hath formerly been admitted unto, the healing and recovery
   it hath had of wounds and from backslidings, with all the spiritual
   intercourse it ever had with God, to confirm and strengthen itself in
   the beginning of its confidence to the end. [19] And, --

   Thirdly, In the testimony that it doth give, from its walking with God,
   and the fruits of righteousness, it is very far and remote from giving
   it only, or chiefly, or indeed at all, from those ways, works, and
   fruits, which are exposed to the eyes of men, and which in others they
   who have that testimony may behold. It resolves itself herein into the
   frame, principles, and life of the hidden man of the heart, which lies
   open and naked to the eyes of God, but is lodged in depths not to be
   fathomed by any of the sons of men. [20] There is no comparison to be
   instituted between the obedience and fruits of righteousness in others,
   whereby a believer makes a judgment of them, and that in himself from
   whence the testimony mentioned doth flow; that of other men being their
   visibly practical conversation, his being the hidden, habitual frame of
   his heart and spirit in his ways and actings: so that though, through
   the falling of them, he should be occasioned to question his own faith
   as to trial and examination, yet nothing can thence arise sufficient to
   enforce him to let go even that part of his comfort which flows from
   the weakest witness and one of the lowest voices of all his store: lie
   eyes others without doors, but himself within.

   Fourthly, Whereas 1 John iii. 7, "Little children, let no man deceive
   you, he that doeth righteousness is righteous," is produced, and two
   things argued from thence, -- first, that the caveat, "Be not
   deceived," plainly intimates that true believers may very possibly be
   deceived in the estimate of a righteous man; and, secondly, that this
   is spoken of a man judging himself; and that, emphatically and
   exclusively, he and he only, is to be judged a righteous man.

   Ans. First, I say, that though I grant the first, that we may very
   easily be, and often are, deceived in our estimate of righteous
   persons, yet I do not conceive the inference to be enforced from that
   expression, "Let no man deceive you," the Holy Ghost using it
   frequently, or what is equivalent thereunto, not so much to caution men
   in a dubious thing, wherein possibly they may be mistaken, as in a way
   of detestation, scorn, and rejection of what is opposite to that which
   he is urging upon his saints, which he presseth as a thing of the
   greatest evidence and clearness; as 1 Cor. vi. 9, xv. 33; Gal. vi. 7.
   Neither is any thing more intended in this expression of the apostle
   than in that of 1 Cor. vi. 9, "Be not deceived: the unrighteous shall
   not inherit the kingdom of God." So here, no person not giving himself
   up to the pursuit of righteousness in the general drift and scope of
   his life (cases extraordinary and particular acts being always in such
   rules excepted) is, or is to be, accounted a righteous man.

   Secondly, Also it may be granted (though the intendment of the place
   leads us another way) that this is so far a rule of self-judging, that
   he whose frame and disposition suits it not, or is opposite unto it,
   cannot keep up the power or vigour of any other comfortable evidence of
   his state and condition; but that it should be so far extended as to
   make the only solid and pregnant foundation that any man hath of
   assurance and consolation to rise and flow from the testimony of his
   own conscience concerning his own regular walking in ways of
   righteousness (seeing persons that "walk in darkness and have no light"
   are called to "stay themselves on God," Isa. i. 10, and when both
   "heart and flesh faileth," yet "God is the strength of the heart," Ps.
   lxxiii. 26), is no way clear in itself, and is not by Mr Goodwin
   afforded the least contribution of assistance for its confirmation.

   To return, then, from this digression: A temptation and an offence we
   acknowledge to be given to the saints by the apostasy of professors;
   yet not such but [that] as the Lord hath in Scripture made gracious
   provision against their suffering by it or under it, so it leaves them
   not without sufficient testimony of their own acceptance with God, and
   sincerity in walking with him. This, then, was the state of old; thus
   it is in the days wherein we live.

   As the practice and ways of some, so the principles and teachings of
   others, have an eminent tendency unto offence and scandal. Indeed:,
   ever since the Reformation, there have been some endeavours against
   this truth to corrode it and corrupt it. The first serious attempt for
   the total intercision of the faith of true believers, though not a
   final excision of the faith of elect believers, was made by one in the
   other university, who, being a man of a debauched and vicious
   conversation (no small part of the growing evils of the days wherein he
   lived), did yet cry out against the doctrines of others as tending to
   looseness and profaneness, upon whose breasts and teachings was written
   "Holiness to the Lord" all their days. [21] Afterward, Arminius and his
   Quinquarticulan followers [22] taking up the matter, though they
   laboured with all their might to answer sundry of the arguments whereby
   the truth of this doctrine is demonstrated, yet for a season were very
   faint mad dubious in their own assertions, not daring to break in at
   once upon so great a treasure of the church of God; [23] and therefore
   in their Synodalia they are forced to apologize for their hesitation
   nine years before, in their conference at the Hague. But now of late,
   since the glorious light of Socinianism hath broken forth from the pit,
   men by their new succours are grown bold to defy this great truth of
   the gospel and grace of the covenant, as an abomination for ever to be
   abhorred. [24]


   "Audax omnia perpeti

   Gens humana, ruit per vetitum nefas."

   Hor., Od. i. 3, 25.

   In particular, the late studious endeavours of a learned man, in his
   treatise entitled "Redemption Redeemed," for to despoil the spouse of
   Christ of this most glorious pearl, wherewith her beloved hath adorned
   her, calls for a particular consideration: and this (discharging a
   regard unto any other motives) upon chiefly this account, that he hath
   with great pains and travail gathered together whatever hath been
   formerly given out and dispersed by the most considerable adversaries
   of this truth (especially not omitting any thing of moment in the
   synodical defence of the fifth article, with an exact translation of
   the dramatical prosopopoeias, with whatsoever looks towards his design
   in hand from their fourth attempt about the manner of conversion),
   giving it anew not only an elegant dress and varnish of rhetorical
   expressions, but moreover re-enforcing the declining cause of his
   Pelagian friends with not-to-be-despised supplies of appearing reasons
   and hidden sophistry, Col. ii. 4. So that though I shall handle this
   doctrine in my own method (with the reason whereof I shall instantly
   acquaint the reader), and not follow that author kata podas, yet
   handling not only the main of the doctrine itself, but all the
   concernments and consequences of it in the several branches of the
   method intended, I hope not to leave any thing considerable in that
   whole treatise, as to the truth in hand, undiscussed, no argument
   unvindicated, no objection unanswered, no consequence unweighed, with a
   special eye to the comparison instituted between the doctrines in
   contest, as to their direct and causal influence into the obedience and
   consolation of the saints.

   That we may know, then, what we speak and whereof we do affirm, I shall
   briefly state the doctrine under consideration, that the difference
   about it may appear. Indeed, it seems strange to me, among other
   things, that he of whom mention was lastly made, who hath liberally
   dispended so great a treasure of pains, reading, and eloquence, for the
   subverting of the truth whose explanation and defence we have
   undertaken, did not yet once attempt fairly to fix the state of the
   difference about it, but, in a very tumultuary manner, [25] fell in
   with prejudices, swelling over all bounds and limits of ordinary
   reasoning, rhetorical amplifications, upon a doctrine not attempted to
   be brought forth and explained, that it might be weighed in the
   balance, as in itself it is. Whereas there may be many reasons of such
   a proceeding, it may well be questioned whether any of them be candid
   and commendable. Certainly the advantages thence taken for the
   improving of many sophistical reasons and pretended arguments are
   obvious to every one that shall but peruse his ensuing discourse.

   Although the substance of this doctrine hath been by sundry delivered,
   yet, lest the terms wherein it is usually done may seem re, be somewhat
   too general, and some advantages of the truth, which in itself it hath,
   to have been omitted, I shall briefly state the whole matter under
   those terms wherein it is usually received.

   The title of it is, "The Perseverance of Saints." A short discover of
   whom we mean by "saints," the subject whereof we speak, and what by
   "perseverance," which is affirmed of them, will state the whole for the
   judgment of the reader. God only is essentially holy, and on that
   account the only Holy One. In his holiness, as in his being and all his
   glorious attributes, there is an actual permanency or sameness, Heb. i.
   10-12. Nothing in him is subject to the least shadow of change, -- not
   his truth, not his faithfulness, not his holiness. All principles,
   causes, and reasons of alteration stand at no less infinite distance
   from him than not-being. His properties are the same with himself, and
   are spoken of one another, as well as of his nature. His eternal power
   is mentioned by the apostle, Rom. i. 20. So is his holiness eternal,
   immutable. Of this we may have use afterward; for the present I treat
   not of it. The holiness of all creatures is accidental and created. To
   some it is innate or original; as to the angels, the first man, our
   Saviour Christ as to his human nature, of whom we treat not. Adam had
   original holiness, and lost it; so had many angels, who kept not their
   first habitation. It is hence armoured by Mr Goodwin, that spiritual
   gifts of God being bestowed may be taken away, notwithstanding the
   seeming contrary engagement of Rom. xi. 29. From what proportion or
   analogy this argument doth flow is not intimated. The grace Adam was
   endowed with was intrusted with himself and in his own keeping, in a
   covenant of works; that of the saints since the fall is purchased for
   them, laid up in their Head, and dispensed in a covenant of grace,
   whose eminent distinction from the former consists in the permanency
   and abidingness of the fruits of it. But of this afterward. To others
   it is adventitious and added, as to all that have contracted any
   qualities contrary to that original holiness wherewith at first they
   were endued; as have done all the sons of men, "who have sinned and
   come short of the glory of God." [26] Now, the holiness of these is
   either complete, as it is with the spirits of just men made perfect; or
   inchoate and begun only, as with the residue of sanctified ones in this
   life. The certain perseverance of the former in their present condition
   being not directly opposed by any, though the foundation of it be
   attempted by some, we have no need as yet to engage in the defence of
   it. These latter are said to be sanctified or holy two ways, upon the
   twofold account of the use of the word in the Scripture; for, --

   First, some persons, as well as things, are said to be holy, especially
   in the Old Testament and in the Epistle to the Hebrews, almost
   constantly using the terms of sanctifying and sanctified in a legal or
   temple signification, in reference unto their being separated from the
   residue of men with relation to God and his worship, or being
   consecrated and dedicated peculiarly to the performance of any part of
   his will, or distinct enjoyment of any portion of his mercy. [27] Thus
   the ark was said to be holy, and the altar holy; the temple was holy,
   and all the utensils of it, with the vestments of its officers. So the
   whole people of the Jews were said to be holy. The particular respects
   of covenant, worship, separation, law, mercy, and the like, upon which
   this denomination of holiness and saintship was given unto them and did
   depend, are known to all. Yea, persons inherently unclean, and
   personally notoriously wicked, in respect of their designment to some
   outward work, which by them God will bring about, are said to be
   sanctified. Distinguishing gifts, with designation to some distinct
   employment, are a bottom for this appellation, though their gifts may
   be recalled, and the employment taken from them, Isa. xiii. 3. We
   confess perseverance not to be a proper and inseparable adjunct of this
   subject, nor to belong unto such persons, as such; though they may have
   a right to it, it is upon another account. Yet, in the pursuit of this
   business, it will appear that many of our adversaries' arguments smite
   these men only, and prove that such as they may be totally rejected of
   God; which none ever denied.

   Again; the word is used in an evangelical sense, for inward purity and
   real holiness: whence some are said to be holy, and that also two ways;
   for either they are so really and in the truth of the thing itself, or
   in estimation only, and that either of themselves or others. That many
   have accounted themselves to be holy, and been pure in their own eyes,
   who yet were never washed from their iniquity, and have thereupon cried
   peace to themselves, I suppose needs no proving. It is the case of
   thousands in the world at this day. They think themselves holy, they
   profess themselves holy; and our adversaries prove (none gainsaying)
   that such as these may backslide from what they have and what they seem
   to have, and so perish under the sin of apostasy. [28] Again, some are
   said to be holy upon the score of their being so in the esteem of
   others; which was and is the condition, of many false hypocrites in the
   churches of Christ, both primitive and modern; -- like them who are
   said to "believe in Christ," upon the account of the profession they
   made so to do, yet he would not "trust himself with them, because he
   knew what was in them." Such were Judas, Simon Magus, and sundry
   others, of whom these things are spoken, which they professed of
   themselves, and were bound to answer; and which others esteemed to be
   in them. These some labour with all their strength to make true
   believers, that so they may cast the stumbling-block of their apostasy
   in the way of the saints of God closing with the truth we have in hand.
   [29] But for such as these we are no advocates; let them go to their
   "own place," according to the tenor of the arguments levied against
   them from Heb. vi. 4-6, 2 Pet. ii. 1, etc., and other places.

   Moreover, of those who are said to believe, and to be holy really and
   in the truth of the thing itself, there are two sorts: First, such as,
   having received sundry common gifts and graces of the Spirit, -- as
   illumination of the mind, change of affections, and thence amendment of
   life, with sorrow of the world, legal repentance, temporary faith, and
   the like, which are all true and real in their kind, -- do thereby
   become vessels in the great house of God, being changed as to their
   use, though not in their nature, continuing stone and wood still,
   though hewed and turned to the serviceableness of vessels; and on that
   account they are frequently termed saints and believers. On such as
   these there is a lower (and in some a subordinate) work of the Spirit,
   effectually producing in and on all the faculties of their souls
   somewhat that is true, good, and useful in itself, answering in some
   likeness and suitableness of operation unto the great work of
   regeneration, which faileth not. There is in them light, love, joy,
   faith, zeal, obedience, etc., all true in their kinds; which make many
   of them in whom they are do worthily in their generation: howbeit they
   attain not to the faith of God's elect, neither doth Christ live in
   them, nor is the life which they lead by the faith of the Son of God,
   as shall hereafter be fully declared. [30] If ye now cashier these from
   the roll of those saints and believers about whom we contend, seeing
   that they are nowhere said to be united to Christ, quickened and
   justified, partakers of the first resurrection, accepted of God, etc.,
   ye do almost put an issue to the whole controversy, and at once
   overturn the strongest forts of the opposers of this truth. Some men
   are truly ready to think that they never had experience of the nature
   of true faith or holiness, who can suppose it to consist in such like
   common gifts and graces as are ascribed to this sort of men. Yet, as
   was said before, if these may not pass for saints, if our adversaries
   cannot prove these to be true believers, in the strictest notion and
   sense of that term or expression, actum est, -- the very subject about
   which they contend is taken away; such as these alone are concerned in
   the arguments from Heb. vi. 4-6; 2 Pet. ii. 1, etc. Yea, all the
   testimonies which they produce for the supportment of their cause from
   antiquity flow from hence, that their witnesses thought good to allow
   persons baptized and professing the gospel the name of believers, and
   of being regenerate (that is, as to the participation of the outward
   symbol thereof); whom yet they expressly distinguish from them whose
   faith was the fruit of their eternal election, which they constantly
   maintained should never fail.

   Of such as these Mr Goodwin tells us, cap. ix. sect. 7, pp. 107, 108,
   "That if there be any persons under heaven who may, upon sufficient
   grounds, and justifiable by the word of God, be judged true believers,
   many of the apostates we speak of were to be judged such. All the
   visible lineaments of a true faith were in their faces, as far as the
   eye of man is able to pierce; they lived godly, righteously, and
   soberly in this present world. Doth any true believer act zealously for
   his God? -- so did they. Is any true believer fruitful in good works?
   -- they were such. Yea, there is found in those we now speak of, not
   only such things as upon the sight and knowledge whereof in men we
   ought to judge them true believers, [31] but even such things, farther,
   which we ought to reverence and honour, as lovely and majestic
   characters of God and holiness. Therefore, it is but too importune a
   pretence in men to deny them to have been true believers."

   If the proof of the first confident assertion, concerning the grounds
   of judging such as afterward have apostatized to be true believers,
   were called into question, I suppose it would prove one instance how
   much easier it is confidently to affirm any thing than soundly to
   confirm it. And perhaps it will be found to appear, that in the most,
   if not all, of those glorious apostates of whom he speaks, if they were
   thoroughly traced and strictly eyed, even in those things which are
   exposed to the view of men, for any season or continuance, such
   warpings and flaws might be discovered, in positives or negatives, as
   are incompatible with truth or grace. [32] But if this be granted, that
   they have "all the visible lineaments of a true faith in their faces,
   as far as the eye of man is able to judge, and therefore men were bound
   to esteem them for true believers," doth it therefore follow that they
   were such indeed? This at once instates all secret hypocrites in the
   ancient and present churches of Christ into a condition of
   sanctification and justification; which the Lord knows they were and
   are remote from. Shall the esteem of men translate them from death to
   life, and really alter the state wherein they are? Whatever honour,
   then, and esteem we may give to the characters of holiness and faith
   enstamped, or rather painted on theme -- as it is meet for us to judge
   well of all who, professing the Lord Christ, walk in our view in any
   measure suitable to that profession, and with Jonadab to honour Jehu in
   his fits and hasty passions of zeal, -- yet this, alas! is no evidence
   unto them, nor discovery of the thing it, self, that they are in a
   state of faith and holiness. To say that we may not be bound to judge
   any to be believers and godly, unless they are so indeed and in the
   thing itself, is either to exalt poor worms into the throne of God, and
   to make them "searchers of the hearts and triers of the reins" of
   others, who are so often in the dark as to themselves, and never in
   this life sufficiently acquainted with their own inward chambers; or
   else at once to cut off and destroy all communion of saints, by
   rendering it impossible for us to attain satisfaction who are so
   indeed, so far as to walk with them upon that account in "love without
   dissimulation," Rom. xii. 9. Doubtless the disciples of Christ were
   bound to receive them for believers of whom it is said that they did
   believe, because of their profession so to do, and that with some
   hazard and danger, though He who "knew what was in man" would not trust
   himself with them, because the root of the matter was not in them, John
   ii. 23, 24.

   I suppose I shall not need to put myself to the labour to prove or
   evince the ground of our charitable procedure, in our thoughts of men
   professing the ways of God, though their hearts are not upright with
   him. But says Mr Goodwin, "To say that whilst they stood men were
   indeed bound to judge them believers, but by their declining they
   discover themselves not to have been the men, is but to beg the
   question, and that upon very ill terms to obtain it."

   Ans. For my part, I find not in this answer to that objection ("But
   they had the lineaments of true believers, and therefore we were bound
   to judge them so"), that this did not at all prove them to be so, any
   begging of the question, but rather a fair answer given to their
   importune request, that the "appearance of the face, as far as the eyes
   of men can pierce," 1 Sam. xvi. 7, must needs conclude them in the eyes
   of God to answer that appearance in the inward and hidden man of the
   heart.

   But Mr Goodwin farther pursues his design in hand from the words of our
   Saviour, Matt. vii. 20, "By their fruits ye shall know them." "If,"
   saith he, "this rule be authentical, we do not only stand bound by the
   law of charity, but by the law of righteous or strict judgment itself,
   to judge the persons we speak of true believers, whilst they adorn the
   gospel with such fruits of righteousness as were mentioned; for our
   Saviour doth not say, By their fruits ye shall have grounds to conceive
   or conjecture them such or such, or to judge them in charity such or
   such,' but, Ye shall know them.' Now, what a man knows he is not bound
   to conjecture, or to judge in a way' of charity to be that which he
   knoweth it to be, but positively to judge and conclude of it
   accordingly. If, then, it be possible for men, by any such fruits,
   works, or expressions, to know true believers, the persons we speak of
   may be known to have been such."

   Ans. Though the words of our Saviour principally lie on the other side
   of the way, giving a rule for a condemnatory judgment of men whose evil
   fruits declare the root to be no better, -- wherein we cannot well be
   deceived, "the works of the flesh being manifest," Gal. v. 19, and he
   that worketh wickedness openly, and brings forth the effects of sin
   visibly in a course, as a tree doth its fruit, Rom. vi. 16, may safely
   be concluded, whatsoever pretence in words he makes, to be a false,
   corrupt hypocrite, -- yet, by the way of analogy and proportion, it is
   a rule also whereby our Saviour will have us make a judgment of those
   professors and teachers with whom we have to do, as to our reception
   and approbation of them. He bids his disciples taste and try the fruit
   that such persons bear, and according to that (not any specious
   pretences they make, or innocent appearances which for a season they
   show themselves in) let their estimation of them be. Yea, but says Mr
   Goodwin, "We do not only stand bound by the law of charity, but by the
   law of a righteous and strict judgment itself, to judge such persons
   believers." This distinction between the law of charity and the law of
   a righteous judgment I understand not. Though charity be the principle
   exerted eminently in such dijudications of men, yet doubtless it
   proceeds by the rules of righteous judgment. When we speak of the
   judgment of charity, we intend not a loose conjecture, much less a
   judgment contradistinct from that which is righteous, but a righteous
   and strict judgment, according to the exactest rules whatsoever that we
   have to judge by, free from evil surmises, and such like vices of the
   mind as are opposed to the grace of love. By swing it is of charity, we
   are not absolved from the most exact procedure, according to the rules
   of judging given unto us, but only bound up from indulging to any envy,
   malice, or such like works of the flesh, which are opposite to charity
   in the subject wherein it is. Charity in this assertion denotes only a
   gracious qualification in the subject, and not any condescension from
   the rule; and therefore I something wonder that Mr Goodwin should make
   a judgment of charity (as afterward) a mere conjecture, and allow
   beyond it a righteous and strict judgment, which amounts to knowledge.

   It is true, our Saviour tells us that "by their fruits we shall know
   them;" but what knowledge is it that he intendeth? Is it a certain
   knowledge by demonstration of it? or an infallible assurance by
   revelation? I am confident Mr Goodwin will not say it is either of
   these, but only such a persuasion as is the result of our thoughts
   concerning them, upon the profession they make and the works they do;
   upon which we may (according to the mind of Christ, who bare with them
   whom he knew to be no believers, having taken on them the profession of
   the faith) know how to demean ourselves towards them. So far we may
   know them by their fruits and judge of them; other knowledge our
   Saviour intendeth not, nor I believe does Mr Goodwin pretend unto. Now,
   notwithstanding all this, even on this account and by this rule, it is
   very possible, yea very easy, and practically proved true in all places
   and at all times, that we may judge, yea, so far know men to be or not
   to be seducers by their fruits, as to be able to order aright our
   demeanour towards them, according to the will of Christ, and yet be
   mistaken (though not in the performance of our duty in walking
   regularly according to the lines drawn out for our paths) in the
   persons concerning whom our judgment is; the knowledge of them being
   neither by demonstration nor from revelation, such as "cui non potest
   subesse falsum," we may be deceived.

   The saints, then, or believers (of whom alone our discourse is), may be
   briefly delineated by these few considerable concernments of their
   saintship:--

   1. That whereas "by nature they are children of wrath as well as
   others," and "dead in trespasses and sins," that faith and holiness
   which they are in due time invested withal, whereby they are made
   believers and saints, and distinguished from all others whatever, is an
   effect and fruit of, and flows from, God's eternal purpose concerning
   their salvation or election; their faith being, as to the manner of its
   bestowing, peculiarly of the operation of God, and as to its
   distinction from every other gift that upon any account whatever is so
   called, in respect of its fountain, termed "The faith of God's elect."
   [33]

   2. For the manner of their obtaining of this precious faith, it is by
   God's giving to them that Holy Spirit of his whereby he raised Jesus
   from the dead, to raise them from their death in sin, to quicken them
   unto newness of life, enduing them with a new life, with a spiritual,
   gracious, supernatural habit, spreading itself upon their whole souls,
   making them new creatures throughout (in respect of parts), investing
   them with an abiding principle, being a natural, genuine fountain of
   all those spiritual acts, works, and duties, which he is pleased to
   work in them and by them of his own good pleasure. [34]

   3. That the holy and blessed Spirit, which effectually and powerfully
   works this change in them, is bestowed upon them as a fruit of the
   purchase and intercession of Jesus Christ, to dwell in them and abide
   with them for ever: upon the account of which inhabitation of the
   Spirit of Christ in them they have union with him; that is, one and the
   same Spirit dwelling in him the head and them the members. [35]

   4. By all which, as to their actual state and condition, they are
   really changed from death to life, [36] from darkness to light, [37]
   from universal, habitual uncleanness to holiness, [38] from a state of
   enmity, stubbornness, rebellion, etc., into a state of love, obedience,
   delight, etc.; [39] and as to their relative condition, whereas they
   were children of wrath, under the curse and condemning power of the
   law, they are, upon the score of Him who was made a curse for them, and
   is made righteousness to them, accepted, justified, adopted, and
   admitted into that family of heaven and earth which is called after the
   name of God. [40]

   These alone are they of whom we treat, of whose state and condition
   perseverance is an inseparable adjunct, Wherein and in what particulars
   they are differenced from and advanced above the most glorious
   professors whatever, who are liable and obnoxious to an utter and
   everlasting separation from God, shall be afterward at large insisted
   upon; and though Mr Goodwin hath thought good to affirm that that
   description which we have, Heb. vi. 4-6, of such as ([it] is supposed)
   may be apostates, is one of the highest and most eminent that is made
   of believers in the whole Scripture, I shall not doubt but to make it
   evident that the excellency of all the expressions there used, being
   extracted and laid together, cloth yet come short of the meanest and
   lowest thing that is spoken of those concerning whom we treat; as shall
   be manifest when, through God's assistance, we arrive unto that part of
   this contest.

   That the other term, to wit, "perseverance," may be more briefly
   explicated, I shall take the shortest path. For perseverance in
   general, he came near the nature of it who said it was "In ratione bene
   consideratâ stabilis ac perpetua permansio." [41] The words and terms
   whereby it is expressed in Scripture will afterwards fall in to be
   considered. The Holy Ghost restrains not himself to any one expression
   in spiritual things of so great importance, but using that variety
   which may be suited to the instruction, supportment, and consolation of
   believers, [42] this grace (as is that of faith itself in an eminent
   manner) is by him variously expressed. To walk in the name of the Lord
   for ever; to walk with Christ as we have received him; to be confirmed
   or strengthened in the faith as we have been taught; to keep the ways
   of God's commandments to the end; to run steadfastly the race set
   before us; to rule with God; to be faithful with the saints; to be
   faithful to the death; to be sound and steadfast in the precepts of
   God; to abide or continue firm with Christ, in Christ, in the Lord, in
   the word of Christ, in the doctrine of Christ, in the faith, in the
   love and favour of God, in what we have learned and received from the
   beginning; to endure; to persist in the truth; to be rooted in Christ;
   to retain or keep faith and a good conscience; to hold fast our
   confidence and faith to the end; to follow God fully; to keep the word
   of Christ's patience; to be built upon and in Christ; to keep ourselves
   that the wicked one touch us not; not to commit sin; to be kept by the
   power of God through faith unto salvation; to stand fast as mount Zion,
   that can never be removed; to stand by faith; to stand fast in the
   faith; to stand fast in the Lord; to have the good work begun,
   perfected; to hold our profession that none take our crown; [43] --
   these, I say, and the like, are some of those expressions whereby the
   Holy Ghost holds forth that doctrine which we have in hand, which is
   usually called "The perseverance of saints," regarding principally
   their abiding with God, through Christ, in faith and obedience; which
   yet is but one part of this truth.

   The reasons and causes investing this proposition, that saints, such as
   we have described, shall so persevere, with a necessity of consequence,
   and on which the truth of it doth depend, both negatively considered
   and positively; with the limitation of perseverance, what it directly
   asserts, what not; with what failing, backsliding, and declensions, on
   the one hand and other, it is consistent, and what is destructive of
   the nature and being of it; the difference of it, as to being and
   apprehension, in respect to the subject in whom it is; with the way and
   manner whereby the causes of this perseverance have their operation on
   and effect in them that persevere, not in the least prejudicing their
   liberty, but establishing them in their voluntary obedience, -- will
   afterward be fully cleared. And hereon depends much of the life and
   vigour of the doctrine we have in hand, it being oftener in the
   Scripture held forth in its fountains, and springs, and causes, than in
   the thing itself, as will upon examination appear.

   As to what is on the other side affirmed, that believers may fall
   totally and finally away, something may be added to clear up what is
   intended thereby, and to inquire how it may come to pass. We do suppose
   (which the Scripture abundantly testifieth) that such believers have
   the Holy Spirit dwelling in them; [44] and, by his implanting, a new
   holy habit of grace. [45] The inquiry then is, how believers may come
   utterly to lose this Holy Spirit, and to be made naked of the habit of
   grace or new nature bestowed on them. That, and that only, whereunto
   this effect is ascribed is sin. Now, there are two ways whereby sin may
   be supposed to produce such effects in reference to the souls of
   believers:-- 1. Efficiently, by a reaction in the same subject, as
   frequent acts of vice will debilitate and overthrow an acquired habit
   whereunto it is opposite. 2. Meritoriously, by provoking the Lord to
   take them away in a way of punishment; for of all punishment sin is the
   morally procuring cause. Let us a little consider which of these ways
   it may probably be supposed that sin expels the Spirit and habit of
   grace from the souls of believers.

   First, [As] for the Spirit of grace which dwells in them, it cannot
   with the least colour of reason be supposed that sin should have a
   natural efficient reaction against the Spirit, which is a voluntary
   indweller in the hearts of his: he is indeed grieved and provoked by
   it, [46] but that is in a moral way, in respect of its demerit; but
   that it should have a natural efficiency by the way of opposition
   against it, as intemperance against the mediocrity which it opposeth,
   is a madness to imagine.

   The habit of grace wherewith such believers are endued is infused, not
   acquired by a frequency of acts in themselves. The root is made good,
   and then the fruit, and the work of God. It is "a new creation,"
   planted in them by "the exceeding greatness of his power," as "he
   wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead;" which he also
   "strengthens with all might" [47] and all power to the end. Is it now
   supposed, or can it rationally be so, that vicious acts, acts of sin,
   should have in the soul a natural efficiency for the expelling of an
   infused habit, and that implanted upon the soul by the exceeding
   greatness of the power of God? That it should be done by any one or two
   acts is impossible. To suppose a man, in whom there is a habit set on
   by so mighty an impression as the Scripture mentions, to act constantly
   contrary thereunto, is to think what we will, without troubling
   ourselves to consider how it may be brought about. Farther; whilst this
   principle, life, and habit of grace is thus consuming, doth their God
   and Father look on and suffer it to decay, and their spiritual man to
   pine away day by day, giving them no new supplies, nor increasing them
   with the increase of God? [48] Hath he no pity towards a dying child?
   or can he not help him? Doth he, of whom it is said that he is
   "faithful," and that he "will not suffer us to be tempted above what we
   are able, but will with the temptation make a way to escape," let loose
   such flood-gates of temptations upon them as he knows his grace will
   not be able to stand before, but will be consumed and expelled by it?
   What, also, shall we suppose are the thoughts of Jesus Christ towards a
   withering member, a dying brother, a perishing child, a wandering
   sheep? [49] Where are his zeal, and his tender mercies, and the
   sounding of his bowels? Are they restrained? Will he not lay hold of
   his strength, and stir up his righteousness, to save a poor sinking
   creature? Also, "He that is in us is greater than he that is in the
   world;" and will he suffer himself to be wrought out of his habitation,
   and not stir up his strength to keep possession of the dwelling-place
   which he had chosen? So that neither in the nature of the thing itself,
   nor in respect of him with whom we have to do, doth this seem possible.
   But, --

   Secondly, Sin procureth, by the way of merit, the taking away of the
   Spirit and removal of the habit graciously bestowed. Believers deserve
   by sin that God should take his Spirit from them, and the grace that he
   hath bestowed on them: they do so indeed; it cannot be denied. But will
   the Lord deal so with them? Will he judge his house with such fire and
   vengeance? [50] Is that the way of a father with his children? Until he
   hath taken away his Spirit and grace, although they are rebellious
   children, yet they are his children still. And is this the way of a
   tender father, to cut the throats of his children when it is in his
   power to mend them? The casting of a wicked man into hell is not a
   punishment to be compared to this; the loss of God's presence is the
   worst of hell. How infinitely must they needs be more sensible of it
   who have once enjoyed it than those who were strangers to it from the
   womb! Certainly the Lord bears another testimony concerning his
   kindness to his sons and daughters than that we should entertain such
   dismal thoughts of him. [51] He chastises his children, indeed, but he
   doth not kill them; he corrects them with rods, but his kindness he
   takes not from them. Notwithstanding of the attempt made by the
   Remonstrants, in their Synodalia, I may say that I have not as yet met
   with any tolerable extrication of these difficulties. More to this
   purpose w!ill afterward be insisted on.

   That which we intend when we mention "the perseverance of saints," is
   their continuance to the end in the condition of saint-ship whereunto
   they are called. Now, in the state of saintship, there are two things
   concurring:-- 1. That holiness which they receive from God; and, 2.
   That favour which they have with God, being justified freely by his
   grace, through the blood of Christ. And their continuance in this
   condition to the end of their lives, both as to their real holiness and
   gracious acceptance, is the perseverance whereof we must treat, -- the
   one respecting their real estate, the other their relative; of which
   more particularly afterward.

   And this is a brief delineation of the doctrine which, the Lord
   assisting, shall be explained, confirmed, and vindicated, in the
   ensuing discourse; which being first set forth as a mere skeleton, its
   symmetry and complexion, its beauty and comeliness, its strength and
   vigour, its excellency and usefulness, will, in the description of the
   several parts and branches of it, be more fully manifested.

   Now, because Mr Goodwin, though he was not pleased to fix any orderly
   state of the question under debate, -- a course he hath also thought
   good to take in handling those other heads of the doctrine of the
   gospel wherein he hath chosen to walk (for the main with the Arminians)
   in paths of difference from the reformed churches, -- yet having
   scattered up and down his treatise what his conceptions are of the
   doctrine he doth oppose, as also what he asserts in the place and room
   thereof, and upon what principles, I shall briefly call what he hath so
   delivered, both on the one hand and on the other, to an account, to
   make the clearer way for the proof of the truth which indeed we own,
   and for the discovery of that which is brought forth to contest for
   acceptance with it upon the score of truth and usefulness.

   First, then, for the doctrine of the saints' perseverance, how it
   stands stated in Mr Goodwin's thoughts, and what he would have other
   men apprehend thereof, may from sundry places in his book, especially
   chap. ix., be collected, and thus summarily presented. "It is," saith
   he, sect. 3, "a promising unto men, and that with height of assurance,
   under what looseness or vile practices soever, exemption and freedom
   from punishment." So sect. 4, "It is in vain to persuade or press men
   unto the use of such means in any kind which are in themselves
   displeasing to them, seeing they are ascertained and secured beforehand
   that they shall not fail of the end however, whether they use such
   means or no; -- a luscious and fulsome conceit (sect. 5), intoxicating
   the flesh with a persuasion that it hath goods laid up for the days of
   eternity; a notion comfortable, and betiding peace to the flesh (sect.
   15), in administering unto it certain hope that it shall, however,
   escape the wrath and vengeance which is to come, yea, though it
   disporteth itself in all manner of looseness and licentiousness in the
   meantime. A presumption it is that men (sect. 18) may or shall enjoy
   the love of God, and salvation itself, under practice of all manner of
   sin and wickedness; representing God (sect. 20) as a God in whose sight
   he is good that doth evil; promising his love, favour, and acceptance,
   as well unto dogs returning to their vomit, or to swine wallowing in
   the mire after their washing" (that is, to apostates, which that
   believers shall not be is indeed the doctrine he opposeth), "as unto
   lambs and sheep. A doctrine this whereby it is possible for me
   certainly to know, that how loosely, how profanely, how debauchedly
   soever, I should behave myself, yet God will love me, as he doth the
   holiest and most righteous man under heaven."

   With these and the like expressions doth Mr Goodwin adorn and gild over
   that doctrine which he hath chosen to oppose; with these garlands and
   flowers doth he surround the head of the sacrifice which he intends
   instantly to slay, that so it may fall an undeplored victim, if not
   seasonably rescued from the hands of this sacred officer. Neither
   through his whole treatise do I find it delivered in any other sense,
   or held out under any other notion to his reader. The course here he
   hath taken in this case, and the paths he walks in towards his
   adversaries, seems to be no other than that which was traced out by the
   bishops at Constance, when they caused devils to be painted upon the
   cap they put on the head of Huss before they cast him into the fire. I
   do something doubt (though I am not altogether ignorant how abominably
   the tenets and opinions of those who first opposed the Papacy are
   represented and given over to posterity, by them whose interest it was
   to have them thought such as they gave them out to be) whether ever any
   man that undertook to publish his conceptions to the world about any
   opinion or parcel of truth debated amongst professors of the gospel of
   Christ, did ever so dismember, disfigure, defile, wrest, and pervert,
   that which he opposed, as Mr Goodwin hath done the doctrine of
   perseverance, which he hath undertaken to destroy, rethinks a man
   should not be much delighted in casting filth and dung upon his
   adversary before he begin to grapple with him. In one word, this being
   the account he gives us of it, if he be able to name one author,
   ancient or modern, any one sober person of old or of late, that ever
   spent a penful of ink, or once opened his mouth in the defence of that
   perseverance of saints, or rather profane walking of dogs and swine,
   which he hath stated, not in the words and terms, but so much as to the
   matter or purpose here intimated by him, it shall be accepted as a just
   defensative against the crime which we are enforced to charge in this
   particular, and which otherwise will not easily be warded. If this be
   the doctrine, which, with so great an endeavour, and a contribution of
   so much pains and rhetoric, he seeks to oppose, I know not any that
   will think it worth while to interpose in this fierce contest between
   him and his man of straw. Neither can it with the least colour of truth
   be pretended that these are consequences which he urgeth the doctrine
   he opposeth withal, and not his apprehensions of the doctrine itself:
   for neither doth he in any place in his whole treatise hold it out in
   any other shape, but is uniform and constant to himself in expressing
   his notion of it; nor doth he, indeed, almost use any argument against
   it but those that suppose this to be the true state of the controversy
   which he hath proposed. But whether this indeed be the doctrine of the
   perseverance of saints which Mr Goodwin so importunately cries out
   against, upon a brief consideration of some of the particulars
   mentioned, will quickly appear.

   First, then, doth this doctrine "promise, with height of assurance,
   that under what looseness or vile practices soever men do live, they
   shall have exemption from punishment?" Wherein, I pray? -- in that it
   promiseth the saints of God, that through his grace they shall be
   preserved from such looseness and evil practices as would expose them
   to eternal punishment? [52] Doth it teach men that it is vain to use
   the means of mortification, because they shall certainly attain the end
   whether they use the means or no? Or may you not as well say that the
   doctrine you oppose is, that all men shall be saved whether they
   believe or no, with those other comfortable and cheering associate
   doctrines you mention? Or is this a regular emergency of that doctrine
   which teaches that there is no attaining the end but by the means,
   between which there is such a concatenation by divine appointment that
   they shall not be separated? Doth it "speak peace to the flesh, in
   assurance of a blessed immortality, though it disport itself in all
   folly in the meantime?" Do the teachers of it express any such thing?
   doth any such abomination issue from their arguings in the defence
   thereof? Or doth the doctrine which teaches believers (saints, who have
   tasted of the love and pardoning mercy of God, and are taught to value
   it infinitely above all the world) that such is the love and good-will
   of God towards them, in the covenant of mercy in the blood of Christ,
   that having appointed good works for them to walk in, for which of
   themselves they are insufficient, he will graciously continue to them
   such supplies of his Spirit and grace as that they shall never depart
   from following after him in ways of gospel obedience, [53] -- doth
   this, I say, encourage any of them to continue in sin that this grace
   may abound? Or are any doctrines of the gospel to be measured by the
   rules and lines of the use or abuse that the flesh is apt to make of
   them? or rather by their suitableness to the divine nature, whereof the
   saints are made partakers, and serviceableness to their carrying on to
   perfection in that attainment? Or is this an argument of validity
   against an evangelical truth, that the carnal, unbelieving heart is apt
   to turn it into wantonness? And whether believers walking after the
   Spirit, [54] -- in which frame the truths of God in the gospel are
   savoury and sweet to them, -- do experience such attendancies of the
   doctrine under consideration as are here intimated, I am persuaded Mr
   Goodwin will one day find that he hath not a little grieved the Holy
   Spirit of God by these reproaches cast upon the work of his grace.

   Farther; doth this persuasion assure men that "they shall enjoy the
   love and favour of God under the practices of all manner of sin?" or
   can this be wrested by any racks or wheels from this assertion, that
   none indeed enjoy the love and favour of God but only they towards whom
   it is effectual to turn them from the practices of all manner of sin
   and wickedness, to translate them from darkness into marvellous light,
   and from the power of Satan into the kingdom of Jesus Christ; whom the
   grace that appears unto them teacheth to deny all ungodliness and
   worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
   present world; whom that love constrains not to live unto themselves,
   but unto him that died for them? Doth it "promise the love and favour
   of God to dogs returning to their vomit, and swine wallowing in the
   mire," when the very discriminating difference of it from that doctrine
   which advanceth itself into competition with it is, that such returning
   dogs and wallowing swine did indeed, in their best estate and
   condition, never truly and properly partake of the love and favour of
   God, but notwithstanding their disgorging and washing of themselves,
   they were dogs and swine still? But to what end should I longer insist
   on these things? I am fully persuaded Mr Goodwin himself cannot make
   room in his understanding to apprehend that this is indeed the true
   notion of the doctrine which he doth oppose. Something hath been spoken
   of it already, and more, the Lord assisting, will be discussed in the
   progress of our discourse, abundantly sufficient to manifest to the
   consciences of men not possessed with prejudice against the truth that
   it is quite of another nature and consistency, of another complexion
   and usefulness, than what is here represented. I cannot but add, that
   this way of handling controversies in religion, -- namely, in proposing
   consequences and inferences of our own framing (wire-drawn with
   violence and subtilty from principles far distant from them, disowned,
   disavowed, and disclaimed by them on whom they are imposed) as the
   judgment of our adversaries, and loading them with all manner of
   reproaches, -- is such as (being of all men in the world most walked in
   by the Arminians) I desire not to be competitor with any in, "Haud
   defensoribus istis," etc.

   Let us now a little, in the next place, consider what Mr Goodwin gives
   in for that persuasion which, in opposition to the other, before by him
   displayed, he contendeth with all his strength to advance. I do not
   doubt but all that are acquainted with his way of expression ("elato
   cothurno") will, as they may reasonably, expect to have it brought
   forth meta polles phantasias, adorned with all the gallantry and
   ornaments that words can contribute thereunto; for of them there is
   with him store to be used on all occasions, Polus nomos entha kai
   entha.

   The sum of the doctrine he is so enamoured of he gives us, chap. ix.
   sect. 21, p. 115. "Longa est fabula, longæ ambages;" this is "Caput
   rei." "It is not any danger of falling away in them that are saints and
   believers, or probability of it, that he maintains, but only
   possibility of it; such as there is that sober and careful men may
   voluntarily throw themselves down from the tops of houses or steeples
   (though, perhaps, they never come there), or run into the fire or
   water, and be burned or drowned, having the use of their reason and
   understanding to preserve them from such unusual and dismal accidents:"
   [55] which seems to be an instance of as remote and infirm a
   possibility as can likely be imagined. Yea, he tells you farther, sect.
   22, "That the saints have as good security of their perseverance as he
   could have of his life to whom God should grant a lease of it for so
   long, upon condition that he did not thrust a sword through his bowels,
   or cast himself headlong down from a tower; so that his doctrine
   indulgeth to the saints as much assurance as that of perseverance,, but
   only it grants them not a liberty of sinning:" which, I presume, his
   own conscience told him that neither the other doth.

   But is this indeed Mr Goodwin's doctrine? is this all that he intends
   his arguments and proofs shall amount unto? "Ad populum phaleras."
   Strange, that when there is not so much as a probability or danger of
   falling away, yet so many and so eminent saints should so fall! How
   seldom is it that we hear of wise and sober men running into the fire,
   throwing themselves headlong from towers, thrusting swords through
   their own bowels! and nothing more frequent than the apostasy of
   saints, if these things stood upon equal terms of unlikelihood and
   improbability! The stony field in the parable seems to be every whit as
   large as the good ground, whose fruit abideth, Matt. xiii. 20, 21, 23.
   That ground, in Mr Goodwin's sense, is true believers, so that a moiety
   at least must be granted to fall away, and never come to perfection.
   Doubtless this is not easy to be received, that one half of a company
   of men in succession should constantly, from one generation to another,
   fall into ruin in such a way as wherein there is no danger of it, or
   probability that it should so come to pass. Methinks, we should scarce
   dare to walk the streets, lest at every step we be struck down by sober
   men voluntarily tumbling themselves from the tops of houses, and hardly
   keep ourselves from being wounded with the swords wherewith they run
   themselves through. Was this indeed the case with David, Solomon,
   Peter, and others, who totally apostatized from the faith? But if it be
   so, if they are thus secure, whence is it that it doth arise? what are
   the fountains, springs, and causes of this general security? Is it from
   the weakness of the opposition, and slightness of all means of
   diversion, from walking with God to the end, that they meet withal? or
   is it from the nature of that faith which they have, and grace
   wherewith they are endued? or is it that God hath graciously undertaken
   to safeguard them, and to preserve them in their abiding with him, that
   they shall not fall away? or is it that Christ intercedeth for them
   that their faith fail not, but be preserved, and their souls with it,
   by the power of God, unto the end? or from what other principle doth
   this security of theirs arise? from what fountain do the streams of
   their consolation flow? where lie the heads of this Nilus?

   That it is upon the first account, I suppose cannot enter into the
   imagination of any person who ever had the least experience of walking
   with God, or doth so much as assent to the letter of the Scripture. How
   are our enemies there described, as to their number, nature, power,
   policy, subtlety, malice, restlessness, and advantages! with what
   unimaginable and inexpressible variety of means, temptations, baits,
   allurements, enticements, terrors, threats, do they fight against us!
   Such and so many are the enemies that oppose the saints of God in their
   abiding with him, so great and effectual the means and weapons
   wherewith they fight against them, so unwearied and watchful are they
   for the improvement of all advantages and opportunities for their ruin,
   that upon the supposal of the rejection of those principles and those
   means of their preservation which we shall find Mr Goodwin to attempt,
   they will be found to be so far from a state of no danger and little
   probability of falling, or only under a remote possibility of so doing,
   that it will appear utterly impossible for them to hold out and abide
   unto the end. Had the choicest saint of God, with all the grace that he
   hath received, but one of the many enemies, and that the weakest of all
   them which oppose every saint of God, even the feeblest, to deal
   withal, separated from the strength of those principles and
   supportments which Mr Goodwin seeketh to cast down, let him lie under
   continual exhortations to watchfulness and close walking with God, he
   may as easily move mountains with his finger or climb to heaven by a
   ladder as stand before the strength of that one enemy. Adam in paradise
   had no lust within to entice him, no world under the curse to seduce
   him, yet at the first assault of Satan, who then had no part in him, he
   fell quite out of covenant with God, Ps. xxx. 6, 7.

   I shall give one instance, in one of the many enemies that fight
   against the welfare of our souls; and "ex hoc uno" we may guess at the
   residue of its companions. This is indwelling sin, whose power and
   policy, strength and prevalency, nearness and treachery, the Scripture
   exceedingly sets out, and the saints daily feel I shall only point at
   some particulars:--

   First, Concerning its nearness to us, it is indeed in us; and that not
   as a thing different from us, but it cleaveth to all the faculties of
   our souls. It is an enemy born with us, [56] bred up with us, carried
   about in our bosoms, by nature our familiar friend, our guide and
   counsellor, dear to us as our right eye, useful as our right hand, our
   wisdom, strength, etc. The apostle, Rom. vii. 17, 20, calleth it the
   "sin that dwelleth in us." It hath in us, in the faculties of our
   souls, its abode and station. It doth not pass by and away, but there
   it dwells, so as that it never goes from home, is never out of the way
   when we have any thing to do; whence, verse 21, he calls it the "evil
   that is present with him." When we go about any thing that is good, or
   have opportunity for or temptation unto any thing that is evil, it is
   never absent, but is ready to pluck us back or to put us on, according
   as it serves its ends. It is such an inmate that we can never be quit
   of its company; and so intimate unto us that it puts forth itself in
   every acting of the mind, will, or any other faculty of the soul.
   Though men would fain shake it off, yet when they would do good, this
   evil will be present with them. Then, --

   Secondly, Its universality and compass. It is not straitened in a
   corner of the soul; it is spread over the whole, all the faculties,
   affections, and passions of it. That which is born of the flesh is
   flesh; it is all flesh, and nothing but flesh. It is darkness in the
   understanding, keeping us, at best, that we know but in part, and are
   still dull and slow of heart to believe. Naturally we are all darkness,
   nothing but darkness; and though the Lord shine into our mind, to give
   us in some measure the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jesus
   Christ, yet we are still very dark, and it is a hard work to bring in a
   little light upon the soul. Especially this is seen in particular
   practical things; though in general we have very clear light and
   eviction, yet when we come to particular acts of obedience, how often
   doth our light grow dim and fail us, causing us to judge amiss of that
   which is before us, by the rising of that natural darkness which is in
   us! It is perverseness, stubbornness, obstinacy in the, will, that
   carries it with violence to disobedience and sin; it is sensuality upon
   the affections, bending them to the things of the world, alienating
   them from God; it is slipperiness in the memory, making us like leaking
   vessels, so that the things that we hear of the gospel do suddenly slip
   out, whenas other things abide firm in the cells and chambers thereof;
   it is senselessness and error in the conscience, staving it off from
   the performance of that duty which, in the name and authority of God,
   it is to accomplish: and in all these is daily enticing and seducing
   the heart to folly, conceiving and bringing forth sin. [57]

   Thirdly, Its power. The apostle calls it "a law, a law in his members,
   a law of sin," Rom. vii. 21, 23; such a law as fights, makes war, and
   leads captive, selling us under sin, not suffering us to do the good we
   would, forcing us to do the evil we would not, drawing us off from that
   we delight in, bringing us under bondage to that which we abhor. A
   powerful, unmerciful, cruel tyrant it is. O wretched men that we are!
   verse 24. There is no saint of God but in the inward man doth hate sin,
   every sin, more than hell itself, knowing the world of evils that
   attend the least sin; yet is there not one of them but this powerful
   tyrant hath compelled and forced to so many as have made them a burden
   to their own souls.

   Fourthly, Its cunning, craft, and policy. It is called in Scripture
   "the old man;" not from the weakness of its strength, but from the
   strength of its craft,. "Take heed," saith the apostle, "lest any of
   you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin," Heb. iii. 13. There is
   abundance of deceitfulness in it, being ready, fit, and prompt to
   beguile; lying in wait for advantages, furnished for all opportunities,
   and ready to close with every temptation: yea, the ways of it are so
   large and various, its wiles and methods for deceiving so innumerable,
   its fruitfulness in conceiving and bringing forth of sin so abundant,
   its advantages and opportunities so many, that it is like "the way of a
   serpent upon a rock," -- there is no tracing or finding of it out.

   A serious consideration of the opposition made unto our perseverance by
   this one enemy, which hath so much ability, and is so restless in its
   warfare, never quiet, conquering nor conquered, which can be kept out
   of none of our counsels, excluded from none of our actings, is
   abundantly sufficient to evince that it is not want or weakness of
   enemies which putteth believers out of danger of falling away.

   But all this perhaps will be granted. Enemies they have enough, and
   those much more diligent and powerful every one of them than all we
   have spoken of that now described amounteth unto; but the means of
   preservation which God affords the saints is that which puts them
   almost out of gun-shot, and gives them that golden security mentioned,
   which cometh not, in administering consolation, one step behind that
   which ariseth from the doctrine of absolute perseverance. Let, then,
   this be a little considered, and perhaps it will allay this whole
   contest. Is it, then, that such is the grace that is bestowed upon
   them, in respect of the principle whence it is bestowed (the eternal
   love of God), and the way whereby it is for them procured (the
   blood-shedding and intercession of Christ), with the nature of it
   (being the seed of God, which abideth and withereth not), and that such
   seems to be the nature of infused habits, that they are net removed but
   by the power and immediate hand of him by whom they are bestowed? Is it
   from hence that their assurance and security doth arise? "Alas! all
   this is but a fiction. There is no faith that is the fruit of election;
   Christ purchased it not for any by his death; infused habits are not;
   the grace that perisheth and that that abideth are the same. These
   things are but pretences." Is it, then, that God hath purposed from
   eternity to continue constant in his love towards them, never to leave
   them nor forsake them? "Nay, but of all things imaginable this is the
   greatest abomination, which if the Scriptures did anywhere affirm, it
   were sufficient to make a rational, considering man to question their
   authority." What then? Hath the Lord promised to give them such
   continued supplies of his Spirit and grace in Jesus Christ as that they
   shall be supported against all opposition, and preserved from all or
   any such sins as will certainly make a separation between God and their
   souls? "Nay, there is not one such promise in all the book of God; they
   are conditional;, for the enjoyment of the good things whereof
   believers stand all their days upon their good behaviour." Is it, then,
   that the Lord Jesus, who is always heard of his Father, intercedes for
   them that their faith fail not, and that they may be preserved by the
   power of God unto salvation, and that not only upon condition of their
   believing, but chiefly that they may be kept and preserved in
   believing? Or is it that their enemies are so conquered for them and on
   their behalf, in the death and resurrection of Christ, that they shall
   never have dominion over them, that their security doth arise? Neither
   the one nor the other, nor any nor all of these, are the grounds and
   foundations of their establishment., but they are wholly given up to
   the powerful hand of some considerations, which Mr Goodwin expresseth
   and setteth out to the life, chap. ix. sect. 32-34, pp. 174, 175.

   Now, because the Remonstrants [58] have always told us that God hath
   provided sufficiently for the perseverance of the saints, if they be
   not supinely wanting to themselves in the use of them, but have not
   hitherto, either jointly or severally, that I know of, taken the pains
   to discover in particular wherein that sufficiency of provision for
   their safety doth consist, or what the means are that God affords them
   to this end and purpose, Mr Goodwin, who is a learned master of all
   their counsels, having exactly and fully laid them forth as a solid
   foundation of his assertion concerning only a remote possibility of the
   saints' total defection, let it not seem tedious or impertinent if I
   transcribe, for the clearer debate of it before the reader, that whole
   discourse of his, and consider it in order as it lies.

   "If," saith he, "it be demanded what are the means which God hath given
   so abundantly to the saints, to make themselves so free, so strong in
   inclinations to avoid things so apparently destructive to the spiritual
   peace and salvation of their souls, as naturally men are to forbear all
   such occasions which are apparently destructive to their natural lives,
   so that they need not to be any whit more afraid of losing their souls
   through their own actings than men are, or need to be, of destroying
   their natural lives upon the same terms? I answer, --

   "First, He hath given them eyes wherewith, and light whereby, clearly
   and evidently to see and know that it is not more rational or man-like
   for men to refrain all such acts which they know they cannot perform
   but to the present and unavoidable destruction of their natural lives,
   than it is to forbear all sinful acts whatsoever, and especially such
   which are apparently destructive to their souls.

   "Secondly, God hath not only given them the eyes and the light we speak
   of, wherewith and whereby clearly to see and understand the things
   manifested, but hath farther endued them with a faculty of
   consideration, wherewith to reflect upon, and review, and ponder, so
   oft as they please, what they see, understand, and know in this kind.
   Now, whatsoever a man is capable, first, of seeing and knowing,
   secondly, of pondering and considering, he is capable of raising or
   working an inclination in himself towards it, answerable in strength,
   vigour, and power, to any degree of goodness or desirableness which he
   is able to apprehend therein; for what is an inclination towards any
   thing but a propension and laying out of the heart and soul towards it?
   So that if there be worth and goodness sufficient in any object
   whatsoever to bear it; and, secondly, if a man be in a capacity of
   discovering and apprehending this good clearly; and, thirdly, be in a
   like capacity of considering this vision, -- certainly he is in a
   capacity and at liberty to work himself to what strength or degree of
   desire and inclination towards it he pleaseth. Now, it is certain to
   every man that there is more good in abstaining from things either
   eminently dangerous or apparently destructive to his soul, than in
   forbearing things apparently destructive to his natural being.
   Secondly, As evident it is that every man is more capable of attaining
   or coming to the certain knowledge and clear apprehending of this
   excess of good to him in the former good than in the latter. Thirdly,
   Neither is it a thing less evident than either of the former, that
   every man is as capable of ruminating or re-apprehending the said
   excess of good as much and as oft as he pleaseth, as he is simply of
   apprehending it at all. Which supposed as undeniably true, it follows
   with a high hand, and above all contradiction, that the saints may (and
   have means and opportunities fair and full for that purpose) plant
   inclinations or dispositions in themselves to refrain all manner of
   sins apparently dangerous and destructive to the safety of their souls,
   fuller of energy, vigour, life, strength, power, than the natural
   inclination in them which teacheth them to refrain all occasions which
   they know must needs be accompanied with the destruction of their
   natural beings. Therefore, if they be more, or so much, afraid of
   destroying their lives voluntarily and knowingly (as by casting
   themselves into the fire or the water, or the like) than they are of
   falling away through sin, the fault or reason thereof is not at all in
   the doctrine, which affirms or informs them that there is a possibility
   that they fall away, but in themselves and their own voluntary
   negligence. They have means and opportunities (as we have proved) in
   abundance to render themselves every whit as secure, yea, and more
   secure, touching the latter, as they are or reasonably can be
   concerning the former."

   Ans. When I first cast an eye on this discourse of Mr Goodwin, I
   confess I was surprised to as high a degree of admiration, and some
   other affections also, as by any thing I had observed in his whole
   book; as having not met (if without offence I may be allowed to speak
   my apprehensions) with any discourse whatsoever of so transcendent a
   derogation from, and direct tendency to the overthrow of, the grace of
   Christ, but only in what is remembered, by Austin, Hilary, Fulgentius,
   with some others, of the disputes of Pelagius, Coelestius, Julianus,
   with their followers, and the Socinians of late, with whom Mr Goodwin
   would not be thought to have joined in their opposition to the merit
   and grace of Christ. As I said, then, before, if this should prove in
   the issue to be the sum of the means afforded to preserve the saints
   from apostasy and falling away into ruin, I shall be so far from
   opposing a possibility of their defection that I shall certainly
   conclude their perseverance to be impossible, being fully persuaded
   that, with all the contribution of strength which the considerations
   mentioned are able of themselves to afford unto them, they are no more
   able to meet their adversaries, who come against them with twenty
   thousand subtleties and temptations, than a man with a straw and a
   feather is to combat with and overcome a royal army. The Scripture
   tells us, and we thought it had been so, that we "are kept by the power
   of God unto salvation;" and that to this end he puts forth "the
   exceeding greatness of his power in them that believe, according to the
   working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised
   him from the dead;" whereby he "strengthens them with all might,
   according to his glorious power," "making them meet to be partakers of
   the inheritance of the saints in light." [59] It seems, though there be
   a glorious sound of words in these and innumerable the like expressions
   of the engagement of the power and faithfulness of God for the
   safeguarding of his saints, yet all this is but an empty noise and
   beating of the air; that which is indeed material to this purpose
   consisting in "certain considerations which rational men may have
   concerning their present state and future condition." But let us a
   little consider the discourse itself.

   First, It is all along magnificently supposed that there is the same
   power and ability in a rational, enlightened man to deliberate and
   conclude of things in reference unto the practical condition of his
   spiritual estate as there is of his natural, and that this ability is
   constantly resident with him, to make use of upon all occasions,
   whatever our Saviour say to the contrary, -- namely, that "without him
   we can do nothing," John xv. 5.

   Secondly (to make way for that), That such an one is able to know and
   to desire the things of his peace in a spiritual and useful manner,
   notwithstanding the vanity of those many seemingly fervent prayers of
   the saints in the Scripture, that God would give them understanding in
   these things, and his manifold promises of that grace. [60]

   Thirdly, That upon such deliberation, men are put into a capacity and
   liberty, or are enabled, to work themselves to what strength or degree
   of desire and inclination towards that good considered they please; and
   according as the good is that men apprehend (as abiding with God is the
   greatest good), such will be the strength and the vigour and power of
   their inclination thereto. That they have a law in their members
   rebelling against the law of their minds, and leading them captive
   under the law of sin, needs not to be taken notice of. This
   sufficiency, it seems, is of themselves. He was a weak, unskilful man
   who supposed that of ourselves we could not think a good thought,
   seeing we are such perfect lords and masters of all good thoughts and
   actings whatsoever. [61]

   Fourthly, The whole sum of this discourse of the means afforded
   believers to enable them to persevere amounts to this, that being
   rational men, they may, first, consider that some kinds of sins will
   destroy them and separate them from God, and that by obedience they
   shall come to the greatest good imaginable; whereupon it is in their
   power so strongly to incline their hearts unto obedience that they
   shall be in no more danger of departing from God than a wise and
   rational man is of killing or wilfully destroying himself; the, first
   part whereof may be performed by them who are no saints, the latter not
   by any saint whatsoever.

   And is not this noble provision for the security and assurance of the
   saints enough to make them cast away with speed all their interest in
   the unchangeable purposes and gracious and faithful promises of God,
   intercession of Christ, sealing of the Spirit, and all those sandy and
   trivial supports of their faith which hitherto they have rejoiced in?
   And whatever experience they have, or testimony from the word they do
   receive, of the darkness and weakness of their minds, the stubbornness
   of their wills, with the strong inclinations that are in them to sin
   and falling away, -- whatever be the oppositions from above them, about
   them, within them, on the right hand and on the left, that they have to
   wrestle withal, [62] -- let them give up themselves to the hand of
   their own manlike considerations and weighing of things, which will
   secure them against all danger or probability of falling away; for if
   they be but capable, first, of seeing and knowing, secondly, of
   pondering and considering, and that rationally (it matters not whether
   these things are fruits of the Spirit of grace or no, nay, it is clear
   they must not be so), that such and such evil is to be avoided, and
   that there is so and so great a good to be obtained by continuing in
   obedience, they may raise and work inclinations in themselves,
   answerable, in strength, vigour, and power, to any degree of goodness
   which they apprehend in what they see and ponder.

   The whole of the "ample sufficient means" afforded by God to the saints
   to enable them to persevere branching itself into these two heads, --
   first, The rational considering what they have to do; secondly, Their
   vigorous inclination of their hearts to act suitably and answerably to
   their considerations, -- I shall, in a word, consider them apart.

   First, The considerations mentioned, of evil to be avoided and good to
   be attained (I mean that which may put men upon creating those strong
   inclinations: for such considerations may be without any such
   consequence, as in her that cried, "Video meliora proboque, deteriora
   sequor"), are either issues and products of men's own natural
   faculties, and deduced out of the power of them, so that as men they
   may put themselves upon them at any time; or they are fruits of the
   Spirit of his grace, who "worketh in us both to will and to do of his
   good pleasure." [63] If they be the latter, I ask, seeing all grace is
   of promise, whether hath God promised to give and continue this grace
   of self-consideration unto believers or no? If he hath, whether
   absolutely or conditionally? If absolutely, then he hath promised
   absolutely to continue some grace in them; which is all we desire. If
   conditionally, then would I know what that condition is on which God
   hath promised that believers shall so consider the things mentioned.
   And of the condition which shall be expressed, it may farther be
   inquired whether it be any grace of God, or only a mere act of the
   rational creature as such, without any immediate in-working of the will
   and deed by God? Whatsoever is answered, the question will not go to
   rest until it be granted that either it is a grace absolutely promised
   of God, which is all we desire, or a pure act of the creature
   contradistinct thereunto, which answers the first inquiry. Let it,
   then, be granted that the considerations intimated are no other but
   such as a rational man who is enlightened to an assent to the truth of
   God may so exert and exercise as he pleaseth; then is there a
   foundation laid of all the ground of perseverance that is allowed the
   saints in their own endeavours, as men without the assistance of any
   grace of God. Now, these considerations, be they what they will, must
   needs be beneath one single good thought, for as for that we have no
   sufficiency of ourselves; yea, vanity and nothing, for without Christ
   we can do nothing; yea, evil and displeasing to God, as are all the
   thoughts and imaginations of our hearts that are only such. [64] I had
   supposed that no man in the least acquainted with what it is to serve
   God under temptations, and what the work of saving souls is, but had
   been sufficiently convinced of the utter insufficiency of such rational
   considerations, flowing only from conviction, to be a solid foundation
   of abiding with God unto the end. If men's houses of profession are
   built on such sands as these, we need not wonder to see them so
   frequently falling to the ground.

   Secondly, Suppose these considerations to act their part upon the stage
   raised for them, to the greatest applause that can be expected or
   desired, yet that which comes next upon the theatre will, I fear,
   foully miscarry, and spoil the whole plot of the play, -- that is,
   "men's vigorous inclination of their hearts to the good things pondered
   on to what height they please;" for besides that, --

   First, It is liable to the same examination that passed upon its
   associates before, or an inquiry from whence he comes, whether from
   heaven or men; upon which I doubt not but he may easily be discovered
   to be "a vagabond upon the earth," to have no pass from heaven, and so
   be rendered liable to the law of God.

   Secondly, It would be inquired whether it hath a consistency with the
   whole design of the apostle, Rom. vii. And therefore, --

   Thirdly, It is utterly denied that men, the best of men, have in
   themselves and of themselves, arising upon the account of any
   considerations whatsoever, a power, ability, or strength, vigorously or
   at all acceptably to God, to incline their hearts to the performance of
   any thing that is spiritually good, or in a gospel tendency to walking
   with God. All the promises of God, all the prayers of the saints, all
   their experience, the whole design of God in laying up all our stores
   of strength and grace in Christ, jointly cry out against it for a
   counterfeit pretence. In a word, that men are able to plant in
   themselves inclinations and dispositions to refrain all manner of sin
   destructive to the safety of their souls, fuller of energy, vigour,
   life, strength, power, than those that are in them to avoid things
   apparently tending to the destruction of their natural lives, is an
   assertion as full of energy, strength, and vigour, life, and poison,
   for the destruction and eversion of the grace of God in Christ, as any
   which can be invented.

   To shut up this discourse and to proceed: If these are the solid
   foundations of peace and consolation which the saints have concerning
   their perseverance; if these be the means "sufficient," "abundantly
   sufficient," afforded them for their preservation, that are laid in the
   balance, as to the giving of an evangelical, genuine assurance, with
   the decrees and purposes, the covenant, promises, and oath of God, the
   blood and intercession of Christ, the anointing and sealing of the
   Spirit of grace, -- I suppose we need not care how soon we enter the
   lists with any as to the comparing of the doctrines under contest, in
   reference to their influence into the obedience and consolation of the
   saints; which with its issue, in the close of this discourse, shall,
   God willing, be put to the trial.

   Now, that I may lay a more clear foundation for what doth ensue, I
   shall briefly deduce not only the doctrine itself, but also the method
   wherein I shall handle it, from a portion of Scripture, in which the
   whole is summarily comprised, and branched forth into suitable heads,
   for the confirmation and vindication thereof. And this also is required
   to the main of my design, it being not so directly to convince stout
   gainsayers, in vanquishing their objections, as to strengthen weak
   believers, in helping them against temptations; and therefore I shall
   at the entrance hold out that whereinto their faith must be ultimately
   resolved, -- the authority of God in his word being that ark alone
   whereon it can rest the sole of its foot. Now, this is the fourth
   chapter of Isaiah, of which take this short account: It is a chapter
   made up of gracious promises, given to the church in a calamitous
   season; the season itself is described, verses 25 and 26 of the third
   chapter, and the first of this, -- all holding out a distressed estate,
   a low condition. It is, indeed, God's method, to make out gracious
   promises to his people when their condition seems most deplorable, --
   to sweeten their souls with a sense of his love in the multitude of the
   perplexing thoughts which in distracted times are ready to tumultuate
   in them.

   The foundation of all the following promises lies in the second verse,
   even the giving out of the "Branch of the Lord" and the "Fruit of the
   earth" for beauty and glory to the remnant of Israel. Who it is who is
   the "Branch of the Lord "the Scripture tells us in sundry places, Isa.
   xi. 1; Jer. xxiii. 5, xxxiii. 15; Zech. iii. 8. The Lord Jesus Christ,
   the promise of whom is the church's only supportment in every trial or
   distress it hath to undergo, he is this branch and fruit; and he is
   placed in the head here as the great fountain-mercy, from whence all
   others do flow. In those that follow, the persons to whom those
   promises are made, and the matter or substance of them, are observable.
   The persons have various appellations and descriptions in this chapter.
   They are called (first) "The escaping of Israel," verse 2; "They that
   are left in Zion," verse 3; "Jerusalem" itself, verse 4; "The
   dwelling-places and assemblies of mount Zion," verse 5. That the same
   individual persons are intended in all these several appellations is
   not questionable. It is but in reference to the several acts of God's
   dwelling with them, and outgoings of his love and good-will, both
   eternal and temporal, towards them, that they come, under this variety
   of names and descriptions. First, In respect of his eternal designation
   of them to life and salvation, they are said to be "Written among the
   living," or unto life "in Jerusalem;" their names are in the Lamb's
   book of life from the foundation of the, world, [65] and they are
   recorded in the purpose of God from all eternity. Secondly, In respect
   of their deliverance and actual redemption from the bondage of death
   and Satan, which for ever prevail upon the greatest number of the sons
   of men, shadowed out by their deliverance from the Babylonish captivity
   (pointed at in this place), they are said to be "A remnant, an
   escaping, such as are left and remain in Jerusalem." [66] From the
   perishing lump of mankind God doth by Christ snatch a remnant (whom he
   will preserve), like a brand out of the fire. Thirdly, In respect of
   their enjoyment of God's ordinances and word, and his presence with
   them therein, they are called "The daughter of Zion," and "The
   dwelling-places thereof." [67] There did God make known his mind and
   will, and walked with his people in the beauties of holiness: these are
   they to whom these promises are made, the elect, redeemed, and called
   of God; or those who, being elected and redeemed, shall in their
   several generations be called, according to his purpose who worketh all
   things according to the counsel of his own will.

   For the matter of these promises, they may be reduced to these three
   heads:-- first, Of justification, verse 2; secondly, Of sanctification,
   verses 3, 4; thirdly, Of perseverance, verses 5, 6. First, Of
   justification, Christ is made to them, or given unto them, for beauty
   and glory; which how it is done the Holy Ghost tells us: Isa. lxi. 10,
   "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God;
   for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered
   me with the robe of righteousness," saith the church. He puts upon poor
   deformed creatures the glorious robe of his own righteousness, to make
   us comely in his presence and the presence of his Father, Zech. iii. 3,
   4. Through him, his being given unto us, "made unto us of God
   righteousness," becoming "the Lord our righteousness," [68] do we find
   free acceptation, as beautiful and glorious, in the eyes of God. But
   this is not all. He doth not only adorn us without, but also wash us
   within. The apostle acquaints us that that was his design, Eph. v.
   25-27; and therefore you have, secondly, the promise of sanctification
   added, verses 3, 4. Verse 3, you have the thing itself: they "shall be
   called holy," made so, -- called so by him who "calleth things that are
   not as though they were," and by that call gives them to be that which
   he calls them. He said, "Let there be light; and there was light," Gen.
   i. 3. And then the manner how it becomes to be so, verse 4; first,
   setting out the efficient cause, "the Spirit of judgment, and the
   Spirit of burning," -- that is, of holiness and light; and, secondly,
   the way of his producing this great effect, "washing away filth and
   purging away blood." Spiritual filth and blood is the defilement of
   sin; the Scripture, to set out its abomination, comparing it to the
   things of the greatest abhorrency to our nature, even as that is to the
   nature of God. [69] And this is the second promise that in and by the
   "Branch of the Lord" is here made to them "who are written unto life in
   Jerusalem." But now, lest any should suppose that both these are for a
   season only, that they are dying privileges, perishing mercies, jewels
   that may be lost, so that though the persons to whom these promises are
   made are once made glorious and comely, being in Christ freely
   accepted, yet they may again become odious in the sight of God and be
   utterly rejected, -- that being once washed, purged, cleansed, they
   should yet return to wallow in the mire, and so become wholly defiled
   and abominable, -- in the third place he gives a promise of
   perseverance, in the last two verses, and that expressed with allusion
   to the protection afforded unto the people of the Jews in the
   wilderness by a cloud and pillar of fire; which as they were created
   and instituted signs of the presence of God, so they gave assured
   protection, preservation, and direction, to the people in all their
   ways. The sum of the whole intendment of the Holy Ghost in these two
   verses seeming to be comprised in the last words of the fifth, and they
   being a suitable bottom unto the ensuing discourse, comprising, as they
   stand, in relation to the verses foregoing, the whole of my aim, with
   the way or method wherein it may conveniently be delivered, I shall a
   little insist upon them: "Upon all the glory shall be a defence."

   The words are a gospel promise expressed in law terms, or a new
   testament mercy in old testament clothes: the subject of it is "All the
   glory;" and the thing promised is "A defence over it," or upon it. By
   "The glory," some take the people themselves to be intended, who are
   the glory of God, Isa. xlvi. 13, in whom he will be glorified, and who
   are said to be made glorious, chap. iv. 2. But the pillar of fire and
   the cloud lead us another way. As the protection here promised must
   answer the protection given by them of old, so the glory here mentioned
   must answer that which was the glory of that people, when they had
   their preservation and direction from these signs of the presence of
   God in the midst of them. It is very true, the sign of God's presence
   among them itself, and the protection received thereby, is sometimes
   called his "glory," Ezek. x. 4, 18; but here it is plainly differenced
   from it, that being afterward called a "defence." That which most
   frequently was called the "glory" in the ancient dispensation of God to
   his people was the ark. When this was taken by the Philistines, the
   wife of Phinehas calls her son I-chabod, and says, "The glory is
   departed from Israel," 1 Sam. iv. 21, 22; which the Holy Ghost mentions
   again, Ps. lxxviii. 61, "And delivered his strength into captivity, and
   his glory into the enemy's hand." The tabernacle, or the tent wherein
   it was placed, is mentioned, verse 60, "He forsook the tabernacle of
   Shiloh, the tent which he placed among them;" and the people to whom it
   was given, verse 62, "He gave his people over also unto the sword;" --
   that ark being the glory and strength which went into captivity when he
   forsook the tabernacle, and gave his people to the sword. That this
   ark, the "glory" of old, was a type of Jesus Christ (besides the end
   and aim of its institution, with its use and place of its abode),
   appears from the mercy-seat or plate of gold that was laid upon it;
   which Jesus Christ is expressly said to be, Rom. iii. 25, 26, compared
   with Heb. ix. 5. It is he who is the "glory" here mentioned, not
   considered absolutely and in his own person, but as he is made "beauty
   and glory" unto his people, as he is made unto them righteousness and
   holiness, according to the tenor of the promises insisted on before.
   And this is indeed all the glory of the elect of God, [70] even the
   presence of Christ with them, as their justification and
   sanctification, their righteousness and holiness.

   The matter of the promise made in reference to this "glory" and them
   upon whom it doth abide is, that there "shall be a defence upon it."
   The word translated here "A defence" comes from a root that is but once
   read in Scripture, Deut. xxxiii. 12, where it is rendered to cover:
   "The Lord shall cover him all the day long." So it properly signifies.
   From a covering to a protection or a defence is an easy metaphor, a
   covering being given for that end and purpose. And this is the native
   signification of the word "protego," "to defend by covering;" as
   Abimelech called Abraham "the covering of Sarah's eyes," or a
   protection to her, Gen. xx. 16. The allusion also of a shade, which in
   Scripture is so often taken for a defence, [71] ariseth from hence.
   This word itself is used twice more, and in both places signifies a
   bride-chamber, Ps. xix. 5, Joel ii. 16, from the peace, covert, and
   protection of such a place. The name of the mercy-seat is also of the
   same root with this. In this place it is, by common consent, rendered
   "A defence" or protection, being so used either by allusion to that
   refreshment that the Lord Christ, the great bridegroom, gives to his
   bride in his banqueting-house, [72] or rather in pursuit of the former
   similitude of the cloud that was over the tabernacle and the ark, which
   represented the glory of that people. Thus, this "defence" or covering
   is said to be "upon" or above the "glory," as the cloud was over the
   tabernacle, and as the mercy-seat lay upon the ark. Add only this much
   to what hath been spoken (which is also affirmed in the beginning of
   the verse), namely, that this defence is "created," or is an immediate
   product of the mighty power of God, not requiring unto it the least
   concurrence of creature power, and the whole will manifest the
   intendment of the Lord everlastingly to safeguard the spiritual glories
   of his saints in Christ.

   As was before shown, there are two parts of our spiritual glory, the
   one purely extrinsical, to wit, the love and favour of God unto us, his
   free and gracious acceptation of us in Christ. On this part of our
   glory there is this defence created, that it shall abide for ever, it
   shall never be removed. His own glory and excellencies are engaged for
   the preservation of this excellency and glory of his people. This sun,
   though it may be for a while eclipsed, yet shall never set, nor give
   place to an evening that shall make long the shade thereof; whom God
   once freely accepts in Christ, he will never turn away his love from
   them, nor cast them utterly out of his favour. The other is within us,
   and that is our sanctification, our portion from God by the Spirit of
   holiness, and the fruits thereof, in our faith, love, and obedience
   unto him. And on this part of our glory there is this defence, that
   this Spirit shall never utterly be dislodged from that soul wherein he
   makes his residence, nor resign his habitation to the spirit of the
   world, -- that his fruit shall never so decay as that the fruits of
   Sodom and the grapes of Gomorrah should grow in their room, nor they
   wherein they are everlastingly, utterly, and wickedly, grow barren in
   departing from the living God. These two make up their perseverance
   whereof we speak. Whom God accepts in Christ, he will continue to do so
   for ever; whom he quickens to walk with him, they shall do it to the
   end. And these three things, acceptance with God, holiness from God,
   and a defence upon them both unto the end, all free and in Christ, are
   that threefold cord of the covenant of grace which cannot be broken.

   In the handling, then, of the doctrine proposed unto consideration, I
   shall, the Lord assisting, show, --

   First, That the love and favour of God, as to the free acceptation of
   believers with him in Christ, is constant, abiding, and shall never be
   turned away; handling at large the principles both of its being and
   manifestation.

   Secondly, That the Spirit and grace of sanctification, which they
   freely receive from him, shall never utterly be extinguished in them,
   but so remain as that they shall abide with him for ever; the
   sophistical separation of which two parts of our doctrine is the
   greatest advantage our adversaries have against the whole. And [I
   shall] demonstrate, --

   Thirdly, The real and causal influences which this truth hath into the
   obedience and consolation of the saints, considered both absolutely,
   and compared with the doctrine which is set up in competition with it.

   In the pursuit of which particulars I shall endeavour to enforce and
   press those places of Scripture wherein they are abundantly delivered,
   and vindicate them from all the exceptions put in to our inferences
   from them by Mr Goodwin in his "Redemption Redeemed;" as also answer
   all the arguments which he hath, with much labour and industry,
   collected and improved in opposition to the truth in hand. Take, then,
   only these few previous observations, and I shall insist fully upon the
   proof and demonstration of the first position, concerning the
   unchangeableness of the love of God towards his, to whom he gives Jesus
   Christ for beauty and glory, and freely accepts them in him:--

   First, As to their inherent holiness, the question is not concerning
   acts, either as to their vigour, which may be abated, or as to their
   frequency, which may be interrupted; but only as to the spirit and
   habit of it, which shall never depart. We do not say they cannot sin,
   fall into many sins, great sins, which the Scripture plainly affirms of
   all the saints that went before, (and who of them living doth not this
   day labour under the truth of it?) but through the presence of God with
   them, upon such grounds and principles as shall afterward be insisted
   on, they cannot, shall not, sin away the Spirit and habit of grace
   (which without a miracle cannot be done away by any one act, and God
   will not work miracles for the destruction of his children), so as to
   fall into that state wherein they were before they were regenerated,
   and of the children of God become children of the devil, tasting of the
   second death after they have been made partakers of the first
   resurrection, Rev. xx. 6. [73]

   Secondly, The question is not about the decay of any grace, but the
   loss of all, not about sickness and weakness, but about death itself;
   which alone we say they shall be preserved from. Neither do we say that
   believers are endowed with any such rich and plentiful stock of grace
   as that they may spend upon it without new supplies all their days; but
   grant that they stand in continual need of the renewed communication of
   that grace which hath its abode and residence in their souls, and of
   that actual assistance whereby any thing that is truly and spiritually
   good is wrought in them. [74]

   Thirdly, Whereas there is a twofold impossibility, -- first, that which
   is absolutely and simply so in its own nature, and, secondly, that
   which is so only upon some supposition, -- we say the total falling
   away of the saints is impossible only in this latter sense, the
   unchangeable decree and purpose of God, his faithful promises and oath,
   the mediation of the Lord Jesus, being in the assertion supposed. And,
   --

   Fourthly, whereas we affirm they shall assuredly continue unto the end,
   the certainty and assurance intimated is not mentis but entis, not
   subjective but objective, not always in the person persevering, but
   always relating to the thing itself. [75]

   Fifthly, That the three things formerly mentioned, acceptance with God,
   holiness from God, and the defence upon them both unto the end, are
   that threefold cord of the covenant which cannot be broken. This will
   appear by comparing these two eminent places together, which afterward
   must more fully be insisted on, Jer. xxxi. 33, 34, xxxii. 38-40. In
   general, God undertakes to be "their God," and that they shall be "his
   people," chap. xxxi. 33, xxxii. 38. And this he manifests in three
   things:-- First, That he will accept them freely, give them to find
   great favour before him, in the forgiveness of their sins; for which
   alone he hath any quarrel with them: "I will," saith he, "forgive their
   iniquity, and remember their sin no more," Jer. xxxi. 34; as it is
   again repeated Heb. viii. 12. Secondly, That they shall have
   sanctification and holiness from him: "I will put my law in their
   inward parts, and write it in their hearts," Jer. xxxi. 33; "I will put
   my fear in their hearts," chap. xxxii. 40; which Ezekiel, chap. xxxvi.
   27 calls the "putting his Spirit in them," who is the author of that
   grace and holiness which he doth bestow. Thirdly, That in both these
   there shall be a continuance for ever: Jer. xxxii. 40, "I will not turn
   away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts,
   that they shall not depart from me;" or, as verse 39, "They shall fear
   me for ever;" which distinguisheth this covenant from the former made
   with their fathers, in that that was broken, which this shall never be,
   chap. xxxi. 32. This is the crowning mercy, that renders both the
   others glorious:-- as to acceptation, he will not depart from us; as to
   sanctification, we shall not depart from him.

Chapter II. The perseverance of the saints argued from the immutability of the
divine nature.

   The thesis proposed for confirmation -- The fivefold foundation of the
   truth thereof -- Of the unchangeableness of the nature of God, and the
   influence thereof into the confirmation of the truth in hand -- Mal.
   iii. 6, considered and explained -- James i. 16-18 opened -- Rom. xi.
   29 explained and vindicated. -- The conditions on which grace is
   asserted to be bestowed and continued, discussed -- The vanity of them
   evinced in sundry instances -- Of vocation, justification, and
   sanctification -- Isa. xl. 27-31 opened and improved to the end aimed
   at; also Isa. xliv. 1-8 -- The sum of the first argument -- Mal. iii.
   6, with the whole argument from the immutability of God at large
   vindicated -- Falsely proposed by Mr G.; set right and re-enforced --
   Exceptions removed -- Sophistical comparisons exploded -- Distinct
   dispensations, according to distinction of a people -- Alteration and
   change properly and directly assigned to God by Mr G. -- The theme in
   question begged by him -- Legal approbation of duties and conditional
   acceptation of persons confounded; as also God's command and purpose --
   The unchangeableness of God's decrees granted to be intended in Mal.
   iii. 6 -- The decree directly in that place intended -- The decree of
   sending Christ not immutable, upon Mr G.'s principles -- The close of
   the vindication of this first argument.

   The certain, infallible continuance of the love and favour of God unto
   the end towards his, those whom he hath once freely accepted in Jesus
   Christ, notwithstanding the interposition of any such supposals as may
   truly be made, having foundation in the things themselves, being the
   first thing proposed, comes now to be demonstrated.

   Now, the foundation of this the Scripture lays upon five unchangeable,
   things, which eminently have an influence into the truth thereof:
   first, Of the Nature; secondly, The Purposes; thirdly, The Covenant;
   fourthly, The Promises; fifthly, The Oath of God; -- every one whereof
   being engaged herein, the Lord makes use of to manifest the
   unchangeableness of his love towards those whom he hath once graciously
   accepted in Christ.

   First, he hath laid the shoulders of the unchangeableness of his own
   nature to this work: Mal. iii. 6, "I am the Lord, I change not:
   therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed." These "sons of Jacob" are
   the sons of the faith of Jacob, the Israel of God, not all the seed of
   Jacob according to the flesh. [76] The Holy Ghost in this prophecy
   makes an eminent distinction between these two, chap. iii. 16, 17, iv.
   1, 2. The beginning of this chapter contains a most evident and clear
   prediction and prophecy of the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ in
   the gospel, wherein he was to purge his floor, and throw out the chaff
   to be burned, Matt. iii. 12. This his appearance makes great work in
   the visible church of the Jews. Very many of those who looked and
   waited for that coming of his are cut off and cast out, as persons that
   have neither lot nor portion in the mercy wherewith it is attended.
   [77] Though they said within themselves that they had Abraham to their
   father, and were the children and posterity of Jacob, yet, Mal. iii. 5,
   to them who are only the carnal seed, and do also walk in the ways of
   the flesh, he threatens a sore revenge and swift destruction, when
   others shall be invested with all the eminent mercies which the Lord
   Christ brings along with him. Lest the true sons of Jacob should be
   terrified with the dread of the approaching day, and say, as David [78]
   did when the Lord made a breach upon Uzzah, "Who can stand before so
   holy a God? shall not we also in the issue be consumed?" he discovereth
   to them the foundation of their preservation to the end, even the
   unchangeableness of his own nature and being, whereunto his love to
   them is conformed; plainly intimating that unless himself and his
   everlasting deity be subject and liable to alteration and change (which
   once to imagine were, what lieth in us, to cast him down from his
   excellency), it could not be that they should be cast off for ever and
   consumed. These are the tribes of Jacob and the preserved of Israel,
   which Jesus Christ was sent to raise up, Isa. xlix. 6; the house of
   Jacob, which he takes from the womb, and carries unto old age, unto
   hoary hairs, and forsaketh not, chap. xlvi. 3, 4.

   This is confirmed, James i. 16-18, "Do not err, my beloved brethren.
   Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down
   from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
   of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth." He
   begets us of his own will by the word of truth; for whatsoever men do
   pretend, we are born again, "not of blood, nor of the will of the
   flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God," John i. 13. "Now herein,"
   saith the apostle, "we do receive from him good and perfect gifts, --
   gifts distinguished from the common endowments of others." Yea, but
   they are failing ones perhaps, such as may flourish for a season, and
   be but children of a night, like Jonah's gourd. Though God hath
   begotten us of his own will, and bestowed good and perfect gifts upon
   us, yet he may cast us off for ever. "Do not err, my beloved brethren,"
   saith the apostle; "these things come from the Father of lights.' God
   himself is the fountain of all lights of grace which we have received;
   and with him there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning,' --
   not the least appearance of any change or alteration." And if the
   apostle did not in this place argue from the immutability of the divine
   nature to the unchangeableness of his love towards those whom he hath
   begotten and bestowed such light and grace upon, there were no just
   reason of mentioning that attribute and property there.

   Hence, Rom. xi. 29, the "gifts and calling of God" are said to be
   "without repentance." The gifts of his effectual calling (hen dia
   duoin) shall never be repented of. They are from Him with whom there is
   no change.

   The words are added by the apostle to give assurance of the certain
   accomplishment of the purpose of God towards the remnant of the Jews
   according to the election of grace. What the principal mercies were
   that were in God's intendment to them, and whereof by their effectual
   calling they shall be made partakers, he tells us, verses 26, 27: the
   Deliverer or Redeemer, which comes out of Sion, shall, according to the
   covenant of grace, turn them from ungodliness, the Lord taking away
   their sins. Sanctification and justification by Christ, the two main
   branches of the new covenant, [79] do make up the mercy purposed for
   them. The certainty of the collation of this mercy upon them,
   notwithstanding the interposition of any present obstruction (amongst
   which their enmity to the gospel was most eminent, and lay ready to be
   objected), the apostle argueth from the unchangeableness of the love of
   election, wherewith the Lord embraced them from eternity: "As touching
   the election, they are beloved." And farther to manifest on that
   account the fulfilling of what he is in the proof and demonstration of,
   -- namely, that though the major part of "Israel according to the
   flesh" were rejected, yet that the "election should obtain, and all
   Israel be saved," -- he tells them that that calling of God, whereby he
   will make out to them those eternally- designed mercies, shall not be
   repented of; eminently in that assertion distinguishing the grace
   whereof he speaks from all such common gifts and such outward
   dispensations as might be subject to a removal from them on whom they
   are bestowed. And if, upon any supposition or consideration imaginable,
   the mercies mentioned may be taken away, the assertion comes very short
   of the proof of that for which it is produced.

   Against this plain expression of the apostle, that "the gifts and
   calling of God are without repentance," Mr Goodwin puts in sundry
   exceptions, to weaken the testimony it bears in this case, chap. viii.,
   sect. 57; which because they have been already sufficiently evinced of
   weakness, falsehood, and impertinency, by his learned antagonist, [80]
   I shall only take up that which he mainly insists upon, and farther
   manifest its utter uselessness for the end for which it is produced.
   Thus, then, he pleads: "The gifts and calling of God' may be said to be
   without repentance,' because, let men continue the same persons which
   they were when the donation or collation of any gift was first made by
   God unto them, he never changes or altereth his dispensations towards
   them, unless it be for the better, or in order to their farther good;
   in which case he cannot be said to repent of what he had given. But in
   case men shall change and alter from what they were when God first
   dealt graciously with them, especially if they shall notoriously
   degenerate or cast away the principles, or divest themselves of that
   very qualification on which, as it were, God grafted his benefit or
   gift; in this case, though he recall his gift, he cannot be said to
   repent of his giving it, because the terms on which he gave it please
   him still, only the persons to whom he gave it, and who pleased him
   when he gave it them, have now tendered themselves unpleasing to him."

   Two things are here asserted:-- 1. That if men continue the same, or in
   the same state and condition wherein they were when God bestowed his
   gifts and graces upon them, then God never changeth nor altereth, --
   his dispensations towards them abide the same. 2. That there are
   certain qualifications in men upon which God grafts his grace; which
   whilst they abide, his gifts and graces abide upon them also, and
   therefore are said to be without repentance;' but if they are lost, God
   recalls his gifts, and that without any change. Let us a little
   consider both these assertions.

   And, first, It being evident that it is spiritual grace and mercy of
   which the apostle speaks, as was manifested, for they are such as flow
   from the covenant of the Redeemer, Rom. xi. 26, 27, sanctification and
   justification being particularly mentioned, let us consider what is the
   condition of men when God invests them with these mercies, that we may
   be able to instruct them how to abide in that condition, and so make
   good the possession of the grace and mercy bestowed on them. And, to
   keep close to the text, let our instance be in the three eminent
   mercies of the gospel intimated in that place: 1. Vocation; 2.
   Sanctification; 3. Justification.

   The gift and grace of vocation is confessedly here intended, being
   expressly mentioned in the words, he klesis tou Theou, that "calling"
   which is an effect of the covenant of grace, verse 29. Consider we,
   then, what is the state of men when God first calls them and gives them
   this gift and favour, that, if it seem so good, we may exhort them to a
   continuance therein.

   Now, this state, with the qualifications of it, is a state, -- 1. Of
   death: John v. 25, "The dead hear the voice of the Son of God." Christ
   speaks to them who are dead, and so they live. [81] 2. Of darkness,
   Acts xxvi. 18; "God calleth them out of darkness into his marvellous
   light," 1 Pet. ii. 9, -- a state of ignorance and alienation from God,
   Eph. iv. 18. The grace of vocation, or effectual calling, finding men
   in a state of enmity to God and alienation from him, if they may be
   prevailed withal to continue in such still, this gift shall never be
   recalled nor repented of!

   But perhaps the gift and grace of sanctification finds men in a better
   condition, in a state wherein if they abide then that also shall abide
   with them for ever. The Scripture so abounds in the description of this
   state that we shall not need to hesitate about it: Eph. ii. 1, 2, "You
   hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins." Quickening
   and renewing grace is given to persons dead in sins, and is so far from
   depending as to its unchangeableness upon their continuance in the
   state wherein it finds them, that it consists in a real change and
   translation of them from that state or condition. The apostle sets out
   this at large, Titus iii. 3-5, "We ourselves were sometimes foolish,"
   etc. The state of men when God bestows these gifts upon them is
   positively expressed in sundry particulars, verse 3; the qualifications
   on which this gift or grace is grafted (of which Mr Goodwin speaks
   afterward), negatively, verse 5. It is not on any work that we have
   done; which is unquestionably exclusive of all those stocks of
   qualifications which are intimated, whereon the gifts and graces of God
   should be grafted. The gift itself here bestowed is the "washing of
   regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost," saving us through "mercy"
   from the state and condition before described. In brief, that the
   condition wherein this grace of God finds the sons of men is a state of
   death, [82] blood, [83] darkness, blindness, [84] enmity, curse, and
   wrath, disobedience, rebellion, impotency, and universal alienation
   from God, [85] is beyond all contradiction (by testimonies plentifully
   given out, here a little and there a little, line upon line) manifest
   in the Scripture. Shall we now say that this grace of God is bestowed
   on men upon the account of these qualifications, and continued without
   revocation on condition that they abide in the same state, with the
   same qualifications? Let, then, men continue in sin, that grace may
   abound!

   Is the case any other as to justification? Doth not God justify the
   ungodly? Rom. iv. 5. Are we not in filthy robes when he comes to clothe
   us with robes of righteousness? Zech. iii. 3. Are we not reconciled to
   God when alienated by wicked works? Col. i. 21.

   These are the qualifications on which, it seems, God grafts his gifts
   and graces, and whoso abode in the persons in whom they are is the
   condition whereon the irrevocableness of those gifts and graces does
   depend. Who would have thought they had been of such reckoning and
   esteem with the Lord! And this, considering what is learnedly
   discoursed elsewhere, may suffice.

   As to the other assertion, that God gives his gifts and graces to
   qualifications, not to persons: Those qualifications are either gifts
   of God or not. If not, who made those men in whom they are differ from
   others? 1 Cor. iv. 7. If they are, on what qualifications were those
   qualifications bestowed? That God freely bestows on persons, of his own
   good pleasure, not grafting on qualifications, his gifts and graces, we
   have testimonies abundantly sufficient to outbalance Mr Goodwin's
   assertion: Rom. ix. 18, "He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy." He
   bestows his mercy and the fruits of it, not on this or that
   qualification, but on whom or what persons he will; and "to them it is
   given," saith our Saviour, "to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
   God, but to others it is not given." I see no stock that his gift is
   grafted on but only the persons of God's good-will, whom he graciously
   designs to a participation of it.

   Truth is, I know not any thing more directly contradictory to the whole
   discovery of the work of God's grace in the gospel than that which is
   couched in these assertions of Mr Goodwin; neither is it any thing less
   or more than that which of old was phrased, "The giving of grace
   according to merit," ascribing the primitive discriminating of persons
   as to spiritual grace unto self-endeavours, casting to the ground the
   free, distinguishing good pleasure of God, and that graciousness of
   every gift of his (I speak as to the first issue of his love, in
   quickening, renewing, pardoning grace) which eminently consists in
   this, that he is found of them that seek him not, and hath mercy on
   whom he will, because so it seemeth good to him.

   Not to digress farther, in the discovery of the unsatisfactoriness of
   this pretence, from the pursuit of the argument in hand: Because God's
   gifts are not repented of, therefore do men continue, not in the
   condition wherein they find them, but wherein they place them; and all
   qualifications in men whatever that are in the least acceptable to God
   are so far from being stocks whereon God grafts his gifts and graces,
   that they are plants themselves which he plants in whomsoever he
   pleaseth. Yea, the tree is made good before it bear any good fruit, and
   the branch is implanted into the true olive before it receive the sap
   or juice of any one good qualification. The sum of Mr Goodwin's answer
   amounts to this: Let men be steadfast in a good condition, and God's
   gifts shall steadfastly abide with them; if they change, they also
   shall be revoked; -- which is directly opposite to the plain intendment
   of the place, namely, that the steadfastness of men depends upon the
   irrevocableness of God's grace, and not e contra. There is not, in his
   sense, the least intimation in these words of the permanency of any
   gift or grace of God with any one on whom it is bestowed, for a day, an
   hour, or a moment; but, notwithstanding this testimony of the Holy
   Ghost, they may be given one hour, and taken away the next, -- they may
   flourish in a man in the morning, and in the evening be cut down, dried
   up, and withered. This is not to answer the arguings of men, but
   positively to deny what God affirms. To conclude: God gives not his
   gifts to men (I mean those mentioned) because they please him, but
   because it pleaseth him so to do, Jer. xxxi. 31, 32; he does not take
   them away because they displease him, but gives them so to abide with
   them that they shall never displease him to the height of such a
   provocation; neither are the gifts of God otherwise to be repented of
   than by taking them from the persons on whom they are bestowed. But
   this heap being removed, we may proceed.

   Furthermore, then, in sundry places doth the Lord propose this for the
   consolation of his, and to assure them that there shall never be an
   everlasting separation between him and them; which shall be farther
   cleared by particular instances. Things or truths proposed for
   consolation are, of all others, most clearly exalted above exception;
   without which they were no way suitable (considering the promptness of
   our unbelieving hearts to rise up against the work of God's grace and
   mercy) to compass the end for which they are proposed.

   Isa. xl. 27-31, "Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My
   way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God?
   Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the
   Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is
   weary? there is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to
   the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even
   the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly
   fall: but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they
   shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary;
   they shall walk, and not faint." Verse 27, Jacob and Israel make a
   double complaint, both parts of it manifesting some fear or dread of
   separation from God; for though in general it could not be so, yet in
   particular believers under temptation may question their own condition,
   with their right unto and interest in all the things whereby their
   state and glory is safeguarded. "My way," say they, "is hid from the
   Lord;" -- "The Lord takes no more notice, sets his heart no more upon
   my way, my walking, but lets me go and pass on as a stranger to him."
   And farther, "My judgment is passed over from my God;" -- "Mine enemies
   prevail, lusts and corruptions are strong, and God doth not appear in
   my behalf; judgment is not executed on them, and what will be the issue
   of this my sad estate?" What the Lord proposeth and holdeth out unto
   them, for their establishment, in this condition, and to assure them
   that what they feared should not come upon them, he ushers in by an
   effectual expostulation: Verse 28, "Hast thou not known?" -- "Hast thou
   not found it true by experience?" "Hast thou not heard?" -- "Hast not
   thou been taught it by the saints that went before thee?" What it is he
   would have them take notice of, and which he so pathetically insinuates
   into their understandings and affections, for their establishment, is
   an exurgency of that description of himself which he gives, verse 28:
   from his eternity, -- He is "the everlasting God;" from his power, --
   He is "the Creator of the ends of the earth;" from his
   unchangeableness, -- "He fainteth not," he waxeth not weary, and
   therefore there is no reason he should relinquish or give over any
   design that he hath undertaken, especially considering that he lays all
   his purposes in that whereby he describes himself in the last place,
   even his wisdom, -- "There is no end of his understanding." He
   establisheth, I say, their faith upon this fourfold description of
   himself, or revelation of these four attributes of his nature, as
   engaged for the effecting of that which he encourageth them to expect.
   "Who is it, O Jacob, with whom thou hast to do, that thou shouldst fear
   or complain that thou art rejected? He is eternal, almighty,
   unchangeable, infinitely wise; and if he be engaged in any way of doing
   thee good, who can turn him aside, that he should not accomplish all
   his pleasure towards thee? He will work; who shall let him?" It must be
   either want of wisdom and foresight to lay a design, or want of power
   to execute it, that exposeth any one to variableness in any
   undertaking. Therefore, that they may see how unlikely, how impossible
   a thing it is that "their way should be hid from the Lord," and "their
   judgment passed over from their God," he acquaints them who and what he
   is who hath undertaken to the contrary. But, alas! they are poor, faint
   creatures: they have no might, no strength to walk with God; unstable
   as water, they cannot excel; it is impossible they should hold out in
   the way wherein they are engaged unto the end. To obviate or remove
   such fears and misgiving thoughts, he lets them know, verse 29, that
   though they have, or may have, many decays (for they often faint, they
   often fail, whereof we have examples and complaints in the Scripture,
   made lively by our own experience), yet from him they shall have
   supplies to preserve them from that which they fear. He is eternal,
   almighty, unchangeable, and infinitely wise; he will give out power and
   increase strength when they faint and in themselves have no might at
   all. The Lord doth not propose himself under all these considerations
   to let them know what he is in himself only, but also that he will
   exert (and act suitably to) these properties in dealing with them, and
   making out supplies unto them, notwithstanding all their misgiving
   thoughts, which arise from the consideration of their own faintings and
   total want of might. Though in themselves they are weak and faint, yet
   their springs are in him, and their supplies from him, who is such as
   he hath here described himself to be. Hereupon, also, he anticipates an
   objection, by way of concession: Verse 30, "Even the youths shall faint
   and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall." Men that seem to
   have a great stock of strength and ability may yet fail and perish
   utterly; -- an objection which, as I formerly observed, these days have
   given great force unto. We see many who seem to have the vigour of
   youth and the strength of young men in the ways of God, that have
   tainted in their course and utterly failed; they began to run well, but
   lay down almost at the entrance. "And be it so," saith the Lord; "it
   shall so come to pass indeed. Many that go out in their own strength
   shall so fall and come to nothing: but what is that to thee, O Jacob,
   my chosen, thou that waitest upon the Lord? The unchangeable God will
   so make out strength to thee, that thou shalt never utterly faint, nor
   give over, but abide flying, running, walking, with speed, strength,
   and steadfastness, unto the end," verse 31. That expression, "They that
   wait upon the Lord," is a description of the persons to whom the
   premise is made, and not a condition of the promise itself. It is not,
   "If they wait upon the Lord," but "They that wait upon the Lord." If it
   were a condition of this promise, there were nothing promised; it is
   only said, "If they wait on the Lord, they shall wait on the Lord." But
   of the vanity of such conditionals I shall speak afterward.

   A scripture of the like importance you have, Isa. xliv. 1-8, "Yet now
   hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen: Thus saith
   the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help
   thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have
   chosen. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon
   the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing
   upon thine offspring: and they shall spring up as among the grass, as
   willows by the watercourses. One shall say, I am the Lord's; and
   another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall
   subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name
   of Israel. Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the
   Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there
   is no God," etc. I shall not need to insist long on the opening of
   these words: the general design of them is to give consolation and
   assurance unto Israel, from the eternity, unchangeableness, and
   absoluteness of God, with some peculiar references to the second
   person, the Redeemer, who is described, Rev. i. 8, with the titles, for
   the substance of them, whereby the Lord here holds out his own
   excellency. I shall only observe some few things from the words, for
   the illustration of the truth we have in hand, contained in them.

   The state and condition wherein Jacob, Israel, Jesurun (several titles
   upon several accounts given to believers), are described to be, is
   twofold:-- First, Of fear and disconsolation, as is intimated in the
   redoubled prohibition of that frame in them: Verse 2, "Fear not;" and
   verse 8, "Fear ye not, neither be afraid." Some temptation to farther
   distance or separation from God (the only thing to be feared) was
   fallen upon them. This they are frequently exercised withal; it is the
   greatest and most pressing temptation whereunto they are liable and
   exposed. To conclude because some believers in hypothesi may, under
   temptation, fear their own separation from God, therefore believers in
   thesi may be forsaken, yea, that unless this be true the other could
   not befall them, may pass for the arguing of men who are unacquainted
   with that variety of temptations, spiritual motions and commotions,
   which believers are exercised withal This, I say, is the first part of
   that state wherein they are supposed to be; a condition of the greatest
   difficulty in the world for the receiving of satisfaction. Secondly, Of
   barrenness, unprofitableness, and withering; which seems, and that
   justly, to be the cause of their fear: Verse 3, they are as the
   "thirsty," and as the "dry ground," parched in itself, fruitless to its
   owners, withering in their own souls, and bringing forth no fruit to
   God. A sad condition on both hands. Within they find decays, they find
   no active principles of bringing forth fruit unto God; and without
   desertion, fears at least that they are forsaken. Upon this ye have the
   foundation that the Lord lays for the refreshment of their spirits in
   this condition, and reducing of them into an established assurance of
   the continuance of his love; and that is his free, gracious election
   and choosing of them: "Thou art Jacob whom I have chosen, Jesurun whom
   I have chosen," verses 1, 2, even from eternity; when he "appointed the
   ancient people, and the things that are coming and shall come," verse
   7; when he purposed mercy for the fathers of old, whom long since he
   had brought upon that account unto himself.

   This is the "foundation" of doing them good, which "standeth sure;" as
   the apostle makes use of it to the same purpose, 2 Tim. ii. 19. This
   foundation being laid, Isa. xliv. 3, he gives them a twofold promise,
   suited to the double state wherein they were:-- First, For the removal
   of their drought and barrenness, he will give them "waters" and
   "floods" for the taking of it away; which in the following words he
   interpreteth of the "Spirit," as likewise doth the apostle John, John
   vii. 38, 39. He is the great soul-refresher; in him are all our
   springs. Saith the Lord, then, "Fear not, ye poor thirsty souls; ye
   shall have him as a flood, in great abundance, until all his fruits be
   brought forth in you." Secondly, For the removal of the other evil, or
   fears of desertion and casting off, he minds them of his covenant, or
   the blessing of their offspring, of them and their seed, according to
   his promise when he undertook to be their God, Gen. xvii. 7. And then,
   Thirdly, There is a twofold issue of God's thus dealing with them:--
   First, Of real fruitfulness: Isa. xliv. 4, "They shall be as grass"
   under perpetual showers, which cannot possibly wither and decay, or dry
   away, "and as trees planted by the rivers of water, that bring forth
   their fruit in their season, whose leaf doth not wither," Ps. i. 3.
   Secondly, Of zealous profession and owning of God, with the engagement
   of their hearts and hands unto him, which you have in Isa. xliv. 5.
   Every one for himself shall give up himself to the Lord, in the most
   solemn engagement and professed subjection that is possible. They shall
   "say," and "subscribe," and "surname" themselves, by names and terms of
   faith and obedience, to follow the Lord in the faith of Jacob or
   Israel, in the inheritance of the promises which were made to him.

   But now what assurance is there that this happy beginning shall be
   carried on to perfection, that this kindness of God to them shall abide
   to the end, and that there shall not be a separation between him and
   his chosen Israel? In the faith hereof the Lord confirms them by that
   revelation which he makes of himself and his properties, verses 6-8.
   First, in his sovereignty, he is the "King." What shall obstruct him?
   hath not he power to dispose of all things? He is the "Lord and King;"
   he will work, and who shall let him? But hath he kindness and
   tenderness to carry him out hereunto? Therefore, secondly, he is their
   "Redeemer;" and do but consider what he doth for the glory of that
   title, and what the work of redemption stood him in, and ye will not
   fear as to this nor be afraid. And all this he, thirdly, closeth with
   his eternity and unchangeableness. He is "the first, and he is the
   last, and beside him there is no God," -- the first, that chose them
   from eternity; and the last, that will preserve them to the end; and
   still the same, -- he altereth not. I shall not add more instances in
   this kind. That the Lord often establisheth his saints in the assurance
   of the unchangeableness of his love towards them from the immutability
   of his own nature is very evident. Thence comparing himself and his
   love with a tender mother and her love, he affirms that hers may be
   altered, but his shall admit of "no variableness, neither shadow of
   turning," Isa. xlix. 14-16.

   To wind up this discourse, the sum of this first part of our first
   scriptural demonstration of the truth under debate amounts to this
   argument: That which God affirms shall be certainly and infallibly
   fulfilled upon the account of the immutability of his own nature, and
   encourageth men to expect it as certainly to be fulfilled as he is
   unchangeable; that shall infallibly, notwithstanding all oppositions
   and difficulties, be wrought and perfected. Now, that such, and so
   surely bottomed is the continuance of the love of God unto his saints,
   and so would he have them to expect, etc., hath been proved by an
   induction of many particular instances, wherein those engagements from
   the immutability of God are fully expressed.

   One of these testimonies, even that mentioned in the first place, Mal.
   iii. 6, from whence this argument doth arise, is proposed to be
   considered and answered by Mr Goodwin, chap. x. sect. 40, 41, pp.
   203-207. A brief removal of his exceptions to our inference from hence
   will leave the whole to its native vigour, and the truth therein
   contained to its own steadfastness in the hand and power of that
   demonstration. Thus, then, he proposeth that place of the prophet and
   our argument from thence, whereunto be shapes his answer: "For the
   words of Malachi, I am the Lord, I change not,' from which it is wont
   to be argued that when God once loves a person, he never ceaseth to
   love him, because this must needs argue a changeableness in him in
   respect of his affection, and consequently the saints cannot fall away
   finally from his grace,' etc. So he.

   Ans. It is an easy thing so to frame the argument of an adversary as to
   contribute more to the weakening of it in its proposing than in the
   answer afterward given thereunto; and that it is no strange thing with
   Mr Goodwin to make use of this advantage in his disputations in this
   book is discerned and complained of by all not engaged in the same
   contest with himself. That he hath dealt no otherwise with us in the
   place under consideration, the ensuing observations will clearly
   manifest:--

   First, all the strength, that Mr Goodwin will allow to this argument
   ariseth from a naked consideration of the immutability of God as it is
   an essential property of his nature, when our arguing is from his
   engagement to us by and on the account of that property. That God will
   do such and such a thing because he is omnipotent, though he shall not,
   at all manifest any purpose of his will to lay forth his omnipotency
   for the accomplishment of it, is an inference all whose strength is
   vain presumption; but when God hath engaged himself for the performance
   of any thing, thence to conclude to the certain accomplishment of it,
   from his power whereby he is able to do it, is a deduction that faith
   will readily close withal. So the apostle assures us of the
   re-implanting of the Jews upon this account. "God," saith he, "is able
   to plant them in again," having promised so to do, Rom. xi. 23. There
   are two considerations upon which the unchangeableness of God hath a
   more effectual influence into the continuance of his love to his saints
   than the mere objected thought of it will lead us to an acquaintance
   withal:--

   First, God proposeth his immutability to the faith of the saints for
   their establishment and consolation, in this very case of the stability
   of his love unto them. We dare not draw conclusions in reference to
   ourselves from any property of God, but only upon the account of the
   revelation which he hath made thereof unto us for that end and purpose;
   but this being done, we have a sure anchor, firm and steadfast, to fix
   us against all blasts of temptation or opposition whatsoever. When God
   proposes his immutability or unchangeableness to assure us of the
   continuance of his love unto us, if we might truly apprehend, yea, and
   ought so to do, that his changeableness may be preserved, and himself
   vindicated from least shadow of turning, though he should change his
   mind, thoughts, love, purposes, concerning us every day, what
   conclusion for consolation could possibly arise from such proposal of
   God's immutability unto us? yea, would it not rather appear to be a way
   suited to the delusion of poor souls, that when they shall think they
   have a solid pillar, no less than an essential property of the nature
   of God, to rest upon, they shall find themselves leaning on a cloud, or
   shadow, or on a broken reed that will run into their hands, instead of
   yielding them the least supportment? God deals not thus with his
   saints. His discoveries of himself in Christ for the establishment of
   the hearts of his are not such flints as from whence the most skilful
   and exercised faith cannot expect one drop of consolation. Whatsoever
   of his name he holds out to the sons of men, it will be a strong tower
   and place of refuge and safety to them that fly unto it.

   Secondly, The consideration of that love in its continuance, wherein
   the Lord settles and puts out of doubt the souls of his, by the
   engagement of his unchangeableness, or the calling of them to the
   consideration of that property in him from whom that love doth flow,
   adds strength also to the way of arguing we insist upon. Were the lore
   of God to his nothing but the declaration of his approbation of such
   and such things, annexed to the law and rule of obedience (it might
   stand firm like a pillar in a river, though the water be not thereby
   caused to stand still one moment, but only touch it, and so pass on),
   there were some colour of exception to be laid against it. And this is,
   indeed, the proton pseudos of Mr Goodwin in this whole controversy,
   that he acknowledgeth no other love of God to believers but what lies
   in the outward approbation of what is good, and men's doing it; upon
   which account there is no more love in God to one than another, to the
   choicest saint than to the most profligate villain in the world. Nay,
   it is not any love at all, properly so called, being no internal, vital
   act of God's will, the seat of his love, but an external declaration of
   the issue of our obedience. The declaration of God's will, that he
   approves faith and obedience, is no more love to Peter than it is to
   Judas. But let now the love of God to believers be considered as it is
   in itself, as a vital act of his will, willing, if I may so speak, good
   things to them, as the immanent purpose of his will, and also joined
   with an acceptation of them in the effects of grace, favour, and love
   in Jesus Christ, and it will be quickly evidenced how an alteration
   therein will intrench upon the immutability of God, both as to his
   essence, and attributes, and decrees.

   Having thus re-enforced our argument from this place of Scripture, by
   restoring unto it those considerations which (being its main strength)
   it was maimed and deprived of by Mr Goodwin in his proposal thereof, I
   shall briefly consider the answers that by him are suggested thereunto.

   Thus, then, he proceedeth: "By the tenor of this arguing, it will as
   well follow, that in case God should at any time withdraw his love and
   his favour from a nation or body of a people which he sometimes
   favoured or loved, he should be changed. But that no such change of
   dispensation as this towards one or the same people or nation argueth
   any change at all in God, at least any such change which he disclaimeth
   as incompetent to him, is evident from those instances without number
   recorded in Scripture of such different dispensations of his towards
   sundry nations, and more especially towards the Jews, to whom sometimes
   he gives peace, sometimes consumes them with wars, sometimes he makes
   them the head, and sometimes again the tail of the nations round about
   them."

   Ans. The love and favour of God to a nation or people, here brought
   into the lists of comparison with the peculiar love of God to his
   saints, which he secures them of upon the account of his immutability,
   is either the outward dispensation of good things to them, called his
   love because it expresseth and holds out a fountain of goodness from
   whence it flows, or it is an eternal act of God's will towards them, of
   the same nature with the love to his own formerly described. If it be
   taken in the first sense, as apparently it is intended, and so made out
   from the instance of God's dealing with the Jews in outward blessings
   and punishments, Mr Goodwin doth plainly metabainein eis allo genos, --
   fall into a thing quite of another nature, instead of that which was
   first proposed. "Amphora cum coepit institui cur urceus exit?" There is
   a wide difference between outward providential dispensations and
   eternal purposes and acts of grace and good-will, to deal in the
   instance insisted on by Mr Goodwin. There being frequent mention in the
   Scripture, as afterward shall be fully declared, of a difference and
   distinction in and of that people (for "they are not all Israel that
   are of Israel," Rom. ix. 4-8), the whole lump and body of them being
   the people of God in respect of separation from the rest of the world
   and dedication to his worship and external profession, yet a remnant
   only, a hidden remnant, being his people upon the account of eternal
   designation and actual acceptation into love and favour in Jesus
   Christ, there must needs be also a twofold dispensation of God and his
   will in reference to that people, -- the first common and general,
   towards the whole body of them, in outward ordinances and providential
   exercises of goodness or justice. In this there was great variety as to
   the latter part, comprehending only external effects or products of the
   power of God; in which regard he can pull down what he hath set up, and
   set up what he hath pulled down, without the least shadow of turning,
   these various dispensations working uniformly towards the
   accomplishment of his unchangeable purposes. And this is all that Mr
   Goodwin's exceptions reach to, even a change in the outward
   dispensation of providence; which none ever denied, being that which
   may be, nay is done, for the bringing about and accomplishment, in a
   way suitable to the advancement of his glory, of his unchangeable
   purposes. What proportion there is to be argued from between the
   general effects of various dispensations and that peculiar love and
   grace of the covenant thereof, wherein God assures his saints of their
   stability upon the account of his own unchangeableness, I know not.
   Because he may remove his candlestick from a fruitless, faithless
   people, and give them up to desolation, may he therefore take his Holy
   Spirit from them that believe? For whilst that continues, the root of
   the matter is in them. So that, secondly, there is a peculiar
   dispensation of grace exerted towards those peculiar ones whom he
   owneth and receiveth, as above mentioned, wherein there are such
   engagements of the purposes, decrees, and will of God, as that the
   stream of them cannot be forced back without as great an alteration and
   change in God as the thoughts of the heart of the meanest worm in the
   world are liable unto; and on this the Lord asserts the steadfastness
   of his love to them in the midst of the changes of outward
   dispensations towards the body of that people, wherein also their
   external concernments were wrapped up, 1 Sam. xii. 22. But this will
   afterward be more fully cleared. The substance of this exception
   amounts only to thus much: There are changes wrought in the works which
   outwardly are, of God, as to general and common administrations;
   therefore, also are his eternal purposes of spiritual grace liable to
   the like alterations. Whereas Mr Goodwin says that this will not import
   any alteration in God, at least any such alteration as is incompetent
   to him, I know not of any shadow of alteration that may be ascribed to
   him without the greatest and most substantial derogation from his glory
   that you can engage into.

   And this farther clears what is farther excepted to the end of sect.
   40, in these words: "Therefore, neither the unchangeableness nor
   changeableness of God is to be estimated or measured, either by any
   variety or uniformity of dispensation towards one and the same object;
   and, consequently, for him to express himself; as this day, towards a
   person, man or woman, as if he intended to save them, or that he really
   intended to save them, and should on the morrow, as the alteration in
   the interim may be, or however may be supposed, in these persons,
   express himself to the contrary, as that he verily intends to destroy
   them, would not argue or imply the least alteration in him."

   Ans. It is true, such dispensations of God as are morally declarative
   of what God approves, or what he rejects, -- not engagements of any
   particular intendment, design, or purpose of his will, -- or such as
   are merely outward acts of his power, may in great variety be
   subservient to the accomplishment of his purposes, and may undergo (the
   first in respect of the objects, the latter of the works themselves)
   many alterations, without prejudice to the immutability of God. The
   first in themselves are everlastingly unchangeable. God always approves
   the obedience of his creatures, according to that light and knowledge
   which he is pleased to communicate unto them, and always condemns and
   disallows their rebellions; yet the same persons may do sometimes what
   he approves and sometimes what he condemns, without the least shadow of
   change in God. Whilst they thus change, his purposes concerning them,
   and what he will do to them and for them, are unchangeable as is his
   law concerning good and evil For the latter, take an instance in the
   case of Pharaoh. God purposeth the destruction of Pharaoh, and suits
   his dispensations in great variety and with many changes for the
   bringing about and accomplishing of that his unchangeable purpose; he
   plagues him and frees him, he frees him and plagues him again. All
   these things do not in the least prove any alteration in God, being all
   various effects of his power, suited to the accomplishment of an
   unchangeable purpose. So in respect of persons whom he intends to
   bring, through Christ, infallibly to himself, how various are his
   dispensations, both temporal and spiritual! He afflicts them and
   relieves them, sends them light and darkness, strength and weakness,
   forsakes and appears to them again., without the least alteration in
   his thoughts and purposes towards them; all these things, by his
   infinite wisdom, working together for their good. But now, if by
   "dispensation" you understand and comprehend also the thoughts and
   purposes of God towards any for the bringing of them to such and such
   an end, if these be altered, and the Lord doth change them continually,
   I know no reason why a poor worm of the earth may not lay an equal
   claim (absit blasphemia) to immutability and unchangeableness with him
   who asserts it as his essential property and prerogative, whereby he
   distinguisheth himself from all creatures whatsoever.

   There is also an ambiguity in that expression, "That God expresseth
   himself this day towards a man or woman that he really intends to save
   them, and on the morrow expresseth himself to the contrary." If our
   author intend only God's moral approbation of duties and performances,
   as was said before, with the conditional approbation of persons with
   respect to them, there being therein no declaration of any intention or
   purpose of God properly so called, the instance is not in the least
   looking towards the business we have in hand. But if withal he intend
   the purposes and intentions of the will of God, as these terms, "really
   intend" and "verily intend," do import, I know not what to call or
   account alteration and change if this he not. Surely if a man like
   ourselves do really intend one thing one day, and verily intend the
   clean contrary the next day, we may make bold to think and say he is
   changeable; and what apology will be found, on such a supposal, for the
   immutability of God doth not fall within the compass of my narrow
   apprehension. Neither is that parenthetical expression, of a change
   imagined in the persons concerning whom God's intentions are, any plea
   for his changeableness upon this supposal; for he either foresaw that
   change in them or he did not. If he did not, where is his prescience?
   yea, where is his deity? If he did, to what end did he really and
   verily intend and purpose to do so and so for a man, when at the same
   instant he knew the man would so behave himself as he should never
   accomplish any such intention towards him? We should be wary how we
   ascribe such lubricous thoughts to worms of the earth like ourselves;
   "but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?" If one
   should really and verily intend or purpose to give a man bread to eat
   tomorrow, who he knows infallibly will be put to death tonight, such an
   one will not, perhaps, be counted changeable, but he will scarce escape
   being esteemed a changeling. Yet it seems it must be granted that God
   verily and really intends to do so and so for men, if they be in such
   and such a condition, which he verily and really knows they will not be
   in! But suppose all this might be granted, what is it at all to the
   argument in hand concerning the Lord's engaging his immutability to his
   saints, to secure them from perishing upon the account thereof? Either
   prove that God doth change, which he saith he doth not, or that the
   saints may perish though he change not, which he affirms they cannot,
   or you speak not to the business in hand.

   The 41st section contains a discourse too long to be transcribed,
   unless it were more to the purpose in hand than it is. I shall,
   therefore, briefly give the reader a taste of some paralogisms that run
   from one end of it to the other, and then, in particular, roll away
   every stone that seems to be of any weight for the detaining captive
   the truth in whose vindication we are engaged:--

   First, From the beginning to the ending of the whole discourse the
   thing in question is immodestly begged, and many inferences made upon a
   supposal that believers may become impenitent apostates; which, being
   the sole thing under debate, ought not in itself to be taken as
   granted, and so made a proof of itself. It is by us asserted that those
   who are once freely accepted of God in Christ shall not be so forsaken
   as to become impenitent apostates, and that upon the account of the
   immutability of God, which he hath engaged to give assurance thereof.
   To evince the falsity of this, it is much pressed that if they become
   impenitent apostates, God, without the least shadow of mutability, may
   cast them off and condemn them; which is a kind of reasoning that will
   scarce conclude to the understanding of an intelligent reader. And yet
   this sandy foundation is thought sufficient to bear up many rhetorical
   expressions concerning the changeableness of God, in respect of sundry
   of his attributes, if he should not destroy such impenitent apostates
   as it is splendidly supposed believers may be. "O famâ ingens,
   ingentior armis vir Trojane." This way of disputing will scarce succeed
   you in this great undertaking.

   The second scene of this discourse is a gross confounding of God's
   legal or moral approbation of duties, and conditional [approbation] of
   persons in reference to them (which is not love properly so called, but
   a mere declaration of God's approving the thing which he commands and
   requires), with the will of God's purpose and intention, and actual
   acceptation of the persons of believers in Jesus Christ, suited
   thereunto. Hence are all the comparisons used between God and a judge
   in his love, and the express denial that God's love is fixed on any
   materially, -- that is, on the persons of any, for that is the
   intendment of it, -- but only formally, in reference to their
   qualifications. Hence, also, is that instance again and again insisted
   on, in this and the former section, of the love of God to the fallen
   angels whilst they stood in their obedience. Their obedience, no doubt
   (if any they actually yielded), fell under the approbation of God; but
   that it was the purpose and intention of God to continue and preserve
   them in that obedience cannot be asserted without ascribing to him more
   palpable mutability than can fall upon a wise and knowing man.

   Thirdly, The discourse of this section hath a contribution of strength,
   such as it is, from a squaring of the love of God unto the sweet nature
   and loving disposition of men; which is perhaps no less gross
   anthropomorphitism than they were guilty of who assigned him a body and
   countenance like to ours.

   And upon these three stilts, whereof the first is called "Petitio
   Principii," the second "Ignoratio Elenchi," and the third "Fallacia non
   causæ pro causa," is this discourse advanced.

   I shall not need to transcribe and follow the progress of this
   argumentation; the observation of the fallacies before mentioned will
   help the meanest capacity to unravel the sophistry of the whole. The
   close only of it may seem to deserve more particular consideration. So,
   then, it proceedeth: "The unchangeableness assumed by God himself unto
   himself in the work in hand, I am the Lord, I change not,' is, I
   conceive, that which is found in him in respect of his decrees; the
   reason is, because it is assigned by him as the reason why they were
   not utterly destroyed: I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons
   of Jacob are not consumed.' In the beginning of the chapter he did
   declare unto them his purpose and decree of sending his only-begotten
   Son, whom he there calls The messenger of the covenant,' unto them. He
   predicteth, verses 3, 4, the happy fruit or consequence of that his
   sending, in reference to their nation and posterity. To the
   unchangeableness of this his decree he assigns the patience which he
   had for a long time exercised towards them under their great and
   continued provocations; whereby he implies, that if he could have been
   turned out of the way of his decree concerning the sending of his Son
   unto them in their posterity, they would have done it by the greatness
   of their sins. But insomuch as this his decree, or himself in this his
   decree, was unchangeable, and it must have been changed in case they
   had been all destroyed, for the decree was for the sending to their
   nation and posterity, hence,' saith he, it comes to pass, that though
   your sins otherwise abundantly have deserved it, yet I have spared you
   from a total ruin.' Therefore, in these two last Scripture arguments,
   there is every whit as much, or rather more, against than for the
   common doctrine of perseverance."

   Ans. That the unchangeableness of God, which is mentioned in this text,
   hath relation to the decrees of God is granted; whatever, then, God
   purposeth or decreeth is put upon a certainty of accomplishment upon
   the account of his unchangeableness. There may be some use hereafter
   made of this concession, when, I suppose, the evasions that will be
   used about the objects of those decrees and their conditionality will
   scarce waive the force of our arguing from it. For the present, though
   I willingly embrace the assertion, yet I cannot assent to the analysis
   of that place of Scripture which is introduced as the reason of it. The
   design of the Lord in that place hath been before considered. That the
   consolation here intended is only this, that whereas God purposed to
   send the Lord Christ to the nation of the Jews, which he would
   certainly fulfil and accomplish, and therefore did not, nor could,
   utterly destroy them, will scarcely be evinced to the judgment of any
   one who shall consider the business in hand with so much liberty of
   spirit as to cast an eye upon the Scripture itself. That after the
   rehearsal of the great promise of sending his Son in the flesh to that
   people, he distinguisheth them into his chosen ones and those rejected,
   his remnant and the refuse of the nation, being the main body thereof,
   threatening destruction to the latter, but engaging himself into a way
   of mercy and love towards the former, hath been declared. To assure the
   last of his continuance in these thoughts and purposes of his good-will
   towards them, he minds them of his unchangeableness in all such
   purposes, and particularly encourages them to rest upon it in respect
   of his love towards themselves. That God intended to administer
   consolation to his saints in the expression insisted on is not, cannot
   be, denied. Now, what consolation could redound to them in particular
   from hence, that the whole nation should not utterly be rooted out,
   because God purposed to send his Son to their posterity?
   Notwithstanding this, any individual person that shall flee to the
   horns of this altar for refuge, that shall lay hold on this promise for
   succour, may perish everlastingly. There is scarce any place of
   Scripture where there is a more evident distinction asserted between
   the Jews who were so outwardly only and in the flesh, and those who
   were so inwardly also and in the circumcision of the heart, than in
   this and the following chapter. Their several portions are also clearly
   proportioned out to them in sundry particulars. Even this promise of
   sending the Messiah respected not the whole nation, and doubtless was
   only subservient to the consolation of them whose blessedness consisted
   in being distinguished from others, But let the context be viewed, and
   the determination left to the Spirit of truth in the heart of him that
   reads.

   Neither doth it appear to me how the decree of God concerning the
   sending of his Son into the world can be asserted as absolutely
   immutable upon that principle formerly laid down and insisted on by our
   author: He sends him into the world to die, neither is any concernment
   of his mediation so often affirmed to fall under the will and purpose
   of God as his death. But concerning this Mr Goodwin disputes, out of
   Socinus, [86] for a possibility of a contrary event, and that the whole
   counsel of God might have been fulfilled by the goodwill and intention
   of Christ, though actually he had not died. If, then, the purpose of
   God concerning Christ, as to that great and eminent part of his
   intendment therein, might have been frustrated and was liable to
   alteration, what reason can be rendered wherefore that might not upon
   some considerations (which Mr Goodwin is able, if need were, to invent)
   have been the issue of the whole decree? And what, then, becomes of the
   collateral consolation, which from the immutability of that decree is
   here asserted? Now, this being the only witness and testimony, in the
   first part of our scriptural demonstration of the truth in hand,
   whereunto any exception is put in, and the exceptions against it being
   in such a frame and composure as manifest the whole to be a combination
   of beggars and jugglers, whose pleas are inconsistent with themselves,
   as it doth now appear, upon the examination of them apart, it is
   evident that as Mr Goodwin hath little ground or encouragement for that
   conclusion he makes of this section, so the light breaking forth from a
   constellation of this and other texts mentioned is sufficient to lead
   us into an acknowledgment and embracement of the truth contended for.

   Having cleared the truth in hand, from the immutability of the nature
   of God, which himself holds out as engaged for us to rest upon, as to
   the unchangeable continuance of his love unto us, proceed we now to
   consider the steadfastness and immutability of his purposes, which he
   frequently asserts as another ground of assurance to the saints of his
   safeguarding their glory of free acceptation to the end.

   I shall not enter upon the consideration of the nature and absoluteness
   of the purposes of God as to an express handling of them, but only a
   little unfold that property and concernment of them whereon the
   strength of the inference we aim at doth in the same measure depend.
   Many needless and curious questions have been, by the serpentine wits
   of men, moved and agitated concerning them; wherein, perhaps, our
   author hath not been outgone by many; as will be judged by those who
   have weighed his discourses concerning them, with his distinctions of
   "desires, intentions, purposes, and decrees," in God. But this is not
   the business we have in hand; for what concerneth that, that which
   ensueth may suffice. God himself being an infinite pure act, those acts
   of his will and wisdom which are eternal and immanent are not
   distinguished from his nature and being but only in respect of the
   reference and habitude which they bear unto some things to be produced
   outwardly from him. The objects of them all are such things as might
   not be. God's purposes are not concerning any thing that is in itself
   absolutely necessary. He doth not purpose that he will be wise, holy,
   infinitely good, just: all these things, that are of absolute
   necessity, come not within the compass of his purposes. Of things that
   might not be are his decrees and intentions; they are of all the
   products of his power, -- all that outwardly he hath done, doth, or
   will do, to eternity. All these things, to the falling of a hair or the
   withering of a [blade of] grass, hath he determined from of old. Now,
   this divine fore-appointment of all things the Scripture assigns
   sometimes to the knowledge and understanding, sometimes to the will of
   God: "Known unto him are all his works from the beginning of the
   world," Acts xv. 18. It is that knowledge which hath an influence into
   that most infinitely wise disposal of them which is there intimated.
   And the determination of things to be done is referred to the "counsel"
   of God Acts. iv. 28; which denotes an act of his wisdom and
   understanding, and yet withal it is the "counsel of his own will," Eph.
   i. 11. [87]

   I know that all things originally owe their futurition to a free act of
   the will of God; he doth whatever he will and pleaseth. Their relation
   thereunto translates them out of that state of possibility, and [from]
   being objects of God's absolute omnipotency and infinite simple
   intelligence or understanding, whereby he intuitively beholdeth all
   things that might be produced by the exerting of his infinite almighty
   power, into a state of futurition, making them objects of God's
   foreknowledge, or science of vision, as it is called. [88] But yet the
   Scripture expresseth (as before) that act of God whereby he determines
   the beings, issues, and orders of things, [so as] to manifest the
   concurrence of his infinite wisdom and understanding in all his
   purposes. Farther; as to the way of expressing these things to our
   manner of apprehension, there are held out intentions and purposes of
   God distinctly suited to all beings, operations, and events; yet in God
   himself they are not multiplied. As all things are present to him in
   one most simple and single act of his understanding, so with one
   individual act of his will he determines concerning all. But yet, in
   reference to the things that are disposed of, we may call them the
   purposes of God. And these are the eternal springs of God's actual
   providence; which being ("ratio ordinis ad finem") the disposing of all
   things to their ends in an appointed manner and order, in exact
   correspondence unto them, these purposes themselves must be the
   infinitely wise, eternal, immanent acts of his will, appointing and
   determining all things, beings, and operations, kinds of beings,
   manners of operation, free, necessary, contingent, as to their
   existence and event, into an immediate tendency unto the exaltation of
   his glow; or, as the apostle calls them, the "counsel of his own will,"
   according whereunto he effectually worketh all things, Eph. i. 11.

   Our consideration of these purposes of God being only in reference to
   the business which we have in hand, I shall do these two things:--
   First, Manifest that they are all of them absolute and immutable;
   wherein I shall be brief, not going out to the compass of the
   controversy thereabout, as I intimated before; my intendment lies
   another way. Secondly, Show that God hath purposed the continuance of
   his love to his saints, to bring them infallibly to himself, and that
   this purpose of God, in particular, is unchangeable; which is the
   second part of the foundation of our abiding with God in the grace of
   acceptation.

   I. By the purposes of God I mean, as I said before, the eternal acts of
   his will concerning all things that outwardly are of him; which are the
   rules, if I may so speak, of all his following operations, -- all
   external, temporary products of his power universally answering those
   internal acts of his will. The judgment of those who make these decrees
   or purposes of God (for I shall constantly use these words
   promiscuously, as being purely of the same import, as relating unto
   God) to be in themselves essential to him and his very nature, or
   understanding and will, may be safely closed withal. They are in God,
   as was said, but one; there is not a real multiplication of any thing
   but subsistence in the Deity. To us these lie under a double
   consideration:-- First, Simply as they are in God; and so it is
   impossible they should be differenced from his infinite wisdom and
   will, whereby he determineth of any thing. Secondly, In respect of the
   habitude and relation which they bear to the things determined, which
   the wisdom and will of God might not have had. In the first sense, as
   was said, they can be nothing but the very nature of God, the to velle
   of God, his internal willing of any thing that is either created or
   uncreated; for these terms distribute the whole nature of being.
   Created they are not, for they are eternal (that no new immanent act
   can possibly be ascribed to God hath full well of late been
   demonstrated). Farther; if they are created, then God willed that they
   should be created, for he created only what he willed. If so, was he
   willing they should be created, or no? If he were, then a progress will
   be given infinitely, for the question will arise up to eternity. If
   uncreated, then doubtless they are God himself, for he only is so; it
   is impossible that a creature should be uncreated. Again; God's very
   willing of things is the cause of all things, and therefore must needs
   be omnipotent and God himself. That "voluntas Dei" is "causa rerum" is
   taken for granted, and may be proved from Ps. cxv. 3, which the apostle
   ascribes omnipotency unto, Rom. ix. 19, "Who hath resisted his will?"
   Doubtless it is the property of God alone to be the cause of all
   things, and to be almighty in his so being. But hereof at present no
   more. On this supposal, the immutability of the decrees of God would
   plainly be coincident with the immutability of his nature, before
   handled.

   It is, then, of the decrees and purposes of God, with respect to the
   matters about which they are, whereof I speak: in which regard, also,
   they are absolute and immutable; -- not that they work any essential
   change in the things themselves concerning which they are, making that
   to be immutable from thence which in its own nature is mutable; but
   only that themselves, as acts of the infinite wisdom and will of God,
   are not liable to nor suspended on any condition whatever foreign to
   themselves, nor subject to change or alteration (whence floweth an
   infallible certainty of actual accomplishment in reference to the
   things decreed or purposed, be their own nature what it will, or their
   next causes in themselves never so undetermined to their production),
   whereof I treat. That the determining purposes or decrees of God's will
   concerning any thing or things by him to be done or effected do not
   depend, as to their accomplishment, on any conditions that may be
   supposed in or about the things themselves whereof they are, and
   therefore are unchangeable, and shall certainly be brought forth unto
   the appointed issue, is that which we are to prove Knowing for whose
   sakes [89] and for what end this labour was undertaken, I shall choose
   to lay the whole proof of this assertion upon plain texts of Scripture,
   rather than mix my discourse with any such philosophical reasonings as
   are of little use to the most of them whose benefit is hereby intended.

   Isa. xlvi. 9-11, The Holy Ghost speaks expressly to our purpose:
   "Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none
   else; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the
   beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done,
   saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: calling
   a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a
   far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I
   have purposed it, I will also do it." Verse 9, the Lord asserts his own
   deity and eternal being, in opposition to all false gods and idols,
   whom he threatens to destroy, verse 1. Of this he gives them a
   threefold demonstration:--

   First, From his prescience or foreknowledge: "There is none like me,
   declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things
   that are not yet done;" -- "In this am I infinitely discriminated from
   all the pretended deities of the nations. All things from the beginning
   to the end are naked before me, and I have declared them by my
   prophets, even things that are future and contingent in themselves. So
   are the things that I now speak of. The destruction of Babylon by the
   Medes and Persians is a thing to be carried on through innumerable
   contingencies; and yet as I have seen it so have I told it, and my
   counsel concerning it shall certainly be executed."

   Secondly, By his power, in using what instruments he pleaseth for the
   executing of his purposes and bringing about his own designs: "Calling
   a ravenous bird from the east;" -- one that at first, when he went
   against Babylon, thought of nothing less than executing the counsel of
   God, but was wholly bent upon satisfying his own rapine and ambition,
   not knowing then in the least by whom he was anointed and sanctified
   for the accomplishment of his will. All the thoughts of his heart, all
   his consultations and actions, all his progresses and diversions, his
   success in his great and dreadful undertaking, to break in pieces that
   "hammer of the whole earth," with all the free deliberations and
   contingencies wherewith his long war was attended, which were as many,
   strong, and various, as the nature of things is capable to receive,
   were not only in every individual act, with its minutest circumstances,
   by him foreseen, and much also foretold, but also managed in the hand
   of his power in a regular subservience to that call which he so gave
   that "ravenous bird" for the accomplishment of his purpose and
   pleasure. [90]

   Thirdly, By the immutability of his purposes, which can never be
   frustrated nor altered: "My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my
   pleasure; -- I have purposed it, and I will also do it." The standing,
   or fixedness and unchangeableness, of his counsel, he manifests by the
   accomplishment of the things which therein he had determined; neither
   is there any salve for his immutability in his counsel, should it
   otherwise fall out. And if we may take his own testimony of himself,
   what he purposeth, that he doth; and in the actual fulfilling and the
   bringing about of things themselves purposed, and as purposed, without
   any possibility of diversion from the real end intended, is their
   stability and unchangeableness in them manifested. An imaginary
   immutability in God's purposes, which may consist and be preserved
   under their utter frustration as to the fulfilling of the things
   themselves under which they are, the Scripture knows not, neither can
   reason conceive. Now, this unchangeableness of his purposes the Lord
   brings as one demonstration of his deity; and those who make them
   liable to alteration, upon any account or supposition whatsoever, do
   depress him, what in them lies, into the number of such dung-hill gods
   as he threatens to famish and destroy.

   Ps. xxxiii. 9-11, "He spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it
   stood fast. The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
   maketh the devices of the people of none effect. The counsel of the
   Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations."
   The production and establishment of all things in that order wherein
   they are, are by the psalmist ascribed to the will and power of God. By
   his word and command they not only are, but stand fast; being fixed in
   that order by him appointed. Both the making, fixing, and sustaining of
   all things, is by "the word of his power." As the first relates to
   their being, which they have from creation, so the other to the order
   in subsistence and operation, which relates to his actual providence.
   Herein they stand fast. Themselves, with their several and respective
   relations, dependencies, influences, circumstances, suited to that
   nature and being which was bestowed on them by his word in their
   creation, are settled in an exact correspondency to his purposes (of
   which afterward), not to be shaken or removed. Heb. i. 3; Rev. iv. 11;
   Acts xvii. 28, ii. 23, iv. 28; Gen. l. 20; Eccles. iii. 11. Men have
   their devices and counsels also, they are free agents, and work by
   counsel and advice; and therefore God hath not set all things so fast
   as to overturn and overbear them in their imaginations and
   undertakings. Saith the psalmist, "They imagine and devise indeed, but
   their counsel is of nought, and their devices are of none effect; but
   the counsel of the Lord," etc. The counsel and purposes of the Lord are
   set in opposition to the counsel and purposes of men, as to alteration,
   change, and frustration, in respect of the actual accomplishment of the
   things about which they are. "Their counsels are so and so; but the
   counsel of the Lord shall stand." He that shall cast verse 11 into
   verse 10, and say, "The counsel of the Lord, that comes to nought, and
   the thoughts of his heart are of none effect," let him make what
   pretences he will or flourishes that he can, or display what supposals
   and conditions he pleaseth, he will scarcely be able to keep the field
   against him who will contend with him about His prerogative and glory.
   And this antithesis between the counsels of men and the purposes of God
   upon the account of unchangeableness is again confirmed, Prov. xix. 21,
   "There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of
   the Lord, that shall stand." Herein is the difference between the
   devices of men and the counsel of God: Men have many devices to try
   what they can do. If one way take not, they will attempt another ("hac
   non successit, alia aggrediemur via"), and are always disappointed, but
   only in that wherein they fall in with the will of God. The shallowness
   of their understanding, the shortness of their foresight, the weakness
   of their power, the changeableness of their minds, the uncertainty of
   all the means they use, puts them upon many devices, and often to no
   purpose. [91] But for Him who is infinite in wisdom and power, to whom
   all things are present, and to whom nothing can fall out unexpected,
   yea, what he hath not himself determined, unto whom all emergencies are
   but the issue of his own good pleasure, who proportions out what
   efficacy he pleaseth unto the means he useth, -- his counsels, his
   purposes, his decrees shall stand, being, as Job [92] tells us, "as
   mountains of brass." By this he differenceth himself from all others,
   idols and men; as also by his certain foreknowledge of what shall come
   to pass and be accomplished upon those purposes of his. [93] Hence the
   apostle, Heb. vi. 17, 18, acquaints us that his promise and his oath,
   those "two immutable things," do but declare ametatheton tes boules,
   "the unchangeableness of his counsel;" which God is abundantly willing
   to manifest, though men are abundantly unwilling to receive it. Job
   determines this business in Job xxiii. 13, 14, "He is of one mind, and
   who can turn him? what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. For he
   performeth the thing that is appointed for me." Desires are the least
   and faintest kind of purposes, in Mr Goodwin's distinctions; yet the
   certain accomplishment of them, as they are ascribed unto God, is here
   asserted by the Holy Ghost.

   Were the confirmation of the matter of our present discourse my only
   design in hand, I could farther confirm it by enlarging these ensuing
   reasons:--

   First, From the immutability of God, the least questioning whereof
   falls foul on all the perfections of the divine nature, which require a
   correspondent affection of all the internal and eternal acts of his
   mind and will.

   Secondly, From his sovereignty, in making and executing all his
   purposes, which will not admit of any such mixture of consults or
   co-operations of others as should render his thoughts liable to
   alteration, Rom. xi. 33-36. The Lord in his purposes is considered as
   the great former of all things, who, having his clay in the hand of his
   almighty power, ordains every parcel to what kind of vessel and to what
   use he pleaseth. Hence the apostle concludes the consideration of them,
   and the distinguishing grace flowing from them, with that admiration, O
   Bathos! -- "O the depth!" etc.

   Thirdly, From their eternity, which exempts them from all shadow of
   change, and lifts them up above all those spheres that either from
   within and in their own nature, or from without by the impression of
   others, are exposed to turning. That which is eternal is also
   immutable, Acts xv. 18; 1 Cor. ii. 7-11.

   Fourthly, From the absoluteness and independency of his will, whereof
   they are the acts and emanations, Rom. ix. 15-21. Whatever hath any
   influence upon that, so as to move it, cause it, change it, must be
   before it, above it, better than it, as every cause is than its effect
   as such. This will of his, as was said, is the fountain of all being;
   to which free and independent act all creatures owe their being and
   subsistence, their operations and manner thereof, their whole
   difference from those worlds of beings which his power can produce, but
   which yet shall lie bound up to eternity in their nothingness and
   possibility, upon the account of his good pleasure. Into this doth our
   Saviour resolve the disposal of himself, Matt. xxvi. 42, and of all
   others, chap. xi. 25, 26. Certainly men in their wrangling disputes and
   contests about it have scarce seriously considered with whom they have
   to do. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou
   made me thus?'

   Fifthly, From the engagement of his omnipotency for the accomplishment
   of all his purposes and designs, as is emphatically expressed, Isa.
   xiv. 24-27, "The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have
   thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it
   stand: that I will break the Assyrian in my land. This is the purpose
   that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is
   stretched out upon all the nations. For the Lord of hosts hath
   purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and
   who shall turn it back?" The Lord doth not only assert the certain
   accomplishment of all his purposes, but also, to prevent and obviate
   the unbelief of them who were concerned in their fulfilling, he
   manifests upon what account it is that they shall certainly be brought
   to pass; and that is, by the stretching out of his hand, or exalting of
   his mighty power, for the doing of it; so that if there be a failing
   therein, it must be through the shortness of that hand of his so
   stretched out, in that it could not reach the end aimed at. A worm will
   put forth its strength for the fulfilling of that whereunto it is
   inclined; and the sons of men will draw out all their power for the
   compassing of their designs. If there be wisdom in the laying of them,
   and foresight of emergencies, they alter not, nor turn aside to the
   right hand or to the left, in the pursuit of them. And shall the
   infinitely wise, holy, and righteous thoughts and designs of God not
   have his power engaged for their accomplishment His infinite wisdom and
   understanding are at the foundation of them; they are the counsels of
   his will: Rom. xi. 34, "Who hath known his mind" in them? saith the
   apostle, "or who hath been his counsellor?" Though no creature can see
   the paths wherein he walks, nor apprehend the reason of the ways he is
   delighted in, yet this he lets us know, for the satisfying of our
   hearts and teaching of our inquiries, that his own infinite wisdom is
   in them all. I cannot but fear that sometimes men have" darkened
   counsel by words without knowledge," in curious contests about the
   decrees and purposes of God, as though they were to be measured by our
   rule and line, and as though "by searching we could find out the
   Almighty unto perfection." But he is wise in heart; he that contendeth
   with him, let him instruct him. Add, that this wisdom in his counsel is
   attended with infallible prescience of all that will fall in by the
   way, or in the course of the accomplishment of his purposes, and you
   will quickly see that there can be no possible intervenience, upon the
   account whereof the Lord should not engage his almighty power for their
   accomplishment. "He is of one mind, and who can turn him? He will work,
   and who shall let it?"

   Sixthly, By demonstrating the unreasonableness, folly, and
   impossibility, of suspending the acts and purposes of the will of God
   upon any actings of the creatures soever; seeing it cannot be done
   without subjecting eternity to time, the First Cause to the second, the
   Creator to the creature, the Lord to the servant, disturbing the whole
   order of beings and operations in the world.

   Seventhly, By the removal of all possible or imaginary causes of
   alteration and change, which will all be resolved into impotency in one
   kind or other; every alteration being confessedly an imperfection, it
   cannot follow but from want and weakness. Upon the issue of which
   discourse, if it might be pursued, these corollaries would ensue:--

   First, Conditional promises and threatenings are not declarative of
   God's purposes concerning persons, but of his moral approbation or
   rejection of things.

   Secondly, There is a wide difference between the change of what is
   conditionally pronounced as to the things themselves and the change of
   what is determinately willed, the certainty of whose event is
   proportioned to the immutable acts of the will of God itself.

   Thirdly, That no purpose of God is conditional, though the things
   themselves, concerning which his purposes are, are oftentimes
   conditionals one of another.

   Fourthly, That conditional purposes concerning perseverance are either
   impossible, implying contradictions, or ludicrous, even to an unfitness
   for a stage. But of these and such like, as they occasionally fall in,
   in the ensuing discourse.

   II. This foundation being laid, I come to what was secondly proposed,
   -- namely, to manifest, by an induction of particular instances, the
   engagement of these absolute and immutable purposes of God as to the
   preservation of the saints in his favour to the end; and whatsoever is
   by Mr Goodwin excepted as to the former doctrine of the decrees and
   purposes of God, in that part of his treatise which falls under our
   consideration, shall, in the vindication of the respective places of
   Scripture to be insisted on, be discussed.

   The first particular instance that I shall propose is that eminent
   place of the apostle, Rom. viii. 28, where you have the truth in hand
   meted out unto us, full measure, shaken together, and running over. It
   doth not hang by the side of his discourse, nor is left to be gathered
   and concluded from other principles and assertions couched therein, but
   is the main of the apostolical drift and design, it being proposed by
   him to make good, upon unquestionable grounds, the assurance he gives
   believers that "all things work together for good to them that love
   God, to them who are the called according to his purpose;" the reason
   whereof he farther adds in the following words: "For whom he did
   foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
   Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover whom
   he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he
   also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified." What
   the good aimed at is, for which all things shall work together, and
   wherein it doth consist, he manifests in the conclusion of the argument
   produced to prove his first assertion: Verses 35-39, "Who shall
   separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation," etc. The good
   of believers:, of them that love God, consists in the enjoyment of
   Christ and his love. Saith, then, the apostle, "God will so certainly
   order all things that they shall be preserved in that enjoyment of it
   whereunto in this life they are already admitted, and borne out through
   all oppositions to that perfect fruition thereof which they aim at; and
   this is so unquestionable, that the very things which seem to lie in
   the way of such an attainment and event shall work together, through
   the wisdom and love of God, to that end." To make good this
   consolation, the apostle lays down two grounds or principles from
   whence the truth of it doth undeniably follow, the one taken from the
   description of the persons concerning whom he makes it, and the other
   from the acts of God's grace, and their respective concatenation in
   reference to those persons.

   The persons, he tells you, are those who are "called according to God's
   purpose." That their calling here mentioned is the effectual call of
   God, which is answered by faith and obedience, because it consists in
   the bestowing of them on the persons so called, taking away the heart
   of stone and giving a heart of flesh, is not only manifest from that
   place which afterward [it] receives in the golden chain of divine
   graces, between predestination and justification, whereby the one hath
   infallible influences into the other, but also from that previous
   description which is given of the same persons, namely, that they love
   God, which certainly is an issue and fruit of effectual calling, as
   shall afterward be farther argued; for to that issue are things driven
   in this controversy, that proofs thereof are become needful.

   The "purpose" according to which these persons are called is none other
   than that which the apostle, chap. ix. 11, terms the "purpose of God
   according to election;" the "election of grace," chap. xi. 5; as also
   the knowledge and "foundation of God," 2 Tim. ii. 19; as will in the
   progress of our discourse be made farther appear, although I know not
   that this is as yet questioned. The immutability of this purpose of
   God, chap. ix. 11, 12, the apostle demonstrates from its independency
   on any thing in them or in respect of them concerning whom it is, it
   being eternal, and expressly safeguarded against apprehensions that
   might arise of any causal or occasional influence from any thing in
   them given thereunto, they lying under this condition alone unto God,
   as persons that had done neither good nor evil. And this, also, the
   apostle farther pursues from the sovereignty, absoluteness, and
   unchangeableness of the will of God. But these things are of another
   consideration.

   Now, this unchangeable purpose and election being the fountain from
   whence the effectual calling of believers doth flow, the preservation
   of them to the end designed, the glory whereunto they are chosen, by
   those acts of grace and love whereby they are prepared thereunto, hath
   coincidence of infallibility as to the end aimed at with the purpose
   itself, nor is it liable to the least exception but what may be raised
   from the mutability and changeableness of God in his purposes and
   decrees. Hence, in the following verse, upon the account of the
   stability and immutability of this purpose of God, the utmost and most
   remote end in reference to the good thereby designed unto believers,
   though having its present subsistence only in that purpose of God and
   infallible concatenation of means thereunto conducing, is mentioned as
   a thing actually accomplished, Rom. viii. 30.

   Herein, also, lies the apostle's second eviction of consolation
   formerly laid down, even in the indissoluble concatenation of those
   acts of grace, love, and favour, whereby the persons of God's purpose,
   or the "remnant according to the election of grace," shall be
   infallibly carried on in their present enjoyment and unto the full
   fruition of the love of Christ. If we may take him upon his word (and
   he speaks in the name and authority of God), those whom he doth
   foreknow, or fixes his thoughts peculiarly upon from eternity (for the
   term these is evidently discriminated, and the act must needs be
   eternal which in order of nature is previous unto predestination, or
   the appointment to the end by means designed), those, I say, he doth
   predestinate and appoint, in the immutable purpose of his will, to be
   conformed unto the image of his Son, as in afflictions, so in grace and
   glory.

   To fancy a suspension of these acts of grace (some whereof are eternal)
   upon conditionals, and they not intimated in the least in the text, nor
   consistent with the nature of the things themselves or the end
   intended, casting the accomplishment and bringing about of the designs
   of God, proposed as his for our consolation, upon the certain lubricity
   of the wills of men, and thereupon to propose an intercision of them as
   to their concatenation and dependence, that they should not have a
   certain influence on the one hand descending, nor an unchangeable
   dependence on the other ascending, may easily be made to appear to be
   so plain an opposition to the aim and design of the apostle as it is
   possibly capable of. But because these things are really insisted on by
   Mr Goodwin, I shall choose rather to remove them, -- as with much
   rhetoric, and not without some sophistry, they are by him pressed, --
   than farther anticipate them, by arguments from the text itself, of
   their invalidity and nullity.

   The discussion of our argument from this place of Scripture he enters
   upon, chap. x. sect. 42, p. 207, and pursues it, being much entangled
   with what himself is pleased to draw forth as the strength of it, unto
   sect. 52, p. 219.

   Now, though Mr Goodwin hath not at all mentioned any analysis of the
   place insisted on, for the making out of the truth we believe, to be
   intended in it, nor ever once showed his reader the face of our
   argument from hence, but only drawn something of it forth in such
   divided parcels as he apprehended himself able to blur and obscure, yet
   to make it evident that he hath not prevailed to foil that part of the
   strength of truth (his adversary) which he voluntarily chose to grapple
   withal, I shall consider that whole discourse, and manifest the nullity
   of his exceptions unto this testimony given in by the apostle to the
   truth we have in hand.

   To obtain his end, Mr Goodwin undertaketh these two things:-- first, To
   give in an exposition of the place of Scripture insisted on, "whence no
   such conclusion as that which he opposeth," saith he, "can be drawn;"
   secondly, To give in exceptions to our interpretation of it, and the
   inferences thereupon by us deduced. The first [is] in these, words:--

   "For the scope of the apostle, in the sequel of this passage, is
   clearly this, as the particle for' in the beginning of verse 29 plainly
   showeth, to prove and make good that assertion of his, verse 28, that
   all things work together for good to those that love God.' To prove
   this he showeth by what method and degrees of dispensations God will
   bring it to pass. Whom he foreknows,' saith he, that is, pre-approves
   (the word knowledge' frequently in Scripture importing approbation), as
   he must needs do those that love him, these he predestinates to be
   conformed to the image of his Son;' and therefore as all things, even
   his deepest sufferings, wrought together for good unto him, so must
   they needs do unto those who are predestinated or pre-ordinated by God
   to a conformity with him. To give you yet,' saith our apostle, a
   farther and more particular account how God, in the secret of his
   counsels, hath laid things in order to the bringing of them unto an
   actual conformity with the image of his Son, to wit, in glory, whom he
   predestinated thereunto (who are such as love him, and thereupon are
   approved by him), you are to understand that whom he hath so
   predestinated he hath also called, -- that is, hath purposed or decreed
   to call to the knowledge of his Son or of his gospel, -- that is, to
   afford a more plain and effectual discovery of him unto them than unto
   others whom he hath not so predestinated.' By the way, this call doth
   not necessarily suppose a saving answer given unto it by the called, no
   whit more than the calling mentioned, Matt. xx. 16, xxii. 14. It only
   supposeth a real purpose on God's part to make it very sufficient to
   procure such an answer to it from those that are called. The apostle
   advanceth towards his proposed end, and addeth, Those whom he called,
   them he also justified;' that is, according to our last exposition of
   the word called,' he hath purposed or decreed to justify, -- to wit, in
   case the called obstruct him not in his way, or by their unbelief
   render not themselves incapable of justification. The clause following
   is likewise to be understood with the like proviso as this: Whom he
   hath justified, them he also glorified;' that is, hath purposed or
   decreed to save, in case they retain the grace of justification,
   confirmed upon them to the end."

   Ans. First, let it be granted that the design of the apostle is to make
   good that assertion, "All things work together for good to them that
   love God," and the consolation for believers which thence he holds
   forth unto them; yet he doth not only show by what method, degrees, or
   steps, God will bring it to pass, but also, as the fountain of all that
   ensues, lays down the unalterable purpose of God concerning that end,
   which is intended in and accomplished by all those steps or degrees of
   his effectual grace after mentioned. This Mr Goodwin passeth over, as
   not to be wrested into any tolerable conformity with that sense (if
   there be any sense in the whole of what he insists upon for the sense
   of this place) which he intends to rack and press the words unto. To
   save stumbling at the threshold (which is malum omen), he leaps at once
   over the consideration of this purpose and design of God, as aiming at
   a certain end, without the least touch upon it. Farther, that God will
   bring it to pass that all things shall work together for good to them
   that love him, is not intended by Mr Goodwin as though it should
   infallibly be so indeed, but only that God will so way-lay them with
   some advantages that it may be so, as well as otherwise. What
   consolation believers may receive from this whole discourse of the
   apostle, intended properly to administer it unto them, as it lies under
   the gloss ensuing, shall be discovered in our following consideration
   of it. Thus, then, he makes it out:--

   "Whom he foreknows, that is, pre-approves (the word knowledge' in
   Scripture frequently importing approbation), as he must needs do those
   that love him, them he predestinates."

   Ans. First, That to "know" is sometimes taken in Scripture for to
   approve may be granted; but that the word here used must therefore
   signify to pre-approve is an assertion which I dare not pretend to so
   much foreknowledge as to think that any one besides himself will
   approve. Mr Goodwin, I doubt not, knows full well that prepositions in
   Greek composition do often restrain simple verbs, formerly at liberty
   for other uses, to one precise signification. The word proginosko, in
   its constant sense in other authors, is "præscio" or "prædecerno;"
   ginosko itself, "to determine or decree;" so is "scisco" among the
   Latins, the ancient word "to know." So he in Plautus: "Rogitationes
   plurimas propter vos populus scivit, quas vos rogates rumpitis." [94]
   And nothing more frequent in Cicero. "Quæ scisceret plebs, aut quæ
   populus juberet," etc.; and again, "Quod multa perniciose, multa
   pestifere sciscuntur in populus;" and, "Plancus primus legem scivit de
   publicanis." [95] In like manner is ginosko frequently used: Egnosan
   touto me poiein? -- "They determined not to do that thing." [96] Adika
   egnoke peri emou ho Zeus, says he in Lucian; -- "He hath determined
   unrighteous things against me." [97] Hence, gnome is often taken for a
   decree, or an established purpose, as Budæus manifesteth out of
   Plutarch. In Scripture the word is sundry times used, and still in the
   sense before mentioned; sometimes for a simple foreknowledge. So Paul
   uses it of the Jews who knew him before his conversion: Acts xxvi. 5,
   Proginoskontes. It relates not to what they foreknew, but what they
   knew before, or in former days. And as the simple verb, as was showed,
   is often taken for "decerno, statuo," "to decree, order, or determine,"
   so with this composition it seems most to be restrained to that sense.
   1 Pet. i. 20, it is said of Christ that he was proegnosmenos pro
   kataboles kosmou, -- he was "foreknown," or "fore-ordained, before the
   foundation of the world;' which is opposed to that which follows,
   phanerotheis de ep' eschaton ton chronon di' humas, -- "manifested in
   the last times for you," -- and relates to the decree or fore-purpose
   of God concerning the giving of his Son. Hence prognosis is joined with
   horismene boule, God's "determinate counsel," as a word of the same
   importance: Acts ii. 23, Touton de horismene boule kai prognosei, etc.:
   if there be any difference, the first designing the wisdom, the latter
   the will, of God in this business. In Rom. xi. 2 it hath again the same
   signification: "God hath not cast off ton laon hautou hon proegno," or
   the remnant which among the obstinate and unbelieving Jews were under
   his everlasting purpose of grace; in which place, causelessly and
   without any attempt of proof, the Remonstrants wrest the word to
   signify pre-approbation, Dec. Sent., art. 1, the whole context and
   design of the apostle, the terms "remnant" and "election," whereby the
   same thing is afterward expressed, undeniably forcing the proper
   acceptation of the word. Not only the original sense and composition of
   the word, but also the constant use of it in the Scripture, leads us
   away from the interpretation here pinned upon it.

   Farther; what is the meaning of pre-approving? God's approving of any
   person as to their persons is his free and gracious acceptation of them
   in Christ. His pre-approving of them in answer hereunto must be his
   eternal gracious acceptation of them in Christ. But is this Mr
   Goodwin's intendment? Doth God accept any in Christ antecedently to
   their predestination, calling, and justification (for they are all
   consequential to this act of pre-approbation)? This, then, is that
   which is affirmed: God approves and accepts of men in Christ; thereupon
   he predestinates, calls, and justifies them. But what need [for] all
   these if they be antecedently accepted? I should have expected that
   this foreknowledge should have been resolved rather into a middle or
   conditionate prescience than into this pre-approbation, but that our
   great masters were pleased (in the place newly cited), though without
   any attempt of proof, to carry it another way. That God should approve
   of, love, accept persons, antecedently to their predestination,
   vocation, and justification, is, doubtless, not suitable to Mr
   Goodwin's principles; but that they should love God also before they
   fall under these acts of his grace is not only openly contradictions to
   the truth, but also to itself. The phrase here of "loving God" is
   confessedly a description of believers; now, to suppose men believers,
   that is, to answer the call of God, antecedently to his call, will
   scarce be salved from a flat contradiction with any reserved
   considerations that may be invented.

   This solid foundation being laid, he proceeds: "Those who thus love
   him, and he approves of them, he predestinates to be conformed to the
   image of his Son." It is true, the apostle speaks of them and to them
   that "love God," but doth not, in the least, suppose them as such to be
   the objects of the acts of his sovereign grace after mentioned. If God
   call none but those that love him antecedently to his call, that grace
   of his must eternally rest in his own bosom, without the least exercise
   of it towards any of the sons of men. It is those persons, indeed, who,
   in the process of the work of God's grace towards them, are brought to
   love him, that are thus predestinated and called; but they are so dealt
   withal, not upon the account or consideration of their love of God
   (which is not only in order consequential to some of them, but the
   proper effect and product of them), but upon the account of the
   unchangeable purpose of God appointing them to salvation; -- which I
   doubt not but Mr Goodwin studiously and purposely omitted to insist
   upon, knowing its absolute inconsistency with the conclusion (and yet
   not able to waive it, had it been once brought under consideration)
   which from the words he aimeth to extract. As, then, to make men's
   loving of God to be antecedent to the grace of vocation is an express
   contradiction in itself; so to make it, or the consideration of it, to
   be previous unto predestination is an insinuation of a gross Pelagian
   figment, giving rise and spring to God's eternal predestination, not in
   his own sovereign will, but the self-differencing wills of men. "Latet
   anguis" also in the adding "grass" of that exegetical term
   "pre-ordinated," -- predestinated, that is, pre-ordinated. Though the
   word, being considered in the language whereof it is, seems not to give
   occasion to any suspicion, yet the change of it from pre-ordained into
   pre-ordinated is not to be supposed to be for nothing in him who is
   expert at these weapons To ordain is either "ordinare ut aliquid fiat,"
   or "ordinem in factis statuere," or, according to some, "subjectum
   disponere ad finem." To pre-ordain is of necessity precisely tied up to
   the first sense; -- to pre-ordinate, I fear, in Mr Goodwin's sense, is
   but to predispose men by some good inclinations in themselves, and men
   pre-ordinated are but men so predisposed; which is the usual gloss that
   men of this persuasion put upon Acts xiii. 48.

   Thus far, then, we have carried on the sense affixed to these words, if
   it may so be called, which is evidently contradictious in itself, and
   in no one particular suited to the mind of the Holy Ghost.

   He proceeds: "?To give you yet,' saith our apostle, a farther and more
   particular account how God, in the secret of his counsel, hath belaid
   things in order,'?" etc.

   This expression, "God hath belaid things in order to the salvation of
   them that love him," is the whole of the assurance here given by the
   apostle to the assertion formerly laid down for the consolation of
   believers; and this, according to the analogy and proportion of our
   author's faith, amounts only thus far: "You that love God, if you
   continue so to do, you will fall under his predestination; and if you
   abide under that, he will call you, so as that you may farther obey
   him, or you may not. If you do obey him, and believe upon his call
   (having loved him before), he will justify you; not with that
   justification which is final, of which you may come short, but with
   initial justification; which if you continue in and walk up unto,
   solvite curas when you are dead in your graves." This is called God's
   belaying of things in his secret counsel; whereby the total
   accomplishment of the first engagement is cut off from the root of
   God's purposes, and from the branches of his effectual grace in the
   pursuit thereof, and grafted upon the wild olive of the will of man,
   that never did, nor ever will, bear any wholesome fruit of itself to
   eternity. What is afterward added of the qualification of those whom
   God predestinates, being an intrusion of another false hypothesis, for
   the confirmation of an assertion of the same alloy, is not of my
   present consideration. But he adds, "Ye are to understand that whom he
   hath predestinated he hath also called, hath purposed or decreed to
   call, to the knowledge of his Son, or his gospel," as before, etc.

   Ans. How he hath predestinated them is not expressed, but being so
   predestinated, God purposes to call them; -- that is, them and only
   them; for it is a uniform proceeding of God towards all whom he
   attempts to bring to himself which is here described. That is, when men
   love him and are approved of him, and are thereupon pre-ordinated to
   conformity with Christ, then he decrees to call them, or, as the
   calling here mentioned is described (that ye may not mistake, as though
   any internal effectual work of grace were hereby intended, but only an
   outward moral persuasion, by a revelation of the object they should
   embrace), "he gives a more plain and effectual discovery of Christ to
   them than to any others." Doubtless it is evident to every one that
   (besides the great confusion whereinto the proceedings of God in
   bringing sinners to himself, or belaying their coming with some kind
   entertainments, are cast) the whole work of salvation is resolved into
   the wills of men; and instead of an effectual, operative, unchangeable
   purpose of God, nothing is left on his part but a moral approbation of
   what is well done, and a proposing of other desirable things unto men
   upon the account of former worthy carriage. And this is no small part
   of the intendment of our author in this undertaking.

   That God decrees to call them, and only them, who love him, and upon
   that account are approved of him, when all faith and love are the
   fruits of that calling of his, is such a figment as I shall not need to
   cast away words in the confutation of it. [98]

   Yet, lest any should have too high thoughts of this grace of vocation,
   he tells them by the way "that it doth not necessarily suppose a saving
   answer given to it by the called, no whit more than the calling
   mentioned, Matt. xx. 16, xxii. 14."

   First, By Mr Goodwin's confession there is as yet no great advance made
   towards the proof of the assertion laid down in the entrance, and for
   the confirmation whereof this series and concatenation of divine graces
   is insisted on. Though men love God, are predestinated and accepted,
   yet when it comes to calling they may stop there and perish
   everlastingly; for "many are called, but few chosen." They are indeed
   belaid by a calling, but they may miss the place of its residence, or
   refuse to accept of its entertainment, and pass on to ruin. But, --

   Secondly, They are so called as upon the account thereof to be
   justified; for "whom he calls, them he also justifies." "Yea, in case
   they obey." But this is the interpretation of the new apostle, not the
   old; neither hath the text any such supposition, nor will the context
   bear it, nor can the design of the apostle consist with it, nor any
   more consolation be squeezed from this place upon the account of it
   than of milk from a flint in the rock of stone. Neither, --

   Thirdly, Doth the calling here mentioned hold any analogy with that of
   the many that are called but not chosen, pointed at in the second place
   instanced in, being indeed the effectual calling of the few who are
   chosen: for as our Saviour, in those places of Matthew, mentioned two
   sorts of persons, some that have a general call, but are not chosen,
   and others that, being chosen, are therefore distinguished from the
   former as to their vocation; so Paul here tells you that the calling he
   insists on is the peculiar call of God "according to his purpose" (the
   same purpose intimated by our Saviour); which, being suited of God to
   the carrying on and accomplishing of that purpose of his, must be
   effectual, unless he through mutability and impotency come short of
   accomplishing the design of his will and wisdom.

   Neither is this salved by what follows, "that it is the intention of
   God to make this call sufficient for the end purposed;" yea, this part
   of the wallet is most filled with folly and falsehood: for as general
   purposes of giving means for an end, with an intention to bring that
   end about, that may or may not attain it, are most remote from God,
   and, being supposed, are destructive to all his holy and blessed
   attributes and perfections, as hath been shown; so the thing itself, of
   sufficient grace of vocation, which is not effectual, is a gross
   figment, not, whilst this world continues, by Mr Goodwin to be made
   good, the most of his arguments being importunate suggestions of his
   own hypothesis and conceptions. But he goes on, --

   "The apostle advanceth towards his proposed end, and adds, Those whom
   he called, them he also justified,' or decreed to justify, in case the
   called obstruct him not in his way, or by their unbelief render not
   themselves incapable of justification."

   Ans. That exception, "In case they obstruct him not," is a clue to lead
   us into all the corners of this labyrinth, and a key to the whole
   design in hand. Such a supposal it is as not only enervates the whole
   discourse of the apostle and frustrates his design, but also opens a
   door for the questioning of the accomplishment of any purpose or
   promise of God whatever, and, in one word, rejects the whole efficacy
   of the grace of the gospel, as a thing of naught. What strength is
   there in the discourse and arguing of the apostle, from the purpose and
   ensuing series of God's grace, to prove that "all things shall work
   together for good to them that love God," if the whole issue and event
   of things mentioned to that end depend not on the efficacy or effectual
   influences of those acts of God, one upon another, and all upon the
   end, they being all and every one of them, jointly and severally,
   suspended upon the wills of the persons themselves concerning whom they
   are (which yet here is concealed, and [not] intimated in the least)?
   How doth it prove at all that they shall never be separated from the
   love of Christ, that they shall be made conformable to him in glory,
   notwithstanding all opposition, upon the account of the dispensation of
   God's eternal and actual love towards them, when the whole of their
   usefulness to the end proposed is resolved ultimately into themselves
   and their endeavours, and not into any purpose or set of God? Such as
   is the foundation, such is the strength of the whole building.
   Inferences can have no more strength than the principle from whence
   they are deduced. If a man should tell another that if he will go a
   journey of a hundred miles, at each twenty miles' end he shall meet
   with such and such refreshments, all the consolation he can receive
   upon the account of refreshments provided for him is proportioned only
   to the thoughts he hath of his own strength for the performance of that
   journey.

   Farther; if in such expressions of the purposed works of God, we may
   put cases and trust in what supposals we think good, where there is not
   the least jot, tittle, or syllable of them in the text, nor any room
   for them, without destroying not only the design and meaning of the
   place, but the very sense of it, why may not we do so in other
   undertakings of God, the certainty of whose event depends upon his
   purpose and promise only? For instance, the resurrection of the dead:
   may we not say, God will raise up the dead in Christ, in case there be
   any necessity that their bodies should be glorified? What is it, also,
   that remains of praise to the glorious grace of God? This is all he
   effects by it: In case men obstruct him not in his way, it doth good.
   God calls men to faith and obedience; in case they obstruct not his
   way, it shall do them good. But how do they obstruct his way? By
   unbelief and disobedience: take them away, and God's calling shall be
   effectual to them. That is, in case they believe and obey, God's
   calling shall be effectual to cause them to believe and obey!

   The cases then foisted into the apostle's discourse, in the close of
   this interpretation of the place (if I may so call it), -- namely, that
   God will justify the called in case they obstruct not his way, and will
   glorify them whom he hath justified in ease they continue and abide in
   the state of justification, -- are, first, thrust in without ground,
   warrant, or colour of advantage, or occasion given by any thing in the
   text or context; -- and, secondly, are destructive to the whole design
   of the Holy Ghost in the place whereinto they are intruded; injurious
   to the truth of the assertion intended to be made good, that "all
   things shall work together for good," proposed upon the account of the
   unchangeable purpose of God, and infallible connection of the acts of
   his love and grace in the pursuit thereof; and resolve the promised
   work and designed event wholly into the uncertain, lubricous wills of
   men, making the assurance given not only to be liable to just
   exceptions, but evidently to fail and be falsified in respect of
   thousands; -- and, thirdly, render the whole dispensation of the grace
   of God to lackey after the wills of men, and wholly to depend upon
   them, giving in thereby, as was said, innumerable presumptions that the
   word, for whose confirmation all these acts of God's grace are
   mentioned and insisted on, shall never be made good or established.

   Take, then, in a few words, the sense and scope of this place, as it is
   held out in the exposition given of it by Mr Goodwin, and we will then
   proceed to consider his confirmations of the said exposition: "O ye
   that love God, many afflictions, temptations, and oppositions, ye shall
   meet withal; but be of good comfort, all shall work together for your
   good, for God hath appointed you to be like his Son, and ye may triumph
   in every condition on this account. For if ye, before any act of his
   special grace towards you, love him, he approves you, and then he
   predestinates you" (what that is I know not). "Then it is in your power
   to continue to love him, or to do otherwise. If ye abide not, then ye
   perish: if ye abide, he will call you. And when he doth so, either ye
   may obey him or ye may not, If ye do not, all things shall work
   together for your hurt, and ye will be like the devil; -- if ye do,
   then he will justify you; and then, if ye abide with him, as perhaps ye
   may, perhaps ye may not, he will finally justify you, and then all
   shall be well." This being the substance of the interpretation of this
   place here given, let us now consider how it is confirmed.

   That which, in his own terms, he undertaketh to "demonstrate," and to
   "vindicate from all objections," in his ensuing discourse, he thus
   expresseth, page 209, sect. 43: "These decrees, or purposed acts of
   God, here specified, are to be understood in their successive
   dependencies, with such a condition or proviso respectively as those
   mentioned, and not absolutely, peremptorily, or without condition."

   Ans. The imposing of conditions and provisos upon the decrees and
   purposes of God, of which himself gives not the least intimation, and
   the suspending them, as to their execution, on those conditions so
   invented and imposed, at the first view reflects so evidently on the
   will, wisdom, power, prescience, and unchangeableness of God, who hath
   said, "his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure,"
   especially when the interruption of them doth frustrate the whole
   design and aim of God in the mentioning of those decrees and purposes
   of his, that there will be need of demonstrations written with the
   beams of the sun to enforce men tender and regardful of the honour and
   glory of God to close with any in such an undertaking. Let us, then,
   consider what is produced to this end, and try if it will hold weight
   in the balance of the sanctuary. "This," saith he, "appears, --

   "First, By the like phrase or manner of expression, frequent in the
   Scripture elsewhere. I mean, when such purposes or decrees of God, the
   respective execution whereof is suspended upon such and such
   conditions, are, notwithstanding, simply and positively, without any
   mention of condition, expressed and asserted: Wherefore the Lord God of
   Israel saith, I said indeed that try house, and the house of thy
   father, shall walk before me' (meaning in the office and dignity of the
   priesthood) for ever: but now saith the Lord, Be it far from me.' I
   said indeed;' that is, I verily purposed or decreed,' or I promised:'
   it comes much to one. When God made the promise, and so declared his
   promise accordingly, that Eli and his father's house should walk before
   him for ever, he expressed no condition as required to the execution or
   performance of it, yet here it plainly appears that there was a
   condition understood. In the same kind of dialect Samuel speaks to
   Saul: Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of
   the Lord thy God: for now the Lord had established try kingdom upon
   Israel for ever; but now try kingdom shall not continue.' The Lord had
   established;' that is, he verily purposed or decreed to establish it
   for ever, -- to wit, in case his posterity had walked obediently with
   him."

   Here we have the strength (as will be manifest in the progress of our
   discourse) of what Mr Goodwin hath to make good his former strange
   assertion. Whether it will amount to a necessary proof or no may appear
   upon these ensuing considerations:--

   First, The reason intimated being taken neither from the text under
   debate, nor the context, nor any other place where any concernment of
   the doctrine therein contained is touched or pointed at, there being
   also no coincidence of phrase or expression in the one place and the
   other here compared, I cannot but admire by what rules of
   interpretation Mr Goodwin doth proceed to make one of these places
   exegetical of the other. Though this way of arguing hath been mainly
   and almost solely insisted on of late by the Socinians, -- namely,
   "Such a word is in another place used to another purpose, or in another
   sense, therefore this cannot be the necessary sense of it in this," --
   yet it is not only confuted over and over as irrational and
   unconcluding, but generally exploded as an invention suited only to
   shake all certainty whatever in matters of faith and revelation. Mr
   Goodwin in his instance goes not so far (or rather he goes farther,
   because his instance goes not so far), there being no likeness, much
   less sameness of expression, in those texts which he produces to weaken
   the obvious and literally-exposed sense of the other insisted on
   therewith.

   To waive the force of the inference from the words of the Holy Ghost
   (seeing nothing in the least intimated in the place will give in any
   assistance thereunto), first, this thesis is introduced: "The purposes
   and decrees of God (confessedly engaged in the place in hand) are, as
   to their respective executions, suspended on conditions in men;" -- an
   assertion destructive to the power, goodness, grace, righteousness,
   faithfulness, wisdom, unchangeableness, providence, and sovereignty, of
   God, as might be demonstrated did it now lie in our way. To prove that
   this must needs be so, and that that rule must take place in the
   mention that is made of the purposes and decrees of God, Rom. viii.
   28-30, 1 Sam. ii. 30 is produced, being a denunciation of God's
   judgments upon the house of Eli for their unworthy walking in the
   honour of the priesthood, whereunto they were by him advanced and
   called, and which they were intrusted withal, expressly upon condition
   of their obedience.

   Let us, then, a little consider the correspondency that is between the
   places compared for their mutual illustration:--

   First, In the one there is express mention of the purpose of God, and
   that his eternal purpose; in the other, only a promise, expressly
   conditional in the giving of it, amounting to no more than a law,
   without the least intimation of any purpose or decree.

   Secondly, The one encompasseth the whole design of the grace of the
   gospel; the other mentions not any special grace at all.

   Thirdly, The one is wholly expressive of the acts of God, and his
   design therein; the other declarative of the duty of man, with the
   issue, thereupon depending.

   This, then, is the strength of this argument: "God, approving the
   obedience of a man, tells him that upon the continuance of that
   obedience in him and his, he will continue them an office in his
   service (a temporal mercy, which might be enjoyed without the least
   saving grace); and which upon his disobedience he threateneth to take
   from him (both promise and threatening being declarative of his
   approbation of obedience, and his annexing the priesthood thereunto in
   that family): therefore God, intending the consolation of elect
   believers, affirms that all things shall work together for their good,
   upon this account, that he hath eternally purposed to preserve them in
   his love, and to bring them to himself by such effectual acts of his
   grace as whose immutable dependence one upon the other, and all upon
   his own purpose, cannot be interrupted, and therefore such as shall
   infallibly produce and work in them all the obedience which for the end
   proposed he requires; -- his purpose, I say, thus mentioned, must be of
   the same import with the declaration of his will in the other place
   spoken of." If such a confounding of the decrees and denunciations,
   absolute purposes and conditional promises, spiritual things with
   temporal, and the general administration of the covenant of grace in
   Christ with special providential dispensations, may be allowed, there
   is no man needs to despair of proving any thing he hath a mind to
   assert.

   Secondly, There are two things that Mr Goodwin insists upon, to make
   good his arguing from this place:-- First, That these words, "I said
   indeed," hold out the real purpose and decree of God. Secondly, That in
   the promise mentioned there was no condition expressed or required to
   the execution or performance of it.

   By the first he intends that God did really purpose and decree from
   eternity that Eli and his house should hold the priesthood for ever; by
   the second, that no condition was expressed, either in terms, or
   necessarily implied in the thing itself, which is of the same import.

   If neither of these, now, should prove true, what little advance Mr
   Goodwin hath made for the weakening of the plain intendment of the
   words in the place under consideration, or for the confirmation of his
   own gloss and interposed conditionals, either by this or the following
   instances, that are of the same kind, will plainly appear. Now, that
   these words, "I said indeed," are not declarative of an eternal decree
   and purpose of God concerning the futurition and event of what is
   asserted to be the object of that decree, the continuance of the
   priesthood in the house of Eli, may be evidenced, as from the general
   nature of the things themselves, so from the particular explanation of
   the act of God whereunto this expression, "I said indeed," doth relate.

   First, From the general nature of the thing itself this may be
   manifested. To what hath been formerly spoken I shall add only some few
   considerations, being not willing to insist long on that which is but
   collateral to my present design.

   First, then, When God decreed and purposed this (if so be he purposed
   it, as it is said he did), he either foresaw what would be the issue of
   it, or he did not. If he did not, where is his infinite wisdom and
   understanding? -- if we may not be allowed to say his foreknowledge.
   How are "all his works known to him from the beginning of the world?"
   [99] How doth he "declare the end from the beginning, and the things
   that are yet to come?" distinguishing himself from all false gods on
   this account, If he did foresee the event, that it would not be so, why
   did he decree and purpose it should be so? Doth this become the
   infinite wisdom of God, to purpose and decree from all eternity that
   that shall come to pass which he knows will never come to pass? Can any
   such resolution fall upon the sons of men, to whom God is pleased to
   continue the use of that little spark of reason wherewith they are
   endued? If you say, "God purposed it should continue in case their
   disobedience hindered it not," I ask again, Did God foresee the
   disobedience that would so hinder it, or did he not? If he did not, the
   same difficulties will arise which formerly I mentioned. If he did,
   then God decreed and purposed that the priesthood should continue in
   the house of Eli, if they kept themselves from that disobedience which
   he saw and knew full well they would run into! Cui fini?

   Secondly, If God did thus purpose and decree, he was able to bring it
   about, and accomplish his design by ways agreeable to his goodness,
   wisdom, and righteousness, or he was not. If he was not, where is his
   omnipotency, who is not able to fulfil his righteous designs and
   purposes in ways corresponding to that state of agents and things which
   he hath allotted them? How can it be said of him, "He will work, and
   none shall let him?" That God engageth his power for the accomplishment
   of his purposes was showed before. If he were able to accomplish it,
   why did he not do it, but suffer himself to he frustrated of his end?
   Is it suitable to the sovereign will and wisdom of God eternally to
   purpose and decree that which, by means agreeable to his holiness and
   goodness, he is able to bring to pass, and yet not to do it, but to
   fail and come short of his holy and gracious intendment?

   Thirdly, The obedience of the house of Eli, on which the accomplishment
   of the pretended decree is suspended, was such as either they were able
   of themselves to perform, or they were not. To say they were, is to
   exclude the necessary assistance of the grace of God, which Mr Goodwin
   hath not in terms declared himself to do, nor are we as yet arrived at
   that height, though a considerable progress hath been made. If they
   were not able to do it without the assistance of the Spirit and
   concurrence of the grace of God, did the Lord purpose to give them that
   assistance, working in them both to will and to do of his own good
   pleasure, or did he not? If he did so purpose, why did he not do it? If
   he did not purpose to do it, to what end did he decree that that should
   come to pass which he knew could not come to pass without his doing
   that which he was resolved newer to do? It is all one as if a man knew
   that another were shut up in a prison, from whence it was impossible
   that any body but himself should deliver him, and should resolve and
   purpose to give the poor prisoner a hundred pounds, so that he would
   come out of prison to him, and resolve withal never to bring him out.

   Fourthly, God from eternity foresaw that the priesthood should not be
   continued to the house of Eli; therefore he did not from eternity
   purpose and decree that it should. To know that a thing shall not be,
   and to determine that it shall be, is a schesis rather beseeming a half
   frantic creature than the infinitely wise Creator. Again; upon what
   account did God foresee that it should not be so? Can the futurition of
   contingent events be resolved in the issue into any thing but God's
   sovereign determination? God, therefore, did not determine and purpose
   that it should be so, because he determined and purposed that it should
   not be so. Whatsoever he doth in time, that he purposed to do from
   eternity. Now, in time he removed the priesthood from the house of Eli;
   therefore he eternally purposed and determined so to do: which surely
   leaves no place for a contrary purpose and decree (not so much as
   conditional) that it should so continue for ever. The truth is, the
   mystery of this abomination lies in those things which lie not in my
   way now to handle. A disjunctive decree, a middle science,
   creature-dependency, are father, mother, and nurse, of the assertion we
   oppose, whose monstrous deformity and desperate rebellion against the
   properties of God I may, the Lord assisting, hereafter more fully
   demonstrate.

   But you will say, "Doth not the Lord plainly hold out a purpose and
   decree in these words, I said indeed?' Did he say it? Will you assign
   hypocrisy to him, and doubling with the sons of men?"

   I say, then, secondly, that the expression here used holds out no
   intention or purpose of God as to the futurition and event of the thing
   itself, that the priesthood should continue in the house of Eli, but
   only his purpose and intention that obedience and the priesthood should
   go together. There is a connection of things, not an intendment or
   purpose of events, in the words intimated. The latter cannot be
   ascribed to God without the charge of as formal mutability as the
   poorest creature is liable to. Mr Goodwin, indeed, tells you, sect. 43,
   p. 209, "That the purpose of God itself, considered as an act or
   conception of the mind of God, dependeth not on any condition whatever;
   and all God's purposes and decrees, without exception, are in such
   respect absolute and independent." How weak and unable this is to free
   the Lord from a charge of changeableness upon his supposal needs little
   pains to demonstrate. The conceptions of the minds of the sons of men,
   and their purposes as such, are as absolutely free and unconditional as
   the nature of a creature will admit; only the execution of our purposes
   and resolves is suspended upon the intervention of other things, which
   render them all conditional. And this, it seems, is the state with God
   himself, although in the Scripture he most frequently distinguisheth
   himself from the sons of men on this account, that they purpose at the
   greatest rate of uncertainty imaginable, as to the accomplishment of
   their thoughts, and therefore are frequently disappointed, but his
   purposes and his counsels stand for ever: so Ps. xxxiii. 10, 11. The
   expression then here, "I said," relates plainly to the investiture of
   Aaron and his seed in the priesthood. There was a twofold engagement
   made to the house of Aaron about that office, -- one in general to him
   and his sons, the other in particular to Phinehas and his posterity.
   The latter to Phinehas is far more expressive and significant than the
   other. You have it Numb. xxv. 11-13, "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the
   son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of
   Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed
   not the children of Israel in my jealousy. Wherefore say, Behold, I
   give unto him my covenant of peace: and he shall have it, and his seed
   after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he
   was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of
   Israel." Here is a promise indeed, and no condition in terms expressed;
   -- but yet being made and granted upon the condition of obedience,
   which is clearly expressed once and again, that the continuance of it
   was also suspended on that condition, as to the glory and beauty of
   that office, the thing principally intended, cannot be doubted; yea, it
   is sufficiently pressed in the occasion of the promise and fountain
   thereof. But this was not that promise wherein Eli's was particularly
   concerned. Indeed, his posterity was rejected in order to the
   accomplishment of this promise, the seed of Phinehas returning to their
   dignity, from whence they fell by the interposition of the house of
   Ithamar.

   That which this expression here peculiarly relates unto is the
   declaration of the mind of God concerning the priesthood of Aaron and
   his posterity, which you have Exod. xxviii. 43, xxix. 9, where the
   confirming them in their office is called "a perpetual statute," or "a
   law for ever." The signification of the term "for ever," the Hebrew
   especially, relating to legal institution, is known. Their "eternity"
   is long since expired. That, then, which God here emphatically
   expresses as an act of grace and favour to the house of Aaron, which
   Eli and his had an interest in, was that statute or law of the
   priesthood, and his purpose and intention (not concerning the event of
   things, not that it should continue in any one branch of that family,
   but) of connecting it with their obedience and faithfulness in that
   office. It is very frequent with God to express his approbation of our
   duty under terms holding out the event that would be the issue of the
   duty, though it never come to pass; and his approbation or rejection of
   the sons of men under terms that hold out the end of their
   disobedience, though it be prevented or removed. In this latter case he
   commands Jonah to cry, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
   overthrown;" not that he purposed the destruction of Nineveh at that
   time, but only effectually to hold out the end their sin, that it might
   be a means to turn them from it, and to prevent that end, which it
   would otherwise procure. His purpose was to prevent, at least prorogue,
   the ruin of Nineveh; and therefore [he] made use of threatening them
   with ruin, that they might not be ruined. To say that God purposed not
   the execution of his purpose but in such and such cases, is a plain
   contradiction. The purpose is of execution, and to say he purposed not
   the execution of his purpose, is to say plainly he purposed and
   purposed not, or he purposed not what he purposed. The examples of
   Pharaoh and Abraham, in the precepts given to them, are proofs of the
   former. But I must not insist upon particulars.

   This, then, is all that here is intended: God making a law, a statute,
   about the continuance of the priesthood in the family of Aaron, affirms
   that then he said "his house should walk before him for ever;" that is,
   with approbation and acceptation, for as to the right of the
   priesthood, that still continued in the house of Aaron, whilst it
   continued, notwithstanding the ejection of Eli and his. Now, whether
   there were any conditions in the promise made, which is Mr Goodwin's
   second improvement of this instance, may appear from the consideration
   of what hath been spoken concerning it. It is called "a law and
   statute," "the act." On that account, whatever it were that God here
   points unto is but a moral legislative act, and not a physical
   determining act of the will of God, and, being a law of privilege in
   its own nature, it involves a condition; which the acts of God's will,
   vital and eternal, wherewith this law is compared, do openly disavow.

   Let us now see the parallel between the two places insisted on for the
   explanation of the former of them; which, as it will appear by the
   sequel, is the only buckler wherewith Mr Goodwin defends his hypothesis
   from the irresistible force of the argument wherewith he hath to do:--
   First, The one speaks of things spiritual, the other of things
   temporal; secondly, The one of what God will do, and the other of what
   he approves to be done, being done; thirdly, The one holds out God's
   decree and purpose concerning events, the other his law and statute
   concerning duties; fourthly, The one not capable of interposing
   conditionals without perverting the whole design of God revealed in
   that place, the other directly including conditions; fifthly, The one
   speaking of things themselves, the other only of the manner of a thing;
   sixthly, In the one God holds out what he will do for the good of his,
   upon the account of the efficacy of his grace; in the other, what men
   are to do if they will be approved of him. And how one of these places
   can be imagined to be suited for the illustration and interpretation of
   the other, which agree neither in name nor thing, word nor deed,
   purpose nor design, must be left to the judgment of those who desire to
   ponder these things, and to weigh them in the balance of the sanctuary.

   The other instances, in the case of Saul and Paul, being more
   heterogeneous to the business in hand than that of Eli, which went
   before, require not any particular help for the removal of them out of
   the way. Though they are dead as to the end for which they are
   produced, I presume no true Israelite in the pursuit of that Sheba in
   the church, the apostasy of saints, will be retarded in his way by
   their being cast before him. In brief, neither the connection of
   obedience and suitable rewards, as in the case of Saul, nor the
   necessity of means subservient to the accomplishment of purposes
   (themselves also falling under that purpose of Him who intends the end
   and the fulfilling of it), as in the case of Paul, is of the least
   force to persuade us that the eternal, immanent acts of God's will,
   which he pursues by the effectual, irresistible acts of his grace, so
   as to compass the end which he hath from everlasting determinately
   resolved to bring about, are suspended upon imaginary conditions,
   created in the brains of men, and, notwithstanding their evident
   inconsistency with the scope of the Scripture and design of God
   therein, intruded into such texts of Scripture as on all hands (which
   will be evident in the sequel of this discourse) are fortified against
   them.

   Besides, in the case of Paul, though the infallibility of the
   prediction did not in the least prejudice the liberty of the agents who
   were to be employed for its accomplishment, but left room for the
   exhortation of Paul and the endeavours of the soldiers, yet it cuts off
   all possibility of a contrary event, and all supposal of a distinctive
   purpose in God, upon the account whereof he cannot predict the issue or
   event of any thing whatsoever. But of this more largely afterward.

   But this is farther argued by Mr Goodwin, from the purposes of God in
   his threatenings, in these words: "Most frequently the purpose and
   decree of God concerning the punishment of wicked and ungodly men is
   expressed by the Holy Ghost absolutely and certainly, without the least
   mention of any condition, or relaxation, or reversion; yet., from other
   passages of Scripture, it is fully evident that this decree of his is
   conditional in such a sense which imports a non-execution of the
   punishment therein declared upon the repentance of the persons against
   whom the decree is. In like manner, though the purpose and decree of
   God for the justification of those who are called (and so for the
   glorifying of those that shall be justified) be, in the scripture in
   hand, delivered in an absolute and unconditional form of words, yet it
   is no way necessary to suppose (the most familiar, frequent, and
   accustomed expressions in Scripture in such cases, exempting us from
   any such necessity) that therefore these decrees must needs bring forth
   against all possible interveninces whatever: so that, for example, he
   that is called by the word and Spirit must needs be justified, whether
   he truly believe or no; and he that is justified must needs be
   glorified, whether he persevere or no."

   Ans. First, That the threatenings of God are moral acts, not
   declarative, as to particular persons, of God's eternal purposes, but
   subservient to other ends, together with the law itself, whereof they
   are a portion (as the avoiding of that for which men are threatened),
   is known. They are appendices of the law, and in their relation
   thereunto declare the connection that is between sin and punishment,
   such sins and such punishments.

   Secondly, That the eternal purposes of God concerning the works of his
   grace are to be measured by the rule and analogy of his temporal
   threatenings, is an assertion striking at the very root of the covenant
   of grace, and efficacy of the mediation of the Lord Jesus, yea, at the
   very being of divine perfections of the nature of God himself. This
   there is, indeed, in all threatenings, declared of the absolute purpose
   and unchangeable decree of God, that all impenitent sinners shall be
   punished according to what in his wisdom and righteousness he hath
   apportioned out unto such deservings, and threateneth accordingly. In
   this regard there is no condition that doth or can, in the least,
   import a non-execution of the punishment decreed, neither do any of the
   texts cited in the margin of our author prove any such thing. They all,
   indeed, positively affirm [that] faithless, impenitent unbelievers
   shall be destroyed; which no supposal whatsoever that takes not away
   the subject of the question, and so alters the whole thing in debate,
   can in the least infringe. Such assertions, I say, are parts of the law
   of God revealing his will in general to punish impenitent unbelievers;
   concerning which his purpose is absolute, unalterable, and steadfast.

   The conclusion, then, which Mr Goodwin makes is apparently racked from
   the words by stretching them upon the unproportioned bed of other
   phrases and expressions, wholly heterogeneous to the design in this
   place intended. Added here are supposed conditions in general, not once
   explained, to keep them from being exposed to that shame that is due
   unto them when their intrusion, without all order or warrant from
   heaven, shall be manifested, only wrapped up in the clouds of possible
   interveniences; when the acts of God's grace, whereby his purposes and
   decrees are accomplished, do consist in the effectual removal of the
   interveniences pretended, that so the end aimed at in the unchangeable
   counsel of God may, suitably to the determination of his sovereign,
   omnipotent, infinite, wise will, be accomplished. Neither doth it in
   the least appear that any such calling by the word and Spirit as may
   leave the persons so called in their unbelief, -- they being so called
   in the pursuit of this purpose of God to give them faith and make them
   conformable to Christ, -- may be allowed place or room in the haven of
   this text. The like may be said of justification wherein men do not
   persevere. Yea, these two supposals are not only an open begging of the
   thing in contest, but a fiat defying of the apostle as to the validity
   of his demonstration, that "all things work together," etc.

   Notwithstanding, then, any thing that hath been objected to the
   contrary, the foundation of God mentioned in this place of Scripture
   stands firm, and his eternal purpose of safeguarding the saints in the
   love of Christ, until he bring them to the enjoyment of himself in
   glory, stands, clear from the least shadow of change or suspension upon
   any certain conditionals, which are confidently, but not so much as
   speciously, obtruded upon it.

   The next thing undertaken by Mr Goodwin is, to vindicate the
   forementioned glosses from such oppositions as arise against them from
   the context and words themselves, with the design of the Holy Ghost
   therein. These things doth he find his exposition obnoxious unto, --
   the exposition which he pretends to give no strength unto but what is
   foreign, on all considerations whatsoever of words and things, to the
   place itself. This, it seems, is to "prophesy according to the analogy
   of faith," Rom. xii. 6.

   First, then, sect. 44, to the objection, that those who are called are
   also justified, and shall be glorified, according to the tenor of the
   series of the acts of the grace of God here laid down, he answereth
   "That where either the one or the other of these assertions be so no,
   it must be judged of by other scriptures. Certain it is, by what hath
   been argued concerning the frequent usage of the Scripture point of
   expression, that it cannot be concluded or determined the scripture in
   hand." The sum of this answer amounts to thus much: "Although the sense
   opposed be clear in the letter and expression of this place of
   Scripture, in the grammatical sense and use of the words; though it
   flows from the whole context, and answers alone the design and scope of
   the place, which gives not the least countenance to the interposing of
   any such conditionals as are framed to force it to speak contrary to
   what, gumne te kephale, it holds forth; -- yet the mind of God in the
   words is not from these things to be concluded on; but other
   significations and senses, not of any word here used, not from the
   laying down of the same doctrine in other places, with the analogy of
   the faith thereof, not from the proposing of any design suitable to
   this here expressed, but places of Scripture agreeing with this neither
   in name nor thing, expression nor design, word nor matter, must be
   found out in the sense and meaning of this place, and from them
   concluded, and our interpretation of this place accordingly regulated."
   "Nobis non licet," etc. Neither hath Mr Goodwin produced any place of
   Scripture, nor can he, parallel to this, so much as in expression,
   though treating of any other subject or matter, that will endure to
   have any such sense tied to it as that which he violently imposeth on
   this place of the apostle. And if the sense and mind of God in this
   place may not safely be received and closed withal from the proper and
   ordinary signification of the words (which is always attended unto
   without the least dispute, unless the subject-matter of any place, with
   the context, enforces to the sense less usual and natural), with the
   clear design and scope of the context in all the parts of it,
   universally correspondent unto itself, I know not how, or when, or by
   what rules, we may have the least certainty that we have attained the
   knowledge of the mind of God in any one place of Scripture whatever.

   What he next objects to himself, namely, "That though there be no
   condition expressed in the instances by him produced, yet there are in
   parallel places, by which they are to be expounded" (but such
   conditions as these are not expressed in any place that answers to
   that, which we have in hand), it being by himself, as I conceive,
   invented to turn us aside from the consideration of the irresistible
   efficacy of the argument from this place (which use he makes of it in
   his first answer given to it), I own not; and that because I am fully
   assured, that in any promise whatsoever that is indeed conditional,
   there is no need to inquire out other scriptures of the like import to
   evince it so to be, -- all and every one of them that are such, either
   in express terms, or in the matter whereof they are, or in the legal
   manner wherein they are given and enacted, do plainly and undeniably
   hold out the conditions inquired after. His threefold answer to this
   objection needs not to detain us. Passing on, I hope, to what is more
   material and weighty, he tells us, first, sect. 44, that if this be so,
   "then it must be tried out by other scriptures, and not by this;" which
   evasion I can allow our author to insist on, as tending to shift his
   hands of this place, which, I am persuaded, in the consideration of it
   grew heavy on them. But I cannot allow it to be a plea in this contest,
   as not owning the objection which it pretends to answer. The two
   following answers being not an actual doing of any thing, but only fair
   and large promises of what Mr Goodwin will do about answering other
   scriptures, and evincing the conditionals intimated from such others as
   he shall produce (some, doubtless, will think these promises no
   payment, especially such as having weighed money formerly tendered for
   real payment have found it too light), I shall let them lie in
   expectation of their accomplishment. "Rusticus expectat, dum defluat
   amnis," etc.

   In the meantime, till answers come to hand, Mr Goodwin proffers to
   prove by two arguments (one clear answer had been more fair), that
   these acts of God, calling, justification, and so the rest, have no
   such connection between them, but that the one of them may be taken and
   be put in execution, and yet not the other, in respect of the same
   persons.

   His first reason is this: "If the apostle should frame this series or
   chain of divine acts with an intent to show or teach the
   uninterruptibleness of it, in what case or cases soever, he should
   fight against his general and main scope or design in that part of the
   chapter which lieth from verse 17, which clearly is this, to encourage
   them to constancy and perseverance in suffering afflictions: for to
   suggest any such thing as that, being called and justified, nothing
   could hinder them from being glorified, were to furnish them with a
   ground on which to neglect his exhortation; for who will be persuaded
   to suffer tribulation for the obtaining of that which they have
   sufficient assurance given that they shall obtain whether they suffer
   such things or no? Therefore, certainly, the apostle did not intend
   here to teach the certainty of perseverance in those that are
   justified."

   Ans. That this argument is of such a composition as not to operate much
   in the case in hand will easily appear; for, --

   First, These expressions, "In what case or cases soever," are foisted
   into the sense and sentence of them whom he opposes, who affirm the
   acts of God's grace here mentioned to be effectually and virtually
   preventive of those eases, and of [that] which might possibly give any
   interruption to the series of them.

   Secondly, Whatsoever is here pretended of the main scope of the
   chapter, the scope of the place we have under consideration was granted
   before to be the making good of that assertion, premised in the head
   thereof, that all things should work together for good to believers,
   and that so to make it good, that upon the demonstration of it they
   might triumph with joy and exultation; which it cannot be denied but
   that this uninterruptible series of divine acts, not framed by the
   apostle, but revealed by the Holy Ghost, is fitted and suited to do.

   Thirdly, Suppose that be the scope of the foregoing verses, what is
   there in the thesis insisted on and the sense embraced by us opposite
   thereunto? "Why, to suggest any such thing to them as that, being
   called and justified, nothing could possibly interpose to hinder them
   from being glorified, -- that is, that God by his grace will preserve
   them from departing willfully from him, and will in Jesus Christ
   establish his love to them for ever, -- was to furnish them with a
   motive to neglect his exhortations." Yea, but this kind of arguing we
   call here petitio principii, and it is accounted with us nothing valid;
   the thing in question is produced as the medium to argue by. We affirm
   there is no stronger motive possible to encourage them to perseverance
   than this proposed. "It is otherwise," saith Mr Goodwin; and its being
   otherwise in his opinion is the medium whereby he disproves not only
   that, but another truth, which he also opposeth! But he adds this
   reason, "For who would be persuaded to suffer," etc.; that is, it is
   impossible for any one industriously and carefully to use the means for
   the attainment of any end, if he hath assurance of the end by these
   means to be obtained. What need Hezekiah make use of food, or other
   means of sustaining his life, when he was assured that he should live
   fifteen years? The perseverance of the saints is not in the Scripture,
   nor by any of those whom Mr Goodwin hath chosen to oppose, held out on
   any such ridiculous terms as whether they use means or use them not,
   carry themselves well or wickedly miscarry themselves, but is asserted
   upon the account of God's effectual grace preserving them in the use of
   the means, and from all such miscarriages as should make a total
   separation between God and their souls. So that this first reason is
   but a plain begging of those things which, to use his own language, he
   would not dig for.

   But perhaps, although this first argument of Mr Goodwin be nothing but
   an importune suggestion of some hypotheses of his own, with an arguing
   from inferences not only questionable but unquestionably false, yet if
   his second demonstration will evince the matter under debate, he may be
   content to suffer loss in the hay and stubble of the first, so that the
   gold of the following argument do abide. Now, thus he proceedeth in
   these words: "And, lastly, this demonstrates the same thing yet
   farther. If God should justify all without exception whom he calleth,
   and that against all bars of wickedness and unbelief possible to be
   laid in their way by those who are called, then might ungodly and
   unbelieving persons inherit the kingdom of God. The reason of the
   connection is evident, it being a known truth that, the persons
   justified are in a condition or present capacity of inheriting the
   kingdom of God."

   Ans. But "carbones pro thesauro." If it be possible, this, being of the
   same nature with that which went before, is more weak and infirm, as
   illogical and sophistical as it. The whole strength of it lies in a
   supposal that those who are so called as here is intimated in the text,
   -- called according to the purpose of God, called to answer the desist
   of God to make them like to Jesus Christ, so called as to be hereupon
   justified, -- may yet lay such bars of wickedness and unbelief in their
   own way, when they are so called, as not to be justified, when that
   calling of theirs consists in the effectual removal of all those bars
   of wickedness and unbelief which might hinder their free and gracious
   acceptation with God; that is, that they may be called effectually and
   not effectually. A supposal hereof is the strength of that
   consideration which yielded Mr Goodwin this demonstration. His eminent
   way of arguing herein will also be farther manifest, if you shall
   consider that the very thing which he pretends to prove is that which
   he here useth for the medium to prove it, not varied in the least! "Si
   Pergama dextra,"etc. But Mr Goodwin foresaw (as it was easy for him to
   do) what would be excepted to this last argument, -- to wit, that the
   calling here mentioned effectually removes those bars of wickedness and
   unbelief, a supposal whereof is all the strength and vigour it hath;
   and in that supposal there is a plain assuming of the thing in
   question, and a bare contradiction to that which from the place we
   prove and confirm. Wherefore, he answereth sundry things:--

   First, That "Judas, Demas, Simon Magus, were all called, and yet laid
   bars of wickedness and unbelief, whereby their justification was
   obstructed." And to the reply, that they were not so called as those
   mentioned in the text, not called according to God's purpose, with that
   calling which flows from their predestination to be conformed unto
   Christ, with that calling which is held out as an effectual mean to
   accomplish the end of God in causing all things to work together for
   their good, and therefore that the strength of this answer lies in the
   interposition of his own hypothesis once more, and his renewed request
   for a grant of the thing in question, -- he proceeds to take away this
   exception by sundry cross assertions and interrogations. Sect. 45, "It
   hath not been proved," saith he, "by any man, nor I believe ever will
   be" (sir, we live not by your faith), "that the calling here spoken of
   imports any such act or work of God whereby the called are irresistibly
   necessitated savingly to believe. If it import no such thing as this,
   what hinders but that the persons mentioned might have been called by
   that very kind of calling here spoken of?"

   Ans. It is known what Mr Goodwin aims at in that expression,
   "Irresistibly necessitated savingly to believe;" we will not contend
   about words. Neither of the two first terms mentioned is either
   willingly used of us or can be properly used by any, in reference to
   the work of conversion or calling. What we own in them relates, as to
   the first term, "irresistibly," to the grace of God calling or
   converting; and in the latter, "necessitated," to the event of the call
   itself. If by "irresistibly" you intend the manner of operation of that
   effectual grace of God (not which conquers in a reaction, which
   properly may be termed so, but) which really, and therefore certainly
   (for "unumquodque, quod est, dum est, necessario est"), produces its
   effect, not by forcing the will, but, being as intimate to it as
   itself, making it willing, etc., we own it. And if by "necessitated"
   you understand only the event of things, -- that is, it is of necessity
   as to the event that they shall savingly believe who are effectually
   called, without the least straitening or necessitating their wills in
   their conversion, which are still acted suitably to their native
   liberty, -- we close with that term also, and affirm that the calling
   here mentioned imports such an act of God's grace as whereby they who
   are called are effectually and infallibly brought savingly to believe,
   and so, consequentially, that the persons whose wickedness and unbelief
   abide upon them were never called with this calling here contended
   about. They who are not predestinated a parte ante, nor glorified a
   parte post, are not partakers of this calling. I must add, that as yet
   I have not met with any proof of Mr Goodwin's interpretation, nor any
   exception against ours, that is not resolvable into the same principle
   of craving the thing in question, producing the thing to be proved as
   its own demonstration, and asserting the things proved against him not
   to be so because they are not so. From the design and scope of the
   place, the intendment of the Holy Ghost in it, the meaning of the
   words, the relation and respect wherein the acts of God mentioned stand
   one to another, the disappointment of God's purpose and decree in case
   of any interruption of them or non-producing of the effects, which lead
   the subjects of whom they are spoken from one to another, we prove the
   infallible efficacy of every act of God's grace here mentioned as to
   their tendency unto the end aimed at; and this he that is called to
   believe may infallibly do.

   "But," says Mr Goodwin, "this is otherwise." Well, let that pass. He
   adds, secondly, "Suppose it be granted that the calling here spoken of
   is that kind of calling which is always accompanied with a saving
   answer of faith, yet neither doth this prove but that even such called
   ones may obstruct and prevent, by wickedness and unbelief, their final
   justification, and consequently their glorification. If so, then that
   chain of divine acts or decrees here framed by the apostle is not
   indissolvable in any such sense which imports an infallibility, and
   universal exertion or execution of the latter whensoever the former
   hath taken place." In this answer Mr Goodwin denies our conclusion, to
   wit, that the chain of divine acts of grace in this place is
   in-dissolvable (which that it is we make out and prove from the words
   of the text, the context, and scope of the place), and adds his reason,
   "Because they who are justified may lay bars in their way from being
   finally so, or being glorified;" -- that is, it is not so, because it
   is not so; for the efficacy of the grace asserted is for the removal of
   the bars intimated, or wherein may its efficacy be supposed to consist,
   especially in its relation to the end designed? And so this place is
   answered. Saith the Holy Ghost, "Those whom God justifieth he
   glorifies." "Perhaps not," saith Mr Goodwin; "some things may fall in
   or fall out to hinder this." Eligite cui credatis.

   Were I not resolved to abstain from the consideration of the judgments
   of men when they are authoritatively interposed in the things of God, I
   could easily manifest the fruitlessness of the following endeavour to
   prove the effectual calling of Judas by the testimony of Chrysostom and
   Peter Martyr; for neither hath the first, in the place alleged, any
   such thing (least of all is it included in Mr Goodwin's marginal
   annotation, excluding compulsion, necessity, and violence, from
   vocation); and the latter, in the section pointed to and that
   following, lays down principles sufficiently destructive to the whole
   design whose management Mr Goodwin hath undertaken. Neither shall I
   contest about the imposing on us in this dispute the notion of final
   justification distinct from glorification, both name and thing being
   foreign to the Scripture, and secretly including (yea, delivering to
   the advantage of its author) the whole doctrine under consideration
   stated to his hand. If there be a gospel justification in sinners or
   believers in the blood of Christ not final or that may be cut off, he
   hath prevailed.

   But Mr Goodwin proceeds to object against himself, sect. 46, "But some,
   it may be, will farther object against the interpretation given, and
   plead, -- 1. That the contexture between these two links of this chain,
   predestination to a conformity with Christ and calling, is simply and
   absolutely indissolvable, so that whoever is so predestinated never
   fails of being called; 2. That it is altogether unlikely that, in one
   and the same series of divine actions, there should not be the same
   fixedness or certainty of coherence between all the parts." The first
   of these being the bare thesis which he opposed, I know not how it came
   to be made an objection. I shall only add to the latter objection,
   which includes something of argument, that the efficacy of any one act
   of God's grace here mentioned, as to the end proposed, depending wholly
   on the uninterruptible concatenation of them all, and the effectual
   prevalency and certainty (as to their respective operations) of every
   one of them being equal to the accomplishment of the purpose of God in
   and by them all, I willingly own it, especially finding how little is
   said, and yet how much labour taken, to dress up a pretended answer
   unto it. Of this there are two parts, whereof the first is this: "I
   answer," saith he, --

   "First, by a demur upon the former of these pleas;" which was, that the
   connection between the predestination of God mentioned and his calling
   is uninterruptible. "Somewhat doubtful to me it is whether a person
   who, by means of the love of God which is in him at present, falls
   under his decree of predestination, may not possibly, before the time
   appointed by God for his calling, be changed in that his affection, and
   consequently pass from under that decree of predestination, and fall
   under another decree of God opposite thereunto, and so never come to be
   called."

   Ans. I confess this demur outruns my understanding, equis albis, [100]
   neither can I by any means overtake it, to pin any tolerable sense upon
   it, though I would allow it to be suited only to Mr Goodwin's
   principles, and calculated for the meridian of Arminianism. For who, I
   pray, are they in any sense (in Mr Goodwin's) that do so love God as to
   fall under, as he speaks, that pendulous decree of predestination, and
   to whom this promise here is made? Are they not believers? Are any
   others predestinated, in our author's judgment, but those who are
   actually so? Is not the decree of predestination God's decree or
   purpose of saving believers by Jesus Christ? or can any love God to
   acceptation without believing? If, then, they are believers, can they
   alter that condition before they are called? We supposed that "faith
   had been by hearing, and hearing by the word of God," Rom. x. 17, and
   that it is of necessity, in order of nature, that calling should
   precede believing. What are men called to? Is it not to believe? Here,
   then, is a new sort of men discovered, that believe and fall from
   faith, love God and forsake him, all antecedently to their vocation or
   calling. I am confident that Mr Goodwin may be persuaded to withdraw
   this demurrer, or if not, that he will be overruled in it before the
   judgment-seat of all unprejudiced men. It will scarcely as yet pass
   currently that men are born believers, and after such and such a time
   of their continuance in that estate of belief, and being predestinated
   thereupon, God then calls them. Neither do I understand the meaning of
   that phrase, "Never come to be called," used by him who maintains all
   to be called; but this is but a demurrer. The answer follows.

   For the great regard I bear unto the author's abilities, I shall not
   say that his ensuing discourse doth not deserve to be transcribed and
   punctually insisted on; but this I may say, I hope, without offence,
   that it is so long and tedious, so remote from what it pretends unto,
   to wit, an answer to the forementioned argument, that I dare not
   venture upon the patience of any reader so far as to enter into a
   particular consideration of it.

   The sum of it is, "That there is no unlikelihood in this, that though
   one part of the chain of divine graces before mentioned cannot be
   dissolved or broken, yet another may (notwithstanding that a
   dissolution of any one of them renders the design of God in them all
   wholly frustrate and fruitless)." This he proves by proposing a new
   series of divine acts in actual dependence one upon another, some
   whereof may be uninterruptible, but the others not so. He that shall
   but slightly view the concatenation of divine acts here proposed by Mr
   Goodwin for the illustration of that dependence of them and their
   efficacy which we insist upon, will quickly find it liable to some such
   small exceptions as render it altogether useless as to the end
   proposed; as, --

   First, That the case here proposed, and pretended to be parallel to
   that under our consideration, is a fictitious thing, a feigned
   concatenation of feigned decrees of God, being neither in any one place
   delivered in the Scripture, nor to be collected from any or all the
   texts in the Bible; which course of proceeding, if it may be
   argumentative in sacred truth, it will be an easy and facile task to
   overthrow the most eminent and dearly-delivered heads of doctrine in
   the whole book of God.

   Secondly, That it is a case surmised by him, suitable to his own
   hypotheses, neither true in itself nor any way analogous to that
   wherewith it is yoked, being indeed a new way and tone of begging the
   thing in question. For instance, it supposeth, without the least
   attempt of proof,1. Conditional decrees, or a disjunctive intendment of
   events in God, -- it shall come to pass, or otherwise; 2. A middle
   science conditional, as the foundation of those disjunctive decrees;
   with, 3. A futurition of things, antecedent to any determining act of
   the will of God; and, 4. A possibility of frustrating, as to event, the
   designs and purposes of God; and, 5. That all mediums of the
   accomplishment of any thing are conditions of God's intentions as to
   the end he aims at; and, 6. That God appoints a series of mediums for
   the compassing of an end, and designs them thereunto, without any
   determinate resolution to bring about that end; and, 7. That the acts
   of God's grace in their concatenation, mentioned in this place of Rom.
   viii., are severally conditional, because he hath invented or feigned
   some decrees of God which he says are so; -- all which, with the
   inferences from them, Mr Goodwin knows will not advance his reasonings
   at all as to our understanding, we being fully persuaded that they are
   all abominations, of no less base alloy than the error itself in whose
   defence and patronage they are produced.

   To our argument, then, before mentioned, proving an equal
   indissolvableness in all the links of the chain of divine graces, drawn
   forth and insisted on from the equal dependence of the design and
   purpose of God on the mutual dependence of each of them on the other,
   for the fulfilling of that purpose of his, and obtaining the end which
   he professes himself to intend, this is the sum of Mr Goodwin's answer:
   "If I can invent a series of decrees and a concatenation of divine
   acts, though indeed there be no such thing, neither can I give any
   colour to it without laying down and taking for granted many false and
   absurd supposals; and though it be not of the same nature with that
   here proposed by the apostle, nor anywhere held out in the Scripture
   for any such end and purpose as this is; neither can I assign any
   absolute determinate end in this series of mine, whose accomplishment
   God engages himself to bring about (as the case stands in the place of
   Scripture under consideration), -- then it is meet and equitable that,
   laying aside all enforcements from the text, context, nature of God,
   the thing treated on, all compelling us to close with another sense and
   interpretation, we regulate the mind of the Holy Ghost herein to the
   rule, proportion, and analogy, of the case as formerly proposed." This
   being the sum of that which Mr Goodwin calls his answer, made naked, I
   presume, to its shame, "valeat quantum valere potest."

   I shall only add that, -- 1. When Mr Goodwin shall make good that order
   and series of decrees here by him mentioned from the Scripture, or with
   solid reason from the nature of the things themselves, suitably to the
   properties of Him whose they are; -- and, 2. Prove that any eternal
   decree of God, either as to its primitive enacting or temporal
   execution, is suspended on any thing not only really contingent in
   itself and its own nature, in respect of the immediate fountain from
   whence it flows and nature of its immediate cause, but also as to its
   event, in respect of any act of the will of God, that it may otherwise
   be, and so the accomplishment of that decree left thereupon uncertain,
   and God himself dubiously conjecturing at the event (for instance,
   whether Christ should die or no, or any one be saved by him); -- and,
   3. Clearly evince this notion of the decrees and purposes of God, that
   he intends to create man, and then to give him such advantages, which
   if he will it shall be so with him, if otherwise it shall be so; to
   send Christ if men do so, or not to send him if they do otherwise; and
   so of the residue of the decrees mentioned by him; -- and, 4. That all
   events of things whatsoever, spiritual and temporal, have a conditional
   futurition, antecedent to any act of the will of God: when, I say, he
   shall have proved these, and some things like to these, we shall
   farther consider what is offered by him, yea, we will confess that
   "hostis habet muros," etc.

   Of the many other testimonies to the purpose in hand, bearing witness
   to the same truth, some few may yet be singled out, and, in the next
   place, that of Jer. xxxi. 3 presents itself unto trial and examination:
   "Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
   loving-kindness have I drawn thee." It is the whole elect church of the
   seed of Jacob of whom he speaks, the foundation of whose blessedness is
   laid in the eternal love of God. Who the persons are thus beloved, and
   of whom we are to interpret these expressions of God's good-will, the
   apostle manifests, Rom. xi. 7, as shall afterward be more fully
   discoursed and cleared. He tells you it is the "election" whom God
   intends; of whom he says that they obtained the righteousness that is
   by faith, according to the purport of God's good-will towards them,
   though the rest were hardened, God (who adds daily to his church such
   as shall be saved, Acts ii. 47) drawing them thereunto upon the account
   of their being so elected. He calls them also the "remnant according to
   the election of grace," and the "people which God foreknew," verses 1,
   2, 5, or from eternity designed to the participation of the grace there
   spoken of, as the use of the word hath been evinced to be. These are
   the "thee" here designed, the portion of Israel after the flesh which
   the Lord, in his free grace, hath eternally appointed to be his
   peculiar inheritance; which in their several generations he draws to
   himself with loving-kindness. And this everlasting love is not only the
   fountain whence actual loving-kindness, in drawing to God, or bestowing
   faith, doth flow (as they believe who are ordained to eternal life,
   Acts xiii. 48), but also the sole cause and reason upon the account
   whereof, in contradistinction to the consideration of any thing in
   themselves, God will exercise loving-kindness towards them for ever.
   That which is everlasting or eternal is also unchangeable; God's
   everlasting love is no more liable to mutability than himself, and it
   is an always equal ground and motive for kindness. On what account
   should God alter in his actual kindness or favour towards any, if that
   on the account whereof he exercises it will not admit of the least
   alteration? He that shall give a condition on which this everlasting
   love of God should be suspended, and according to the influence whereof
   upon it it should go forth in kindness or be interrupted, may be
   allowed to boast of his discovery.

   That of the apostle, 2 Tim. ii. 19, is important to the business in
   hand, "Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
   seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his." Some persons of eminency and
   note in the church, yea, stars, it seems, of a considerable magnitude
   in the visible firmament thereof, having fallen away from the truth and
   faith of the gospel, and drawn many after them into ways of
   destruction, a great offence and scandal among believers thereon (as in
   such cases it will fall out) ensued; and withal a temptation of a
   not-to-be-despised prevalency and sad consequence (which we formerly
   granted to attend such eminent apostasy) seems to have laid hold on
   many weak saints. They feared lest they also might be overthrown, and,
   after all their labouring and suffering in the work of faith and
   patience of the saints, come short of "the mark of the high calling"
   set before them. Considering their own weakness and instability, with
   that powerful opposition whereunto, in those days especially, they were
   exposed, upon the contemplation of such apostasies or defections, they
   were opportune and obnoxious sufficiently to this temptation. Yea,
   their thoughts upon the case under consideration might lead them to
   fear a more general defection: for seeing it is thus with some, why may
   not this be the condition of all believers? and so the whole church may
   cease and come to nothing, notwithstanding all the promises of building
   it on a rock, and of the presence of Christ with it to the end of the
   world; nay, may not his whole kingdom on earth on this account possibly
   fall to utter ruin, and himself be left a head without members, a king
   without subjects? This, by Mr Goodwin's own confession, is the
   objection which the apostle answereth, and removes in and by the words
   under consideration: Chap. xiv. pp. 359, 360, "Seeing these fall away,
   are not we likewise in danger of falling away, and so of losing all
   that we have done and suffered in our Christian profession? To this
   objection or scruple the apostle answereth in the words in hand." So
   he. Thus far, then, are we agreed. About the sense of the words
   themselves, and their accommodation to the removal of the objection or
   scruple mentioned, is our difference. I know not how Mr Goodwin comes
   to call it "an objection or scruple" (which is the expression of
   thoughts or words arising against that which is, in the truth of it),
   seeing it is their very state and condition indeed, and that which they
   fear is that which they are really exposed unto, and which they ought
   to believe that they are exposed to. In his apprehension, they who make
   the objection, or whose scruple it was, were in his judgment as liable
   unto, and in the same danger of failing away, or greater (their
   temptation being increased and heightened by the apostasy of others)
   than they that fell the day and hour before; neither could that falling
   away of any be said to raise a scruple in them that they might do so
   too, if this were one part of their creed, that all and every man in
   the world might so do.

   The answer given by the apostle is no doubt suited to the objection,
   and fitted to the removal of the scruple mentioned; which was alone to
   be accomplished by an effectual removing away the solicitous fears and
   cares about the preservation of them in whose behalf this is produced.
   This, therefore, the apostle doth by an exception to the inference
   which they made, or through temptation might make, upon the former
   considerations. Men toi are exceptive particles, and an induction into
   the exemption of some from the condition of being in danger of falling,
   wherein they were concluded in the objection proposed. The intendment,
   I say, of the apostle, in that exceptive plea he puts in,
   "Nevertheless," is evidently to exempt some from the state of falling
   away, which might be argued against them from the defection of others.
   Neither doth he speak to the thing in hand, nor are the particulars
   mentioned exceptive to the former intimation, if his speech look any
   other way. Moreover, he gives yet farther the account of this exception
   he makes, including a radical discrimination of professors, or men
   esteemed to be believers, expressing also the principle and ground of
   that difference. The differing principle he mentioneth is, the
   foundation of God that stands sure, or the firm foundation of God that
   is established or stands firm; this is not worth contending about; --
   an expression parallel to that of the same apostle, Rom. ix. 11, "That
   the purpose of God according to election might stand." Both this and
   that hold out some eternal act of God, differencing between persons as
   to their everlasting condition. As if the apostle had said, "Ye see,
   indeed, that Hymeneus and Philetus are fallen away, and that others
   with whom you sometimes walked in the communion and outward fellowship
   of the gospel, and took sweet counsel together in the house of God with
   them, are gone after them; yet be you, true believers, of good comfort:
   God hash laid a foundation" (which must be some eternal act of his
   concerning them of whom he is about to speak, or [else] the solemn
   assertion of the apostle, than which you shall not easily meet with one
   more weighty, is neither to the case nor matter in hand) "which is firm
   and abiding, being the good pleasure of his will, accompanied with an
   act of his wisdom and understanding, appointing some (as is the case of
   all true believers) to be his, who shall be exempted on that account
   from the apostasy and desertion that you fear. This," saith the
   apostle, "is the fountain and spring of the difference which is among
   them that profess the gospel. Concerning some of them is the purpose of
   God for their preservation: they are ordained to eternal life.'?" And
   herein, as was said, lies the concernment of all that are true
   believers, who are all his, chosen of him, given to his Son, and called
   according to his purpose. With others it is not so; they are not built
   on that bottom, they have no such foundation of their profession, and
   it is not therefore marvellous if they fall.

   The words, then, contain an exception of true believers from the danger
   of total apostasy, upon the account of the stable, fixed, eternal
   purpose of God concerning their salvation, answerable to that of Rom.
   viii. 28-30, the place Last considered. The "foundation" here mentioned
   is the good pleasure of the will of God, which he had purposed in
   himself, or determined to exert towards them, for the praise of the
   glory of his grace, Eph. i. 9; according to which purpose we are
   predestinated, verse 11. And he calls this purpose the "foundation of
   God," as being a groundwork and bottom of the thing whereof the apostle
   is treating, -- namely, the preservation and perseverance of true
   believers, those who are indeed planted into Christ, notwithstanding
   the apostasy of the most glorious professors, who, being not within the
   compass of that purpose, nor built on that foundation, never attain
   that peculiar grace which by Jesus Christ is to them administered who
   have that privilege. And this farther appears by the confirmation of
   the certainty of this foundation of God which he hath laid, manifested
   in the next words, "It hath this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are
   his." Whether ye will take this either for a demonstration of the
   former assertion, a posteriori, from the peculiar love, favour,
   tenderness, and care, which the Lord bears to them which are his, who
   are built on the foundation mentioned, whereby, in the pursuit of his
   eternal purpose, he will certainly preserve them from perishing,
   knowing, owning, and taking care of them in every condition; or for the
   prescience of God, accomplishing his eternal purpose, designing them of
   whom he speaks as his (for his they were, and he gave them unto
   Christ), -- is to me indifferent. Evident it is that this confirmation
   of the purpose mentioned is added to assure us of the stability and
   accomplishment of it, in that none who are built thereon or concerned
   therein shall fall away. And herein doth the apostle fully answer and
   remove the forementioned objection. "Let men," saith he, "appear never
   so eminent in profession, if once they prove apostates, they manifest
   themselves to have been but hypocrites; that is, such as never had any
   of the faith of God's elect, which is their peculiar who are ordained
   to eternal life."

   This, then, beyond all colourable exception, is the intendment of the
   apostle in the words under consideration: "Though many professors fall
   away, yet you that are true believers be not shaken in your confidence;
   for God hath laid the foundation of your preservation in his eternal
   purpose, whereby you are designed to life and salvation, and by the
   fruits whereof you are discriminated from the best of them that fall
   away. Only continue in the use of means; let every one of you depart
   from iniquity, and keep up to that universal holiness whereunto also ye
   are appointed and chosen." And this is the whole of what we desire
   demonstration of, neither will less in any measure answer the objection
   or remove the scruple at first proposed.

   But, it seems, we are all this while beside the intendment of the
   apostle, whose resolution of the objection mentioned is quite of
   another nature than what we have hitherto insisted on, which Mr Goodwin
   thus represents, page 359, chap. xiv. sect. 14:--

   "To this objection or scruple the apostle, in the words now in hand,
   answereth to this effect, that notwithstanding the falling away of men,
   whoever or how many soever they be, yet the glorious gospel and truth
   of God therein stands, and always hath stood, firm and steadfast: which
   gospel hath the matter and substance of this saying in it, as a seal
   for the establishment of those who are upright in the sight of God,
   namely, The Lord knoweth,' that is, takes special notice of, approveth,
   and delighteth in, those that are his,' -- that is, who truly believe
   in him, love and serve him; yea, and farther hath this item, tending to
   the same end, Let every one that calleth upon the name of Christ,' that
   is, makes profession of his name, depart from iniquity.' So that in
   this answer to the scruple mentioned the apostle intimateth, by way of
   satisfaction, that the reason why men fall away from the faith is
   partly because they do not consider what worthy respects God beareth to
   those who cleave to him in faith and love, partly also because they
   degenerate into loose and sinful courses, contrary to the law imposed
   by the gospel; and consequently, that there is no such danger of their
   falling away who shall duly consider the one and observe the other. In
   asserting the stability of the truth of God in the gospel, by the way
   of antidote against the fears of those that might possibly suspect it,
   because of the defections of others from it, he doth but tread in his
   own footsteps elsewhere in this very chapter, If we believe not, yet he
   abideth faithful, and cannot deny himself.'?"

   Ans. If that necessity were not voluntarily chosen which enforceth men
   to wrest and pervert the word of God, not only to mistaken, but
   strange, uncouth, and inconsistent senses, their so doing might perhaps
   seem not to be altogether without colourer and pretext; but when they
   willingly embrace those paths which will undoubtedly lead them into the
   briers, and, contrary to abundance of light and evidence of truth,
   embrace those persuasions which necessitate them to such courses, I
   know not what cloak they have left for their deviations. An example of
   this we have before us in the words recited. A sense is violently
   pinned upon the apostle's words, not only alien, foreign, to the scope
   of the place and genuine signification of the words themselves, but
   wholly unsuited for any serviceableness to the end for which the author
   of this gloss himself confesseth these expressions of the apostle to be
   produced and used.

   The sum of Mr Goodwin's exposition of this place is this: The
   "foundation of God" is the gospel or the doctrine of it; its
   "standing," or "standing sure," the certain truth of the gospel; the
   "seal" mentioned is the substance or matter of that saving, "God knows
   who are his," contained in the gospel; and the answer to the objection
   or scruple lies in this, that the reason why men fall from the gospel
   (which neither is nor was the scruple, nor was it so proposed by Mr
   Goodwin) is because they consider not the love that God bears to
   believers, -- that is, that he approves them whilst they are such,
   which is indeed one main part of the gospel; so that men fall from the
   gospel because they fall from the gospel, and this must satisfy the
   scruple proposed. It is an easy thing for men of ability and eloquence
   to gild over the most absurd and inconsistent interpretation of
   Scripture with some appearance of significancy; though I must needs say
   I know not rightly when nor by whom, pretending to any sobriety, it
   hath been more unhappily or unsuccessfully tempted than by Mr Goodwin
   in this place, as upon due consideration will be made farther appear.
   For, --

   1. To grant that "the foundation of God" may be said so far to be the
   gospel, because his eternal purpose, so expressed, is therein revealed,
   which is the interpretation Mr Goodwin proposeth, I ask, -- Whether the
   apostle applies himself to remove the scruple ingenerated in the minds
   of believers about their own falling away, upon consideration of the
   apostasy of others, and to answer the objection arising thereupon? This
   Mr Goodwin grants in the head, though in the branches of his discourse
   he casts in inquiries quite of another nature, -- as, that a reason is
   inquired after why men fall from the gospel, and a suspicion is
   supposed to arise of the truth of the gospel because some fell from it;
   things that have not the least intimation in the words or context of
   the place, nor are of any such evidence for their interest in the
   business in hand that Mr Goodwin durst take them for ingredients in the
   case under consideration when he himself proposed it: so that he was
   enforced to foist in this counterfeit case to give some colour to the
   interpretation of the words introduced. But yet this must not be openly
   owned, but intermixed with other discourses, to lead aside the
   understanding of the reader from bearing in mind the true state of the
   case by the apostle proposed and by himself acknowledged. So that this
   discourse "desinit in piscem," etc.

   2. The case being supposed as above, I ask whether the apostle intended
   a removal of the scruple and answer to the objection, as far, at least,
   as the one was capable of being removed and the other of being
   answered? This, I suppose, will not be scrupled or objected against,
   being indeed fully granted in stating the occasion of the words; for we
   must at least allow the Holy Ghost to speak pertinently to what he doth
   propose. Then, --

   3. I farther inquire, whether any thing whatever be in the least suited
   to the removal of the scruple and objection proposed, but only the
   giving of the scruplers and objectors the best assurance that upon
   solid grounds and foundations could be given, or they were in truth
   capable of, that what they feared should not come upon them, and that,
   notwithstanding the deviation of others, themselves should be
   preserved? And then, --

   4. Seeing that the sum of the sense of the words given by Mr Goodwin
   amounts to these two assertions, -- 1. "That the doctrine of the gospel
   is true and permanent;" 2. "That God approves for the present all who
   for the present believe;" supposing that there is nothing in the gospel
   teaching the perseverance of the saints, I ask yet whether there be any
   thing in this answer of the apostle, so interpreted, able to give the
   least satisfaction imaginable to the consciences and hearts of men
   making the objection mentioned? for is it not evident, notwithstanding
   any thing here expressed, that they and every believer in the world may
   apostatize and fall away into hell? Say the poor believers, "Such and
   such fell away from the faith; their eminent usefulness in their
   profession, beyond perhaps what we are able to demonstrate of
   ourselves, makes us fear that this abominable defection may go on and
   swallow us up, and grow upon the church to a farther desolation." The
   answer is: "However, the gospel is true, and God bears gracious
   respects to them that cleave to him in love, whilst they do so."
   "Quæstio est de alliis, responsio de cepis." Methinks the apostle might
   have put them upon those considerations which Mr Goodwin proposes, as
   of excellent use and prevalency against falling away, that they put men
   out of danger of it (chap. ix.), rather than have given them an answer
   not in the least tending to their satisfaction, nor any way suited to
   their fears or inquiries, no, not [even] as backed with that
   explanation, that "they fall away because they degenerate into loose
   and sinful courses;" that is, because they fall away. A degeneracy into
   loose and sinful courses amounts surely to no less.

   5. Again, I would know whether this "foundation of God" be an act of
   his will commanding or purposing, -- declarative of our duty or his
   intention? If the first, then [I would know] what occasion is
   administered to make mention of it in this place? -- whether it were
   called in question or no? and whether the assertion of it conduces to
   the solution of the objection proposed? Or is it in any parallel terms
   expressed in any other place? Besides, seeing this "foundation of God"
   is in nature antecedent to the "sealing" mentioned, or God's "knowing
   them that are his," and the object of the act of God's will, be it what
   it will, being the persons concerning whom that sealing is, [I would
   know] whether it can be any thing but some distinguishing purpose of
   God concerning those persons in reference to the things spoken of?
   Evident, then, it is, from the words themselves, the occasion of them,
   the design and scope of the apostle in the place, that the "foundation
   of God" here mentioned is his discriminating purpose concerning some
   men's certain preservation unto salvation; which is manifestly
   confirmed by that seal of his, that he "knoweth them" in a peculiar,
   distinguishing manner; -- a manner of speech and expression suited
   directly to what the same apostle useth in the same case everywhere, as
   Rom. viii. 28-30, 9, xi. 1, 2; Eph. i. 4-6.

   "But," saith Mr Goodwin, "this is no more than what the apostle
   elsewhere speaks: Rom. iii. 3, What if some did not believe? shall
   their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?' -- that is, Shall
   the unbelief of men be interpreted as any tolerable argument or ground
   to prove that God is unfaithful, or that he hath no other faith in him
   than that which sometimes miscarrieth, and produceth not that for which
   it stands engaged?' implying that such an interpretation as this is
   unreasonable in the highest."

   But truly, by the way, if it be so, I know not who in the lowest can
   quit Mr Goodwin from unreasonableness in the highest; for doth he not
   contend in this whole discourse, that the faith of God in his promises,
   for the producing of that for which it stands engaged (as when he saith
   to believers he will "never leave them nor forsake them"), doth so
   depend on the faith of men as to the event intended, that it is very
   frequently by their unbelief rendered of none effect? Is not this the
   spirit that animates the whole religion of the apostasy of saints? Is
   not the great contest between us, whether any unbelief of men may
   interpose to render the faith of God of none effect as to the producing
   of the thing he promiseth? "Tibi, quia intrîsti, exedendum est."

   But, 2. Let it be granted that these two places of the apostle are of a
   parallel signification, what will it advantage the interpretation
   imposed on us? What is the "faith of God" here intended? and what the
   "unbelief" mentioned? and whereunto tends the apostle's vehement
   interrogation? The great contest in this epistle concerning the Jews
   (of whom he peculiarly speaks, verses 1, 2) was about the promise of
   God made to them, and his faithfulness therein. Evident it was that
   many of them did not believe the gospel; as evident that the promise of
   God was made peculiarly to them, to Abraham and his seed. Hence no
   small perplexity arose about the reconciliation of these things, many
   perplexed thoughts ensuing on this seeming contradiction. If the gospel
   be indeed the way of God, what is become of his faithfulness in his
   promises to Abraham and his seed, they rejecting it? If the promises be
   true and stable, what shall we say to the doctrine of the gospel, which
   they generally disbelieve and reject? In this place the apostle only
   rejects the inference that the faithfulness of God must fall and be of
   none effect because the Jews believed not; whereof he gives a full
   account afterward, when he expressly takes up the objection and handles
   it at large, chap. ix.-xi. The sum of the answer he there gives as a
   defensative of the faithfulness of God, with a non obstante to the
   infidelity of some of the Jews, amounts to no more or less than what is
   here argued and by us asserted, namely, that notwithstanding this
   (their incredulity and rejection of the gospel), "the foundation of God
   standeth sure, The Lord knoweth them that are his;" -- that the
   promise, his faithfulness wherein came under debate, was not made to
   all the Jews, but to them that were chosen according to his purpose, as
   he expressly disputes it at large beyond all possibility of
   contradiction, chap. xi., as shall afterward be further argued, and
   hath in part been already discovered. I verily believe never did any
   man produce a testimony more to the disadvantage of his own cause, both
   in general and in particular, than this is to the cause Mr Goodwin hath
   in hand.

   Neither doth he advance one step farther in the confirmation of the
   sense imposed on the apostle's words, by comparing them with the words
   of the same apostle, verse 13 of the same chapter, "If we believe not,
   yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny himself;" wherein again,
   contrary to the whole drift of Mr Goodwin's discourse, the faithfulness
   of God in the accomplishment of his promises is asserted to be wholly
   independent upon any qualification whatever in them to whom those
   promises are made: "Though we are under sufferings, temptations, and
   trials, very apt to be cast down from our hope of the great things that
   God hath prepared for us and promised to us, yet his purpose shall
   stand however, and our unbelief shall not in the least cause him to
   withdraw, or not to go through with his engagement to the utmost. The
   faithfulness of his own nature requireth it at his hand; he cannot deny
   himself.'?"

   What remains, sect. 14, wherein he labours farther to give strength
   unto, or rather more largely to explicate, what he formerly asserted,
   is built upon a critical consideration of the word themelios, which,
   without any one example produced from any approved author, we must
   believe to signify a "bond," or "instrument of security given between
   men by the way of contract." And what, then, suppose it do? "Why, then,
   contrary to the whole scope of the place, and constant signification of
   the word in the Scripture, it must be interpreted according to the
   analogy of that sense." Why so? doth it remove any difficulty on the
   other hand? doth it more suit the objection for its removal, whereunto
   it is given, that we should warp from the first, genuine, native, usual
   signification of the word, to that which is exotic and metaphorical?
   "Yea, but we are enforced to embrace this sense, because that here is a
   seal set to this foundation, and men use not to set seals to the
   foundation of a house.'?" And is it required that allusions should hold
   in all particulars and circumstances, even in such as wherein their
   teaching property doth not consist? The terms of "foundation" and
   "sealing" are both figurative; neither will either of them absolutely
   be squared to those things in nature wherein they have their
   foundation. The purpose of God is here called his "foundation," because
   of its stability, abidingness, strength, and use in bearing up the
   whole fabric of the salvation of believers, not in respect of its lying
   in or under the ground, or being made of wood or stone. And in this
   sense, why may it not be said to be sealed? Spiritual sealing holds out
   two things, -- confirmation, and conforming by impression; and in them
   consists the chief political use of the word and thing, not in being a
   label annexed to a writing. And why may not a purpose be confirmed, or
   be manifested to be firm, as well as a contract or instrument in law,
   having also its conforming virtue and efficacy (which is the natural
   effect of sealing, to implant the image in the seal on the things
   impressed with it), in rendering them, concerning whom the purpose of
   God is, answerable to the image of his Son, in whom the purpose is
   made, and that pattern which he hath chosen them to and appointed them
   for? What followeth to the end of this section is but a new expression
   of what Mr Goodwin pretends to be the sense of this place. The
   "foundation of God" is the gospel, or the promise of God to save
   believers; the "seal" is his taking notice of them to save them, and to
   condemn them that believe not; and therefore, questionless, believers
   need not fear that they shall fall away, though there be not the least
   intimation made of any thing that should give them the least
   comfortable or cheering security of preservation in believing. Only it
   is said, "He that believeth shall be saved" (which yet is not an
   absolute promise of salvation to believers), "and he that believeth not
   shall be damned;" which one disjunctive proposition, declarative of the
   connection that is between the means and the end, Mr Goodwin labours to
   make comprehensive of all the purposes of God concerning believers, it
   being such as wherein no one person in the world is more concerned than
   another. If the "foundation" here mentioned be only God's purpose, or
   rather declaration of his will, for the saving of believers and the
   damning of unbelievers, what consolation could be from hence
   administered in particular unto persons labouring under the scruple
   mentioned formerly hath not as yet been declared. Let us, then, proceed
   to farther proof of the truth in hand, and the vindication of some
   other places of Scripture whereby it is confirmed.

   That which I shall next fix upon is that eminent place of John, chap.
   vi. 37-40: "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him
   that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from
   heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And
   this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath
   given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the
   last day, And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one
   which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life:
   and I will raise him up at the last day." Our Saviour acquaints us with
   the design wherewith he came from heaven: it was "not to do his own
   will," -- that is, to accomplish or bring about any private purposes of
   his own, distinct or different from them of his Father, as he was
   blasphemously charged by the Jews to do, -- but he came to do the will
   of God, "the will of him that sent him." The "will of God" which Christ
   came to fulfil is sometimes taken for the "commandment which he
   received from the Father" for the accomplishment of his will. So Heb.
   x. 9, "I come to do thy will, O God," -- that is, to fulfil thy
   command; as it is expressed, Ps. xl. 8, "Thy law is within my heart."
   "Thy law, all that thou requirest at my hand as mediator, I am ready to
   perform." On this account is Christ said to "take on him the form of a
   servant," Phil. ii. 7, -- that is, to become so indeed, in the
   assumption of human nature, that he might do the will of him that sent
   him. For which reason, also, his Father expressly calls him his
   servant: Isa. xlii. 1, "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect,
   in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him: he shall
   bring forth judgment to the Gentiles." He is the servant of the Father
   in the accomplishment of that work for which the Spirit was put upon
   him. And verse 19, "Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my
   messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as
   the Lord's servant." God gives him in command to fulfil his will, which
   accordingly he performs to the utmost. Again; the "will of God" is
   taken for his purpose, his design, decree, and good pleasure, for the
   fulfilling and accomplishment whereof the Lord Christ came into the
   world. And this appears to be the sense and importance of the words in
   this place, from the distinction which is put between the will of the
   Father and any such private will of Christ as the Jews thought he went
   about to establish, [namely, that] it was some design of his own. In
   opposition whereunto he tells them that he came to do the will, -- that
   is, to fulfil the counsel, purpose, and design, -- of the Father.
   However, should it principally be taken for the command of God, yet
   there is, and must needs be, a universal coincidence and oneness in the
   object of God's purposing and commanding will in all commands given
   unto Christ; because all of them shall certainly and infallibly by him
   be fulfilled, and so the thing certainly accomplished which is
   commanded. What now is the will, purpose, aim, design, and command, of
   the Father, whose execution and accomplishment is committed to the Lord
   Christ, and which he faithfully undertakes to perform, as he was
   faithful in all things to Him that appointed him? For the clearing of
   this, let these two things be observed:-- 1. Who the persons are
   concerning whom this will of God is. And those he describes by a double
   character:-- (1.) From their election, the Father's giving them to him:
   "All which he hath given me," John vi. 39; that is, all his elect, as
   our Saviour expounds this very expression, chap. xvii. 6, "Thine they
   were, and thou gavest them me;" -- "Thine they were in eternal
   designation, thou having chosen them before the foundation of the
   world,' and thou gavest them to me for actual redemption, to deliver
   them from every thing that keeps them at a distance from thee." (2.)
   From their faith or believing, which he calls "seeing the Son, and
   believing on him," chap. vi. 40. The persons, then, here designed are
   elect believers, persons chosen and called of God. 2. What next, then,
   is the will of God concerning them? This also is set out both in
   general and in some particulars:-- (1.) In general, That none of them
   be lost; that by no means whatsoever, by no temptations of Satan,
   deceits of sin, fury of oppressors, weakness or decay of faith, they
   perish and fall away from him, verse 39. This is the will, the design
   and purpose of God; this he gives to Jesus Christ in command for to
   accomplish. (2.) In particular, That they might have everlasting life,
   verse 40; that they be preserved to the enjoyment of that glory
   whereunto they are designed; that they may be raised up at the last
   day, and so never be lost, neither as to their being nor well-being. Of
   these two, verse 40, everlasting life is placed before the resurrection
   or raising of believers at the last day; plainly intimating that the
   spiritual life, whereof in this world we are partakers, is also, as to
   its certain, uninterruptible continuance, an everlasting life, that
   shall never be intercepted or cut off That, then, which from this
   portion of Scripture I argue is this: God having purposed to give
   eternal life to his elect believers, and that none of them should ever
   be lost, and having committed the accomplishing and performance of this
   his good-will and pleasure unto the Lord Jesus, who was faithful unto
   him in all things, and endued with power (all power from above) for
   that end, they shall certainly be preserved to the end designed. The
   favour and love of God in Christ shall never be turned away from them;
   for his "counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure."

   Something is by Mr Goodwin offered to take off the strength of this
   testimony, but yet so little, that had I not resolved to hear him out
   to the utmost of what he can say in and unto the case in hand, it would
   scarce be thought needful to divert to the consideration of it. This
   place of Scripture he binds up in one bundle with nine or ten others,
   to the composure of one argument, which (almost uno halitu) he blows
   away, chap. xi. sect. 36, 37, etc., pp. 251, 252, etc. To the
   consideration of the argument itself there by him proposed I am not yet
   arrived. The influence of this text into it is from what is said of
   Christ's preserving believers; my present consideration is chiefly of
   the will and intention of the Father's giving them to him to be
   preserved; so that I shall observe only one or two things to his
   general answer, and then proceed to the vindication of this particular
   place we have in hand:--

   First, He tells you, "That the conclusion of the former argument, that
   true believers shall never miscarry or fall away, opposeth not his
   sense in this controversy." Whether it oppose his sense or no must be
   judged. This I know, that he hath to his utmost opposed it all this
   while, showing himself therein very uncourteous and unkind. But why so?
   on what account is it that this conclusion, which he hath so much
   opposed, is now conceited not to oppose him? "Those who thus fall
   away," saith he, "are no true believers, but wicked apostates, at the
   time of their falling away." That the conclusion mentioned opposeth his
   sense to me is evident; but that it is sense wherewith in this place he
   opposeth the conclusion is not so clear. The question is, Who fall
   away? "Not believers, but apostates," saith Mr Goodwin. We say so too.
   In the natural first sense of these words, [they] who eventualiter are
   apostates were never antecedenter to their apostasy true believers. But
   this is not your sense, doubtless. That those who fall away, in their
   falling away (which is the sense of that clause, "At the time of
   falling away"), were apostates, -- that is, were fallen away before
   they fell away, -- is neither our sense nor yours, for it is none at
   all. Bertius hath an argument against the perseverance of the saints,
   from the impossibility of finding a subject to be affected with the
   notion of apostasy if true believers be exempted from it; "for
   hypocrites," saith he, "cannot fall away." "Nor can believers," saith
   Mr Goodwin, "but they are apostates when they fall away!" -- that is,
   it is a dead man that dies, or after he is dead he dies; after he is an
   apostate, he falls away. Perhaps it would be worth our serious inquiry
   to consider how believers can indeed possibly come to lose the Spirit
   of grace which dwells in them, with their habit of faith and holiness.
   For our part, we contend that they have an infused habit of grace, and
   that wrought with a mighty impression upon their minds and hearts;
   faith being of the operation of God, wrought by the exceeding greatness
   of his power, as he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead.
   Whether such a habit can be removed but by that hand that bestowed it,
   and whether it may be made appear that God will on any occasion so take
   it away, or hath expressed himself that he will so deal with any of his
   children, is, I say, worthy our inquiry. But, --

   Secondly, He denies the major proposition, and saith, "That those who
   are kept and preserved by Christ may possibly miscarry." Boldly
   ventured! What want is there, then, or defect in the Keeper of Israel,
   that his flock should so miscarry under his hand? Is it of
   faithfulness? The Scripture tells us he is "a faithful high priest in
   things pertaining to God," Heb. ii. 17; "faithful to him that appointed
   him," chap. iii. 2; and that he did the whole will of God. Is it of
   tenderness, to take care of his poor wandering ones? He is otherwise
   represented unto us: Heb. ii. 18, "For in that he himself hath suffered
   being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted;" and chap.
   iv. 15, "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
   feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we
   are, yet without sin." Isa. xl. 11, it is said of him, "He shall feed
   his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and
   carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with
   young." And he quarrels with those shepherds who manifest not a care
   and tenderness like his towards his flock: Ezek. xxxiv. 4, "The
   diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which
   was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have
   ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought
   that which was lost;" all which he takes upon himself to perform,
   verses 15, 16. Or is it want of power? "All power is given unto him in
   heaven and in earth," Matt. xxviii. 18. "All things are delivered unto
   him of his Father," Matt. xi. 27. "He is able to save them to the
   uttermost that come unto God by him," Heb. vii. 25. If he want neither
   care nor tenderness, wisdom nor watchfulness, love nor ability, will
   nor faithfulness, how comes it to pass that they miscarry and fall away
   into ruin whom he hath undertaken to keep? David durst fight with a
   lion and a bear in the defence of his lambs, and Jacob endured heat and
   cold upon the account of faithfulness; and shall we think that the
   Shepherd of Israel, from whose being so the psalmist concludes he shall
   want nothing, Ps. xxiii. 1, who did not only fight for his flock, but
   laid down his life for them, will be less careful of his Father's
   sheep, his own sheep, which are required also at his hand, for his
   Father knows them and calls them all by name?

   "Yea, but," says Mr Goodwin, "it may be thus, in case themselves shall
   not comport with Christ in his act of preserving them, with their care
   and diligence in preserving themselves;" that is, Christ will surely
   keep them in case they keep themselves. Alas! poor sheep of God! If
   this were the case of the flocks of the sons of men, how quickly would
   they be utterly destroyed! Doth the veriest hireling in the world deal
   thus with his sheep, -- keep them in case they keep themselves? Nay, to
   what end is his keeping if they keep themselves? Christ compares
   himself to be the good shepherd which seeketh out and fetcheth a
   wandering sheep from the wilderness, laying it on his shoulders, and
   bringing it home to his fold. How did that poor sheep keep itself, when
   it ran among the ravenous wolves in the wilderness? Yet by the good
   shepherd it was preserved. This is the spirit and comforting genius of
   this doctrine: "Christ keeps us provided we keep ourselves!" "We
   trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel;" that he
   gave us his Holy Spirit to abide with us for ever, to seal us to the
   day of redemption; that knowing himself, and telling us, that without
   him we can do nothing, he would not suspend his doing upon our doing so
   great a thing as preserving ourselves. For let us see now what it is
   that is required in us if we shall be preserved by Christ: it is to
   comport with him in his act of preserving us, and to be diligent to
   keep ourselves.

   What is this "comporting with him in his act of preserving us?" Our
   comporting with Christ in any thing is by our believing in him and on
   him; that is our radical comportment, whence all other closings of
   heart in obedience do flow. So, then, Christ will preserve us in
   believing, provided we continue to believe. But what need of his help
   to do so, if antecedently thereunto so we do? Is not this not only
   agraphon but also alogon, not only unscriptural, but also unreasonable,
   yea, absurd and ludicrous? This is the flinty fountain of all that
   abundance of consolation which Mr Goodwin's doctrine doth afford.
   Doubtless, they must be wise and learned men (like himself) who can
   extract any such thing therefrom. Let him go with it to a poor, weak,
   tempted, fainting believer, and try what a comforter he will be
   thought, a physician of what value he will be esteemed. Let him tell
   him, "Thou art indeed weak in faith, ready to decay and perish, which
   thou mayst do every day, there being neither purpose nor promise of God
   to the contrary; great oppositions and great temptations hast thou to
   wrestle withal. But yet Christ is loving, tender, faithful, and in case
   thou continuest believing, he will take care thou shalt believe. That
   Christ will increase thy faith, and keep it alive by continual
   influences, as from a head into its members, preserving thee not only
   against outward enemies, but the treacheries, and deceits, and unbelief
   of thine own heart, of any such thing I can give thee no account." Such
   consolation a poor man may have at home at any time.

   Farther; what is that act of Christ in preserving them that is to be
   comported withal? wherein doth it consist? Is it not in his daily,
   continual communication to them of new supplies of that spiritual life
   whose springs are in him; the making out from his own fullness unto
   them; his performing the office of a head to its members, and filling
   those other relations wherein he stands, working in them both to will
   and to do of his own good pleasure? [101] What is it, then, to comport
   with this act or these acts of Christ? Can any thing reasonable be
   invented wherein such comportment may be thought to consist, but either
   it will be found coincident with that whereof it is a condition, or
   appear to be such as will crush the whole undertaking of Christ for the
   preservation of believers into vanity and nothing? Again; hath Christ
   undertaken to preserve us against all our enemies, or some only? [102]
   If some only, give us an account both of them that he doth undertake
   against, that we may know for what to go to him and whereof to
   complain, and of them that he doth not so undertake to safeguard us
   against, that we may know wherein to trust to ourselves; [103] and let
   us see the places of Scripture wherein any enemies are excepted out of
   this undertaking of Christ for the safety of his. Paul goes far in an
   enumeration of particulars, Rom. viii. 35-39. If he hath undertaken
   against them all, then let us know whether it be an enemy that keeps us
   from this comportment with Christ, or a friend. If it be an enemy (as
   surely every thing in us that moves us to depart from the living God
   is), hath Christ undertaken against it, or no? If not, how hath he
   undertaken against them all? If he hath, how is it that it prevails?
   "Yea, but he undertakes this in case we comport with him;" that is, he
   undertakes to overcome such an enemy in case there be no such enemy. In
   case we be not turned aside from comporting with him, he will destroy
   that enemy that turns us aside from comporting with him. "Egregiam veró
   laudem et spolia ampla!" Or, on the other side, if our enemies prevail
   not against us, he hath faithfully undertaken that they shall not
   prevail against us.

   "Yea, but," saith Mr Goodwin, "no Scripture proves that those whom
   Christ preserves must, by any compulsory, necessitating power, use
   their diligence in preserving themselves." And who, I pray, ever said
   they did? Compulsory actings of grace are your own figment; so are all
   such necessitating acts which proceed any farther than only as to the
   infallibility of the event aimed at. God doth not compel the wills of
   men when he works in them to will. [104] Christ doth not compel men to
   care and diligence when he works in them holy care and diligence. When
   the disciples said unto the Lord, "Increase our faith," they did not
   pray that they might be compelled to believe. God's working in them
   that believe according to the exceeding greatness of his power,
   "strengthening them with all might, according to his glorious power,
   unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness," [105] is very
   far from any compulsion or necessitation inconsistent with the most
   absolute freedom that a creature is capable of. He that works faith in
   believers can continue it and increase it in them without compulsion.
   [106] And this is the sum of Mr Goodwin's answer to an argument that,
   notwithstanding all which he hath spoken, hath yet strength enough left
   to cast his whole building down to the ground. What he farther speaks
   to the particular place which gave occasion to this discourse may
   briefly be considered:--

   He speaks something to John vi. 37, which I insisted not on. As to the
   purpose in hand, he tells you that "Christ will in no wise cast out ton
   erchomenon, him that is coming;' but yet he that is coming, in his way
   may turn back and never come fully up to him."

   Ans. But if this be not huckstering of the word of God, I know not what
   is. [107] The words before in the same verse are, "All that the Father
   giveth me shall come to me." Saith Mr Goodwin, "They may come but half
   way, and so turn back again, not coming fully home to him." Saith
   Christ, "They shall come to me." Saith Mr Goodwin, "They may perhaps
   come but half way." "Nunc satis est dixisse, ego mira poemata pango."
   But why so? Why, erchomenon is "coming," -- a coming, it seems, in
   fieri, but not in facto esse; that is, it denotes a tract of time
   whilst the man is travelling his journey, as though believing were a
   successive motion as to the act of laying hold on Christ. But is he
   that is on his way, that Christ receiveth, a believer or not? hath he
   faith or not? If he hath no faith, the faith whereof we speak, how can
   he be said to be "coming," seeing the "wrath of God abideth on him?"
   John iii. 36. If he hath faith, how is it that he is not come to
   Christ? Hath any one true faith at a distance from him? God gives
   another testimony, John i. 11, 12. But saith he, "There is nothing in
   the words that they are under no possibility of falling away who come
   to Christ." But, -- 1. There is in those that follow, that, as to the
   event, they are under an impossibility of so doing, in respect of the
   will and purpose of God (which sufficeth me), as shall be made to
   appear. 2. That emphatical expression, Ou me ekbalo exo, "I will in no
   wise cast them out," expresses so much care and tenderness in Christ
   towards them, that we are very apt to hope and believe that he will not
   lose them any more, but that he will not only not cast them out, but
   also, according to his Father's appointment, that he will keep them,
   and preserve them in safety, until he bring them to glory; as is fully
   asserted, John vi. 39, 40, as hath been declared.

   Again, Mr Goodwin tells you, "It is not spoken of losing believers by
   defection of faith, but by death; and to assure believers of this,
   Christ tells them it is his Father's will that he should raise them up
   at the last day. Besides, if any be lost by defection from faith, this
   cannot be imputed to Christ, who did his Father's pleasure to the
   utmost for their preservation, but to themselves."

   Ans. For the perverting of verse 37, the beginning of it was left out;
   and for the accomplishing of the like design upon verse 39 (which
   farther clears the mind and intendment of Christ in the words), verse
   40 is omitted, lie tells you that it is the wilt of the Father that
   every one that comes to him, that is, that believes on him, have
   everlasting life. What is everlasting life in the gospel is well known
   from John xvii. 3. And unto this bestowing on them everlasting life,
   his raising of them at the last day, as was mentioned, is a necessary
   consequent, -- namely, that they may be brought to the full and
   complete fruition of that life which here in some measure they are made
   partakers of. Even in the words of verse 39, that passage, "I should
   lose nothing," extends itself to the whole compass of our Saviour's
   duty in reference to his Father's will for the safeguarding of
   believers. And is it only death, and the state of dissolution of body
   and soul, that it is the will of God that he should deliver them from,
   and the power of that, that it should not have dominion over them in
   the morning? The apostle tells us that he came to do the will of God,
   whereby we are sanctified, Heb. x. 9, 10. It was the will of God that
   he should sanctify us; and he tells his Father that he had kept all his
   own in the world, John xvii. 12; which, doubtless, was not his raising
   them from the dead. If he be the Mediator of the covenant of grace, if
   the promises of God be yea and amen in him, if he be our Head, Husband,
   and elder Brother, our Advocate and Intercessor, our Shepherd and
   Saviour, his keeping us from being lost extends itself no less
   effectually to our preservation from utter ruin in this life than to
   our raising at the last day; yea, and that exceptive particle alla
   includes this preservation, as well as leads us to the addition of the
   other favour and privilege of being raised to glory at the last day. In
   a word, this whole discourse is added to make good that gracious
   promise of our Saviour, John vi. 35, "He that cometh to me shall never
   hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst;" which how it
   can be done by a naked engagement for the resurrection of them that
   come to him and abide with him, if many do, and most of all them that
   come to him may, depart from him and fall into everlasting ruin, needs
   Mr Goodwin's farther labour and pains to unfold. What is lastly added
   concerning Christ's doing the utmost of his Father's pleasure for their
   custody, but the fault is their own who fall away, is the same
   inconsistent, ridiculous assertion with that erewhile considered; with
   this addition, that whereas it is his Father's pleasure that they be
   saved, Christ doth his pleasure to the utmost, and yet saved they are
   not. And so much (if not too much) for the vindication of this
   testimony witnessing to the truth that we have in hand.

   Matt. xxiv. 24 comes in the next place to be considered (an
   unquestionable evidence to the truth), and that voluntarily, of its own
   accord, speaking so plain to the matter in hand, that it were a sin
   against clear light to refuse to attend unto it; so far is it from
   being "compelled to bear the cross of this service," as Mr Goodwin
   phrases the matter, chap. x. sect 9, pp. 181-183. "?They shall seduce,
   if it were possible, the very elect.' Hence," saith he, "it is inferred
   that the deceiving or seducing of them that believe is a thing
   impossible; which is the drawing of darkness out of light." Strange! to
   me it seems so far from a forced inference, or a strained drawing of a
   conclusion, that it is but the conversion of the terms of the same
   identical supposition. He that says they shall deceive the very elect,
   if it were possible, so mighty shall be their prevalency in seducing,
   seems to me (and would, I doubt not, do so to others, did not their
   prejudices and engagements force them to stop their ears and shut their
   eyes) to say that it is impossible the elect should be seduced.

   But let the place, as it deserves, be more distinctly considered; it is
   among them which I refer to the head of the purposes of God, and a
   purpose of God there is (though not expressed, yet) included in the
   words. The impossibility of the seduction of some persons from the
   faith is here asserted. Whence doth this impossibility arise? Not from
   any thing in themselves, -- not from their own careful consideration of
   all the concernments of their condition; the only preservative in such
   a season, if some, who pretend themselves skilful and experienced, yea
   almost the only physicians of souls, may be believed. They can never
   stand upon such sands against that opposition they shall be sure to
   meet withal. Our Saviour therefore intimates whence the impossibility
   expressed doth flow, in a description of the persons of whom it is
   affirmed, in reference to the purpose of God concerning them. They are
   the "elect," those whom God hath "chosen before the foundation of the
   world, that they should be holy and without blame before him in love."
   His "purpose according to election" must stand firm, and therefore "the
   election" itself shall obtain. [108] This, then, is that which is here
   affirmed: God having chosen some, or elected them to life, according to
   the "purpose which he purposed in himself," and faith being bestowed on
   them, they believing on the account of their being "ordained to eternal
   life," it is impossible they should be seduced so as to be thrown down
   from that state and condition of acceptance with God (for the substance
   of it) wherein they stand. [109]

   Some few observations will farther clear the mind of the Holy Ghost,
   and obviate the exceptions that are put in against our receiving the
   words in their plain, proper, obvious signification. Observe, then, --

   1. Upon the intimation of the great power and prevalency of seducers,
   our Saviour adds this, as a matter of great consolation to true and
   sound believers, that notwithstanding all this, all their attempts,
   however advantaged by force or subtlety, yet they shall be preserved.
   This the whole context enforceth us to receive, and our adversaries to
   confess that at least a great difficulty of their seduction is
   intimated. And it arises with no less evidence that this difficulty is
   distinguishing in respect of the persons exposed to seduction;-- that
   some are elect, who should be seduced if it were possible; others not,
   that may and shall be prevailed against.

   2. The bottom of the consolation, in the freedom of the persons here
   spoken of from falling under the prevailing power of seducers, consists
   in this, that they are the elect of God, such as on a personal
   consideration are chosen of God from all eternity, to be kept and
   preserved by his power to salvation, notwithstanding any
   interveniencies or oppositions which he will suffer to lie in their
   way. "But," saith Mr Goodwin, "these men, at least before their
   calling, are as liable to be deceived or seduced as other men. This is
   their own confession; and Paul says that they were sometimes deceived,
   Titus iii. 3."

   Ans. An exception, doubtless, unworthy him that makes it; who, had he
   not resolved to say all that ever had been said by any to the business
   in hand, would scarcely, I presume, have made use thereof. The,
   seduction of persons is not opposed to their election, but to their
   believing. Mention is made of their election, to distinguish them from
   those other professors which should be seduced, and to discover the
   foundation of their stability under their trials; but it is of them as
   believers (in which consideration the attempts of seducers are advanced
   against them) that he speaks. It is not the seducing of the elect as
   elect, but of believers who are elect, and because they are elected,
   that is denied.

   3. That it is a seduction unto a total and final departure from Christ
   and Faith in him whose impossibility in respect of the election is here
   asserted. "But," saith Mr Goodwin, chap. x. sect. 10, p. 181, "this is
   to presume, not to argue or believe; for there is not the least ground
   in the word whereon to build such an interpretation." But the truth is,
   without any presumption or much labour for proof, the falsity of this
   exception will quickly appear to any one that shall but view the
   context. It is evidently such a seduction as they are exposed unto and
   fall under who endure not unto the end, that they may be saved, Matt.
   xxiv. 13; and they who are excepted upon the account mentioned are
   opposed to them who, being seduced, and their love being made cold, and
   their iniquities abounding, perish everlastingly, verses 11, 12.

   4. It is, then, a denial of their being cast out by the power of
   seducers from their state and condition of believing and acceptation
   with God wherein they stand, that our Saviour here asserts, and gives
   out to their consolation, -- they shall not be seduced, that is, drawn
   off from that state wherein they are to a state of unregeneracy,
   infidelity, and enmity to God so that, as Mr Goodwin observes in the
   next place, we deny them, from hence, not only to be subject to a final
   but also to a total seduction.

   5. We grant that notwithstanding the security given, which respects the
   state and condition of the persons spoken of, yet they may be, and
   often are, seduced and drawn aside into ways that are not right, into
   errors and false doctrines, through the "cunning sleight of men who lie
   in wait to deceive," but never into such (as to any abode in them)
   which are inconsistent with the union with their Head and his life in
   them.

   The errors and ways whereinto they are, or may be, seduced are either
   such as, though dangerous, yea, in their consequences pernicious, yet
   have not such an aspect upon the faith of believers as to deny a
   possibility of union and holding the Head upon other accounts. I doubt
   not but that men for a season may not know, may disbelieve and deny,
   some fundamental articles of Christian religion, and yet not be
   absolutely concluded not to hold the Head by any sinew or ligament, to
   have no influence of life by any other means. Was it not so with the
   apostles when they questioned the resurrection of Christ, and with the
   Corinthians who denied the resurrection of the saints? -- an abode, I
   confess, in either of which errors would, when the consequences of them
   are manifested, prove pernicious to the souls of men; but that they
   have in themselves such an absolute repugnancy unto and inconsistency
   with the life of Christ, however considered, as that their
   entertainment for a season should be immediately exclusive thereof, I
   suppose Mr Goodwin himself will not say. In this sense, then, we grant
   that true, saving, justifying faith may consist with the denial of some
   fundamental articles of Christian religion for a season; but that any
   true believer can persist in such a heresy we deny, he having the
   promise of the Spirit to lead him into all necessary truth.

   There are such ways and things as in their own nature have an
   inconsistency with the life of Christ, as the abnegation of Christ
   himself. But this also we affirm to be twofold, or to receive a twofold
   consideration:-- 1. It may be resolved, upon consideration, with the
   deliberate consent of the whole soul; which we utterly deny that
   believers can or shall be left unto for a moment, or that ever any true
   believer was so. 2. Such as may be squeezed out of the mouths of men by
   the surprisal of some great, dreadful, and horrible temptation, without
   any habitual or cordial assent to any such abomination, or disaffection
   to Christ, or resolute rebellion against him. Thus Peter fell into the
   abnegation of Christ, whose faith yet under it did not perish, if our
   Saviour was heard in his prayer for him, having an eye to that very
   temptation of his wherein he was to be tried, and his fall under it. In
   the first sense are those words of our Saviour, Matt. x. 33, to be
   understood, and not in the latter. Christ was so far from denying Peter
   before his Father under his abnegation of him, that he never manifested
   more care and tenderness towards any believer than towards him in that
   condition. And this wholly removes Mr Goodwin's 10th section out of our
   way, without troubling of ourselves to hold up that distinction of a
   final denial of Christ, and that not final, seeing in all probability
   he set it up himself that he might have the honour to cast it down.

   What follows in Mr Goodwin from the beginning of sect. 11, chap. x., to
   the end of sect. 17, is little more than a translation of the
   Remonstrants' sophistry in vexing this text in their Synodalia; which
   he knows full well where to find discussed and removed. For the sake of
   our English readers, I shall not avoid the consideration of it. I
   affirm, then, that the phrase ei dunaton here denotes the impossibility
   of the event denied, the manner of speech, circumstances of the place,
   with the aim of our Saviour in speaking, exacting this sense of the
   words. The words are, Hoste planesai, ei dunaton, kai tous eklektous.
   It is the constant import of the word hoste to design the event of the
   thing which, by what attends it, is asserted or denied (so Gal. ii. 13;
   Matt. viii. 28, xv. 31; 1 Thess. i. 8), neither is it ever used for
   hina. In the place by some instanced for it, Rom. vii. 6, it points
   clearly at the event. Hina is sometimes put for it, but not on the
   contrary. And the words ei duntaon, though not so used always (although
   sometimes they are, as Gal. iv. 15), do signify at least a moral
   impossibility, when they refer to the endeavours of men; but relating
   to the prediction of an event by God himself, they are equivalent to an
   absolute negation of it. That of Acts xx. 16 is urged to the contrary.
   Paul hoped ei dunaton, to be at Jerusalem at Pentecost. "?If it be
   possible' here cannot imply an impossibility as to the event," says Mr
   Goodwin. But are these places parallel? Are, all places where the same
   phrase is used always to be expounded in the same sense? The terms
   here, "If it be possible," respect not the futurition of the thing, but
   the uncertainty to Paul of its possibility or impossibility; the
   uncertainty, I say, of Paul in his conjecture whether he should get to
   Jerusalem by such a time or no, of which he was ignorant. Did our
   Saviour here conjecture about a thing whereof he was ignorant whether
   it would come to pass or no? We say not, then, that in this place,
   where ei dunaton is expressive of the uncertainty of him that attempts
   any thing of its event, that it affirms an impossibility of it, and so
   to insinuate that Paul made all haste to do that which he knew was
   impossible for him to do; but that the words are used in these two
   places in distinct senses, according to the enclosure that is made of
   them by others. "But," saith Mr Goodwin, "to say that Paul might be
   ignorant whether his being at Jerusalem by Pentecost might be possible
   or no, and that he only resolved to make trial of the truth herein to
   the utmost, is to asperse this great apostle with a ridiculous
   imputation of ignorance." And why so, I pray you? It is true he was a
   great apostle indeed; but it was no part of his apostolical furnishment
   to know in what space of time he might make a sea-voyage. Had Mr
   Goodwin ever been at sea, he would not have thought it ridiculous
   ignorance for a man to be uncertain in what space of time he might sail
   from Miletus to Ptolemais. Paul had a short time to finish this voyage
   in. He was at Philippi at the days of unleavened bread, and afterward,
   verse 6; thence he was five days sailing to Troas, verse 6; and there
   he abode seven days more. It may well be supposed that it cost him not
   less than seven days more to come to Miletus, verses 13-15. How long he
   tarried there is uncertain. Evident, however, it is, that there was a
   very small space of time left to get to Jerusalem by Pentecost. Paul
   was one that had met not only with calms and contrary winds, but
   shipwreck also, 2 Cor. xi. 25; so that he might well doubt whether it
   were possible for him to make his voyage in that space of time he had
   designed to do it in, and this surely without the least disparagement
   to his apostolical knowledge and wisdom. In brief, when this phrase
   relates to the cares and desires of men, and unto any thing of their
   ignorance of the issue, it may design the uncertainty of the event, as
   in this place and that of Rom. xii. 18; but when it points at the event
   itself, it peremptorily designs its accomplishment or not, according to
   the tendency of the expression, which affirms or denies.
   Notwithstanding, then, all evasions, the simple, direct, and proper
   sense of our Saviour's words, -- who is setting forth and aggravating
   the prevalency of seducers in evil times, by him then foretold, -- is,
   that it shall be such and so great as that, if it were not impossible
   upon the account of their election, they should prevail against the
   very elect themselves. But, --

   6. Suppose it be granted that the words refer to the endeavours of the
   seducers in this place, yet they must needs deny their prevalency as to
   the end aimed at. It is asserted either to be possible that the elect
   should be so seduced, or not. If not, we have what we aim at. If it be
   possible, and so here asserted, the total of this expression of our
   Saviour will be resolved into a conclusion certainly most remote from
   his intendment: "If it be possible that the elect may be seduced, then
   shall they be seduced; but it is possible (say our adversaries),
   therefore they shall be seduced." Neither doth that which Mr Goodwin
   urgeth, sect. 12, out of the Synodalia before mentioned, pp. 314, 315,
   at all prove that the words denote only a difficulty of the thing aimed
   at, with relation to the earnest endeavours of seducers. Pros to doth
   indeed intimate their endeavours, but withal their fruitlessness as to
   the event. Ei dunaton is not referred (as in the example of Paul,) to
   the thoughts of their minds, but to the success foretold by Christ.
   That emphatical and diacritical expression in the description of them
   against whom their attempts are, "Even the very elect," argues their
   exemption. "And if by elect' are meant simply and only believers as
   such, how comes this emphatical expression and description of them to
   be used, when they alone and no others can be seduced? for those who
   seem to believe only cannot be said to fall from the faith," say our
   adversaries. It is true, the professors of Christianity adhered of old
   under many trials, for the greater part, with eminent constancy to
   their profession; yet is not any thing eminently herein held out in
   that saying which Mr Goodwin calls proverbial in Galen, he speaking of
   the followers of Moses the same as of the followers of Christ. What
   else follows in Mr Goodwin from the same author is nothing but the
   pressing of, I think, one of the most absurd arguments that ever
   learned men made use of in any controversy; and yet, such as it is, we
   shall meet with it over and over (as we have done often already),
   before we arrive at the end of this discourse; and, therefore, to avoid
   tediousness, I shall not here insist upon it. With its mention it shall
   be passed by. It is concerning the uselessness of means, and
   exhortations unto the use of them, if the end to be attained by them be
   irrevocably determined, although those exhortations are part of the
   means appointed for the accomplishment of the end so designed. I shall
   not, as I said, in this place insist upon it; one thing only shall I
   observe. In sect. 17, he grants, "That God is able to determine the
   wills of the elect to the use of means proper and sufficient to prevent
   their being deceived." By this "determining the wills of the elect to
   the use of proper means," the efficacy of grace in and with believers,
   to a certain preservation of them to the end, is intended. It is the
   thing he opposeth, as we are informed in the next words: "He hath
   nowhere declared himself willing or resolved to do it." That by this
   one assertion Mr Goodwin hath absolved our doctrine from all the absurd
   consequences and guilt of I know not what abominations, which in
   various criminations he hath charged upon it, is evident upon the first
   view and consideration. All that we affirm God to do, Mr Goodwin grants
   that he can do. Now, if God should do all he is able, there would no
   absurdity or evil that is truly so follow. What he can do, that he can
   decree to do; and this is the sum of our doctrine, which he hath chosen
   to oppose. God, we say, hath everlastingly purposed to give, and doth
   actually give, his Holy Spirit to believers, to put forth such an
   exceeding greatness of power as whereby, in the use of means, they
   shall certainly be preserved to salvation. "This God can do," says our
   author. This concession being made by the Remonstrants in their
   Synodalia, Mr Goodwin, I presume, thought it but duty to be as free as
   his predecessors, and therefore consented unto it also, although it be
   an axe laid at the root of almost all the arguments he sets up against
   the truth, as shall hereafter be farther manifested.

   I draw now to a close of those places which, among many others omitted,
   tender themselves unto the proof of the stable, unchangeable purpose of
   God, concerning the safeguarding and preservation of believers in his
   love and unto salvation. I shall mention one or two more, and close
   this second scriptural demonstration of the truth in hand. The first is
   that eminent place of Eph. i. 3-5, "Blessed be the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
   in heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him
   before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without
   blame before him in love; having predestinated us unto the adoption of
   children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of
   his will." Verse 3, the apostle summarily blesseth God for all the
   spiritual mercies which in Jesus Christ he blesseth his saints withal;
   of all which, verse 4, he discovereth the fountain and spring, which is
   his free choosing of them before the foundation of the world. That an
   eternal act of the will of God is hereby designed is beyond dispute;
   and it is that "foundation of God" on which the whole of the building
   mentioned and portrayed in the following verse is laid. All the grace
   and favour of God towards his saints, in their justification, adoption,
   and glow, all the fruits of the Spirit, which they enjoy in faith and
   sanctification, flow from this one fountain; and these the apostle
   describes at large in the verses following. The aim of God in this
   eternal and unchangeable act of his will, he tells us, is, that we
   should be "without blame before him in love." Certainly cursed
   apostates, backsliders in heart, in whom his soul takes no pleasure,
   are very far from being without blame before God in love. Those that
   are within the compass of this purpose of God must be preserved unto
   that state and condition which God aims to bring them unto, by all the
   fruits and issues of that purpose of his, which was pointed at before.

   A scripture of the like importance unto that before named is 2 Thess.
   ii. 13, 14, "God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation
   through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto
   he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
   Jesus Christ." First, The same fountain of all spiritual and eternal
   mercy with that mentioned in the other place is here also expressed;
   and that is, God's choosing of us by an everlasting act, or designing
   us to the end intended by a free, eternal, unchangeable purpose of his
   will. Secondly, The end aimed at by the Lord in that purpose is here
   more clearly set down in a twofold expression:-- 1. Salvation: Verse
   13, "God hath chosen you to salvation." That is the thing which he
   aimed to accomplish for them, and the end he intended to bring them to
   in his choosing of them. And, 2. Verse 14, "The glory of the Lord Jesus
   Christ," or the obtaining a portion in that glory which Christ
   purchased and procured for them, with their being with him to behold
   his glory. And, thirdly, You have the means whereby God will certainly
   bring about and accomplish this his design and purpose, whereof there
   are three most eminent acts expressed:-- 1. Vocation, or their calling
   by the gospel, verse 14; 2. Sanctification, "Through sanctification of
   the Spirit;" and, 3. Justification, which they receive by "belief of
   the truth," verse 13. This much, then, is wrapped up in this text: God
   having, in his unchangeable purpose, fore-appointed his to salvation
   and glory, certainly to be obtained, through the effectual working of
   the Spirit and free justification in the blood of Christ, it cannot be
   but that they shall be preserved unto the enjoyment of what they are so
   designed unto.

   To sum up what hath been spoken from these purposes of God to the
   establishment of the truth we have in hand: Those whom God hath
   purposed by effectual means to preserve to the enjoyment of eternal
   life and glory in his favour and acceptation, can never so fall from
   his love, or be so cast out of his grace, as to come short of the end
   designed, or ever be totally rejected of God. The truth of this
   proposition depends upon what hath been said, and may farther be
   insisted on, concerning the unchangeableness and absoluteness of the
   eternal purposes of God, the glory whereof men shall never be able
   sacrilegiously to rob him of. Thence the assumption is, concerning all
   true believers and truly sanctified persons, there are purposes of God
   that they shall be so preserved to such ends, etc., as hath been
   abundantly proved by an induction of particular instances; and
   therefore it is impossible they should ever be so cast out of the
   favour of God as not to be infallibly preserved to the end. Which is
   our second demonstration of the truth in hand.

Chapter IV. The argument from the covenant of grace.

   An entrance into the consideration of the covenant of grace, and our
   argument from thence for the unchangeableness of the love of God unto
   believers -- The intendment of the ensuing discourse -- Gen. xvii. 7
   opened and explained, with the confirmation of the argument in hand
   from thence -- That argument vindicated and cleared of objections --
   Confirmed by some observations -- Jer. xxxii. 38-40 compared with chap.
   xxxi. 31-34 -- The truth under consideration from thence clearly
   confirmed -- The certainty, immutability, and infallible
   accomplishment, of all the promises of the new covenant demonstrated:
   1. From the removal of all causes of alteration; 2. From the Mediator
   and his undertaking therein; 3. From the faithfulness of God -- One
   instance from the former considerations -- The endeavour of Mr G. to
   answer our argument from this place -- His observation on and from the
   text considered -- 1. This promise not made to the Jews only, 2. Nor to
   all the nation of the Jews, proved from Rom. xi. 7; not intending
   principally their deliverance from Babylon -- His inferences from his
   former observations weighed -- 1. The promise made to the body of the
   people of the Jews typically only; 2. An exposition borrowed of Socinus
   rejected; 3. The promise not appropriated to the time of the captivity,
   and the disadvantage ensuing to Mr G.'s cause upon such an exposition
   -- The place insisted on compared with Ezek. xi. 17-20 -- That place
   cleared -- A fourth objection answered -- This promise always fulfilled
   -- The spiritual part of it accomplished during the captivity -- God's
   intention not frustrated -- How far the civil prosperity of the Jews
   was concerned in this promise -- Promises of spiritual and temporal
   things compared -- The covenant of grace how far conditional -- Mr G.'s
   sense of this place expressed -- Borrowed from Faustus Socinus -- The
   inconsistency of it with the mind of the Holy Ghost demonstrated, also
   with what himself hath elsewhere delivered -- No way suited to be the
   answer of our argument from the place -- The same interpretation
   farther disproved -- An immediate divine efficacy held out in the words
   -- Conversion and pardon of sins promised -- Differenced from the grace
   and promises of the old covenant -- Contribution of means put by Mr G.
   in the place of effectual operation of the thing itself, farther
   disproved -- How, when, and to whom this promise was fulfilled, farther
   declared -- An objection arising upon that consideration answered --
   Conjectures ascribed to God by Mr G. -- The real foundation of all
   divine predictions -- The promise utterly enervated, and rendered of
   none effect by Mr G.'s exposition -- Its consistency with the
   prophecies of the rejection of the Jews -- The close of the argument
   from the covenant of grace.

   Having shown the unchangeable stability of the love and favour of God
   towards his saints from the immutability of his own nature and
   purposes, manifested by an induction of sundry particular instances
   from eminent places of Scripture, wherein both the one and the other
   are held out as the foundation of what we affirm, I proceed to farther
   clear and demonstrate the same important truth from the first way of
   declaration whereby God hath assured them that it shall be to them
   according to the tenor of the proposition insisted on; and that is his
   covenant of grace. The principium essendi of this truth, if I may so
   say, is in the decrees and purposes of God; the principium cognoscendi,
   in his covenant, promise, and oath, which also add much to the real
   stability of it, the truth and faithfulness of God in them being
   thereby peculiarly engaged therein.

   It is not in my purpose to handle the nature of the covenant of grace,
   but only briefly to look into it, so far as it hath influence into the
   truth in hand. The covenant of grace, then, as it inwraps the
   unchangeable love and favour of God towards those who are taken into
   the bond thereof, is that which lieth under our present consideration.
   The other great branch of it (upon the account of the same faithfulness
   of God), communicating permanency or perseverance in itself unto the
   saints, securing their continuance with God, shall, the Lord assisting,
   more peculiarly be explained when we arrive to the head of our
   discourse, unless enough to that purpose may fall in occasionally in
   the progress of this business.

   For our present purpose, the producing and vindicating of one or two
   texts of Scripture, being unavoidably expressive towards the end aimed
   at, shall suffice.

   The first of these is Gen. xvii. 7, "I will establish my covenant
   between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an
   everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after
   thee." This is that which God engageth himself unto in this covenant of
   grace, that he will for everlasting be a God to him and his faithful
   seed. Though the external administration of the covenant was given to
   Abraham and his carnal seed, yet the effectual dispensation of the
   grace of the covenant is peculiar to them only who are the children of
   the promise, the remnant of Abraham according to election, with all
   that in all nations were to be blessed in him and in his seed, Christ
   Jesus. Ishmael, though circumcised, was to be put out, and not to be
   heir with Isaac, nor to abide in the house for ever, as the son of the
   promise was, Gal. iv. 22, 23, 30. Now, the apostle tells you, look what
   blessings faithful Abraham received by virtue of this promise, the same
   do all believers receive: Chap. iii. 9, "They which be of faith are
   blessed with faithful Abraham;" which he proves (in the words
   foregoing) from Gen. xii. 3, because all nations were to be blessed in
   him. What blessing, then, was it that was here made over to Abraham?
   All the blessings that from God are conveyed in and by his seed, Jesus
   Christ (in whom both he and we are blessed), are inwrapped therein.
   What they are the apostle tells you, Eph. i. 3; they are "all spiritual
   blessings." If perseverance, if the continuance of the love and favour
   of God towards us, be a spiritual blessing, both Abraham and all his
   seed, all faithful ones throughout the world, are blessed with it in
   Jesus Christ; and if God's continuing to be a God to them for ever will
   enforce this blessing (being but the same thing in another expression),
   it is here likewise asserted.

   It is importunately excepted, "That though God undertake to be our God
   in an everlasting covenant, and upon that account to bless us with the
   whole blessing that is conveyed by the promised seed, yet if we abide
   not with him, if we forsake him, he will also cease to be our God, and
   cease to bless us with the blessing which on others in Jesus Christ he
   will bestow."

   Ans. If there be a necessity to smite this evasion so often as we shall
   meet with it, it must be cut into a hundred pieces. For the present, I
   shall only observe two evils it is attended withal:-- First, It takes
   no notice that God, who hath undertaken to be a God unto us, hath, with
   the like truth, power, and faithfulness, undertaken that we shall abide
   to be his people. So is his love in his covenant expressed by its
   efficacy to this end and purpose, Deut. xxx. 6, "The Lord thy God will
   circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy
   God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest
   live." Secondly, It denies the continuance of the love of God to us to
   the end to be any part of the blessings wherewith we are blessed in
   Jesus Christ; for if it be, it could no more be suspended on any
   condition in us than the glorification of believers that abide so to
   the end.

   This, then, is inwrapped in this promise of the covenant unto the
   elect, with whom it is established: God will be a God to them for ever,
   and that to bless them with all the blessings which he communicates in
   and by the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised seed. The continuance of his
   favour to the end is to us unquestionably a spiritual blessing (if any
   one be otherwise minded, I shall not press to share with him in his
   apprehension); and if so, it is in Christ, and shall certainly be
   enjoyed by them to whom God is a God in covenant. He that can suppose
   that he shall prevail with the saints of God to believe it will make
   for their consolation to apprehend that there is no engagement in his
   covenant, assuring them of the continuance of the favour of God unto
   them to the end of their pilgrimage, hath no reason to doubt or
   question the issue of any thing he shall undertake to persuade men
   unto. Doubtless he will find it very difficult with them who, in times
   of spiritual straits and pressures, have closed with this engagement of
   God in the covenant, and have had experience of its bearing them
   through all perplexities and entanglements, when the waves of
   temptation were ready to go over their souls. Certainly David was in
   another persuasion when, upon a view of all the difficulties he had
   passed through, and his house was to meet withal, he concludes, 2 Sam.
   xxiii. 5, "God hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in
   all things and sure: this is all my salvation, and all my desire." The
   covenant from whence he had his sure mercies, not changeable, not
   alterable, not liable to failings, as the temporal prosperity of his
   house was, was that he rejoiced in.

   I shall close this with two observations:--

   First, It may, doubtless, and on serious consideration will, seem
   strange to any one acquainted in the least measure with God and his
   faithfulness, that, in a covenant established in the blood of Christ,
   he should freely promise to his that he would be a God unto them, --
   that is, that he would abide with them in the power, goodness,
   righteousness, and faithfulness, of a God, that he would be an
   all-sufficient God to them for ever, -- yet, when he might with an
   almighty facility prevent it, and so answer and fulfil his engagement
   to the utmost, he should suffer them to become such villains and devils
   in wickedness that it should be utterly impossible for him, in the
   blood of his Son and the riches of his grace, to continue a God unto
   them; this, I say, seemeth strange to me, and not to be received
   without casting the greatest reproach imaginable on the goodness,
   faithfulness, and righteousness, of God.

   Secondly, If this promise be not absolute, immutable, unchangeable,
   independent on any thing in us, it is impossible that any one should
   plead it with the Lord, but only upon the account of the sense that he
   hath of his own accomplishment of the condition on which the promise
   doth depend. I can almost suppose that the whole generation of
   believers will rise up against this assertion to remove it out of their
   way of walking with God. This I know, that most of them who at any time
   have walked in darkness and have had no light will reprove it to the
   faces of them that maintain it, and profess that God hath witnessed the
   contrary truth to their hearts. [110] Are we, in the covenant of grace,
   left to our own hearts, ways, and walkings? Is it not differenced from
   that which is abolished? Is it not the great distinguishing character
   of it that all the promises of it are stable, and shall certainly be
   accomplished in Jesus Christ? [111]

   One place I shall add more, wherein our intendment is positively
   expressed, beyond all possibility of any colourable evasion, especially
   considering the explication, enlargement, and application, which in
   other places it hath received. The place intended is Jer. xxxii. 38-40,
   "They shall be my people, and I will be their God: and I will give them
   one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of
   them, and of their children after them: and I will make an everlasting
   covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them
   good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not
   depart from me;" -- in conjunction with these words, of the same
   importance, chap. xxxi. 31-34, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
   that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the
   house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their
   fathers: but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
   of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their
   inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and
   they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his
   neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they
   shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
   saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
   their sin no more."

   First, The thesis under demonstration is directly and positively
   affirmed, in most significant and emphatical words, by God himself.
   Seeing, then, the testimony of his holy prophets and apostles
   concerning him are so excepted against and so lightly set by, let us
   try if men will reverence himself, and cease contending with him when
   he appeareth in judgment. Saith he, then, to believers, those whom he
   taketh into covenant with him: "This is my covenant with you" (in the
   performance whereof his all-sufficiency, truth, and faithfulness, with
   all other his glorious attributes, are eminently engaged), "I will be
   your God" (what that expression intends is known, and the Lord here
   explains, by instancing in some eminent spiritual mercies thence
   flowing, as sanctification, and acceptance with him by the forgiveness
   of sins), "and that for ever, in an everlasting covenant, and I will
   not turn away from you to do you good." This plainly God saith of
   himself, and this is all we say of him in the business, and which
   (having so good an author) we must say, whether men will hear or
   whether they will forbear. Whether it be right in the sight of God to
   hearken unto men more than unto God, let all judge. Truly they have a
   sad task, in my apprehension, who are forced to sweat and labour to
   alleviate and take off the testimony of God.

   Secondly, That the way the Lord proposeth to secure his love to his is
   upon terms of advantage, of glory and honour to himself, to take away
   all scruple which on that hand might arise, is fully also expressed.
   Sin is the only differencing thing between God and man; and hereinto it
   hath a double influence:-- First, Moral, in its guilt, deserving that
   God should cast off a sinner, and prevailing with him, upon the account
   of justice, so to do. Secondly, Efficient, by causing men, through its
   power and deceitfulness, to depart from God, until, as backsliders in
   heart, they are filled with their own ways. [112] Take away these two,
   provide for security on this hand, and there is no possible case
   imaginable of separation between God and man once brought together in
   peace and unity. For both these doth God hero undertake, For the first,
   saith he, "I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin
   no more," chap. xxxi. 34. The guilt of sin shall be done away in
   Christ, and that on terms of the greatest honour and glory to the
   justice of God that can be apprehended: "God hath set forth Christ to
   be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
   righteousness for the remission of sins that are past," Rom. iii. 25.
   And for the latter, that that may be thoroughly prevented, saith God,
   "The care shall lie on me; I will put my law in their inward parts, and
   write it in their hearts,'?" chap. xxxi. 33; "I will put my fear in
   their hearts, that they shall not depart from me," chap. xxxii. 40. So
   that the continuance of his love is secured against all possible
   interveniences whatever, by an assured prevention of all such as have
   an inconsistency therewithal.

   The apostle Paul, setting out the covenant which God ratified in the
   blood of Christ, which shall never be broken, takes the description of
   it from this place of the prophet, Heb. viii. 9-12; and therein fixeth
   particularly on the unchangeableness of it, in opposition to the
   covenant which went before, which was liable to mutation, when if these
   differed only in the approbation of several qualifications, they come
   to the same end; for if this covenant depend on conditions by ourselves
   and in our own strength, with the advantage of its proposal to us,
   attended with exhortations, and therefore by us to be fulfilled, how
   was it distinguished from that made with the people when they came out
   of Egypt? But in this very thing the difference of it lieth, as the
   apostle asserts, verses 6-8. The immutability of this covenant, and the
   certain product of all the mercy promised in it might, were that our
   present task, be easily demonstrated; as, --

   First, From the removal of all causes of alteration. When two enter
   into covenant and agreement, no one can undertake that that covenant
   shall be firm and stable if it equally depend upon both; yea both, it
   may be, are changeable, and so actually changed before the
   accomplishing of the thing engaged about therein: however, though the
   one should be faithful, yet the other may fail, and so the covenant be
   broken. Thus it was with God and Adam. It could not be undertaken that
   that covenant should be kept inviolable, because though God continues
   faithful, yet Adam might prove (as indeed he did) faithless; and so the
   covenant was disannulled, as to any power of knitting together God and
   man. [Thus it is with] the covenant between husband and wife; the one
   party cannot undertake that the whole covenant shall be observed,
   because the other may prove treacherous. In this covenant the case is
   otherwise. God himself hath undertaken the whole, both for his
   continuing with us and our continuing with him. Now, he is one, God is
   one, and there is not another, that they should fail and disannul this
   agreement. Though there be sundry persons in covenant, yet there is but
   one undertaker on all hands, and that is God himself. It doth not
   depend upon the will of another, but of him only who is faithful, who
   cannot lie, who cannot deceive, who will make all his engagements good
   to the utmost. He is an all-sufficient one; "he will work, and who
   shall let him? "The Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
   it?" Yea, he is an unchangeable one; what he undertakes shall come to
   pass. Blessed be his name that he hath not laid the foundation of a
   covenant in the blood of his dear Son, laid out the riches of his
   wisdom, grace, and power about it, and then left it to us and our frail
   will to carry it on, that it should be in our power to make void the
   great work of his mercy! Whence, then, I say, should any change be, the
   whole depending on one, and him immutable?

   Secondly, Seeing that God and man, having been at so great a distance
   as they were by sin, must needs meet in some mediator, some middle
   person, in whom and by whose blood (as covenants usually were confirmed
   by blood) this covenant must be ratified, consider who this is, and
   what he hath done for the establishing of it: "There is one God, and
   one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus," 1 Tim. ii. 5.
   He is the "surety of this testament," Heb. vii. 22; the "mediator of
   this better covenant, established upon better promises," chap. viii. 6.
   Neither is this surety or mediator subject to change; he is "the same
   yesterday, and today, and for ever," chap. xiii. 8. But though he be so
   in himself, yet is the work so that is committed to him? Saith the
   apostle, "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
   the glory of God by us," 2 Cor. i. 20. God hath in him and by him
   ascertained all the promises of the covenant, that not one of them
   should be broken: disannulled, frustrated, or come short of an
   accomplishment. God hath so confirmed them in him, that he hath at his
   death made a legacy of them, and bequeathed them in a testamentary
   dispensation to the covenanters, Heb. ix. 15-17. And what he hath
   farther done for the assurance of his saints' abiding with God shall
   afterward be declared.

   Thirdly, The faithfulness of God is oftentimes peculiarly mentioned in
   reference to this very thing: "The God which keepeth covenant" is his
   name. That which he hath to keep is all that in covenant he
   undertaketh. Now, in this covenant he undertaketh, -- first, That he
   will never forsake us; secondly, That we shall never forsake him. His
   faithfulness is engaged to both these; and if either part should fail,
   what would the Lord do to his great name, "The God which keepeth
   covenant?"

   Notwithstanding the undertaking of God on both sides in this covenant;
   notwithstanding his faithfulness in the performance of what he
   undertaketh; notwithstanding the ratification of it in the blood of
   Jesus, and all that he hath done for the confirmation of it;
   notwithstanding its differing from the covenant that was disannulled on
   this account, that that was broken, which this shall never be (that
   being broken not as to the truth of the proposition wherein it is
   contained, "Do this and live," but as to the success of it in bringing
   any to God); notwithstanding the seal of the oath that God set unto it,
   -- they, I say, who, notwithstanding all these things, will hang the
   unchangeableness of this covenant of God upon the slipperiness, and
   uncertainty, and lubricity of the will of man, "let them walk in the
   light of the sparks which themselves have kindled;" we will walk in the
   light of the Lord our God.

   When first I perused Mr Goodwin's exceptions to this testimony, chap.
   x. sect. 52-56, pp. 219-224, finding them opposed not so much nor so
   directly to our inference from this place as to the design, intendment,
   and arguing of the apostle, Rom. ix.-xi., and to the re-enforcing of
   the objections by him answered, casting again the "rock of offence" in
   the way by him removed, I thought to have passed it without any reply,
   being not convinced that it was possible for the author himself to be
   satisfied either with his own exposition of this place or his
   exceptions unto ours; but arriving at length to the close of his
   discourse, I found him "quasi re preclarè gestâ," to triumph in his
   victory, expressing much confidence that the world of saints, who have
   hitherto bottomed much of their faith and consolation on the covenant
   of God in these words expressed, will vail their faith and
   understanding to his uncontrollable dictates, and not once make mention
   of the name of God in this place any more. Truly, for my part, I must
   take the boldness to say that, before the coming forth of his learned
   treatise, I had read, and, according to my weak ability, weighed and
   considered, whatever either Arminians or Socinians (from the founder of
   which sect their and his interpretation of this place is borrowed) had
   entered against the interpretation insisted on, that I could by any
   means attain the sight of, and was not in the least shaken by any of
   their reasonings from rejoicing in the grace of God, as to the
   unchangeableness of his love to believers, and the certainty of their
   perseverance with him to the end, therein expressed; and I must add,
   that I am not one jot enamoured of their objections and reasonings, for
   all the new dress which, with some cost, our author hath been pleased
   to furnish them with, fashionably to set out themselves withal. Were it
   not for the confidence you express, in the close of your discourse, of
   your noble exploits and achievements in the consideration of this text
   (which magnificent thoughts of your undertaking and success I could not
   imagine from the reading of your arguments or exceptions, though on
   other accounts I might), I should not have thought it worth while to
   examine it particularly; which now, to safeguard the consolation of the
   weakest believers, and to encourage them to hold fast their confidence,
   so well established, against the assaults of all adversaries, Satan or
   Arminians, I shall briefly do:--

   1. Then, saith Mr Goodwin, "Evident it is, from the whole tenor of the
   chapter, that the words contain especial promises, made particularly to
   the Jews."

   Ans. If by particularly you mean exclusively, to them and not to
   others, this is evidently false; for the apostle tells you, Heb. viii.
   6, to the end of the chapter, that the covenant here mentioned is that
   whereof Christ is mediator, and the promise of it those better promises
   which they are made partakers of who have an interest in his mediation.

   2. He saith, "As evident it is, upon the same account, that the promise
   here mentioned was not made only to the saints or sound believers
   amongst the Jews, who were but few, but to the whole body or generality
   of them."

   Ans. True, it is as evident as what before you affirmed, and that in
   the same kind, -- that is, it is evidently false, or else the promise
   itself is so, for it was never fulfilled towards them all. But I refer
   you to a learned author, who hath long since assoiled this difficulty,
   and taught us to distinguish between a Jew en to phanero and a Jew en
   to krupto, of Israel according to "the flesh" and according to "the
   promise." He hath also taught us that "they are not all Israel that are
   of Israel," Rom. ii. 28, 29, ix. 6, 7. And upon that account it is that
   the word of this promise doth not fail, though all "of Israel" do not
   enjoy the fruit of it; -- not that it is conditional, but that it was
   not at all made unto them, as to the spiritual part of it, to whom it
   was not wholly fulfilled. And chap. xi. 7, he tells you that it was
   "the election" to whom these promises were made, and they obtained the
   fruit of them; neither doth that appendix of promises pointed to look
   any other way. When you have made good your observation by a reply to
   that learned author, we shall think of a rejoinder. It is therefore
   added, --

   3. "It is yet, upon the same account, as evident as either of the
   former that this promise was made unto this nation of the Jews when and
   whilst they were (or at least considered as now being) in the iron
   furnace of the Babylonian captivity, verse 23."

   Ans. That this solemn renovation of this promise of the covenant was
   not made to them when in Babylon, but given out to them beforehand, to
   sustain their hearts and spirits withal, in their bondage and thraldom,
   is granted. And what then, I pray? Is it any new thing to have
   spiritual promises solemnly given out and renewed upon the occasion of
   temporal distresses? A promise of Christ is given out to the house of
   David when in feat of being destroyed, Isa. vii. 13, 14; so it was
   given to Adam, Gen. iii. 15; so to Abraham, Gen. xvii.; so to the
   church, Isa. iv. 2-6. But farther it is said, --

   4. "From the words immediately preceding the passages offered to
   debate, it clearly appears that the promise in these passages relates
   unto and concerns their reduction and return from and out of that
   captivity into their own land."

   Ans. Will Mr Goodwin say that it doth only concern that? Dareth any man
   so boldly contradict the apostle, setting out from this very place the
   tenor of the covenant of grace, ratified in the blood of Christ? Heb.
   viii. 7-12. Nay, will any say that so much of the promise here as God
   calleth his covenant, chap. xxxi. 33, 34, xxxii. 38-40, doth at all
   concern their reduction into their own land any farther than it was a
   type or resemblance of our deliverance by Christ? These evident
   assertions ate as express and flat contradictions to the evident
   intendment of the Holy Ghost as any man is able to invent. But, --

   Mr Goodwin hath many deductions out of the former "sure and evident"
   premises, to prove that this is not a promise of absolute and final
   perseverance (it is a strange perseverance that is not final!) in grace
   to the end of their lives; for, saith he, --

   1. "The promise is made to the body of the people, and not to the
   saints and believers among them, and respects as well the unfaithful as
   the believers in that nation."

   Ans. It was made to "the body of the people" only typically considered,
   and so it was accomplished to the body of the people; spiritually and
   properly to the elect among the people, who, as the apostle tells us,
   obtained accordingly, there being also in the promise wrapped up the
   grace of effectual conversion. It may in some sense be said to be made
   to the "unfaithful," -- that is, to such as were so antecedently to the
   grace thereof, -- but not to any that abide so; for the promise is, not
   that they shall not, but that they shall believe, and continue in so
   doing to the end. But, saith he --

   2. "This promise was appropriated and fitted to the state of the Jews
   in a sad captivity; but the promise of perseverance was, if our
   adversaries might be believed, a standing promise among them, not
   appropriated to their condition."

   Ans. 1. "Non venit ex pharetris ista sagitta tuis." It is Socinus', in
   reference to Ezek. xxxvi., in Præl. Theol. cap. xii. sect. 6; and so is
   the whole interpretation of the place afterward insisted on derived to
   Mr Goodwin through the hands of the Remonstrants at the Hague
   conference. 2. If this exception against the testimony given in these
   words for the confirmation of the thesis in hand may be allowed, what
   will become of Mr Goodwin's argument from Ezek. xviii. for the apostasy
   of the saints? It is most certain the words from thence by him and
   others insisted on, with the whole discourse of whose contexture they
   are a part, are appropriated to a peculiar state of the Jews, and are
   brought forth as a meet vindication of the righteousness of God in his
   dealing with them in that condition. This, then, may be laid up in
   store to refresh Mr Goodwin with something of his own providing, when
   we are gone so far onward in our journey. But, 3. It is most evident to
   all the world that Mr Goodwin is not such a stranger in the Scriptures
   as not to have observed long since that spiritual promises are
   frequently given to the people of God to support their souls under
   temporal distresses; and that not always new promises for the matter of
   them (for indeed the substance of all promises is comprised in the
   first promise of Christ), but either such as enlarge and clear up grace
   formerly given or promised, or such as have need of a solemn renewal
   for the establishing of the faith, of the saints, assaulted in some
   particular manner in reference to them, which was the state of the
   saints among the Jews at this time. How often was the same promise
   renewed to Abraham! and upon what several occasions! and yet that
   promise, for the matter of it, was the same that had been given from
   the beginning of the world. That God's solemn renewal of the covenant
   at any time is called his making of or entering into covenant needs no
   labour to prove. But, saith he, --

   3. "This promise is the same with that of Ezek. xi. 17-20; which
   promise notwithstanding, it is said, verse 21, But as for them whose
   heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things, and their
   abominations, I will recompense their way upon their heads:' so that
   notwithstanding this seeming promise, as is pretended, of perseverance
   in grace, they may walk after their abominable things; for this
   threatening intends the same persons or nation (as Calvin himself
   confesseth), the Israelites."

   Ans. 1. Grant that this is the same promise with the other, how will it
   appear that this is not a promise of such an interposure of the Spirit
   and grace of God as shall infallibly produce the effect of
   perseverance? "Why, because some are threatened for following the heart
   of their abominable things." Yea, but how shall it appear that they are
   the same persons with them to whom the promise is made? The context is
   plainly against it. Saith He, "I will give them a heart to walk in my
   statutes and ordinances, to do them; but for them that walk after their
   own hearts, them I will destroy," in as clear a distinction of the
   object of the promise and threatening as is possible. Saith Mr Goodwin,
   "This threatening concerns the same persons or nation." The same
   nation, but not the same persons in that nation. "But Calvin saith that
   concerning the Israelites." But Paul hath told us that "they are not
   all Israel who are of Israel, not all children of the promise who are
   children of the flesh." And, --

   2. If it do any way concern the persons to whom that promise is given,
   it is an expression suited to the dispensation of God whereby he
   carrieth believers on in the enjoyment of the good things he gives them
   in and by his promises, without the least prediction of any event,
   being only declarative of what the Lord abhorreth, and of the
   connection that is between the antecedent and the consequent of the
   axiom wherein it is contained, and is far from the nature of those
   promises which hold out the purpose or intention of God, with the
   engaging of a real efficacy for their accomplishment. He adds, --

   4. "If this be a promise of absolute perseverance, no time nor season
   can be imagined wherein it was fulfilled."

   Ans. At all times and seasons to them to whom it was made, according to
   their concernment in it. But saith he, --

   (1.) "It hath been proved that it was made to the community of the
   Jewish nation, towards whom it was not fulfilled."

   Ans. (1.) It hath been said, indeed, again and again, but scarce once
   attempted to be proved, nor the reasoning of the apostle against some
   pretended proofs and answers to them at all removed. (2.) It was
   fulfilled to the body of that nation, as far as it concerned the body
   of that nation, in their typical return from their captivity. But then,
   --

   (2.) "If this be the sense, it was fulfilled in the captivity as well
   as afterward, for you say the saints always persevere."

   Ans. (1.) The typical part of it was not then accomplished. (2.) It is
   granted that as to the spiritual part of the covenant of grace, it was
   at all times fulfilled to them, which is now evidently promised to
   establish them in the assurance thereof. Wherefore it is, --

   5. Argued, sect. 53, (1.) "That these words, I will give them one
   heart, that they shall not depart from me,' may be as well rendered,
   That they may not depart from me;' and so it is said in the verse
   foregoing, That they may fear me for ever.'?"

   Ans. Suppose the words may be thus rendered, what inconvenience will
   ensue? Either way they evidently and beyond exception design out the
   end aimed at by God; and when God intends an end or event, so as to
   exert a real efficacy for the compassing of it, to say that it shall
   not be infallibly brought about is an assertion that many have not as
   yet had the boldness to venture on. But saith he, --

   (2.) "The words so read do not necessarily import the actual event or
   taking place of the effect intended of God in the promise, and his
   performance thereof, but only his intention itself in both these, and
   the sufficiency of the means allowed for producing such an effect: but
   it is of the same nature with that that our Saviour saith, John v. 34,
   These things I say unto you, that ye might be saved;' and that of God
   to Adam, Gen. iii. 10, 11." All which things were in like manner
   insisted on by the Remonstrants at the Hague colloquy.

   Ans. It is not amiss that our contests about the sense of this place of
   Scripture are at length come to the state and issue here expressed. It
   is granted the thing promised, and that according to the intendment of
   God, is perseverance; but that there is any necessity that this promise
   of God should be fulfilled or his intention accomplished, that is
   denied. Were it not that I should prevent myself in what will be more
   seasonable to be handled when we come to the consideration of the
   promises of God, I should very willingly engage here into the proof of
   this assertion. When God purposeth or intendeth an event, and promiseth
   to do it, to that end putting forth and exercising an efficient real
   power, it shall certainly be accomplished and brought to pass; neither
   can this be denied without casting the greatest reproach of mutability,
   impotency, and breach of word, upon the Most Holy, that is possible for
   any man to do. Neither do the Remonstrants nor Mr Goodwin acquit
   themselves from a participation in so high a crime by their instance of
   Gen. iii. 10, 11, where a command of God is only related to express his
   duty to whom it was given, not in the least asserting any intention of
   God about the event, or promise as to the means of its accomplishment.
   Nor doth that of John viii. 28 give them any more assistance in their
   sad undertaking to alleviate the truth of God. A means of salvation in
   its own nature and kind sufficient is exhibited, which asserts not an
   infallible necessity of event, as that doth which in this place is
   ascribed to God. But it is added, --

   6. Sect. 54, "The continuance of external and civil prosperity to the
   Jewish nation may much more colourably be argued from hence than the
   certainty of their perseverance in grace; for these things are most
   expressly promised, verses 39, 40, and yet we find that, upon their
   non-performance of the condition, they are become the most contemptible
   and miserable nation under heaven. Certainly, then, the spiritual
   promises here must also depend on conditions, which if not fulfilled,
   they also may come short of performance."

   Ans. 1. Rom. xi. 25-27. 2. These temporal promises were fulfilled unto
   them so far as they were made to them, -- that is, as they were
   typical, -- and what is behind of them shall be made good in due time.
   3. All these promises are, and were, in their chiefest and most eminent
   concernments (even the spiritual things set forth by allusions to the
   good land wherein they lived), completely and absolutely fulfilled to
   them, all and every one, to whom they were properly and directly made,
   as the apostle abundantly proveth, Rom. ix.-xi. 4. Whereas there are
   two special spiritual promises here expressed, one of conversion, the
   other of perseverance, I desire to know on what condition their
   accomplishment is suspended? On what condition will God write his law
   in their hearts? "On condition they hear him and obey him, suffer his
   mercies and kindnesses to work kindly on them." That is, on condition
   his law be in their hearts, he will write it there! Thanks yet for
   that! On what condition doth God promise that they shall abide with him
   for ever? "Why, on the condition they depart not from him." Very good!
   To what end doth God promise that which he will not effect, but only on
   condition that there is no need for him so to do! But, saith he, --

   7. "If the spiritual promises be absolute, so must the temporal be
   also; for their accomplishing depends solely on the things mentioned
   and promised in the spiritual."

   Ans. 1. Temporal things in the promises are often expressed only to be
   a resemblance, and to set off some eminent spiritual grace intended, as
   shall afterward appear. In that sense the promises mentioning such
   things are actually and fully accomplished in the collation of the
   spiritual things by them typed and resembled. 2. Temporal promises, as
   such, belong not primarily to the covenant of grace, as they are of
   temporal things for the substance of them, but to the covenant with
   that whole nation about their inheritance in the land of Canaan, which
   was expressly conditional, and which held out no more of God's
   intendment to that nation but only that there should be an inviolable
   connection between their obedience and prosperity. 3. The things in
   this promise are expressly differenced from the things of that covenant
   on this account, that that covenant being broken on the part of the
   nation, they enjoyed not that which was laid out as a fruit of their
   obedience; but this shall never be violated or broken, God undertaking
   for the accomplishing of it with another manner of engaging and
   suitable power exerted than in that of old, Heb. viii. 7-12, x. 16, 17.
   But, saith he, --

   8. "The expression of a covenant' plainly shows it to be conditional;
   for a covenant is not but upon the mutual stipulation parties; when one
   fails, then is the other true."

   Ans. 1. The word "berith" is sometimes used for a single promise
   without a condition, Gen. vi. 18, ix. 9; whence the apostle, handling
   this very promise, changeth the terms and calleth it a "testament." In
   a testamentary dispensation there is not in the nature of it any mutual
   stipulation required, but only a mere single favour and grant or
   concession. 2. It may be granted that here is a of duty from us, God
   promising to work that in us which he requires of us; and hereby is
   this covenant distinguished from that which was disannulled. In the
   good things, indeed, of this covenant, one may be the condition of
   another, but both are freely bestowed of God.

   And these are Mr Goodwin's exceptions against this testimony, which
   cometh in in the cause of God and his saints, that we have in hand. His
   next attempt is to give you the sense of the words on this
   consideration, to manifest from thence that this promise of God may
   come short of accomplishment.

   This, then, at length, is the account that is given in of the sense of
   the promise in hand, and all others of the like nature:--

   "?I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for
   ever, and will put my fear into their hearts, that they shall not,' or
   may not, depart from me;' that is, I will deal so above measure
   graciously and bountifully with them, as well in matters relating to
   their spiritual condition as in things concerning their outward
   condition, that if they be not prodigiously refractory, stubborn, and
   unthankful, I will overcome their evils with my goodness, and will
   cause them to own me for their God, and will reduce them as one man to
   a loving and loyal frame and temper of heart, that they shall
   willingly, with a free and full purpose of heart, fear and serve me for
   ever,'?" sect. 55.

   Ans. The first author of this gloss upon a parallel text was Socinus,
   Præl. Theol. cap. 6, whose words are: "This place of Ezekiel is well
   explained by Erasmus in his Diatribe, saying, That there is a usual
   figure of speaking contained in it, whereby a care in any of working
   something by another is signified, his endeavour being not excluded: as
   if a master should say to his scholar, speaking improperly, I will take
   away that barbarous tongue from thee, and give thee the Roman.' These
   are almost the words of Erasmus. To which add, that it appeareth from
   the place itself that God would not signify any necessity or any
   internal efficacy when he declareth that he will effect what he
   promiseth no other way than by the multitude of his benefits, wherewith
   he would affect the people and mollify their hearts and minds, and
   thereby, as it were, beget and create in them a willingness and
   alacrity in obeying of him." [113] The Remonstrants received this sense
   in the conference at the Hague, managing it in these words: "It is
   manifest that these words do signify some great efficacy and motion,
   which should come to pass by the many and excellent benefits of God,
   for whose sake they ought to convert themselves," etc.: which worthy
   interpretation being at length fallen upon Mr Goodwin's hand, is
   trimmed forth as you have heard. Secondly, Not to insist on those
   assumptions which are supposed in this interpretation, -- as, that this
   promise was made peculiarly to the Jews, and to the whole nation of
   them properly and directly, etc., -- the gloss itself will be found by
   no means to have the least consistency with either the words or
   intendment of the Holy Ghost in the place, nor to be suited to answer
   our argument from thence, nor yet to hold any good intelligence or
   correspondency with what hath already been delivered concerning it:
   for, --

   1. To begin with the latter, he affirms this cannot be a promise of
   absolute perseverance, "because if it be so, the Jews enjoyed it in
   that captivity as well as afterward, when that is here promised which
   they were not to receive until in and upon their return from Babylon,"
   sect. 52, pp. 220, 221. But if that which is here mentioned be all that
   is promised to them, -- namely, dealing so graciously and bountifully
   with them in his dispensations, according as was intimated, -- there is
   not any thing in the least held out to them in this place but what God
   had already (himself being judge) in as eminent and high a manner
   wrought in reference to them and for them as could be conceived; and
   indeed it was such as he never after this arose to that height of
   outward mercy and bounty in things spiritual and temporal so as before,
   Isa. v. 1, 2, 4. Neither after the captivity unto this day did they see
   again the triumphant glory of David, the magnificent peace of Solomon,
   the beauty of the temple, the perfection of ordinances, etc., as
   before.

   2. Whereas he affirmed formerly that "this promise is conditional, and
   that the things therein promised do depend on conditions by them to be
   fulfilled to whom the promise is made," sect. 54, p. 221, in the gloss
   here given us of the words there is no intimation of any such
   conditions as whereupon the promised actings of God should be
   suspended, but only an uncertainty of event in reference to these
   actings asserted. That (according to this interpretation) which alone
   God promiseth to do is, that "he would deal above measure graciously
   and bountifully with them, as well in matters relating to their
   spiritual condition as in things concerning their outward condition."
   This is all he promiseth; and this he will absolutely do, be the event
   what it will. It is not said (nor can it, with any pretence of reason)
   that this also is conditional; nay, whatever the event and issue be,
   that God will thus deal with them is the sense of the words in hand,
   according to the estimate here taken of them. It is true, it is in the
   exposition under consideration left doubtful and ambiguous whether such
   or such an event shall follow the promised actings of God or not; but
   what God promiseth concerning his dealing with them, that, without
   supposal of any condition whatever, shall be accomplished. According as
   a sense serves the turn, so it is to be embraced, when men are once
   engaged against the truth.

   3. Neither doth this interpretation so much as take notice of, much
   less doth it with any strength or evidence waive, our argument for the
   saints' perseverance from this place. We affirm, -- (1.) That the
   promise God made unto, or the covenant he makes here with, his people,
   is distinguished from or opposed unto the covenant that was broken,
   upon this account, that that was broken by the default of them with
   whom it was made, but God would take care and provide that this should
   not fail, but be everlasting, Jer. xxxi. 32, xxxii. 40; Heb. viii. 8,
   9. (2.) That the intendment of God in this promise, and' the
   administration of this covenant, with means and power mentioned
   therein, is the abiding of his saints with him, or rather, primarily
   and principally, his abiding with them, notwithstanding all such
   interveniences as he will not powerfully prevent from ever interposing
   to the disturbance of that communion he taketh them into. "I will,"
   saith he, "make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
   away from them, to do them good." Now, these things, and such like, are
   not once taken notice of in the exposition boasted to be full and
   clear.

   4. Neither, indeed, hath it any affinity unto or acquaintance in name
   or thing with the words or intendment of God, with the grace of the
   promise, or the promise itself; for, --

   (1.) God says he will "give them one heart and one way," or he will
   "put his law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;"
   which is plainly the work of his grace in them, and not the effect and
   fruit of his dealing with them. In the gloss in hand, the work of God
   is limited to such dealings with them as may "overcome them" to such a
   frame. The having of a new heart is either the immediate work of God,
   or it is their yielding unto their duty to him, upon his "dealing
   bountifully and graciously with them." If the first, it is what the
   Scripture affirms, and all that we desire; if the latter, how comes it
   to be expressed in terms holding out an immediate divine efficiency?
   That the taking away of a heart of stone, the giving of a new heart and
   spirit, the writing of the law in their hearts, and (which is all one)
   the quickening of the dead, the opening of blind eyes, the begetting of
   us anew, as they relate unto God, do signify no more but his
   administration of means, whereby men may be wrought upon and persuaded
   to bring their hearts and spirits into such a condition as is described
   in those expressions, to quicken themselves, to open their blind eyes,
   etc, Mr Goodwin shall scarce be able to evince.

   (2.) Conversion and pardon of sin being both in this promise of the
   covenant (I take in also that place of the same importance, chap. xxxi.
   33, 34), and relating alike to the grace of God, if conversion, or the
   giving of a new heart, be done only by administering outward means and
   persuasions unto men to make them new hearts, the forgiveness of sins
   must also be supposed to be tendered unto them upon the condition that
   their sins be forgiven, as conversion is on condition they be
   converted, or do convert themselves.

   (3.) This promise being by the prophet and apostle insisted on as
   containing the grace whereby, eminently and peculiarly, the new
   covenant is distinguished from that which was abolished, if the grace
   mentioned therein be only the laying a powerful and strong obligation
   on men to duty and obedience, upon the account of the gracious and
   bountiful dealing of God with them, both as to their temporal and
   spiritual condition, I desire to know wherein the difference of it from
   the old covenant, as to the collation of grace, doth consist, and
   whether ever God made a covenant with man wherein he did not put
   sufficient obligations of this kind upon him unto obedience; and if so,
   what are the "better promises" of the new covenant, and what eminent
   and singular things as to the bestowing of grace are in it; which
   things here are emphatically expressed to the uttermost.

   (4.) The scope of this exposition (which looks but to one part of the
   promise about bestowing of grace, overlooking the main end and
   intendment of it, as hath been showed) being to darken the words of the
   Holy Ghost, so far as to make them represent a contribution of means
   instead of an effectual working the end and the event, on which the
   means supplied have an influence of persuasion to prevail with men to
   do the things they are afforded them for, I desire to know, First, What
   new thing is here promised to them which exceeded that mentioned chap.
   xxv. 4, 5, wherein the Lord testifies that he had granted them formerly
   a large supply of outward means (and especially of the word) for the
   end here spoken of. Secondly, To what end and on what account is this
   administration of means for a work expressed by terms of a real
   efficiency in reference to the work itself; which, proceeding from the
   intendment of God for the event aimed at, must needs produce it. And,
   thirdly, Why these words should not be of the same importance with the
   associate expression, which of necessity must be interpreted of an
   actual and absolute efficiency, Jer. xxxii. 41, 42. And fourthly,
   Whether the administration of outward sufficient means for the
   producing of an event can be a ground of an infallible prediction of
   that event? as God here absolutely saith, "They shall all know me, from
   the least of them unto the greatest of them," chap. xxxi. 34; -- which
   how it is brought about, the Holy Ghost acquaints us, Isa. liv. 13,
   "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord;" and John vi. 45, "It is
   written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man
   therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto
   me." But Mr Goodwin hath sundry reasons to confirm his gloss, which
   must also be considered; and he saith, --

   1. "That it is the familiar dialect of Scripture to ascribe the doing
   of things or effects themselves to him that ministers occasions or
   proper and likely means for the doing of them. So God is said to give
   them one heart and one way, to put his fear into their hearts, when he
   administers motives, means, occasions, and opportunities to them, which
   are proper to work them to such a frame and disposition of heart, out
   of which men are wont to love and obey him, whether they be ever
   actually brought thereunto or no; and this promise was fulfilled to the
   people after their return out of captivity, in the mercies they enjoyed
   and the preaching of the prophets."

   Ans. We are not now to be informed that this is Mr Goodwin's doctrine
   concerning conversion, -- 1. That God doth only administer means,
   motives, and opportunities for it, but that man thereupon converts
   himself; and, 2. That when God hath done all he will or can, that the
   event may not follow, nor the work be wrought: but that this sense, by
   any means or opportunities, can be fastened on the promise under
   consideration, we are not as yet so well instructed. When God once
   intendeth an end, and expresseth himself so to do, promising to work
   really and efficiently for the accomplishing of it, yea, that he will
   actually do it, by that efficiency preventing all interpositions
   whatever that may tend to frustrate his design, that that end of his
   shall not be accomplished, or that that working of his is only an
   administration of means, whereby men may do the things intended if they
   will, or may do otherwise (he affirming that he will do them himself),
   is a doctrine beyond my reach and capacity. His saying that "in this
   sense the promise was fulfilled to the people after the captivity," is
   a swing against his own light. He hath told us not long since that it
   could not be a promise of those things which were enjoyed before it was
   ever given, as in our sense they did the grace of perseverance, etc.
   Surely the means he mentioneth (until at least the coming of Christ in
   the flesh) were advanced to a far higher pitch and eminency on all
   hands before the captivity than after; and at the coming of Christ it
   was eminently fulfilled, in our acceptation of it, unto all to whom it
   was made. But he adds, --

   2. "That if it be not so to be understood, and so said to be fulfilled
   as above, it is impossible for any one to assign how and when this
   promise was fulfilled; for, -- First, It was made to the whole people,
   and the fulfilling of it to a few will not confirm the truth of it.
   Secondly, The elect had no need of it, knowing themselves to be so, and
   that they should never fall away; so that this is but to make void the
   glorious promise of God. And, thirdly, To say that it was made to the
   elect is but to beg the thing in question."

   Ans. 1. As far as the body of the people was concerned in it, it was,
   and shall be in the latter days, absolutely accomplished towards them.
   It was, it is, and shall be, fulfilled to all to whom it was made, if
   so be that God be faithful and cannot deny himself. 2. It was, it is,
   and shall be, accomplished properly and directly to all the elect of
   that nation, to whom it was so made, as it hath been cleared already
   from Rom. ix.-xi., where the apostle, expressly and data opera, answers
   the very objection that Mr Goodwin makes about the accomplishing of
   these promises, concerning the hardening and rejection of the greatest
   part of that people, affirming it to consist in this, that the
   "election obtained when the rest were hardened;" wherein he did not beg
   the question, though he digged not for it, but answered by clear
   distinctions, as you may see, Rom. ix. 6, xi. 1, 2, 7. 3. Neither do
   all the elect after their calling know themselves to be so, nor have
   they any other way to become acquainted with their election but by
   their faith in the promises: nor is it spoken like one acquainted with
   the course and frame of God's dealing with his saints, or with their
   spirits in walking with God, who supposeth the solemn and clear
   renovation of promises concerning the same things, with explanations
   and enlargements of the grace of them, to confirm and establish the
   communion between the one and the other, to be needless. And who make
   the promises of God void and of no effect? -- we who profess the Lord
   to be faithful in every one of them, and that no one tittle of them
   shall fall to the ground or come short of accomplishment; or Mr
   Goodwin, who reports the grace mentioned in them, for the most part, to
   come short of producing the effect for which it is bestowed, and the
   engagements of God in them to depend so upon the lubricity of the wills
   of men, that mostly they are not made good in the end aimed at? The
   Lord will judge. But it is farther argued, --

   3. "That the Scripture many times asserts the futurity or coming to
   pass of things not yet in being, not only when the coming of them to
   pass is certainly known, but when it is probable, upon the account of
   the means used for the bringing them to pass; for God saith in the
   parable, They will reverence my Son,' Mark xii. 6, and yet the event
   was contrary. So upon the executing an offender, he saith, The people
   shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously;' which yet might
   not have its effect on all. So God saith, I will give them one heart;'
   not out of any certainty of knowledge or determination in himself that
   any such heart or way should actually be given them, which would
   infallibly produce the effect mentioned, but that he would grant such
   means as were proper to create such a heart in them."

   Ans. 1. The nearer the bottom the more sour the lees. First, Doth God
   foretell the coming to pass of things future upon a probable
   conjecture, which is here assigned to him? Is that the intendment of
   the expression in the parable, "They will reverence my Son." Or was he
   mistaken in the event, the thing falling out contrary to his
   expectation? Or is there any thing in this, or the place mentioned,
   Deut. xvii. 12, 13, but only an expression of the duty of men upon the
   account of the means offered? Is there any the least intimation of any
   intent and purpose of God as to the events insisted on? any promise of
   his effectual working for the accomplishing of them? any prediction
   upon the account of his purpose and design, which are the foundation of
   all his predictions? Or is there any the least correspondency in name
   or thing between the places now instanced in and called in for relief
   with that under consideration? This, then, is the sinew of Mr Goodwin's
   arguing in this place: "Sometimes when there are means offered men for
   the performance of a duty, the accomplishment of it is spoken of as of
   what ought to have succeeded; and it is the fault of men to whom that
   duty is prescribed and these means indulged if it come not to pass;
   therefore, when God purposeth and promiseth to work and bring about
   such and such a thing, and engageth himself to a real efficiency in it,
   yet it may come to pass or it may not, -- it may be accomplished, or
   God may fail in his intendment." 2. The sense here given to the promise
   of God, "I will give them one heart," etc., hath been formerly taken
   into consideration, and it hath been made to appear that,
   notwithstanding all the glorious expressions of God's administration of
   means to work men into the frame intimated, yet, upon the matter, the
   intendment of the exposition given amounts to this: "Though God saith
   he will give us a new heart, yet indeed he doth not so give it to any
   one in the world, nor ever intended to do so; but this new heart men
   must create, make, and work out themselves, upon the means afforded
   them, which, being very eminent, are said to create such hearts in
   them, though they do it not, but only persuade men thereunto." A
   comment this is not much unlike the first that ever was made upon the
   words of God, Gen. iii. 5! Whether God or man create the new heart is
   the matter here in question.

   For what he lastly affirms, "That if this be a promise of absolute
   perseverance, it is inconsistent with all the prophecies of the
   rejection of the Jews, which are accordingly fulfilled," I must refer
   him to St Paul, who hath long ago undertaken to answer this objection;
   from whom if he receive not satisfaction, what am I that I should hope
   to afford the least unto him?

   And these are the reasonings upon the account whereof Mr Goodwin
   dischargeth this text of Scripture, by virtue of his autocratorical
   power in deciding controversies of this nature, from bearing testimony
   in this cause any more. Whether he will be attended unto herein time
   will show. Many attempts to the same purpose have formerly been made,
   and yet it endureth the trial.

   I have thus turned aside to the consideration of the exceptions given
   in to the ordinary interpretation of this place, lest any should think
   that they were waived upon the account of their strength and efficacy
   to overthrow it. The argument I intended from the words, for the
   stability of God's love and favour to believers upon the account of his
   covenant engagement, is not once touched in any of them. These words,
   then, yield a third demonstration of the steadfastness and
   unchangeableness of acceptation of believers in Christ, upon the
   account of the absolute stability of that covenant of grace whereof
   God's engagement to be their God and never to forsake them is an
   eminent portion.

Chapter V. Argument from the promises of God.

   Entrance into the argument from the promises of God, with their
   stability and his faithfulness in them -- The usual exceptions to this
   argument -- A general description of gospel promises -- Why and on what
   account called gospel promises -- The description given general, not
   suited to any single promise -- They are free, and that they are so
   proved, all flowing from the first great promise of giving a Redeemer
   -- How they are discoveries of God's good-will; how made to sinners --
   Consequential promises made also to believers -- Given in and through
   Christ in a covenant of grace -- Their certainty upon the account of
   the engagement of the truth and faithfulness of God in them -- Of the
   main matter of these promises, Christ and the Spirit -- Of particular
   promises, all flowing from the same love and grace -- Observations on
   the promises of God, subservient to the end intended -- 1. They are all
   true and faithful; the ground of the assertion -- 2. Their
   accomplishment always certain, not always evident -- 3. All conditional
   promises made good, and how -- 4. The promises of perseverance of two
   sorts -- 5. All promises of our abiding with God in faith and obedience
   absolute -- The vanity of imposing conditions on them discovered -- 6.
   Promises of God's abiding with us not to be separated from promises of
   our abiding with him -- 7. That they do not properly depend on any
   condition in believers demonstrated -- Instances of this assertion
   given -- 8. Making them conditional renders them void as to the ends
   for which they are given -- Given to persons, not to qualifications --
   The argument from the promises of God stated -- Mr G.'s exceptions
   against the first proposition cleared, and his objections answered --
   The promises of God always fulfilled -- Of the promise made to Paul,
   Acts xxvii. 24, etc. -- Good men make good their promises to the utmost
   of their abilities -- The promise made to Paul absolute and of
   infallible accomplishment -- Of the promise of our Saviour to his
   disciples, Matt. xix. 28 -- Who intended in that promise; not Judas --
   The accomplishment of the promise -- The testimony of Peter Martyr
   considered -- The conclusion of the forementioned objection -- The
   engagement of the faithfulness of God for the accomplishment of his
   promise, 1 Cor. i. 9; 1 Thess. v. 23, 24; 2 Thess. iii. 3 -- The nature
   of the faithfulness of God, expressed in the foregoing places, inquired
   into -- Perverted by Mr G. -- His notion of the faithfulness of God
   weighed and rejected -- What intended in the Scripture by the
   faithfulness of God -- The close of the confirmation of the proposition
   or the argument proposed from the promises of God -- The assumption
   thereof vindicated -- The sense put upon it by Mr G. -- The question
   begged.

   The consideration of the promises of God, which are all branches of the
   forementioned root, all streaming from the fountain of the covenant of
   grace, is, according to the method proposed, in the next place
   incumbent on us. The argument for the truth under contest which from
   hence is afforded and used is by Mr Goodwin termed "The first-born of
   our strength," chap. xi. sect. 1, p. 225; and indeed we are content
   that it may be so accounted, desiring nothing more ancient, nothing
   more strong, effectual, and powerful, to stay our souls upon, than the
   promises of that God who cannot lie. [114] I shall, for the present,
   insist only on those which peculiarly assert, and in the name and
   authority of God confirm, that part of the truth we are peculiarly in
   demonstration of, -- namely, the unchangeable stability of the love and
   favour of God to believers, in regard whereof he turneth not from them
   nor forsaketh them upon the account of any such interveniences whatever
   as he will suffer to be interposed in their communion with him; leaving
   those wherein he gives assurance upon assurance that he will give out
   unto them such continual supplies of his Spirit and grace that they
   shall never depart from him to their due and proper place.

   I am not unacquainted with the usual exception that lieth against the
   demonstration of the truth in hand from the promises of God, to wit,
   that they are conditional, depending on some things in the persons
   themselves to whom they are made, upon whose change or alteration they
   also may be frustrated, and not receive their accomplishment. Whether
   this plea may be admitted against the particular promises that we shall
   insist upon will be put upon the trial, when we come to the particular
   handling of them. For the present, being resolved, by God's assistance,
   to pursue the demonstration proposed from them, it may not be amiss,
   yea, rather it may be very useful, to insist a little upon the promises
   themselves, their nature and excellency, that we may be the more
   stirred up to inquire after every truth and sweetness of the love,
   grace, and kindness (they being the peculiar way chosen of God for the
   manifestation of his good-will to sinners) that is in them; and I shall
   do it briefly, that I may proceed with the business of my present
   intendment.

   Gospel promises, then, are, -- 1. The free and gracious dispensations,
   and, 2. discoveries of God's good-will and love, to, 3. sinners, 4.
   through Christ, 5. in a covenant of grace; 6. wherein, upon his truth
   and faithfulness, he engageth himself to be their God, to give his Son
   unto them and for them, and his Holy Spirit to abide with them, with
   all things that are either required in them or are necessary for them
   to make them accepted before him, and to bring them to an enjoyment of
   him.

   I call them gospel promises, not as though they were only contained in
   the books of the New Testament, or given only by Christ after his
   coming in the flesh, -- for they were given from the beginning of the
   world, or first entrance of sin, [115] and the Lord made plentiful
   provision of them and by them for his people under the old testament,
   -- but only to distinguish them from the promises of the law, which
   hold out a word of truth and faithfulness, engaged for a reward of life
   to them that yield obedience thereunto (there being an indissolvable
   connection between entering into life and keeping the commandments),
   and so to manifest that they all belong to the gospel properly so
   called, or the tidings of that peace for sinners which was wrought out
   and manifested by Jesus Christ. [116]

   Farther; I do not give this for the description of any one single
   individual promise as it lieth in any place of Scripture, as though it
   expressly contained all the things mentioned herein (though virtually
   it doth so), but rather to show what is the design, aim, and goodwill
   of God in them all; which he discovers and manifests in them by several
   parcels, according as they may be suited to the advancement of his
   glow, in reference to the persons to whom they are made. If port the
   matter, all the promises of the gospel are but one, and every one of
   them comprehends and tenders the same love, the same Christ, the same
   Spirit, which are in them all. None can have an interest in any one but
   he hath an interest in the good of them all, that being only
   represented variously for the advantage of them that believe. My design
   is to describe the general intention of God in all gospel promises,
   whereby they, being equally spirited, become as one. [117] And
   concerning these, I say, --

   1. That they are free and gracious as to the rise and fountain of them.
   They are given unto us merely through the good-will and pleasure of
   God. [118] That which is of promise is everywhere opposed to that which
   is of doubt, or that which is any way deserved or procured by us: Gal.
   iii. 18, "If the inheritance be of the law" (which includes all that in
   us is desirable, acceptable, and deserving), "it is no more of
   promise," -- that is, free, and of mere grace. He that can find out any
   reason or cause without God himself why he should promise any good
   thing whatever to sinners (as all are, and are shut up under sin, till
   the promise come, Gal. iii. 22), may be allowed to glory in the
   invention which he hath found out, Matt. xx. 15. A well-conditioned
   nature, necessitating him to a velleity of doing good, and yielding
   relief to them that are in misery (though justly receiving the due
   reward of their deeds, which even among the sons of men is a virtue
   dwelling upon the confines of vice), for their recovery, is by some
   imposed on him. But that this is not the fountain and rise of his
   promises needs no other evidence but the light of this consideration:
   That which is natural is necessary and universal; promises are
   distinguishing as to them in misery, at least they are given to men,
   and not to fallen angels But may not God do what he will with his own?

   Farther; Jesus Christ is himself in the promise. He is the great
   original, matter, and subject of the promises, and the giving of him
   was doubtless of free grace and mercy: so John iii. 16, "God so loved
   the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son;" and Rom. v. 8, "God
   commendeth his love toward us, in that, whilst we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for us;" and in 1 John iv. 10, "Herein is love, not that we
   loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins," All is laid upon the account of love and
   free grace, Matt. xi. 26. I confess there are following promises given
   out for the orderly carrying on of the persons to whom the main,
   original, fundamental promises are made, unto the end designed for
   them, that seem to have qualifications and conditions in them; but yet
   even those are all to be resolved into the primitive grant of mercy.
   That which promiseth life upon believing, -- being of use to stir men
   up unto and carry them on in faith and obedience, -- must yet, as to
   the pure nature of the promise, be resolved into that which freely is
   promised, namely, Christ himself, and with him both faith and life,
   believing and salvation. As in your automata there is one original
   spring or wheel that giveth motion to sundry lesser and subordinate
   movers, that are carried on with great variety, sometimes with a
   seeming contrariety one to another, but all regularly answering and
   being subservient to the impression of the first mover; [so] the first
   great promise of Christ, and all good things in him, is that which
   spirits and principles all other promises whatsoever; [119] and
   howsoever they may seem to move upon conditional terms, yet they are
   all to he resolved into that absolute and free original spring. Hence
   that great grant of gospel mercy is called "The gift by him," Rom. v.
   15-18; yea, all the promises of the law, as to their original emanation
   from God, and the constitution of the reward in them, engaged to be
   bestowed for the services required, are free and gracious; there is not
   any natural, indispensable connection between obedience and reward, as
   there is between sin and punishment, as I have elsewhere at large
   disputed and proved. [120]

   2. I call them discoveries and manifestations of God's good-will and
   love, which is the prime and sole cause of all the good things which
   are wrapped up and contained in them. Of this good-will of God, the
   promises which he hath given are the sole discoveries. We do not in
   this discourse take "promises" merely for what God hath said he will do
   in terms expressly, but for every assertion of his good-will and
   kindness to us in Christ; all which was first held out under a word of
   promise, Gen. iii. 15. And this the apostle infers in Titus i. 2, 3,
   "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before
   the world began, but hath in due times manifested his word through
   preaching," or discovered or made known that goodwill of his by the
   promises in preaching of the gospel. And to this extent of significancy
   is that "promise" in the Scripture, both name and thing, in very many
   places stretched out. Every thing whatever that is manifestative of
   grace and good-will to sinners is of the promise, though it be not cast
   into a promissory form of expression. Yea, whereas, strictly, a promise
   respecteth that which is either only future, and not of present
   existence, or the continuance of that which is, yet even expressions of
   things formerly done and of a present performance (some individuals to
   the end of the world being to be made anew partakers of the grace,
   good-will, and mercy in them) do belong to the promise also, in that
   acceptation of it which the Holy Ghost in many places leads unto, [121]
   and which we now insist upon.

   3. I say they are made unto sinners, and that as sinners, under no
   other qualification whatever, it being by the mercy of the promise
   alone that any men are relieved out of that condition of being sinners,
   and morally nothing else. Were not the promises originally made to
   sinners, there would never any one be found in any other state or
   condition. [122] I know there are promises made to believers, even such
   as are unchangeable, and shall bear them into the bosom of God; but I
   say these are all consequential, and upon supposition of the first and
   great promise, whereby Christ himself, and faith for his sake, are
   bestowed on them. This runs through them all, as the very tenor of them
   and method of God in them do manifest, [123] as we shall see afterward.
   So the apostle, Gal. iii. 22, "The Scripture hath concluded all under
   sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them
   that believe." All are shut up under sin until the promise of salvation
   by Jesus Christ and faith in him cometh in for their deliverance. The
   promise is given to them as shut up under sin, which they receive by
   mixing it with faith. And Rom. iii. 23, 24, "All have sinned, and come
   short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace, through
   the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." Their condition is a condition
   of sin and falling short of the glory of God, when the promise for
   justification is given unto them and finds them. Thence the Lord tells
   us, Isa. liv. 8, 9, that this promise of mercy is like that which he
   made about the waters of Noah, where is mentioned no condition at all
   of it, but only the sins of men. [124] And in that state unquestionably
   was Adam when the first promise was given unto him. To say, then, that
   gospel promises are made to men in such conditions, and are to be made
   good only upon the account of men's abiding in the condition wherein
   they are when the promise is made to them, is to say, that for men to
   leave the state of sin is the way to frustrate all the promises of God.
   All deliverance from a state of sin is by grace; [125] all grace is of
   promise. Under that condition, then, of sin doth the promise find men,
   and from thence relieve them.

   4. I say, these discoveries of God's good-will are made through Christ,
   as the only medium of their accomplishment, and only procuring cause
   of, the good things that, flowing from the good-will of God, are
   inwrapped and tendered in them, 2 Cor. i. 20. And they are said to be
   in Christ, as, -- (1.) The great messenger of the covenant, as in him
   who comes from the Father, because God hath confirmed and ratified them
   all in him; not in themselves, but unto us. He hath in him and by him
   given faith and assurance of them all unto us, declaring and confirming
   his good-will and love to us by him. He reveals the Father (as a
   father) from his own bosom, John i. 18, declaring his name or grace
   unto his, chap. xvii. 3. "All the promises of God in him are yea, and
   in him amen, to the glory of God by us," 2 Cor. i. 20. In him, and by
   his mediation, they have all their confirmation, establishment, and
   unchangeableness unto us. (2.) Because he hath undertaken to be surety
   of that covenant whereof they are the promises: Heb. vii. 22, he is
   "the surety" of the covenant; that is, one who hath undertaken, both on
   the part of God and on ours, whatever is needful for confirmation
   thereof. And, (3.) Because that himself is the great subject of all
   these promises, and in him (it being of his own purchase and procuring,
   he "having obtained eternal redemption for us," Heb. ix. 12) there is
   treasured up all the fullness of those mercies which in them God hath
   graciously engaged himself to bestow, they being all annexed to him, as
   the portion he brings with him to the soul. [126] Then, I say, --

   5. That they are discoveries of God's good-will in a covenant of grace.
   They are, indeed, the branches, streams, and manifesting conveyances,
   of the grace of that covenant, and of the good-will of God putting
   itself forth therein. Hence the apostle mentions the "covenants of
   promise," Eph. ii. 12, either for the promises of the covenant or its
   manifestation, as I said before. Indeed, as to the subject-matter and
   eminently, the promise is but one, as the covenant is no more; but both
   come under a plural expression, because they have been variously
   delivered and renewed upon several occasions. So the covenant of grace
   is said to be established upon these promises, Heb. viii. 6; that is,
   the grace and mercy of the covenant, and the usefulness of it to the
   ends of a covenant, to keep God and man together in peace and
   agreement, are laid upon these promises, to be by them confirmed and
   established unto us, God having by them revealed his good-will unto us,
   with an attendancy of stipulation of duty. Their use, for the begetting
   and continuing communion between God and us, with the concomitancy of
   precepts, places them in the capacity of a covenant. And then, --

   6. I mentioned the foundation of the certainty and unchangeableness of
   these promises, with our assurance of their accomplishment. The
   engagements and undertakings of God, upon his truth and faithfulness,
   are the stock and unmovable foundation of this respect of them.
   Therefore, speaking of them, the Holy Ghost often backs them with that
   property of God, "He cannot lie:" so Heb. vi. 17, 18, "God, willing
   more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of
   his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in
   which it was impossible for God to lie," etc.; so Titus i. 2, "God,
   which cannot lie, hath promised us eternal life." There is no one makes
   a solemn promise, but as it ought to proceed from him in sincerity and
   truth, so he engageth his truth and faithfulness, in all the credit of
   them, for the accomplishment thereof what lieth in him; and on this
   account doth David so often appeal unto and call upon the righteousness
   of God as to the fulfilling of his promises and the word which he
   caused him to put his trust in. [127] It is because of his engagement
   of his truth and faithfulness, whence it becometh a righteous thing
   with him to perform what he hath spoken. How far this respect of the
   promises extends, and wherein it is capable of a dispensation, is the
   sum of our present controversy. But of this afterward. Then, --

   7. A brief description of the matter of these promises, and what God
   freely engageth himself unto in them, was insisted on. Of this, of the
   promises in this regard, there is one main fountain or spring, whereof
   there are two everlasting streams, whence thousands of refreshing
   rivulets do flow. The original fountain and spring of all good unto us,
   both in respect of its being and manifestation, is that he will be our
   God: Gen. xvii. 1, 2, "I am the Almighty God; walk before me and be
   thou perfect: and I will make my covenant," etc. So everywhere, as the
   bottom of his dealing with us in covenant: Jer. xxxi. 33, "I will be
   their God, and they shall be my people;" Isa. liv. 5; Hos. ii. 23; and
   in very many other places. Now, that he may thus be our God, two things
   are required:--

   (1.) That all breaches and differences between him and us be removed,
   perfect peace and agreement made, and we rendered acceptable and
   well-pleasing in his sight. These are the terms whereon they stand to
   whom he is a God in covenant. For the accomplishment of this is the
   first main stream that floweth from the former fountain, -- namely, the
   great promise of giving Christ to us and for us, "who is our peace,"
   Eph. ii. 14; and "who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,
   and sanctification, and redemption," 1 Cor. i. 30; "who loves us, and
   washeth us in his own blood, and makes us kings and priests to God and
   his Father," Rev. i. 5, 6; "giving himself for his church, that he
   might sanctify and cleanse it, with the washing of water by the word,
   that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot,
   or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without
   blemish," Eph. v. 25-27; [128] doing and accomplishing all things that
   are required for the forementioned ends. And this is the first main
   stream that flows from that fountain. Christ as a redeemer, a saviour,
   a mighty one, a priest, a sacrifice, an oblation, our peace,
   righteousness, and the author of our salvation, is the subject-matter
   thereof.

   (2.) That we may be kept and preserved meet for communion with him as
   our God, and for the enjoyment of him as our reward. For this end flows
   forth the other great stream from the former fountain, -- namely, the
   promise of the Holy Spirit; which he gives us to "make us meet for the
   inheritance of the saints in light," [129] to put forth and exercise
   towards us all the acts of his love which are needful for us, and to
   work in us the obedience which he requires and accepts of us in Jesus
   Christ, so preserving us for himself. This promise of the Spirit in the
   covenant, with his work and peculiar dispensations, is plentifully
   witnessed in very many places of the Old Testament and New, [130] some
   whereof must afterward be insisted on. Hence he is sometimes called the
   promise of the covenant: Acts ii. 39, "The promise is to you;" which
   promise is that which Christ receiveth from his Father, verse 33, even
   "the promise of the Holy Ghost." I shall only add, that though this be
   a great stream flowing from the first fountain, yet it comes not
   immediately thence, but issues out from the stream before mentioned,
   the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ; for he is given by him unto us,
   as procured for us, and given only unto his, John xiv. 16, 17, 26; Gal.
   iv. 6.

   Now, from these two grand streams do a thousand rivulets flow forth for
   our refreshment. All the mercy that Christ hath purchased, all the
   graces that the Spirit doth bring forth (which in the former
   description I call all things that are either required in them or
   needful to them to make them accepted before God, and to bring them to
   an enjoyment of him), all promises of mercy and forgiveness, all
   promises of faith and holiness, of obedience and perseverance, of joy
   and consolation, of correction, affliction, and deliverance, -- they
   all flow from these; that is, from the matter of those promises doth
   the matter of these arise. And hence are the ensuing corollaries:--

   1. Whoever hath an interest in any one promise hath an interest in them
   all, and in the fountain-love from whence they flow. He to whom any
   drop of their sweetness floweth may follow it up unto the spring. Were
   we wise, each taste of mercy would lead us to the ocean of love. Have
   we any hold on a promise? -- we may get upon it, and it will bring us
   to the main, Christ himself and the Spirit, and so into the bosom of
   the Father. It is our folly to abide upon a little, which is given us
   merely to make us press for more.

   2. That the most conditional promises are to be resolved into absolute
   and unconditional love. God, who hath promised life upon believing,
   hath promised believing on no condition (on our parts) at all, because
   to sinners.

   This in general being given in concerning the nature of the promises, I
   shall proceed to some such considerations as are of particular
   usefulness unto that improvement which, the Lord assisting, I intend to
   make of them, for the confirmation of the truth under debate. And they
   are these:--

   1. All the promises of God are true and faithful, and shall most
   certainly all of them be accomplished. His nature, his veracity, his
   unchangeableness, his omniscience and omnipotency, do all contribute
   strength to this assertion. Neither can these properties possibly
   continue entire, and the honour of them he preserved unto the Lord, if
   the least failing in the accomplishment of his promises be ascribed
   unto him. Every such failing must of necessity relate to some such
   principle as stands in direct opposition to one or more of the
   perfections before mentioned. It must be a failing in the truth,
   unchangeableness, prescience, or power, that must frustrate the promise
   of any one. We, indeed, often alter our resolutions, and the promise
   that is gone out of our mouths, and that perhaps righteously, upon some
   such change of things as we could not foresee, nor ought to have
   supposed, when we entered into our engagements. No such thing can be
   ascribed unto Him who knows all things, with their circumstances, that
   can possibly come to pass, and hath determined what shall so do, and
   therefore will not engage in any promise that he knows something which
   he foresaw would follow after would cause him to alter. It were a
   ludicrous thing in any son of man to make a solemn promise of any thing
   to another, if he particularly knew that in an hour some such thing
   would happen as should enforce him to change and alter that promise
   which he had so solemnly entered into. And shall we ascribe such an
   action to Him before whom all things are open and naked? Shall he be
   thought solemnly to engage himself to do or accomplish any thing which
   yet not only he will not do, but also at that instant hath those things
   in his eye and under his consideration for which he will not so do as
   he promiseth, and determined before that he would not so do? If this be
   not unworthy the infinite goodness, wisdom, and faithfulness of God, I
   know not what can or may be ascribed unto him that is. Yea, the truth
   and veracity of God in his promises cannot be denied him without
   denying him his deity, or asserted without the certain accomplishment
   of what he hath promised.

   2. There are sundry things relating to the accomplishment of promises,
   as to times, seasons, persons, ways, etc., wherein we have been in the
   dark, and yet the promises concerning them be fully accomplished. The
   rejection of the Jews supplies us with an instance pregnant with this
   objection. The apostle tells us that with many this objection did arise
   on that account: "If the Jews be rejected, then the promises of God to
   them do fail," Rom. iii. 3. He lays down and answers this objection,
   discovering that fallacy therein by a distinction. "They are not,"
   saith he, "all Israel which are of Israel," chap. ix. 6; as if he had
   said, "There is a twofold Israel, an Israel after the flesh only, and
   an Israel after the flesh and Spirit also." Unto these latter were the
   promises made; and therefore they who look on the former only think it
   faileth, whereas indeed it holdeth to its full accomplishment. So he
   disputes again, chap. xi. 7. I say, then, we may be in the dark as to
   many circumstances of the fulfilling of promises, when yet they have
   received a most exact accomplishment.

   3. All the conditional promises of God are exactly true, and shall be
   most faithfully made good by accomplishment as to that wherein their
   being as promises doth consist, as far as they are declarative of God's
   purpose and intendment. This is that which, as I said before, some
   object, "Many of the promises of God are conditional, and their truth
   must needs depend upon the accomplishment of the condition mentioned in
   them; if that be not fulfilled, then they also must fail, and be of
   none effect." I say, then, that even the conditional promises of God
   are absolutely made good. The truth of any promise consists in this,
   that that whereof it speaks answers the affirmation itself. For
   instance, "He that believeth shall be saved." This promise doth not
   primarily affirm that any one shall be saved, and notwithstanding it no
   one might so be; but only this it affirms, that there is an infallible
   connection between faith and salvation, and therein is the promise most
   true, whether any one believe or no. Briefly, conditional promises are
   either simply declarative of the will of God in fixing an exact
   correspondency between a condition mentioned and required in them and
   the thing promised by them, in which case they have an unchangeable and
   infallible verity in themselves, as there is in all the promises of the
   moral law to this day, for he that keeps the commandments shall live;
   or they are also the discoveries of the good-will of God, his
   intendments and purposes, that whereof they make mention being not the
   condition whereon his purposes are suspended, but the way and means
   whereby the thing promised is to be accomplished; and in the latter
   acceptation alone are they, in the business in hand, our concernment.

   4. That the promises concerning perseverance (as hath been often
   intimated) are of two sorts; -- the first, of the continuance of the
   favour of God to us, which respects our justification; the other, of
   the continuance of our obedience unto God, which respects our
   sanctification. Let us consider both of them, and begin with the
   latter:--

   (1.) Of them I say, then, they are all absolute, not one of them
   conditional (so as to be suspended as to their accomplishment on any
   conditions), nor can be. The truth of God in them hath not its
   efficiency and accomplishment by establishing the relation that is
   between one thing and another, or the connection that is between duty
   and reward, as it is in conditional promises that are purely and merely
   so; but enforceth the exact fulfilling of the thing promised, and that
   with respect unto, and for the preservation of, the glory of that
   excellency of God, "He cannot lie." Let it be considered what that
   condition or those conditions be, or may be, on which promises of this
   nature should be suspended, and the truth of the former assertion will
   evidently appear. That God hath promised unto believers that they shall
   for ever abide with him in the obedience of the covenant unto the end
   shall afterward be proved by a cloud of witnesses. What, now, is the
   condition whereon this promise doth depend? "It is," says Mr Goodwin,
   "that they perform their duty, that they suffer not themselves to be
   seduced, nor willingly cast off the yoke of Christ." But what doth this
   amount unto? Is it not thus much: If they abide with God (for if they
   perform their duty, and do not suffer themselves to be seduced, nor
   willingly depart from God, they abide with him), God hath promised that
   they shall abide with him, -- upon condition they abide with him, he
   hath promised they shall? "Egregiam vero laudem!" Can any thing more
   ridiculous be invented? If men abide with God, what need they any
   promise that they shall so do? The whole virtue of the promise depends
   on that condition, and that condition containeth all that is promised.
   Neither is it possible that any thing can be invented to be supplied as
   the condition or conditions of these promises, but it will quickly
   appear, upon consideration, that however it may be differently phrased,
   yet indeed it is coincident with the matter of the promise itself. That
   condition or those conditions must consist in some act, acts, way, or
   course of acceptable obedience in them to whom the promises are made.
   This the nature of the thing itself requireth. Now, every such act,
   way, or course, is the matter of the promise, even universal obedience.
   Now, if one man should promise another that he should, at such a time
   and place, be supplied with a hundred pounds to pay his debts, on
   condition that he came and brought the money himself, ought he to be
   esteemed to have a mind to relieve the poor man, or to mock him? To
   affirm that when God promiseth to write his law in our hearts, to put
   his fear in our inward parts, to create in us a new heart, to
   circumcise our hearts that we may fear him always, to give us his
   Spirit to abide with us for ever, to preserve us by his power, so that
   we shall never leave him nor forsake him, shall live to him, and sin
   shall not have dominion over us, etc., he doth it upon condition that
   we write his law in our hearts, circumcise them, continue to fear him,
   abide with him, not forsake him, etc., is to make him to mock and
   deride at their misery whose relief he so seriously pretendeth.
   Whatever promises, then, of this kind (promises of working obedience in
   us, for our abiding with him) shall be produced, they will be found to
   be absolute and independent on any condition whatever, and their truth
   no ways to be maintained but in and by their accomplishment.

   (2.) For those of the first sort, which I shall now handle, farther to
   clear the foundation of their ensuing application, I shall propose only
   some few things unto consideration; as, --

   [1.] That they are not to be taken or looked upon, as to their use for
   argument in the present controversy, separated and divided from those
   other promises formerly insisted on, which assure believers that they
   shall always abide with God as to their obedience. All hope that any
   have to prevail against them is by dividing of them. It is a very vain
   supposal and foundation of sand which our adversaries build their
   inferences upon, which they make against the doctrine of the saints'
   perseverance, -- namely, the impossibility that God should continue his
   love and favour to them whilst they wallow in all manner of
   abominations and desperate rebellions against him; a hypothesis crudely
   imposed on our doctrine, and repeated over and over as a matter of the
   greatest detestation and abomination that can fall within the thoughts
   of men. And such supposals and conclusions are made thereupon as
   border, at least, upon the cursed coast of blasphemy. But cui fini, I
   pray, to what end, is all this noise? as though any had ever asserted
   that God promised to continue his love and gracious acceptation always
   to his saints, and yet took no care nor had promised that they should
   be continued saints, but would suffer them to turn very devils. It is
   as easy for men to confute hypotheses created in their own imaginations
   as to cast down men of straw of their own framing and setting up. We
   say, indeed, that God hath faithfully promised that he will never leave
   nor forsake believers; but withal that he hath no less faithfully
   engaged himself that they shall never wickedly depart from him, but
   that they shall continue saints and believers. Yea (if I may so say),
   promising always to accept them freely, it is incumbent on his holy
   Majesty, upon the account of his truth, faithfulness, and
   righteousness, to preserve them such as, without the least dishonour to
   his grace and holiness, yea, to the greatest advantage of his glory, he
   may always accept them, delight in them, and rejoice over them; and so
   he tells us he doth, Jer. xxxi. 3, "Yea, I have loved thee with an
   everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee." He
   draws us with kindness to follow him, obey him, live unto him, abide
   with him, because he loves us with an everlasting love.

   [2.] That these promises of God do not properly, and as to their
   original rise, depend on any conditions in believers, or by them to be
   fulfilled, but are the fountains and springs of all conditions whatever
   that are required to be in them or expected from them, though the grace
   and obedience of believers are often mentioned in them as the means
   whereby they are carried on, according to the appointment of God, unto
   the enjoyment of what is promised or continued in it. This one
   consideration, that there is in very many of these promises an express
   non obstante, or a notwithstanding the want of any such condition as
   might seem to be at the bottom and to be the occasion of any such
   promise or engagement of the grace of God, is sufficient to give light
   and evidence to this assertion. If the Lord saith expressly that he
   will do so with men, though it be not so with them, his doing of that
   thing cannot depend on any such thing in them, as he saith
   notwithstanding the want of it he will do it Take one instance: Isa.
   liv. 8-10, "In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but
   with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy
   Redeemer. For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have
   sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have
   I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For the
   mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall
   not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be
   removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee." He will have mercy on
   them with everlasting kindness, verse 8. "Yea, but how if they walk not
   worthy of it?" Why, yet this kindness shall not fail, saith the Lord;
   for it is "as the waters of Noah." God sweareth that "the waters of
   Noah shall no more cover the earth," and you see the stability of what
   he hath spoken; the world is now "reserved for fire," but drowned it
   shall be no more. "My kindness to thee," says God, "is such, it shall
   no more depart from thee than those waters shall return again upon the
   earth." Neither is this all wherein he compareth his kindness to the
   waters of Noah, but in this also, in that in the promise of drowning
   the world no more there was an express non obstante for the sins of
   men: Gen. viii. 21, "The Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse
   the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart
   is evil from his youth." "Though men grow full of wickedness and
   violence, as before the flood they were, yet," saith the Lord, "the
   world shall be drowned no more." And in this doth the promise of
   kindness hold proportion with that of the waters of Noah. There is an
   express relief in it against the sins and failings of them to whom it
   is made, -- namely, such as he will permit them to fall into, whilst he
   certainly preserves them from all such as are inconsistent with his
   love and favour, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace; and
   therefore it depends not on any thing in them, being made with a
   proviso for any such defect as in them may be imagined.

   [3.] To affirm that these promises of God's abiding with us to the end
   do depend on any condition that may be uncertain in its event, by us to
   be fulfilled, as to their accomplishment, doth wholly enervate and make
   them void in respect to the main end for which they were given us of
   God. That one chief end of them is to give the saints consolation in
   every condition, in all the straits, trials, and temptations, which
   they are to undergo or may be called to, is evident. When Joshua was
   entering upon the great work of subduing the Canaanites, and setting
   the tabernacle and people of God in their appointed inheritance,
   wherein he was to pass through innumerable difficulties, trials, and
   pressures, God gives him that word of promise, "I will not fail thee,
   nor forsake thee," Josh. i. 5. So are many of them made to the saints
   in their weakness, darkness, and desertions, as will appear by the
   consideration of the particular instances following, Isa. iv. 3, 4.
   Now, what one drop of consolation can a poor, drooping, tempted soul,
   squeeze out of such promises as depend wholly and solely upon any thing
   within themselves: "He will be with me and be my God, it is true; but
   always provided that I continue to be his. That also is a sweet and
   gracious promise; but that I shall do so he hath not promised. It seems
   I have a cursed liberty left me of departing wickedly from him; so
   that, upon the matter, notwithstanding these promises of his, I am left
   to myself. If I will abide with him, well and good, he will abide with
   me, and so it will be well with me; -- that he should so abide with me
   as to cause me to abide with him, it seems there is no such thing.
   Soul, look to thyself; all thy hopes and help are in thyself. But,
   alas! for the present I have no sense of this love of God, and I know
   not that I have any true, real, unfeigned obedience to him. Corruption
   is strong, temptations are many; what shall I say? Shall I exercise
   faith on those promises of God wherein he hath said and given assurance
   that he will be a God to me for ever?' According as my thoughts are of
   my own abiding with him, so may I think of them, and no otherwise; so
   that I am again rolled upon mine own hands, and left to mine own
   endeavours to extricate myself from these sad entanglements." What now
   becomes of the consolation which in these promises is intended? Are
   they not, on this account, rather flints and pieces of iron than
   breasts of comfort and joy?

   Lastly, If it be so as is supposed, it is evident that God makes no
   promises unto persons, but only unto conditions and qualifications; --
   that is, his promises are not engagements of his love and goodwill to
   believers, but discoveries of his approbation of believing. Suppose any
   promise of God to be our God, our all-sufficient God for ever, not
   eminently to include an engagement for the effectual exertion of the
   all-sufficiency to preserve and continue us in such a state and
   spiritual condition as wherein he may with the glory and honour of his
   grace, and will not fail to, abide and continue our God, and you cut
   all the nerves and sinews of it, as to the administration of any
   consolation unto them to whom it is given. The promises must be made
   good, that is certain; and if they are accomplished or not accomplished
   unto men merely upon the account of such and such qualifications in
   them, -- which if they are found, then they shall be fulfilled, if not,
   then they are suspended, -- they are made to the conditions, and not at
   all to the persons. And though some, perhaps, will easily grant this,
   yet upon this account it cannot be said that God ever made any one
   promise unto his church as consisting of such persons, namely, Abraham
   and his seed; which is directly contrary to that of the apostle, Rom.
   ix. 8, where he calleth the elect "The children of the promise," or
   those to whom the promises were made. It appears, then, that neither
   are these promises of God conditional. As they proceed from free grace,
   so there is no other account on which they are given out, continued,
   and accomplished, towards the children of God. Though the things of the
   promise are often placed in dependence one on another, as means and
   ends, yet the promises themselves are absolute.

   These few things being premised, I shall now name and insist upon some
   particular promises, wherein the Lord hath graciously engaged himself
   that he will abide to be a God in covenant unto his people and their
   guide unto death; from which I shall labour to make good this argument
   for the perseverance of the saints:-- "That which that God, who cannot
   lie' nor deceive,' with whom there is no variableness, neither shadow
   of turning,' [131] who is faithful' in all his promises, and all whose
   words are faithfulness and truth,' hath solemnly promised and engaged
   himself unto, to this end, that they unto whom he so promiseth and
   engageth himself may from those promises receive strong consolation,'
   -- that he will certainly perform and accomplish. That he will be a God
   and a guide unto death unto his saints, that he will never leave them
   nor forsake them, that he will never cast them off nor leave them out
   of his favour, but will preserve them such as is meet for his holy
   majesty to embrace, love, and delight in, and that with an express
   notwithstanding for every such thing as might seem to provoke him to
   forsake them, he hath promised, and for the end mentioned; therefore,
   [the promise] that he will so abide with them, that his love shall be
   continued to them to the end, that he will preserve them unto himself,
   etc., according to his truth and faithfulness, shall be accomplished
   and fulfilled." The inference hath its strength from the nature, truth,
   and faithfulness of God; and whilst they abide in any credit with the
   sons of men, it may seem strange that it should be denied or
   questioned. The major proposition of the forementioned argument is
   examined by Mr Goodwin, chap. xi. sect 1, p. 225. Saith he, --

   1. "What God hath promised in his word is certain in such a sense and
   upon such terms as God would be understood in his promises; but what he
   promised in one sense is not certain of performance in the other."

   Ans. Doubtless, God's meaning and intention in his promises is the rule
   of their accomplishment. This sometimes we may not be able to fathom,
   and thereupon be exposed to temptations not a few concerning their
   fulfilling; so was it with them with whom Paul had to do in reference
   to the promises made to the seed of Abraham. The question, then, is not
   whether that which is promised in one sense shall be performed in
   another; but whether God's promises have, and shall certainly have, all
   of them, according to his intendment, any performance at all. And the
   aim of Mr Goodwin, in the example that he afterward produceth, is not
   to manifest that that which God promiseth shall certainly be performed
   only in that sense wherein he made his promise, but that they may be
   performed, or not performed at all. It is not in whose sense they shall
   have their performance, but whether they shall have any performance or
   no. If the thing promised be not accomplished, the promise is not at
   all in any sense performed, unless Mr Goodwin will distinguish, and say
   there are two ways of any thing's performance, one whereby it is
   performed, another whereby it is not. But he proceeds to manifest this
   assertion by an induction of instances.

   2. "God," saith he, "promised to Paul the lives of them that were in
   the ship. His intent and meaning was, not that they should all be
   preserved against whatever they in the ship might do to hinder that
   promise, but with this proviso or condition, that they in the ship
   should hearken unto him and follow his advice; which is evident from
   these words of Paul, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be
   saved:' and had they gone away, God had not made any breach of promise
   though they had been all drowned, Acts xxvii."

   Ans. First, when men seriously promise any thing, which is wholly and
   absolutely in their power to accomplish and bring about, causing
   thereby good men to rest upon their word, and to declare unto others
   their repose upon their honesty and worth, if they do not make good
   what they have spoken, we account them unworthy promise-breakers, and
   they do it at the peril of all the repute of honesty, honour, and
   faith, they have in the world. With God it seems it is otherwise. He
   makes a solemn, gracious promise to Paul that the lives of all them in
   the ship with him should be saved. Paul, on whom it was as much
   incumbent as on any man in the world not to engage the name of God
   (that God whom he worshipped and preached) in any thing whose truth
   might in the least be liable to exception, being in the way of
   declaring a new doctrine to the world, which would have been
   everlastingly prejudiced by any misprision of the faithfulness of that
   God in whose name and authority he preached it; the sum of that
   doctrine, also, being the exaltation of that God, in opposition to all
   the pretended deities of the world; [132] -- he, I say, boasts himself
   upon the promise that he had received that there should be "no loss of
   any man's life among them," verses 22, 25. He gives the reason of his
   confident assertion when all hope was taken away: Verse 25, "I believe
   God," saith he, "that it shall be even as it was told me." His faith in
   God was in reference to the event, that it should come to pass as it
   was told him. Faith in God, divine faith, can have nothing for its
   object that may fail it. He doth not say that he believes that God will
   be faithful to his promise in general, but also tells them wherein his
   faithfulness doth consist, even in the performance and accomplishment
   of that which he had promised. This he informs the centurion and the
   rest in the ship with him; and if in the issue it had otherwise fallen
   out, there had not been any colour of justifying the faith of that God
   he served, or his own truth in bearing witness to him. Had any
   perished, those that remained would have argued him of lying. "Yea, but
   saith he not himself, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be
   saved.'?" He did so indeed, and thereby declared the necessity of using
   suitable means, when Providence affords them to us, for the
   accomplishment of appointed, determined ends. God, who promiseth any
   thing, and affordeth means for the attaining of it, will direct them to
   whom those promises are made to the use of those means; as he doth the
   centurion by Paul. It being incumbent in this case on his holy Majesty,
   upon the account of his engaged faithfulness, to save them, he will yet
   have them subservient to his promise in their endeavours for their own
   safety. Means may be assigned for an end as to their ordinary
   subserviency thereunto, without any suspending of the event on them, as
   a condition of an uncertain issue and accomplishment. And therefore
   that this solemn promise made unto Paul, whose event and
   accomplishment, upon the account of his believing God, he absolutely
   believed, and whose performance he foretold, without the least
   intimation of any condition whatever (only he bids them not throw away
   the means of their preservation), should depend as to its fulfilling on
   such a condition as, in respect of the event, might not have been (God
   who made the promise not making any infallible provision for the
   condition), and so have been actually frustrate, is an assertion not
   only not grounded on these words of Paul, setting out the suitable
   means of the providence of God for the accomplishment of an appointed
   end, but also derogatory in the highest to the glory of the truth and
   faithfulness of God himself. But, --

   3. "That promise," saith he, "of our Saviour to his disciples, Matt.
   xix. 28, that they who followed him in the regeneration should sit upon
   twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, Judas being yet
   one of them, was not fulfilled; and in case the rest had declined, they
   also with him might have come short of the promise made unto them."

   Ans. Christ "knew what was in man," and had no need of any to tell him;
   he knew from the beginning who it was that should betray him, and
   plainly pronounced him to be a devil. He knew he was so, that he
   believed not; that he would continue so; that he would betray him; that
   his end would be desperate; he pronounced a curse upon him, as being
   cursed by David, Ps. cix., so many generations before his coming into
   the world: [133] and is it probable now that he promised this man a
   throne for his following him in the regeneration, which [it] is most
   certain (take it in what sense you will) he did never follow him in,
   but only as he gave him his bodily attendance in his going up and down?
   He was never admitted to be witness of his resurrection. The time being
   not yet come wherein a discovery was to be made of the hypocrisy of
   Judas, that he might have space to carry on the work which he had to
   do, and the number of those who in a peculiar manner were to bear
   witness to the completing of the whole work of regeneration in the
   resurrection of Christ being twelve, he who was afterward admitted into
   that number being one that now followed him, Acts i. 21, 22, our
   blessed Saviour telleth them indefinitely, to their consolation, what
   will be the glorious issue of their following him, and bearing witness
   to him in this work. That which is promissory in the words is made to
   them who forsook all and followed him in the work mentioned: which,
   assuredly, he who was always a thief, a devil, a covetous person, that
   followed not in the main of the work itself, was none of; that promise
   being afterward fulfilled to another then present with Christ. It is
   granted, if the rest of the twelve had fallen away, you may suppose of
   them what you please. That they might fall away is to beg that which
   you cannot prove, nor will ever be granted you, though you should
   resolve to starve yourself if you get it not. But this is, --

   4. "Confirmed out of Peter Martyr, whose doctrine it is that the
   promises of God are wont to be made with a respect unto the present
   estate and condition of things with men; -- that is, they shall be
   performed unto men abiding under the qualifications unto which they are
   made; as, for example, what promises soever God maketh to believers
   with respect had to their faith, or as they are believers, are not to
   be looked on as performable, or obliging the maker of them unto them,
   in case they shall relapse into their former unbelief."

   Ans. It is too well known how and to what end our author cites Peter
   Martyr and men of the same judgment with him in this controversy, and
   to how little advantage to his cause with discerning men he hath done
   it. In the same place from whence these words are taken, the author
   distinguisheth of the promises of God, and telleth you that some of
   them are conditional, which are, saith he, of a legal nature, which
   only show the connection between the condition or qualification they
   require and the thing they promise thereunto; and such are those
   whereof he speaks: but others, he tells you, are absolute and
   evangelical, not depending on any condition in us at all. And so he
   tells us, out of Chrysostom, that this of our Saviour, Matt. xix. 28,
   is of the former sort; and the accomplishment of such like promises as
   these he informs us to consist not in the actual fulfilling of what is
   conditionally affirmed, but in the certain truth of the axiom wherein
   the condition and the event as such are knit together.

   To the example urged, I shall only ask what Mr Goodwin's judgment is of
   the promises that God hath made to believers that they shall never
   relapse into their former state of unbelief, and on what condition they
   are made? Whether his promise of his love unto and acceptance of
   believers, wherein he will abide for ever, do not infer their
   preservation in the condition wherein they are (that is, as believers),
   will in the next place fall under our consideration. Your conclusion
   is, in the sense explained you admit the proposition, "Whatsoever God
   promiseth is certain," -- that is, it shall certainly be fulfilled, or
   it shall not!

   There is, moreover, no small contribution of strength, as to our
   establishment in the faith of it, given to our proposition by the
   signal engagement of the faithfulness of God for the accomplishment of
   the promises which he makes unto us, as it is manifested in these words
   of the apostle, 1 Cor. i. 9, "God is faithful, by whom ye were called
   unto the fellowship of his Son." In the foregoing verse, he telleth
   them that God will confirm them to the end, that they may be blameless
   in the day of the Lord Christ; of which confident assertion he gives
   them this account, "God is faithful," to make good his promises made
   unto them; he changeth not. When a promise is once passed, that which
   first presents itself to the consideration of them to whom it is made,
   and whose concernment it is that it be fulfilled, is the faithfulness
   of him that hath made the promise. This property of God's nature doth
   the apostle therefore mind the saints of, to lead them to a full
   assurance of their preservation. His promise being passed, fear not his
   faithfulness for its accomplishment. Might there in this case a
   supposal be allowed of any such interveniencies as might intercept them
   in the way of enjoying what God truly promised, and cause them to come
   short thereof, what assurance could arise to them from the
   consideration of the faithfulness of God, who made those promises unto
   them? The faithfulness of God, then, is engaged for the accomplishment
   of the thing promised, which also shall be done in case that fail not.
   So also 1 Thess. v. 23, 24, "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly;
   and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
   blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that
   calleth you, who also will do it." He assures them of their
   preservation in and unto the enjoyment of the things which he prayed
   for, and that upon the account of his faithfulness who had promised
   them. And saith he, "he will do it," -- namely, because he is faithful.
   Let the oppositions to it be never so many, the difficulties never so
   great, the interveniencies what they will, "he is faithful, and he will
   do it," as it is affirmed, 2 Thess. iii. 3, "But the Lord is faithful,
   who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil;" as also in 1 Cor. x.
   13, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
   ye are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
   that ye may be able to bear it." The same faithfulness of God is held
   out as that upon the account whereof no temptation shall befall
   believers, so as to separate them from him. The promise here peculiarly
   confirmed by it and established on it is such as no condition can
   tolerably be fixed unto. "I will not suffer believers to be overcome
   with temptations, in case they be not overcome with temptations," is a
   promise not to be ascribed to the infinite wisdom of God, with which we
   have to do; and yet no other can with the least colour be proposed. All
   sin, all falling from God, is upon temptation. Though Satan and the
   world should have no hand in drawing men aside from God, yet what they
   do from their own lusts, they do from temptation, James i. 14, 15. If
   God in his faithfulness will not suffer any temptation to prevail
   against believers, unless they neglect their duty and fall from him, --
   and they can no otherwise neglect their duty nor depart from him but
   upon the prevalency of temptation, -- their abiding with him, their
   final unconquerableness, hath a certainty answerable to the
   faithfulness of God.

   This part of our strength Mr Goodwin attempts to deprive us of, chap.
   xi. sect. 18, p. 236, in these words: "Whereas the apostle mentioneth
   the faithfulness of God' as that divine principle in him, or attribute,
   out of which he is moved to establish and confirm believers unto the
   end, and so keep them from evil, by faithfulness' he doth not
   necessarily mean that property or attribute of his that renders him
   true and just, or constant in the performance of his promises; as if
   the apostle in these or any like places supposed such a promise, one or
   more, made by him, by which he stands obliged to establish and confirm
   his saints unto the end by a strong and irresistible hand."

   Ans. 1. The sum of this answer is, that the apostle, by saying "God is
   faithful," doth not understand God's faithfulness. What other virtue is
   intended in God by his faithfulness but that whereby his truth and his
   constancy in words and promises is signified, I know not. Let the
   places from the beginning of the Scriptures to the end wherein there is
   mention made of the faith or faithfulness of God, of his being
   faithful, with the application thereof, the scope and intendment of the
   place, be perused, and see if they will give the least allowance to
   turn aside from eyeing the property and perfection of God before
   mentioned, as that which they peculiarly intend. Deut. vii. 9; Ps.
   xxxvi. 5, cxxxix. 1, 2, 5, cxliii. 1; Isa. xlix. 7; Hos. ii. 20; Rom.
   iii. 3; 2 Tim. ii. 13; Heb. x. 23, 1 John i. 9, are some of them. Why
   we should wring out another sense of the expression in this place, I
   know not.

   2. The faithfulness of God is not mentioned as that "divine principle
   out of which he is moved to establish and confirm believers to the
   end," but only to confirm them in the faith of his unchangeableness and
   constancy in accomplishing the work of his free grace, which he had
   begun in them and promised to confirm to the end. The work flows from
   the principle of his free grace in Jesus Christ, whence alone he gives
   them great, free, and precious promises. His stability and constancy in
   those promises, as to their performance, is intended by his
   faithfulness and truth in them. What are the promises of God improperly
   so called, and not exhibited in words, which you intimate, I know not.

   3. The apostle doth not only "suppose," but in the name and authority
   of God actually gives, in the places under consideration, promises of
   the certain and infallible preservation of believers to the end,
   asserting the immutability of God's engagement in them from his
   faithfulness. In brief, not to darken counsel and understanding with a
   multitude of words, by the promises of God we intend in a peculiar
   manner those expressed in the texts under consideration, -- namely,
   that God will establish believers to the end, keep them from evil and
   all temptations that would overthrow them; and by the faithfulness of
   God, from whence believers have their assurance of the accomplishment
   of these promises, [we intend] that which the Scripture holds out, and
   all the world of believers have hitherto taken, to be the faithfulness
   of God, as was before described. But it seems the word is here used
   otherwise; for, saith he, --

   "It is such a kind of faithfulness or disposition in him as that meant
   by Peter when he styleth him a faithful Creator.' Now, God is, and may
   properly be termed, a faithful Creator, because he constantly performs
   unto his creature whatsoever the relation of a Creator promiseth in an
   equitable and rational way unto it; which is, a great care and
   tenderness for the preservation and well-being of it. In like manner,
   he may, yea it is most likely that he is, called faithful' in his
   calling of men, as he is a spiritual Father or Creator, a giver of a
   new being unto men, because he never faileth to perform unto those new
   creatures of his whatsoever such a being as this, regularly'
   interpreted, promiseth unto him who receiveth it from him who is the
   donor of it; that is, convenient and sufficient means for the
   preservation and well-being of it. So that the faithfulness of God' in
   the scripture in hand supposes no such promise made by God as our
   opposers imagine, -- namely, whereby he should in terms or words stand
   engaged to establish, confirm, or keep believers from evil, his new
   creatures, his regenerated ones, after any such a manner but that they,
   if they be careless or negligent for themselves, may be shaken and
   decline, and commit evil notwithstanding."

   Ans. 1. That by God's faithfulness, mentioned in that place of Peter,
   such a disposition as you afterward describe is intended, you had
   better say than undertake to prove. It is evident the scope of the
   apostle is, to exhort the saints of God in all their trials and
   afflictions to commit themselves and their ways with patience and
   quietness unto God, upon the account of his power to preserve them as
   he is the Creator of all, and his constancy in receiving of them, being
   present with them, abiding with them, as he is faithful in his word and
   promises. Yea, and the interpretation our author would have fixed on
   the expression here used is not only remote from the intendment of the
   place, turning that into a general good disposition towards all his
   creatures which is intimated for the peculiar support of believers, and
   that in their distress, but also is in itself a false, fond, and loose
   assertion. There is no law nor relation of creation that lays hold on
   God so far as to oblige him to the communication of one drop of his
   goodness to any of the creatures beyond what is given them by their
   creation, or to continue that unto them for one moment, all the
   dispensation of himself unto his creatures flowing from his sovereign
   good pleasure, doing what he will with his own.

   2. He doth very faintly, when he hath made the farthest step in
   confident asserting that he dares venture upon (it may be, and it is
   most likely), suppose that the faithfulness of God in these places
   under consideration may be taken in such a sense as that before
   described. But, --

   (1.) This is no sense at all of the faithfulness of God, neither is the
   word ever used in Scripture to signify any such thing in God or man,
   nor can it with any tolerable sense be applied to any such thing;
   neither would there be any analogy between that which in God we call
   faithfulness and that virtue in man which is so termed. Nor is the
   faithfulness of God here mentioned upon any such account as will endure
   this description, being insisted on only to assure the saints of the
   steadfastness and unalterableness of God in the performance of his
   promises made to them; neither is the obligation of God to continue his
   love and favour, with grace and means of it, to believers, founded upon
   such a disposition as is imagined, but in the free purpose of his will,
   which he purposed in Jesus Christ before the world was. So that there
   is not the least appearance of truth or soundness of reasoning, or any
   thing that is desirable, in this attempt to corrupt the word of God.

   (2.) Then the faithfulness of God in the scriptures in hand bespeaks
   his truth and stability in the performance of his promises made of
   establishing believers to the end, keeping them from evil, not
   suffering any temptation to befall them, but making withal a way to
   escape. In all which God assures them he will prevent all such
   carelessness and negligence in them as is inconsistent with their
   establishment; which he will certainly accomplish.

   And this is our major proposition, with its supplies of light and
   strength, freed from such exceptions as Mr G. supposes it liable unto.

   For the assumption, I shall not much trouble myself with that
   ridiculous sense (called "a sober and orthodox explication") which Mr
   Goodwin is pleased to put upon it to allow it to pass current. "In this
   sense," saith he, "it is most true that God hath promised that all
   believers shall persevere; that is, that all true believers formally
   considered, that is, as such and abiding such, shall persevere, namely,
   in his grace and favour:" but this he presumes is not our sense, chap.
   xi. sect. 2, p. 226. And well he may presume it; for, whatever his
   greatest skill may enable him unto, we can make no sense of it but
   this, "God hath promised believers shall persevere in case they
   persevere;" which is to us upon the matter no sense at all. To
   persevere in God's grace and favour is to continue in faith and
   obedience; which if men do, God hath solemnly promised and sworn that
   they shall so do! Certainly there is an orthodox sense in God's
   promises that is not nonsense. Be it granted, then, that this is not
   our sense, not so much because not ours as because not sense, what is
   our meaning in this proposition? "It is," saith Mr Goodwin, "that God
   will so preserve believers that none of them shall make shipwreck of
   their faith, upon what quicksands of lust and sensuality soever they
   shall strike, against what rock of obduration and impenitency soever
   they dash." But I beseech you, who told you that this was our sense of
   this proposition? being, indeed, no more sense than that which you give
   in for your own. By "striking on the quicksands of lust, and dashing
   upon rocks of sensuality, impenitency, and obduration," you bare in
   other places sufficiently explained yourself to intend their falling
   under the power of sin. And is this asserted by us to be the tenor of
   God's promises to believers, or is it not? or do you not know that it
   is not so? Did ever any say that God preserveth men in believing under
   obduration and impenitency? -- that is, under unbelief; for no men can
   be obdurately impenitent but unbelievers. Do not you know that we
   maintain that the grace faithfully engaged to be bestowed on them is
   given them to this end, to preserve them from the power of sin, from
   obduration and impenitency, and shall certainly be effectual for that
   purpose?

Chapter VI. Particular promises illustrated.

   The former argument confirmed by an induction of particular instances
   -- Joshua i. 5 opened -- The concernment of all believers in that
   promise proved by the apostle, Heb. xiii. 5. -- The general interest of
   all believers in all the promises of God cleared -- Objections answered
   -- How Old Testament promises may be improved -- The promise insisted
   on relates principally to spirituals -- The strength of it to the end
   intended -- 1 Sam. xii. 22, to whom the promise there is given -- The
   twofold use of this promise: threats to wicked men of use to the
   saints; promises to the saints of use to wicked men -- Isa. iv. 2-4,
   Ps. lxxxix. 30-37, opened -- A condition of backsliding supposed in
   believers, yet they not rejected -- God's abiding with his saints upon
   the account of his, 1. Faithfulness; 2. Loving-kindness; 3. Covenant;
   4. Promise; 5. Oath -- The intendment of the words insisted on from 1
   Sam. xii. 22 -- Isa. xxvii. 2, 3, Zeph. iii. 17, illustrated -- The
   intendment of these words, "I will not forsake thee" -- The reason of
   the promise, and means promised therein -- No cause in them to whom the
   promise is made -- Ezek. xxxvi. 32, Isa. xliii. 22-25, opened; also
   Isa. lvii. 17 -- The cause in God himself only -- The "name" of God,
   what it imports; his all-sufficiency engaged therein, and his goodness
   -- The rise and fountain of all God's goodness to his people in his own
   good pleasure -- The sum of our argument from this place of Scripture
   -- Ps. xxiii. 4, 6, opened; the psalmist's use of assurance of
   perseverance -- Inferences from the last use -- 2 Tim. iv. 18 opened --
   All believers in the same condition as to perseverance with David and
   Paul -- The second inference from the place insisted on -- Assurance a
   motive to obedience, and is the end that God intends to promote thereby
   -- Ps. cxxv. 1, 2 explained; Ps. xxxvii. 28; Deut. xxxiii. 3 --
   Inferences from that place of the psalmist -- Perpetual preservation in
   the condition of saints promised to believers -- Mr G.'s objections and
   exceptions to our exposition and argument from this place removed --
   Promises made originally to persons, not qualifications -- Not the same
   reason of promises to the church and of threatenings to sinners --
   Other objections removed -- Isa. liv. 7-10, the mind of the Lord in the
   promise mentioned in that place opened -- The exposition given on that
   place and arguments from thence vindicated --Direction for the right
   improvement of promises -- Hos. ii. 19, 20, opened -- Of the general
   design of that chapter -- The first part, of the total rejection of the
   church and political state of the Jews -- The second, of promises to
   the remnant according to the election of grace -- Of this four
   particulars: 1. Of conversion, verses 14, 15; 2. Of obedience and
   forsaking all false worship, verses 16, 17; 3. Of peace and quietness,
   verse 18; 4. Discovering the fountain of all the mercies, verses 19, 20
   -- Some objections removed -- To whom this promise is made -- The
   promise farther opened; the persons to whom it is made -- Verse 14 of
   that chapter opened -- The wilderness condition whereunto men are
   allured by the gospel, what it imports: 1. Separation; 2. Entanglement
   -- God's dealing with a soul in its wilderness condition -- Promises
   given to persons in that condition -- The sum of the foregoing promises
   -- The persons to whom they are made farther described -- The nature of
   the main promise itself considered -- Of the main covenant between God
   and his saints -- The properties of God engaged for the accomplishment
   of this promise -- Mr G.'s exposition of this place considered and
   confuted -- John x. 27-29 opened, vindicated.

   Having cleared the truth of the one and meaning of the other
   proposition mentioned in the argument last proposed, I proceed to
   confirm the latter by an induction of particular promises. The first
   that I shall fix upon is that of Josh. i. 5, "I will be with thee: I
   will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." This promise, it is true, in
   this original copy of it, is a grant to one single person entering upon
   a peculiar employment; but the Holy Ghost hath eminently taught the
   saints of God to plead and improve it in all generations for their own
   advantage, and that not only upon the account of the general rule of
   the establishment of all promises in Jesus Christ to the glory of God
   by us, [134] but also by the application which himself makes of it unto
   them, and all their occasions wherein they stand in need of the
   faithfulness of God therein: Heb. xiii. 5, "Let your conversation be
   without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for
   he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." The apostle
   layeth down an exhortation in the beginning of the verse against the
   inordinate desire of the things of the world, that are laboured after
   upon the account of this present life. To give power and efficacy to
   his exhortation, he manifesteth all such desires to be altogether
   needless, upon consideration of His all-sufficiency who hath promised
   never to forsake them; which he manifests by an instance in this
   promise given to Joshua, giving us withal a rule for the application of
   all the promises of the Old Testament which were made to the church and
   people of God. Some labour much to rob believers of the consolation
   intended for them in the evangelical promises of the Old Testament,
   though made in general to the church, upon this account, that they were
   made to the Jews, and being to them peculiar, their concernment now
   lieth not in them. If this plea might be admitted, I know not any one
   promise that would more evidently fall under the power of it than this
   we have now in consideration. It was made to a peculiar person, and
   that upon a peculiar occasion, -- made to a general or captain of
   armies, with respect to the great wars he had to undertake upon the
   special command of God. May not a poor, hungry believer say, "What is
   this to me? I am not a general of an army, have no wars to make upon
   God's command. The virtue, doubtless, of this promise expired with the
   conquest of Canaan, and died with him to whom it was made." To manifest
   the sameness of love that is in all the promises, with their
   establishment in one Mediator, and the general concernment of believers
   in every one of them, however and on what occasion soever given to any,
   this promise to Joshua is here applied to the condition of the weakest,
   meanest, and poorest of the saints of God, to all and every one of
   them, be their state and condition what it will. And, doubtless,
   believers are not a little wanting to themselves and their own
   consolation that they do not more particularly close with those words
   of truth, grace, and faithfulness, which, upon sundry occasions and at
   divers times, have been given out unto the saints of old, even Abraham,
   Isaac, Jacob, David, and the residue of them who walked with God in
   their generations. These things in an especial manner are recorded for
   our consolation, "that we through patience and comfort of the
   Scriptures might have hope," Rom. xv. 4. Now, the Holy Ghost, knowing
   the weakness of our faith, and how apt we are to be beaten from closing
   with the promises, and from mixing them with faith, upon the least
   discouragement that may arise (as, indeed, this is none of the least,
   "That the promise is not made to us, it was made to others, and they
   may reap the sweetness of it; God may be faithful in it though we never
   enjoy the mercy intended by it;" I say), in the next words he leads
   believers by the hand to make the same conclusion with boldness and
   confidence, from this and the like promises, as David did of old, upon
   the many gracious assurances that he had received of the presence of
   God with him: Heb. xiii. 6, "So that," saith he (upon the account of
   that promise), "we may say boldly" (without staggering at it by
   unbelief), "The Lord is my helper." This is a conclusion of faith:
   "Because God said to Joshua, a believer, I will never leave thee, nor
   forsake thee' (though upon a particular occasion, and in reference to a
   particular employment), every believer may say with boldness, He is my
   helper.'?"

   It is true, the application of the promises here looks immediately unto
   temporals, but yet, being drawn out from the testimony of the
   continuance of the presence of God with his saints, doth much more
   powerfully conclude to spirituals; yea, the promise itself is of
   spiritual favour, and what concerns temporals is only from thence
   extracted. Let us, then, weigh a little the importance of this promise,
   which the apostle hath rescued from suffering under any private
   interpretation, and set at liberty to the use of all believers. To
   every one of them, then, God saith, directly and plainly, that he will
   "never leave them nor forsake them." If there should any question arise
   whether he should be taken at his word or no, it must be the devil that
   must be entertained as an advocate against him. [135] Unbelief, indeed,
   hath many pleas, and will have, in the breasts of saints, against
   closing with the faithfulness of God in this promise, and the issue of
   confidence in him which from a due closing with it would certainly
   flow. But shall our unbelief make the truth of God of none effect? He
   hath told us that "he will never leave us, nor forsake us." The old
   serpent, and some arguing from him herein, are ready to say, "Yea, hath
   God indeed said so?' The truth of it shall not indeed be surely so. It
   may be otherwise; for God doth know that many cases may fall out, that
   you may be utterly rejected by him, and cast out of his presence. You
   may have such oppositions rise against you in your walking with him as
   shall certainly overcome you and set you at enmity with him, or you may
   fully depart from him." And many such like pleadings will Satan furnish
   the unbelief of believers withal. If they are not sufficiently taught
   by experience what it is to give credit to Satan endeavouring to impair
   and call in question, upon any pretence whatever, the faithfulness of
   God and his truth, when will they learn it? Surely they have little
   need to join with their adversaries for the weakening of their
   supportments or the impairing of their consolations. Whereas there is
   an endeavour to make men believe that the denying any absolutely
   unchangeable promise of God unto believers makes much for their comfort
   and refreshment, it shall afterward be considered in common, in
   reference also to those other demonstrations of the saints'
   perseverance that shall, God willing, be produced.

   It will be excepted, that "God will not forsake them whilst they are
   believers; but if they forsake him and fall from him, he is at liberty
   to renounce them also." But that God's not-forsaking of any is no more
   but a mere non-rejection of them shall afterward be disproved. Whom he
   doth not forsake as a God in covenant, to them doth he continue his
   presence, and towards them he exerciseth his power and all-sufficiency
   for their good. And if he can [not] by his Spirit and the power of his
   grace keep them whom he doth not forsake in a state and condition of
   not-forsaking him, he doth forsake them before they forsake him, yea,
   before he is said to forsake them. God's not-forsaking believers is
   effectually preventive of that state and condition in them on the
   account whereof it is asserted that he may forsake them.

   1 Sam. xii. 22, the truth we have under consideration is confirmed by
   the prophet in the name and authority of God himself; and the words
   wherein it is done have the force of a promise, being declarative of
   the good-will of God unto his people in Christ: "For the Lord will not
   forsake his people for his great name's sake; because it hath pleased
   the Lord to make you his people."

   The expression is the same with that which the Lord gives his people of
   his good-will in the covenant of grace; of which I have spoken before.
   [136] Many may be their calamities and afflictions, many their trials
   and temptations, many their desertions and darknesses, but God will not
   forsake them; he will not utterly cast them off for ever. That his
   people are his people in covenant, his secret ones, his spiritual
   church, the "remnant according to the election of grace," hath been
   before declared, in the handling of like places of Scripture. It is to
   vindicate this and the like promises from all surmises of failing and
   coming short of accomplishment that the apostle saith, "God hath not
   cast away his people which he foreknew," Rom. xi. 2; that is, he hath
   made good his promise to them, even to them among the Jews whom he did
   so foreknow as also to "predestinate them to be conformed to the image
   of his Son," chap. viii. 29: so out of all Israel saving "all Israel,"
   even the whole Israel of God. That a discriminating purpose of God is
   intended in that expression hath been already declared, and shall, the
   Lord assisting, be farther manifested.

   The promise as here mentioned hath a double use:--

   1. It is held out as an inducement to obedience to that whole people;
   in reference whereunto he telleth them that "if they did wickedly, they
   should be destroyed, both they and their king," 1 Sam. xii. 25. In the
   dreadful threatenings that God denounceth against wicked and impenitent
   ones, he hath an end to accomplish in reference to his saints, unto his
   own, even to make them know his terror, and to be acquainted with the
   abomination of sin. And in his promises, intended directly to them, he
   hath designs to accomplish upon the most wicked and ungodly, even to
   discover his approbation of that which is good, that they may be left
   inexcusable.

   2. It was a testimony of his good-will unto his secret ones, his
   remnant., his residue, his brand out of the fire, unto his people
   called according to his eternal purpose, in the midst of his people by
   external profession, and of his presence with them, under the
   accomplishment of the threatening mentioned upon the generality of that
   nation. He did not forsake them when the people in general and their
   king were destroyed. Whatever outward dispensation he bringeth upon the
   whole, the love and grace of the promise shall certainly be reserved
   for them; as, Isa. iv. 2-4, the "remnant," the "escaping of Israel,"
   those that were "written unto life," shall obtain, when the rest are
   destroyed or hardened.

   So Ps. lxxxix. 30-37, "If his children forsake my law, and walk not in
   my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
   then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity
   with stripes. Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take
   from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I not
   break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I
   sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. His seed shall
   endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be
   established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven.
   Selah."

   A supposal is made of such was and walkings in the spiritual seed and
   offspring of the Lord Christ (which in the psalm is typed out by
   David), that the Lord will be as it were compelled to deal sharply with
   them for their iniquities and transgressions: yet his
   "loving-kindness," that shall abide with Christ in reference to the
   preservation of his seed; his "faithfulness," that shall not fail; his
   covenant and his oath shall be made good to the uttermost.

   It is supposed (which is the worst that can be supposed) that in some
   degree, at least for some season, they may forsake the law, not keep
   the commandments, and profane the statutes of God (which continues the
   burden of poor believers to this day); yet the worst that the Lord
   threatens them with on this account, when they might have expected that
   he would have utterly cast off such unthankful, unfruitful backsliders,
   poor creatures, is but this, "I will visit them with a rod, and with
   stripes." They shall have whatever comes within the compass of
   correction or affliction; rod and stripes shall be on them, and that
   whether outward correction or inward desertion. But will the Lord
   proceed no farther? will he not for ever cast them off, and ease
   himself of such a provoking generation? "No," saith the Lord; "there
   lie five things in the way, upon whose account I cannot so deal with
   them." All regard the same persons, as is evident from the antithesis
   that is in the discourse.

   1. There is my loving-kindness, saith God, which is eternal and
   unchangeable; for "I love them with an everlasting love," Jer. xxxi. 3.
   This I cannot utterly take away. Though it may be hid and eclipsed as
   to the appearance and influences of it, yet utterly it shall not be
   taken away as to the reality of it. Though I chasten and correct them,
   yet my loving-kindness shall be continued to them. And then, saith he,
   --

   2. There is my faithfulness, which I have engaged to them; which,
   whatever they do (that is, that I will suffer them to do, or that they
   may do upon supposition of the grace of the covenant, [137] wherewith
   they are supplied), though they behave themselves very foolishly and
   frowardly, yet that I must take care of, -- that must not fail. 2 Tim.
   ii. 13, "He abideth faithful; he cannot deny himself." And this
   faithfulness, saith God, I have engaged in three things:--

   (1.) In my covenant that I have made with them to be their God, and
   wherein I have promised that they shall be my people; wherein also I
   have made plentiful provision of mercy and grace for all their
   failings. And this must not be broken; my faithfulness is in it, and it
   must abide. My covenant of peace that I make with them is an
   everlasting covenant; it is "an everlasting covenant, ordered in all
   things and sure," 2 Sam. xxiii. 5; Ezek. xxxvii. 26; it is a covenant
   of peace, an everlasting covenant.

   (2.) "In the thing that is gone out of my lips," or the grace and love
   I have spoken of in the promise. Herein also will I be faithful, and
   that shall not be altered. All my promises are yea and amen in Christ
   Jesus, 2 Cor. i. 20. And, --

   (3.) Lastly, All this I have confirmed by an oath, "I have sworn by my
   holiness," and "I will not lie."

   So that in all these immutable things, wherein it is "impossible for
   God to lie," he hath treasured up strong consolation for them that do
   believe. [138] Though, then, the seed of Christ, which he is to see
   upon the account of his suffering for them (Isa. liii. 10), do sin and
   transgress, yet God hath put all these gracious obligations upon
   himself to reduce them by correction and affliction, but never to
   proceed to final sentence of utter rejection.

   To this purpose, I say, are the words in the place of Samuel now
   mentioned:--

   1. The matter of the promise, or what he promiseth the people, is, "he
   will not forsake them." God's not-forsaking them is not a bare not
   casting them off, but an active continuance with them in love and
   mercy. He exercises not a pure negative act of his will towards any
   thing or person. Whom he hates not, he loves. So Heb. xiii. 5, these
   words, "I will not forsake thee," hold out a continual supply of all
   those wants whereunto in ourselves we are exposed, and what from his
   presence we do receive. "I will not forsake them" is, "I will continue
   my presence with them, a God in covenant." So he expresseth his
   presence with them, Isa. xxvii. 3, "I the Lord do keep it; I will water
   it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." He
   abideth with his vineyard, so as to keep it and to preserve it from
   being destroyed. But may it not at one time or other be surprised into
   desolation? No; saith he, "I will keep it night and day." But what if
   this vineyard prove barren? what will he then do? Nay, but he will so
   deal with it that it shall never be so barren as to cause him to cast
   it up. He is not with it for nought; his presence is attended with
   grace and kindness. "I will water it," saith he; and that not now and
   then, but "every moment." He pours out fresh supplies of his Spirit
   upon it to make it fruitful. Thence it becomes "a vineyard of red
   wine," verse 2; the best wine, the most delicious, the most precious,
   to cheer the heart of God himself, as Zeph. iii. 17, "The Lord thy God
   in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee
   with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with
   singing." He causes them thereby that come out of Jacob to take root;
   he makes Israel blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with
   fruit. This is that which God promiseth his people: He will not forsake
   them, he will always give them his presence, in the kindness and
   supplies of a God in covenant, to protect them from others, to make
   them fruitful to himself. This is his not-forsaking them. He will
   preserve them from others; who shall take them out of his hand? He will
   make them fruitful to himself; "he will work, and who shall let him?"

   2. The reason why the Lord will not forsake his people, why he will
   continue doing them good, is expressed in these words, "For his great
   name's sake." And in this assertion two things are considerable:--

   (1.) A tacit exclusion of any thing in themselves for which, or upon
   consideration whereof, God will constantly abide with them. It is not
   for their sakes, for any thing in them, or for what they have done,
   may, or can do, -- it is not upon the account of any condition or
   qualification whatever that may or may not be found in them, -- but
   merely for his name's sake; which in the like case he expresseth fully,
   Ezek. xxxvi. 32, "Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be
   it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house
   of Israel." The truth is, they may prove such as, on all accounts
   whatever, shall deserve to be rejected, -- that nothing in appearance,
   or in their own sense, as well as others', though the root of the
   matter be in them, may be found upon them, -- when God takes delight in
   them; like those you have described at large, Isa. xliii. 22-25, "But
   thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me,
   O Israel. Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy
   burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I
   have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with
   incense. Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast
   thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to
   serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. I,
   even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake,
   and will not remember thy sins." Weary of God they are, neglecting his
   worship, making his patience and forbearance to serve with their
   iniquities. It seems to be impossible almost for any creature to
   apprehend that God will not give them up to everlasting confusion. Yea,
   perhaps they may be froward in their follies, and contend with God when
   he goes to heal them: Isa. lvii. 17, "For the iniquity of his
   covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and
   he went on frowardly in the way of his heart." Iniquity is upon them, a
   vile iniquity, "the iniquity of covetousness," God is wroth with them,
   and smites, and hides him, and they go on frowardly. And yet for all
   this he "forsaketh not for ever," he abides to be their God; and that
   because his so doing is not bottomed on any consideration of what they
   are, have been, or will be, but he doth it for his name's sake, and
   with regard unto that which thereupon he will do for them. And upon
   this account this promise of God's abiding and continuing with his, let
   grace be never so weak, corruption never so strong, temptations never
   so violent, may be pleaded; and the Lord rejoices to be put in
   remembrance of it by the weakest, frailest, sinfulest saint or believer
   in the world.

   (2.) The cause or reason is positively expressed why God will not
   forsake them: it is "for his great name's sake." His great name is all
   that he consults withal about his continuance with his people. This he
   calls himself, Isa. xliii. 25, "I am he that blotteth out thy
   transgressions for mine own sake;" that is, "For no other cause in the
   world that may be found in thee or upon thee." The "name "of God is all
   that whereby to us he is known; all his attributes, his whole will, --
   all his glory. When God is said to do any thing for his name, it is
   either the cause and end of what he doth, or the principle from whence
   with the motive wherefore he doth it, that is by him intended. In the
   first sense, to do a thing for his name's sake is to do it for the
   manifestation of his glory, that he may be known to be God in the
   excellency of those perfections whereby he reveals himself to his, with
   most frequently a special regard to his faithfulness and grace. It is
   in these properties to make himself known, and to be exalted in the
   hearts of his. So all his dispensations in Jesus Christ are for "the
   praise of the glory of his grace," Eph. i. 6, -- that he may be
   exalted, lifted up, made known, believed, and received as a God
   pardoning iniquity in the Son of his love. And in this sense may the
   Lord be said to abide with his people "for his name's sake," for the
   exalting of his glory, that he may be known to be a God faithful in
   covenant and unchangeable in his love, who will not "cast off for ever"
   those whom he hath once received into favour. It will not enter into
   the hearts of believers sometimes why the Lord should so deal with them
   as he doth, and not cast them off. Their souls may go to rest as to
   this thing. He himself is glorious herein; he is exalted, and doth it
   on that account. If by his "name" you understand the principle from
   whence he worketh, and his motive thereunto, as it comprehends the
   whole longsuffering, gracious, tender, unchangeable nature of God,
   according as he hath revealed himself in Jesus Christ, in whom his name
   is, Exod. xxiii. 21, and which he hath committed to him to be
   manifested, John xvii. 6; so evidently two things in God are engaged,
   when he promiseth to work for his name's sake, or according to his
   great name:--

   [1.] His power or sufficiency. Upon the engagement of the name of God
   on "his people's behalf, Moses carefully pleads this latter or part
   thereof, Numb. xiv. 17-19. God hath given his name unto his people; and
   this is wrapped up in that mercy, that he will lay out his power to
   pardon, heal, and do them good, in his preserving of them and abiding
   with them: "Let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast
   spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering," etc. And as, when he works
   for his name, the way whereby he will do it is according to the
   greatness of his power, so the fountain and rise from whence he will do
   it is, --

   [2.] His goodness, kindness, love, patience, mercy, grace,
   faithfulness, in Jesus Christ. And thus, under the title of his "name,"
   doth he call poor, afflicted, dark, hopeless, helpless creatures (upon
   any other account in the world), persons ready to be swallowed up in
   disconsolation and sorrow, to rest upon him: Isa. i. 10, "Who is among
   you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that
   walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of
   the Lord, and stay upon his God." [139] When all other holds are gone,
   when flesh fails and heart fails, then doth God call poor souls to rest
   upon this name of his. So the psalmist, Ps. lxxiii. 26, "My flesh and
   my heart faileth," all strength, natural and spiritual, falleth and is
   gone: "but God is the strength of my heart," saith he, "and my portion
   for ever." Now, this is the sole motive also of God's continuance with
   his: he will do it because he himself is good, gracious, merciful,
   loving, tender; and he will lay out these properties to the utmost in
   their behalf, that it may be well with them, lifting up, exalting, and
   making himself gracious in so doing. This the Lord emphatically
   expresseth five times in one verse: Isa. xlvi. 4, "Even to your old age
   I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I
   will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you."

   This, then, I say, is the reason and only ground, this the principal
   aim and end, upon the account whereof the Lord will "not forsake his
   people."

   3. The rise of all this goodness, kindness, faithfulness of God to his
   people, as to the exercise of it, is also expressed, and that is his
   own good pleasure: "Because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his
   people." This is the spring and fountain of all the goodness mentioned.
   God is essentially in himself of a good, gracious, and loving nature;
   but he acts all these properties, as to the works that outwardly are of
   him, "after the counsel of his own will," Eph. i. 11, according to the
   purpose which he purposeth in himself, and his purposes, all of them,
   have no other rise or cause but his own good pleasure. Why did the Lord
   make us his people, towards whom he might act according to the gracious
   properties of his nature, yea, and lay them forth and exercise them to
   the utmost on our behalf? Was it because we were better than others?
   did his will? walked with him? Did he declare we should be his people
   upon condition we did so and so? Not on any of these or the like
   grounds of proceeding doth he do this, but merely because "it pleaseth
   him to make us his people;" Matt. xi. 26. And shall we think that he
   who took us to be his people notwithstanding our universal alienation
   from him, on the account of his own good pleasure, which caused him to
   make us his people (that is, obedient, believing, separated from the
   world), will upon any account, being himself unchangeable, not preserve
   us in, but reject us from, that condition?

   Thus is God's mercy in not forsaking his people resolved into its
   original principle, -- namely, his own good pleasure in choosing of
   them, carried on by the goodness and unchangeableness of his own nature
   to the appointed issue.

   This, then, is the sum of this argument: What work or design the Lord
   entereth upon merely from his own good pleasure, or solely in answer to
   the purpose which he purposeth in himself and engageth to continue in
   mercy for his name's sake, thereby taking upon him to remove or prevent
   whatever might hinder the accomplishment of that purpose, work, or
   design of his, that he will abide in unchangeable to the end; but this
   is the state of the Lord's undertaking, to abide, with his people, as
   hath been manifested at large.

   Let us add in the next place that of the psalmist: Ps. xxiii. 4, 6,
   "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear
   no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and
   I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever." The psalmist
   expresseth an exceeding confidence in the midst of most inexpressible
   troubles and pressures. He supposes himself "walking through the valley
   of the shadow of death." As "death" is the worst of evils, and
   comprehensive of them all, so the "shadow" of death is the most dismal
   and dark representation of those evils to the soul, and the "valley" of
   that shadow the most dreadful bottom and depth of that representation.
   This, then, the prophet supposed that he may be brought into. A
   condition wherein he may be overwhelmed with sad apprehensions of the
   coming of a confluence of all manner of evils upon him, -- and that not
   for a short season, but he may be necessitated to walk in them, which
   denotes a state of some continuance, a conflicting with most dismal
   evils, and in their own nature tending to death, -- is in the supposal.
   What, then, would he do if he should be brought into this estate? Saith
   he, "Even in that condition, in such distress, wherein I am, to my own
   and the eyes of others, hopeless, helpless, gone, and lost, I will fear
   no evil.'?" A noble resolution, if there be a sufficient bottom and
   foundation for it, that it may not be accounted rashness and groundless
   confidence, but true spiritual courage and holy resolution. Saith he,
   "It is because the Lord is with me." But, alas! what if the Lord should
   now forsake thee in this condition, and give thee up to the power of
   thine enemies, and suffer thee, by the strength of thy temptations,
   wherewith thou art beset, to fall utterly from him? Surely then thou
   wouldst be swallowed up for ever; the waters would go over thy soul,
   and thou must for ever lie down in the shades of death. "Yea," saith
   he, "but I have an assurance of the contrary; goodness and mercy shall
   follow me all the days of my life.'?"

   "But this," say some, "is a very desperate persuasion. If thou art sure
   that goodness and mercy shall follow thee all the days of thy life,
   then live as thou pleasest, as loosely as flesh can desire, as wickedly
   as Satan can prompt thee to. Certainly this persuasion is fit only to
   ingenerate in thee a high contempt of humble and close walking with
   God. What other conclusion canst thou possibly make of that presumption
   but only this, I may, then, do what I please, what I will; let the
   flesh take its swing in all abominations, it matters not, goodness and
   mercy shall follow me.' Alas!" saith the psalmist, "these thoughts
   never come into my heart. I find this persuasion, through the grace of
   Him in whom it is effectual, to in-generate contrary resolutions, This
   is that which I am, upon the account hereof, determined on, I will
   dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.' Seeing goodness and mercy
   shall follow me,' I will dwell in his house; and seeing they shall
   follow me all the days of my life,' I will dwell in his house for
   ever."

   There are, then, these two things in this last verse pregnant to the
   purpose in hand:--

   1. The psalmist's assurance of the presence of God with him "for ever,"
   and that in kindness and pardoning mercy, upon the account of his
   promise unto him. "Goodness or benignity," saith he, "shall follow me
   into every condition, to assist me and extricate my soul, even out of
   the valley of the shadow of death." A conclusion like that of Paul, 2
   Tim. iv. 18, "The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
   preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom." Having, verse 17, given
   testimony of the presence of God with him in his great trial, when he
   was brought before that devouring monster Nero, giving him deliverance,
   he manifesteth in verse 18 that the presence of God with him was not
   only effectual for one or another deliverance, but that it will keep
   him "from every evil work," not only from the rashness, cruelty, and
   oppression of others, but also from any such way or work of his own
   which should lay a bar against his enjoyment of and complete
   preservation unto that heavenly kingdom whereunto he was appointed.

   What reason, now, can be imagined why other saints of God, who have the
   same promises with David and Paul, established unto them in the hand of
   the same Mediator, being equally taken into the same covenant of mercy
   and peace with them, may not make the same conclusion of mercy with
   them, -- namely, "That the mercy and goodness of God will follow them
   all the days of their lives; that they shall be delivered from every
   evil work, and preserved to God's heavenly kingdom?" 2 Cor. i. 20. To
   fly here to immediate revelation, as though God had particularly and
   immediately assured some persons of their perseverance, which begat in
   them a confidence wherein others may not share with them, besides that
   it is destructive of all the vigour and strength of sundry, if not all
   the arguments produced against the saints' perseverance, it is not in
   this place of any weight, or at all relative to the business in hand;
   for evident it is that one of them, even David, is thus confident upon
   the common account of God's relation unto all his saints, as he is
   their shepherd, one that takes care of them, and will see, not only
   whilst they abide with him, that they shall have pasture and
   refreshment, but also will find them out in their wanderings, and will
   not suffer any of them to be utterly lost. And he is a shepherd equally
   in care and love to every one of his saints as he was to David. He
   gives them all "the sure mercies of David," even the mercy contained
   and wrapped up in the promise that was given to them, and what by
   virtue thereof he did enjoy, with what he received from God in that
   covenant relation wherein he stood, Isa. lv. 3. And for Paul, it is
   most evident that he grounded his confidence and consolation merely
   upon the general promise of the presence of God with his, that he will
   "never leave them nor forsake them," but be their God and "guide even
   unto death;" neither is there the least intimation of any other bottom
   of his consolation herein. Now, these being things wherein every
   believer, even the weakest in the world, hath an equal share and
   interest with Paul, David, or any of the saints in their generations,
   what should lie in their way but that they also may grow up to this
   assurance, being called thereunto? I say, they may grow up unto it. I
   do not say that every believer can with equal assurance of mind thus
   make his boast in the Lord and in the continuance of his kindness to
   him, -- the Lord knows we are oftentimes weak and dark, and at no small
   loss even as to the main of our interest in the promises of God; -- but
   there being an equal certainty in the things themselves of which we
   speak, it being as certain that the goodness and mercy of God shall
   follow them all their days as it did David, and as certain that God
   will deliver them from every evil work and preserve them to his
   heavenly kingdom as he did Paul, they also may grow up unto, and ought
   to press after, the like assurance and consolation with them. Whom
   goodness and mercy shall follow all their days, and who shall be of God
   preserved from every evil work, they can never fall totally and finally
   out of the favour of God. That this is the state and condition of
   believers is manifested from the instances given of David and Paul,
   testifying their full persuasion and assurance concerning that
   condition on grounds common to them with all believers.

   2. The conclusion and inference that the psalmist makes, from the
   assurance which he had of the continuance of the goodness and kindness
   of God unto him, followeth in the words insisted on: "All the days of
   his life he would dwell in the Lord's house." He would for ever give up
   himself unto his worship and service. "Seeing this is the case of my
   soul, that God will never forsake me, let me answer this love of God in
   my constant obedience." Now, this conclusion follows from the former
   principle upon a twofold account:--

   (1.) As it is a motive unto it. The continuance of the goodness and
   kindness of God unto a soul is a constraining motive unto that soul to
   continue with him in love, service, and obedience; it works powerfully
   upon a heart any way ennobled with the ingenuity of grace to make a
   suitable return, as far as possibly it can, to such eminent mercy and
   goodness. I profess I know not what those men think the saints of God
   to be, who suppose them apt to make conclusions of wantonness and
   rebellion upon the account of the steadfastness of the love and
   kindness of God to them. I shall not judge any as to their state and
   condition; yet I cannot but think that such men's prejudices and
   fullness of their own persuasions do exceedingly interpose in their
   spirits from receiving that impression of this grace of God which in
   its own nature it is apt to give, or it would be impossible they should
   once imagine that of itself it is apt to draw the spirits of men into a
   neglect and contempt of God.

   (2.) As the end of God, intended in giving that assurance, to the
   effecting whereof it is exceedingly operative and effectual. So you
   have it, Luke i. 74, 75. This is the intendment of God in confirming
   his oath and promise unto us, "That he may grant unto us, that we being
   delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
   in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives."

   Now, though these forementioned, with many other texts of Scripture,
   are plain, evident, and full to the business we have in hand, yet the
   adversaries of this truth having their hands so full with them that are
   commonly urged that they cannot attend unto them, I shall not need to
   spend time in their vindication from exceptions which none that I know
   have as yet brought in against them (though, upon their principles,
   they might possibly be invented), but shall leave them to be mixed with
   faith, according as God by his Spirit shall set them home upon the
   souls of them who do consider them.

   The whole of Ps. cxxv. might, in the next place, be brought in to give
   testimony to the truth in hand. I shall only take a proof from the
   first two verses of it: "They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount
   Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for even -as the mountains
   are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from
   henceforth even for ever." Whereunto answereth that of Ps. xxxvii. 28,
   "The Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are
   preserved for ever;" as also Deut. xxxiii. 3, "Yea, he loveth his
   people; all his saints are in thy hand." In the verses named, I shall a
   little fix upon two things conducing to our purpose, which are
   evidently contained in them:--

   1. A promise of God's everlasting presence with his saints, believers,
   them that trust in him, and their steadfastness thereupon: "They shall
   be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed;" and that because "the Lord
   is round about them," and that "for ever."

   2. An allusive comparison of both these, both their stability and God's
   presence with them, given for the encouragement of weak believers, with
   special regard to the days wherein the promise was first made, which
   actually also belongs to them on whom the ends of the world are fallen.
   The psalmist bids them, as it were, lift up their eyes, and look upon
   mount Zion and the hills that were round about Jerusalem, and tells
   them that God will as certainly and assuredly continue with them and
   give them establishment as those hills and mountains which they beheld
   round about abide in their places; so that it shall be as impossible
   for all the powers of hell to remove them out of the favour of God as
   for a man to pluck up mount Zion by the roots, or to overturn the
   foundations of the mountains that stand round about Jerusalem. It is
   true, the Holy Ghost hath special regard to the oppositions and
   temptations that they were to undergo from men, but bears also an equal
   regard to all other means of separating them from their God. It would
   be a matter of small consolation unto them that men should not prevail
   over them for ever, if in the meantime there be other more close and
   powerful adversaries, who may cast them down with a perpetual
   destruction. Some few considerations of the intendment of the place
   will serve for the enforcing of our argument from this portion of
   Scripture:--

   1. That which is here promised the saints is a perpetual preservation
   of them in that condition wherein they are; both on the part of God,
   "he is round about them from henceforth even for ever;" and on their
   parts, "they shall not be removed," -- that is, from the state and
   condition of acceptation with him wherein they are supposed to be, --
   but abide for ever, and continue therein immovable into the end. It is,
   I say, a plain promise of their continuance in that condition wherein
   they are, with their safety from thence, and not a promise of some
   other good thing provided that they continue in that condition. Their
   being compared to mountains and their stability, which consists in
   their being and continuing so, will admit no other sense. As mount Zion
   abides in its condition, so shall they; and as the mountains about
   Jerusalem continue, so doth the Lord his presence unto them.

   2. That expression which is used, verse 2, is weighty and fall to this
   purpose, "The Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for
   ever." What can be spoken more fully, more pathetically? Can any
   expression of men so set forth the truth which we have in hand? The
   Lord is round about them, not to save them from this or that incursion,
   but from all; not from one or two evils, but from every one whereby
   they are or may be assaulted. He is with them, and round about them on
   every side, that no evil shall come nigh them. It is a most full
   expression of universal preservation, or of God's keeping his saints in
   his love and favour, upon all accounts whatsoever; and that not for a
   season only, but it is "henceforth," from his giving this promise unto
   their souls in particular, stud their receiving of it in all
   generations, according to their appointed times, "even for ever."

   Some few exceptions, with a great surplusage of words and phrases, to
   make them seem other things than what have been formerly insisted on
   again and again, are advanced by Mr Goodwin, to overturn this Zion and
   to cast down the mountains that are about Jerusalem, chap. xi. sect. 9,
   pp. 230-232. The sum of our argument from hence, as of the intendment
   of this place, is this: Those whom the Lord will certainly preserve for
   ever in the state and condition of trusting in him, they shall never be
   forsaken of him nor separated from him. The latter clause of this
   proposition is that which we contend for, the whole of that whose proof
   is incumbent on us. Of this the former part is a sufficient basis and
   foundation, being comprehensive of all that is or can be required to
   the unquestionable establishment thereof, [which] from the letter of
   the text we assume. But God will certainly preserve for ever all his
   saints that put their trust in him, in their so doing, that they shall
   not be altered or cast down from that state and condition. Change but
   the figurative expressions in the text, and the allusions used for the
   accommodation of their faith in particular to whom this promise was
   first given, into other terms of a direct and proper significancy, and
   the text and the assumption of our argument will appear to be the same;
   whence the conclusion intended will undeniably follow. Unto this clear
   deduction of the truth contended for from this place of Scripture, the
   discourse ensuing, in the place mentioned, is opposed:--

   1. "The promise only assures them that trust in the Lord that they
   shall be preserved, but not at all that they that trust in him shall be
   necessitated to do so still, or that so they shall do. So Paul saith,
   It was in my heart to live and die with the Corinthians;' but doubtless
   with this proviso, that they always continued such as they then were,
   or as he apprehended them to be, when he so wrote to them."

   Ans. I must be forced to smite this evasion once and again before we
   arrive at the close of this contest, it being so frequently made use of
   by our adversary, who without it knows himself not able to stand
   against the evidence of any one promise usually insisted on. This is
   the substance of all that which, with exceeding delightful variety of
   expressions, is a hundred times made use of: "The promise is
   conditional, and made to those that trust in the Lord, and is to be
   made good only upon the account of their continuing so to do; but that
   they shall so do, that they shall continue to trust in the Lord, that
   is wholly left to themselves, and not in the least undertaken in the
   promise." And this is called a "discharging or dismissing of places of
   Scripture from the service whereunto, contrary to their proper sense
   and meaning, they are pressed," a "delivering them from the bearing the
   cross of this warfare," with such like imperial terms and expressions.
   To speak in the singleness of our spirit, we cannot see any one of the
   discharged soldiers returning from the camp, wherein they have long
   served for the safety and consolation of them that do believe.
   Particularly, this Scripture detests the gloss with violence imposed on
   it, and tells you that the end for which the God of truth sent it into
   this service., wherein it abides, is to assure them that trust in the
   Lord that they shall be preserved in that condition to the end; that in
   the condition of trusting and depending on God, they shall be as Zion,
   and the favour of God unto them as the immovable mountains, -- he will
   for ever be with them and about them; and that all this shall certainly
   come to pass. Christ [David?] does not say that they shall be as
   established mountains if they continue to trust in the Lord, but they
   shall be so in their trusting, abiding for ever therein, through the
   safeguarding presence of God. For their being necessitated to continue
   trusting in the Lord, there is not any thing in [the] text, or in our
   argument from thence, or in the doctrine we maintain, that requires or
   will admit of any such proceeding of God as by that expression is
   properly signified. Indeed, there is a contradiction in terms, if they
   are used to the same purpose. To trust in the Lord is the voluntary,
   free act of the creature. To be necessitated unto this act and in the
   performance of it, so that it should be done necessarily as to the
   manner of its doing, is wholly destructive to the nature and being of
   it. That God can effectually and infallibly as to the event cause his
   saints to continue trusting in him without the least abridgment of
   their liberty, yea, that he doth so eminently by heightening and
   advancing their spiritual liberty, shall be afterward declared. If by
   "Necessitated to continue trusting," not the manner of God's operation
   with and in them for the compassing of the end proposed, and the
   efficacy of his grace, whereby he doth it (commonly decried under these
   terms), be intended, but only the certainty of the issue, rejecting the
   impropriety of the expression, the thing itself we affirm to be here
   promised of God. But it is urged, --

   2. "That this promise is not made unto the persons of any, but merely
   unto their qualifications; like that, He that believeth shall be
   saved;' it is made to the grace of trusting, obedience, and walking
   with God: for threatenings are made to the evil qualifications of men."

   Ans. This it seems, then, we are come unto (and what farther progress
   may be made the Lord knows): The gracious promises of God, made to his
   church, his people, in the blood of Jesus, on which they have rolled
   themselves with safety and security in their several generations, are
   nothing but bare declarations of the will of God, what he allows and
   what he rejects, with the firm concatenation that is between faith and
   salvation, obedience and reward. And this, it seems, is the only use of
   them: which if it be so, I dare boldly say that all the saints of God
   from the foundation of the world have most horribly abused his
   promises, and forced them to other ends than ever God intended them
   for. Doubtless all those blessed souls who are fallen asleep in the
   faith of Jesus Christ, having drawn refreshment from these breasts of
   consolation, could they be summoned to give in their experience of what
   they have found in this kind, would with one mouth profess that they
   found far more in them than mere conditional declarations of the will
   of God; yea, that they received them in faith as the engagement of his
   heart and good-will towards them, and that he never failed in the
   accomplishment and performance of all the good mentioned in them.
   Neither will that emphatical expression in the close of the second
   verse (which being somewhat too rough for our author to handle, he left
   it quite out) bear any such sense. That the promises of the covenant
   are made originally to persons, and not to qualifications, hath been in
   part already proved, and shall be farther evinced, God assisting, as
   occasion shall be offered, in the ensuing discourse. The promises are
   to Abraham and his seed; and some of them, as hath been declared, are
   the springs of all qualifications whatever that are acceptable unto
   God. What be the qualifications of promises of opening blind eyes,
   taking away stony hearts, etc., hath not as yet been declared. But it
   is farther argued, --

   3. "That this and the like promises are to be interpreted according to
   the rule which God hath given for the interpretation and understanding
   of his threatenings unto nations about temporal things, and his
   promises that are of the same import, which we have, Jer. xviii. 7, 8,
   plainly affirming that all their accomplishment dependeth on some
   conditions in the persons or nations against whom they are denounced."

   Ans. God forbid! Shall those promises which are branches of the
   everlasting covenant of grace, called "better promises" than those of
   the old covenant, upon the account of their infallible accomplishment,
   ratified in the blood of Christ, made "yea and amen" [140] in him, the
   witness of the faithfulness of God to his church and grand supporter of
   our faith, "exceeding great and precious," [141] -- shall they be
   thought to be of no other sense and interpretation, to make no other
   revelation of the Father unto us, but in that kind which is common to
   threatenings of judgments (expressly conditional) for the deterring men
   from their impious and destructive courses? I say, God forbid! To put
   it, then, to an issue: God here promiseth that they who have trust in
   him shall never be removed. What, I pray, is the condition on which
   this promise doth depend? "It is," say they who oppose us in this, "if
   they continue trusting in him." That is, if they be not removed; for to
   trust in him is not to be removed: if, then, they be not removed, they
   shall not be removed! And is this the mind of the Holy Ghost?
   Notwithstanding all the rhetoric in the world, this promise will stand,
   for the consolation of them that believe, as the mountains about
   Jerusalem, that shall never be removed.

   In some it is said to be "a promise of abiding in happiness, not in
   faith." But it plainly appears to be a promise of abiding in trusting
   the Lord, which comprehends both our faith and happiness.

   Obj. "It is not promised that they who once trust in the Lord shall
   abide happy though they cease to trust in him."

   Ans. It is a promise that they shall not cease to trust in him.

   Obj. "It is not said that they shall be necessitated to abide trusting
   in him."

   Ans. No; but it is that they shall be so far assisted and effectually
   wrought upon as certainly to do it.

   Obj. "It is no more than the apostle says to the Corinthians, 2 Cor.
   ii. 3; which frame towards them he would not continue should they be
   changed and turned into idolaters and blasphemers."

   Ans. 1. The promises of God and the affections of men are but ill
   compared. 2. Paul loved the Corinthians whilst they were such as he
   mentioned. God promiseth his grace to believers, that they may continue
   such as he loves.

   Obj. "All the promises are made to qualifications, not to persons."

   Ans. Prove that, and, 1. Take the case in hand; and, 2. Cast down the
   church to the ground, it having no one promise, on that account, made
   unto it, as consisting of Abraham's seed.

   And so this witness also is freed from all exceptions put in against
   it, and appears with confidence to give in its testimony to the
   unchangeableness of God unto believers.

   I shall, in the next place, adjoin another portion of Scripture, of the
   same import with those foregoing, wherein the truth in hand is no less
   clearly, and somewhat more pathetically and convincingly, expressed
   than in that last mentioned. It is Isa. liv. 7-10, "For a small moment
   have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a
   little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting
   kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. For
   this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the
   waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I
   would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For the mountains shall
   depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from
   thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord
   that hath mercy on thee." This place I have mentioned before, but only
   as to one special inference from one passage in the words; I shall now
   use the whole for the confirmation of the general truth we plead for.
   The words are full, plain, suited to the business in hand. No
   expressions of our finding out can so fully reach the truth we assert,
   much less so pathetically work upon the affections of believers, or so
   effectually prevail on their understandings to receive the truth
   contained in them, as these words of God himself, given us for these
   ends, are suited to do. Go to men whose minds are in any measure free
   from prejudice, not forestalled with a contrary persuasion or furnished
   with evasions for the defence of their opinions, and ask whether God
   doth not in these words directly and positively promise to those to
   whom he speaketh, that he will always continue his kindness to them to
   the end, and that for the days of eternity his love shall be fixed on
   them; and I no way doubt but they will readily answer, "It is so
   indeed; it cannot be denied." But seeing we have to deal, as with our
   own unbelieving hearts, so with men who have turned every stone to
   prejudge this testimony of God, the words must a little more narrowly
   be considered, and the mind of the Holy Ghost inquired into.

   Verse 7, mention is made of the desertion of the church by the
   eclipsing of the beams of God's countenance, and the inflicting of some
   great affliction for a season; in opposition unto which momentary
   desertion, in that and in the beginning of the 8th verse, he giveth in
   consolation from the assurance of the great mercies and everlasting
   kindness wherein he abideth to do them good: "With everlasting kindness
   will I have mercy on thee;" -- "I will pardon, pity, and heal thee with
   that mercy which floweth from love, which never had beginning, that
   never shall have ending, that cannot be cut off, everlasting kindness'
   Bear with patience your present desertion, your present trials,
   whatever they are that befall you; they are but for a season, but for a
   moment,' and these also are consistent with that mercy and kindness
   which is everlasting and turneth not away." If this mercy and kindness
   dependeth on any thing in us, and is solved lastly thereinto, which may
   alter and change every moment, -- as our walking with God in itself
   considered, not relating to the unchangeableness of his purpose and the
   efficacy of his promised grace, is apt to do, -- what opposition can
   there be betwixt that desertion wherewith they are exercised and the
   kindness wherewith they are embraced, as to their continuance? As that
   is said to be for a little while, for "a moment," so this also may be
   of no longer abode. It may possibly be as Jonah's gourd, that grew up
   in the morning, and before night was withered. What, then, shall become
   of the foundation of that consolation wherewith God here refresheth the
   souls of his people, consisting in the continuance of his kindness in
   an antithesis to the momentariness of their desertion?

   Lest that any should call this into question (as our unbelieving hearts
   are very apt and skilful in putting in pleas against the truth of the
   promises of God and their accomplishment towards us), verse 9, the Lord
   farther confirmeth the assurance formerly given, and removeth those
   objections to which, through the sophistry of Satan and the sottishness
   of our own hearts, it may seem to be liable. "This is," saith he, "as
   the waters of Noah." God's dealing with them in that mercy which
   floweth from his everlasting kindness is like his dealing with the
   world in the matter of the waters of Noah, or the flood wherewith it
   was drowned and destroyed, when he, with his, were saved in the ark. He
   calleth upon his children to consider his dealings with the world in
   respect of the flood: "I have sworn," saith he (that is, "I have
   entered into a covenant to that end," which was wont to be confirmed
   with an oath, and God being absolutely faithful in his covenant is said
   to swear thereunto, though there be no express mention of any such
   oath), "that the world should no more be so drowned as then it was.
   Now," saith God, "see my faithfulness herein; it hath never been
   drowned since, nor ever shall be. With equal faithfulness have I
   engaged, even in covenant, that that kindness which I mentioned to thee
   shall always be continued, so that I will not be wroth to rebuke thee;'
   that is, so as utterly to cast thee off, as the world was when it was
   drowned." But some may say, "Before the flood the earth was filled with
   violence and sin; and should it be so again, would it not bring another
   flood upon it? Hath he said he will not drown it, notwithstanding any
   interposal of sin, wickedness, or rebellion whatsoever? Yea," saith he,
   "such is my covenant. I took notice in my first engagement therein,
   that the imagination of man's heart would be evil from his youth,' Gen.
   viii. 21, and yet I entered into that solemn covenant. So that this
   exemption of the world from a universal deluge is not an appendix to
   the obedience of the world, which hath been, upon some accounts, more
   wicked since than before (as in the crucifying of Christ, the Lord of
   glory, and in rejecting of him being preached unto them), but it solely
   leaneth upon my faithfulness in keeping covenant, and my truth in the
   accomplishment of the oath that I have solemnly entered into. So is my
   kindness to you. I have made express provision for your sins and
   failings therein; such I will preserve you from as are inconsistent
   with my kindness to you, and such will I pardon as you are overtaken
   withal." When you see a universal deluge covering the face of the earth
   (that is, God unfaithful to his oath and covenant), then, and not till
   then, suppose that his kindness can be turned from believers.

   Something is excepted against this testimony, chap. xi. sect. 4, p.
   227, but of so little importance that it is scarce worth while to turn
   aside to the consideration of it. The sum is, "That this place speaketh
   only of God's faithfulness in his covenant; but that this should be the
   tenor of the covenant, that they who once truly believe should by God
   infallibly, and by a strong hand, against all interposals of sin,
   wickedness, or rebellion, be preserved in such a faith, is not, by any
   word, syllable, or iota, intimated."

   Ans. This is that which is repeated "usque ad nauseam;" and were it not
   for variety of expressions, wherewith some men do abound, to adorn it,
   it would appear extremely beggarly and overworn. But a sorry shift (as
   they say) is better than none, or doubtless in this place it had not
   been made use of; for, --

   1. This testimony is not called forth to speak immediately to the
   continuance of believers in their faith, but to the continuance and
   unchangeableness of the love of God to them, and consequently only to
   their preservation in faith upon that account.

   2. It is not only assumed at a cheap and very low rate or price, but
   clearly gratis supposed, that believers may make such "interposals of
   sin, wickedness, and rebellion," in their walking with God, as should
   be inconsistent with the continuance of his favour and kindness to
   them, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace. His kindness and
   favour being to us extrinsical, our sins are not opposed unto them
   really and directly, as though they might effectually infringe an act
   of the will of God, but only meritoriously. Now, when God saith that he
   will continue his kindness to us for ever notwithstanding the demerit
   of sin, as is plainly intimated in that allusion to the waters of Noah,
   for any one to say that they may fall into such sins and rebellions as
   that he cannot but turn his kindness from them, is a bold attempt for
   the violation of his goodness and faithfulness, and a plain begging of
   the thing in question. Certainly it is not a pious labour, to thrust
   with violence such supposals into the promises of God as will stop
   those breasts from giving out any consolation, when no place or room
   for them doth at all appear, there being not one word, syllable, iota,
   or tittle, of any such supposals in them.

   3. The exposition and gloss that is given of these words, -- namely,
   "That upon condition of their faithfulness and obedience, which,
   notwithstanding any thing in this or any other promise, they may turn
   away from, he will engage himself to be a God to them," -- is such as
   no saint of God, without the help of Satan and his own unbelief, could
   affix to the place.

   4. Neither will that at all assist which is affirmed, namely, "That in
   all covenants, -- and his promise holdeth out a covenant, -- there must
   be a condition on both sides:" for, we willingly grant that in his
   covenant of grace God doth promise something to us, and requireth
   something of us, and that these two have mutual dependence one upon
   another; but we also affirm that in the very covenant itself God hath
   graciously promised to work effectually in us those things which he
   requireth of us, and that herein it mainly differeth from the covenant
   of works, which he hath abolished. But such a covenant as wherein God
   should promise to be a God unto us upon a condition by us and in our
   own strength to be fulfilled, and on the same account continued in unto
   the end, we acknowledge not, nor can, whilst our hearts have any sense
   of the love of the Father, the blood of the Son, or the grace of the
   Holy Spirit, the fountains thereof. Notwithstanding, then, any thing
   that hath been drawn forth in opposition to it, faith may triumph, from
   the love of God in Christ, held out in this promise, in the full
   assurance of an everlasting acceptance with him; for God, also, willing
   yet more abundantly to give in consolation in this place to the heirs
   of promise, assureth the stability of his love and kindness to them by
   another allusion: Verse 10, "The mountains," saith he, "shall depart,
   and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee,
   neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that
   hath mercy on thee." He biddeth them consider the mountains and hills,
   and suppose that they may be removed and depart. "Suppose that the most
   unlikely things in the world shall come to pass, whose accomplishment
   none can judge possible while the world endureth, yet my kindness to
   thee is such as shall not fall within those supposals which concern
   things of such an impossibility." I am exceeding conscious that all
   paraphrasing or exposition of the words that may be used, for their
   accommodation to the truth we plead for, doth but darken and eclipse
   the light and glory which in and by themselves, to a believing soul,
   they cast upon it. Now, lest any should think that there is the least
   tendency in such promises as these, as held out to believers, to turn
   them aside from close walking with God, before I enter upon the
   consideration of any other (this seeming of all others most exposed to
   exceptions of that nature), I shall give some few observations that may
   a little direct believers, to whom I write, and for whose sake this
   task is undertaken, unto the right improvement of them.

   The genuine influence which this and the like promises have upon the
   souls of the saints, is mightily to stir them up unto, and to assist
   them in answering, what lieth in them, that inexpressible love and
   kindness which their God and Father in Jesus Christ holdeth out unto
   their hearts in them. This the apostle inferreth from them, 2 Cor. vii.
   1, "Having these promises" (that is, those especially mentioned in the
   words preceding the conclusion and the inference the apostle here
   maketh, chap. vi. 16, 18, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and
   will be a Father unto them, and they shall be my sons and daughters"),
   therefore, saith he, "let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of
   the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
   Universal purity, holiness, and close walking with God, are that which
   these promises do press unto and naturally promote in the hearts of
   believers. And in 2 Pet. i. 3-6, that apostle pursueth the same at
   large, "God hath called us to glory and virtue; hath given us exceeding
   great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the
   divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
   through lust. Besides this, giving all diligence," etc. "The exceeding
   great and precious promises" which are given unto us in our calling are
   bestowed for this end, that "by them we may be made partakers of the
   divine nature." They have no tendency to communicate to us the nature
   of the devil, and to stir us up to rebellion, uncleanness, and hatred
   of the God of all that love that is in them; but lie, indeed, at the
   bottom, the root, and foundation of the practice and exercise of all
   those graces which he enumerates, and, from the receiving of those
   promises, exhorts us to in the following verses. Some, I confess, do or
   may "turn the grace of God into lasciviousness," -- that is, the
   doctrine of grace and of pardon of sin in the blood of Jesus Christ, --
   and so the mercy mentioned in such promises as these, merely as in them
   it is mentioned; grace and mercy communicated cannot be turned into
   wantonness. But what are they that do so? "Ungodly men, men of old
   ordained to condemnation," Jude 4. Paul rejecteth any such thought from
   the hearts of believers: Rom. vi. 1, 2, "Shall we continue in sin that
   grace may abound? God forbid!" Nay, suppose that that natural
   corruption, that flesh and blood, that is in believers, be apt to make
   such a conclusion as this, "Because God will certainly abide with us
   for ever, therefore let us walk carelessly, and do him all the despite
   we can," these promises being not made for the use and exalting of the
   flesh, but being given to be mixed with faith, which is carefully to
   watch against all abusing or corrupting of that love and mercy which is
   held out unto it, flesh and blood can have no advantage given unto it
   thereby; as shall afterward be more fully and clearly demonstrated. The
   question is, then, what conclusion faith doth, will, and ought to make
   of these promises of God, and not what abuse the flesh will make of
   them. Let, then, the meanest and weakest faith in all the world that is
   true and saving speak for itself, whether there be any thing in the
   nature of it that is apt to make such conclusions as these: "My God and
   Father in Jesus Christ hath graciously promised, in his infinite love
   and goodness to me, through him in whom he is well pleased, that he
   will be my God and guide for ever, that he will never forsake me, nor
   take his kindness from me to eternity. And he hath done this although
   that he saw and knew that I would deal foolishly and treacherously,
   that I would stand in need of all his goodness, patience, and mercy, to
   spare me and heal me, promising also to keep me from such a wicked
   departure from him as should for ever alienate my soul from him:
   therefore come on, let me continue in sin; let me do him all the
   dishonour and despite that I can. This is all the sense that I have of
   his infinite love, this is all the impression that it leaveth upon me,
   that I need not love him again, but study to be as vile and as
   abominable in his sight as can possibly be imagined." Certainly there
   is not any "smoking flax," or any "bruised reed," there is not a soul
   in the world whom God in Christ hath once shined upon, or dropped the
   least dram of grace into his heart, but will look on such a conclusion
   as this as a blast of the bottomless pit, a detestable dart of Satan,
   which it is as proper for faith to quench as any other abomination
   whatever. Let, then, faith in reference unto these promises have its
   perfect work, not abiding in a naked contemplation of them, but mixing
   them with itself, and there will be undoubtedly found the improvement
   before mentioned for the carrying on of godliness and gospel obedience
   in the hearts of believers. But this I shall have occasion to speak to
   more afterward.

   Hos. ii. 19, 20, is pertinent also to the same purpose: "I will betroth
   thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in
   righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.
   I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know
   the Lord." The words themselves as they tie in the text do directly
   confirm our assertion. The relation whereinto God here expresseth that
   he will and doth take his people is one of the most near and eminent
   which he affordeth to them, a conjugal relation, -- he is and will be
   their husband; which is as high an expression of the covenant betwixt
   God and his saints as any that is or can be used. Of all covenants that
   are between sundry persons, that which is between man and wife is the
   strongest and most inviolable. So is this covenant expressed Isa. liv.
   5, "Thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name." And
   this relation he affirmeth shall continue for ever, upon the account of
   those properties of his which are engaged in this his gracious
   undertaking to take them to himself therein. He doth it "in
   righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies,
   and in faithfulness." So that if there be not something in the context
   or words adjoining that shall with a high hand turn us aside from the
   first, immediate, open, and full sense of these words, the case is
   undoubtedly concluded in them. This, then, we shall consider, and
   therefore must look a little back into the general design of the whole
   chapter, for the evasion of "qualifications" will not here serve; God
   betrothed persons, not qualifications.

   There are two parts of the chapter:-- 1. That from the beginning to
   verse 14 containeth a most fearful and dreadful commination and
   threatening of the judgments of the Lord against the whole church and
   commonwealth of the Jews, for their apostasy, idolatry, and rebellion
   against him. It is not an affliction or a trial, or some lesser
   desolation, that God here threateneth them withal, but utter
   destruction and rejection as to all church and political state. He will
   leave them neither substance nor ornament, state nor worship,
   describing the condition which came upon them at their rejection of the
   Lord Jesus Christ. Left they must be as in the day that God first
   looked on them, -- poor, naked, in their blood, unpitied, formed
   neither into church-state nor commonwealth. "So will I make them,"
   saith the Lord. And this dispensation of God the prophet expresseth
   with great dread and terror to the end of verse 13.

   2. The, second part of the chapter is taken up and spent, from verse 14
   to the end, in heavenly and gracious promises of the conversion of the
   true Israelites, the seed according to the promise of God, of the
   renovation of the covenant with them, and blessing them with all
   spiritual blessings in Jesus Christ unto the end. And hereof there are
   these four parts:--

   (1.) A heavenly promise of their conversion by the gospel; which he
   demonstrateth and setteth out by comparing the spiritual deliverance
   therein to the deliverance which they had by a high hand from Egypt,
   verses 14, 15.

   (2.) The delivery of them so converted from idolatry, false worship,
   and all those ways whereby God was provoked to cast off their
   forefathers, attended by their obedience in close walking with God for
   ever, verses 16, 17.

   (3.) The quietness and peace which they shall enjoy, being called and
   purged from their sins before mentioned; which the Lord expresseth by
   his making a covenant with the whole creation in their behalf, verse
   18.

   (4.) A discovery of the fountain of the mercies before mentioned, with
   those also which afterward are insisted on, to wit, the everlasting
   covenant of grace, through which God will with all faithfulness and
   mercy take them to himself, verses 19, 20, to the end.

   Before we farther open these particulars, some objections must be
   removed that are laid to prevent the inference intended from these
   words, chap. xi. sect. 8, p. 229. It is objected, --

   1. "The promise of the betrothing here specified is made unto the
   entire body and nation of the Jews, as well unbelievers as believers,
   as appeareth by the carriage of the chapter throughout."

   Ans. The "carriage of the chapter throughout" is a weak proof of this
   assertion, and no doubt fixed on for want of particular instances to
   give any light unto it. Neither doth the "carriage of the chapter
   throughout" intimate any such thing in the least, but expressly
   manifesteth the contrary. It is universal desolation and utter
   rejection that is assigned as the portion of unbelievers as such all
   along this chapter. This promise is made to them whom "God allureth
   into the wilderness, and there speaketh comfortably to them;" which,
   what it doth import, shall be afterward considered. Yea, and which is
   more, the words of verse 23, which run on in the same tenor with the
   promises particularly insisted on, and beyond all exception are spoken
   to and of the same persons, are applied by the apostle Paul, not to the
   whole nation of the Jews, idolaters and unbelievers, but to them that
   were brought in unto the Lord Christ, and obtained the righteousness of
   faith, when the rest were hardened, Rom. ix. 26. From verse 24 to verse
   29, the apostle, by sundry instances from the scriptures of the Old
   Testament, manifesteth that it was a remnant of Israel "according to
   the election of grace" to whom the promise was made: "To us, whom God
   hath called, not to the Jews only, but also to the Gentiles; for so,"
   saith he, "it is in Osee" (instancing in the passage we insist on), "I
   will call them my people which were not my people; and her beloved
   which was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place
   where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be
   called the children of the living God;" -- which he farther confirmeth
   by a testimony out of Isa. x. 22, 23, manifesting that it is but "a
   remnant" that is intended. Wherefore it is objected, --

   2. "That the promise is conditional, and the performance of it and of
   the mercies mentioned in it suspended upon the repentance of that
   people, especially of their idolatry, to the true and pure worship of
   God, as appeareth, verses 14, 16, 17; which plainly showeth that it was
   made as well, nay, rather to those that were wicked and idolatrous
   amongst this people than unto others, as being held forth unto them
   chiefly for this end, to woo them away from their idols unto God."

   Ans. I hope the people of God will mere steadfastly abide by their
   interest in the sweetness, usefulness, and consolation of this promise,
   than to throw it away upon such slight and atheological flourishes;
   for, --

   1. Is there any tittle, iota, or word, in the whole text, to intimate
   that this promise is conditional, and dependeth on the people's
   forsaking their idolatry? The 14th, 16th, and 17th verses are urged for
   proof thereof. God, indeed, in these verses doth graciously promise
   that, from the riches of the same grace whence he freely saith that "he
   will betroth them to himself," he will convert them, and turn them away
   from their idolatry and all their sins; but that that should be
   required of them as a condition whereon God will enter into covenant
   with them, there is nothing in the whole context, from verse 14 and
   downwards, that intimateth it in the least or will endure to he wrested
   to any such sense, it holding out several distinct acts of the same
   free grace of his unto his people.

   2. That this is a promise of entering into covenant with them cannot be
   denied. Now, that God should require their repentance as an
   antecedaneous, previous qualification to his receiving them into
   covenant, and yet in the covenant undertake to give them that
   repentance, as he doth in promising them to take away their hearts of
   stone and give them new hearts of flesh, is a direct contradiction, fit
   only for a part of that divinity which is in the whole an express
   contradiction to the word and mind of God.

   3. Neither can it be supposed as a conditional promise, held out to
   them as a motive to work them from their idolatry, when, antecedently
   thereunto, God hath expressly promised to do that for them (verses 16,
   17) with as high a hand and efficacy of grace as can be well expressed.

   Wherefore, these being exceptions expressly against the scope of the
   whole, it is objected, --

   3. "That it cannot be proved that this promise properly or directly
   intendeth the collation of spiritual or heavenly good things unto them,
   so as of temporal; yea, the situation of it betwixt temporal promises
   immediately both behind and before it persuadeth the contrary. Read the
   context from verse 8 to the end of the chapter."

   Ans. The other forts being demolished, this last is very faintly
   defended, -- "It cannot be proved that it doth so properly or
   directly." But if it doth intend spirituals properly and directly,
   though not so properly or directly, the case is clear. And that it doth
   properly intend spirituals, and but secondarily and indirectly
   temporals, as to sundry limitations, is most evident; for, --

   1. The very conjugal expression of the love of God here used
   manifesteth it beyond all contradiction to be a promise of the
   covenant: "I will betroth thee unto me;" -- "I will take thee unto me
   in wedlock covenant." What! in temporal mercies? is that the tenor of
   the covenant of God? God forbid!

   2. The foundations of these mercies, and the principles from whence
   they flow, are "loving-kindness," and "mercies," and "faithfulness" in
   God, which are fixed upon them and engaged unto them whom he thus
   taketh into covenant; and surely they are spiritual mercies.

   3. The mercies mentioned are such as never had a literal accomplishment
   to the Jews in temporals, nor can have; and when things promised exceed
   all accomplishment as to the outward and temporal part, it is the
   spiritual that is principally and mainly intended. And such are these,
   verse 18, "I will break the bow, and the sword, and the battle out of
   the earth, and make them to lie down safely." How, I pray, was this
   fulfilled towards them, whilst they lived under the power of the
   Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires, to their utter desolation? And
   verse 23, he telleth them that he will "sow them unto himself in the
   earth, and have mercy upon them;" which, as I said before, Paul himself
   interpreteth and applieth to the special mercies of faith and
   justification in the blood of Christ. So that both the verses going
   before and those that follow after, to the consideration whereof we are
   sent, contain directly and properly spiritual mercies, though expressed
   in words and terms of things of a temporal importance.

   Thus, notwithstanding any exception to the contrary, the context is
   clear, as it was at first proposed. Let us, then, in the next place,
   consider the intendment of God in this promise, with that influence of
   demonstration which it hath upon the truth we are in the consideration
   of, and then free the words from that corrupting gloss which is
   endeavoured to be put upon them.

   In the first [place] I shall consider, -- 1. The persons to whom this
   promise is made; 2. The nature of the promise itself; 3. The great
   undertaking and engagement of the properties of God for the
   accomplishment of his promise.

   1. The persons here intimated are such as are under the power and
   enjoyment of the grace and kindness mentioned in verses 14-18. Now,
   because a right understanding of the grace of those promises addeth
   much to the apprehension of the kindness of these particulars insisted
   on, the opening of those words may be thought necessary.

   Verse 14, they are those whom God "allureth into the wilderness," and
   "speaketh comfortably unto them;" he allureth and persuadeth them.
   There is an allusion in the words to the great original promise of the
   conversion of the Gentiles, and the way whereby it shall be done. Gen.
   ix. 27, God persuades Japheth to dwell in the tents of Shem. Their
   alluring is by the powerful and sweet persuasion of the gospel; which
   here is so termed to begin the allegory of betrothing and marriage,
   which is afterward pursued. It is God's beginning to woo the soul by
   his ambassadors. God persuadeth them into the wilderness, -- persuadeth
   them, but yet with mighty power, as he carried them of old out of
   Egypt; for thereunto he evidently alludeth, as in the next verse is
   more fully expressed. Now, the wilderness condition whereinto they are
   allured or persuaded by the gospel compriseth two things:-- (1.)
   Separation; (2.) Entanglement.

   (1.) Separation. As the Israelites in the wilderness were separated
   from the residue of the world and the pleasures thereof, "the people
   dwelling alone, being not reckoned among the nations," having nothing
   to do with them, so God separateth them to the love of the gospel from
   their carnal contentments, and all the satisfactions which before they
   received in their lusts, until they say to them, "Get you hence; what
   have we to do with you any more?" They are separated from the practice
   of them, and made willing to bid them everlastingly farewell. They see
   their Egyptian lusts lie slain or dead, or at least dying, by the cross
   of Christ, and desire to see them no more.

   (2.) Entanglement, as the Israelites were in the wilderness. They knew
   not what to do, nor which way to take one step, but only as God went
   before them, as he took them by the hand, and taught them to go. God
   bringeth them into a lost condition; they know not what to do, nor
   which way to take, nor what course to pitch upon. And yet in this
   wilderness state, God doth commonly stir up such gracious dispositions
   of soul in them as himself is exceedingly delighted withal: hence he
   doth peculiarly call this time "a time of love," which he remembereth
   with much delight. All the time of the saint's walking with him, he
   taketh not greater delight in a soul, when it cometh to its highest
   peace and fullest assurance, than when it is seeking after him in its
   wilderness entanglement. So he expresseth it, Jer. ii. 2, "Thus saith
   the Lord; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine
   espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that
   was not sown" And what he here affirmeth holds proportion therewithal.
   The time of their being in the wilderness was the time of their
   espousals, and so it is here the time of the Lord's betrothing the soul
   to himself, the wooing words whereby he doth it being intimated in the
   next verse; for, --

   [1.] He "speaketh comfortably to them," speaketh to their hearts good
   words, that may satisfy their spirits and give them rest and
   deliverance out of that condition. What it is that God speaketh, when
   he speaketh comfortably to the very hearts of poor souls, he telleth
   you, Isa. xl. 1, 2, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
   Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare
   is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned." It is the pardon of
   iniquity that inwrappeth all the consolation that a poor wilderness
   soul, separated and entangled, is capable of or doth desire. And this
   is the first description of the persons to whom this promise is given:
   They are such as God hath humbled and pardoned, such as he hath
   converted and justified, whom he hath allured into the wilderness, and
   there spoken comfortably to them.

   [2.] Verse 15, the Lord promiseth to this called and justified people
   plenty of spiritual, gospel mercies, which he shadoweth out with
   typical expressions of temporal enjoyments, and that with allusion to
   their deliverance of old from Egypt, in three particulars:--

   1st. In general, he will give them "vineyards from thence" (that is,
   from the wilderness), as he did to them in Canaan, when he brought them
   out of the wilderness. This God often mindeth them of, that he gave
   them "vineyards which they planted not," Deut. vi. 11; and he here
   setteth out the plenty of gospel grace, which they never laboured for,
   which he had provided for them, under that notion. He giveth them of
   the wine of the gospel, his Holy Spirit.

   2dly. In particular, he compares his dealings with them to his dealings
   in the valley of Achor, a most pleasant and fruitful valley that was
   near Jericho, being the first the Israelites entered into when they
   came out of the wilderness, which is mentioned as a fruitful place,
   Isa. lxv. 10. And therefore this is said to be to them "a door of
   hope," or an entrance into that which they hoped for, it being the
   first fat, fruitful, and fertile place that the Israelites came into in
   the land of Canaan, and so an entrance into the good land which they
   hoped for, answering their expectation to the uttermost. In the promise
   of the abundance of spiritual mercies and grace which God hath prepared
   for his, he recalleth into their minds the consideration of the
   refreshment which the Israelites, after so long an abode in the "waste
   and howling wilderness," had and took in the fruitful, plenteous
   "valley of Achor." Such is the spiritual provision that God hath made
   for the entertainment of poor souls whom he hath allured into the
   wilderness, and there spoken comfortably to them. Being called and
   pardoned, he leadeth them to sweet and pleasant pastures, treasures of
   grace and mercy, which he hath laid up for them in Jesus Christ. He
   giveth them of the first-fruits of heaven, which is a door of hope unto
   the full possession, Rom. viii. 23.

   3dly. [He alludes] to the songs and rejoicings which the church had
   when they sung one to another upon the destruction of the Egyptians, at
   their delivery out of the bondage of Egypt. As then they sung for joy,
   Exod. xv. 1-21, upon the sense of that great and wonderful deliverance
   which God had wrought for them, so shall their hearts be affected with
   gospel mercies, pardoning, healing, purging, and comforting grace,
   which in Jesus Christ he will give in unto them.

   These, then, are the three things which are promised to them that come
   out of the wilderness:-- (1.) Gospel refreshment, in pouring out of the
   Spirit upon them; (2.) The first-fruits of heaven, a door of hope; (3.)
   Spiritual joy, in the destruction and conquest of sin.

   This, then, is the sum of this second part of that description which we
   have of those persons to whom the promise under consideration is given:
   They are such as, being called and pardoned, are admitted to that
   portion in the wonderful marvellous provision of gospel mercies and
   grace which in Jesus Christ he hath provided for them, with that joy
   and consolation which thereon doth ensue.

   In the following verses you have a fuller description of these persons,
   upon a twofold account:-- First, By their delivery from idolatry and
   false worship, verses 16, 17, which is particularly and peculiarly
   insisted on, because that eminently was the sin for which those
   mentioned in the beginning of the chapter were utterly rejected. God
   will preserve these, as from the sin of idolatry, so from any other
   that should procure their utter rejection and desolation, as that of
   idolatry had formerly done in respect of the only carnal Jews.
   Secondly, By their protection against their enemies, verse 18. And
   these are the persons to whom this promise is made, -- converted,
   justified, sanctified, and purified persons.

   2. We may take a little view of the nature of the promise itself: "I
   will," saith the Lord, "betroth thee unto me for ever." There is in
   this promise a twofold opposition to that rejection that God had before
   denounced unto the carnal and rebellious Jews:--

   (1.) In the nature of the thing itself, unto the divorce that God gave
   them: Verse 2, "She is not my wife; neither am I her husband." But to
   these saith God, "I will betroth them unto myself;" -- "They shall
   become a wife to me, and I will be a husband unto them." And this also
   manifesteth that they are not the same persons to whom that threatening
   was given that are principally intended in this promise; for if God did
   only take them again whom he had once put away, there would have been
   no need of any betrothing of them anew. New "sponsalia" are not
   required for such an action.

   (2.) In the continuance of the rejection of the first, and the
   establishment of the reception of the latter, at least in respect of
   his abiding with these and those; with those for a season, but unto
   these he saith, "I will betroth them unto me for ever." God's
   betrothing of believers is his actual taking them into a marriage
   covenant with himself, to deal with them in the tenderness,
   faithfulness, and protection of a husband. So is he often pleased to
   call himself in reference to his church. I shall not go forth to the
   consideration of this relation that God is pleased to take the souls of
   saints into with himself. The eminent and precious usefulness and
   consolation that floweth from it is ready to draw me out thereunto, but
   I must attend to that which I principally aim at, -- namely, to evince
   that God hath undertaken that he and believers will and shall abide in
   this relation to the end, that he will for ever be a husband to them,
   and that in opposition to his dealing with the carnal church of the
   Jews, to whom he was betrothed as to ordinances, but rejected them, and
   said he was not their husband as to peculiar grace. To whom God
   continueth to be a husband, to them he continueth the loving-kindness,
   good-will, and protection of a husband, -- the most intense, useful,
   fruitful, that can be imagined. This, then, will he do to believers,
   and that for ever.

   3. Now, because sundry objections may be levied against the
   accomplishment of this engagement of God, upon the account of our
   instability and backsliding, the Lord addeth the manner of his entering
   into this engagement with us, obviating and preventing, or removing,
   all such objections whatever; which is the third thing proposed to
   consideration, -- namely, the engagement of the properties of God for
   the accomplishment of this promise.

   Five properties doth the Lord here mention, to assure us of his
   constancy in this undertaking of his grace, and of the steadfastness of
   the covenant he hath taken his people into; and they are,
   "righteousness, judgment, loving-kindness, mercies," and
   "faithfulness;" whose efficacy, also, in reference unto their abiding
   with him whom he doth betroth to himself, he mentioneth in the close of
   verse 20, "Thou," saith he, "shalt know the Lord." I shall not insist
   on the particular importance of the several expressions whereby the
   Lord hath set forth himself and his goodness here unto us. It is plain
   that they are all mentioned to the same end and purpose, -- namely, to
   give assurance unto us of the unchangeableness of this work of his
   grace, and to prevent the objections which the fears of our unbelieving
   hearts, from the consideration of our weaknesses, ways, and walkings,
   temptations, trials, and troubles, would raise upon it. The Lord, when
   he betroths us to himself, sees and knows what we are, what we will be,
   and how we will provoke the eyes of his glory. He sees that if we
   should be left unto ourselves, we would utterly cast off all knowledge
   of him and obedience unto him. "Wherefore," saith he, "?I will betroth
   thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment;' allowing full measure
   for all thy weaknesses, that they shall not dissolve that union I
   intend." As if a prince should go to take to him in marriage a poor
   deformed beggar, who being amazed with his kindness, and fearing much
   lest he should be mistaken, and account her otherwise than indeed she
   is, which when it is discovered will be her ruin, she plainly telleth
   him she is poor, deformed, and hath nothing in the world that may
   answer his expectation, and therefore she cannot but fear that when he
   knoweth her thoroughly indeed, he will utterly cast her off: but he
   thereupon replieth, "Fear no such thing; what I do, I do in
   righteousness and judgment, knowingly of thee and thy condition, and so
   as that. I will abide by it." Perhaps, as some think, by this
   "betrothing us in righteousness," the Lord may intimate his bestowing
   upon us righteousness, yea, his becoming in Jesus Christ our
   righteousness, to supply that utter want which is in us of that which
   is acceptable unto him, Isa. xlv. 24. Now, because we are not only
   unmeet to be at first accepted into any such terms of alliance with the
   Lord, but also shall certainly in the carrying of it on behave
   ourselves foolishly and frowardly, unanswerable to his loving-kindness,
   so that he may justly cast us off for ever, he telleth us farther that
   he betroths us to himself "in loving-kindness and in mercies," knowing
   that in entering into this alliance with us he maketh work for his
   tenderest bowels of compassion, his pity and pardoning mercy. In his
   continuance in this relation, whatever his kindness, patience, and
   pardoning mercy can be extended unto, that he will accomplish and bring
   about. But will not the Lord, when he pardons once and again, at length
   be wearied by our innumerable provocations, so as to cast us off for
   ever? "No," saith he; "this will I do in faithfulness." He doubleth the
   expression of his grace, and addeth a property of his nature that will
   carry him out to abide by his first love to the utmost: "I will," saith
   he, "even betroth thee unto myself in faithfulness" His firmness,
   constancy, and truth, in all his ways and promises, will he use in this
   work of his grace, Deut. xxxii. 4. But perhaps, notwithstanding all
   this, the heart is not yet quiet, but it feareth itself and its own
   treachery, lest it should utterly fall off from this gracious husband;
   wherefore, in the close of all, God undertaketh for them also that no
   scruple may remain why our souls should not be satisfied with the
   sincere milk that floweth from this breast of consolation. "Thou
   shalt," saith he, "know the Lord." This, indeed, is required, that
   under the accomplishment of this gracious promise you know the Lord, --
   that is, believe and trust, and obey the Lord; and saith he, "Thou
   shalt do it. I will by my grace keep alive in thy heart (as a fruit of
   that love wherewith I have betrothed thee to myself) that knowledge,
   faith, and obedience, which I require of thee."

   This, then, is some part of that which in this promise the Lord holdeth
   out unto us and assureth us of. Notwithstanding his rejection of the
   carnal Jews, yet for his elect, both the Jews and Gentiles, he will so
   take them into a marriage covenant with himself that he will continue
   for ever a husband unto them, undertaking also that they shall continue
   in faith and obedience, knowing him all their days. And of all this he
   effectually assureth them upon the account of his righteousness,
   judgment, loving-kindness, mercy, and faithfulness.

   I cannot but add, that if there were no other place of Scripture in the
   whole book of God to confirm the truth we have in hand but only this, I
   should not doubt (the Lord assisting) to close with it upon the signal
   testimony given unto it thereby, notwithstanding all the specious
   oppositions that are made thereunto.

   For the close, I shall a little consider that lean and hungry
   exposition of these words which is given in the place before mentioned,
   chap. xi. sect. 8, p. 229, "I will betroth them unto me in
   righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and mercy." So
   the words are expressed, in a different character, as the very words of
   the promise in the text:-- "Thee," that is, the church, is changed into
   "Them," -- that is, the Jews and their children or carnal seed, as a
   little before was expressed; and then that emphatical expression, "for
   ever," is quite thrust out of the text, as a stubborn word, not to be
   dealt withal upon any fair terms. Let us see, then, how that which
   remaineth is treated and turned off. "?I will betroth thee;' that is, I
   will engage and attempt to insure both them and their affections to me,
   by all variety of ways and means that are proper and likely to bring
   such a thing to pass.'?" But who knoweth not that this is wooing, and
   not betrothing? We need not go far to find out men learned in the law
   to inform us that to try and attempt to get and assure the affections
   of any one is not a betrothment. This, then, is the first part of this
   exposition: "?I will betroth;' that is, I will woo and essay, attempt
   and endeavour, to get their affections;'?" which, besides the
   forementioned absurdity, is attended with another sore oversight, to
   wit, that God promiseth to do this very thing in the last words of
   verse 20, which is affirmed that he doth but attempt to do.

   To proceed: He saith, "I will do this, by showing myself just and
   righteous unto them, in keeping my promise concerning their deliverance
   out of captivity at the end of seventy years." So, then, in this new
   paraphrase, "I will betroth thee" (that is, the election of Jews and
   Gentiles) "to myself for ever in righteousness," is, "I will essay to
   get their affections by showing myself righteous in the promise of
   bringing the Jews out of captivity." That this promise is not made to
   the body of the Jews returning out of captivity was before
   demonstrated. The righteousness here mentioned is that which God will
   and doth exercise in this very act of betrothing, and not any other act
   of it, which he will make use of to that purpose. God engageth to
   betroth them to himself in righteousness, using and exercising his
   righteousness in that very set of his love and grace to them; and this
   is now given in an alluring them to love him by appearing righteous in
   bringing them out of captivity!

   The like interpretation is given of the other expressions following:
   "?Judgment,' -- it is," saith he, "by punishing and judging their
   enemies, and destroying them that led them into captivity, and held
   them in bondage and subjection; and loving-kindness' is his giving them
   corn, wine, oil, peace, and plenty; and mercy,' in pardoning of daily
   sins and infirmities; and faithfulness' is" he knoweth not what. This
   is made the sum of all: "God, by doing them good with outward mercies,
   and pardoning some sins and infirmities, will morally try to get their
   affections to himself." "Virgula Pictoris!" 1. It is not an expression
   of God's attempting to get their love, but of the establishing and
   confirming of his own. 2. That God should morally try and essay to do
   and effect or bring about any thing, which yet he doth not, will not,
   or cannot, compass and effect, is not to be ascribed to him without
   casting the greatest reproach of impotency, ignorance, changeableness,
   upon him imaginable. 3. God promising to betroth us to himself, fixing
   his love on us that we shall know him, so fixing our hearts on him; to
   say that this holdeth out only the use of some outward means unto us,
   enervateth the whole covenant of his grace wrapped up in these
   expressions. So that, all things considered, it is not a little strange
   to me that any sober, learned man should ever be tempted so to wrest
   and corrupt, by wrested and forced glosses, the plain words of
   Scripture, wherein, whatever is pretended, he cannot have the least
   countenance of any expositor of note that went before him. Although we
   are not to be pressed with the name of Tarnovius, a Lutheran, a
   professed adversary in this cause, yet let his exposition of that place
   under consideration be consulted with, and it will plainly appear that
   it abideth not in any compliance with that which is here by our author
   imposed on us.

   The promises we have under consideration looking immediately and
   directly only to one part of that doctrine whose defence we have
   undertaken, -- to wit, the constancy and unchangeableness of the grace
   of justification, or God's abiding with his saints, as to his free
   acceptance of them and love unto them, unto the end, -- I shall not
   insist on many more particulars.

   John x. 27-29 closeth this discourse. "My sheep hear my voice, and I
   know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and
   they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my
   hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is
   able to pluck them out of my Father's hand."

   In the verse foregoing, our Saviour renders a reason why the Pharisees,
   notwithstanding all his preaching to them and the miracles he wrought
   among them, yet believed not, when sundry others, to whom the same
   dispensation of outward means was afforded, did hear his voice and did
   yield obedience thereunto; and this he telleth us was because they were
   not of his sheep, such as were given him of his Father, and for whom,
   as the good Shepherd, he laid down his life, verses 14, 15. Upon the
   close of this discourse, he describeth the present condition of his
   sheep, and their preservation in that condition, from the power of
   himself and his Father engaged thereunto. He layeth their abiding with
   him as his sheep upon the omnipotence of God; which, upon account of
   the constancy of his love towards them, he will exercise and exert as
   need shall be in their behalf. There are many emphatical expressions
   both of their continuance in the obedience of faith, and of his
   undertaking for their preservation therein. The latter I at present
   only intend. Saith he, 1. "I know them;" 2. "I give them eternal life;"
   3. "They shall never perish;" 4. "No man shall pluck them out of my
   hand;" 5. "My Father is omnipotent, and hath a sovereignty over all,
   and he taketh care of them, and none shall take them out of his hand."
   It is not easy to cast these words into any other form of arguing than
   that wherein they lie, without losing much of that convincing evidence
   that is in them. This you may take for the sum of their influence into
   the truth in hand: Those whom Christ so owneth as to take upon him to
   give them eternal life, and by his power and the power of his Father to
   preserve them thereunto, -- which power shall not, nor possibly can be,
   prevailed against, so that the end aimed at to be accomplished therein
   should not be brought about, -- those shall certainly be kept for ever
   in the favour and love of God, they shall never be turned from him.
   Such is the case of all believers; for they are all the sheep of
   Christ, they all hear his voice and follow him.

   Some few things, to wrest this gracious assurance given believers of
   the everlasting good-will of God and Christ unto them, are attempted by
   Mr Goodwin, chap. x. sect. 37, p. 203.

   1. He granteth that there is an engagement of the "mighty power of God
   for the safeguarding of the saints, as such or remaining such, against
   all adverse powers whatever, but nowhere for the compelling or
   necessitating of them to persevere and continue such is there any thing
   in the Scripture."

   Ans. The sum is, "If they will continue saints, God will take care
   that, notwithstanding all opposition, they shall be saints still." Very
   well, if they will be so, they shall be so; but "that they shall
   continue to be so, that is not promised." The terms of "compelling or
   necessitating" are cast in merely to throw dirt upon the truth, lest,
   the beauty shining forth too brightly, there might have been danger
   that the very exceptor himself could not have borne it. We say not that
   God by his power compelleth men to persevere; that is, maketh them do
   it whether they will or no. Perseverance being an habitual grace in
   their wills, it is a gross contradiction once to imagine that men
   should be compelled thereunto. But this we say, that, by the almighty
   power of his Spirit and grace, he confirmeth his saints in a voluntary
   abiding with him all their days. Having made them a willing people in
   the day of the power of Christ towards them, he preserveth them unto
   the end. Neither are they wrapped up by the power of God into such a
   necessity of perseverance as should obstruct the liberty of their
   obedience, the necessity that regardeth them in that condition
   respecting only the issue and end of things, and not their manner of
   support in their abiding with God. And it is not easy to conjecture why
   our author should so studiously avoid the grant, of a promise of final
   perseverance in these words, who, in his next observation upon them,
   affirmeth that "they respect the state of the saints in heaven, and not
   at all those that are on earth;" I mean, that part of those words which
   expresseth their preservation and safeguarding by the power of God. So
   that this is fancied, perhaps, even to be the condition of the saints
   in heaven, that God will there preserve them whilst they continue
   saints, but that they shall so do there is not any assurance given or
   to be had. It is marvellous, if this be so, that in so large and vast a
   space of time we yet never heard of any of those holy ones that were
   cast out of his inheritance, or that forfeited his enjoyment. But let
   us hear what is farther asserted. He addeth, by way of answer, --

   2. "The security for which our Saviour engageth the greatness of his
   Father's power unto his sheep is promised unto them, not in order to
   the effecting or procuring their final perseverance, but rather by way
   of reward to it."

   Ans. But what tittle is there, I pray you, in the whole context to
   intimate any such thing? what insinuation of any such condition? "They
   hear my voice, and they follow me;" that is, "They believe in me, and
   bring forth the fruits of their believing in suitable obedience," as
   these words of "hearing" and "following" do imply. Saith our Saviour,
   "These shall not perish, the power of my Father shall preserve them."
   "That is," saith our author, "in case they persevere to the end, then
   God will preserve them." Clearly our Saviour under-taketh that
   believers shall not perish, and that his power and his Father's are
   engaged for that end; which is all we assert or have need to do.

   3. "That this promise of safety made to his sheep by Christ doth not
   relate to their state or condition in this present world, but to that
   of the world to come. My sheep hear my voice, and follow me;' in which
   words of hearing' and following' him he intimateth or includeth their
   perseverance, as appeareth by the words immediately following, And I
   give them eternal life.'?"

   Ans. This, I confess, is to the purpose, if it be true; but being so
   contrary to what hath been (I had almost said universally) received
   concerning the mind of Christ in this place, we had need of evident
   concluding reasons to enforce the truth of this gloss or
   interpretation. For the present, I shall give you some few inducements
   or persuasions why it seemeth altogether unsuitable to the mind of our
   blessed Saviour, that this engagement of his Father's power and his own
   should be shut out from taking any place in the kingdom of grace:--

   1. Observe that there is a great opposition to be made against the
   saints in that condition wherein they are promised to be preserved.
   This is supposed in the words themselves: "None shall pluck them out of
   my hand. My Father is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck
   them out of my Father's hand;" -- as if he should have said, "It is
   true, many enemies they have, great opposition will there be and arise
   against them on all hands, but preserved they shall be in the midst of
   them all." But now, what enemies, what opposition, will there be and
   arise against the saints in heaven? The Holy Ghost telleth us, "The
   last enemy is death," and that at the resurrection that shall be
   "utterly swallowed up in victory," that it shall never lift up the
   head; there they rest from their labours who die in the Lord. Yea, it
   is exceeding ridiculous to suppose that the saints need assurance of
   the engagement of the omnipotency of God for their safeguarding in
   heaven against all opposition, when they are assured of nothing more
   than that there they shall not be liable to the least opposition or
   obstruction in their enjoyment of God unto all eternity.

   2. Our Saviour here describeth the present condition of his sheep in a
   way of opposition to them that are not his sheep: his hear his voice,
   the others do not; and his shall be preserved when the others perish.
   The Pharisees believed not, and, as he told them, "they died in their
   sins;" his sheep heard him, and were preserved in their obedience. It
   is, then, evidently the deportment of Christ towards, and his care of,
   his sheep in this world, in a contradistinction to them who are not his
   sheep, among whom they live, that is here set forth.

   3. The very context of the words enforceth this sense: "They follow me,
   and I give unto them eternal life;" -- "I do it; that is the work I
   have in hand." Take "eternal life" in the most comprehensive sense, for
   that which is to be enjoyed in heaven (though, doubtless, it compriseth
   also the life of grace which here we enjoy, John xvii. 3), what is that
   which our Saviour undertaketh to give believers, and that they may be
   sure that they shall be preserved to the enjoyment of? When he telleth
   them they shall not perish, is that not perishing not to be cast out of
   heaven when they come thither, -- not to be deprived of eternal life
   after they have entered into the fullness of it? or rather, that they
   shall not fail or come short of it, and so perish? And this is that
   which the power of Father and Son is engaged to accomplish, -- namely,
   that believers perish not by coming short of that eternal life which is
   the business of Christ to give unto them. If any one reason of weight
   or importance that hath the least pregnancy with truth be offered to
   the contrary, we shall renounce and shake off the power of the former
   reasons which we have insisted on; though without offering the greatest
   violence imaginable to truth itself it cannot be done. It is said that
   "by these words, They hear my voice, and follow me,' Christ doth
   intimate or include their perseverance." To say a thing is "intimated
   or included" is of small power against so many express reasons as we
   have induced to the contrary. But will this be granted, that wherever
   the saints are said to hear the voice of Christ, perseverance is
   included? -- we shall quickly have a fresh supply of Scripture proofs
   for the demonstration of the truth in hand. But what attempt is made
   for the proof hereof? "It is so because the words immediately following
   are, I give unto them eternal life,' which presuppose their final
   perseverance;" and this must be so, because it is so said. "I give unto
   them eternal life," is either an intimation of what he doth for the
   present, by giving them a spiritual life in himself, or a promise he
   will do so with respect to eternal life consummated in heaven, which
   promise is everywhere made upon believing; and it is a promise of
   perseverance, not given upon perseverance. Neither is there any thing
   added in the words following to confirm this uncouth wresting of the
   mind of our Saviour, but only the assertion is repeated, "that God will
   defend them in heaven against all opposition." Here, where their
   oppositions are innumerable, they may shift for themselves; but when
   they come to heaven, where they shall be sure to meet with no
   opposition at all, there the Lord hath engaged his almighty power for
   their safety against all that shall rise up against them. And this is,
   as is said, the "natural and clear disposition of the context in this
   place;" but "Nobis non licet," etc.

   There are sundry other texts of Scripture which most clearly and
   evidently confirm the truth we have in hand, which are all well worth
   our consideration for our consolation and establishment, as also
   something of our labour anal diligence, to quit them from those glosses
   and interpretations (which turn them aside from their proper
   intendment) that are by some put upon them; amongst which, 1 Cor. i. 8,
   9; Phil. i. 6; 1 Thess. v. 24; John v. 24, ought to have place. But
   because I will not insist long on any particulars of our argument from
   the promises of God, here shall be an end.

   into the saints' perseverance -- All causes of separation between God
   and believers taken away thereby -- Moral and efficient causes thereby
   removed -- The guilt of sin, how taken away by the death of Christ --
   Of the nature of redemption -- Conscience of sin, how abolished by the
   sacrifice of Christ -- Heb. x. 3, 4, 14; Dan. ix. 24 opened -- Rom.

   law innovated in respect of the elect -- The vindictive justice of God
   satisfied by the death of Christ -- How that is done Wherein
   satisfaction doth consist; absolute, not conditional -- The law, how

   clearing of the former assertions -- Whether any one for whom Christ
   died may die in sin -- The necessity of faith and obedience -- The
   reasons thereof -- The end of faith and holiness -- The first argument

   -- The fourth -- Good things bestowed on them for whom Christ died
   antecedently to any thing spiritually good in them -- The Spirit so
   bestowed, and faith itself -- The close of those arguments --
   Inferences from the foregoing discourse -- The efficacy of the death of
   Christ, and the necessity of faith and obedience, reconciled -- Sundry
   considerations unto that end proposed: 1. All spiritual mercies fruits
   of the death of Christ; 2. All the fruits of Christ's death laid up in
   the hand of God's righteousness; 3. The state of them for whom Christ
   died not actually changed by his death; 4. On what account believing is
   necessary -- Christ secures the stability of the saints' abiding with
   God -- What is contrary thereunto; how by him removed -- The world
   overcome by Christ, as managed by Satan in an enmity to the saints --
   The complete victory of Christ over the devil -- The ways whereby he
   completes his conquest -- The rule of Satan in respect of sinners

   The Holy Spirit procured by the death of Christ -- The giving of the
   Spirit the great promise of the new covenant -- This farther proved and
   confirmed -- The perpetual residence of the Holy Spirit with believers
   proved by the threefold testimony of Father, Son, and Spirit -- Isa.
   lix. 21, the testimony of the Father proposed and vindicated -- Our
   argument from hence farther cleared -- This promise absolute, not
   conditional -- No condition rationally to be affixed to it -- The
   import of those words, "As for me" -- To whom this promise is made --
   That farther cleared -- Not to all Israel according to the flesh -- Mr
   G.'s objections answered -- The testimony of the Son given to the
   perpetual abiding of the Spirit with believers -- John xiv. 16 opened
   -- The promise in those words equally belonging to all believers -- Mr
   G.'s objections answered -- No promise of the Spirit abiding with
   believers on his principle allowed -- The promise given to the apostles
   personally, yet given also to the whole church -- Promises made to the
   church made to the individuals whereof it is constituted -- The giving
   of this promise to all believers farther argued from the scope of the
   place, and vindicated from Mr G.'s exceptions -- The third testimony,
   of the Holy Spirit himself, proposed to consideration -- His testimony
   in sealing particularly considered, 2 Cor. i. 22; Eph. i. 13, iv. 30 --
   Of the nature and use of sealing amongst men -- The end, aim, and use,
   of the sealing of the Holy Ghost -- Mr G.'s objections and exceptions
   to our argument from that sealing of the Spirit considered and removed
   -- The same farther carried on, etc.

   There remains nothing for the confirmation of the first branch or part
   of the truth proposed, but only the consideration of the oath of God;
   which, because it ought certainly to be "an end of all strife," I shall
   reserve the handling of it to the close of the whole, if God be pleased
   to carry us out thereunto, that we may give the oath of God its due
   honour, of being the last word in this contest.

   The order of our method first proposed would here call me to handle our
   steadfastness with God, and the glory created upon our grace of
   sanctification; but because some men may admire, and ask whence it is
   that the Lord will abide so steadfast in his love towards believers as
   hath been manifested upon several accounts that he will, besides what
   hath been said before of his own goodness and unchangeableness, etc., I
   shall now add that outward consideration which lies in the mediation of
   Christ, upon the account whereof he acts his own goodness and kindness
   to us with the greatest advantage of glory and honour to himself that
   can be thought upon. Only I shall desire the reader to observe, that
   the Lord Jesus is an undertaker in this business of perfecting our
   salvation and safeguarding our spiritual glory not in one regard and
   respect only. There is one part of his engagement therein which, under
   the oath of God, is the close of the whole, and that is his becoming a
   surety to us of his Father's faithfulness towards us, and a surety for
   us of our faithfulness to him: so that, upon the whole matter, the
   business on each side as to security will be found knit up in him, and
   there we shall do well to leave it, though the handling of that
   suretiship of his be not of our present consideration. Men will scarce
   dispute him out of his faithfulness. "Henceforth he dieth no more;
   death hath no dominion over him; he sits at the right hand of God,
   expecting to have his enemies made his footstool." This, then, I will
   do, if God permit. And [as] for the steadfastness of his saints in
   their abiding with God, I shall, I fear, no otherwise insist peculiarly
   upon it but as occasion shall be ministered by dealing with our
   adversary as we pass on.

   That which I shall now do is, to consider the influence of the
   priesthood of Christ in those two grand acts thereof, his oblation and
   intercession, into the perseverance of saints, according to that of the
   apostle: Heb. vii. 25, "Wherefore he is able also to save them to the
   uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
   intercession for them." And I will do it the more carefully, because
   though it be one of the greatest strengths of our cause, yet I shall
   walk in a path wherein none shall meet me, for the most part of the
   way, to make any opposition.

   My entrance into the consideration of the procurement of our glory by
   Christ shall be with that whereby he came into his own, namely, his
   oblation, which hath a twofold influence into the perseverance of the
   saints, or into the safeguarding of their salvation to the utmost:--

   I. By removing and taking out of the way all causes of separation
   between God and those that come unto God by him; [142] that is, all
   believers. Now, these are of two sorts: 1. That which is moral, and
   procuring such separation or distance, which is the guilt of sin; 2.
   That which is efficient and working, as the power of Satan and of sin;
   -- the first of these being that alone for which it may be supposed
   that God will turn from believers, and the latter that alone whereby
   they may possibly be turned from him. Now, that both these are so taken
   out of the way by the oblation of Christ that they shall never actually
   and eventually work or cause any total or final separation between God
   and believers, shall be demonstrated:--

   1. He hath so taken away the guilt of sin from believers, from them
   that come to God by him, that it shall not prevail with the Lord to
   turn from them. [143] He hath "obtained eternal redemption for us,"
   Heb. ix. 12, eternal and complete; not so far and so far, but "eternal
   redemption" hath he obtained, -- redemption that shall be completed,
   notwithstanding any interveniencies imaginable whatever. This
   redemption, which he hath obtained for us, and which by him we obtain,
   the apostle tells us what it is, and wherein it doth consist: Eph. i.
   7, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
   sins." He hath obtained for us everlasting forgiveness of sins. As to
   the complete efficiency of the procuring cause thereof, absolutely
   perfect and complete in its own kind, not depending on any condition in
   any other whatsoever for the producing the utmost effect intended in
   it, there shall be no after-reckoning or account for sin between God
   and them for whom he so obtains redemption. And the apostle, in the
   10th chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, disputes at large this
   difference between the typical sacrifices and the sacrifice of the
   blood of Christ. He tells you those were "offered year by year," and
   could "never make the comers to God by them perfect," or acquit them
   from sin, for then they "should have had no more conscience of sin,"
   being once purged; but now, saith he, "there was a remembrance made
   again of sins every year," verses 1-4. If sin had been taken away,
   there would have been no more conscience of it; that is, no such
   conscience as upon the account whereof they came for help unto or
   healing by those sacrifices, -- no more conscience condemning for sin.
   Conscience judges according to the obligation unto punishment which it
   apprehends upon it. Conscience of sin, -- that is, a tenderness to sin,
   and a condemnation of sin, -- still continues after the taking of the
   guilt of it away; but conscience disquieting, judging, condemning the
   person for sin, that vanisheth together with the guilt of it: [144] and
   this is done when the sacrifice for sin is perfect and complete, and
   really attains the end for which it was instituted. And if any
   sacrifice for sin whatever do not completely take away that sin for
   which the oblation is made, and the atonement thereby, so that no
   after-charge might come upon the sinner, it is of necessity that that
   sacrifice be renewed again and again. The reason the apostle gives of
   the repetition of the legal sacrifices is, that they made not the
   comers to them perfect; that is, as to the taking away of their sins,
   and giving them entire and complete peace thereupon. All this, the
   apostle informs us, was done in the sacrifice of Christ: Verse 14, "By
   one offering he hath for ever perfected" (or made perfect that work for
   them as to this business of conscience for sin) "them that are
   sanctified." His one offering perfectly put an end to this business,
   even the difference between God and us upon the account of sin; which
   if he had not done, it would have been necessary that he should have
   been often offered, his sacrifice having not obtained the complete end
   thereof. That the efficacy of this sacrifice of his cannot depend on
   any thing foreign unto it shall be declared afterward; also, that the
   necessity of our faith and obedience, in their proper place, is not in
   the least, hereby impaired, shall be manifested. That they may have a
   proper place, efficacy, and usefulness, and not be conditions whereon
   the effects of the death of Christ are suspended, as to their
   communication unto us, is by some denied; how weakly, how falsely, will
   then also appear. Now, this Christ doth for all that are sanctified, or
   dedicated, or consecrated unto God (which is almost the perpetual sense
   of that word in this epistle), in and by that offering of his. And this
   the apostle farther confirms from the consideration of the new covenant
   with us, ratified in, and whose effects were procured by, the
   blood-shedding and offering of Christ: Verse 17, "Their sins and their
   iniquities will I remember no more." Saith God, "Upon the account of
   the offering of Christ, there is an end of that business and that
   controversy which I have had with those sanctified ones; and therefore
   let them, as to this, as to the making satisfaction for sin, trouble
   themselves no more, to think of thousands of rams, or the like, for
   there is no more offering for sin required," Micah vi. 6, 7. And on
   this foundation I may say there doth not remain any such guilt to be
   reckoned unto believers as that with regard thereunto God should
   forsake them utterly, and give them over unto everlasting ruin. And
   this is the sum of the apostle's discourse in that chapter, as it looks
   upon the matter under present consideration: That sacrifice which so
   taketh away the sins of them for whom it is offered as that thereupon
   they should be perfect, or perfectly acquitted of them, and have no
   more conscience (which is a judgment of a man's self answering to the
   judgment of God concerning him) of sin, so to judge him and condemn him
   for it as not to have remedy of that judgment or condemnation provided
   in that sacrifice, -- that, I say, doth so take away the guilt of sin
   as that it shall never separate between God and them for whom and whose
   sin it was offered; but such was the sacrifice of Christ: ergo, etc.
   The reason of the consequence is clear from the very form of the
   proposition, and nothing is assumed but what is the express testimony
   of the apostle in that and other places.

   So Dan. ix. 25. The design in the death of Christ is "to finish the
   transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation
   for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness" Christ makes
   an end of sin: not that there should be no more sin in the world, for
   there is yet sinning to the purpose, in some respect much more than
   before his death, [145] and there will be so to eternity, if those
   under the ultimate sentence may be thought to sin; but he makes an end
   of it as to the controversy and difference about it between God and
   them for whom he died, and that by making reconciliation on the part of
   God, atoning him towards us [146] (which atonement we are persuaded to
   accept), and by bringing in for us a righteousness which is everlasting
   and will abide the trial, which God will certainly accept. [147] Now,
   when God is satisfied for sin, and we are furnished with a
   righteousness exactly complete and answering to the utmost of his
   demand, whence can any more contest arise about the guilt of sin, or
   the obligation of the sinner unto punishment that from the justice and
   law of God doth attend it? This also the apostle urgeth, Rom. viii. 34,
   "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died." He argueth from
   the death of Christ to the ablation or removal of condemnation for sin,
   because by his death he hath "made an end of sin," as was showed, "and
   brought in everlasting righteousness;" Heb. x. 14-18. To suspend the
   issue of all these transactions between God and the Mediator upon
   conditions by us to be accomplished, not bestowed on us, not purchased
   for us, and as to their event uncertain, is disadvantageously to beg
   the thing in question.

   Now, because it appears that, notwithstanding the death of Christ, many
   for whom he died are kept a long season under the guilt of sin, [148]
   and are all of them born in a condition of wrath, Eph. ii. 3, I shall
   crave leave a little to insist on this instance, and to show that
   notwithstanding the truth thereof, yet the guilt of sin is so taken
   away from all those for whom Christ died, by his death, that it shall
   never be a cause of everlasting separation between God and them. In the
   obedience and death of Christ, whereby, as a completely sufficient and
   efficacious means, he made way for the accomplishment of his eternal
   purposes, in such paths of infinite wisdom as brought in all the good
   he aimed at by it, in that order which the very frame and nature of
   things by him appointed required for the exaltation of his glory, God
   is satisfied, well pleased, and resolved that he will not take his
   course at law against those in the behalf of whom he died, 2 Cor. v.
   18-20.

   Though an arrest was gone forth against all mankind, yet the Lord
   suspended by his sovereignty the utmost execution of it, that room and
   space might be given, according to the eternal thoughts of his heart,
   for the deliverance of some. A reprieve is granted mankind, out of
   reasons and for purposes of his own. After the sentence of death was
   denounced against them, God being pleased to magnify his grace,
   according to his eternal counsel and purpose in Jesus Christ, innovates
   the law, as to the obligation of it unto punishment, on the behalf of
   some, by the interposition of the Son of his love in such a way as to
   undergo what was due unto those on whose behalf the interposition was
   made. [149] And by this undertaking of Christ, in the very first notion
   of it, as it was satisfactory, thus much is done and accomplished:--

   (1.) The vindictive justice of God is satisfied. That is, whereas such
   is the natural right, sovereignty, and dominion of God over his
   creatures, and such his essential perfections of holiness, purity, and
   righteousness, that if his creatures cast off his yoke and their
   dependence on him (which they do by every sin, what in them lieth), it
   is then of indispensable necessity that he render unto that sin or
   sinner guilty thereof a meet recompense of reward; [150] Jesus Christ
   hath so answered his righteousness, [151] that without the impairing of
   his right or sovereignty, without the least derogation from his
   perfections, he may receive his sinning creatures again to favour. It
   being "the judgment of God that they which commit sin are worthy of
   death," Rom. i. 32, and "a righteous thing with him to render
   tribulation to sinners," 1 Thess. i. 6, for "shall not the Judge of all
   the earth do right?" Gen. xviii. 25; he hath set forth his Son to
   "declare his righteousness for the remission of sins," Rom. iii. 24,
   25. Now, for whom Christ died, he died for all their sins: 1 John i. 7,
   "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin," the application
   of it being commensurate to his intendment in his oblation, not
   extending itself to the actual effecting of any thing whatever which
   was not meritoriously procured thereby. "He loved the church, and gave
   himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
   of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious
   church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it
   should be holy and without blemish," Eph. v. 25-27. He makes complete
   atonement to the justice of God on their behalf, so that the very
   vindictive justice of God hath nothing to lay to their charge. That
   which in God maintains the quarrel against sinners is atoned, and is no
   more their enemy than mercy itself; and this not upon condition of
   believing, to be antecedently accomplished before this be done. The
   satisfaction of justice vindictive depends not at all on any thing in
   us; it requires only that there be vindicta noxæ, and a vindication of
   the sovereignty of God over the sinning creature, by the infliction of
   that punishment which, in his infinite wisdom and righteousness, he
   hath proportioned unto sin. On a supposition of sin, in such creatures
   as being made meet and fit to yield voluntary obedience unto God, and
   so standing in a moral subjection to him, being their cutting off, what
   lies in them, their dependence on God (which that it should be
   continued is as necessary as that God be God, or the Lord of all),
   those creatures are, upon the account of the sovereignty and
   righteousness of God, whereof we speak, indispensably obnoxious unto
   punishment, which is of necessity required unto God's retaining his
   dominion over them. By the death of Christ, this condition is so far
   repaired that the dependence and subjection unto God of those for whom
   he died is made up so far as to a deliverance of them from a necessity
   of being obnoxious unto punishment, and that completely, without any
   abeyance upon conditions in themselves, which can have no influence
   thereinto. So that, though the process of the law sent forth be not
   instantly recalled, but man is suffered to lie under that arrest for a
   season, yet God lets fall his suit on this account, and will never pass
   his first sentence, from which we are reprieved, unto full and final
   execution, pronouncing himself well pleased with his Son, [152] resting
   satisfied with his mediatory performances, and seeking no farther.

   (2.) The law of God is fulfilled. Unless this be answered in all the
   concernments of it, the Lord would be thought to change his will, to
   reverse his word, and to blur the copy of his own holiness. There is in
   the whole law and every parcel of it an eternal, indispensable
   righteousness and truth, arising either from the nature of the things
   themselves concerning which it is, or the relation of one thing unto
   another. That to fear God, to love him, to obey him, to do no wrong,
   are everlastingly, indispensably good and necessary, is from the nature
   of the things themselves, only with this supposition, that God would
   make creatures capable of yielding him such obedience. That that which
   is good shall be so rewarded, that which is evil so punished, is also
   an everlasting truth, upon supposition of such actual performances.
   Whereas, then, of this law there are two parts, the one absolute or
   preceptive in the rule and commands thereof, the other condition, al,
   and rewarding in its promise or condemning in its curse, Christ by his
   death put himself, in their behalf for whom he died (to speak to that
   particular), under the curse of it: "He redeemed us from the curse of
   the law, being made a curse for us," Gal. iii. 13. [153] Neither is
   this at all suspended on our believing. The law doth not threaten a
   curse only if we do not believe, but if we do not all things written
   therein, Deut. xxvii. 26. Whether we believe or not, the law takes no
   notice; as to the curse that it denounceth, if there hath been any sin,
   that must be executed. And the law is for the curse, as Isaac for the
   great spiritual blessing, Gen. xxvii. 27-29. He had but one; it hath
   but one great curse, and that being undergone by Christ, it hath not
   another for them in whose stead Christ underwent it. God having "made
   him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, we become the righteousness of
   God in him," 2 Cor. v. 21. All separation from God is by the curse of
   the law; all that is required in it, by it, is, that it be undergone.
   This is done by Christ for all believers; that thereby is taken away
   which alone can separate them from God or put any distance between
   them. But of this, and their subjection to the curse before their
   believing, more afterward.

   (3.) The truth or veracity of God was particularly engaged to see sin
   punished, upon the account of the promulgation of the first express
   sanction of the law: "In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt
   surely die," Gen. ii. 17. For the satisfying the engagement of God's
   truth, there seemed to be a tender made in the sacrifices instituted of
   old; but it was rejected as insufficient to make good that word of God
   so eminently given out. There was neither any such relation, union, or
   conjunction, between the sinner and the innocent creature sacrificed,
   nor any such real worth in the sacrifice itself, as that the death of
   the substituted beast might by any means be so interpreted as to amount
   to the accomplishment of the truth of God, death being once denounced
   as the reward of sin: Heb. x. 5, 6, "Sacrifice and offering thou
   wouldest not: in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no
   pleasure;" but saith our Saviour, "Lo, I come to do try will, O God,"
   verse 7. Will that do it? Yea, it will assuredly, for in the volume of
   his book it is written that he should so do. All that God willed to be
   done for the accomplishment of his truth was fulfilled by Christ when
   he came to give up himself, a sweet-smelling sacrifice, Eph. v. 2. God,
   then, may be true, his truth being salved to the utmost, though never
   any one of them for whom Christ died do die. But this, to the salvation
   of believers, is only as removens prohibens.

   (4.) The distributive justice of God is upon this oblation of Christ
   engaged, upon the covenant and compact made with Christ as mediator to
   that purpose, to bestow on them for whom he offered and died all the
   good things which he promised him for them, in and upon the account of
   his undertaking in their behalf. [154] The distributive justice of God
   is that perfection of his nature whereby he rendereth to every one
   according to what either his vindictive justice on the one side, or his
   uprightness and faithfulness on the other, do require. [155] In
   rewarding, it respects his own faithfulness in all his engagements
   immediately; in punishing, the demerit of the creature; -- there being
   no such natural connection and necessary coherence, from the nature of
   the things themselves, between obedience and reward as there is between
   sin and punishment.

   Now, the Lord having given many eminent and glorious promises to his
   Son Jesus Christ (some whereof we shall mention afterward) concerning
   his seed and offspring, or those that he committed to his charge to be
   redeemed from their sins, [156] it is incumbent on him, in regard of
   his righteousness, to make out all those things in due time unto them;
   and therefore, that he might magnify that righteousness and truth of
   his, he hath cast the whole procedure of his grace into such a way, and
   all the acts of it into such a dependence upon one another, as that the
   one of them should have infallible influence into the other, and the
   effects of every one of them be rendered indubitably certain.

   Thus upon the account of the death of Christ, antecedently to all
   considerations of faith or belief in them for whom he died, thus much
   is done for the extinguishing the quarrel about sin: The vindictive
   justice, law, and truth of God, are disengaged from pursuing the
   sentence of death and everlasting separation from God against them as
   sinners, neither have they at all any thing to lay to their charge for
   which they should be cast out of the presence of God; yea, the Lord is
   moreover, in his own faithfulness and righteousness, with respect to
   the covenant of the Mediator, engaged to do that which is needful to
   the brining of them to himself. [157] After some previous observations,
   I shall confirm what hath been spoken by sundry arguments. I say, then,
   --

   (1.) That it is a most vain supposal which some make: "What if any one
   of them for whom Christ died should die in an unregenerate condition?
   would not the justice and condemning power of the law of God,
   notwithstanding the death of Christ, lay hold upon them?" It is, I say,
   a supposal of that which in sensu composito is impossible, and so in
   that sense (however upon other respects it may) not to be argued from.
   Christ died that those for whom he died might live, that they might be
   quickened and born again; [158] and so they shall, in their due season,
   every one undoubtedly be, and not any of them die in their sins.

   (2.) That our affirmation is not in the least liable to that exception
   which usually men insist upon in opposition unto it, -- namely, "That
   if Christ hath so satisfied justice, and fulfilled the law in reference
   to all them for whom he died, that the sentence of condemnation should
   not be issued out against them, but they must infallibly be saved, then
   there is no necessity either that they do at all believe, or, if they
   do, that they live in holiness and the avoidance of sin, all that being
   accomplished which by these mediums is sought for." I say, our position
   in itself is no way liable to this exception; for, --

   [1.] Though the justice, law, and truth of God be satisfied and
   fulfilled as to their sins, so that he hath not on that account any
   thing to lay to their charge, yet this hinders not at all but that God
   may assign and ascribe such a way for their coming to him as may be
   suited to the exalting of his glory, the honour of Jesus Christ, who
   hath brought all this about, and the preparing of the soul of the
   sinner for the full enjoyment of himself: and this he hath done by the
   law of faith; which gives him the glory of his grace and all his other
   attributes; exalts Jesus Christ, whom it is his will we should honour
   as we honour himself; [159] and empties the poor sinful creature of
   itself, that it may be made meet for the inheritance of the saints in
   light. [160]

   [2.] This consideration of the death of Christ, of his freeing us from
   condemnation for any or all of our sins, is not to be taken apart or
   separated from the other, of his procuring the Holy Spirit and grace
   for us, that we should not commit sin, being born of God, with all the
   dispensations of precepts and promises, exhortations and threatenings,
   whereby he morally carries on the work of his grace in the hearts of
   his saints. Setting us free from the guilt of sin, he so far also sets
   us free from the power of sin that we should be dead to it, live no
   longer in it, that it should not reign in us, nor prevail to turn us
   utterly from God. [161]

   [3.] They seem not much to be acquainted with the nature of faith,
   holiness, and communion with God, who suppose the end of them is only
   for the escaping of the wrath that is to come. They are the things
   whereby we are daily renewed and changed into the image of the glory of
   God, [162] and so not only made useful and serviceable to him here, but
   also prepared for the fullness of his likeness, wherewith we shall be
   satisfied, hereafter. Wherefore, observe, --

   [4.] That though this complete atonement be made in the death of
   Christ, yet it remains free in the bosom of God when he will begin our
   actual deliverance from under that arrest of death that was gone out
   against us, [163] and how far in this life he will carry it towards
   perfection. [164] It is, I say, in his bosom when he will bestow his
   Spirit on us for regeneration and faith, when he will actually absolve
   us from under the arrest of the law, by the application of his mercies
   in Christ unto us by the promise of the gospel, and how far he will
   carry on the work of our deliverance from sin in this life. Only that
   is done upon the account whereof it is impossible that the quarrel
   against sin should be carried on to the utmost execution of the
   sentence denounced towards those sinners for whom Christ died; [165]
   which I prove by these following arguments:--

   1st. It is plainly affirmed that Christ, by his death, obtained
   "everlasting redemption," Heb. ix. 12. He obtained everlasting
   redemption before his ascending into the most holy place, called
   elsewhere the "purging of our sins," Heb. i. 3. Now this redemption, as
   was said, the apostle informs us consists in "the forgiveness of sins:"
   Eph. i. 7, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the
   forgiveness of sins," or the intercision of that obligation unto
   punishment which attends sin in reference to the sinner, and his
   subjection to the law of God and the righteousness thereof. As the
   oblation of Christ respecteth God and his justice, to whom it is given
   as a price and ransom, and whereof it is an atonement, it is, and is
   called (or we are said to receive thereby), "redemption;" as it
   respects them who receive the benefit of that redemption, it is "the
   forgiveness of sins." Forgiveness of sins, as it is completed and
   terminated in the consciences of believers, requireth the interposition
   of faith, [166] for the receiving of Christ in the promise, "who of God
   is made unto us righteousness," 1 Cor. i. 30; but in respect of the
   procurement of it, and the removing all causes upon the account whereof
   sin should be imputed unto us, that is perfected in the oblation of
   Christ. [167] Hence he is said to "bear our sins in his own body on the
   tree," 1 Pet. ii. 24. And being once on him, either he was discharged
   of them, or he must for ever lie under the burden of them. They were on
   him on the tree; what, then, is become of them? If he were freed of
   them, and justified from them (as he was, Isa. i. 8, 9), how should
   they ever be laid to our charge? And yet this freedom from condemnation
   for sin for all the elect, which God himself so clearly asserts, Rom.
   viii. 32, 33, etc, doth not in the least set them free from the
   necessity of obedience, nor acquit them from contracting the guilt of
   sin upon the least irregularity or disobedience.

   2dly. We are said to do together with Christ those things which he doth
   for us in his own person, and that upon the account of that benefit
   which by those his personal performances doth redound unto us, and
   which being done, the quarrel about sin, as to make an utter separation
   between God and our souls, is certainly removed. Thus we are said to
   die with him, to be raised again with him, and with him we enter into
   the holy place, this whole business about sin being passed through, for
   he that is dead is justified from sin. [168] Now, all this being done
   by us and for us, in and by our Head, can we henceforth die any more?
   shall death any more have dominion over us? This the apostle argues, 2
   Cor. v. 14, 15: "We judge," saith he, "that if one died for all, then
   were all" (that is, all those for whom he died) "dead," or died
   likewise; they were dead in and with him, their sponsor, as to the
   curse due for sin, that henceforth they might "live to him which died
   for them."

   3dly. The compact or agreement that was between the Father and the Son
   as mediator, about the business of our redemption in his blood,
   manifests this truth. The Father required at his hands that he should
   do his will, fulfil his pleasure and counsel, make his soul an offering
   for sin, and do that which the sacrifices of bulls and goats shadowed
   out, but could never effect; upon the performance whereof he was to
   "see his seed," and to "bring many sons to glory." [169] A covenanting
   and agreement into an uncertain issue and event (as that must be of God
   and the Mediator, if the salvation of the persons concerning which and
   whom it was be not infallibly certain) ought not, at any cheap rate or
   pretence, to be assigned to infinite wisdom. In the accomplishment of
   this undertaking, whereunto Christ was designed, the Father dealt with
   him in strict and rigid justice; [170] there was neither composition
   about the debt, nor commutation about the punishment that he had taken
   upon himself. Now, doth not exact justice require that the ransom being
   given in, the prisoners be delivered? that the debt being paid, the
   bond be cancelled as to any power of imprisoning the original debtor?
   that punishment being undergone and the law fulfilled, the offender go
   free? Especially, all this being covenanted for in the first
   undertaking, doubtless wrath shall not arise a second time. The right
   knowledge, use, and improvement, of this grace being given, bounded,
   and directed, by the gospel, it is safeguarded from abuse by that which
   God calls his own wisdom.

   4thly. It appears from what God bestows upon his elect, upon the
   account of the undertaking of Christ for them, in the pursuit of the
   eternal purpose of his will, antecedently to any thing whatsoever in
   them that should engage him to do them the least good. When God comes
   as a friend, to hold out unto and bestow good things upon men, -- I
   mean, good in that kind of mercy which is peculiarly suited to the
   bringing of them to the enjoyment of himself, -- it is evident that he
   hath put an end to all enmity and quarrel between him and them. Now,
   antecedently unto any thing in men, God, for Christ's sake, bestows,
   with the greatest act of friendship imaginable, no less than the Holy
   Spirit on them. By him they are quickened; and their faith is but a
   fruit of that Spirit bestowed on them. If they have not any sufficiency
   in themselves, as much as to think a good thought, nor can do any thing
   that is acceptable to God, being by nature dead in trespasses and sins,
   which at present (the Scripture affirming it) I take for granted, then
   assuredly God doth give his Holy Spirit to the saints, [171] whereby he
   "works in them both to will and to do of his good pleasure," [172]
   antecedently to any good thing in them that is well-pleasing unto him.
   Every thing that men do must either be brought forth by the strength
   and ability of their own natural faculties, assisted and provoked by
   motives and persuasions from without, or it must be the operation of
   the Spirit of God. There is not another principle to be fixed on. The
   first (at present I take it for granted) is not the fountain of any
   spiritual acting whatsoever, neither can any gracious act be educed
   radically from the corrupt natural faculty, however assisted or
   advantaged. [173] It must be the Spirit, then, that is the sole
   principal cause and author of all the movings of our souls towards God
   that are acceptable to him in Christ. Now, the cause is certainly
   before the effect; and the Spirit, in order of nature, is bestowed upon
   us antecedently to all the grace which he worketh in us. Whether the
   Spirit be bestowed on men on the account of Christ's undertaking for
   them none can question but they must withal deny him to be the mediator
   of the new covenant. The Spirit of grace is the principal promise
   thereof, Isa. lix. 20, 21. "We are blessed with all spiritual blessings
   in Christ," Eph. i. 3. Surely the Holy Spirit himself, so often
   promised to us of God, is a spiritual blessing. God's bestowing faith
   on us is antecedent to our believing, and this also is given upon the
   account of Christ: Phil. i. 29, "Unto you it is given in the behalf of
   Christ to believe on him." If, then, God, for Christ's sake,
   antecedently to any thing that is good, that is not enmity to him, that
   is not iniquity in men, do bestow on them all that ever is good in
   them, as to the root and principle of it, surely his quarrel against
   their sins is put to an issue. Hence Christ being said to "make
   reconciliation for the sins of the people," Heb. ii. 17, God, as one
   pacified and atoned thereupon, is said to be "in him reconciling the
   world unto himself," 2 Cor. v. 19; and in the dispensation of the
   gospel he is still set forth as one carrying on that peace whose
   foundation is laid in the blood of his Son, [174] by the atonement of
   his justice; and we are said to accept or "receive the atonement," Rom.
   v. 11. We receive it by faith, it being accepted by him. Thus this
   death and oblation is said to be a "sacrifice of a sweet-smelling
   savour," Eph. v. 2, -- that wherein God is abundantly delighted, and
   wherewith his soul is fully satisfied; so that as when he smelled a
   sweet savour from the sacrifice of Noah, he sware he would curse the
   earth no more, [175] smelling this sweet savour of the oblation of
   Christ on the account of them for whom it was offered, he will not
   execute the curse on them whereof they were guilty. I might also insist
   on those testimonies, for the farther proof of the former assertion,
   where an immediate efficacy for the taking away of sin is ascribed to
   the death of Christ; [176] but what hath been spoken may at present
   suffice.

   The premises considered, some light may be brought forth to discover
   the various mistakes of men about the effects of the death of Christ as
   to the taking away of sin, if that were now the matter before us. [177]
   Some having truly fixed their thoughts on the efficacy of the death of
   Christ for abolition of sin, do give their lusts and darkness leave to
   make wretched inferences thereupon; as that, "Because we are so
   completely justified and accepted before and without our believing, or
   the consideration of any thing whatever in us, therefore sin is
   nothing, nor at all to be accounted of." And though they say we must
   not sin that grace may abound, yet too many, by woful experience, have
   discovered what such corrupt conclusions have tended unto. Others,
   again, fixing themselves on the necessity of obedience, and the
   concurrence of actual faith to the completing of justification in the
   soul of the sinner, with a no less dangerous reflection upon the truth,
   do suspend the efficacy of the death of Christ upon our believing,
   "which gives life, and vigour, and virtue unto it," as they say, "and
   is the sole originally discriminating cause of all the benefits we
   receive thereby. Without the antecedent accomplishment of that
   condition in us, or our actual believing, it is not," say they, "nor
   will be, useful." Yea, that "the intention of God is to bestow upon us
   the fruits and effects of the death of Christ, upon condition we do
   believe; which that we shall is no part of his purchase, and which we
   can of ourselves perform," say some of them, others not. Doubtless,
   these things are not, being rightly stated, in the least inconsistent.
   Christ may have his due, and we [may be] bound to the performance of
   our duty; which might be cleared by an enlargement of the ensuing
   considerations:--

   (1.) That all good things whatsoever that are spiritual, that are
   wrought either for men or in them, are fruits of the death of Christ.
   They have nothing of themselves but nakedness, blood, and sin, guilt
   and impenitency; so that it is of indispensable necessity that God
   should show them favour antecedently to any act of their believing on
   him. Faith is given for Christ's sake, as was observed.

   (2.) That all the effects and fruits of the death of Christ, antecedent
   to our believing, are deposited in the hand of the righteousness and
   faithfulness of God, to whom as a ransom it was paid, as an atonement
   it was offered, before whom as a price and purchase it was laid down.
   [178] It is all left in the hands of God's faithfulness, righteousness,
   mercy, and grace, to be made out effectually to them for whom he died,
   in the appointed time or season. So that, --

   (3.) The state or condition of those for whom Christ died is not
   actually and really changed by his death in itself, but they lie under
   the curse whilst they are in the state of nature, unregenerate, and all
   effects of sin whatever. [179] That which is procured for them is left
   in the hand of the Father; they are not in the least intrusted with it
   until the appointed time do come.

   (4.) That faith and belief are necessary, not to add any thing to
   complete the procurement of forgiveness of sins, any or all, but only
   to the actual receiving of it, when, upon the account of the death of
   Christ, it pleaseth God, in the promise of the gospel, to hold it out
   and impart it unto the soul, thereby completing covenant-justification.

   And thus the whole business of salvation may be resolved into the
   mediation of Christ, and yet men carried on under an orderly
   dispensation of law and gospel into the enjoyment of it. Of the whole,
   these degrees are considerable:--

   (1.) God's eternal purpose of saving some in and by the mediation of
   Christ, that mediation of Christ being interposed between the purpose
   of God and the accomplishment of the thing purposed, as the fruit and
   effect of the one, the meritorious procuring cause of the other. This
   act of the will of God the Scripture knows by no other name than that
   of "election," or "predestination," or "the purpose of God according to
   election," or "the purpose of his will in Jesus Christ;" which though
   it comprise his will of not punishing them in their own persons that
   are within the verge of this his purpose, yet it is not properly an act
   of forgiveness of sin, nor are they pardoned by it, nor is the law
   actually innovated or its obligation on them unto punishment dissolved,
   nor themselves justified in any sense thereby. [180]

   (2.) That interposition of the Lord Christ whereof we have been
   treating being a medium indispensably necessary as to satisfaction, and
   freely designed by the will and wisdom of God for such a procurement of
   the good things designed in his eternal counsel as might advance the
   glory of his grace and make known his righteousness also; and this
   being fixed on by God as the only thing by him required that all the
   mercies, all the grace of his eternal purpose, might be dispensed in
   the order by him designed unto them; upon the performance of it God
   resteth as well pleased, and they for whom he hath mediated by his
   blood, or for whom he is considered so to have done, are reconciled
   unto God, as to' that part of reconciliation which respects the love of
   God, as to the dispensing the fruits of it unto them even whilst they
   are enemies, upon the accounts before mentioned. [181]

   (3.) Things being thus stated between God and them for whom Christ
   died, on the account of his death God actually absolves them from under
   that sentence and curse of the law, by sending the Spirit of his Son
   into their hearts, to quicken them and to implant faith in them. [182]
   And in what act of God to place his actual absolution of sinners,
   ungodly persons, whom Christ died for, but in this actual collation of
   the Spirit and habit of grace on them, I am not as yet satisfied.
   Neither doth this in any measure confound our justification and
   sanctification; for nothing hinders but that the same act, as it is of
   free grace in opposition to works or any thing in us, may justify us,
   or exert the fruit of his love, which was before purchased by Christ,
   in our gracious acceptation, notwithstanding all that was against us,
   and also, by principling us with grace for obedience, sanctify us
   throughout.

   (4.) This being done, they with whom God thus graciously deals "receive
   the atonement," and, "being justified by faith, have peace with God."
   But this is not the matter or subject of our present contest.

   This, then, is the first influence which the blood-shedding in the
   death and oblation of Christ hath into the saints' continuance of the
   love and favour of God: It taketh away the guilt of sin, that it shall
   not be such a provocation to the eyes of his glory (his law being
   fulfilled and justice satisfied) as to cause him utterly to turn away
   his love from them; and they becoming "the righteousness of God in
   him," [183] to all intents and purposes, what should separate them from
   the love of God? He hath made peace in the blood of the cross of his
   Son, and will not engage in enmity against his elect any more to
   eternity; but, in his own way and own time (as he hath the sovereignty
   of all in his hands), he will bring them infallibly to the enjoyment of
   himself. [184] And thus much, by this discourse about the effects of
   the death of Christ, have we clearly obtained: What Christ aims to
   accomplish by his death, and what was the design and intention of the
   Father that he should accomplish, that cannot fail of its issue and
   appointed event by any interposure whatever. That the effectual removal
   of every thing that might intercept, hinder, or turn aside, the love
   and favour of God from them for whom he died, is the designed effect of
   the death of Christ, hath been demonstrated. This, then, in the order
   wherein it hath seemed good to the infinite wisdom of God to proceed in
   dispensing his grace unto sinners, shall certainly be fulfilled, and
   all believers saved to the utmost.

   2. I come, in the second place, to demonstrate that our Saviour secures
   the stability of the love of the saints to God and their abiding with
   him, by taking away and removing whatever might hinder them herein, or
   prevail upon them utterly and wickedly to depart from him. That which
   meritoriously might cause God to turn from us he utterly destroys and
   abolishes; and that which efficiently might cause us to turn from God,
   that also he destroys and removes. Now, all that is of this kind, that
   works effectually and powerfully for the alienating of the hearts of
   believers from God, or keeping men in a state of alienation from him,
   may be referred unto two principles: (1.) Satan himself; [185] (2.) His
   works. The world, as under the curse, is an instrument in his hand, who
   is called the god thereof, to allure, vex, and mischief us withal;
   neither hath it the least power or efficacy in itself, but only as it
   is managed in the hand of Satan to turn men from God. [186] And yet the
   Lord Christ hath not let that go free neither without its death's
   wound, but bids his followers "be of good cheer, for he had overcome
   the world," -- that is, for them, and in their stead, -- so that it
   should never be used nor heightened in its enmity to a conquest over
   them; [187] I mean a total and final conquest, such as might frustrate
   any intention of God in his undertaking for them. It is not our loss of
   a little blood, but our loss of life, that makes the enemy a conqueror.
   But now for Satan:--

   (1.) He overcomes, destroys, and breaks him in pieces, with his power:
   Heb. ii. 14, "Through death he destroyed him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil." The first thing that was promised of him
   was, that he should "break the head of the serpent," Gen. iii. 15, He
   doth it also in and for "the seed of the woman," -- all the elect of
   God, opposed to the seed of the serpent or generation of vipers. In
   pursuit hereof he "spoils principalities and powers, and makes a show
   of them openly, triumphing over them in his cross," Col. ii. 15. In the
   blood of his cross he conquered, and brake the power of the devil,
   "binding that strong man armed, and spoiling his goods," making a show
   of him and them, as great conquerors were wont to do with their
   captives and their spoils.

   Now, there are two ways whereby the blood of Christ thus brake the
   power of Satan, that he shall not lead those always captive at his
   pleasure, nor rule in them, as children of disobedience, in the behalf
   of whom his power was so broken:--

   [1.] He subdues him by taking away all that right and title which he
   had by sin to rule over them: I speak of the elect of God. By the
   entrance of sin, the devil entered upon a twofold rule in reference to
   sinners:-- 1st. A rule over them with the terror and dread of death and
   hell They are in bondage by reason of death all their days, Heb. ii.
   14, 15; and the devil hath the power of that death upon the world
   whereunto they are in bondage. The death that is in the curse is put
   into his hand to manage it, to the dread and terror of sinners; and by
   it he bath always kept many, and to this day doth keep innumerable
   souls in unexpressible bondage, putting them upon barbarous
   inhumanities to make atonement for their sins, and forcing some to
   inflict revenge and destruction upon themselves, thinking to prevent,
   but really hastening, that which they fear. As of old this power of his
   lay at the bottom of all the abominations wherewith men provoked God
   when they thought to atone him, [188] as by burning their children in
   the fire, and the like, Micah vi. 6, 7, [189] so at present is it the
   principle of all that superstitious will-worship and religious drudgery
   which is spread over the antichristian world. Yea, the inventions of
   men ignorant of the righteousness of God, and convinced of their own
   insufficiency to perform, work out, and establish, a righteousness of
   their own, that shall perfectly answer the exact, holy demands of the
   law, as far as to them is discovered, to deliver themselves from under
   this dread of death, wherewith he that hath the power of it terrifies
   them all their days, are indeed the foundation and spring, the sum and
   substance, of all religions in the world, and the darling of all
   religious persons, in and with whom Christ is not all and in all. And
   herein have the Papists gone one notable step beyond all their
   predecessors in superstition and devotion; for whereas they universally
   contented themselves with sacrifices, purifications, purgations,
   lustrations, satisfactions, recompenses, to be in this life performed,
   these latter, -- more refined, sublimated, mercurial wits, -- observing
   that nothing they could here invent would settle and charm the spirits
   of men haunted with the dread of death we speak of, but that instantly
   they came again, with the same disquietness as formerly, and renewed
   mention of sin, upon the insufficiency of the atonement fixed on for
   its expiation, they found out that noble expedient of the future
   purgatory, which might maintain the souls of men in some hopes in this
   life, and secure themselves from the cries and complaints of men
   against the insufficiency of their remedy which they do prescribe.
   2dly. As he rules over men by death, and hell that follows after, so
   also he rules in men by sin: he "ruleth in the children of
   disobedience," Eph. ii. 2. And to this end, to secure men to himself,
   -- he being that strong man armed who hath the first possession, and
   labours to keep what he hath got in peace, [190] -- he sets up
   strongholds, imaginations, and high things, against God, 2 Cor. iv. 4.
   Now, this twofold power of Satan, over men and in mere, doth both arise
   from sin, whereby men are first cast out of God's love and care,
   becoming obnoxious to death, and, secondly, are alienated from God in
   willing subjection to his enemy. And both these parts and branches of
   his dominion are, in reference unto the elect, east down and destroyed,
   and taken away; for, first, Christ by his death cashiers the title and
   claim that Satan laid to the exercise of any such power, in reference
   unto the elect. When men cast down any from rule, they may interrupt
   and put by their exercise of any power, but they cannot take away their
   title unless it be of their own giving. Christ by his death takes away
   the very bottom, foundation, and occasion, of the whole power of Satan.
   All the power of Satan in the first sense consists in death, and those
   things that either conduce to it or do attend it. Blow, death entered
   by sin, and therewithal the power of Satan. [191] The Lord Jesus taking
   away sin and putting an end thereunto, as was manifested, the whole
   title of Satan falls and comes to nothing, Heb. ii. 9-15. And this was
   really done in the cross, its manifestation by the gospel ensuing
   thereupon, according to the appointment of God, Col. ii. 15; Titus i.
   3.

   [2.] He takes away the exercise of his power, and that to the utmost:
   for he binds him with bonds, -- he binds the strong man armed, Matt.
   xii. 29; and he breaks his head, Gen. iii. 15; then leads him captive,
   Ps. lxviii. 18; triumphs over him, Col. ii. 15; treads him down under
   the feet of his, Rom. xvi. 20, as the kings of Canaan were trod down
   under the feet of the children of Israel; then destroys him, Heb. ii.
   14. What exercise of power is left to a conquered, bound, wounded,
   captived, triumphed-over, trodden-down, destroyed caitiff?

   Think ye this wretch shall ever wholly prevail against any one of them
   for whose sake all this was done to him? Neither can this with any
   colour of reason be said to be done for them, or with respect unto
   them, towards whom the power of Satan remains entire all their days,
   whom he leads captive and rules over at his pleasure, until death takes
   full dominion over them.

   (2.) As he destroys Satan, so he doth his works: "For this cause was he
   manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil," 1 John iii.
   8. He doth not only bind the strong man armed, but also he spoils his
   goods, Matt. xii. 29. Whatsoever is in men that follows from that
   corrupted principle of nature is reckoned to the work of Satan, being
   the issue of his seduction. Whatsoever his temptations draw men out
   unto, the Lord Christ came to destroy it all, to make an end of it; and
   he will not fail of his end, but certainly carry on his undertaking,
   until he hath utterly destroyed all those works of Satan in the hearts
   of all that are his. He "redeems us from our vain conversation," 2 Pet.
   i. 18, 19, -- from the power of our lusts and corruptions, leading us
   out to a vain conversation. The apostle tells us, Rom. vi. 6, that by
   his death the "old man is crucified," and the "body of sin destroyed."
   The craft of sin, the old man, and the strength of sin, the body of it,
   -- or the ruling of original sin, the old man, and the full fruit of
   actual sin in the body of it, -- are by the death of Christ crucified
   and destroyed. And in that whole chapter, from our participation in the
   death of Christ, he argues to such an abolition of the law and rule of
   sin, to such a breaking of the power and strength of it, that it is
   impossible that it should any more rule in us or have dominion over us.
   Of the way whereby virtue flows out from the death of Christ for the
   killing of sin I am not now to speak.

   And this is the first way whereby the death of Christ hath an influence
   into the safeguarding of believers in their continuance in the love and
   favour of God: He so takes away the guilt of sin that it shall never be
   able utterly to turn the love of God from them; and so takes away the
   rule of Satan and power of sin, destroying the one and killing the
   other, that they shall never be able to turn them wholly from God.

   II. Farther to secure their continuance with God, he procureth the Holy
   Spirit for them, as was showed before. But because, much weight lies
   upon this part of our foundation, I shall a little farther clear it up.
   That the Spirit of grace and adoption, with all those spiritual mercies
   and operations wherewith he is attended and accompanied, is a promise
   of the new covenant, doubtless is by its own evidence put out of
   question. There is scarce any promise thereof wherein he is not either
   clearly expressed or evidently included; yea, and oftentimes the whole
   covenant is stated in that one promise of the Spirit, the actual
   collation and bestowing of all the mercy thereof being his proper work
   and peculiar dispensation for the carrying on the great design of the
   salvation of sinners. So Isa. lix. 21, "As for me," saith God, "this is
   my covenant with them; My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which
   I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth," etc.; --
   "This is my covenant," saith God, "or what in my covenant I do
   faithfully engage to bestow upon you." But of this text and its
   vindication more afterward. Many other places, not only pregnant of
   proof to the same purpose, but expressly in terms affirming it, might
   be insisted on.

   Now, that this Spirit, promised in the covenant of grace, as to the
   bestowing of him on the elect of God, or those for whom Christ died, is
   of his purchasing and procurement in his death, is apparent:--

   1. Because he is the mediator of the covenant, by whose hands and for
   whose sake all the mercies of it are made out to them who are admitted
   into the bond thereof. Though men are not completely stated in the
   covenant before their own believing, which brings in what on their part
   is stipulated, yet the covenant and grace of it lays hold of them
   before, even to bestow faith on them, or they would never believe; for
   faith is not of ourselves, it is the gift of God. [192] God certainly
   bestows no such gifts but from a covenant. Spiritual graces are not
   administered solely in a providential dispensation. Faith for the
   receiving the pardon of sin is no gift nor product of the covenant of
   works. Now, as in general the mercies of the covenant are procured by
   the mediator of it, so this whereof we speak in an especial manner:
   Heb. ix. 15, "For this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
   that by means of death, they which are called might receive the promise
   of eternal inheritance." By his death, they for whom he died, and who
   thereupon are called, being delivered from their sins, which were
   against the covenant of works, [193] receive the promise or pledge of
   an eternal inheritance. What this great promise here intended is, and
   wherein it doth consist, the Holy Ghost declares, Acts ii. 33. The
   promise which Jesus Christ received of the Father, upon his exaltation,
   was that of the Holy Ghost, having purchased and procured the bestowing
   of him by his death. Upon his exaltation, the dispensation thereof is
   committed to him, as being part of the compact and covenant which was
   between his Father and himself, the grand bottom of his satisfaction
   and merit. This is the great, original, radical promise of that eternal
   inheritance. By the promised Spirit are we begotten anew unto a hope
   thereof, made meet for it, and sealed up unto it: [194] yea, do but
   look upon the Spirit as promised, and ye may conclude him purchased;
   "for all the promises of God are yea and amen in Jesus Christ," 2 Cor.
   i. 20. They all have their confirmation, establishment, and
   accomplishment in, by, and for Jesus Christ. And if it be granted that
   any designed, appointed mercy whatever, that, in Christ, the Lord
   blesseth us withal, be procured for us by him in the way of merit
   (being given freely to us through him, but reckoned to him of debt), it
   will easily be manifested that the same is the condition of every mercy
   whatever promised unto us, and given us upon his mediatory
   interposition.

   2. It appears from that peculiar promise that Christ makes of sending
   his Holy Spirit unto his own. He tells them, indeed, once and again,
   that the Father will send him, as he comes from that original and
   fountain love from which also himself was sent; [195] but withal he
   assures us that he himself will send him: John xv. 26, "When the
   Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the
   Spirit of truth." It is true that he is promised here only as a
   comforter, for the performance of that part of his office; but look,
   upon what account he is sent for any one act or work of grace, on that
   he is sent for all. John xvi. 7, "I will send him then," saith Christ;
   and that as a fruit of his death, as the procurement of his mediation,
   for that alone he promiseth to bestow [Him] on his. And, in particular,
   he tells us that he receives the Spirit from the Father for us, upon
   his intercession; wherein, as hath been elsewhere demonstrated, [196]
   he asks no more nor leas than what by his death is obtained: John xiv.
   16, 17, "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
   Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of
   truth; whom the world cannot receive." He tells us, verse 13, that
   whatsoever we ask he will do it; but withal in these verses how he will
   do it, even by interceding with the Father for it as a fruit of his
   blood-shedding, and the promise made to him upon his undertaking to
   glorify his Father's name in the great work of redemption, John xvii.
   4-6. And therefore he informs us, that when the Comforter, whom he
   procureth for us, shall come, "he shall glorify him," and "shall
   receive of his, and show it unto us," John xvi. 14, -- farther manifest
   his glory, in his bringing nothing with him but what is his, or of his
   procurement: so also instructing us dearly and plentifully to ask in
   his name, that is, for his sake, -- which to do plainly and openly is
   the great privilege of the, new testament; -- for so he tells his
   disciples, chap. xvi. 24, "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name,"
   who yet were believers, and bad made many addresses unto God in and
   through him, but darkly, as they did under the old testament, when they
   begged mercy "for his sake," Dan. ix. 17; but to plead with the Father
   clearly upon the account of the mediation and purchase of Christ, that,
   I say, is the privilege of the new testament. Now, in this way he would
   have us ask the Holy Spirit at the hand of God, Luke xi. 9-13. Ask him;
   that is, as to a clearer, fuller administration of him unto us, for he
   is antecedently bestowed, as to the working of faith and regeneration,
   even unto this application: for without him we cannot once ask in the
   name of Christ, for none can call Jesus Lord, or do any thing in his
   name, but by the Spirit of God. This I say, then: He in whom we are
   "blessed with all spiritual blessings" hath procured the Holy Spirit
   for us, and through his intercession he is bestowed on us, Eph. i. 3.
   Now, "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" from sin,
   peace and acceptance with God, 2 Cor. iii. 17. But it may be objected,
   "Although this Spirit be thus bestowed on believers, yet may they not
   cast him off, so that his abode with them may be but for a season, and
   their glory not be safeguarded in the issue, but their condemnation
   increased by their receiving of him, Rom. viii. 14, 15?" This being the
   only thing wherein this proof of believers' abiding with God seems
   liable to exception, I shall give a triple testimony of the certainty
   of the continuance of the Holy Spirit with them on whom he is bestowed,
   that in the mouth of two or three witnesses this truth may be
   established; and they are no mean ones neither, but the three that bear
   witness in heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

   The first you have Isa. lix. 21, "As for me, this is my covenant with
   them, saith the Lord; My Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which
   I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of
   the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
   the Lord, from henceforth and for ever." That which the Lord declares
   here to the church he calls "his covenant." Now, whereas in a covenant
   there are two things, -- 1. What is stipulated on the part of him that
   makes the covenant; 2. What of them is required with whom it is made
   (which in themselves are distinct, though in the covenant of grace God
   hath promised that he will work in us what he requires of us), -- that
   here mentioned is clearly an evidence of somewhat of the first kind, --
   of that goodness that God in the covenant doth promise to bestow.
   Though perhaps words of the future tense may sometimes have an
   imperative construction, where the import of the residue of the words
   enforces such a sense, yet because it may be so in some place therefore
   it is so in this place, and that therefore these words are not a
   promise that the Spirit shall not depart, but an injunction to take
   care that it do not depart, as Mr Goodwin will have it, is a weak
   inference; and the close of the words will by no means be wrested to
   speak significantly to any such purpose, "Saith the Lord, from
   henceforth and for ever," which plainly make the words promissory, and
   an engagement of God himself to them to whom they are spoken. So that
   the interpretation of these words, "This is my covenant with them," by
   Mr Goodwin, chap. xi. sect. 4, p. 227, -- "That covenant of perpetual
   grace and mercy which I made with them requireth this of them, in order
   to the performance of it on my part, that they quench not my Spirit
   which I have put into them," -- doth plainly invert the intendment of
   God in them, and substitute what is tacitly required as our duty into
   the room of what is expressly promised as his grace. Observe then, --

   2. That as no promise of God given to believers is either apt of itself
   to ingenerate, or by them to be received under, such an absurd notion
   of being made good whatsoever their deportment be, it being the nature
   of all the promises of God to frame and mould them to whom they are
   given into all holiness and purity, 2 Cor. vii. 1, -- and this in
   especial is a promise of the principal author and cause of all
   holiness, to be continued to them, and is impossible to be apprehended
   under any such foolish supposal, -- so also that this promise is
   absolute, and not conditional, can neither be colourably gainsaid nor
   the contrary probably affirmed. So that the strength of Mr Goodwin's
   two next exceptions, -- 1. "That this cannot be a promise of
   perseverance unto true believers, whatsoever their deportment shall
   be;" and, 2. "That it must be conditional, which cannot," as he saith,
   "be reasonably gainsaid," -- the first of them not looking towards our
   persuasion in this thing, and the latter being not in the least put
   upon the proof, is but very weakness; for what condition of this
   promise, I pray, can be imagined? God promises his Spirit of holiness,
   that sanctifieth us and worketh all holiness in us; and therewith the
   holy word of the gospel, which is also sanctifying, John xvii. 17; and
   that they shall abide with us for ever. It is the continuance of the
   presence of God with us for our holiness that is here promised. On what
   condition shall this be supposed to depend? Is it in case we continue
   holy? Who seeth not the vanity of interserting any condition? "I will
   be with you by my Spirit and word for ever, to keep you holy, provided
   you continue holy!"

   3. It is a hard task, to seek to squeeze a condition out of those
   gracious words in the beginning of the verse, "As for me," which Junius
   renders de me autem, -- words wherein God graciously reveals himself as
   the sole author of this great blessing promised, it being a work of his
   own, which he accomplisheth upon the account of his free grace; and
   therefore God signally placed that expression in the entrance of the
   promise, that we may know whom to look unto for the fulfilling thereof.
   And it is yet a farther corruption to say, "That As for me,' is as much
   as, For my part, I will deal bountifully with them, provided they do so
   and so, what I require from them,'?" which is Mr Goodwin's
   interpretation of the words; for of this supposition there is not one
   word in the text as incumbent on them to whom this promise is made in
   contradistinction to what God here promiseth; yea, he promiseth them,
   at least in the root and principle, whatsoever is required of them. Let
   it be that "As for me," is, "As for my part, I will do what here is
   promised," and there is an end of this debate.

   4. The persons to whom this promise is made are called "thee" and "thy
   seed," -- that is, all those and only those with whom God is a God in
   covenant. God here minds them of the first making of this covenant with
   Abraham and his seed, Gen. xvii. 7. Now, who are this seed of Abraham?
   Not all his carnal posterity, not the whole nation of the Jews; which
   is the last subterfuge invented by our author to evade the force of our
   argument from this place. Our Saviour not only denies, but also proves
   by many arguments, that the Pharisees and their followers, who
   doubtless were of the nation of the Jews and the carnal seed of
   Abraham, were not the children of Abraham in this sense, nor his seed,
   but rather the devil's, John viii. 39-44. And the apostle disputes and
   argues the same case, Rom. iv. 9-12, and proves undeniably that it is
   believers only, whether circumcised or uncircumcised, whether Jews or
   Gentiles, that are this seed of Abraham and heirs of the promise. So,
   plainly, Gal. iii. 7, "Know ye therefore that they which are of faith,
   the same are the children of Abraham;" and then he concludes again, as
   the issue of his debate, verse 9, "So then they which be of faith are
   blessed with faithful Abraham." And this is the sum of what Mr Goodwin
   objects unto this testimony, in our case, to the perpetual abiding of
   the Spirit with the saints.

   The force, then, of this promise, and the influence it hath into the
   establishment of the truth we have in hand, will not be evaded and
   turned aside by affirming "that it is made to the whole people of
   Israel:" for besides that the Spirit of the Lord could not be said to
   be in the ungodly, rejected part of them, nor his word in their mouth,
   there is not the least, in text or context, to intimate such an extent
   of this promise as to the object of it: and it is very weakly attempted
   to be proved from Paul's accommodation and interpretation of the verse
   foregoing, "And the Redeemer shall come to Zion," etc., in Rom. xi. 26;
   for it is most evident and indisputable, to any one who shall but once
   cast an eye upon that place, that the apostle accommodates and applies
   these words to none but only those who shall be saved, being turned
   away from ungodliness to Christ; which are only the seed before
   described. And those he calls "All Israel," either in the spiritual
   sense of the word, as taken for the chosen Israel of God, or else
   indefinitely for that nation, upon the account of those plentiful
   fruits which the gospel shall find amongst them, when they shall "fear
   the Lord and his goodness in the latter days," Hos. iii. 5.

   5. This, then, is a promise equally made unto all believers: it is to
   all that are in covenant; neither is there any thing that is of
   peculiar importance to any sort of believers, of any time, or age, or
   dispensation, therein comprised. It equally respecteth all to whom the
   Lord extends his covenant of grace. Certainly the giving of the Spirit
   of grace is not inwrapped in any promise that may be "of private
   interpretation," the concernment of all the saints of God lying
   therein. It cannot but be judged a needless labour to give particular
   instances in a thing so generally known in the word. Though the
   expressions differ, the matter of this promise is the same with that
   given to Abraham, Gen. xvii. 7, the Holy Spirit being the great
   blessing of the covenant, and bestowed on all and every one, and only
   on them, whom God hath graciously taken into covenant from the
   foundation of the world.

   Mr Goodwin then labours in the fire in what he farther objects, sect.
   6, "That this promise exhibiteth and holds forth some new grace or
   favour, which God hath not vouchsafed formerly either unto the persons
   to whom the said promise is now made, or to any others; but for the
   grace or favour of final perseverance, it is nothing (at least in the
   opinion of our adversaries) but what is common to all true believers,
   and what God hath conferred upon one and other of this generation from
   the beginning of the world."

   Ans. The emphasis here put upon it doth not denote it to be a new
   promise, but a great one; not that it was never given before, but that
   it is now solemnly renewed, for the consolation and establishment of
   the church. If wherever we find a solemn promise made, and confirmed,
   and ratified, to the church, we must thence conclude that no saints
   were before made partakers of the mercy of that promise, we must also,
   in particular, conclude that no one ever had his sins pardoned before
   the giving of that solemn promise, Jer. xxxi. 34.

   6. We say that the grace of perseverance is such as believers may
   expect, not upon the account of any thing in themselves, nor of the
   dignity of the state whereunto by grace they are exalted, hut merely on
   this bottom and foundation, that it is freely promised of God, who hath
   also discovered that rise and fountain of his gracious promise to lie
   in his eternal love towards them; so that they can lay no more claim
   unto it than to any other grace whatsoever. When we have the assurance
   given by any promise of God, to say that what is promised of him may be
   expected of course, is an expression that fell from Mr Goodwin when, in
   the heat of disputation, his thoughts were turned aside from the
   consideration of what it is to mix the promises of God with faith.

   7. Whereas this is given in for the sense of the words, "That God will
   advance the dispensation of his grace and goodness towards or among his
   people to such an excellency and height that, if they prove not
   extremely unworthy, they shall have of the Spirit and word of God
   abundantly amongst them, and consequently abundance of peace and
   happiness for ever," it is most apparent that not any thing of the mind
   of God in the words is reached in this gloss; for, --

   (1.) That condition, "If they prove not extremely unworthy," is
   extremely unworthily inserted, the promise being an engagement of God
   to keep and preserve them to whom it is made, by his Spirit, from being
   so. The Spirit is given and continued to them for that very purpose.

   (2.) It is supposed to be given to all the nation of the Jews, when it
   is expressly made to the church and seed in covenant.

   (3.) It carries the mercy promised no higher than outward
   dispensations, when the words expressly mention the Spirit already
   received.

   Evident it is that the whole grace, love, kindness, and mercy, of this
   eminent promise, and consequently the whole covenant of grace, is
   enervated by this corrupting gloss. Do men think, indeed, that all the
   mercy of the covenant of grace consists in such tenders and offers as
   here are intimated? that it all lies in outward endearments, and such
   dealings with men as may seem to be suited to win upon them? and that,
   as to the real exhibition of it, it is wholly suspended upon the
   unstable, uncertain, frail wills of men? The Scripture seems to hold
   out something farther of more efficacy. [197] The design of these
   exceptions is indeed to exclude all the effectual grace of God,
   promised in Jesus Christ, upon the account that the things which he
   promiseth to work in us thereby are the duties which he requireth of
   us.

   In sum, these are the exceptions which are given in to this testimony
   of God concerning the abiding of the Spirit with them on whom he is
   bestowed and for whom he is procured, to whom he is sent by Jesus
   Christ. And this is the interpretation of the words, "?As for me,' for
   my part, or as much as in me lieth, this is my covenant,' I will deal
   bountifully and graciously with them,' the whole nation of the Jews. My
   Spirit that is in thee,' that they ought to take care that they
   entertain and retain, and not walk so extremely unworthily that he
   should depart from them." The residue of the words, wherein the main
   emphasis of them doth lie, is left untouched.

   The import, then, of this promise is the same with that of the promises
   insisted on before, with especial reference to the Holy Spirit,
   procured for us and given unto us by Christ. The stability and
   establishing grace of the covenant is here called the "covenant," as
   sundry other particular mercies of it are also. Of the covenant of
   grace in Christ, the blessed Spirit to dwell in us and rest upon us is
   the main and principal promise. This, for our consolation, is renewed
   again and again in the Old and New Testament. As a Spirit of
   sanctification, he is given to men to make them believe; and as a
   Spirit of adoption, upon their believing. In either sense, God, even
   the Father, who takes us into covenant in Jesus Christ, affirms here
   that he shall never depart from us; which is our first testimony in the
   case in hand. With whom the Spirit abides, and whilst he abides with
   them, they cannot utterly forsake God nor be forsaken of him; for they
   who have the Spirit of God are the children of God, sons and heirs: but
   God hath promised that his Spirit shall abide with believers for ever,
   as hath been clearly evinced from the text under consideration, with a
   removal of all exceptions put in thereto.

   The second witness we have of the constant abode and residence of this
   Spirit, bestowed on them which believe, is that of the Son, who assures
   his disciples of it: John xiv. 16, "I will," saith he, "pray the
   Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with
   you for ever." As our Saviour gives a rule of interpretation expressly
   of his prayers for believers, that he did in them intend not only the
   men of that present generation, but all that should believe to the end
   of the world, (John xvii. 20, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for
   them also which shall believe on me through their word"): so is it a
   rule equally infallible for the interpretation of the gracious promises
   which he made to his disciples, that are not peculiarly appropriated to
   their season and work (in which yet, as to the general love,
   faithfulness, and kindness, manifested and revealed in them, the
   concernments of the saints in all succeeding ages do lie); they are
   proper to all believers as such. For whom he did equally intercede, to
   them he makes promises alike. They belong no less to us, on whom, in an
   especial manner, the ends of the world are fallen, than to those who
   first followed him in the regeneration. Let us, then, attend to the
   testimony in this place (and as he shall be pleased to increase our
   faith, mix it therewithal), that the Spirit he procureth for us and
   sends to us shall abide with us for ever; and whilst the Spirit of the
   Lord is with us we are his. Doubtless, it is no easy task to raise up
   any pretended plea against the evidence given in by this witness, the
   Amen, the great and faithful Witness in heaven. He tells us that he
   will send the Spirit, to abide with us for ever; and therein speaks to
   the whole of the case in hand and question under debate. All we say is,
   that the Spirit of God shall abide with believers for ever. Christ says
   so too; and in the issue, whatever becomes of us, he will appear to be
   one against whom there is no rising up.

   Against this testimony it is objected by Mr Goodwin, chap. xi. sect.
   14, p. 234: "This promise," saith he, "concerning the abiding of this
   other Comforter for ever must be conceived to be made either to the
   apostles personally considered, or else to the whole body of the
   church, of which they were principal members. If the first of these be
   admitted, then it will not follow that because the apostles had the
   perpetual residence of the Spirit with them and in them, therefore
   every particular believer hath the like; no more than it will follow
   that because the apostles were infallible in their judgments, through
   the teachings of the Spirit in them, therefore every believer is
   infallible upon the same account also. If the latter be admitted,
   neither will it follow that every believer, or every member of the
   church, must needs have the residence of the Spirit with them for ever.
   There are principal privileges appropriated to corporations, which
   every particular member of them cannot claim. The church may have the
   residence of the Spirit of God with her for ever, and yet every present
   member thereof lose his interest and part in him; yea, the abiding of
   the Spirit in the apostles themselves was not absolutely promised, John
   xv. 10."

   Ans. 1. The design of this discourse is to prove that this promise is
   not made to believers in general, or those who through the word are
   brought to believe in Christ in all generations to the end of the
   world, and consequently that they' have no promise of the Spirit's
   abiding with them; for that is the thing opposed. And this is part of
   the doctrine that tends to their consolation and improvement in
   holiness! What thanks they will give to the authors of such an eminent
   discovery, when it shall be determined that they have deserved well of
   them and the truth of God, I know not; especially when it shall be
   considered that not only this, but all other promises uttered by Christ
   to his apostles, -- as we had thought, not for their own behoof alone,
   but also for the use of the church in all ages, -- are tied up in their
   tendency and use to the men of that generation, and to the employment
   to which they to whom he spoke were designed. But let us see whether
   these things are so or no. I say, --

   2. There is not any necessary cause of that disjunctive proposition, --
   The promise of the perpetual residence of the Spirit is made "either to
   the apostles personally, or to the whole body of the church." By the
   rule formerly given for the interpretation of these promises of Christ,
   it appears that what in this kind was made to the one was also given to
   the other; and how Mr Goodwin will enforce any necessary conclusion
   from this distinction, framed by himself for his own purpose, I know
   not. The promise was made both to these and those, the apostles and all
   other believers, because to the apostles as believers.

   3. The making of the promise to the apostles personally doth not argue
   that it was made to them as apostles, but only that it was made to
   their persons or to them, though under another qualification, namely,
   of believing. It is given to them personally as believers, and so to
   all believers whatever. This also sets at liberty and plainly cashiers
   the comparison instituted between the apostles' infallibility as
   apostles and their sanctifying grace as believers, by the Spirit of
   grace given for that end. The apostles' infallibility, we confess, was
   from the Spirit; for they, as other holy men of old, wrote as they were
   moved by the Spirit of God, 2 Pet. i. 21: but that this was a distinct
   gift bestowed on them as apostles, and not the teaching of the Spirit
   of grace, which is given to all believers,1 John ii. 27, we need not
   contend to prove.

   Besides, to what end doth he contend that it was made to the apostles
   in the sense urged and by us insisted on, seeing he denies it in the
   close of this section, and chooseth rather to venture upon an
   opposition unto that commonly received persuasion that the apostles of
   Christ (the son of perdition only excepted) had an absolute promise of
   perseverance, than to acknowledge that which would prove so prejudicial
   and ruinous to his cause, as he knows the confession of such a promise
   made to them would inevitably be? He contends not, I say, about the
   sense of the promise, but would fain divert it from other believers (at
   the entrance of the section) by limiting it to the apostles; but
   considering afterward better of the matter, and remembering that the
   concession of an absolute promise of perseverance to any one saint
   whatever would evidently root up and cast to the ground the goodliest
   engine that he hath sot up against the truth he opposeth, he suits it
   (in the close of the section) to an evasion holding better
   correspondency with its associates in this undertaking.

   4. I wonder what chimerical church he hath found out, to which promises
   are made and privileges granted otherwise than upon the account of the
   persons whereof it is constituted. Suppose, I pray, that promises of
   the residence of the Spirit for ever with it be made to the church,
   which is made up of so many members, and that all these members, every
   one, should lose their interest in it, what subject of that promise
   would remain? What universal is this, that hath a real existence of
   itself and by itself, in abstraction from its particulars, in which
   alone it hath its being? or what whole is that which is preserved in
   the destruction and dissolution of all its essentially constituent
   parts? The promises, then, that are made to the church are of two
   sorts:-- (1.) Of such grace and mercies as, whether inherent or
   relative, have their residence in and respect unto particular persons
   as such. Of this sort are all the promises of grace, of sanctification,
   as also of justification, etc.; which are all things of men's personal
   spiritual interest. The promises made to the church of this nature are
   made unto it merely as consisting of so many, and those elected,
   redeemed persons, whose right and interest as those individual persons
   they are. (2.) Of all such good things as are the exurgency of the
   collected state of the saints, in reference to their spiritual,
   invisible communion, or visible gathering into a church constituted
   according to the mind of Christ and his appointment in the gospel. And
   these also are all of them founded on the former, and depend wholly
   upon them, and are resolved into them. All promises whatever, then,
   made to the church, the body of Christ, do not respect it primarily as
   a corporation, which is the second notion of it, but as consisting of
   those particular believers; much less as a chimerical universal, having
   a subsistence in and by itself, abstracted from its particulars. This
   evasion, then, notwithstanding, this promise of our Saviour doth still
   continue to press its testimony concerning the perpetual residence of
   the Holy Spirit with believers.

   The scope of the place enforces that acceptation of these words which
   we insist upon. Our blessed Saviour, observing the trouble and
   disconsolation of his followers upon the apprehension of his departure
   from them, stirs them up to a better hope and confidence by many
   gracious promises and engagements of what would and should be the issue
   of his being taken away, John xiv. 1. He bids them free their hearts
   from trouble, and in the next words tells them that the way whereby it
   was to be done was by acting faith on the promises of his Father, and
   on those which in his Father's name he had made and was to make unto
   them. Of these he mentions many in the following verses, whereof the
   fountain head and spring is that of giving them the Comforter, not to
   abide with them for a season, as he had done with his bodily presence,
   but to continue with them as a comforter (and consequently to the
   discharging of his whole dispensation towards believers) for ever. He
   speaks to them as believers, as disconsolate, dejected believers,
   quickening their faith by exhortations; and gives them this promise as
   a solid foundation of peace and composedness of spirit, which he
   exhorted them unto. And if our Saviour intendeth any thing but what the
   words import, -- namely, that he will give his Holy Spirit as a
   comforter, to abide with them for ever, -- the promise hath not the
   least suitableness to relieve them in their distress, nor to accomplish
   the end for which it was given them. But against this it is excepted,
   chap. xi. sect. 13, p. 233:--

   1. "Evident it is that our Saviour doth not in this place oppose the
   abiding or remaining of the Holy Ghost to his own departure from the
   hearts or souls of men into which he is framed or come, but to his
   departure out of the world by death, which was now at hand."

   Ans. This is a weighty observation! yet withal it is evident that he
   opposeth the abiding of the Spirit with them as a comforter to his own
   bodily presence with them for that end. His was for a season, the other
   to endure for ever. And I desire to know how our Saviour Christ comes
   or enters into the souls or hearts of men but by his Spirit, and how
   these things come here to be distinguished. But, --

   2. He says, "By the abiding of the Comforter with them for ever, he
   doth not mean his perpetual abode in their hearts, or the heart of any
   particular man, but his constant abiding in the world, in and with the
   gospel and the children thereof: in respect of which he saith of
   himself elsewhere, I am with you always, even to the end of the world;'
   as if he should have said, This the purpose of my Father in sending me
   into the world requires that I should make no long stay in it. I am now
   upon my return. But when I come to my Father, I will intercede for you,
   and he will send you another Comforter:, upon better terms for staying
   and continuing with you than those on which I came; for he shall be
   sent, not to be taken out of the world by death, but to make his
   residence with and among you, my friends and faithful ones, for ever.'
   Now, from such an abiding of the Holy Ghost with them as this cannot be
   inferred his perpetual abiding with any one personal believer
   determinately, much less with every one."

   Ans. 1. It was evident before that this promise was made to the
   disciples of Christ as believers, to quicken and strengthen their
   failing, drooping faith, in and under that great trial of losing the
   presence of their Master which they were to undergo; and being made
   unto them as believers, though upon a particular occasion, is made to
   all believers for "a quatenus ad omne valet argumentum."

   2. It is no less evident that, according to the interpretation here,
   without the least attempt of proof, importunately suggested, the
   promise is no way suited to give the least encouragement or consolation
   unto the disciples, in reference to the condition upon the account
   whereof it is now so solemnly given them. It is all one as if our
   Saviour should have said, "You are sadly troubled indeed, yea, your
   hearts are filled with trouble and fear, because I have told you that I
   must leave you. Be not so dejected. I have kept you whilst I have been
   with you in the world, and now I go away, and will send the Holy Spirit
   into the world; and, whatsoever becomes of you, or any of you, whether
   ye have any consolation or no, he shall abide in the world, perhaps,
   with some or other (that is, if any do believe, which it may be some
   will, it may be not) until the end and consummation of it."

   3. Is this promise of sending the Holy Spirit given to the apostles, or
   is it not? If you say not, assign whom it is given or made unto. Christ
   spake it to them, and doubtless they thought he intended them, and it
   was wholly suited to their condition. If it were made unto them, is it
   not in the letter of the promise affirmed that the Spirit shall abide
   with them for ever to whom it was given? If there be any subject of
   this promise in receiving the Spirit, he must of necessity keep his
   residence and abode with it for ever. The whole design of this section
   is to put the persons to whom this promise is made into the dark, that
   we may not see them; yea, to deny that it is made to any persons at
   all, as the recipient subject of the grace thereof, he tells you that"
   he abides in the world." How, I pray? Doubtless not as the unclean
   spirit, that goes up and down in dry places, seeking rest and finding
   none. Christ promiseth his Spirit to his church, not to the world, --
   to dwell in the hearts of his, not to wander up and down. Nay, he
   abides with the apostles and their spiritual posterity; that is,
   believers, in our Saviour's interpretation, John xvii. 20. Are they,
   then, and their posterity, (that is, believers), the persons to whom
   this promise is made, and who are concerned in it, with whom, as he is
   promised, he is to abide? This you can scarcely find out an answer to
   in the whole discourse. He tells you, indeed, the Holy Ghost was not to
   die, with such other rare notions; but for any persons particularly
   intended in this promise, we are still in the dark.

   3. He tells us, "That from such an abiding of the Holy Ghost with them
   as this, cannot be enforced his perpetual abiding with any one person
   determinately." But what kind of abiding it is that he intends is not
   easily apprehended. If on the account of this promise he is given to
   any person, on the same account he is to abide with the same person for
   ever. That which he seems to intend is the presence of the Spirit in
   the administration of the word, to make it effectual unto them to whom
   it is delivered, when the promise is to give him as a comforter to them
   on whom he is bestowed. But he adds, sect. 14, --

   4. "And lastly, The particle hina doth not always import the certainty
   of the thing spoken of, by way of event (no, not when the speech is of
   God himself), but ofttimes the intention only of the agent: so that the
   words, That he may abide with you for ever do not imply an absolute
   necessity of his abiding with them for ever, but only this, that it
   should be the intent of him that should send him, and that he would
   send him in such a way, that, if they were true to their own interest,
   they might retain him and have his abode with them for ever. Turn the
   words any way, with any tolerable congruity, either to the scope of the
   place, manner of Scripture expression, principles of reason, and the
   doctrine of perseverance will be found to have nothing in them."

   Ans. 1. This is the pansophon pharmakon, that, when all medicines will
   not heal, must serve to skin the wound given our adversaries' cause by
   the sword of the word: "The promise is made unto believers, indeed; but
   on such and such conditions as on the account whereof it may never be
   accomplished towards them." 2. This no way suits Mr Goodwin's
   interpretation of the place formerly mentioned and insisted on. If it
   be, as was said, only a promise of sending his Spirit into the world
   for the end by him insinuated, doubtless the word hina must denote the
   event of the thing, and not an intention only that might fail of
   accomplishment; for let all or any individuals behave themselves how
   they will, it is certain, as to the accomplishment and event, that the
   Spirit of God shall be continued in the world, in the sense pleaded
   for. But it is not what is congruous to his own thoughts, but what may
   oppose ours (that is, the plain and obvious sense of the words), that
   he is concerned to make use of. It being not the sense of the place,
   but an escaping our argument from it, that lies in his design, he cares
   not how many contrary and inconsistent interpretations he gives of it.
   "Hæc non successit, aliâ aggrediemur viâ." The word hina denotes, as is
   confessed, the intention of Christ in sending the Spirit; that is, that
   he intends to send him to believers, so as that he should abide with
   them for ever. Now, besides the impossibility in general that the
   intention of God, or of the Lord Christ, as God and man, should be
   frustrate, whence in particular should it come to pass he should fail
   in this his intention? "I will send you the Holy Spirit, to abide with
   you for ever;" that is, "I intend to send you the Holy Spirit, that he
   may abide with you for ever." What, now, should hinder this? "Why, it
   is given them upon condition that they be true to their own interest,
   and take care to retain him.'?" What is that, I pray? "Why, that they
   continue in faith, obedience, repentance, and close walking with God."
   But to what end is it that he is promised unto them? is it not to teach
   them, to work in them faith, obedience, repentance, and close walking
   with God, to sanctify them throughout, and preserve them blameless to
   the end, making them "meet for the inheritance of the saints in light?
   "In case they obey, believe, etc., the Holy Ghost is promised unto
   them, to abide with them, to cause them to obey, believe, repent, etc."
   3. The intention of Christ for the sending of the Spirit, and his
   abiding for ever with them to whom he is sent, is but one and the same;
   and if any frustration of his intention do fall out, it may most
   probably interpose as to his sending of the Spirit, not as to the
   Spirit's continuance with them to whom he is sent, which is asserted
   absolutely upon the account of his sending him. He sends him hina mene.
   His abode is the end of his sending; which, if he be sent, shall be
   obtained.

   Upon the whole, doubtless, it will be found that the doctrine of
   perseverance finds so much for its establishment in this place of
   Scripture and promise of our Saviour, that by no art or cunning it will
   be prevailed withal to let go its interest therein. And though many
   attempts be made to turn and wrest this testimony of our Saviour
   several ways, and those contrary to and inconsistent with one another,
   yet it abides to look straight forward to the proof and confirmation of
   the truth, that lies not only in the womb and sense of it, but in the
   very mouth and literal expression of it also. I suppose it is evident
   to all that Mr Goodwin knows not what to say to it, nor what sense to
   fix upon. At first it is made to the apostles, not to all believers;
   then, when this will not serve the turn, there being a concession in
   that interpretation destructive to his whole cause, it is made as a
   privilege to the church, not to any individual persons; but yet, for
   fear that this privilege must be vested in some individuals, it is
   denied that it is made to any, but only is a promise of the Spirit's
   abode in the world with the word; but, perhaps some thoughts coming
   upon him that this will no way suit the scope of the place, nor be
   suited to the intendment of Christ, it is lastly added, that let it be
   made to whom it will, it is conditional, though there be not the least
   intimation of any condition in the text or context, and that
   [condition] by him assigned be coincident with the thing itself
   promised! But hereof so far; and so our second testimony. The testimony
   of the Son abides still by the truth for the confirmation whereof it is
   produced; and in the mouth of these two witnesses, the abiding of the
   Spirit with believers to the end is established.

   Add hereunto, thirdly, The testimony of the third that bears witness in
   heaven, and who also comes near and bears witness to this truth in the
   hearts of believers, even of the Spirit itself; and so I shall leave it
   sealed under the testimony of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. As the
   other two gave in their testimony in a word of promise, so the Spirit
   doth in a real work of performance; wherein, as he bears a distinct
   testimony of his own, the saints baying a peculiar communion and
   fellowship with him therein, so he is, as the common seal of Father and
   Son, set unto that truth which by their testimony they have confirmed.
   There are, indeed, sundry things whereby he confirms and establisheth
   the saints in the assurance of his abode with them for ever. I shall at
   present mention that one eminent work of his, which, being given unto
   them, he doth accomplish to this very end and purpose, and that is his
   sealing of them to the day of redemption; -- a work it is, often in the
   Scripture mentioned, and still upon the account of assuring the
   salvation of believers: 2 Cor. i. 22, "Who hath also sealed us." Having
   mentioned the certainty, unchangeableness, and efficacy, of all the
   promises of God in Christ, and the end to be accomplished and brought
   about by them, -- namely, the "glory of God in believers" (verse 20,
   "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the
   glory of God by us"), -- the apostle acquaints the saints with one
   foundation of the security of their interest in those promises, whereby
   the end mentioned, "the glory of God by them," should be accomplished.
   This he ascribes to the efficacy of the Spirit, bestowed on them in
   sundry works of his grace, which he reckoneth, verses 21, 22. Among
   them this is one, that he seals them. As to the nature of this sealing,
   and what that act of the Spirit of grace is that is so called, I shall
   not now insist upon it. The end and use of sealing is more aimed at in
   this expression than the nature of it, -- what it imports than wherein
   it consists. Being a term forensical, and translated from the use and
   practice of men in their civil transactions, the use and end of it may
   easily, from the original rise thereof, be demonstrated. Sealing
   amongst men hath a twofold use:-- First, To give secrecy and security
   (in things that are under present consideration) to the things sealed.
   And this is the first use of sealing, by a seal set upon the things
   sealed. Of this kind of sealing chiefly have we that long discourse of
   Salmasius, in the vindication of his Jus Atticum against the
   animadversions of Heraldus. And, secondly, To give an assurance or
   faith for what is, by them that seal, to be done. In the first sense
   are things sealed up in bags and in treasuries, that they may be kept
   safe, none daring to break open their seals. In the latter are all
   promissory engagements confirmed, established, and made unalterable,
   wherein men, either in conditional compacts or testamentary
   dispositions, do oblige themselves. These are the Sigilla appensa that
   are yet in use in all deeds, enfeoffments, and the like instruments in
   law. And with men, if this be done, their engagements are accounted
   inviolable. And because all men have not that truth, faithfulness, and
   honesty, as to make good even their sealed engagements, the whole race
   of mankind hath consented unto the establishment of laws and governors,
   amongst others to this end, that all men may be compelled to stand to
   their sealed promises, Hence, whatsoever the nature of it be, and in
   what particular soever it doth consist, the end and use of this work,
   in this special acceptation, is taken evidently in the latter sense
   from its use amongst men. Expressed it is upon the mention of the
   promises, 2 Cor. i. 20. To secure believers of their certain and
   infallible accomplishment unto them, the apostle tells them of this
   sealing of the Spirit, whereby the promises are irrevocably confirmed
   unto them to whom they are made, as is the case among the sons of men.
   Suitably, Eph. i. 13, he saith they are "sealed by the Holy Spirit of
   promise;" that is, who is promised unto us, and who confirms to us all
   the promises of God, Heb. ix. 14. That the other end of sealing also,
   safety and preservation, is designed therein, secondarily, appears from
   the appointed season whereunto this sealing shall be effectual. It is
   "to the day of redemption," Eph. iv. 30; until the saints are brought
   to the enjoyment of the full, whole, and complete purchase made for
   them by Christ when he "obtained for them eternal redemption." And this
   is a real testimony which the Holy Spirit gives to his own abiding with
   the saints for ever. The work he accomplisheth in them and upon them is
   on set purpose designed to assure them hereof, and to confirm them in
   the faith of it.

   Unto an argument from this sealing of the Spirit, thus proposed, "Those
   who are sealed shall certainly be saved," Mr Goodwin excepts sundry
   things, chap. xi. sect. 42, p. 255-257; which, because they are applied
   to blur that interpretation of the words of the Holy Ghost which I have
   insisted on, I shall briefly remove out of the way, that they may be no
   farther offensive to the meanest sealed one.

   He answers, then, first, by distinguishing the major proposition thus:
   "They who are sealed shall certainly be saved with such a sealing which
   is unchangeable by any intervenience whatsoever, as of sin and
   apostasy, so that they cannot lose their faith; but if the sealing be
   only such the continuance whereof depends on the faith of the sealed,
   and consequently may be reversed or withdrawn, it no way proves that
   all they who are partakers of it must of necessity retain their faith.
   Therefore," saith he, secondly, "we answer farther, that the sealing
   with the Spirit spoken of is the latter kind of sealing, not the
   former, -- that is, which depends upon the faith of those that are
   sealed, -- as in the beginning or first impression of it, so in the
   duration or continuance of it; and consequently there is none other
   certainty of its continuance but only the continuance of the said
   faith, which being uncertain, the sealing depending on it must needs be
   uncertain also. That the sealing mentioned depends upon the faith of
   the sealed is evident, because it is said, In whom also, after ye
   believed, ye were sealed with the Spirit of promise.'?"

   Ans. I dare say there is no honest man that would take it well at the
   hand of Mr Goodwin, or any else, that should attempt, by distinctions,
   or any other way, to alleviate or take off the credit of his truth and
   honesty in the performance of all those things whereunto, and for the
   confirmation whereof, he hath set his seal. What acceptation a like
   attempt in reference to the Spirit of God is like to find with him, he
   may do well to consider. In the meantime, he prevails not with us to
   discredit this work of his grace in the least; for, --

   1. This supposal of such interveniencies of sin and wickedness in the
   saints as are inconsistent with the life of faith and the favour of
   God, as also of apostasy, are but a poor, mean insinuation for the
   begging of the thing in question, which will never be granted on any
   such terms. An interveniency of apostasy, -- that is, defection from
   the faith, -- is not handsomely supposed whilst men continue in the
   faith.

   2. That which is given for the confirmation of their faith, and on set
   purpose to add continuance to it, as this is, cannot depend on the
   condition of the continuance of their faith. The Holy Ghost seals them
   to the day of redemption, confirming and establishing thereby an
   infallible continuance of their faith; but, it seems, upon condition of
   their continuance in the faith. Cui fini? Of what hitherto is said,
   this is the sum: "If they who are sealed apostatize into sin and
   wickedness, they shall not be saved, notwithstanding that they have
   been sealed." And this must pass for an answer to our argument, proving
   that they cannot so apostatize because they are sealed on purpose to
   preserve and secure them from that condition. Men need not go far to
   seek for answers to any argument, if such as these (pure beggings of
   the thing in question and argued) will suffice.

   3. Neither doth "the beginning or first impression of the sealing"
   depend upon their faith any otherwise but as believers are the subject
   of it, which is not to have any kind of dependence upon it, either as
   to its nature or use. Neither doth that place of the apostle, Eph. i.
   13, "After that ye believed ye were sealed," prove any such thing,
   unless this general axiom be first established, that all things which
   in order of nature are before and after have the connection of cause
   and effect, or at least of condition and event, between them. It
   proves, indeed, that their believing is in order of nature antecedent
   to their sealing, respecting the use of it here mentioned; but this
   proves not at all that faith is the condition of sealing, the bestowing
   of faith and the grant of this seal to establish it being both acts
   depending merely, solely, and distinctly, on the free grace of God in
   Christ. Though faith in order of nature go before hope, yet is no hope
   bestowed on men on the condition of believing. The truth is, both faith
   and sealing, and all other spiritual mercies, as to the goodwill of God
   bestowing them, are at once granted us in Jesus Christ; but as to our
   reception of them, and the actual instating of our souls in the
   enjoyment of them, or rather as to the exerting of themselves in us,
   they have that order which either the nature of the things themselves
   requires, or the sovereign will of God hath allotted to them. Neither
   doth sealing bespeak any grace in us, but a peculiar improvement of the
   grace bestowed on us. So that, --

   4. We refuse the answer suggested by Mr Goodwin, "That sealing depends"
   (that is, in his sense) "upon believing, as to the first grant of it,
   but not as to the continuance thereof," and reject his supposal of "one
   that hath truly believed making shipwreck of his faith," as too
   importune a cry, or begging of that which it is evident cannot be
   proved. I shall add only, that Mr Goodwin granting here the continuance
   of faith to be a thing "uncertain," which is a word to express a very
   weak probability of a thing, is much fallen off from his former
   confident expression of the "only remote possibility" of believers
   falling away. That their falling away should be scarcely possible, and
   yet their continuance in the faith very uncertain, is somewhat uncouth.
   But this is the foundation of that great consolation which Mr Goodwin's
   doctrine is so pregnant and teeming withal, that it even groans to be
   delivered. "Their continuance in believing is uncertain; therefore they
   must needs rejoice and be filled with consolation." But he answers
   farther:--

   "I answer farther, by way of exception, that the sealing we speak of is
   neither granted by God unto believers themselves upon any such terms as
   that upon no occasion or occasions whatsoever, as of the greatest and
   most horrid sins committed and long continued in by them, or the like,
   it should ever be interrupted or effaced; for this is contrary to many
   plain texts of Scripture, and particularly unto all those where either
   apostates from God, or evil-doers and workers of iniquity, are
   threatened with the loss of God's favour and of the inheritance of
   life, such as Heb. x., etc."

   Ans. 1. It is the intent and purpose of God that the sealing of
   believers shall abide with them for ever; whence comes it to pass that
   his purposes do not stand, and that he doth not fulfil his pleasure?
   "It is not that he changeth, but that men are changed; -- that is, the
   beginning of the change is not in him; occasion of it is administered
   unto him by men." When his sealing is removed from believers, doth God
   still purpose that it shall continue with them, or no? If he doth, then
   he purposeth that shall be which is not, which it is his will shall not
   be; and he continues in his vain purpose to eternity. Or, if he ceases
   to purpose, how is it that he is not changed? Such things bespeak a
   change in the sons of men, which we thought had been incompatible with
   the perfection of the divine nature, even that he should will and
   purpose one thing at one time, and another, yea the clean contrary, at
   another. "Yea, but the reason of it is, because the men concerning whom
   his purposes are do change." This salves not the immutability of God.
   Though he doth not change from any new consideration in himself and
   from himself, yet he doth from obstructions in his way and to his
   thoughts in the creatures; -- yea, instead of salving his
   unchangeableness, this is destructive to his omnipotency.

   2. This whole answer is a supposal that God may alter his purpose of
   confirming men in grace, if they be not confirmed in grace; or, that
   though God's purpose be to seal them to the day of redemption, yet they
   may not continue nor be preserved thereunto; and then God's purpose of
   their continuance ceaseth also. This is, --

   3. More evident in his second answer, by way of exception, which is
   made up of these two parts:-- first, A begging of the main, and, upon
   the matter, only thing in question, by supposing that believers may
   fall into the most horrible sins, and continue in them to the end; so
   proving, with great evidence and perspicuity, that believers may fall
   away, because they may fall away! and, second, A suggestion of his own
   judgment to the contrary, and his supposal that it is confirmed by some
   texts of Scripture; which, God assisting, shall be delivered from this
   imputation hereafter. And these two do make up so clear an answer to
   the argument in hand that a man knows not well what to reply! Let us
   take it for granted that believers may fall away, and how shall we
   prevent Mr Goodwin from proving it! But he adds farther:--

   "Believers are said to be sealed by the Holy Spirit of God against, or
   until, or for (eis) the day of redemption; because that holiness which
   is wrought in them by the Spirit of God qualifies them, puts them into
   a present and actual capacity of partaking in that joy and glory which
   the great day of the full redemption of the saints (that is, of those
   who lived and died, and shall be found such) shall bring with it; and
   it is called the earnest of their inheritance."

   Ans. How eis comes to be "against" or "for," or to denote the matter
   spoken of, and what all this is to the purpose in hand, he shows not.
   The aim of him the words are spoken of, and the uninterrupted
   continuance of the work mentioned to the end expressed, seem rather to
   be intended in the whole coherence of the words. Neither is the use of
   sealing to prepare any thing for such a time, but to secure and
   preserve it thereunto. He that hath a conveyance sealed unto him is not
   only capacitated for the present to receive the estate conveyed, but is
   principally assured of a right and title for a continued enjoyment of
   it, not to be reversed. It is not the nature of this work of the Holy
   Ghost, wherein it is coincident with other acts of his grace, but the
   particular use of it, as it is a sealing, and God's intendment by it,
   to confirm us to the day of redemption, that comes under our
   consideration. If it were a season to inquire wherein it consists, I
   suppose we should scarce close with Mr Goodwin's description of it,
   namely, "that it is a qualifying of men, and putting them in an actual
   capacity to partake of joy," etc. He is the first I know of that gave
   this description of it, and probably the last that will do so. Of the
   "earnest of the Spirit" in its proper place.

   What he adds in the last place, namely, "If the apostle's intent had
   been to inform the Ephesians that the gift of the Holy Spirit, which
   they had received from God, was the earnest of their inheritance, upon
   such terms that no unworthiness or wickedness whatsoever on their parts
   could ever hinder the actual collation of this inheritance upon them,
   he had plainly prevaricated with that most serious admonition wherein
   he addresses himself to them afterward, For this ye know, that no
   whoremonger,' etc., hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ.'?"
   This, I say, is of the same alloy with what went before; for, --

   1. Here is the same begging of the question as before, and that upon a
   twofold account:-- (1.) In supposing that believers may fall into such
   sins and unworthiness as are inconsistent with the state of acceptation
   with God; which is the very thing he hath to prove. (2.) In supposing
   that if believers are sealed up infallibly to redemption, the
   exhortations to the avoidance of sins in themselves, and to all that
   continue in them, destructive to salvation, are in vain; which is a
   figment in a case somewhat alike (as to the reason of it), rejected by
   men that knew nothing of the nature of God's promises nor his commands,
   nor the accommodation of them both to the fulfilling in believers "all
   the good pleasure of his goodness."

   2. The assurance the apostle gives of freedom from the wrath of God is
   inseparably associated with that assurance that he gives that we,
   according to the tenor of the covenant of grace, shall not be left in
   or given up to such ways as wherein that wrath is not to be avoided.

   From this latter testimony this argument also doth flow: Those who are
   sealed of God to the day of redemption shall certainly be preserved
   thereunto, their preservation being the end and aim of God in his
   sealing of them. Mr Goodwin's answer to this proposition is, "That they
   shall be so preserved in case they fall not into abominable sins and
   practices, and so apostatize from the faith;" that is, in case they be
   preserved, they shall be preserved. But wherein their preservation
   should consist, if not in their effectual deliverance from such ways
   and courses, is not declared. That all believers are so sealed, and to
   that end, as above, is the plain testimony of the Scripture; and
   therefore our conclusion is undeniably evinced.

   Thus have we, through the Lord's assistance, freed the triple testimony
   of Father, Son, and Spirit, given to the truth under consideration,
   from all objections and exceptions put in thereunto; so that we hope
   the mouth of iniquity may be stopped, and that the cause of the truth
   in hand is secured for ever. It is a fearful thing to contend with God.
   "Let God be true, but every man a liar."

   Spirit proved from the promises of it -- Express affirmations of the
   same truth -- Ps. li. 11; Rom. viii. 9, opened -- Verses 11, 15; 1 Cor.
   ii. 12; Gal. iv. 6, opened -- 2 Tim. i. 14 -- The Spirit in his

   Spirit dwells in the saints as in a temple, 1 Cor. iii. 16, vi. 19 --
   The indwelling of the Spirit farther demonstrated from the signal
   effects ascribed in the Scripture to his so doing; as, 1. Union with
   Christ -- Union with Christ, wherein it consisteth -- Union with Christ
   by the indwelling of the same Spirit in him and us -- This proved from,

   Consequences of the want of this guidance of the Spirit -- 3. The third
   thing received from the indwelling Spirit, supportment -- The way
   whereby the Spirit gives supportment: (1.) By bringing to mind the
   things spoken by Christ for their consolation, John xiv. 16, 17, 26 --
   (2.) By renewing his graces in them as to strength -- The benefits
   issuing and flowing from thence -- Restraint given by the indwelling
   Spirit, and how -- The continuance of the Spirit with believers for the
   renewal of grace proved -- John iv. 14, that promise of our Saviour at
   large opened -- The water there promised is the Spirit -- The state of
   them on whom he is bestowed -- Spiritual thirst twofold -- Isa. lxv.
   13; 1 Pet. ii. 2 -- The reasons why men cannot thirst again who have
   once drunk of the Spirit explained -- Mr G.'s exceptions considered and
   removed -- The same work farther carried on; as also the indwelling of
   the Spirit in believers farther demonstrated by the inferences made
   from thence -- The first: Our Persons temples of the Holy Ghost, to be
   disposed of in all ways of holiness -- The second: Wisdom to try
   spirits -- The ways, means, and helps, whereby the saints discern
   between the voice of Christ and the voice of Satan.

   Having showed that the Holy Spirit is purchased for us by the oblation
   of Christ, and bestowed on us through his intercession, to abide with
   us for ever, -- a truth confirmed by the unquestionable testimonies of
   the Father, Son, and Spirit, -- I shall, in the next place (I hope to
   the advantage and satisfaction of the Christian reader), a little turn
   aside to consider how and in what manner he abideth with them on whom
   he is bestowed, together with some eminent acts and effects of his
   grace, which he putteth forth and exerteth in them with whom he
   abideth, all tending to their preservation in the love and favour of
   God. A doctrine it is of no small use and importance in our walking
   with God, as we shall find in our pursuit of it. And therefore, though
   not appearing so directly argumentative and immediately subservient to
   the promotion of the dispute in hand, yet as tending to the
   establishment, guidance, and consolation, of them who do receive it,
   and to the cherishing, increasing, and strengthening of the faith
   thereof, I cannot but conceive it much conducing to the carrying on of
   the main intendment of this whole undertaking. I say, then, upon the
   purchase made of all good things for the elect by Christ, the holy and
   blessed Spirit of God is given to them, to dwell in them personally,
   for the accomplishment of all the ends and purposes of his economy
   towards them, -- to make them meet for, and to bring them unto, the
   inheritance of the saints in light: personally, I say, in our persons
   (not by assumption of our nature, but giving us mystical union with
   Christ, not personal union with himself; that is, not one personality
   with him, which is impious and blasphemous to imagine), by a gracious
   inhabitation, distinct from his essential filling all things, and his
   energetical operation of all things as he will, as shall afterwards be
   declared. Now, this being a doctrine of pure revelation, our
   demonstrations of it must be merely scriptural; and such (as will
   instantly appear) we have provided in great plenty. In the carrying on,
   then, of this undertaking, I shall do these two things:-- I. Produce
   some of those many texts of Scripture which are pregnant of this truth.
   II. Show what great things do issue from thence and are affirmed in
   reference thereunto, being inferences of a supposal thereof, all
   conducing to the preservation of believers in the love and favour of
   God unto the end.

   For the first, I shall refer them to four heads: unto, -- 1. Promises
   that he should so dwell in us; 2. Positive affirmations that he doth
   so; 3. Those texts that hold out his being distinguished from all his
   graces and gifts in his so doing; 4. Those that ascribe a personality
   to him in his indwelling in us. Of each sort one or two places may
   suffice.

   I. 1. The indwelling of the Spirit is the great and solemn promise of
   the covenant of grace; the manner of it we shall afterward evince:
   Ezek. xxxvi. 27, "I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to
   walk: in my statutes." In the verse foregoing he tells them, "He will
   give them a new heart, and a new spirit;" which, because it may be
   interpreted of a renewed frame of spirit (though it rather seems to be
   the renewing Spirit that is intended, as also chap. xi. 19), he
   expressly points out and differences the spirit he will give them from
   all works of grace whatsoever, in that appellation of him, "?My
   Spirit,' my Holy Spirit; him will I put within you: I will give him or
   place him in interiori vestro, in your inmost part,' in your heart; or
   in visceribus vestris, in your bowels' (as the soul is frequently
   signified by expressions of sensual things), within you.'?" In his
   giving us a new heart and new spirit, by putting in us his Spirit,
   certainly more is intended than a mere working of gracious qualities in
   our hearts by his Spirit; which he may do, and yet be no more in us
   than in the greatest blasphemer in the world. And this, in the carrying
   of it on to its accomplishment, God calls his covenant: Isa. lix. 21,
   "This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord; My Spirit that is upon
   thee shall not depart from thee;" -- "Upon thee, in thee, that dwelleth
   in thee, as was promised." And this promise is evidently renewed by the
   Lord Christ to his disciples, clearly also interpreting what that
   Spirit is which is mentioned in the promise of the covenant: Luke xi.
   13, "Your heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
   him" of him; that is, that pray to him for the Holy Spirit. Our Saviour
   instructs his disciples to ask the Holy Spirit of God upon the account
   of his being so promised; as Acts ii. 33. All our supplications are to
   be regulated by the promise, Rom. viii. 27. And surely he who (as shall
   afterward appear) did so plentifully and richly promise the bestowing
   of this Spirit on all those that believe on him, did not instruct them
   to ask for any inferior mercy and grace under that name. That Spirit
   which the Lord Christ instructs us to ask of the Father is the Spirit
   which he hath promised to bestow so on us as that he shall dwell in us.
   That the Spirit which Christ instructs us to ask for, and which himself
   promises to send unto us, is the Holy Ghost himself, the Holy Spirit of
   promise, by whom we are sealed to the day of redemption, I suppose will
   require no labour to prove; what is needful to this end shall be
   afterward insisted on.

   2. Positive affirmations that he doth so dwell in and remain with the
   saints are the second ground of the truth we assert. I shall name one
   or two testimonies of that kind: Ps. li. 11, saith David, "Take not thy
   Holy Spirit from me." It is the Spirit, and his presence as unto
   sanctification, not in respect of prophecy or any other gift whatever,
   that he is treating of with God. All the graces of the Spirit being
   almost dead and buried in him, he cries aloud that He whose they are,
   and who alone is able to revive and quicken them, may not be taken from
   him. With him, in him, he was, or he could not be taken from him. And
   though the gifts or graces of the Spirit only may be intended, where
   mention is made of giving or bestowing of him sometimes, yet when the
   saints beg of God that he would continue his Spirit with them, though
   they have grieved him and provoked him, that no more is intended but
   some gift or grace, is not so clear. I know men possessed with
   prejudice against this truth will think easily to evade these
   testimonies by the distinction of the person and graces of the Spirit.
   Wherefore, for the manner how he is with them with whom he is, the
   apostle informs us, Rom. viii. 9, "Ye are in the Spirit" (that is,
   spiritual men, opposed to being "in the flesh," -- that is, carnal,
   unregenerate, unreconciled, and enemies to God), "if so be that the
   Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
   Christ, he is none of his." Not only the thing itself is asserted, but
   the weight of our regeneration and acceptation with God through Jesus
   Christ is laid upon it. If the Spirit dwell in us we are spiritual, and
   belong to Christ; otherwise, if not, we are none of his. This the
   apostle farther confirms, verse 11, "If the Spirit of him that raised
   up Jesus from the dead dwell in you." I know not how the person of the
   Holy Ghost can be more clearly deciphered than here he is, "The Spirit
   of him that raised up Jesus from the dead." Why that is mentioned shall
   afterward be considered. And this is the Spirit, as he bears testimony
   of himself, dwells in believers; which is all we say, and, without
   farther curious inquiry, desire to rest therein. Doubtless it were
   better for men to captivate their understandings to the obedience of
   faith than to invent distinctions and evasions to escape the power of
   so many plain texts of Scripture, and those literally and properly, not
   figuratively and metaphorically, expressing the truth contained in
   them; which, though it may be done sometimes, yet is not, in a constant
   uniform tenor of expression, anywhere the manner of the Holy Ghost. The
   apostle also affirms farther, verse 15, that believers "receive the
   Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, Father;" which, being a
   work within them, cannot be wrought and effected by adoption itself,
   which is an extrinsical relation. Neither can adoption and the Spirit
   of adoption be conceived to be the same. He also farther affirms it, 1
   Cor. ii. 12, "We have received the Spirit which is of God, that we
   might know the things that are freely given to us of God;" -- "We have
   so received him as that he abides with us, to teach us, to acquaint our
   hearts with God's dealing with us; bearing witness with our spirits to
   the condition wherein we are in reference to our favour from God and
   acceptation with him." And the same he most distinctly asserts, Gal.
   iv. 6, "God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
   crying, Abba, Father." The distinct economy of the Father, Son, and
   Spirit, in the work of adoption, is here clearly discovered. He is
   sent, "sent of God," that is, the Father. That name is personally to be
   appropriated when it is distinguished, as here, from Son and Spirit.
   That is the Father's work, that work of his love; he scuds him. He hath
   sent him as the "Spirit of his Son," procured by him for us, promised
   by him to us, proceeding from him as to his personal subsistence, and
   sent by him as to his office of adoption and consolation. Then, whither
   the Father hath sent the Spirit of his Son, where he is to abide and
   make his residence, is expressed. It is into "our hearts," saith the
   apostle; there he dwells and abides. And, lastly, what there he doth is
   also manifested. He sets them on work in whom he is, gives them
   privilege for it, ability to it, encouragement in it, causing them to
   cry, "Abba, Father." Once and again to Timothy doth the same apostle
   assert the same truth: 2 Epist. i. 14, "That good thing committed unto
   thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us." The Lord knowing how
   much of our life and consolation depends on this truth, redoubles his
   testimony of it, that we might receive it, -- even we, who are dull and
   slow of heart to believe the things that are written.

   3. Whereas some may say, "It cannot be denied but that the Spirit
   dwells in believers, but yet this is not personally, but only by his
   grace;" I might reply that this indeed, and upon the matter, is not to
   distinguish but to deny what is positively affirmed. To say the Spirit
   dwells in us, but not the person of the Spirit, is not to distinguish
   de modo, but to deny the thing itself. To say, "The graces, indeed, of
   the Spirit are in us" (not "dwell in us," for an accident is not
   properly said to dwell in its subject), "but the Spirit itself doth not
   dwell in us," is expressly to cast down what the word sets up. If such
   distinctions ought to be of force, to evade so many positive and plain
   texts of Scripture as have been produced, it may well be questioned
   whether any truth be capable of proof from Scripture or no. Yet I say
   farther, to obviate such objections, and to prevent all quarrellings
   for the future, the Scripture itself, as to this business of the
   Spirit's indwelling, plainly distinguisheth between the Spirit itself
   and his graces. He is, I say, distinguished from them, and that in
   respect to his indwelling: Rom. v. 5, "The love of God is shed abroad
   in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." The Holy Ghost
   is given to us to dwell in us, as hath been abundantly declared, and
   shall yet farther be demonstrated. Here he is mentioned together with
   the love of God, and his shedding thereof abroad in our hearts, -- that
   is, with his graces; and is as clearly distinguished and differenced
   from them as cause and effect. Take the love of God in either sense
   that is controverted about this place, -- for our love to God or a
   sense of his love to us, -- and it is an eminent grace of the Holy
   Spirit. If, then, by "The Holy Ghost given unto us," ye understand only
   the grace of the Holy Ghost, he being said to be given because that is
   given, then this must be the sense of the place, "The grace of the Holy
   Ghost is shed abroad in our hearts by the grace of the Holy Ghost that
   is given to us." Farther; if by "The Holy Ghost" be meant only his
   grace, I inquire what grace it is [that is] here by the expression
   intended? Is it the same with that expressed, "The love of God?" This
   were to confound the efficient cause with its effect. Is it any other
   grace that doth produce the great work mentioned? Let us know what that
   grace is that hath this power and energy in its band of shedding abroad
   the love of God in our hearts. So Rom. viii. 11, "He shall quicken your
   mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." This quickening of
   our mortal bodies is generally confessed to be (and the scope of the
   place enforceth that sense) our spiritual quickening in our mortal
   bodies, mention being made of our bodies in analogy to the body of
   Christ; by his death we have life and quickening. Doubtless, then, it
   is a grace of the Spirit that is intended; yea, the habitual principle
   of all graces. And this is wrought in us by the Spirit that dwelleth in
   us. There is not any grace of the Spirit whereby he may dwell in men
   antecedent to his quickening of them. Spiritual graces have not their
   residence in dead souls. So that this must be the Spirit himself
   dwelling in us that is here intended, and that personally; or the sense
   of the words must be, "The grace of quickening our mortal bodies is
   wrought in us by the grace of quickening our mortal bodies that
   dwelleth in us;" which is plainly to confound the cause and effect.
   Besides, it is the same Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead that
   is intended; which, doubtless, was not any inherent grace, but the
   Spirit of God himself, working by the exceeding greatness of his power.
   Thus much is hence cleared: Antecedent in order of nature to our
   quickening, there is a Spirit given to us to dwell in us. Every
   efficient cause hath at least the precedency of its effect. No graces
   of the Spirit are bestowed on us before our quickening; which is the
   preparation and fitting of the subject for the receiving of them, the
   planting of the root that contains them virtually, and brings them
   forth actually in their order. Gal. v. 22, 23, all graces whatsoever
   come under the name of the "fruit of the Spirit;" that is, which the
   Spirit, in us brings forth, as the root doth the fruit, which in its so
   doing is distinct therefrom. Many other instances might be given; but
   these may suffice.

   4. There is a personality ascribed to the Holy Ghost in his dwelling in
   us, and that in such a way as cannot be ascribed to any created grace,
   which is but a quality in a subject; and this the Scripture doth three
   ways:-- (1.) In personal appellations; (2.) In personal operations; and
   (3.) In personal circumstances.

   (1.) There are ascribed to the indwelling Spirit, in his indwelling,
   personal appellations, 1 John iv. 4, "He that is in you is greater than
   he that is in the world," -- meizon estin ho en humin. "He that is in
   you" is a personal denomination, which cannot be used of any grace or
   gracious habit whatsoever. So John xiv. 16, 17, "He shall abide with
   you, he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you," -- Humeis ginoskete
   auto (to Pneuma tes aletheias) kai en humin hestai. John xvi. 13, "But
   when the Spirit of truth is come," -- Hotan de elthe ekeinos, to
   Pneuma. His person is here as signally designed and expressed as in any
   place of Scripture, to what intent or purpose soever mentioned. Neither
   is it possible to apprehend that the Scripture would so often, so
   expressly, affirm the same thing in plain, proper words, if they were
   not to be taken in the sense which they hold out. The main emphasis of
   the expression lies upon the terms that are of a personal designation,
   and to evade the force of them by the forementioned distinction, which
   they seem signally to obviate and prevent, is to say what we please, so
   we may oppose what pleases us not.

   (2.) Personal operations, such acts and actings as are proper to a
   person only, are ascribed to the Spirit in his indwelling. That place
   mentioned before, Rom. viii. 11, is clear hereunto, "But if the Spirit
   of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised
   up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his
   Spirit that dwelleth in you," or "by his indwelling Spirit," dia tou
   enoikountos autou Pneumatos en humin. "To quicken our moral bodies" is
   a personal acting, and such as cannot be wrought but by an almighty
   agent; and this is ascribed to the Spirit as inhabiting, which is in
   order of nature antecedent to his quickening of us, as was manifested.
   And the same is asserted, verse 16, "The Spirit itself beareth witness
   with our spirit, that we are the children of God." That Spirit that
   dwells in us, hears witness in us, a distinct witness by himself
   distinguished from the testimony of our own spirits here mentioned, is
   either an act of our natural spirits, or gracious fruit of the Spirit
   of God in our hearts If the flint, what makes it in the things of God?
   Is any testimony of our natural spirits of any value to assure us that
   we are the children of God? If the latter, then is there here an
   immediate operation of the Spirit dwelling in our hearts, in
   witness-bearing, distinct from all the fruits of grace whatever. And on
   this account it is, that whereas, 1 John v. 7, 8, the Father, Son, and
   Spirit are said to bear witness in heaven, the Spirit is moreover
   peculiarly said to bear witness in the earth, together with the blood
   and water.

   (3.) There are such circumstances ascribed to him in his indwelling as
   are proper only to that which is a person. I will instance only in one,
   -- his dwelling in the saints as in a temple: 1 Cor. iii. 16, "Ye are
   the temple of God, the Spirit of God dwelleth in you;" that is, as in a
   temple. So plainly, chap. vi. 19, "Your body is the temple of the Holy
   Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God:" giving us both the
   distinction of the person of the Spirit from the other persons, "he is
   given us of God;" and his residence with us, being so given, "he is in
   us;" as also the manner of his in-being, "as in a temple." Nothing can
   make a place a temple but the relation it hath unto a deity. Graces,
   that are but qualifications of and qualities in a subject, cannot be
   said to dwell in a temple. This the Spirit doth, and therefore as a
   voluntary agent in a habitation, not as a necessary or natural
   principle in a subject. And though every act of his be omnipotent
   intensively, being the act of an omnipotent agent, yet he worketh not
   in the acts extensively to the utmost of his omnipotency, lie exerteth
   and puts forth his power, and brings forth his grace, in the hearts of
   them with whom he dwells, as he pleaseth. To one he communicates more
   grace, to another less; yea, he gives more strength to one and the same
   person at one time and in one condition than at another, dividing to
   every one as he will, 1 Cor. xii. 11. And if this peculiar manner of
   his personal presence with his saints, distinct from his ubiquity or
   omnipresence, may not be believed, because not well by reason
   conceived, we shall lay a foundation for the questioning principles of
   faith which as yet we are not fallen out withal.

   And this is our first manifestation of the truth concerning the
   indwelling of the Spirit in the saints, from the Scripture. The second
   will be from the signal issues and benefits which are asserted to arise
   from this indwelling of the Spirit in them; of which I shall give
   sundry instances.

   II. 1. The first signal issue and effect which is ascribed to this
   indwelling of the Spirit is union; not a personal union with himself,
   which is impossible. He doth not assume our nature, and so prevent our
   personality, which would make us one person with him, but dwells in our
   persons, keeping his own and leaving us our personality infinitely
   distinct. But it is a spiritual union, -- the great union mentioned so
   often in the gospel, that is the sole fountain of our blessedness, --
   our union with the Lord Christ, which we have thereby.

   Many thoughts of heart there have been about this union, -- what it is,
   wherein it doth consist, the causes, manner, and effects of it. The
   Scripture expresses it to be very eminent, near, durable, setting it
   out, for the most part, by similitudes and metaphorical illustrations,
   to lead poor weak creatures into some useful, needful acquaintance with
   that mystery, whose depths in this life they shall never fathom. That
   many in the days wherein we live have miscarried in their conceptions
   of it is evident. Some, to make out their imaginary union, have
   destroyed the person of Christ, and, fancying a way of uniting man to
   God by him, have left him to be neither God nor man. Others have
   destroyed the person of believers, affirming that in their union with
   Christ they lose their own personality, -- that is, cease to be men, or
   at least these or those individual men.

   I intend not now to handle it at large, but only (and that, I hope,
   without offence) to give in my thoughts concerning it, as far as it
   receiveth light from and relateth unto what hath been before delivered
   concerning the indwelling of the Spirit, and that without the least
   contending about other ways of expression.

   I say, then, this is that which gives us union with Christ, and that
   wherein it consists, even that the one and self-same Spirit dwells in
   him and us. The first saving illapse from God upon the hearts of the
   elect is the Holy Spirit. Their quickening is everywhere ascribed to
   the Spirit that is given unto them; there is not a quickening, a
   life-giving power, in a quality, a created thing. In the state of
   nature, besides gracious dispensations and habits in the soul inclining
   it to that which is good, and making it a suitable subject for
   spiritual operations, we want also a vital principle, which should
   actuate the disposed subject unto answerable operations. [198] This a
   quality cannot give. He that carries on the work of quickening doth
   also begin it, Rom. viii. 11. All graces whatever, as was said, are the
   "fruits of the Spirit," Gal. v. 22, 23; and therefore, in order of
   nature, are wrought in men consequentially to his being bestowed on
   them. Now, in the first bestowing of the Spirit we have union with
   Christ; the carrying on whereof consists in the farther manifestation
   and operations of the indwelling Spirit, which is called communion. To
   make this evident, that our union with Christ consists in this, the
   same Spirit dwelling in him and us, and that this is our union, let us
   take a view of it, first, from Scriptural declarations of it, and then,
   secondly, from Scripture illustrations of it, both briefly, being not
   my direct business in hand:--

   First, (1.) Peter tells us that it is a participation of the divine
   nature, 2 Pet. i. 4. We are "by the promises made partakers of the
   divine nature;" that is, it is promised to be given unto us, which when
   we receive, we are made partakers of by the promises. That this
   participation of the divine nature (let it be interpreted how it will)
   is the same upon the matter with our union with Christ, is not
   questioned. That phusis theia should be only a gracious habit, quality,
   or disposition of soul in us, I cannot easily receive. That is
   somewhere called kaine ktisis, the "new creature," [199] but nowhere
   theia phusis, the "divine nature." The pretended high and spiritual,
   but indeed gross and carnal, conceits of some from hence, destructive
   to the nature of God and man, I shall not turn aside to consider. What
   that is of the divine nature, or wherein it doth consist, that we are
   made partakers of by the promises, I showed before. That the person of
   the holy and blessed Spirit is promised to us, -- whence he is called
   the "Holy Spirit of promise," Eph. i. 13, -- hath been, I say, by
   sundry evidences manifested. Upon the accomplishment of that promise,
   he coming to dwell in us, we are said in him, by the promises, to be
   made "partakers of the divine nature." We are theias koinonoi phuseos,
   we have our communion with it. Our participation, then, of the divine
   nature being our union with Christ, consists in the dwelling of [the]
   same Spirit in him and in us, we receiving him by the promise for that
   end.

   (2.) Christ tells us that this union arises from the eating of his
   flesh, and drinking of his blood: John vi. 56, "He that eateth my
   flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him." The mutual
   indwelling of Christ and his saints is their union. "This," saith
   Christ, "is from their eating my flesh, and drinking my blood.'?" But
   how may this be done? Many were offended when this saying was spoken.
   Near and close trials of sincerity drive hypocrites into apostasy. From
   his, Christ takes away this scruple: Verse 63, "It is," saith he, "the
   Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing." It is by the
   indwelling of the quickening Spirit, whereby we have a real
   participation of Christ, whereby he dwelleth in us and we in him. So,
   --

   (3.) He prays for his disciples, John xvii. 21, "that they all may be
   one, as the Father is in him, and he in the Father, that they may be
   one in the Father and Son;" and verse 22, "Let them be one, even as we,
   are one." And that ye may not think that it is only union with and
   among themselves that he presses for (though, indeed, that which gives
   them union with Christ gives them union one with another also, and that
   which constitutes them of the body unites them to the Head, and there
   is one body because there is one Spirit, Eph. iv. 4; which even Lombard
   himself had some notion of, in his assertion that charity, which is in
   us, is the person of the Holy Ghost, from that place of the apostle,
   "God is love"), I say he farther manifests that it is union with
   himself which he intends: John xvii. 23, "I in them," saith he, "and
   thou in me." This union, then, with him, our Saviour declares by, or at
   least illustrates by, resemblance unto his union with the Father.
   Whether this be understood of the union of the divine persons of Father
   and Son in the blessed Trinity (the union, I mean, that they have with
   themselves in their distinct personality, and not their unity of
   essence), or the union which was between Father and Son as incarnate,
   it comes all to one as to the declaration of that union we have with
   him. The Spirit is Vinculum Trinitatis, "The bond of the Trinity," as
   is commonly, and not inaptly spoken. Proceeding from both the other
   persons, being the love and power of them both, he gives that union to
   the trinity of persons, whose substratum and ground is the inestimable
   unity of essence wherein they are one. Or if you take it for the union
   of the Father with the Son incarnate, it is evident and beyond inquiry
   or dispute, that as the personal union of the Divine Word and the human
   nature was by the assumption of that nature into one personal substance
   with itself; so the person of the Father hath no other union with the
   human nature of Christ, immediately and not by the union of his own
   nature thereunto in the person of his Son, but what consists in that
   indwelling of his Spirit in all fullness in the man Christ Jesus. Now,
   saith our Saviour, "This union I desire they may have with me, by the
   dwelling of the same Spirit in me and them, whereby I am in them, and
   they in me, as I am one with thee, O Father."

   Secondly, The Scripture sets forth this union by many illustrations,
   given unto it from the things of the nearest union that are subject to
   our apprehension, giving the very terms of the things so united unto
   Christ and his in their union. I shall name some few of them:--

   (1.) That of head and members making up one body is often insisted on.
   Christ is the head of his saints, and they, being many, are members of
   that one body, and of one another; as the apostle at large, 1 Cor. xii.
   12, "As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of
   that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ." The body
   is one, and the saints are one body, yea, one Christ, -- that is,
   mystical. They, then, are the body. What part is Christ? He is the
   head: 1 Cor. xi. 3, "The head of every man" (that is, every believer)
   "is Christ;" he is "the head of the church, and the saviour of the
   body," Eph. v. 23; he is "the head of the body, the church," Col. i.
   18. This relation of head and members, I say, between Christ and his,
   holds out the union that is between them, which consists in their being
   so. As the head and the members make one body, so Christ and his
   members make one mystical Christ. Whence, then, is it that the head and
   members have this their union, whereby they become one body? wherein
   doth it consist? Is it that from the head the members do receive their
   influences of life, sense, and guidance, as the saints do from Christ?
   Eph. iv. 15, 16, they "grow up into him in all things, which is the
   Head: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
   that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in
   the measure of every part," groweth up to a holy increase. So also Col.
   ii. 19, "Holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands
   having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the
   increase of God." But evidently this is their communion, whereunto
   union is supposed. Our union with Christ cannot consist in the
   communication of any thing to us as members, from him the head; but it
   must be in that which constitutes him and us in the relation of head
   and members. He is our head antecedently in order of nature to any
   communication of grace from him as a head, and yet not antecedently to
   our union with him. Herein, then, consists the union of head and
   members, that though they are many, and have many offices, places, and
   dependencies, there is but one living, quickening soul in head and
   members. If a man could be imagined so big and tall as that his feet
   should stand upon the earth, and his head reach the starry heavens,
   yet, having but one soul, he is still but one man. As, then, one living
   soul makes the natural head and members to be one, one body; so one
   quickening Spirit, dwelling in Christ and his members, gives them their
   union, and makes them one Christ, one body. This is clear from 1 Cor.
   xii. 12, 13. As "the first man Adam was made a living soul," so "the
   last Adam is made a quickening spirit," chap. xv. 45.

   (2.) Of husband and wife. The union that is between them sets out the
   union betwixt Christ and his saints. There is not any one more frequent
   illustration of it in the Scripture, the Holy Ghost pursuing the
   allusion in all the most considerable concernments of it, and holding
   it out as the most solemn representation of the union that is between
   Christ and his church: Eph. v. 31, 32, "For this cause shall a man
   leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and
   they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak
   concerning Christ and the church." The transition is eminent from the
   conjugal relation that is between man and wife unto Christ and his
   church. What the apostle had spoken of the one, he would have
   understood of the other. Wherein consists, then, the union between man
   and wife, which is chosen by God himself to represent the union between
   Christ and his church? The Holy Ghost informs us, Gen. ii. 24, "They
   shall be no more twain, but one flesh." This is their union, -- they
   shall be no more twain, but (in all mutual care, respect, tenderness,
   and love) one flesh. The rise of this you have, verse 23, because of
   the bone and flesh of Adam was Eve his helper made. Hence are they said
   to be "one flesh." Wherein, then, in answer to this, is the union
   between Christ and his church? The same apostle tells us, 1 Cor. vi.
   16, 17, "He," saith he, "that is joined to an harlot is one body, but
   he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit." As they are one flesh,
   so these are one spirit; and as they are one flesh, because the one was
   made out of the other, so these are one spirit, because the Spirit
   which is in Christ, by dwelling in them, makes them his members, which
   is their union.

   (3.) Of a tree, -- an olive, a vine, and its boughs, and branches. "I
   am the vine," saith Christ, "ye are the branches," John xv. 5; "abide
   in me, and I in you." As tree and branches, they have an abiding union
   one with another. Wherein this consists the apostle sets out under the
   example of an olive and his boughs, Rom. xi. 16, 17. It is in this,
   that the branches and boughs being ingrafted into the tree, they
   partake of the very same juice and fatness with the root and tree,
   being nourished thereby. There is the same fructifying, fattening
   virtue in the one as the other; only with this difference, in the root
   and tree it is originally, in the boughs by communication. And this
   also is chosen to set out the union of Christ and his. Both he and they
   are partakers of the same fruit-bearing Spirit; he that dwells in them
   dwells in him also: only, it is in him, as to them, originally; in them
   by communication from him. Take a scion, a graft, a plant, fix it to
   the tree with all the art you can, and bind it on as close as possible,
   yet it is not united to the tree until the sap that is in the tree be
   communicated to it; which communication states the union. Let a man be
   bound to Christ by all the bonds of profession imaginable, yet unless
   the sap that is in him, the holy and blessed Spirit, be also
   communicated to him, there is no union between them. And this is the
   first thing that doth issue and depend upon the indwelling of the
   Spirit in believers, even union with Christ, which is a demonstration
   of it a posteriori.

   2. The Spirit as indwelling gives us life and quickening. "God quickens
   our mortal bodies (or us in them) by his Spirit that dwelleth in us,"
   Rom. viii. 11, by which Spirit Christ also was raised from the dead;
   and therefore, the apostle mentioning in another place the beginning
   and carrying on of faith in us, he saith it is wrought "according to
   the exceeding greatness of the power of God, which he wrought in
   Christ, when he raised him from the dead," Eph. i. 19, 20. Now, in this
   quickening there are two things:-- (1.) The actus primus, or the life
   itself bestowed; (2.) The operations of that life in them on whom it is
   bestowed.

   (1.) For the first, I shall not positively determine what it is, nor
   wherein it doth consist. This is clear, that by nature "we are dead in
   trespasses and sins;" that in our quickening we have a new spiritual
   life communicated to us, and that from Christ, in whom it is treasured
   up for that purpose. But what this life is, it doth not fully appear
   whilst we are here below. All actual graces confessedly flow from it,
   and are distinct from it, as the operations of it. I say, in this sense
   they flow from it confessedly, as suitable actings are from habits,
   though to the actual exercise of any grace within, new help and
   assistance is necessary, in that continual dependence are we upon the
   fountain. Whether it consists in that which is called "habitual grace,"
   or the gracious suitableness and disposition of the soul unto spiritual
   operations, may be doubted. The apostle tells us Christ is our life:
   Col. iii. 4, "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear;" and Gal. ii.
   20, "Christ liveth in me." Christ liveth in believers by his Spirit, as
   hath been declared. "Christ dwelleth in you," and, "His Spirit dwelleth
   in you," are expressions of the same import and signification. But, --

   (2.) God by his Spirit "worketh in us both to will and to do of his own
   good pleasure." All vital actions are from him. It may be said of
   graces and gracious operations as well as gifts, "All these worketh in
   us that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every one as he
   will." But this is not now to be insisted on.

   3. The Spirit as indwelling gives guidance and direction to them in
   whom he is as to the way wherein they ought to walk: Rom. viii. 14, "As
   many as are led by the Spirit of God." The Spirit leads them in whom it
   is. And verse 1, they are said to "walk after the Spirit." Now, there
   is a twofold leading, guidance, or direction:-- (1.) Moral and
   extrinsical, the leading of a rule; (2.) Eternal and efficient, the
   leading of a principle.

   Of these, the one lays forth the way, the other directs and carries
   along in it. The first is the Word, giving us the direction of a way,
   of a rule; the latter is the Spirit, effectually guiding and leading us
   in all the paths thereof. Without this the other's direction will be of
   no saving use; it may be "line upon line, precept upon precept," yet
   men go backward and are ensnared. David, notwithstanding the rule of
   the Word, yea the Spirit of prophecy, for the inditing of more of the
   mind of God for the use of the church, when moved thereunto, yet in one
   psalm cries out four times, "Oh! give me understanding, that I may
   learn try commandments," concluding that hence would be his life, that
   therein it lay: "Oh! give me," saith he, "understanding, and I shall
   live," Ps. cxix. 144. So Paul bidding Timothy consider the word of the
   Scripture, that he might know whence it is that this will be of use
   unto him, he adds, "The Lord give thee understanding in all things," 2
   Tim. ii. 7. How this understanding is given the same apostle informs
   us, Eph. i. 17, 18, "The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
   glory, give unto you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
   knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being" thereby
   "enlightened;" 1 Cor. ii. 11, 12. It is the "Spirit of wisdom and
   revelation," the Holy Spirit of God, from whom is all spiritual wisdom,
   and all revelation of the will of God, who being given unto us by the
   God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our God in him, "enlightens our
   understanding, that we may know," etc. And on this account is the Son
   of God said to "come and give us an understanding to know him that is
   true," that is, himself by his Spirit, 1 John v. 20.

   Now, there be two ways whereby the Spirit gives us guidance to walk
   according to the rule of the word:--

   (1.) By giving us "the knowledge of the will of God, in all wisdom and
   spiritual understanding," Col. i. 9, carrying us on "unto all riches of
   the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the
   mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ," chap. ii. 2. This is
   that spiritual, habitual, saving illumination, which he gives to the
   souls of them to whom he is given: "He who commanded light to shine out
   of darkness, by him shineth into their hearts, to give them the light
   of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jesus Christ," 2 Cor. iv.
   6. This is elsewhere termed "translating from darkness to light,
   opening blind eyes, giving light to them that are in darkness, freeing
   us from the condition of natural men, who discern not the things that
   are of God." [200] This the apostle makes it his design to clear up and
   manifest, Corinthians 2. He tells you the things of the gospel are "the
   wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained
   before the world unto our glow," verse 7; and then proves that an
   acquaintance herewith is not to be attained by any natural means or
   abilities whatsoever, verse 9, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
   neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
   prepared for them that love him;" and thence, unto the end of the
   chapter, variously manifests how this is given to believers and wrought
   in them by the Spirit alone, from whom it is that they know the mind of
   Christ. "But," saith he, "God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit:
   for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God. For
   who knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of a man? and who
   knoweth the things of God but the Spirit of God? And we have received
   the spirit, not of this world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we
   may know the things which are freely given us of God."

   The word is as the way whereby we go; yea, as an external light, as "a
   lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our path," Ps. cxix. 105; yea, as
   the sun in the firmament, sending forth its beams of light abundantly.
   But what will this profit if a man have no eyes in his head? There must
   not only be light in the object and in the medium, but in the subject,
   in our hearts and minds; and this is of the operation of the Spirit of
   light and truth given to us, as the apostle tells us, 2 Cor. iii. 18,
   "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
   are changed into the same image from glory to glow, as by the Spirit of
   the Lord."

   This is the first way whereby the Holy Spirit dwelling in us gives
   guidance and direction. Fundamentally, habitually, he enlightens our
   minds, give us eyes, understandings, shines into us, translates us from
   darkness into marvellous light, whereby alone we are able to see our
   way, to know our paths, and to discern the things of God: without this
   men are "blind, and cannot see afar off," 2 Pet. i. 9.

   There are three things which men either have or may be made partakers
   of without this, -- this communication of light by the indwelling
   Spirit:--

   [1.] They have the subject of knowledge, a natural faculty of
   understanding. Their minds remain; though depraved, destroyed,
   perverted, yea, so far that "their eye and the light that is in them is
   darkness," yet the faculty remains still, Matt. vi. 23.

   [2.] They may have the object, or truth revealed in the word. This is
   common to all that are made partakers of the good word of God; that is,
   to whom it is preached and delivered, as it is to many whom "it doth
   not profit, not being mixed with faith," Heb. iv. 2.

   [3.] The ways and means of communicating the truth so revealed to their
   minds or understandings, which is the literal, grammatical, logical
   delivery of the things contained in the Scriptures, as held out to
   their minds and apprehensions in their meditation on them. And this
   means of conveyance of the sense of the Scripture is plain, obvious,
   and clear, in all necessary truths.

   A concurrence of these three will afford and yield them that have it,
   upon their diligence and inquiry, a disciplinary knowledge of the
   literal sense of Scripture, as they have of other things. By this means
   the light shines phainei, sends out some beams of light into their dark
   minds; "but the darkness comprehends it not," receives not the light in
   a spiritual manner, John i. 5. There is, notwithstanding all this,
   still wanting the work of the Spirit, before mentioned, creating and
   implanting in and upon their understandings and minds that light and
   power of discerning spiritual things which before we insisted on. This
   the Scripture sometimes calls the "opening of the understanding," Luke
   xxiv. 45; sometimes the "giving an understanding" itself, 2 Tim. ii. 7,
   1 John v. 20; sometimes "light in the Lord," Eph. v. 8. Notwithstanding
   all the advantages formerly spoken of, without this men are still
   "natural men and darkness, not comprehending, not receiving the things
   of God," -- that is, not spiritually; for so the apostle adds, "Because
   they are spiritually discerned," 1 Cor. ii. 14. Receiving spiritual
   things by mere natural mediums, they become "foolishness" unto them.
   This is the first thing that the Spirit dwelling in us doth towards
   guidance and direction: he gives a new light and understanding,
   whereby, in general, we are enabled to "discern, comprehend, and
   receive spiritual things."

   (2.) In particular, he guides and leads men to the embracing particular
   truths, and to the walking in and up unto them. Christ promised to give
   him to us for this end, -- namely, to lead us into all truth: John xvi.
   13, "He will guide you into all truth." There is more required to the
   receiving, entertaining, embracing, a particular truth, and rejecting
   of what is contrary unto it, than a habitual illumination. This also is
   the work of the Spirit that dwells in us; he works this also in our
   minds and hearts. Therefore the apostle secures his "little children"
   that they shall be led into truth and preserved from seduction on this
   account: 1 John ii. 20, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One" (or, ye
   have received the Spirit from the Lord Jesus), "and ye shall know all
   things." Why so? Because it is his work to guide and lead you into all
   the things whereof I am speaking. And more fully, verse 27, "The
   anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not
   that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all
   things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye
   shall abide in him." It is received as promised; it doth abide, as the
   Spirit is said to do; and it teacheth, which is the proper work of the
   Spirit in an eminent manner.

   Now, this guidance of believers by the Spirit, as to the particular
   truths and actings, consists in his putting forth of a twofold act of
   light and power:--

   [1.] Of light; and that also is twofold:--

   1st. Of beauty, as to the things to be received or done. He represents
   them to the soul as excellent, comely, desirable, and glorious, leading
   us on in the receiving of truth "from glory to glory," 2 Cor. iii. 18.
   He puts upon every truth a new glory, making and rendering it desirable
   to the soul; without which it cannot be closed withal, as not
   discovering either suitableness or proportion unto the minds and hearts
   of men. And, --

   2dly. By some actual elevation of the mind and understanding to go
   forth unto and receive into itself the truth as represented to it: by
   both of them sending forth light and truth, Ps. xliii. 3; blowing off
   the clouds, and raising up the day-star that rises in our hearts, 2
   Pet. ii. 19.

   [2.] Of power: Isa. xxxv. 5, 6, the breaking forth of streams makes not
   only the blind to see but the lame to leap. Strength comes as well as
   light, by the pouring out of the Spirit on us; strength for the
   receiving and practice of all his gracious discoveries to us.

   He leads us, not only in general, implanting a saving light in the
   mind, whereby it is disposed and enabled to discern spiritual things in
   a spiritual manner, but also as to particular truths, rendering them
   glorious and desirable. Opening the mind and understanding by new beams
   of light, he leads the soul irresistibly unto the receiving of the
   truths revealed; which is the second thing we have by him.

   I shall only observe, for a close of this, one or two consequences of
   the weight of this twofold operation of the indwelling of Christ:--

   [1.] From the want of the first, or his creating a new light in the
   minds of men, it is that so many labour in the fire for an acquaintance
   with the things of God; it is, I say, a consequence of it, as darkness
   is of absence of the sun. Many we see, after sundry years spent in
   considerable labours and diligence, reading of many books, with a
   contribution of assistance from other useful arts and sciences, in the
   issue of all their endeavours do wax "vain in their imaginations,
   having their foolish hearts darkened; professing themselves wise, they
   become fools;" being so far from any sap and savour that they have not
   the leaves of ability in things divine, Rom. i. 21, 22. Others, indeed,
   make some progress in a disciplinary knowledge of the doctrines of the
   Scriptures, and can accurately reason and distinguish about them,
   according to the forms wherein they have been exercised, and that to a
   great height of conviction in their own spirits, and permanency in the
   profession they have taken up. But yet all this while they abide
   without any effectual power of the truth conforming and framing their
   spirits unto the likeness and mould thereof, Rom. vi. 17. They do but
   "see men walking like trees." Some shines of the light break in upon
   them, which rather amaze than guide them; they "comprehend it not."
   They see spiritual things in a natural light, and presently forget what
   manner of things they were, and in the species wherein they are
   retained they are "foolishness,' 1 Cor. ii. 12-14.

   [2.] From the want of the latter it is that we ourselves are so slow in
   receiving some parts of truth, and do find it so difficult to convince
   others of some other parts of it, which to us are written with the
   beams of the sun. Unless the truth itself be rendered a glory to the
   understanding, and the mind be actually enlightened as to the truth
   represented, it is not to be received in a spiritual manner. Those who
   know at all what the truth is, "as the truth is in Jesus," will not
   take it up upon any other more common account. Sometimes in dealing
   with godly persons to convince them of a truth, we are ready to admire
   at their stupidity or perverseness, that they will not receive that
   which shines in with so broad a light upon our spirits. The truth is,
   until the Holy Spirit sends forth the light and power mentioned, it is
   impossible that their minds and hearts should rest and acquiesce in any
   truth whatever. But, --

   4. From this indwelling of the Spirit we have supportment. Our hearts
   are very ready to sink and fail under our trials; indeed, a little
   thing will cause us so to do: flesh, and heart, and all that is within
   us, are soon ready to fail, Ps. lxxiii. 26. Whence is it that we do not
   sink into the deeps? that we have so many and so sweet and gracious
   recoveries, when we are ready to be swallowed up? The Spirit that
   dwells in us gives us supportment. Thus it was with David, Ps. li. 12.
   He was ready to be overwhelmed under a sense of the guilt of that great
   sin which God then sorely charged upon his conscience, and cries out
   like a man ready to sink under water, "O uphold me with thy free
   Spirit;" -- "If that do not support me, I shall perish." So Rom. viii.
   26, the Spirit helpeth, bears up that infirmity which is ready to make
   us go double. How often should we be overborne with our burdens, did
   not the Spirit put under his power to bear them and to support us! Thus
   Paul assures himself that he shall be carried through all his trials by
   the help supplied to him by the Spirit, Phil. i. 19.

   There are two special ways whereby the Spirit communicates supportment
   unto the saints when they are ready to sink, and that upon two
   accounts, first, of consolation, and then of strength:--

   (1.) The first he doth by brining to mind the things that Jesus Christ
   hath left in store for their supportment. Our Saviour Christ informing
   his disciples how they should be upheld in their tribulations, tells
   them that the Comforter, which should dwell with them and be in them,
   John xiv. 16, 17, should bring to remembrance what he had told them,
   verse 26. Christ had said many things, things gracious and heavenly, to
   his disciples; he had given them many rich and precious promises to
   uphold their hearts in their greatest perplexities; -- but knowing full
   well how ready they were to forget and to let slip the things that were
   spoken, [201] and how coldly his promises would come in to their
   assistance, when retained only in their natural faculties, and made use
   of by their own strength, to obviate these evils, he tells them that
   this work he committeth to the charge of another, who will do it to the
   purpose. "When ye are ready to drive away, the Comforter," saith he,
   "who is in you, he shall bring to remembrance and apply to your souls
   the things that I have spoken, the promises that I have made; which
   will then be unto you as life from the dead." And this he doth every
   day. How often, when the spirits of the saints are ready to faint
   within them, when straits and perplexities are round about them, that
   they know not what to do, nor whither to apply themselves for help or
   supportment, doth the Spirit that dwelleth in them bring to mind some
   seasonable, suitable promise of Christ, that bears them up quite above
   their difficulties and distractions, opening such a new spring of life
   and consolation to their souls as that they who but now stooped, yea
   were almost bowed to the ground, do stand upright, and feel no weight
   or burden at all! Oftentimes they go for water to the well, and are not
   able to draw; or, if it be poured out upon them, it comes like rain on
   a stick that is fully dry. They seek to promises for refreshment, and
   find no more savour in them than in the white of an egg; but when the
   same promises are brought to remembrance by the Spirit the Comforter,
   who is with them and in them, how full of life and power are they!

   (2.) As this he doth to support believers in respect of consolation, so
   as to the communication of real strength, he stirs up those graces in
   them that are strengthening and supporting. The graces of the Spirit
   are indeed, all of them, supporting and upholding. If the saints fall
   and sink at any time, in any duty, under any trial, it is because their
   graces are decayed, and do draw back as to the exercise of them. "If
   thou faint in the day of adversity," it is not because thy adversaries
   are great or strong, but because "thy strength is small," Prov. xxiv.
   10. All our fainting is from the weakness of our strength; faith,
   waiting, patience, are small. When David's faith and patience began to
   sink and draw back, he cried, "?All men are liars;' I shall perish one
   day by the hand of mine enemies," Ps. cxvi. 11, 1 Sam. xxvii. 1. When
   faith is but little, and grace but weak, we shall be forced, if the
   wind do but begin to blow, to cry out, "Save, Lord, or we sink and
   perish." Let a temptation, a lust, a corruption, lay any grace asleep,
   and the strongest saint will quickly become like Samson with his hair
   cut and the Philistines about him: he may think to do great matters,
   but at the first trial he is made a scorn to his enemies. Peter thought
   it was the greatness of the wind and waves that terrified him; but our
   Saviour tells him it was the weakness of his faith that betrayed him,
   Matt. xiv. 30, 31. For relief in this condition, the Spirit that dwells
   in the saints stirs up, enlivens, and actuates, all his graces in them,
   that may support and strengthen them in their duties and under their
   tribulations. Rom. v., Paul runs up the influence of grace into the
   saints' supportment unto this fountain: Verse 3, "We glory in
   tribulations." This is as high a pitch as can be attained. To be
   patient under tribulation is no small victory; to glory in it a most
   eminent triumph, a conformity to Christ, who in his cross triumphed
   over all his opposers. "We are not only patient under tribulations, and
   have strength to bear them, but," saith the apostle, "we glory and
   rejoice in them, as things very welcome to us." How comes this about?
   Saith he, "Tribulation worketh patience" (that is, it sets it at work,
   for tribulation in itself will never work or beget patience in us);
   "and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not
   ashamed." It is from hence that these graces, patience, experience,
   hope, being set on work, do bear up and support our souls, and raise
   them to such a height under their pressures that we have great cause of
   rejoicing in them all. Yea, but whence is this? do these graces readily
   come forth and exert themselves with an efficacy suitable to this
   triumphing frame? The ground and spring of all is discovered, verse 5;
   it is, "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
   Holy Ghost which is given unto us." From this fountain do all these
   fresh streams flow. The Spirit that is given us, that "sheds abroad the
   love of God in our hearts," and thereby sets all our graces on work, he
   oils the wheels of the soul's obedience, when we neither know what to
   do nor how to perform what we know.

   5. This indwelling Spirit gives restraint. Restraining grace doth
   mainly consist in moral persuasion, from the causes, circumstances, and
   ends of things. When a man is dissuaded from sin, upon considerations
   taken from any such head or place as is apt to prevail with him, that
   persuasion, so applied and intended of God for that end, is unto him
   restraining grace. By this means doth the Lord keep within bounds the
   most of the sons of men, notwithstanding all their violent and
   impetuous lusts. Hell, shame, bitterness, disappointment, on the one
   hand, credit, repute, quietness of conscience, and the like, on the
   other, bind them to their good behaviour. God through these things
   drops an awe upon their spirits, binding them up from running out unto
   that compass of excess and riot in sinning which otherwise their lusts
   would carry them unto. This is not his way of dealing with the saints;
   he "puts his law in their inward parts, and writes it in their hearts,"
   Jer. xxxi. 33, that they may not depart from him, making them a willing
   people through his own power, Ps. cx. 3. By his effectually restraining
   grace he carries them out kindly, cheerfully, willingly, to do his
   whole will, "working in them both to will and to do of his good
   pleasure." Yet, notwithstanding all this, oftentimes, through the
   strength of temptation, the subtlety of Satan, and his readiness to
   improve all advantages to the utmost, and the treachery and
   deceitfulness of indwelling sin and corruption, they are carried beyond
   the bounds and lines of that principle or law of life and love whereby
   they are led. What now doth the Lord do? They are ready to run quite
   out of the pasture of Christ; doth he then let them go, and give them
   up to themselves? Nay; but he sets a hedge about them, that they shall
   not find their way; he leads them as the "wild ass in her month," that
   they may be found; he, puts a restraint upon their spirits, by setting
   home some sad considerations of the evil of their hearts and ways,
   whither they are going, what they are doing, and what shall be the
   issue of their walking so loosely, even in this life, -- what shame,
   what scandal, what dishonour to themselves, their profession, the
   gospel, their brethren, it would prove; and so hampers them, quiets
   their spirits, and gently brings them again under obedience unto that
   principle of love that is in them, and to the Spirit of grace (whose
   yoke they were casting off) whereby they are led. Many times, then,
   even the saints of God are kept from sins, especially outward, actual
   sins, upon such outward motives, reasonings, and considerations as
   other men are. Peter was broken loose, and running down hill apace,
   denying and forswearing his Master; Christ puts a restraint upon his
   spirit by a look towards him. This minds him of his folly, unkindness,
   his former rash confidence and engagement to die with his Master, and
   sets him on such considerations as stirred up the principle of grace in
   him to take its place and rule again; and, in obedience thereunto, he
   not only desists from any farther denial, but faith, repentance, love,
   all exerting themselves, he "went out, and wept bitterly." It is so
   frequently with the saints of God, though in lesser evils. By neglect
   and omission of duty, or inclination to evil, and closing with
   temptations, they break out of the pure and perfect rule and guidance
   of the Spirit, whereby they ought to be led. Instantly some
   considerations or other are pressed in upon their spirits, taken,
   perhaps, from outward things, which recover them to that obediential
   frame from whence, through violence of corruption and temptation, they
   had broken; like [as] a hawk sitting on a man's hand, eating her meat
   in quietness, is suddenly, by the original wildness of her nature,
   carried out to an attempt of flying away with speed, but is checked by
   the string at her heels, upon which she returns to her meat again. We
   have an innate wildness in us, provoking and stirring us up to run from
   God. Were we not recovered by some clog fastened on us for our
   restraint, we should often run into the most desperate paths. And this
   restraint, I say, is from the indwelling Spirit. He stirs up one thing
   or other to smite the heart and conscience, when it is under the power
   of any temptation to sin and folly. So it was with David in the attempt
   he made upon Saul, when he cut off the lap of his garment. Temptation
   and opportunity had almost turned him loose from under the power of
   faith, waiting, and dependence on God, wherein lay the general frame of
   his spirit; he is recovered to it by a blow upon the heart, from some
   dismal consideration of the issue and scandal of that which he was
   about.

   6. We have hereby also the renewal, daily renewal, of sanctifying
   grace. Inherent grace is a thing in its own nature apt to decay and
   die; it is compared to things ready to die: Rev. iii. 2, "Strengthen
   the things that remain," saith Christ to the church of Sardis, "that
   are ready to die." It is a thing that may wither and decline from its
   vigour, and the soul may thereby be betrayed into manifold weaknesses
   and backslidings. It is not merely from the nature of the trees in the
   garden of God that their fruit fails not nor their leaves wither, but
   from their "planting by the rivers of water," Ps. i. 3. Hence are the
   sicknesses, weaknesses, and decays of the spirit, mentioned in the
   Scripture. Should he who had the richest stock of any living be left to
   spend of it without new supplies, he would quickly be a bankrupt. This
   also is prevented by the indwelling Spirit. He is the fatness of the
   olive, that is communicated to the branches continually, to keep them
   fruitful and flourishing. He is that golden oil which passes through
   the branches and empties itself in the fruitfulness of the church. He
   continually fills our lamps with new oil, and puts new vigour into our
   spirits: Ps. xcii. 10, "My horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an
   unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil," or renewed supplies of
   the Spirit. And this, Ps. ciii. 5, is called a renewing of youth like
   the eagle's, -- a recovery of former strength and vigour, new power and
   ability for new duties and performances. And how comes that about?
   Saith the psalmist, "It is by God's satisfying my mouth with good
   things." He satisfied his mouth with good things, or answered his
   prayers. What these good things are which the saints pray for, and
   wherewith their mouths are satisfied, our Saviour tells us: "Your
   Father," saith he, "knoweth how to give good things to them that ask
   them of him;" which expressing in another place, he saith, "Your Father
   will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him of him." He is given us,
   and he renews our strength as the eagle's, making our souls, which were
   ready to languish, prompt, ready, cheerful, strong in the ways of God.
   To this purpose is that prayer of the spouse, Cant. iv. 16, "Awake, O
   north wind; and come, thou south; and blow upon my garden, that the
   savour of my spices may flow out. Let my Beloved come into his garden,
   that he may eat of the fruit of his precious things." She is sensible
   of the withering of her spices, the decays of her graces, and her
   disability thereupon to give any suitable entertainment unto Jesus
   Christ. Hence is her earnestness for new breathings and operations of
   the Spirit of grace, to renew, and revive, and set on work again, her
   graces in her, which without it could not be done. All graces are the
   fruits of the Spirit: Gal. v. 22, 23, "The fruit of the Spirit is love,
   joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
   temperance." If the root do not communicate fresh juice and sap
   continually, the fruit will quickly wither. Were there not a continual
   communication of new life and freshness unto our graces from the
   indwelling Spirit, we should soon be poor withered branches. This our
   Saviour tells us, John xv. 4, 5, "Abide in me, and I in you. As the
   branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no
   more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches:
   He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
   fruit: for severed, from me ye can do nothing." Our abiding in Christ
   and his in us, is, as was declared, by the indwelling of the same
   Spirit in him and us. Hence, saith Christ, have ye all your
   fruit-bearing virtue. And unless that be continued to us, we shall
   wither and consume to nothing. David, in his spiritually-declined
   condition, entangled under the power and guilt of sin, cries out for
   the continuance of the Spirit and the restoring him, as to those ends
   and purposes in reference whereunto he was departed from him, Ps. li.
   11, 12. This the apostle prays earnestly that the Ephesians may
   receive: Chap. iii. 14, 16, 17, "I bow my knees unto the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, that he would grant you, according to the riches of
   his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner
   man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
   rooted and grounded in love," etc. The inner man is the same with the
   new creature, the new principle of grace in the heart. This is apt to
   be sick, to faint, and decay. The apostle prays that it might be
   strengthened. How is this to be done? how is it to be renewed,
   increased, enlivened? It is, saith he, by the mighty power of the
   Spirit; and he then gives you particular instances in the graces which
   flourish and spring up effectually upon that strengthening they receive
   by the might and power of the Spirit, as of faith, love, knowledge, and
   assurance, the increasing and establishing of all which are ascribed
   there unto him. He who bestows these graces on us and works them in us
   doth also carry them on unto perfection. Were it not for our inflowings
   from that spring, our cisterns would quickly be dry. Therefore our
   Saviour tells us that he, the Spirit, is unto believers as rivers of
   living water flowing out of their bowels, John vii. 38, 39; as a
   never-failing fountain, that continually puts forth living waters of
   grace in us.

   This may a little farther be considered and insisted on, being directly
   to our main purpose in hand. It is true, indeed, it doth more properly
   belong unto that which I have assigned for the second part of this
   treatise, concerning the ground or principle of the saints' abiding
   with God for ever; but falling in conveniently in this order, I shall
   farther press it from John iv. 14: "Whosoever," saith our Saviour,
   "shall drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst: but
   the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
   springing up into everlasting life."

   The occasion of these words is known; they are part of our Saviour's
   colloquy with the poor Samaritan harlot. Having told her that he could
   give her another manner of water, and infinitely better than that which
   she drew out of Jacob's well, (for which the poor creature did almost
   contemn him, and asked him whence he had that water whereof he spake,
   how he came by it, or what he made of himself, -- did he think himself
   a better man than Jacob, who drank of that well which she was drawing
   water out of?) to convince her of the truth and reality of his promise,
   he compares the water that he would and could give with that which she
   drew out of the well, especially as to one eminent effect, wherein the
   water of his promise did infinitely surmount that which she so
   magnified: for, verse 13, he tells her, [as] for that water in the
   well, though it allayed thirst for a season, yet within a little while
   she would thirst again, and must come thither to draw; "But," saith he,
   "whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him shall never
   thirst." And this he proverb from the condition of the water he giveth:
   "It is a well of water; not a draught, not a pitcherful, as that thou
   carriest away, but it is a fountain, a well." "Yea, perhaps in itself
   it is so, a fountain or well, but he that drinks of it, he hath but one
   draught of that water." "Nay," saith Christ, "it shall become a well in
   him; not a well whereunto he may go, but a well that he shall carry
   about in him. He that hath a continual spring of living water in him
   shall doubtless have no occasion of fainting for thirst any more." This
   our Saviour amplifies and clears up unto her, from the nature and
   energy of this well of water, "It springeth up into everlasting life;"
   in these last words instructing the poor sinful creature in the use of
   the parable that he had used with her. Having taken an occasion to
   speak to her of heavenly things from the nature of the employment that
   she was engaged in at present, two or three things may be observed from
   the words, to give light into their tendency to the confirmation of the
   truth we have under consideration:--

   (1.) The water here promised by our Saviour is the holy and blessed
   Spirit; this needs no labour to demonstrate. The Spirit himself so
   interprets it, John vii. 38, 39, "He that believeth on me," saith our
   Saviour, "as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow
   rivers of living water. But this spake he of the Spirit, which they
   that believe on him should receive." That which in one place he calleth
   "a well of water springing up into everlasting life in us," is in the
   other, in equivalent terms, called "rivers of living water flowing out
   of our bellies;" and the Holy Ghost tells us that he himself, the
   blessed Spirit, is signified by that expression. Neither is there any
   thing bestowed on us that can be compared to a spring of water rising
   up, increasing, and flowing out abundantly, upon its own account, but
   the Spirit only. It is only the Spirit that is a fountain of
   refreshment, from whence all grace doth abundantly flow. It is, I say,
   the Spirit whereof we have been speaking, who is procured for us and
   bestowed upon us by Jesus Christ, which, as an everlasting fountain,
   continually supplies us with refreshing streams of grace, and fills us
   anew therewith, when the channels thereof in our souls are ready to
   become dry. And, --

   (2.) The state and condition of them on whom this living water is
   bestowed, in reference thereunto, is described. Saith our Saviour, "He
   that hath this Spirit of grace, this well of living water, shall never
   thirst." It is most emphatically expressed by two negatives, and an
   exegetical additional term for weight and certainty: Ou me dipsese, "He
   shall never thirst to eternity;" or, as it is expressed, John vi. 35,
   "He shall never thirst at any time." There is a twofold thirst:--

   [1.] There is a thirst totalis indigentiæ, of a whole and entire want
   of that men thirst after; and this is the thirst that returns upon men
   in their natural lives. After they have allayed it once with natural
   water, they thirst again; and their want of water returns as entire and
   full as if they had never drank in their lives. Such a spiritual thirst
   doth God ascribe to wicked men, Isa. lxv. 13, "My servants shall eat,
   but ye shall be hungry; my servants shall drink, but ye shall be
   thirsty." Their hunger and thirst is the total want of grace; not that
   they do desire it, but that they have it not. And this thirst of total
   want of grace is that that never shall nor can befall them who have
   received the Spirit of grace as a well of water in them. They can never
   so thirst as to be returned again into the condition wherein they were
   before they drank of that Spirit.

   [2.] There is also a thirst of desire and complacency of the good
   things thirsted after. In this sense they are pronounced blessed who
   "hunger and thirst after righteousness," Matt. v. 6. And Peter
   instructs us to grow in this thirst more and more: 1 Pet. ii. 2, "As
   new-born babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
   thereby." The enjoyment of the Spirit doth not take away this thirst,
   but begin it and increase it; and by this thirst, as one means, are we
   preserved from that total want and indigency, which shall never again
   befall us.

   (3.) Our Saviour gives the reason why and whence it is that they who
   drink of this water, are made partakers of his Spirit, shall thirst no
   more, or never be brought to the condition of total want of grace,
   which they were in before they received him: "Because the water which I
   shall give them," saith he, "the Spirit which I shall bestow upon them,
   dwelleth in them," as we have showed, "shall be a well of water," a
   fountain of grace, "springing up in them to everlasting life,"
   continuing and perpetuating the grace communicated, unto the full
   fruition of God in glory. There are, among others, three eminent things
   in this reason to confirm us in the faith of the former assertion:--

   [1.] The condition or nature of the Spirit in believers. He is a "well,
   a fountain, a spring," that never can nor will be dry to eternity.

   [2.] The constant supplies of grace that this Spirit affords them in
   whom he is; he is water always "springing up." So that to say he will
   refresh saints and believers with his grace, provided that they turn
   not profligately, wicked, is openly to contradict our Saviour Christ,
   with as direct opposition to the design in the words, as can be
   imagined. This springing up of grace, which from him is had and
   received, which is his work in us, is that whereunto this profligate
   wickedness is opposed; and whilst that is, this cannot be. There is an
   everlasting inconsistency between profligate wickedness and a
   never-failing spring of grace.

   [3.] His permanency in this work, and efficacy by it. This living water
   springs up to "everlasting life." He ceases not until our spiritual
   life be consummated in eternity.

   This, then, is the sum of this promise of our Saviour: He gives his
   Holy Spirit to his; who lives in them, and gives them such continual
   supplies of grace, that they shall never come to a total want of it, as
   they do of elementary water who have once drunk thereof. And from this
   spring doth this argument flow: They on whom the Spirit is bestowed to
   abide with them for ever, and to whom he constantly yields such
   supplies of grace as that they shall never be reduced to a total want
   for ever, they shall certainly and infallibly persevere; but that this
   is the condition of all that come to Christ by believing, or that
   Christ hath promised that so it shall be with them, is clear from his
   own testimony now insisted on: ergo.

   Unto this argument from the promise of our Saviour, Mr Goodwin
   endeavours an answer, chap. xi. sect. 10-12, pp. 232, 233, and in the
   preface of it tells us, "That this scripture doth but face (if so much)
   the business in hand." To "face" it, I suppose, is to appear at first
   view in its defence; and this, indeed, cannot well or colourably be
   denied, the words of it punctually expressing the very truth we intend
   to prove thereby; and this, notwithstanding the allaying qualification,
   "If so much," must needs somewhat prejudice the ensuing evasions. But
   we are yet farther confident that upon the more diligent and strict
   examination, it will be found to speak to the very heart and soul of
   the business in hand. And the consideration of his reasons to the
   contrary doth seem only to give us farther light herein and assurance
   hereof. He says, then, --

   "Here is no promise made that they who once believe, how unworthily
   soever they shall behave themselves, shall still be preserved by God,
   or the Spirit of God, in believing, or that they shall be necessitated
   always to believe."

   Ans. This is the old play still. It is not at all our intendment to
   produce any promise of safeguarding men in the love of God, how vile
   soever they may prove, but of preserving them from all such
   unworthiness as should render them utterly incapable thereof. And this
   is plainly here asserted, in the assurance given of the perpetual
   residence of the Spirit in them, with such continual supplies of grace
   from him as shall certainly preserve them from any such state or
   condition as is imagined. Of being necessitated to believe, I have
   spoken formerly. The expression is neither used by us, nor proper to
   the thing itself about which it is used, nor known in the Scripture as
   to this purpose; and therefore we justly reject it as to its signifying
   any thing of the way and manner whereby we are preserved by the power
   of God through faith unto salvation. If it denotes only the certainty
   and infallibility of the event, as the phrase or locution is improper,
   so to deny that there is a promise of our being preserved by the Spirit
   of God in believing is not to answer our argument, but to beg the thing
   in question, yea, to deny the positive assertion of the Lord Christ.
   But if there be not such a promise in the words, what then is in them?
   what do they contain? Saith he, --

   "They are only a declaration and assertion made by Christ of the
   excellency and desirableness of that life which he comes to give unto
   the world, above the life of nature, which is common unto all. This, by
   comparing the words with those in the former verse, is evident.
   Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever
   drinketh of the water that I shall give him,' etc. That is, The best
   means that can be had and enjoyed to render this present life free from
   inconveniencies will not effect it; but whosoever shall drink, enjoy,
   receive, and believe, the doctrine which I shall administer unto him,
   shall hereby be made partaker of such a life, which shall within a
   short time, if men be careful in the interim to preserve it, by reason
   of the nature, and perfect condition, and constitution of it, be exempt
   from all sorrow, trouble, and inconvenience whatsoever, as being
   eternal.'?"

   Ans. [1.] That these words are only an assertion of the excellency and
   desirableness of that eternal life which Christ would give above the
   natural, that the woman sued to sustain, and that this appears from the
   context, is said, indeed, but no more. It is true, our Saviour doth
   divert the thoughts of the woman from the natural life, and care for
   provision about it, with an insinuation of a better life to be
   attained. But is this all he doth? or is this the intendment of the
   words under consideration? Doth not the main of the opposition or
   difference which at present he speaks unto lie in the supplies that are
   given for the two kinds of life whereof he speaks? The water, he tells
   her, which she drew from that well by which he sat, for the supply of
   her natural life, was such that, after her drinking of it, she should
   quickly return to the same condition of thirst as formerly before she
   drank of it; but that which he gave was such as that whoever drank of
   it should thirst no more, but be certainly preserved in and unto the
   full fruition of that life whereof it is the means and supply. The
   opposition is not between the lives continued, but the mean of
   consolation and its efficacy.

   [2.] It is not the condition of the life natural, which is subject to
   dissolution and not capable of perfection, that is the reason why they
   thirst again and again that have water natural for the refreshment
   thereof; but it is the nature of the means itself which is supplied,
   that is not fitted or suited to permanency and abiding usefulness (as
   the water which Christ promises is), that he insists on. There is not
   any thing [which] leads us to suppose that it is the imperfection of
   life, and not the condition of the means of natural life, that is
   primarily intended in the instituted comparison, though the frailty and
   nothingness of that life also be afterward intimated in the
   substitution of eternal life unto the thoughts of the poor woman in the
   room thereof.

   [3.] I say that it is not the doctrine of Christ, but his Spirit
   principally, that he is here said to give as water; and that this is
   not promised to make men partakers of eternal life if in the interim
   they be careful to preserve it, but to preserve them to it, and to give
   them that care which as a grace is needful thereunto. The plain
   intendment of the promise is, that by the water they drink they shall
   be kept and preserved in the life whereof they are made partakers, unto
   the fullness and perfection of it; which preservation, by the
   parenthesis, "If any be careful in the interim to preserve it," is
   directly taken away from the Spirit that Christ promiseth, and assigned
   to men's own care, even in contradistinction to all the benefits which
   they receive by him being so bestowed on them. The difference, then,
   here between Jesus Christ and Mr Goodwin is this:-- Christ saith, "The
   water that he shall give will be a well springing up to everlasting
   life;" Mr Goodwin, "That it is the care of men to preserve themselves
   that produces that effect."

   [4.] The present exemption which we have by the water of Christ's
   giving is not from sorrow and trouble, but from thirst; that is, from
   what is opposed unto and is destructive of that life which he also
   gives, as natural thirst is unto natural life. But of this thirst and
   our exemption from it I have spoken before. It is not, then, the nature
   and condition of the life promised that he points unto, no farther than
   as it is coincident with the means of it here spoken of. Indeed, this
   means of life is our life, as to the inchoation of it here below, and
   its daily growing up unto perfection. But he adds, sect. 11, --

   "That he doth not oppose that life, which accrues unto men by drinking
   theft water which he gives them, unto the natural life, which they live
   by other means in respect of the present condition or constitution of
   it, or as it is enjoyed by men in this present world, is evident from
   hence, because he asserts it free from thirst (Shall never thirst').
   Now, we know that the saints themselves, notwithstanding that life of
   grace which is in them, by drinking that water that Christ hath given
   them, are yet subject to both kinds of thirst, as well that which is
   corporeal or natural as that which is spiritual; yea, the spiritual
   thirst unto which they are now subject, though it argues a deficiency
   of what they would farther have or desire to be, and in that respect is
   troublesome, yet is it argumentative of the goodness of their
   condition, Matt. v. 6."

   Ans. [1.] The sum of this answer is, That the life here spoken of and
   promised is not that spiritual life whereof we are here made partakers,
   but eternal life, which is for to come, which, when any attain, they
   shall never fail in or fall from; but whether they may or shall attain
   it or no, here is nothing spoken. But here is no notice taken of the
   main opposition insisted on by our Saviour, between the supplies of the
   Spirit for life eternal, which fail not, nor suffer them to thirst to
   whom they are given, and the supplies of natural life by elementary
   water, notwithstanding which they who are made partakers thereof do in
   a short season come to a total want of it again. Instead of answers to
   our argument from this place, we meet with nothing but perpetual
   diversions from the whole scope and intendment of it, and at last are
   told that the promise signifies only that men should not want grace
   when they come to heaven!

   [2.] To prove that there is no promise of any abiding spiritual life
   here, these words, "They shall never thirst," are produced. That we
   shall have our life continued to the full enjoyment of it unto
   eternity, because such are the supplies of the Spirit bestowed on us
   that we shall never thirst, is the argument of our Saviour. That there
   is no such life promised or here to be attained, because in it we shall
   not thirst, is Mr Goodwin's.

   [3.] It is not the intendment of our Saviour to prove that we shall not
   thirst because we shall have such a life, but the quite contrary, that
   we shall have such a life, and shall assuredly be preserved, because
   the supplies of the Spirit which he gives will certainly take away the
   thirst, which is so opposite to it as to be destructive of it.

   [4.] It is true, the saints, notwithstanding this promise, are still
   liable to thirst, that thirst intimated Matt. v. 6, "after
   righteousness;" but not at all to that thirst which they have a promise
   here to be freed from, a thirst of a universal want of that water
   wherewith they are refreshed. And that their freedom from this thirst
   is their portion in this life, we have the testimony of Christ himself:
   "He that believeth on me shall never thirst," John vi. 35. And the
   reason of their not thirsting is the receiving and drinking in that
   water which Christ gives them; which, as himself says, is his Spirit,
   which they receive who believe on him, John vii. 38, 39. Neither is
   that thirst of theirs which doth remain troublesome, as is insinuated,
   it being a grace of the Spirit, and so quieting and composing; though
   they are troubled for the want of that in its fullness which they
   thirst after, yet their thirst is no way troublesome. That, then, which
   is farther added by Mr Goodwin is exceeding sophistical.

   Saith he, "By the way, this spiritual thirst, which is incident unto
   the life which is derived from Christ, and the waters given by him unto
   men, as it is enjoyed and possessed by them in this present world, is
   (according to the purport of our Saviour's own arguing) an argument
   that for the present, and whilst it is obnoxious to such a thirst, it
   is dissolvable and may fail; for in the latter part of the said
   passage, he plainly implies that the eternalness of that life which
   springs from the drinking of this water is the reason or cause why it
   is exempt from thirst. Let the whole passage be read and minded, and
   this will clearly appear. If, then, the eternality of a life be the
   cause or reason why it is free from the inconveniency of thirst,
   evident it is that such a life which is not free from thirst is not,
   during this weakness or imperfection of it, eternal, or privileged
   against dissolution."

   Ans. "That we cannot thirst under the enjoyment of the life promised
   proves this life not here to be enjoyed, is proved, because the
   eternalness of this life is the cause of its exemption from thirst;"
   but that the plain contrary is the intendment of the Holy Ghost, I
   presume is evident to all men. The reason of our preservation to
   eternal life, and being carried on thereunto, is apparently assigned to
   those supplies of the Spirit whereby our thirst is taken away. The
   taking away of our thirst is the certain means of our eternal life, not
   a consequent of the eternity of it. All the proof of what is here
   asserted is, "Let the whole passage be read and minded;" in which
   appeal I dare acquiesce before the judgment-seat of any believer in the
   world, whose concernment this is. It is here, then, supposed that the
   eternity of the life promised is the cause of their not thirsting in
   whom it is, which is beside the text; and that they may thirst again
   (in the sense spoken of) who drink of that water of the Spirit which
   Christ gives, which is contrary unto it. And of these two supposals is
   this part of this discourse composed.

   The ensuing discourse, rendering a reason upon the account whereof life
   may be called eternal, though it be interrupted and cut off, we shall
   have farther time, God assisting, to consider, and to declare its utter
   inconsistency with the intendment of the Holy Ghost in the expressions
   now before us.

   He adds then, in the last place, sect. 12, "That the intendment of
   Christ is not that the water he gives shall always end in the issue of
   eternal life, but that it lies in a tendency thereunto."

   Ans. Which, upon the matter, is all one as if he had said, "Christ
   saith, indeed, that the water which he gives shall spring up into
   everlasting life, and wholly remove that thirst which is comprehensive
   of all interveniencies that might hinder it" (as God said to Adam, "In
   the day that thou eatest of that fruit, thou shalt surely die"), "but
   he knew full well that it might otherwise come to pass;" -- which,
   whether it doth not amount to a calling of his truth and credit in his
   words and promises into question, deserves, as I suppose, Mr Goodwin's
   serious consideration. To conclude, then, our Saviour hath assured us
   that the living water which he gives us shall take away such thirst,
   all such total want of grace and Spirit (be it to be brought about, not
   by this or that means, but by what means soever), as should cause us to
   come short of eternal life with himself; which we shall look upon as a
   promise of the saints' perseverance in faith, notwithstanding all the
   exceptions which as yet to the contrary have been produced.

   Having thus long insisted on this influence of the mediation of Christ
   into the continuance of the love and favour of God unto believers, by
   procuring the Spirit for them, sending him to them, to "dwell in them
   and abide with them for ever" (the most effectual principle of their
   continuance with God), give me leave farther to confirm the truth of
   what hath been spoken by remarking some inferences which the Scripture
   holds out unto us, upon a supposition of those assertions which we have
   laid down concerning the indwelling of the Spirit., and the assistance
   which we receive from him on that account, all tending to the end and
   purpose we have in hand; as, --

   First, Because "the Spirit dwelleth in us," we are therefore to
   consider and dispose of our persons as "temples of the Holy Ghost," --
   that is, of this indwelling Spirit; the Scripture manifesting hereby
   that the doctrine of the indwelling of the Spirit is not only a truth,
   but a very useful truth, being made the fountain of and the enforcement
   unto so great a duty. He dwells in us, and we are to look well to his
   habitation. Our Saviour tells us, that when the evil spirit finds his
   dwelling "swept and garnished," Matt. xii. 44, he instantly takes
   possession, and brings company with him. He will not be absent from it
   when it is fitted for his turn. In reference to the saints and their
   holy Indweller, this the apostle urgeth, 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20, "Your body
   is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you:" whence he concludes,
   "Ye are not your own," and therefore ought to "glorify God in your
   body." From hence is the strength of his argument for the avoiding of
   all uncleanness: Verses 16-19, "Know ye not that he which is joined to
   an harlot is one body? He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
   Flee fornication. Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
   Ghost?" On this account, also, doth he press to universal holiness: 1
   Cor. iii. 16, 17, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that
   the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God,
   him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye
   are." In verses 12-15, the apostle discovers the fruitlessness of
   building "hay and stubble," light and unsound doctrines or practices,
   upon the foundation of faith in Jesus Christ once laid, and tells us
   that all such things shall burn and suffer loss, and put the contrivers
   and workers of them to no small difficulty in escaping, like men when
   the garments they are clothed withal are on fire about them. On the
   account of this sad event of foolish and careless walking, he presses,
   verse 16, as was said, earnestly to universal holiness, laying down as
   the great motive thereunto that which we have insisted on, namely, the
   indwelling of the Holy Spirit in us: "Know ye not that ye are the
   temple of God?" -- "The temple wherein God of old did dwell was built
   with hewn stone and cedar-wood, and overlaid with pure gold; and will
   ye now, who are the spiritual temple of God, build up your souls with
   hay and stubble? which he furthers by that dreadful commination taken
   from the zeal of God for the purity of his temple. So that on each hand
   he doth press to the universal close keeping of our hearts in all
   holiness and purity, because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And,
   indeed, wherever we are said to be temples of God, or a habitation for
   him, as it still relates to this cause of the expression which we now
   insist upon, so there is ever some intimation of holiness to be pursued
   on that account: Eph. ii. 21, 22, "In whom all the building fitly
   framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye
   also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit."
   Being made "an habitation of God" by the Spirit's indwelling in us, we
   grow up, or thrive in grace, into a holy temple to the Lord, to be a
   more complete and well-furnished habitation for him.

   This, then, is that which I say: The truth of what hath formerly been
   spoken concerning the manner of the Spirit's abode with us, being
   procured for us by Jesus Christ, is farther cleared by this inference
   that the Scripture makes thereof. The saints are exhorted with all
   diligence to keep themselves a fit habitation for him, that they may
   not be unclean and defiled lodgings for the Spirit of purity and
   holiness. This is, and this is to be, their daily labour and endeavour,
   that vain thoughts, unruly passions, corrupt lusts, may not take up any
   room in their bosom; that they put not such unwelcome and unsavoury
   inmates upon the Spirit of grace; that sin may not dwell where God
   dwells. On this ground they may plead with their own souls, and say,
   "Hath the Lord chosen my poor heart for his habitation? Hath he said, I
   delight in it, and there will I dwell for ever?' Hath he forsaken that
   goodly and stately material temple whereunto he gave his especial
   presence of old, to take up his abode in a far more eminent way in a
   poor sinful soul? Doth that Holy Spirit which dwells in Jesus Christ,
   who was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,' who did no
   sin, neither was guile found in his mouth,' dwell also in me, that am
   in and of myself wholly corrupted and defiled? And shall I be so
   foolish, so unthankful, as willingly to defile the habitation which he
   hath chosen? Shall I suffer vain thoughts, foolish lusts, distempered
   affections, worldly aims, to put in themselves upon him there? He is a
   Spirit of grace; can he bear a graceless corruption to be cherished in
   his dwelling? He is a Spirit of holiness; and shall I harbour in his
   lodging a frame of worldliness? He is a Spirit of joy and consolation;
   and shall I fill my bosom with foolish fears and devouring cares? Would
   not this be a grief unto him? would it not provoke the eyes of his
   glory? Can he bear it, that when he is with me, before his face, in his
   presence, I should spend my time in giving entertainment to his
   enemies? He is the High and the Holy One who dwells in eternity, and he
   hath chosen to inhabit with me also; surely I should be more brutish
   than any man should I be careless of his habitation. And should not
   this fill my soul with a holy scorn and indignation against sin? Shall
   I debase my soul unto any vile lust, which hath this exceeding honour,
   to be a habitation for the Spirit of God? Hence, upon a view of any
   defilement of lust or passion, nothing troubles the saints more, nor
   fills them with more self-abhorrence and confusion of face, than this,
   that they have rendered their hearts an unsuitable habitation for the
   Spirit of God. This makes David, upon his sin, cry so earnestly that
   the Spirit might not depart from him, being conscious to himself that
   he had exceedingly defiled his dwelling-place, Ps. li. 11. And were
   this consideration always fresh upon the spirits of the saints, were it
   more constant in their thoughts, it would keep them more upon their
   guard that nothing might break in to disquiet their gracious Indweller.

   Secondly, Because by the Spirit we have guidance and direction, there
   is wisdom given unto us, and we are called to a holy discerning between
   the directions of the Spirit of grace and the delusions of the spirit
   of the world and the seduction of our own hearts. Christ gives this
   character of his sheep, that they "hear him, know his voice, and follow
   him," but "a stranger they will not follow," John x. 3-5. Christ speaks
   by his Spirit; in his guidance and direction is the voice of the Lord
   Jesus: "He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
   unto the churches," Rev. ii. 29. What Christ saith as to the fountain
   of revelation, he being the great prophet of the church, that the
   Spirit saith as to the efficacy of the revelation unto the hearts of
   the saints; and as "the unction teacheth them," so do they "abide in
   Christ," 1 John ii. 27. The seducements of the spirit of the world,
   either immediately by himself or mediately by others, are the voice of
   strangers. Between these and the voice of the Spirit of Christ that
   dwells in them, the saints have a spirit of discerning. This the
   apostle affirms, 1 Cor. ii. 15, "He that is spiritual judgeth all
   things." He discerneth between things, and judgeth aright of them. He
   "judgeth all things;" that is, all things of that nature whereof he
   speaks; that is, "the things which are freely given to us of God,"
   verse 12, for the discerning and knowledge whereof the Spirit is given
   them: for "the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God,"
   verse 11. They know also the suggestions of the spirit of the world,
   and judge them: 2 Cor. ii. 11, "We are not ignorant of his devices."
   There is a twofold knowledge of the depths and devices of Satan:-- one
   with approbation, to the embracing and practice of them; the other with
   condemnation, to their hatred and rejection. The first ye have
   mentioned Rev. ii. 24 "As many as have not known the depths of Satan,
   as they speak," -- their "doctrinal depths," so they call them; of them
   our Saviour there speaks. New doctrines were broached by Satan, --
   unintelligible notions. Some pretended to attain an acquaintance with
   them; and boasted, it seems, in them as very great and high
   attainments. They called them "depths," such as poor ordinary
   believers, that contented themselves with their low forms, could not
   reach unto. Saith Christ, "They are depths, as they speak;" -- indeed,
   in themselves nothing at all, things of no solidity, weight, nor
   wisdom; but, as managed by Satan, they are depths indeed, such as
   whereby he destroys their souls. And as some approve his doctrinal
   depths, so some close with his practical depths and embrace them, men
   that study his ways and paths, becoming desperately wicked, maliciously
   scoffing at religion, and despising the profession of it. But there is
   a knowledge also of the depths and devices of Satan leading to judging,
   condemning, rejecting, and watching against them. The suggestions of
   Satan, in their infinite variety, their rise, progress, efficacy, and
   advantages, their various aims and tendencies unto sin against grace, I
   do not now consider. But this I say, those who are "led by the Spirit
   of God," who have directions and guidance from him, they discern
   between the voice of the Spirit which dwells in them and the voice of
   the spirit which dwells in the world.

   Now, because this is not always to be done from the manner of their
   speaking, the serpent counterfeiting the voice of the dove, and coming
   on, not only with earnestness and continuance of impulse, but with many
   fair and specious pretences, making good his impressions, labouring to
   win the understanding over to that wherewith he enticeth the affections
   and passions of men, they use the help of such considerations as these
   ensuing, to give them direction in attending to the voice of that Guide
   which leads them into the paths of truth, and to stop their ears to the
   songs of Satan, which would transform them into monsters of
   disobedience. Thus they know, --

   1. That all the motions of the Holy Spirit, whereby they are and ought
   to be led, are regular; that he moves them to nothing but what is
   according to the mind of Christ, delivered in the word which he hath
   appointed for their rule to walk by, to no duty but what is acceptable
   to him, and what he hath revealed so to be. So that as believers are to
   try the spirits of others by that standard, whether they are of God or
   no, because of the subtlety of Satan, transforming himself into an
   angel of light, yea, into a spirit of duty, whatever immediate motions
   and impressions fall upon their spirits, they try them by the rule, 1
   John iv. 1. It is no dishonour to the Holy Spirit, yea, it is a great
   honour, to have his motions within us tried by the word that he hath
   given for a rule without us; yea, when any preached by immediate
   inspiration, he commends those who examined what they delivered by that
   which he had given out before, Acts xvii. 11. He doth not now move in
   us to give a new rule, but a new light and power, as was said before.
   The motions of the spirit of the world are for the most part unto
   things wherein, though the persons with whom he deals may be in the
   dark, or blind, and darkened by him, yet themselves are against the
   rule, or beside it, in the whole or in part, in respect of some such
   circumstances as vitiate the whole performance.

   2. They know that the commands and motions of the Spirit which dwells
   in them are not grievous, 1 John v. 3. The commands of Christ, for the
   matter of them, are not grievous; "his yoke is easy, his burden is
   light," Matt. xi. 30. And the manner whereby we are carried out to the
   performance of them is not grievous: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is,
   there is liberty," 2 Cor. iii. 17. It carries out the soul to duty in a
   free, sweet, calm, ingenuous manner. The motions of the spirit of the
   world, even unto good things and duties (for so, for farther ends of
   his, it often falls out that they are), are troublesome, vexatious,
   perplexing, grievous, and tumultuating. Satan falls like lightning upon
   the soul, and comes upon the powers of it as a tempest. Hence acting in
   any thing upon his closing with and provoking our convictions, is
   called a being under the "spirit of bondage," Rom. viii. 15; which is
   opposed to the "Spirit of God, the Spirit of adoption, of liberty,
   boldness, power, and a sound mind."

   3. They know that all motions of the Spirit whereby they are led are
   orderly. As is God's covenant with us, "ordered in all things," so the
   Spirit of God carries us out unto every duty in its own order and
   season; whereas we see some poor souls to be in such bondage as to be
   hurried up and down, in the matter of duties, at the pleasure of Satan.
   They must run from one to another, and commonly neglect that which they
   should do. When they are at prayer, then they should be at the work of
   their calling; and when they are at their calling, they are tempted for
   not laying all aside and running to prayer. Believers know that this is
   not from the Spirit of God, which makes "every thing beautiful in its
   season."

   4. They know that all the workings of the Spirit of God, as they are
   good, so also they tend unto a good end. Doth that stir them up to
   close walking with God? -- it is that God may be glorified, his graces
   exercised in them, their souls strengthened in obedience, and their
   progress in sanctification furthered. Doth it assure them of the love
   of God? -- it is that they may be more humble, thankful, and watchful.
   Whereas all the compliances and combinations of Satan, and men's
   corrupt hearts, even when they compel to good duties, are for false,
   evil, and corrupt ends. Duty is pressed to pacify conscience, peace is
   given to make men secure, gifts are stirred up to tempt to pride; and,
   indeed, it may easily be observed that the devil never doth any work
   but he will quickly come for his wages.

   By the help, I say, of these and such like considerations, the saints
   of God, in whom this Spirit doth dwell, are enabled to discern and know
   the voice of their leader and guide from the nearest resemblance of it
   that the spirit which is in the world doth or at any time can make show
   of. And this indwelling of the Spirit yields a considerable
   contribution of strength towards the confirmation of the main theses
   undertaken to be proved. Our adversaries dispute about the removal of
   acquired habits; but how infused habits may be cast out or expelled
   they have not [in] any tolerable measure been able to declare. If,
   moreover, it shall be evinced, as it hath been by plentiful testimonies
   of Scripture, that the Holy Ghost himself dwells in believers, what way
   can be fixed on for his expulsion? That he cannot be removed but by his
   own will, the will of him that sends him, I suppose will easily be
   granted. Whilst he abides with them, they are accepted with God, and in
   covenant with him. That God, whilst his children are in such a state
   and condition, doth take away his Spirit from them, and give them up to
   the power of the devil, is incumbent on our adversaries to prove.

   But to return at length from this digression. Thus far have we
   proceeded in manifesting, upholding, and vindicating, that influence
   which the oblation of Christ hath into the preservation of the saints
   in the love and favour of God unto the end. His intercession, being
   eminently effectual also to the same end and purpose, comes in the next
   place to be considered.

Chapter IX. The intercession of Christ.

   The nature of it -- Its aim, not only that believers continuing so may
   be saved, but that they may be preserved in believing -- This farther
   proved from the typical intercession of the Judaical high priest -- The
   tenor of Christ's intercession, as manifested John xvii. 11, opened,
   and verses 12-15 -- The result of the argument from thence -- The
   saints' perseverance fully confirmed -- Rom. viii. 33, 34 at large
   explained -- Mr G.'s interpretation of the place in all the parts of it
   confuted -- Vain supposals groundlessly interserted into the apostle's
   discourse -- What Christ intercedes for for believers farther
   manifested -- The sum of what is assigned to the intercession of Christ
   by Mr G. -- How far it is all from yielding the least consolation to
   the saints manifested -- The reasons of the foregoing interpretation
   proposed and answered -- The end assigned of the intercession of Christ
   answered -- God works perseverance actually -- A supply of means that
   may not be effectual not to be ascribed thereunto -- Farther objections
   answered: Christ not the minister of sin by this doctrine -- Supposals
   and instances upon the former interpretation disproved and rejected --
   A brief account of our doctrine concerning the intercession of Christ
   for believers, and of the true end of the act of his mediation -- The
   close of the argument, and of the first part of this treatise.

   Of the intercession of Christ, both as to the nature of its typical
   representation by the high priest's entering into the holy of holies
   every year with blood, Heb. ix. 7, and its effectual influence into the
   perfect, complete salvation of believers, so much hath been spoken by
   others, and the whole of the doctrine delivered with so much clearness,
   spiritualness, and strength, that I shall not need to add any thing
   thereunto. That Christ intercedes for the preservation of believers in
   the love and favour of his Father to the end is that which I intend to
   manifest, and which may, as I suppose, be very easily undeniably
   evinced. Some few considerations will make way for the demonstration of
   the truth which is under consideration, or confirmation of the
   perseverance of saints from the intercession of Christ:--

   1. The intercession of Christ being his appearance for us in the
   presence of God (Heb. ix. 24, he is gone into heaven emphanisthenai to
   prosoto tou Theou, to make a legal appearance for our defence before
   the judgment-seat of God, and by being there is our advocate, 1 John
   ii. 1; he is said to "be able to save us to the uttermost," Heb. vii.
   25), there is certainly something or other that he puts in for in the
   behalf of them in whose cause he appears and sues, that so he may save
   them to the utmost, Now, this must be either that, being and continuing
   believers, they may be saved, or that they may believe and continue
   believers unto salvation. That the first is not the sole import and aim
   of the intercession of Christ may be manifested from this double
   consideration:--

   (1.) From the nature of the thing itself. There is nothing but the
   establishment of the very law of the gospel ("He that believeth shall
   be saved,") wrapped up in this interpretation of the intercession of
   Christ. But this neither hath Christ any need to intercede for, it
   being ratified, confirmed, and declared from the beginning; neither is
   there, nor can there be, any opposition made against it, to shake,
   weaken, or disturb it in the least, it depending solely on the truth
   and unchangeableness of God, not being vested, by any condition
   whatsoever, in any other subject. (2.) Nor would this be availing to
   his militant church, whose preservation he aims at and intends in his
   intercession; for the whole of his desires may be granted him to the
   uttermost, and yet his whole church at any time militant perish for
   ever. Though not one soul should continue believing to the end, though
   the gates of hell should prevail against every one that names the name
   of Christ in the world, yet that truth, "He that believeth shall be
   saved," taken in the sense of our adversaries, for a promise to
   perseverance in believing, and not a promise to actual true believers,
   might stand firm for ever. To say, then, that this is the whole
   intercession of Christ for his church, is to say that in his whole
   intercession he interceded not at all for his church. He is heard in
   his intercession, and he may be heard to the uttermost in this, and yet
   his whole church be so far from being saved to the utmost as utterly to
   be destroyed and consumed, John xi. 42.

   2. Doubtless the intercession of Christ must answer the representation
   of it which the apostle so much insists on, Heb. vii.-ix. Of the
   oblation of Christ there were many types in the Aaronical priesthood of
   the law; of his intercession but one principally, -- namely, that
   solemn entrance of the high priest with blood and incense into the
   holiest of holies, in the great anniversary sacrifice on the tenth day
   of the seventh month: on the which day, also, the great jubilee or
   joyful time of deliverance, typifying our deliverance by Christ, began.
   Hereunto is added the priesthood of Melchizedek, whereof there is
   mention neither of its beginning nor ending, to secure us of the
   continuance of our Mediator in the act of his priesthood for ever. Now,
   the end of the high priest's so entering into this holy place, was to
   carry on the work of expiation and atonement to perfection, and
   complete peace with God in the behalf of them for whom he offered
   without; and therefore the Holy Ghost saith that his entrance with
   blood was to "offer for himself, and for the errors of the people,"
   Heb. ix. 7, it being but a continuation of his oblation begun without
   unto a complete atonement. And therefore there is no real difference
   between the efficacy of the death of Christ, and that of his
   intercession upon the actual accomplishment of it. It being, then, the
   complete taking away of the sins and errors of the people, as to the
   guilt of them, and the continuance of their peace with God, which was
   intended by the high priest's entrance with blood into the holiest of
   holies, that which answers thereunto, or the deliverance of believers
   from the whole guilt of sin, and their preservation in the love and
   favour of God, is the intendment of Christ in his intercession. Let the
   effects and fruits of the oblation of Christ be bounded and limited to
   the procuring of a new way of salvation, without purchasing for any one
   person whatever power and grace to walk in that way, and then exclude
   his intercession from any influence into the preservation of them who
   do enter that way therein, and perhaps indifferent men will scarce
   think the glory and honour of the Lord Jesus to be of any great regard
   with us.

   3. That this is the import of Christ's intercession for believers is
   evident by that preface which we have thereof, John xvii., being a
   manifest declaration on earth of that which Christ lives in heaven to
   do. This was the incense wherewith he entered into the holy place,
   which he now prepared, and which was afterward beaten small in his
   agony, that it might be ready to make a sweet perfume at his entrance
   into heaven, as he was sprinkled with his own blood. That Christ
   intercedeth, and for his elect, for whom he died, that they may
   believe, our adversaries deny; but that he intercedes for actual
   believers hath not hitherto been questioned. What it is which he
   requests on their behalf, the tenor of that prayer of his, John xvii.,
   will manifest. Verse 11, saith he, "Holy Father, keep through thine own
   name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are;"
   -- "Keep them from sin and ruin, from every thing that will hinder them
   from union with me." What is it that our Saviour here prays for, and
   for whom is he so engaged? That it is for believers, as such, for whom
   he puts up these supplications, our adversaries in the cause in hand do
   contend. That these may be kept through the power of God unto unity
   among themselves, which they have by their union with him, is his dying
   request for them. He prays not for such oneness as is consistent with
   their separation from his and his Father's love. Where now shall we fix
   the supposed failure of those who effectually and eventually are kept
   up to spiritual union, who cannot fall out of nor fall off from
   (totally nor finally) the love of God? Either Christ is not heard in
   his request, or the Father cannot keep them by his power, if these thus
   interceded for are not preserved. Many temptations, many oppositions,
   great tribulations without, strong corruptions within, they must needs
   meet withal: these they have no power in themselves to overcome nor to
   resist. Should they be left to themselves, they would never be able to
   hold out to the end. Saith Christ, "I shall lose these poor sheep for
   whom I have laid down my life' to bring them unto thee. Holy Father, do
   thou therefore keep and preserve them from all these evils, that they
   may not prevail over them. And keep them through thy name,' thy power"
   (for we are "kept through the power of God unto salvation"); "let thy
   power be exerted for their preservation. And what is too strong for thy
   power? Who can take them out of thy hand? Lay that upon them for their
   defence, show it out in their behalf, that all their enemies may feel
   the weight and strength thereof. Keep them through thy name,' thy
   grace; let that be sufficient for them. Let them have such supplies of
   gospel grace and pardoning mercy (concerning which I manifested thy
   name unto them, verse 6, and so revealed thee [as] a Father), that they
   may be encouraged to trust in that name of thine, and to stay
   themselves upon thee." Where the failure is, doubtless is not easy to
   manifest. In the verses following our Saviour adds many motives to make
   his intercession prevalent in their behalf:--

   First, Verse 12, he saith that, according to that commission that he
   had received, he had faithfully preserved them whilst that he was in
   the world; and now being ready to leave them, as to his bodily
   presence, he urges the special preservation of his Father as needful,
   that after all the care and cost which he had laid out about them, they
   might not utterly perish. And then, --

   Secondly, Verse 13, he urges the necessity that they should have some
   assurance of it in the midst of all their troubles and trials, that
   they may have consolation upon their confidence in the words which
   Christ had spoken to them, that they should be preserved through all
   difficulties unto the end. And he farther urges, --

   Thirdly, Verse 14, from the certain opposition that they should meet
   withal, "?The world hateth them,' and will, without doubt, use all ways
   and means possible for their ruin and destruction;" giving also the
   reason why the world hateth them, and will oppose them, which is such
   an one as must needs engage the heart and good-will of God for their
   preservation, to wit, because they received the word of his dear Son,
   and upon that account left the world, separated from it, and became its
   enemies. And shall they now be left to the rage and fury of the world
   in this condition. "That be far from thee; holy Father, keep them.'?"
   Hereupon, --

   Fourthly, Verse 15, he reneweth his prayer in their behalf, with a
   farther opening of his mind as to what he had last spoken of. "The
   world," the world being vile, wretched, deceitful, and set upon
   opposition against them, a man would have thought that the Lord Jesus
   should have desired that his saints might be taken out from the midst
   of this world, and set in a quiet place by themselves, where they might
   no more be troubled with the baits and oppositions of it. But this is
   not that which he requests. He hath another work for them to do in the
   world. They are to bear witness to him and his truth by their faith and
   obedience, to convince the wicked, unbelieving world; they are to
   glorify his name by doing and suffering for him: so that this is no
   part of his request. "I pray not," saith he, "that thou shouldest take
   them out of the world, but that they may not be prevailed on nor
   conquered by the evil that is in the world; that they may be kept and
   preserved from the power of evil, which would separate them from me and
   my love." This he presseth for, and this he is heard in; and that not
   only for his apostles and present followers, but as he tells you, verse
   20, for all that should believe on him to the end of the world.

   The things prayed for, the reason of his intercession, the opposition
   against the accomplishment of the things interceded for, the
   distinction put between them for whom he intercedes and the perishing
   world, -- all delivered in plain and expressive terms, -- evidently
   evince the intendment of Christ in his intercession to regard the
   safeguarding of believers in the love and favour of God, by their
   continuance in believing, and preservation from the power of
   temptations and oppositions arising against their perseverance in
   communion with God.

   The result of what hath been spoken, as to its influence into the
   confirmation of the truth under demonstration, amounts unto thus much:
   That which the Lord Jesus, as mediator, requesteth and prayeth for
   continually of the Father, according to his mind, in order to the
   accomplishment of the promises made to him and covenant with him (all
   his desires being bottomed upon his exact, perfect performance of the
   whole will of God, both in doing and suffering), that shall certainly
   be accomplished and brought to pass; but thus, in this manner, upon
   these accounts, doth the Lord Jesus intercede for the perseverance of
   believers, and their preservation in the love of the Father unto the
   end: therefore, they shall undoubtedly be so preserved. It is confessed
   that the persons interceded for are believers, all believers that then
   were, or should be to the end of the world (the efficacy of this
   intercession having commenced from the foundation thereof); the thing
   prayed for is their preservation in the state of union with Christ and
   one another; the motives used for the obtaining this request in their
   behalf are taken from the work they have to do, and the opposition they
   were to meet withal. And all the saints being thus put into the hand of
   God, who shall take them from thence? On what account is it that they
   shall not be preserved? To say they shall be thus preserved in case
   themselves depart not wilfully from God, is to say they shall be
   preserved in case they preserve themselves, as will afterward be
   farther manifested.

   This argument is proposed by the apostle in the most triumphant
   assurance of the truth and certainty of the inference contained in it
   that he anywhere useth, in any case whatsoever: Rom. viii. 33, 34, "Who
   shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
   also maketh intercession for us." He lays the immunity of the elect and
   justified persons from just crimination or condemnation on the
   foundation of the oblation and intercession of Christ. The first part
   of this argument from the oblation of Christ ("Who shall condemn? It is
   Christ that died"), asserting the immunity of believers from
   condemnation, upon the account of the punishing of all their sins in
   Christ, and the perfect satisfaction made by his death for them, whence
   the justice of God in the issue will not have any thing to lay to their
   charge, we have formerly insisted on; the other, which the apostle
   induces emphatically and comparatively, though not in respect of
   procurement and purchase made, yet of assurance to be given, with
   mallon de, in respect of his oblation, is that now before us. To make
   the assurance of believers plentiful, that they may know both the truth
   of his first general assertion, that all things shall work together for
   good to them, and this particular conclusion, now laid down by way of
   interrogation, rejecting all evil opposed to their former enjoyments,
   "Who shall lay any thing to their charge? who shall condemn?" he gives
   them a threefold consideration of the state and actings of the Lord
   Christ, after the expiation of their sins by his blood, in reference to
   them:-- 1. "He is risen;" 2. "He is at the right hand of God;" 3.
   "Maketh intercession for them:" -- the first denoting his acquitment,
   and theirs in him (for he died in their stead), from all the sins that
   were charged on him; for he was declared to be the Son of God, accepted
   with him, and justified from all that debt which he undertook, in his
   resurrection. And if he be risen, who shall lay any thing to the charge
   of them whom he died for, and for all whose sins, in their stead, he
   was acquitted? The second is his exaltation and power; for "having
   purged our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,"
   Heb. i. 3, receiving thereby a most plenary demonstration of his
   Father's goodwill to him and his, in respect of the work that he had
   undertaken and gone through for them: for if he had not "made an end of
   sin," when he was "obedient unto death, the death of the cross," he
   could not expect that God should give him "a name above every name,"
   with fullness of power to give eternal life to all that the Father gave
   him. This to assure us that he will do, having power in his own hand,
   the apostle adds, "Who also intercedes for us;" hereby, thirdly,
   testifying abundantly his good-will and care for our salvation. Upon
   these considerations, the apostle leads the faith of the saints of God
   to make a conclusion, which is to be believed as a divine truth, that
   tenders to us the doctrine we have under demonstration triumphant
   against all objections and oppositions that can be made against it, And
   hence we thus argue: Those against whom no charge can be laid, who
   cannot by any means be separated from the love of God in Christ, cannot
   totally and finally fall away from faith, and fail out of God's favour.
   But that this is the condition of all true believers is evident from
   the context. It is of all that are called according to the purpose of
   God, justified, and sanctified, -- the proper description of all and
   only believers, -- that the apostle affirms these things, and to whom
   he ascribes the condition mentioned. Now, that this is the state and
   condition of those persons, the apostle manifesteth from the causes of
   it, -- namely, the oblation and intercession of Christ in their behalf;
   for those for whom he died and doth intercede are on that account
   exempted from any such charge as might be of prevalency to separate
   them from God.

   Mr Goodwin attempts, indeed, once more to re-enforce the triumphed-over
   enemies of the saints, and to call them once more to make bead against
   the intercession of Christ; but with what ill success, the
   consideration of what arguments he useth with them and for them will
   demonstrate. Thus, then, he addresseth himself to his task, chap. xi.
   sect. 33, p. 248, "I answer, It is nowhere affirmed that Christ
   intercedes for the perseverance of the saints in their faith, or they
   who once believed should never cease believing, how sinful and wicked
   soever they should prove afterward; but Christ intercedes for his
   saints as such, and so continuing such, that no accusation from any
   hand whatsoever may be heard against them, that no afflictions or
   sufferings which they meet with in the world may cause any alienation
   or abatement in the love of God towards them, but that God will protect
   and preserve them under them, and consequently that they may be
   maintained at an excellent rate of consolation in every state and
   condition, and against all interposures of any creature to the
   contrary."

   This answer hath long since ceased to be new to us; it is that, indeed,
   which is the shield behind which Mr Goodwin lies, to avoid the force of
   all manner of arguments pointed against himself, though it be the most
   weak and frivolous that ever, I suppose, was used in so weighty a
   matter. It is here cast (as he hath many moulds and shapes to cast it
   in) into a denial of the assumption of our syllogism, and a reason of
   that denial. First, he denies that Christ intercedes for believers that
   they may persevere in their faith; he prays not for their perseverance.

   His reason of this is twofold:-- 1. A supposal that "they may prove so
   wicked as not to continue believing." 2. A description of what Christ
   intercedes for in the behalf of believers, namely, "that they may
   continue in God's love if they do continue to believe, notwithstanding
   all their afflictions." "Homo homini quid interest?" Whether men will
   or no, these must pass for oracular dictates.

   1. For the first, let what hath been spoken already be weighed, and see
   if there be not yet hope left for poor souls that Christ prays for them
   that their faith fail not. And, by the way, who will not embrace this
   comfortable doctrine, that will assure him, in his agonies,
   temptations, and failings, that all help and supplies are made out to
   him from and by the Lord Jesus, in whom is all his hope, and that he
   receives of his Father, upon his intercession, all the fruits of his
   death and blood-shedding in his behalf; but that he should believe, or,
   being tempted, should be preserved in believing, of that Christ takes
   no thought, nor did ever intercede with his Father for any such an end
   or purpose! Such consolation might befit Job's friends: "Miserable
   comforters, physicians of no value." But of this before.

   2. For that supposal of his, of their proving wicked afterward to an
   inconsistency with believing, it hath often been corrected for a sturdy
   beggar, and sent away grumbling and hungry, and, were it not for pure
   necessity, would never once be owned any more by its master. Christ
   intercedes not for believers that they may persevere in the faith upon
   such foolish supposals, whose opposite is continuance in the faith, and
   so is coincident with the thing itself interceded for. To intercede
   that they may continue believing, is to intercede that they may never
   be so wicked as Mr Goodwin supposeth they may be. The end asserted of
   Christ's intercession for the saints is, that they may never wickedly
   depart from God. Doth Mr Goodwin indeed take this to be the tenor of
   the doctrine he opposeth, and of the argument which he undertakes to
   answer, -- namely, that the faith of believers, and the continuance of
   that, is interceded for without any reference to the work of faith in
   gospel obedience and communion with God in Christ? or if he thinks not
   so, why doth he so often insist on this calumnious evasion?

   In giving the aim of Christ in his intercession for believers, we have
   this new cogent argument against our position, "Christ intercedes for
   the things here by me mentioned; therefore he doth not intercede for
   the perseverance of the saints." But why so? Is there any inconsistency
   in these things, any repugnancy in terms, or contrariety of the things
   themselves? Christ intercedes that believers may enjoy the love of God;
   therefore he doth not intercede that they may be established in
   believing!

   The sum of all that is here ascribed to the intercession of Christ at
   the best is, That God will confirm and ratify that everlasting law,
   that believers continuing so to the end shall be saved; which whether
   it be the sum of Christ's intercession for his church or no, that
   church will judge. If there be any thing farther, or of more importance
   to them, in what is assigned to it by Mr Goodwin, it is wrapped up in
   the knot of "etc.," which I am not able to untie.

   These words of the apostle, "Who shall lay any thing to the charge of
   God's elect?" do not denote that this is the intercession of Christ for
   them, that no accusation be admitted against them whilst they believe,
   which is no more but the confirmation of that general proposition of
   the gospel before mentioned; but it is the conclusion which they make
   upon the account of the intercession of Christ, in the application of
   the promise of the gospel to their own souls. Neither is there any more
   weight in that which follows, "That there be no abatement or alienation
   of the love of God from them upon the account of their sufferings and
   afflictions;" which for the most part are for his sake. What saints of
   God were almost so much as once tempted with a conceit that God's love
   should be abated or alienated from them because they suffered for him?

   And this is the foundation of that "excellent rate of consolation at
   which the saints, upon the account of the intercession of Christ, may
   be maintained:" "Into afflictions, temptations, trials, they may fall;
   but if they continue in faith and love they shall not be rejected. No
   creature shall be heard against them; that Christ takes care for: but
   for the worst enemies they have, their own lusts, corruptions, and
   unbelief, the fiery darts of Satan fighting against their souls, with
   their continuance in believing, -- the falling from whence is indeed
   all the danger they are exposed to, for whilst they continue so doing,
   all other things are lighter than vanity, -- these Christ takes no care
   about" (though he prays that God would sanctify them and keep them),
   "but they must shift for themselves as well as they can; he will not,
   doth not intercede for them that from these they may he preserved."
   Doubtless, he that shall think to be maintained long at any high rate
   of consolation, and lays in no other nor no better provision to live on
   than this mentioned, will quickly be reduced to a dry morsel.

   But yet, some reasons of the foregoing interpretation of this place of
   the apostle, Rom. viii., are offered unto us:--

   [First], "This to be the tenor and effect of Christ's intercession for
   his saints," saith he, "is evident from the first of the three passages
   cited; and for that demand, Who shall separate us from the love of
   Christ?' it is not meant from the love wherewith we love Christ, but
   from the love wherewith Christ loveth us as we are saints, and abide in
   his love, and keep his commands. Neither is it so to be conceived as if
   sin, wickedness, looseness, profaneness, could not unsaint men, and
   thereby separate them from that love wherewith Christ some time loved
   them (for that iniquity will separate between men and their God is
   evident from Isa. lix. 2); but the clear meaning is, that nothing, no
   creature whatsoever, person or thing, can make Christ an enemy to those
   who shall in faith and love cleave fast unto him."

   Ans. All this respecteth only one expression in this one place of
   Scripture, and ariseth not with the least power against our argument,
   taken from many places in conjunction, explicatory one of another. It
   runs also upon the same mistake with the former, taking the exultation
   of believers upon the intercession of Christ in their behalf, which
   holds out the issue of it, to be expressive of the matter of his
   intercession, being only a demonstration of the event of it. But grant
   this to be the tenor and effect of Christ's intercession, that
   believers may not be separated from his love, is he heard herein, or is
   he not? Whatsoever be the issue of the question, our procedure will be
   facile. But it is said that it is not "the love wherewith we love
   Christ, but that wherewith he loveth us, that we shall not be separated
   from." Take this also for granted, that it is that, and that only, will
   this advantage your cause? If we be never separated from that love that
   Christ bears us, is it possible we should wholly be separated from that
   love that we bear him? Wherein consists our separation from that love
   that Christ bears us? How is it caused, or may it be procured? Is it
   not by the loss of our faith and love to him? or, at least, is it not
   an inseparable consequence thereof? or can it possibly come to pass any
   otherwise than on that account? If, then, he intercedes that we may not
   be separated from that love he bears us, and that love infers the
   continuance of ours, doth he not withal intercede that we may never
   lose that love wherewith we love him, by which we continue in his love?
   If the old shift be not at hand for a relief, this young part of the
   answer will instantly suffer loss. It is added therefore, "He loveth us
   as we are saints and abide in his love," -- that is (for so we must
   understand it), whilst we are so; for that he bears any effectual love
   to us to keep us up to saintship, that is denied. It is true, Christ
   loveth us as saints, and as abiding in his commandments; but it is also
   his love to keep us, and he intercedeth that we may abide, in that
   condition wherein alone it is possible for us so to do. Neither is the
   question whether sin, looseness, profaneness, do not separate between
   God and men, more or less; but whether believers shall not be preserved
   from such looseness and profaneness as would make a total separation
   between God and them? And if God [Christ?] intercedes, as is added in
   the close, that nothing may make him an enemy to us, certainly he must
   intercede that no sin may do it, -- for indeed sin is something in this
   business, -- and this must be as to the keeping us from it. I suppose
   no man thinks any thing in all this discourse of Mr Goodwin's to look
   like the least attempt of proof that Christ doth not intercede for the
   perseverance of saints; neither hath he confidence enough positively to
   deny it, and therefore spends his whole discourse hereabout in evasions
   and diversions. Let it be directly denied that Christ doth not intend
   that the faith of believers may not fail, that his saints may be
   preserved and saved, and we know what we have to apply ourselves unto;
   and if the contrary cannot be proved, the saints know what they have to
   trust unto, that they may no longer lean on that which will yield them
   no supportment. If this will not be, let it on the other hand be
   granted that he doth so intercede; for "de unoquoque affirmare, aut
   negare, verum est." As to this, then, he proceeds:--

   Secondly, "Were it granted that part of Christ's intercession for his
   saints is, that their faith may never fail, yet the intent thereof
   would not necessarily, nor indeed with any competent probability, be
   this, that no sin nor wickedness whatsoever that shall or can be
   perpetrated by them might cause them to make shipwreck of their faith,
   but rather that God would graciously vouchsafe such means and such a
   presence of his Spirit unto them as whereby they may be richly enabled
   to keep themselves in faith and good conscience to the end."

   Ans. Whether prejudiced men will grant it or no, it is clearly proved,
   if the words of Christ themselves may be taken for proof, that he
   intercedes for his saints that their faith may not fail, and that
   notwithstanding the interposition of any such sins as they can or may
   ("suppositis supponendis," amongst which is his intercession) fall
   into. So he tells Peter, upon the prediction of his dreadful fall, that
   nevertheless he had prayed for him that his faith should not fail. That
   they may fall into such sins, and continue in such, as are inconsistent
   with their acceptation with God, according to the terms and tenor of
   the new covenant, is that which we have been disproving all this while,
   and which our author ought not, as he doth in all his reasonings, to
   suppose. In the not failing or dying of their faith, in their
   preservation therein, is included their deliverance from the
   perpetration of the sins intimated, or at least from such a manner of
   committing any sin as should utterly separate them from God. It is the
   continuance of a living faith that Christ prays for; and where that is,
   there will be works of new obedience, and there will be the work of
   that faith in purifying the heart and mortifying of the sins supposed.
   Farther; the way here prescribed and limited to the Lord Jesus how he
   shall intercede for his, and for what, -- namely, not for actual
   perseverance and continuance in the faith to be wrought in them by the
   exceeding greatness of the power of God, but for means to enable them
   to preserve themselves, -- we are persuaded he walks not in; and that
   much upon this account, that the way whereby God begins and carries on
   believers in the way of faith and obedience is not by such a supply of
   means as leaves them to themselves to work and effect the things for
   which they are so supplied, but he himself "works in them to will and
   to do of his own good pleasure, fulfilling in them all the good
   pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power," giving them
   all their sufficiency, and preserving them by his power "through faith
   unto salvation." To make faith, and perseverance therein, to follow
   such a supply of means as leaves the production of them to the power of
   the wills of men, so that after God hath done all that on his part is
   to be done or performed, -- that is, quickened them being dead, giving
   them new hearts and spirits, shone into their minds, to give them the
   knowledge of his glory in the face of his Son, etc., -- it is yet
   uncertain whether ever faith shall be wrought in their souls or no, or
   rather whether men so supplied with means will believe and persevere or
   no, is an assertion that will never be proved to eternity, nor, whilst
   truth is truth, is it capable of proof. "The granting of such means and
   such a presence of his Spirit, that men may be enabled to work for
   themselves," is an expression exceedingly unsuited to all the promises
   of the new covenant. Whatever either of the Spirit of grace or the
   means of it is given out to believers, Christ intercedes that his
   Father would keep them, not that they should keep themselves. He was
   too well acquainted with our frame and our temptations to desire we
   might be our own keepers. God forbid we should be left to our own
   preservation, to the hand of our own counsel and power, though
   compassed with all the supposed sufficient means, that may be not
   eventually effectual! God creates a defence upon our glory, and doth
   not leave it to our own safeguarding. Our salvation is not in our own
   custody. That the Father doth not keep us or preserve us, that the Son
   doth not intercede that we may be so preserved, that the Spirit doth
   not make us meet for and keep us unto the inheritance of the saints in
   light, but that in the use of means we are, as Adam was, our own
   keepers, are some of the principles of that new way of administering
   consolation to believers which Mr Goodwin hath found out. This, then,
   is the utmost which Mr Goodwin will allow to be (for disputation's
   sake, not that he really believes it) granted, that Christ intercedes
   for his saints as to their continuance and preservation in that
   condition, namely, that God would give them such means as; they may use
   or not use at their liberty, which may be effectual or not effectual,
   as their own wills shall choose to make use of them; which he also
   takes for granted to be common to all the world, and not to be peculiar
   unto believers.

   But it is farther argued, "If Christ should simply and absolutely
   intercede that no sin or wickedness whatsoever may destroy the faith of
   any true believer, and consequently deprive him of salvation, should he
   not hereby become that which the apostle rejects with indignation as
   altogether unworthy of him, I mean, a minister of sin? Is therefore
   Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.' Or whereby, or wherein, can it
   lightly be imagined that Christ should become a minister of sin, rather
   than by interceding with his Father that such and such men, how vile
   and abominable soever they shall become, may yet be precious in his
   sight, and receive a crown of righteousness from his hand? Or doth not
   such an intercession as some men put upon him, as they who make him to
   intercede simply and absolutely for the perseverance of believers in
   their faith, amount to an intercession of every whit as vile and
   unworthy import as this?"

   Ans. 1. That this is the tenor of Christ's intercession with his Father
   for men, "let them become as vile as they will, how vile and abominable
   soever, yet that they may be still precious in his sight, and that he
   would give them a crown of righteousness," Mr Goodwin knoweth full well
   not to be the doctrine of them he opposeth. If he shall otherwise
   affirm, it will be incumbent on him to produce some one author that
   hath wrote about this doctrine, in what language soever, and so stated
   it. If he be ignorant that this is not their doctrine, he ought not to
   have engaged into an opposition thereof. If he argue that it is
   otherwise, this procedure is unworthy of him. That Christ intercedes
   for his saints that they may be kept from all such sins as would
   separate them from the love and favour of his Father, for which there
   is no remedy provided in the covenant of grace, and that their faith
   may not fail or perish under such sins as they may through temptation
   fall into, is the doctrine which he opposeth, or at least ought to
   oppose, to make good his undertaking. "Now, if this be so, then," saith
   he, "is Christ the minister of sin." Why so? He sees and foretells that
   Peter should deny him thrice, yet he prays that Peter's faith may not
   fail under that sin and wickedness. Is he therefore a minister of sin?
   Because he intercedes that his saints may not be given up to the power
   of sin, nor every time they are assaulted lie conquered by sin, is he
   therefore a minister of sin? or rather a deliverer from sin? That very
   thing which Mr Goodwin affirms would make him a minister of sin, he
   affirms himself to do in the case of Peter. How he will free himself
   from this charge and imputation, ipse viderit.

   2. What it is to intercede simply and absolutely for believers, that
   they may continue believing, we are not so clear in. Christ intercedes
   that they may be preserved by the power of his Father, in and through
   the use of those means which he graciously affords them, and the
   powerful presence of the Spirit of God with them therein; and that not
   on any such absurd and foolish conditions as that they may be so
   preserved by his Father provided they preserve themselves, and continue
   believers on condition they continue to believe. And if this be of a
   "vile and unworthy import," the gospel is so too, and one of the most
   eminent graces that are inwrapped in the new covenant is so too.

   What there is farther in Mr Goodwin, sect. 34, pp. 249, 250, unto this
   argument, is either a mere repetition of what was spoken before, or a
   pressing of consequences upon such supposals as he is pleased to make
   concerning the doctrine that he doth oppose. As we cannot hinder any
   man from making what supposals they please, and suiting inferences to
   them, manifesting their skill in casting down what themselves set up,
   so we are not in the least concerned in such theatrical contests.

   What it is that we teach of the intercession of Christ for believers
   hath been sufficiently explained: the end and aim of it is, that they
   may be kept, that they may not be lost, that the evil one may not touch
   them, that they may be saved to the uttermost, and kept by the power of
   God unto salvation; all that the Lord Jesus hath for his church, either
   by his oblation or his intercession, procured, or doth procure, being
   made out unto them by the holy and blessed Spirit, which he sent them
   from his Father as the first-fruits of his undertaking for them; by and
   in the use of such means and ways as he hath appointed for them to walk
   in in reference to the end proposed. He intercedes that, through
   supplies of that Spirit, their faith fail not, that no temptation
   prevail against them, that they may have suitable helps in time of
   need, and so be preserved, according to the tenor of that
   sanctification which he is pleased to give them in this life, which is
   imperfect, not from all sins, for it is the will of God to keep them
   and walk with them in a covenant of pardoning mercy; not absolutely
   from this or that great sin, as is evident in the case of David and
   Peter, whereof, under such sins, the one lost not the Spirit nor the
   other his faith; but from such sins, or such a course or way in and
   under sin, as would disappoint him, and make his desires frustrate as
   to the end first proposed, of bringing them to glory. So that, as the
   intendment of his oblation is meritoriously, and by way of procurement,
   to take away all our sins whatsoever, and yet in the application of it
   unto us, as to the taking of them away, by purifying us to be a holy
   people unto himself, it is not perfected and completed at once, nor the
   work thereof consummated but by degrees; so in his intercession, which
   respecteth the same persons and things with his oblation, he puts in
   for our deliverance from all sins and the power of them, but so and in
   such a manner as the nature of our present condition, whilst we are in
   via, and the condition of the covenant whereinto God hath graciously
   taken us, do require.

   Through the goodness of God, we have now brought this first part to an
   end. They who are in any measure acquainted in what straits, under what
   pressing employments and urgent avocations, and in what space of time,
   this offering was provided for the sanctuary of God, will accept it in
   Him, whose it is, and from whom it was received.

Chapter X. The improvement of the doctrine.

   The improvement of the doctrine of perseverance in reference to the
   obedience and consolation of the saints -- Why its tendency to the
   promoting of their obedience is first handled, before their consolation
   -- Five previous observations concerning gospel truths in general -- 1.
   That all are to be received with equal reverence -- 2. That the end of
   them all is to work the soul into a conformity to God -- Proved by
   several scriptures, 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17; Titus i. 1, etc. -- 3. Some
   truths have a more immediate tendency hereunto than others have, 2 Cor.
   v. 14 -- 4. Most weight is to be laid by believers upon such -- 5. Men
   are not themselves to determine what truths have most in them of this
   tendency, etc. -- Gospel obedience, what it is, and why so called --
   Its nature -- 1. In the matter of it, which is all and only the will of
   God -- 2. In the form of it, which is considered -- (1.) In the
   principle setting it on work, faith -- (2.) In the manner of doing it,
   eyeing both precepts and promises -- (3.) The end aimed at in it, the
   glory of God as a rewarder, Heb. xi. 6; Rom. iv. 4 -- The principle in
   us whence it proceeds, which is the new man, the Spirit, proved, Eph.
   iii. 16-19, etc. -- What kind of motives conduce most to the carrying
   on of this obedience, namely, such as most cherish this new man, which
   they do most that discover most of the love of God and his good-will in
   Christ -- Such as these are alone useful to mortification and the
   subduing of the contrary principle of flesh, which hinders our
   obedience, proved, Titus ii. 11, 12; Rom. vi. -- What persons the
   improvement of this doctrine concerns; only true believers, who will
   not abuse it -- How this doctrine of perseverance conduces so eminently
   to the carrying on of gospel obedience in the hearts of these true
   believers -- 1. By removing discouragements -- (1.) Perplexing fears,
   which impair their faith; (2.) Hard thoughts of God, which weaken their
   love: without which two, faith and love, no gospel obedience performed
   -- 2. Unspeakable obligations to live to God hence put upon the souls
   of the saints -- Objections concerning the abuse of this truth to
   presumption and carelessness discussed, examined at large, and removed
   -- The mortification of the flesh, wherein it consists, how it is
   performed -- The influence of the doctrine of the saints' perseverance
   thereinto -- Dread and terror of hell not the means of mortification,
   at large proved by showing quite another means of mortifying the flesh,
   namely, the Spirit of Christ, Rom. viii. 13; applying the cross and
   death of Christ, chap. vi. 5, 6 -- 3. This doctrine is useful to
   promote gospel obedience, in that it tends directly to increase and
   strengthen faith and love both towards God and towards our Lord Jesus
   Christ -- How it strengthens their love to God, namely, by discovering
   his love to them in three eminent properties of it, freedom, constancy,
   fruitfulness -- How it strengthens their love to Jesus Christ, namely,
   by discovering his love to them in two eminent acts of it, his oblation
   and his intercession -- 4. This doctrine conduces, etc., by giving
   gospel obedience its proper place and due order -- 5. By closing in
   with the ends of gospel ordinances, particularly the ministry, one
   eminent end whereof is to perfect the saints, Eph. iv. 12, 13, which is
   done by discovering to them the whole will of God, both precepts on the
   one hand, and promises, exhortations, threatenings, on the other --
   That of the promises more particularly and more largely insisted on.

   That which remains to complete our intendment, as to that part of the
   work which now draws towards a close, is the importment of that
   doctrine so long insisted on (having in some measure vindicated and
   cleared up the truth of it) as to the effectual influence it hath into
   the obedience and consolation of them that are concerned therein; and
   this I shall do in the order that I have named, giving the pre-eminence
   unto their obedience, which, more immediately respecting the glory of
   God and the honour of the gospel, is to be preferred before their
   consolation. Yea, though God should never afford his saints any drop of
   that consolation which we affirm to stream from the truth discussed,
   yet it is honour unspeakable for them that he is pleased to admit them
   and enable them to do him service in this life, and it will be their
   infinite consolation that they have done so, to eternity.

   For the making our way clear to the demonstration of that influence
   which the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints hath into their
   obedience and close walking with God, and so to manifest what weight is
   to be laid upon it on that consideration, I shall give some previous
   observations, which may direct and give us light in our passage, both
   concerning gospel truths, gospel obedience, and gospel motives
   thereunto. I hope it will not be thought amiss if I look a little
   backward, to fortify and clear this part of our progress, there being
   no concernment of our doctrine that is more clamoured [against] by the
   adversaries of it; nor can any respect of it or any truth of God more
   causelessly meet with such entertainment, as I hope will abundantly, in
   the progress of our business, be evinced to the consciences of all who
   know indeed what it is to walk before God in a course of gospel
   obedience, and who have their communion with the Father and his Son
   Jesus Christ. For the first:--

   1. Every truth revealed from God is to be received not only with faith
   and love, but with equal reverence to any that is revealed, though we
   are not able to discern such an immediate tendency unto usefulness in
   our communion with him as in some others we may. The formal reason
   whereinto our faith, love, and reverence unto the word of God is
   resolved is that it is His. Now, this is common to the whole, for he is
   the author of every part and portion alike; and though perhaps we may
   want some part of it at a less fatal, price than some other, yet to
   reject any one tittle or jot of it, as that which is revealed of God,
   is a sufficient demonstration that no one jot or tittle of it is
   received as it ought. Upon whatever this title and inscription is,
   Verbum Jehovæ, there must we stoop and bow down our souls before it,
   and captivate our understandings to the obedience of faith. Whatsoever,
   then, may hereafter be spoken concerning the usefulness of the truth
   under consideration, and the comparative regard which, in respect of
   others, ought on that account to be had thereunto, doth not in the
   least exalt it, as it is in itself, in respect of the faith and
   reverence due thereunto, above arty other truth whatsoever that is in
   Scripture revealed.

   2. That next to the revelation of God, his will and his grace, the
   grand immediate tendency of the whole Scripture is to work them to whom
   the revelation is made into a conformity to himself, and to mould them
   into his own image. "All Scripture," the apostle tells us, 2 Tim. iii.
   16, 17, "is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished
   unto all good works." Hereunto all Scripture tends, and is useful and
   profitable for this end. And the gospel is called "the truth that is
   according to godliness," Titus i. 1; as "the end of the law is charity
   out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned," 1
   Tim. i. 5. That which in respect of the prime Author of it is logos
   Theou, "the word of God," 1 Thess. ii. 13; and in respect of the
   principal matter of it is ho logos ho tou staurou, "the word of the
   cross," 1 Cor. i. 18; in respect of its end and tendency towards us is
   logos eusebeias, "the word," or truth, "that is according to
   godliness." The word is that revealed will of God, which is our
   sanctification, 1 Thess. iv. 3, and the instrument whereby he works our
   holiness, according to that prayer of our Saviour, "Sanctify them by
   thy truth: thy word is truth," John xvii. 17. And that which, when we
   are cast into the mould of our obedience, is in some measure wrought,
   Rom. vi. 17, the substance also or matter being written in our hearts,
   is the grace and holiness promised unto us in the covenant, Jer. xxxi.
   33. And that this is the improvement which ought to he made by
   believers of every gospel truth, or rather, that it hath an efficacy to
   this purpose, the apostle tells us, 2 Cor. iii. 18, "We all, with open
   face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into
   the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
   By apprehensions of the glorious truths discovered in the glass or
   mirror of the gospel, we are changed and moulded into the frame and
   image therein discovered by the power of the Spirit, effectually
   accompanying the word in the dispensation thereof. And unless this be
   done, whatsoever we may pretend, we have not received any truth of the
   gospel as it is in Jesus, in the power of it: Eph. iv. 20-24, "Ye have
   not," saith the apostle, "so learned Christ; if so be that ye have
   heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: that
   ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is
   corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit
   of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is
   created in righteousness and true holiness." Whatsoever men may
   profess, if we have learned the truth as it is in Jesus, it will have
   these effects in us, even universal relinquishment (as to sincerity) of
   all ungodliness, and a thorough change, both as to principles and
   practices, unto holiness and to righteousness, which' the gospel
   teaches us; which if we have not learned, we have not yet learned it
   "as it is in Jesus" Titus ii. 11, "The Mace of God that bringeth
   salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
   godly, in this present world."

   3. Some truths have a more immediate, direct, and effectual tendency to
   the promotion of godliness and gospel obedience than others. This the
   apostle emphatically ascribes as a privilege to that doctrine that
   reveals the love of Christ unto us: 2 Cor. v. 14, "The love of Christ
   constraineth us." Other things effectually persuade, but the love of
   Christ constrains us to live to him. It hath an importunity with it not
   to be denied, an efficacy not to be put off or avoided. And what is in
   the things themselves, as in the love of Christ, that is in its manner,
   in "the word of truth," whereby it is revealed.

   4. That there is, by all that walk with God, great weight to be laid on
   those doctrines of truth which directly and effectually tend to the
   promotion of faith, love, fear, reverence of God, with universal
   holiness in their heart, and ways; this being that whereunto they are
   called, and whereby God is glorified, Jesus Christ and the gospel
   exalted, wherein his kingdom in them consists, on which their own peace
   in their own bosoms, their usefulness unto others in this world, their
   being made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light, do much
   depend. If these things be of weight or moment unto them (as surely
   they are all that is so to believers), then, doubtless, great valuation
   and dear esteem will be entertained of those helps and assistances
   which they have, leading and carrying them on thereunto.

   5. That a judgment of what truths and doctrines are peculiarly
   conducing unto the promotion of piety and godliness is not to be made
   upon the apprehensions and reasonings of men, wrested with a thousand
   corruptions and prejudices, full of darkness and vanity, but according
   to what the Scripture itself holds forth, and the nature of the things
   themselves (that is, the evidence and consequence that is between the
   truth revealed and obedience) doth require. If the testimonies of the
   sons of men must be admitted in this case, to determine what doctrine
   is according to godliness, the cry and noise of them will be found so
   various, discrepant, confused, and directly contradictory to itself,
   that none will ever thereby be led to establishment. Then Papists will
   cry out for their merits, penance, vows, purgatory; the Socinians,
   familists, formalists, all contend, upon the foundation of their own
   persuasions, as to the tendency to godliness of their abominations.
   That doctrine Which hath no other proof of its truth and worth but that
   men, some men, profess it tends to godliness and holiness of
   conversation, I dare say is a lie and vanity, and did never promote any
   thing but vain, legal, superstitious, counterfeit holiness. Indeed,
   upon a supposition of its truth, it is of concernment, for the
   advancement of any doctrine in the esteem and opinion of the saints, to
   manifest that it leads to godliness; but to prove it to be true because
   men who perhaps never knew any thing beyond formal, legal, pharisaical
   holiness nit their days, say it tends to the promotion of holiness, is
   but to obtrude our conceptions upon others that are no way moulded into
   the frame of them. "That the embracement of such a truth will further
   us in our obedience and walking with God, therefore value and prize
   it," is good arguing; but, "That such a doctrine will further us in a
   way of godliness, therefore it is a truth," when we may be mistaken
   both in godliness itself and in the motives to it and furtherances of
   it, is but a presumption. To commend, then, the truth which we have at
   large otherwise confirmed to the hearts and consciences of the saints
   of God, and to lay a foundation for the full removal of those vain and
   weak exceptions which, on this account, are laid against it, I shall
   manifest what influences it hath into their obedience, and with what
   eminent efficacy it prevails upon their souls to "perfect holiness in
   the fear of God." For the more clear declaration whereof I shall give
   the reader the sum of it, under the ensuing considerations concerning
   gospel obedience, and the motives that are proper thereunto.

   That which I call gospel obedience, wherein the saints of God are
   furthered by the belief of the truth we have in hand, is variously
   expressed in the Scripture. It may in general be described to be a
   voluntary orderly subjection to the whole will of God. I call it
   obedience in reference unto the will of God, which is the rule and
   pattern of it, and whereunto it is in a regular subjection. The
   psalmist expresses it to the full, both as to the root and fruit: Ps.
   xl. 8, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
   heart." The law in the heart gives us to do, and to delight in doing,
   the will of God. Peter calls it being "holy in all manner of
   conversation," 1 Pet. i. 14, 15; Paul, a "cleansing of ourselves from
   all filthiness of the flesh and spirit in the fear of God," 2 Cor. vii.
   1; or, as it is more eminently described, Rom. xii. 1, 2, in that
   pathetical exhortation of the apostle thereunto, "I beseech you,
   brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
   And be not conformed unto this world: but be ye transformed by the
   renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
   acceptable, and perfect, will of God," as he had formerly at large
   described it in the sixth chapter of that epistle throughout. And I
   call it gospel obedience, not that it differs in substance, as to the
   matter of it, from that required by the law, which enjoins us to "love
   the Lord our God with all our heart," but that it moves upon principles
   and is carried on unto ends revealed only in the gospel.

   In reference to our design, there are these four things considerable in
   it:-- First, The nature of it; Secondly, The principle in us from
   whence it proceeds; Thirdly, The motives that are proper to the
   carrying it on, the cherishing and increasing of it in them in whom it
   is; Fourthly, The persons who are to be moved and provoked to a
   progress therein.

   By a brief consideration of these things, we shall make way for what we
   have undertaken, -- namely, to manifest the efficacy of the doctrine we
   have insisted on for the promotion of this gospel obedience, it being
   accused and charged with the clean contrary tendency; whereof, God
   assisting, we shall free and discharge it in the progress of this
   discourse.

   First, In the nature of it, I shall consider only these two things:--
   1. The matter or substance of it; what it is as it were composed of,
   and wherein it doth consist. 2. The form or manner of its performance,
   whence it receives its distinct being as such.

   1. The matter or substance of it contains those things or duties to God
   wherein it doth consist. Now, it consisting, as I said before, in
   conformity and submission to the will, that is, the commanding revealed
   will, of God, the matter of it must lie in the performance of all those
   things, and only those things, which God requireth of believers in
   walking before him; I say, all those things that God commandeth, with
   an equal respect to all his precepts. The authority of God, the
   commander and lawgiver, is the same in every command; and therefore was
   the curse denounced upon "every one that continued not in all things
   written in the law to do them;" and the apostle tells us that in the
   transgression of any one precept there is included the transgression of
   the whole law, because the authority of the lawgiver, both in the one
   and the other, is despised: James ii. 10, 11, "Whosoever shall keep the
   whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he
   that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill." And I say,
   it is only to the command, for "in vain do men worship him, teaching
   for doctrines the commandments of men." The most stupendous endeavours
   of men, the most laborious drudgery of their souls, in duties not
   commanded, are so far from obedience that they are as high rebellions
   against God as they can possibly engage themselves into.

   I might rather distinguish the matter or substance of this obedience
   into the internal elicit act of our souls, in faith, love, and the like
   acts of moral and everlasting obedience, -- which are naturally,
   necessarily, and indispensably, required in us upon the account of the
   first commandment, and the natural subjection wherein we stand unto God
   as his creatures, improved and enlarged by the new obligation put upon
   us in being his redeemed ones (wherein, indeed, the main of our
   obedience doth consist), -- and the outward instituted duties of
   religion, which God hath appointed for those former acts of obedience
   to be exercised in and exerted by; but the former description of it,
   with the intimation of its universality, may suffice.

   2. The formality, if I may so speak, of this obedience, or that which
   makes the performance of duties commanded to be obedience, consists in
   these three things:--

   (1.) The principle that begins it and sets it on work immediately in
   us, and that is faith: "Without faith it is impossible to please God,"
   Heb. xi. 6. Could a man do all that is commanded, yet if he did it not
   in faith, it would be of no value. Hence it is called "The obedience of
   faith," Rom. i. 5; not "For obedience to the faith," but [202] "The
   obedience of faith," which faith bringeth forth. Therefore are
   believers called "obedient children," 1 Pet. i. 14, and we are said to
   "purify our souls in obeying the truth," verse 22. "Christ dwells in
   our hearts by faith," and "without him we can do nothing," John xv. 5.
   All that we do is no better, seeing we can no way "draw near unto God
   with a trim heart" but "in full assurance of faith," Heb. x. 22.

   (2.) The manner of doing it, which consists in a due spiritual regard
   to the will of God in those ways whereby he calls men out to this
   obedience, -- namely, in his precepts and promises. There is no
   obedience unto God but that which moves according to his direction; it
   must in every motion eye his command on the one hand, and his promise,
   whether of assistance for it or acceptance in it, on the other. Saith
   David, "I have respect unto all thy commandments," Ps. cxix. 6; and
   saith the apostle, "Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves
   from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the
   fear of God," 2 Cor. vii. 1.

   (3.) The principal end of it, which is the glory of God as a rewarder;
   for "he that cometh unto God must believe that he is, and that he is a
   rewarder of them that diligently seek him," Heb. xi. 6. The end of
   legal obedience was the glory of God as a rewarder according to merit
   in strict justice. The end of gospel obedience is the glory of God as a
   rewarder according to bounty, free grace, and mercy; under which
   consideration, neither needs the obedience rewardable to be
   commensurate to the reward, nor is the reward procured by that
   obedience. If it were, then it were of works, and not of grace, as the
   apostle tells us, Rom. iv. 4. So that the end of our obedience is to
   exalt God as a rewarder; yet that being as a rewarder of grace and
   bounty, the use of our obedience is not to procure that reward (for
   that were to work, and to have a reward reckoned to us of debt, and not
   of grace), but only to make the Lord gracious, and to exalt him in our
   present subjection and in his future gift of grace, in nature of a
   free, bounteous reward. This, I say, is that, gospel obedience which,
   by the doctrine insisted on, is promoted in the souls of believers.

   Secondly, This being so, as was said, the gospel obedience whereof we
   speak, it is evident what principle it proceedeth from. Whereas there
   are two contrary principles in every regenerate man, as shall more
   fully afterward be declared, called in the Scripture "flesh and Spirit,
   the old and new man, indwelling sin and grace," which have both of them
   their seats and places in all and the same faculties of the soul, it is
   most evident that this obedience flows solely and merely from the
   latter principle, the Spirit, the new or inner man, the new creature
   which is wrought in believers. The strengthening and heightening of
   this principle the Holy Ghost lays at the bottom of the renewal and
   increase of gospel obedience. Eph. iii. 16-19, "I pray," saith the
   apostle, "that God would grant you, according to the riches of his
   glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
   that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted
   and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is
   the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of
   Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the
   fullness of God." Their "strengthening with might by the Spirit in the
   inner man" is the foundation of their acting of and increasing in
   faith, love, knowledge, and assurance unto all the fullness of God. It
   is the "new man, which after God is created in righteousness and tree
   holiness," that carries men out unto all acceptable obedience, as chap.
   iv. 24, of the same epistle. Look, whatsoever influences the other
   principle of the flesh hath into our obedience, so far it is defiled:
   for "that which is born of the flesh is flesh," John iii. 6, and all
   the fruits of it are abominable; hence are all the pollutions that
   cleave to our holy things. Yea, if at any time poor and mere selfish
   considerations do put men upon duties of obedience and abstaining from
   sin, as fear of vengeance and destruction, and the like (which is made
   almost the only motive to obedience by the doctrine of the saints'
   apostasy), their obedience in doing or abstaining is but as their fear
   of the Lord who were taught it by lions, and abominable unto him, 2
   Kings xvii. 25, 32-34. This, then, being the nature of gospel
   obedience, and this the principle from whence it flows, it is evident,
   --

   Thirdly, What are those motives which are suited to the promotion and
   carrying of it on in the hearts of believers; and what doctrines have
   an eminent and singular tendency thereunto is also to be considered.
   Now, these must all of them be such as are suited to the cherishing of
   that principle of the new or inner man in the heart, to the nourishing
   and strengthening of the new creature; such as are apt to ingenerate
   faith and love in the heart unto God; such as reveal and discover those
   things in his nature, mind, and will, which are apt to endear and draw
   out the heart to him in communion. Discouraging, perplexing doctrines
   do but ill manure the soil from whence the fruits of obedience are to
   spring and grow. Look, then, I say, whatsoever gospel truth is of
   eminent usefulness to warm, foment, stir up, and quicken, the principle
   of grace in the heart, to draw out, increase, and cherish faith and
   love, that doctrine lies in a direct, immediate tendency to the
   promotion of holiness, godliness, and gospel obedience. Yea, and
   whereas to the carrying on of that course of obedience, it is necessary
   that the contrary principle unto it, which we mentioned before, be
   daily subdued, brought under, crucified, and mortified; there are no
   doctrines whatsoever that are of such and so direct and eminent a
   serviceableness to that end and purpose as those which inwrap such
   discoveries of God and his goodwill in Christ as are fitted for the
   improvement also of the principle of grace in us. Hence the work of
   mortification in the Scripture is everywhere assigned peculiarly to the
   cross and death of Christ, -- his love manifested therein, and his
   Spirit flowing therefrom. The doctrine of the law, indeed, humbles the
   soul for Christ; but it is the doctrine of the gospel that humbles the
   soul in Christ. [203] It is "the grace of God that hath appeared, that
   teacheth us effectually to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and
   to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world," Titus
   ii. 11, 12. He that will but with a little heed read chap. vi. to the
   Romans will know from whence mortification flows: which truly, by the
   way, makes me admire at the extreme darkness and blindness of some poor
   men who have of late undertaken to give directions for devotion and
   walking with God; who, indeed, suitably to the most of the rest of
   their discourses, -- all manifesting an "ignorance of the righteousness
   of God," Rom. x. 4, and a zealous endeavour to establish their own, --
   coming to propose ways and means for the mortifying of any sin or lust,
   tell you stories of biting the tongue, thrusting needles under the
   nails, with such like trash as might have befitted popish devotions
   five hundred years ago. Were not men utterly ignorant what it is to
   "know the Lord Jesus Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and the
   fellowship of his sufferings, and to be made conformable to his death,"
   they could never feed on such husks themselves, nor make provision of
   them for those whose good they pretend to seek, Phil. iii. 10; Gal. vi.
   14. Unto what hath been spoken add, --

   Fourthly, Who are the persons that are to be provoked to holiness and
   godliness by the doctrine insisted on. Now, they are such as do believe
   it, and are concerned in it. We say, the truth under consideration is
   of an excellent usefulness to further gospel obedience in the hearts of
   believers and saints of God, who are taught of God not to turn the
   doctrine of grace into wantonness. What use, or abuse rather, men of
   corrupt minds and carnal principles, who stumble at Jesus Christ, and
   abuse the whole doctrine of the gospel by their prejudices and
   presumptions, will make of it, we know not, nor are solicitous. "If the
   gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost," 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4. It is
   sufficient that the food be good and wholesome for them for whom it is
   provided. If some will come and steal it that have no right to it, and
   it prove, through their own distempers, gravel in their mouths or
   poison in their bowels, they must blame themselves and their own
   wormwood lusts, and not the doctrine which they do receive, 2 Cor. ii.
   16. It is provided for them that fear God, and love the Lord Jesus
   Christ in sincerity, not for dogs, swine, -- unbelievers. We shall not
   marvel if they trample on this pearl, and rend them that bring it. To
   such as these, then, I say, the doctrine of the perseverance of the
   saints, or the stability or unchangeableness of the love of God unto
   believers, and of their continuation in faith and obedience, is full of
   exceeding effectual motives and provocations unto holiness, in all
   manner of gospel obedience and holy conversation, exceedingly
   advantaging the souls of men in a course thereof. Now, the influence it
   hath into the obedience of the saints floweth from it upon a twofold
   account:-- By removing all discouragements whatsoever that are apt
   either to turn them aside from their obedience, or to render their
   obedience servile, slavish, or unacceptable to God; it sets them,
   through Christ, at perfect liberty thereunto. [And] by, putting
   unconquerable and indissoluble obligations upon them to live unto God
   and to the praise of his glorious grace; and evidently draws them forth
   unto the obedience required.

   1. It removeth and taketh out of the way all discouragements
   whatsoever, all things which are apt to interpose to the weakening of
   their faith in God or their love to God; which, as hath been said, are
   at the bottom of all obedience and holiness that is acceptable to God
   in Christ. Now, these may all be referred unto two heads:-- (1.) Of
   perplexing, anxious fears, which are apt to impair and weaken the faith
   of the saints. (2.) Of hard thoughts of God, which assault and shake
   their love.

   (1.) That slavish, perplexing, troublesome fears are contrary to the
   free and ingenuous state of children, whereunto the saints are
   admitted, and (however sometimes, yea, oftentimes, they are at the
   bottom, and are the occasion of burdensome, servile, and superstitious
   obedience) impairers of their faith, I suppose I need not labour to
   prove. That kind of fear whereof we speak (of which more afterward) is
   the greatest traitor that lurks in the soul. To "fear the Lord and his
   goodness" is the soul's keeper, Hos. iii. 5; but this servile,
   perplexing fear is the betrayer of it in all its ways, and that which
   sours all its duties, -- a thing which the Lord sets himself against,
   in rebukes, reproofs, dehortations, as much as any failing and
   miscarriage in his saints whatever. It is the opposite of faith; hence
   the "fearful and unbelieving" are put together in their exclusion from
   the New Jerusalem, Rev. xx. 8. It is that which is direct contrary to
   that which the apostle adviseth the saints unto, Heb. x. 19-22. It is
   that which mixeth faith with staggering, Rom. iv. 20, prayer with
   wavering, making it ineffectual, James i. 6, 7.

   Let us now suppose a man to have attained some assurance of the love of
   God, and, "justified by faith," to have "peace with him" [204] (which,
   as to his present condition, the adversaries of the doctrine of
   perseverance acknowledge that he may attain, though how, upon their
   principles, I understand not); consider a little how he can safeguard
   his peace for a moment, and deliver himself from perplexing thoughts
   and fears, renouncing any interest in the engagement of the love and
   faithfulness of God for his preservation, lie may say within himself,
   "I am for the present in some good state and condition; but were not
   the angels so that are now devils in hell? were not they in a far
   better and more excellent state than I am? and yet they are now shut up
   under chains of everlasting darkness to the judgment of the great day.
   Adam in paradise had no lust within him to tempt and seduce him, no
   world under the curse to entangle and provoke him, and yet, being in
   that honour, he had no understanding, he abode not,' but became like
   the beasts that perish.' Was it not in their power to persevere in that
   condition if they would? Did they want any means that were useful
   thereunto? And what hope is there left to me, in whom there dwelleth no
   good thing, who am sold under' the power of sin,' [205] and encompassed
   with a world of temptations, that I shall endure unto the end? I see
   thousands before mine eyes, partakers of the same heavenly calling with
   myself, of the same grace in Jesus Christ, every day falling into
   irrevocable perdition. There is not any promise of God that! should be
   preserved, no promise that I shall never depart from him, no prayer of
   Christ that my faith may not fail, but I am rolled upon mine own hands;
   and what will be the end of this whole undertaking of mine in the ways
   of God I know not." Let, I say, a man be exercised with such thoughts
   as these, and then try if any thing under heaven can bring his soul to
   any possible composure, until, it be "cast into the mould of that
   doctrine which hath been delivered." But of this more directly
   afterward, when we come to treat of the consolation which from the
   breasts of it doth flow.

   (2.) It is exceedingly suited to the deliverance of the souls of the
   saints from all such hard thoughts of God as are apt to impair and
   weaken their love towards him and delight in him; so setting the two
   principles of all their obedience, faith and love, at liberty, and free
   from their entanglements, to act in the duties they are called unto. He
   that had hard thoughts of his absent lord as an austere man, though he
   was not excused in his disobedience by it, yet was evidently
   discouraged as to his obedience. When men shall be taught that God
   takes no more care of his children in his family, but that the devil
   may enter in among them and take them away, making them children of
   hell, when he might with the greatest advantage of glory and honour to
   himself imaginable prevent it; that the Lord Jesus Christ, "the great
   shepherd of the sheep," takes no more care of his flock and fold, but
   that the lion, bears, and wolves, may enter in, and make havoc, and
   spoil at their pleasure; -- may they not think that God is little
   concerned in the salvation of his, and that all that which is so
   gloriously expressed of his peculiar and special love carries nothing
   but an empty noise, the burden of their preservation being thrown
   solely upon their own shoulders? And are not such thoughts fit only to
   cast water upon their flames of love to God, and insensibly to weaken
   that delight which they ought always to take in the riches of his grace
   and love? Is there any thing possible more endearing to the heart of a
   creature than to hear such a testimony as that, Zeph. iii. 17,
   concerning the stability of the love of God, and its excellency, "The
   Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will
   rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over
   thee with singing? God's resting in his love towards his saints fixes
   their souls in their love to him.

   2. It puts high and unspeakable obligations on the saints to live to
   God, and to "perfect holiness in the fear of God." Saints we suppose to
   have their birth from above, to be begotten of the will of God, through
   the immortal seed of the word, and to be quickened with a noble,
   child-like ingenuity, befitting the family of God; neither is there any
   thing more injurious to the work of God's grace than to suppose that
   those whom God calls "children, friends, heirs of heaven and glory, his
   crown, his diadem, brethren of his only Son," are to be dealt withal,
   or that God deals with them, as if they were wholly acted by a servile,
   slavish principle, and were wholly under the power of such an unworthy
   disposition.

   There are two things usually spoken to the prejudice and disadvantage
   of the truth we have under consideration, much insisted on by Mr
   Goodwin, chap. ix.; as, --

   (1.) "That a persuasion of the certain continuance of the love of God
   to any one is a ready way to make them careless, negligent, and to give
   up themselves to all manner of abominations."

   But what vipers, snakes, and adders, do such men suppose the saints of
   God to be, theft their new nature, their heavenly principles (for what
   the flesh in them is prone unto we now consider not), should conclude
   that it is good to sin "that grace may abound;" that because God "loves
   them with an everlasting love," therefore they will hate him with a
   perpetual hatred; that because he will assuredly give them "grace to
   serve him with reverence and godly fear," therefore they will despise
   him and trample on all his goodness; that because he will "never
   forsake them," they will no more abide with him What is in the inner
   man, what is in the new creature, what is in the nature of any grace
   wherewith they are endowed, that is apt or inclinable to make such
   hellish conclusions? If we hear of any such thing among the sons of
   men, -- if we see a child or a servant resolving to be profligate,
   wicked, stubborn, prodigal, because his father or master is kind,
   loving, and will not disinherit him or put him away, -- we look upon
   him as a monster in nature, and think that it would be good service to
   the interest of mankind to take him off from the face of earth; and yet
   such monsters are all the saints of God supposed to be, who, if their
   Father once give them the least assurance of the continuance of his
   love, they presently resolve to do him all the dishonour, despite, and
   mischief they can! I appeal to all the experience of all the saints in
   the world whether, if any such thought at any time arise in them, that
   they may "continue in sin because grace hath abounded," that they may
   live in all filth and folly because God hath promised never to forsake
   them nor turn away his love from them, they do not look upon it as a
   hellish abuse of the love of God, which they labour to crucify no less
   than any other work of the flesh whatsoever. Presuppose, indeed, the
   saints of God to be dogs and swine, wholly sensual and unregenerate,
   that is, no saints, and our doctrine to be such, that God will love
   them and save them continuing in that state wherein they are, and you
   make a bed for iniquity to stretch itself upon; but suppose that we
   teach that the "wrath of God" will certainly come upon the "children of
   disobedience," that "he that believeth not shall be damned," and that
   God will keep his own "by his power through faith unto salvation," and
   that, in and by the use of means, they shall certainly be preserved to
   the end, and the mouth of iniquity will be stopped.

   (2.) They say, "It takes away that strong curb and bridle which ought
   to be kept in the mouth of the flesh, to keep it from running headlong
   into sin and folly, -- namely, the fear of hell and punishment, which
   alone hath an influence upon it to bring it to subjection and under
   obedience."

   But now, if there be nothing in the world that is of use for the
   mortification and crucifying of the flesh and the lusts thereof but it
   receives improvement by this doctrine, this crimination must of
   necessity vanish into nothing.

   (1.) Then, it tells us that the flesh and all the deeds thereof are to
   be crucified and slain, God having ordained good works for us to walk
   in; that for the works of the flesh, the wrath of God cometh upon the
   children of disobedience; and if any say, "Let us continue in sin,
   because we are not under the law, or the condemning power of it for
   sin, but under grace," it cries out, "God forbid!" Rom. vi. 14, 15, and
   saith, this is argument enough and proof sufficient that sin shall not
   have dominion over us, "because we are not under the law, but under
   grace." It tells you, also, that there is a twofold fear of hell and
   punishment of sin; -- first, Of anxiety and doubtfulness in respect of
   the end; secondly, Of care and diligence that respecteth the means.

   And for the first, it saith that this is the portion of very many of
   the saints of God, of some all their days. Though they are so, yet they
   know not that they are so; and therefore are under anxious and doubtful
   fears of hell and punishment, notwithstanding that they are in the arms
   of their Father, from whence, indeed, they shall not be cast down; --
   as a man bound with chains on the top of a tower cannot but fear, and
   yet he cannot fall. He cannot fall, because he is fast bound with
   strong chains; he cannot but fear, because he cannot actually and
   clearly consider oftentimes the means of his preservation.

   And for the latter, a fear of the ways and means leading to punishment,
   as such, that continues upon all the saints of God in this life;
   neither is there any thing in this doctrine that is suited to a removal
   thereof. And this, it says, is more, much more of use for the
   mortification of the flesh than the former.

   (2.) It says that the great and principal means of mortification of the
   flesh is not fear of hell and punishment, but the Spirit of Christ, as
   the apostle tells us, Rom. viii. 13, "If ye through the Spirit do
   mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." It is the Spirit of
   Christ alone that is able to do this great work. We know what bondage
   and religious drudgery some have put themselves unto upon this account,
   and yet could never in their lives attain to the mortification of any
   one sin. It is the Spirit of Christ alone that hath sovereign power in
   our souls of killing and making alive. As no man quickeneth his own
   soul, so no man upon any consideration whatsoever, or by the power of
   any threatenings of the law, can kill his own sin. There was never any
   one sin truly mortified by the law or the threatening of it. All that
   the law can do of itself is but to entangle sin, and thereby to
   irritate and provoke it, like a bull in a net, or a beast led to the
   slaughter. It is the Spirit of Christ in the gospel that cuts its
   throat and destroys it. Now, this doctrine was never in the least
   charged with denying the Spirit of God to believers; which whilst it
   doth grant and maintain in a way of opposition to that late opinion
   which advanceth itself against it, it maintains the mortification of
   the flesh and the lusts thereof upon the only true and unshaken
   foundation.

   (3.) It tells you that the great means whereby the Spirit of Christ
   worketh the mortification of the flesh and the lusts thereof is the
   application of the cross of Christ, and his death and love therein,
   unto the soul, and says that those vain endeavours which some promote
   and encourage for the mortification of sin, consisting, for the most
   part, in slavish, bodily exercises, are to be bewailed with tears of
   blood as abominations that seduce poor souls from the cross of Christ;
   for it says this work is only truly and in an acceptable manner
   performed when we are "planted into the likeness of the death of
   Christ, having our old man crucified with him, and the body of sin
   destroyed," Rom. vi. 5, 6, and thereupon by faith "reckoning ourselves
   dead unto sin, but alive unto God," verse 11. It is done only by
   "knowing the fellowship of the sufferings of Christ, and being made
   conformable to his death," Phil. iii. 10. "By the cross of Christ is
   the world crucified unto us, and we unto the world," Gal. vi. 14. The
   Spirit brings home the power of the cross of Christ to the soul for the
   accomplishing of this work, and without it it will not be done.
   Moreover, it says that, by the way of motive to this duty, there is
   nothing comes with that efficacy upon the soul as the love of Christ in
   his death; as the apostle assures us, 2 Cor. v. 14, 15, "For the love
   of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for
   all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live
   should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
   them, and rose again." Now, it was never laid to the charge of this
   doctrine that it took off from the virtue of the death and cross of
   Christ, but rather, on the contrary, though falsely, that it ascribed
   too much thereunto; so that, these importune exceptions
   notwithstanding, the doctrine in hand doth not only main-rain its own
   innocency as to any tendency unto looseness, but also manifestly
   declareth its own usefulness to all ends and purposes of gospel
   obedience whatsoever: for, --

   (4.) It stirs up, provokes, and draws out into action, every thing that
   is free, noble, ingenuous, filial, and of a heavenly descent, in the
   saints of God. Thus, --

   [1.] It strengthens their faith in God and in Jesus Christ; which is
   the bottom of all acceptable obedience whatsoever, all that which
   proceedeth from any other root being but a product of labouring in the
   fire, which in the end will consume both root and branch. That which
   prevails upon and draws out the soul to faith and believing, I mean as
   it is peculiar to the gospel and justifying, -- that is, as it is in
   God as a Father, and in the Lord Christ as a Mediator, -- is the
   discovery of the good-will of God to the soul in Christ, and his design
   to advance his glory thereby. I speak not of the formal cause of faith
   in general, but of the peculiar motive to faith and believing in the
   sense before mentioned. So our Saviour giving the command in general to
   his disciples, John xiv. 1, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me," in
   the whole ensuing chapter provokes them to it with gracious discoveries
   of the good-will of God, -- his Father's and his own good-will towards
   them. And, indeed, propose what other considerations ye will, provoke
   the soul by all the fear and dread of hell, and the most dismal
   representation of the wrath to come, until it be convinced of this, it
   will never take one step towards God in Christ. Now, "our adversaries
   themselves being judges," the doctrine we have had under consideration
   abounds above all others with the discoveries of the good-will and
   kindness of God to poor sinners; yea, the great crime that is laid to
   the charge of it is that it extends it too far. It doth not only assert
   that God freely "begins the good work in them," but that he will also
   powerfully "perfect it to the day of Jesus Christ." It assures the
   souls of the poor saints of God that he who "looked upon them in their
   blood, and said unto them Live, when no eye pitied them, who quickened
   them when they were dead in trespasses and in sins, begetting them of
   his own will by the word of truth, that they should be a kind of
   first-fruits to himself, washing them in the blood of his Son," and
   delivering them from the old tyrant Satan, -- that he will not now
   leave them to themselves and to the counsel of their own hands, to
   stand or fall according as they shall of themselves and by themselves
   be able to withstand opposition and seduction; but that he will keep
   them in his own hand, giving them such constant supplies of his grace
   and Spirit as that, in the rise of means, they shall wait upon him to
   the end; and that howsoever or whensoever, by the power of temptation
   and surprisals of corruptions, they are carried aside from him, he will
   "heal their backslidings, and love them freely," and though they change
   every day, yet "he changeth not, and therefore they are not consumed."
   And hereby, I say, it confirms and strengthens their faith in God as a
   Father in Jesus Christ, taking everlasting care of them.

   [2.] Of their love there is the same reason. God's love to us is of his
   free grace; he loves us because so it seems good to him. Our love to
   him is purely ingenerated by his love to us, and carried on and
   increased by farther revelations of his desirableness and excellency to
   our souls: "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved
   us" first. There is no creature in the least guilty of sin that can put
   forth any acceptable act of love towards God, but what is purely drawn
   out upon the apprehension of his love and loveliness in his grace and
   mercy. A man, I confess, may love God when he hath no sense of his love
   to him in particular; but it must all be built upon an apprehension of
   his love to sinners, though he may come short in the application. It is
   the "terror of the Lord" that causes us to "persuade" others, but it is
   the "love of Christ that constraineth us" to live to him. She loved
   much to whom much was forgiven. Look, then, the more abundant
   discoveries are made of the loveliness and desirableness [of God] in
   the riches of his grace, the more effectual is the sole and only motive
   we have to love him with that filial, chaste, holy love, that he
   requires.

   For the love of God to his saints, our doctrine of their perseverance
   sets it forth with the greatest advantage for the endearment of their
   souls, to draw out their streams of love to God; especially doth it
   give it its glory in three things:--

   1st. In its freedom. It sets forth the love of God to his saints as
   that which they have no way in the least deserved, as hath been
   manifested from Isa. xlviii. 8, 9, 11, liv. 9, 10. As he "first loved
   them, not because they were better than others, being by nature
   children of wrath, and lying in their blood, when he said to them Live,
   quickening them when they were dead in trespasses and sins;" so he doth
   not continue his love to them, nor purpose so to do, because he
   foresees that they will so and so walk with him in holiness and
   uprightness (for he foresees no such thing in them, but what he himself
   purposeth effectually to work upon the account of his loving them), but
   he resolves to do it merely upon the account of his own grace. He
   neither resolves to continue his love to them on condition that they be
   so and so holy, at random, and with uncertainty of the event, but
   freely, that they may and shall be so. And this is the glory of love,
   the most orient pearl in the crown of it, Eph. i. 4. It is not
   mercenary, nor self-ended, nor deserved; but, as a spring and fountain,
   freely vents and pours out itself upon its own account. And what
   ingenuous, truly noble, heavenly-descended heart can hold out against
   the power of this love? It is effectually constraining to all manner of
   suitable returns. Let the soul but put itself into the actual
   contemplation of the love of God, as it lies represented in this
   property of it, every way free, undeserved, the great love of God to a
   poor worm, a sinner, a nothing, and it cannot but he wrought to a
   serious admiration of it, and delight in it, and be pained and
   straitened, until it make stone suitable returns of love and obedience
   unto God; if not, it may well doubt it never tasted of that love or
   enjoyed any fruits of it.

   2dly. It gives the love of God the glory of its constancy and
   unchangeableness. This is another star of an eminent magnitude in the
   heaven of love. It is not a fading, a wavering, an altering thing, but
   abides for ever; God "rests in his love," Zeph. iii. 17. It is a great
   thing, indeed, to apprehend that the great God should fix his love upon
   a poor creature, but add hereunto that he may love them one day and
   hate them the next, embrace them one hour and the next cast them into
   hell, one day rejoicing over them with joy, another rejoicing to
   destroy them; as it is dishonourable to God, and derogatory to all his
   divine excellencies and perfections, so, in particular, it clotheth his
   love with the most uncomely and undesirable garment that ever was put
   upon the affections of the meanest worm of the earth. What can ye say
   more contemptible of a man, more to his dishonour among all wise and
   knowing men, or that shall, render his respects and affections more
   undesirable, than to say, "He is free of his love, indeed, but he
   abides not in it. What a world of examples have we of those who have
   been in his bosom and have again been cast out!" Though among men
   something may be pretended in excuse of this, with respect unto their
   ignorance, the shortness of their foresight, disability to discern
   between things and appearances, yet in respect of God, "before whom all
   things are open and naked," in whose eye all incidences and events lie
   as clearly stated as things that are already past and gone, what can be
   said of such a vain supposal for the vindication of his glory? It is
   said that "men change from what they were when God loved them, and
   therefore his love changeth also." But who first made them fit to be
   beloved? did not the Lord? Do they make themselves differ from others?
   On what account did he do it? was it not merely on the account of his
   own grace? Can he not as well preserve them in a state of being beloved
   as put them into it? And if he determined that he would not preserve
   them in that condition, why did he set his love upon them when himself
   knew that he would not continue it to them? Was it only to give his
   love the dishonour of a change? I say, then, the doctrine contended for
   gives the love of God the glory of its immutability, asserts it to be
   like himself, unchangeable, -- that there is not, indeed, in itself the
   "least shadow of turning." It may be eclipsed and obscured, as to its
   beams and influences, for a season; but changed, turned away, it cannot
   be. And this consideration of it renders it to the souls of the saints
   inestimably precious. The very thought of it, considering that nothing
   else could possibly save or preserve them, is marrow to their bones and
   health to their souls, and makes them cry out to all that is within
   them to love the Lord and to live unto him.

   3dly. It gives it the glory of its fruitfulness. A barren love is upon
   the matter no love. Love that hath no breasts, no bowels, that pities
   not, that assists not, deserves not that heavenly name. Will ye say she
   is a tender, loving, mother who can look on a languishing, perishing
   child, yea, see a ravenous beast, whom yet she could easily drive away,
   take it out of her arms and devour it before her face, and not put
   forth her strength for its assistance or deliverance? or will ye say
   she is a tiger, and a monster in nature? And shall we feign such a love
   in God towards his children (which is such that all the bowels of a
   tender parent to an only child are but as a drop to the ocean in
   comparison of it) as that he looks on whilst they languish and perish,
   fall, sink, and die away into everlasting calamity? yea, that
   notwithstanding it he will suffer the roaring lion to come and snatch
   them away out of his arms, and devour them before his face; that he
   will look upon them sinking into eternal separation from him, and such
   destruction as that it had been infinitely better for them never to
   have been born, without putting forth his power and the efficacy of his
   grace for their preservation? "O foolish people and unwise! shall we
   thus requite the Lord" as to render him so hard a Master, so cruel a
   Father to his tender ones, the lambs of his Son, washed in his blood,
   quickened by his Spirit, owned by him, smiled on, embraced ten thousand
   times, as to suffer them so to be taken out of his hands? Is there
   nothing in his love to cause his "bowels to move and his repentings to
   be kindled together" towards a poor dying child, that surely departeth
   not without some sad looks towards his Father? "Nemo repente fit
   turpissimus." Is this the kindness which he exalteth above the love of
   a woman to her sucking child, of a mother to the fruit of her womb? Oh
   that men should dare thus foolishly to charge the Almighty, to ascribe
   such a barren, fruitless love to him who is love, towards his children,
   who are as the apple of his eye, his dear and tender ones, as would be
   a perpetual blot and stain to any earthly parent to have righteously
   ascribed to him! I say, then, our doctrine gives the love of God the
   glory of its fruitfulness. It asserts it to be such a fountain-love as
   from whence continually streams of grace, kindness, mercy, and
   refreshment do flow: "Because he loveth us with everlasting love,
   therefore with loving-kindness he draweth us," Jer. xxxi. 3. From that
   love proceed continual supplies of the Spirit and grace by which those
   of whom it is said they "abide" are preserved lovely and fit by him to
   be beloved. It tells us that because God "loveth his people," therefore
   are they "in his hand," Deut. xxxiii. 3. It declares it to be such a
   love as is the womb of all mercy, whence pardon, healing, recovery from
   wounds, sicknesses, and dying pangs, do continually flow; a love upon
   the account whereof the persons loved may make conclusion that they
   shall lack nothing, Ps. xxiii. 1; a love whose fruitfulness is
   subservient to its own constancy, preserving the saints such as he may
   rest in it unchangeably, Rom. viii. 29, 30; a love whereby God "sings
   to his vineyard, watches over it, and waters it every moment," Isa.
   xxvii. 2, 3. And now, what flint almost in the rock of stone would not
   be softened and dissolved by this love? When we shall think that it is
   from the love of God that our wasted portion hath been so often
   renewed, that our dying graces have been so often quickened, our
   dreadful backslidings so often healed, our breaches and decays so often
   repaired, and the pardon of our innumerable transgressions so often
   sealed, unless we suck the breasts of tigers, and have nothing in us
   but the nature of wolves and unclean, beasts, can we hold out against
   the sweet, gracious, powerful, effectual influence that it will have
   upon our souls? Thus, I say, doth the doctrine which we have in hand
   set out the love of God unto us in its eminent endearing properties,
   wherein, he being embraced through Christ, a foundation is laid, and
   eminent promotion given unto the holiness and obedience which he
   requireth of us.

   This doctrine renders Jesus Christ lovely to our souls, to the souls of
   believers. It represents him to them as the "standard-bearer [206] to
   ten thousand," as one "altogether lovely," as exceeding desirable in
   the work of his oblation, and lovely and amiable in the work of his
   intercession, as hath been manifested.

   1st. [As for his oblation], it imports him as one who, in his death,
   hath made an end of the controversy between God and our souls, Dan. ix.
   24, becoming "our peace," Eph. ii. 14, "having obtained for us eternal
   redemption," Heb. ix. 12; that he hath not suffered all that sorrow,
   anguish, pain, torment, dereliction, whereunto for our sakes he was
   given up, and willingly exposed himself, for an uncertain end, not
   fighting in his death as one beating the air, nor leaving his work in
   the dust, to be trampled on or taken up as it seems good to us, in our
   polluted, dark, dead estate of nature; but hath filled it with such
   immortal seed, that of itself, by itself, and its own unconquerable
   efficacy, it bath sprung up to the bringing forth of the whole fruit
   intended in it, and the accomplishment of all the ends aimed at by it;
   -- that is, that it shall certainly and infallibly bring all those to
   God for whom he offered himself, by justifying, sanctifying, and
   preserving them, through the communication of his own Spirit and grace
   to them for that end and purpose, "all his promises being yea and amen
   in him," confirmed by his death, 2 Cor. i. 20; Heb. x. 12-17. Some of
   those who abuse the truth we have insisted on indeed pretend to grant
   "That by his death he made satisfaction for sin, but only on condition
   that men believe on him, and continue so doing; that they shall so
   believe, and so continue" (though he is said to be the "captain of our
   salvation," and the "author and finisher of our faith," though it be
   "given unto us for his sake to believe on him," and we are "blessed
   with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in him"), that he takes
   no care about beyond the general administration of outward means. He
   neither procured any such thing by his oblation, nor doth intercede for
   it. These things are left unto men, to be educed, drawn forth, and
   exercised, by virtue of sundry considerations that they may take upon
   themselves." Never, doubtless, did men take more pains to stain the
   beauty and comeliness of our dying Saviour.

   2dly. [As] for his intercession, the doctrine hitherto insisted on
   renders him therein exceeding lovely and desirable. It tells you that
   he doth "pray the Father," who thereupon "sendeth us the Comforter,"
   the Holy Spirit, for all the gracious acts and works, ends and
   purposes, before mentioned, with innumerable other privileges that the
   saints by him are made partakers of, and that to "abide with us for
   ever," never to leave us nor forsake us; that he continually "appears
   in the presence of God for us," interceding that our faith may not
   fail, pleading for us in and under all our decays, making out to us
   suitable supplies in all our distresses, temptations, trials, troubles,
   taking care that "no temptation befall us," but that "a way also of
   escape be given to us together with it;" -- it tells us his eye, even
   now he is in glory, is still upon us, seeing our wants, taking notice
   of our weakness, and providing for us, as his only concernment in the
   world, that we be not lost; that he hath not left one jot of that
   kindness which he bare to his flock, his lambs, his little ones, but
   pursues with all his strength, and all the interest he hath in heaven,
   the work of their salvation, which he came from his Father's bosom to
   enter on, and returned to him again to carry on unto perfection; that,
   as the high priest of old, he bears our names on his breast and on his
   shoulders continually before his Father: so that in all our falls and
   failings, when we are in ourselves helpless and hopeless, when there is
   nothing in us nor about us that can do us any good, or yield us any
   help or consolation, yet on this account we may say, "?The Lord is our
   shepherd, we shall not want:' he hath undertaken for us, and will bear
   us in his arms, until he bring us to the bosom of his Father."

   Now, whether such considerations as these, of the oblation and
   intercession of Christ, do not fill his love in them with a more
   constraining efficacy, and more draw out the hearts of the saints unto
   faith and love, than any instruction can do informing men of the
   uselessness of the one or other of these eminent acts of his mediation
   for any of the ends and purposes mentioned, let believers judge. That
   which men repose upon in their greatest necessities, and for the things
   of the greatest concernment, thereof they have the greatest valuation,
   and the thoughts of it are most fixed in their minds. What is there of
   so great concernment in this world unto the saints as their abiding
   with God unto the end? How many, how great, urging, pressing, are the
   difficulties, dangers, troubles, they meet withal in their so doing!
   What, then, they have most frequent recourse unto, and what they rest
   most upon under their pressures, in the things of that concernment
   before mentioned, that will deserve the name of their treasure, where
   their hearts will and ought to be. Now, if this (setting aside, as
   things of no consideration in such a case, the purposes, covenant, and
   promises of God, the oblation and intercession of the Lord Christ) be
   men's own rational abilities to consider what is for their good, and
   what will be hurtful and destructive to them, what can hinder but that
   men will, yea, and that they often should, spend the flower and best of
   their affections upon and about themselves and their own wisdom in and
   for their preservation? -- that doubtless will take up their hearts and
   thoughts, so that there will be very little room left for the
   entertainment of the Lord Jesus Christ with any regard or respect on
   this account. If that, then, may pass which was formerly laid down, --
   namely, that the doctrines and things which are apt and suited to the
   ingenerating, quickening, increasing, and building up, of faith and
   love towards God and our Lord Jesus Christ, are the most eminent gospel
   motives to spiritual, acceptable obedience (as it is an unquestionable
   truth and certainty), -- doubtless that doctrine which represents the
   Father and Son so rich in mercy, so loving and lovely to the soul, as
   that doth which we insist upon, must needs have a most effectual
   influence into that obedience.

   (5.) The doctrine insisted on hath an effectual influence into the
   obedience of the saints, upon the account of giving it its proper
   place, and setting it aright upon its basis, carrying it on in due
   order. It neither puts upon it the fetters of the law, nor turns it
   loose from the holy and righteous rule of it. Let men be as industrious
   as can be imagined in the performance of all commanded duties, yet if
   they do it on legal motives and for legal ends, all their performances
   are vitiated, and all their duties rejected. This the apostle asserts
   against the Jews, Rom. ix. 31, 32, "They sought for righteousness, but
   as it were by the works of the law;" and therefore he tells them, chap.
   x. 3, that "being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to the
   righteousness of God." And the Papists will one day find a fire
   proceeding out of their doctrine of merits, consuming all their good
   works as "hay and stubble." There are also many other ways and
   principles whereby obedience is vitiated, and rendered an abomination
   instead of sacrifice, wherein our doctrine is no sharer; but this I
   must not enter into, because it would lead me into other controversies,
   which with this I shall not intermix.

   (6.) It naturally and sweetly mixeth with all the ordinances of Christ
   instituted for the end under consideration; in particular, with that
   great ordinance, the ministry of the gospel, in reference to the great
   fruit and effect of it mentioned Eph. iv. 12, 13, "The perfecting of
   the saints, the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the
   unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
   perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."
   That which the Lord Jesus aimed at and intended principally in giving
   pastors and teachers to his church was, that they might carry on the
   work of the ministry for the perfecting of the saints, and their
   filling up the measure allotted unto them; and this they do by
   revealing the whole counsel of God unto them, keeping back nothing that
   is profitable for them; as was the practice of Paul, Acts xx. 20, 27.
   Of this counsel or will of God, as by them managed, there are two
   parts:--

   [1.] The discovery of God and his will to them, as to the state and
   condition whereunto he calls them, and which he requires them to come
   up unto; and this consists in doctrines revealing God and his will,
   which, contain rules and precepts for men to walk by and yield
   obedience unto.

   [2.] That which is suited to the carrying on of men in the state and
   condition whereunto they are called, according to the mind of God, as
   also to prevail with them to whom the word doth come to enter into the
   state of obedience and walking with God; and this is usually branched
   into three general heads, of promises, exhortations, and threatenings.
   The management of these aright with power and efficacy, with evidence
   and demonstration of the Spirit, is no small part, yea, it is the
   greatest part, of the work of the ministry, the greatest portion of
   what is doctrinal in the word or book of God relating to these heads.
   And of this part of that ordinance of Christ, the "ministry of the
   word," the pressing of men into a state of obedience and to a progress
   in that estate, by promises, exhortations, and threatenings, I shall
   briefly speak, either by way of demonstration and proof of what lieth
   before me, or in vindication of what is affirmed in the same kind from
   the objections and exceptions of him in particular with whom I have to
   do; aiming still at my former assertion, that the doctrine I have
   insisted on naturally and clearly closeth with those promises and
   exhortations, to help on their efficacy and energy for the
   accomplishment of the work intended.

   1st. For the first, let us take a taste of the promises, which are, as
   it were, the very life and beauty of the covenant of grace, and the
   glory of the ministry committed unto men; and they are of two sorts,
   both of which have their effectual influence into the obedience of
   saints:--

   (1st.) There are promises which express only the work of God's grace,
   and what he will freely do in and upon the hearts of his thereby, as to
   the working holiness and obedience in them, as also of his pardoning
   mercy in his free acceptance of them in Jesus Christ; and these are in
   a peculiar manner those "better promises" of the covenant of grace,
   upon the account whereof it is so exceedingly exalted above that of
   works, which by sin was broken and disannulled, Heb. viii. 6-12.

   (2dly.) There are promises of what good and great things God will
   farther do unto and for them who obey him; as, that he will keep them
   and preserve them that they shall not be lost, that their labour and
   obedience shall end in the enjoyment of God himself, with an immortal
   crown of glory which shall never fade away, Heb. xi. 9, 10.

   Now, the doctrine of the saints' perseverance, and the stability of the
   love of God unto them, closeth with the promises of both these sorts,
   as to the end of carrying on and increasing obedience and holiness in
   them. Take an instance in the first. The promises of the work of God's
   grace in us and towards us are effectual as appointed to this end: so
   in that great word, Gen. xvii. 1, (which the apostle calls "The
   promise," Gal. iii. 17,) "I am the Almighty God;" -- "I am so, and will
   be so to thee, and that for and to all ends and purposes of the
   covenant whatsoever." The inference is, "Walk before me, and be thou
   perfect." Walking with God in uprightness and sincerity is the proper
   fruit in us of his promise to be our all-sufficient God in covenant;
   as, Jer. xxxi. 33, our becoming the "people of God" in walking with him
   in all ways of obedience is the effect of his promise "to be our God,
   and to write his law in our hearts," not only because by the grace of
   the promise we are brought into a state of acceptance, and made the
   people of God, but also upon the account of the engagement that is put
   upon us by that gracious promise to live unto him; whence in the close
   it is affirmed "we shall be his people." The word of the gospel, or the
   word of faith, doth mainly consist in this; and what the aim of that is
   the apostle declares, Titus ii. 11, 12, "The grace of God that bringeth
   salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
   godly, in this present world." Which general purport of the promises in
   this way is farther asserted, 2 Cor. vii. 1, "Having," saith he, "these
   promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and
   spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." And most eminently is
   this assigned to the promises of that sort which we now peculiarly
   insist upon, 2 Pet. i. 3, 4. To know the way whereby these or any other
   promises are effectual to the end and purpose intimated, two things are
   considerable:-- First, What is required to make them so effectual;
   Secondly, Wherein and how they do exert that efficacy that is in them.
   For the first, the apostle acquaints us on what account alone it is
   that they come to be useful in this or any other kind: Heb. iv. 2, "The
   word of the gospel," the promise preached to them of old, "did not
   profit them," did them no good at all. And the reason of this sad
   success in the preaching of the gospel and declaration of the promises
   he gives you in the same verse; it is that the word was "not mixed with
   faith in them that heard it." It is the mixing of the promises with
   faith that renders them useful and profitable. Now, to whatever faith
   is required, the more firm, strong, and stable it is, the more
   effectual and useful it is. That, then, which is apt to establish
   faith, to support, and strengthen it, to preserve it from staggering,
   that renders the promise most useful and effectual for the
   accomplishment of any work whereunto it is designed, Rom. iv. 20. Now,
   faith in the promises respects the accomplishment of the things
   promised, as the apostle tells us in that commended and
   never-enough-imitated example of the faith of Abraham: Rom. iv. 19-21,
   "Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when
   he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
   womb: he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
   strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that
   what he had promised he was able also to perform." Laying aside all
   considerations that might tend to the impairing of his confidence, he
   firmly believed that it should be to him as God had promised. That the
   doctrine we insist on is clearly conducing to the establishing of faith
   in the promises cannot tolerably be called into question. Whatsoever is
   in those promises, whatsoever considerations or concernments of Him
   whose they are, as his faithfulness, unchangeableness, and omnipotency,
   that are apt to strengthen faith in them, it preserves entire and
   exalteth. It is a wild assertion, which men scarce search their own
   hearts (if, indeed, men know what belongs to believing in sincerity)
   when they make, that the efficacy of the promises unto our obedience
   should arise from hence, that the things promised may not be fulfilled,
   and that the weakness of faith (and every such supposal doth at least
   weaken it, yea, and tends to its subversion) should render the promise
   useful, which hath no use at all but as it is "mixed with faith." For
   instance, the promise that God will be an all-sufficient God unto us,
   that he will "circumcise our hearts and write his law in them, that we
   shall fear him," is, as was manifested before, a useful meditation for
   the ingenerating and quickening of obedience and holiness in us. That
   it may be such a means, it is required that it be "mixed with faith in
   them that hear it," as was declared. According as faith is strong or
   weak, so will its usefulness be. I ask, then, whether this be a proper
   way to set this promise on work for the end proposed, namely, to
   persuade them that should believe it that all this may be otherwise, --
   God may cease to be their God, their hearts, may not be circumcised,
   nor the law mentioned written in theme. Is this the way to strengthen
   their faith and to keep them from staggering? or rather, to subvert and
   cast down all their confidence to the ground? The doctrine we have
   under consideration continually sounds in the ears of believers that
   "God is faithful" in all his promises, 1 Cor. i. 9; that he can, that
   he will, make them good; that his own excellencies, his own
   perfections, require no less at his hands. And this it doth, not on any
   grounds that carry any thing with them that may seem to incline to the
   least neglect of God, or contempt of any property, excellency, or word
   of his, and so be apt to breed presumption, and not faith, but on such
   only as give him the glory of all that he hath revealed of himself unto
   us. And therefore its genuine tendency must be to beget and increase
   precious and saving faith in the hearts of men; which we conceive to
   lie in a more direct way of efficacy towards holiness and obedience
   than the ingenerating of servile fears gendering unto bondage can do.

   This, then, we have obtained:-- first, That the promises peculiarly
   insisted on are motives to and furtherances of obedience; secondly,
   That the way whereby they become so is by being mixed with faith, and
   the stronger faith is, the more effectual will the working of those
   promises unto holiness be; thirdly, That the doctrine of the
   perseverance of the saints, and stability of God's love to them, giving
   him the glory of all his excellencies, which in his promises are to be
   considered, is suited to the carrying on of faith in its growth and
   increase. Indeed, that which makes our belief of the promises of faith
   divine is the rise it hath and the bottom whereinto it is resolved, --
   namely, the excellencies of Him who makes the promises, as that he is
   true, faithful, all-sufficient; the glory of all which is given him in
   believing, as the apostle informs us, Rom. iv. 20, 21. Yea, and all
   this he must be believed to be in reference to the accomplishment of
   his promises, or we believe them not with divine, supernatural (if that
   term may be allowed), and saving faith. Surely they must needs think us
   very easy of belief, and wholly unexperienced in any communion with
   God, who shall suppose that we will be persuaded that the doctrine
   which eminently asserts and ascribes unto God the glory of all his
   attributes, which he would have us to eye in his promises,
   strengthening faith on that account, doth annihilate the promises in
   the word of the ministry, as to their usefulness unto our obedience.
   Let us deal by instance: God hath promised to "begin and perfect a good
   work in us." According as the promise is "mixed with faith," so it will
   be useful and profitable to us. If there be no faith, it will be of no
   use; if little, of little; if more, of more. Let a man now be supposed
   to be wavering about his mixing this promise with faith, whereupon the
   issue of its efficacy and fruitfulness, as was said, doth depend, and
   let the doctrine we teach be called in to speak in this ease, and let
   us try whether what it says be prejudicial to establishment of faith,
   or whether it be not all that looks towards its confirmation. It says,
   then, unto the soul of a believer, "Why art thou so cast down, thou
   poor soul? and why are thy thoughts perplexed within thee? It is true,
   thou art weak, unstable, ready to fall away, and to perish. Thy
   temptations are many, great, and prevalent, and thou hast no strength
   to stand against the power and multitude of them. But look a little
   upon Him who hath promised that thou shalt never depart from Him, who
   hath promised to finish the good work begun. He is unchangeable in his
   purposes, faithful in his promises, and will put forth the exceeding
   greatness of his power' for the accomplishment of them; so that though
   thou failest, he will cause thee to renew thy strength, though thou
   fallest, thou shalt not be cast down. He hath undertaken to work, and
   who shall let him? The counsel of his heart, as to the fulfilling of
   it, doth not depend on any thing in us. What sins thou art overtaken
   withal he will pardon, and will effectually supply thee with his
   Spirit, that thou shalt not fall into or continue in such sins as would
   cut off thy communion with him." And doth not this mix the
   forementioned promises with faith, and so render it effectual to the
   carrying on of the work of love and obedience, as was mentioned? And as
   this doctrine is suited to the establishment of the soul in believing,
   and to the stirring of men up to mix the promises with faith, so there
   is not any thing that is or can be thought more effectual to the
   weakening, impairing, and shattering, of the faith of the saints than
   that which is contrary thereunto, as shall afterward be more fully
   manifested. Tell a soul that God will write his law in him, and put his
   fear in his inward parts, that he shall never depart from him; what can
   ye possibly pitch upon to unsettle him as to a persuasion of the
   accomplishment of this promise, and that it shall be so indeed as God
   hath spoken, but only this: "According as thou behavest thyself (which
   is left unto thee), so shall this be made good or come short of
   accomplishment: if thou continue to walk with God (which that thou
   shalt do he doth not promise, but upon condition thou walk with him),
   it shall be well; and if thou turn aside, which thou mayst do,
   notwithstanding any thing here spoken or intimated, then the word
   spoken shall be of none effect, the promise shall not be fulfilled
   towards thee?" I know not what the most malicious devil in hell (if
   they have degrees of malice) can invent more suited to weaken the faith
   of men, as to the accomplishment of God's promise, than by affirming
   that it doth not depend upon his truth and faithfulness, but solely on
   their good behaviour, which he doth not effectually provide that, it
   shall be such as is required thereunto. God himself hath long since
   determined this difference, might he be attended unto.

   What hath been spoken of the promises of the first sort might also be
   manifested concerning those of the second; and the like might also be
   cleared up in reference to those other weapons of ministers' warfare,
   in casting down the strongholds of sin in the hearts of men, to wit,
   exhortations and threatenings, But because Mr Goodwin hath taken great
   pains, both in the general, to prove the unsuitableness of our doctrine
   to the promotion of obedience and a holy conversation, and in
   particular its inconsistency with the exhortations and threatenings of
   the word, managed by the ordinances of the ministry, what is needful
   farther to be added to the purpose in hand will fall in with our
   vindication and rescuing of the truth from the false criminations
   wherewith it is assaulted and reproached as to this particular; and
   therefore I shall immediately address myself to the consideration of
   his long indictment and charge against the doctrine of the perseverance
   of the saints as to this very thing.

Chapter XI. Arguments against the doctrine considered.

   The entrance into an answer to Mr G.'s arguments against the doctrine
   of the saints' perseverance -- His sixth argument about the usefulness
   of the doctrine under consideration to the work of the ministry
   proposed -- His proof of the minor proposition considered and answered
   -- Many pretenders to promote godliness by false doctrines -- Mr G.'s
   common interest in this argument -- His proofs of the usefulness of his
   doctrine unto the promotion of godliness considered and answered -- The
   consequence of his arguing discovered -- The doctrine by him opposed
   mistaken, ignorantly or wilfully -- Objections proposed by Mr G. to
   himself to he answered -- The objection as proposed disowned --
   Certainty of the love of God, in what sense a motive to obedience --
   The doctrine of apostasy denies the unchangeableness of God's love to
   believers placeth qualifications in the room of persons -- How the
   doctrine of perseverance promiseth the continuance of the love of God
   to believers -- Certainty of reward encouraging to regular action --
   Promises made to persons qualified, not suspended upon those
   qualifications -- Means appointed of God for the accomplishment of a
   determined end certain -- Means not always conditions -- Mr G.'s
   strange inference concerning the Scripture considered -- The word of
   God by him undervalued and subjected to the judgment of vain men as to
   its truth and authority -- The pretended reason of the former
   proceeding discussed -- The Scripture the sole judge of what is to be
   ascribed to God, and believed concerning him -- The doctrine of the
   saints' perseverance falsely imposed on, and vindicated -- Mr G.'s next
   objection made to himself against his doctrine -- Its unseasonableness
   as to the argument in hand demonstrated -- No assurance of the love of
   God, nor peace left the saints, by the doctrine of apostasy -- The
   ground of peace and assurance by it taken away -- Ground of Paul's
   consolation, 1 Cor. ix. 27 -- The meaning of the word adokimos --
   Another plea against the doctrine attempted to be proved by Mr G. --
   That attempt considered -- Not the weakness of the flesh naturally, but
   the strength of lust spiritually pretended -- The cause of sin in the
   saints farther discussed -- The power ascribed by Mr G. to men for the
   strengthening and making willing the Spirit in them considered -- The
   aptness of the saints to perform, what and whence -- The opposition
   they have in them thereunto -- Gospel obedience, how easy -- The
   conclusion -- Answer to chap. xiii. of his book proposed.

   The argument wherein Mr Goodwin exposeth the doctrine under contest to
   the trial concerning its usefulness as to the promotion of godliness in
   the hearts and ways of them by whom it is received, he thus proposeth,
   chap. xiii. sect. 32, p. 333, "That doctrine which is according to
   godliness, and whose natural and proper tendency is to promote
   godliness in the hearts and lives of men, is evangelical, and of
   unquestionable comportance with the truth; such is the doctrine which
   teacheth the possibility of the saints' declining, both totally and
   finally: ergo."

   Of this argument he goeth about to establish the respective
   propositions, so as to make them serviceable to the enforcement of the
   conclusion he sinneth at, for the exaltation of the Helena whereof he
   is enamoured; and as for the major proposition (about which, rightly
   understood, we are remote from contesting with him or any else, and
   will willingly and cheerfully at any time drive the cause in difference
   to issue upon the singular testimony of the truth wrapped up in it), he
   thus confirmeth it:--

   "The reason of the major proposition, though the truth of it needed no
   light but its own to be seen by, is, because the gospel itself is a
   doctrine which is according unto godliness, a mystery of godliness, --
   is a doctrine, truth, and mystery, calculated, contrived, and framed by
   God with a singular aptness and choiceness of ingredients for the
   advancement of godliness in the world. Therefore, what particular
   doctrine is of the same spirit, tendency, and import, must needs be a
   natural branch thereof, and hath perfect accord with it. This
   proposition, then, is unquestionable."

   Ans. According to the principles formerly laid down, I have something
   to say, though not to the proposition itself, as in the terms it lieth,
   but only as to the fixedness and staidness of it, that it may not be a
   nose of wax, to be turned to and fro at every one's pleasure, to serve
   their turns; for what sort of men is there in the world, professing the
   name of Christ, that do not lay claim to an interest in this
   proposition for the confirmation of their opinions? It is but as a
   common exordium in rhetoric, a useless flourish: "The doctrine which is
   according to godliness," -- that is, which the Scripture teacheth to be
   true, and to serve for the promotion of godliness (not what doctrine
   soever any dark, brain-sick creature doth apprehend so to do), in the
   state and condition wherein the saints of God walk with him, -- "is a
   branch of the gospel." I add, "In the state and condition wherein we
   walk with God;" for in the state of innocency, the doctrine of the law,
   as a covenant of life, was of singular aptness and usefulness to
   promote obedience, which yet is not therefore any branch or part of the
   gospel, but opposite to it and destructive of it. All the advantage,
   then, Mr Goodwin can expect, from this argument to his cause dependeth
   upon the proof of the minor proposition, which also must be effected in
   answerable proportion to the restrictions and qualifications given to
   the major, or the whole will be void and of none effect; that is, he
   must prove it by the testimony of God to be "according to godliness,"
   and not give us in (by a pure begging of the thing in question) that it
   is so in his apprehension, and according to the principles whereon he
   doth proceed in the teaching and asserting of godliness. Mr Goodwin
   knows that there is no less difference between him and us about the
   nature and causes of godliness than there is about the perseverance of
   the saints; and therefore his asserting any doctrine to be suited to
   the promotion of godliness, that assertion being proportioned to his
   other hypothesis of his own, wherein we accord not with him, and in
   particular to his notions of the causes and nature of godliness, with
   which conceptions of his we have no communion, it cannot be of any
   weight with us unless he prove his affirmation according to the
   limitations before expressed. Now, this he attempteth in the words
   following:--

   "What doctrine," saith he, "can there be more proper and powerful to
   promote godliness in the hearts and lives of men, than that which on
   the one hand promiseth a crown of blessedness and eternal glory to
   those that live godlily without declining, and on the other hand
   threateneth the vengeance of hell-fire eternally against those that
   shall turn aside into profaneness, and not return by repentance?
   whereas the doctrine which promiseth, and that with all possible
   certainty and assurance, all fullness of blessedness and glory to those
   that shall at any time be godly, though they shall the very next day or
   hour degenerate, and turn loose and profane, and continue never so long
   in such a course, is most manifestly destructive to godliness, and
   encouraging above measure unto profaneness."

   Ans. There are two parts of this discourse, the one kataskeuastike, or
   confirmatory of his own thesis; the other anaskeuastike, or destructive
   of that which he opposeth. For the first, it is upon the matter all
   that he produceth for the confirmation of his minor proposition,
   wherein any singular concernment of his opinion doth lie. Now, that
   being, in a sound sense, the common inheritance of all that profess the
   truth, under what deceits or mistakes soever, the sum of what is here
   insisted on is, that the doctrine he maintaineth, concerning "the
   possibility of the saints' defection, promiseth a crown to them that
   continue in obedience, and threateneth vengeance of fire to them that
   turn to profaneness;" which, taken as a proof of his former assertion,
   is liable to some small exceptions: as, --

   1. That this doth not at all prove the doctrine to be a branch or
   parcel of the gospel, it being, as it standeth severally by itself, the
   pure tenor of the covenant of works; which we confess to have been of
   singular importance for the propagation of godliness and holiness in
   them to whom it was given or with whom it was made, being given and
   made for that very end and purpose. But that this alone by itself is a
   peculiar branch or parcel of the gospel, or that it is of such singular
   importance for the carrying on of gospel obedience, as so by itself
   proposed, that should here have been proved.

   2. As it is also a part of the gospel, declaring the faithfulness of
   God, and the end and issue of the proposal of the gospel unto men, and
   of their receiving or refusing of it, so it is altogether foreign to
   the doctrine of Mr Goodwin under contest. And he might as well have
   said that the doctrine of apostasy is of singular import for the
   promotion of holiness, because the doctrine of justification by faith
   is so; for what force of consequence is betwixt these two: "That God is
   a rewarder of them that obey him, and a punisher of them that rebel
   against him, is an incentive to obedience; therefore the doctrine that
   true believers united to Jesus Christ may utterly fall out of the
   favour of God, and turn from their obedience, and be damned for ever,
   there being no promise of God for their preservation, is also an
   incentive to holiness?"

   3. What virtue soever there may be in this truth for the furtherance
   and promotion of holiness in the world, our doctrine layeth as dear
   claim to it as yours; that is, there is not any thing in the least in
   it inconsistent therewithal. We grant God threateneth the vengeance of
   hell-fire unto those that turn aside from their profession of holiness
   into profaneness, the gospel itself becoming thereby unto them "a
   savour of death unto death," the Lord thereby proclaiming to all the
   world that "the wages of sin" and infidelity "is death," and that "he
   that believeth not shall be damned;" but that any thing can hence be
   inferred for the apostasy of true believers, or how this assertion
   cometh to be appropriated to that doctrine, we see not.

   The latter part of this discourse, whereby its author aimeth to exclude
   the doctrine hitherto asserted by us from any claim laid to usefulness
   for the promotion of godliness, is either a mistake of it, through
   ignorance of the opinion he hath undertaken to oppose, or a wilful
   perverting of it, contrary to his own science and conscience. Is that
   the doctrine you oppose? Is it so proposed by those who, through grace,
   have laboured to explain and vindicate it? Doth not the main weight of
   the doctrine turn on this hinge, that God hath promised to his saints,
   true believers, such supplies of the Spirit and grace as that they
   shall never degenerate into such loose and profane courses as are
   destructive to godliness? Doubtless that doctrine is of a most
   spotless, untainted innocency, which its adversaries dare not venture
   to strangle before they have violently and treacherously defloured it.

   And thus Mr Goodwin leaveth his arguments in the dust, like the
   ostrich's eggs, under the feet of men, to be trampled on with ease.

   The residue of this discourse, onwards to the next argument, being
   spent in the answering of pretended objections, put in against himself
   in the behalf of the doctrine of perseverance, not at all called out by
   the import of his present arguments and discourses, I might pass them
   over; but inasmuch as that which is spoken thereunto tendeth to the
   farther clearing of what formerly hath been evidenced concerning the
   suitableness of the doctrine contended for unto the promotion of
   holiness, I shall farther consider what he draweth forth on this
   occasion. Sect. 33, he giveth us an objection, and a fourfold answer
   thereunto, pp. 333-335. That which he calleth an objection he layeth
   down in these words:--

   "If it be objected and said, Yea, but assurance of the unchangeableness
   of God's love towards him that is godly is both a more effectual and
   persuading motive unto godliness, and more encouraging to a persevering
   in godliness, than a doubtfulness or uncertainty whether God will be
   constant in his affection to such a man or no; certainty of reward is
   more encouraging unto action than uncertainty.'?"

   Ans. If any one hath been so weak as to make use of this plea in behalf
   of that doctrine it seemeth to defend (which I scarcely believe), it
   will, I doubt not, be an easy task to undertake that he shall be no
   more admitted or entertained as an advocate in this cause. The
   assurance of the unchangeableness of God's love to them that are godly
   is but one part of the doctrine in hand, and that such as may perhaps
   be common to it with that which is brought into competition with it. It
   is the assurance of the unchangeableness of God's love to a man, to
   keep him up to godliness, to preserve him in that state and condition
   of holiness to the end, and of the certainty of the continuance of the
   love of God unto him on that account and in that way, that is that
   great gospel motive to obedience wherein, as its peculiar, our doctrine
   glorieth, as hath formerly been manifested. Perhaps Mr Goodwin doth not
   think that any man is bound to lay more blocks in his own way than he
   judgeth himself well able to remove; and therefore he framed that
   objection, so that he might be sure to return at least a specious
   answer thereunto, and this he attempteth accordingly, and telleth us in
   his first paragraph three things:--

   1. "That the doctrine teaching the saints' defection doth also maintain
   the unchangeableness of the love of God to them that are godly."

   Ans. But what love, I pray you, is that which, when it might prevent
   it, will yet suffer those godly ones to become such ungodly villains
   and wretches as that it shall be utterly impossible for the Lord to
   continue his love to them? Is the love you mention indeed a love to
   their persons, or only an approbation of their duties and
   qualifications? If the first, whence is it that God ceaseth at any time
   to love them? Doth he change and alter his love like the sons of men?
   "Why, they change, therefore he changeth also." That God changeth not,
   and therefore we, who are subject to change, are yet preserved from
   being consumed, we have heard; but that, upon the change that is in
   men, God also should change, we are yet to be instructed; and the
   immutability of God hath taken greater hold upon our understandings and
   in our hearts than that we should easily receive any thing so
   diametrically opposite thereunto. If the love mentioned be only an
   approbation of the qualifications that are in them, and of the duties
   that they do perform, then is it no more a love to them or to their
   persons than it is to the persons of the most profligate wretches that
   live. The object is duty solely, where-ever it may be found, and not
   any person at all; for it is an act of God's approving, not purposing
   or determining, will. This is not our sense, of the continuance of the
   love of God to them that are godly. So that there is no comparison
   betwixt the doctrines under contest, as to the asserting of the love of
   God to believers, or to them that are godly. Wherefore he saith, --

   2. "That the doctrine he opposeth promiseth God's love and the
   unchangeable continuance of it unto men, though they change to
   profaneness." Though this is said over and over a hundred times, yet I
   cannot believe it, because the doctrine openly affirmeth the
   continuance of the love of God to them that are godly to be effectually
   and eventually preventive of any such profaneness as is inconsistent
   therewithal. And therefore much more vain is that which he affirmeth in
   the third place, namely, --

   3. "That the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints doth not so
   much absolutely promise the love of God to them that are godly as it
   promiseth it conditionally to them that are profane, in case they have
   been godly; that is, it teacheth that God promiseth the certain
   continuance of his love to him that is godly, on condition he cease to
   be so and turn profane."

   "Claudite jam rivos, pueri." We have enough of this already.

   He addeth yet, "Neither is certainty of reward in every sense or kind
   more encouraging unto action than uncertainty in some kind. To promise
   with all possible assurance the same reward or prize to him that shall
   not run in the race which is promised to him that shall run, is not
   more encouraging unto men thus to run than to promise it conditionally
   upon their running; which is a promising of it with uncertainty in this
   respect, because it is uncertain whether men will run in the said race
   or no, and consequently whether they shall receive the said prize or
   no, upon such a promise. Uncertainty of reward is, then, and in such
   cases, more encouraging unto action than certainty, when the certainty
   of obtaining or receiving it is suspended upon the act, not when it is
   assured unto men whether they act or no."

   Ans. (1.) Persuade your servants, your labourers, if you can, of that
   great encouragement that lies in the uncertainty of a reward above that
   which may be had from an assurance thereof. We are not as yet of that
   mind. And yet, --

   (2.) We do not lay the motive unto obedience tendered by the doctrine
   we contest for only on the certainty of reward which it asserteth, --
   which yet is such that without it all others must needs be of little
   purpose, -- but it hath also other advantageous influences into the
   promotion of holiness, which in part have been insisted on.

   (3.) It seemeth we say that "God promiseth a reward to them that shall
   not run a race," because we maintain that he promiseth it to none but
   those who do run in a race, promising withal to give them strength,
   power, and will, that they may do so to the end.

   (4.) For the close, which amounteth to this, that the certainty of
   reward when it is uncertain (for so it is made to be when it is
   suspended on actions that are uncertain) is more encouraging to action
   than certainty of reward not so suspended, I shall add only (because I
   know not indeed how this discourse hangeth on the business under
   consideration), that we neither suspend the certainty of reward upon
   our actions in the sense intimated, neither do we say that it is
   assured to men whether they act or no; but we say that the reward,
   which is of grace, through the unchangeable love of God, shall be given
   to them that act in holiness; and through the same love shall all
   believers be kept to such an acting of holiness as God thinketh good to
   carry them out unto, for the "fulfilling of all the good pleasure of
   his goodness in them, and for making them meet for the inheritance of
   the saints in light." We do not think mediums designed of God for the
   accomplishment of any end are such conditions of the end that it is
   suspended on them in uncertainty in respect of the issue before its
   accomplishment; neither do we grant, nor can it be proved, that God
   assigneth any medium for the accomplishment of a determinate end (such
   as we have proved the salvation of all believers to be), and leaves it
   in such a condition as that not only it shall be effected and produced
   suitably to the nature of the immediate cause of which it is, whether
   free, necessary, or contingent, but also shall be so far uncertain as
   that it may or may not be wrought and accomplished.

   The former part of this third paragraph is but a repetition of an
   assertion which, upon the credit of his own single testimony, we have
   had often tendered, namely, "That an assurance given him that is godly
   of the love of God not depending on any thing in him, which it is
   uncertain whether he will perform or no, is no motive to men to
   continue in the ways of holiness." This, as I said before, I cannot
   close withal. That that which is a motive to faith and love, and
   eminently suited to the stirring of them up, and setting them on work,
   is also a motive to the obedience which is called "work of faith and
   labour of love," hath been declared. If there be any thing of the new
   and heavenly nature in the soul, any quality or disposition of a child
   therein, what can be more effectual to promote or advance the fear,
   honour, and reverence of God in it, than an assurance of his Spirit to
   continue and preserve it in those ways which are well pleasing unto
   him? It is confessed that, in many promises of acceptation here and
   reward hereafter, the things and duties that are the means and ways of
   enjoying the one and attaining the other are mentioned, not as
   conditions of the grace and love of God to them to whom the promises
   are made, as though they should depend on any thing of their uncertain
   accomplishment, as hath been declared, but only as the means and ways
   which God hath appointed for men to use and walk in unto those ends,
   and which he hath absolutely promised to work in them and to continue
   to them.

   4. The close of this paragraph, in the fourth place, deserveth a little
   more clear consideration, it containing an assertion which some would
   not; believe when it was told them, and which hath stumbled not a few
   at the repetition of it. Thus, then, he proceedeth:--

   "Besides, whether any such assurance of the unchangeableness of the
   love of God towards him that is godly, as the objection speaketh of,
   can be effectually and upon sufficient grounds cleared and proved, is
   very questionable, yea, I conceive there is more reason to judge
   otherwise than so. Yea, that which is more, I verily believe that in
   case any such assurance of the unchangeableness of God's love were to
   be found in, or could regularly be deduced from, the Scriptures, it
   were a just ground to any intelligent and considering man to question
   their authority, and whether they were from God or no; for that a God
   infinitely righteous and holy should irreversibly assure the immortal
   and undefiled inheritance of his grace and favour unto any creature
   whatsoever, so that though this creature should prove never so
   abominable in his sight, never so outrageously and desperately wicked
   and profane, he should not be at liberty to withhold this inheritance
   from him, is a saying doubtless too hard for any man who rightly
   understandeth and considereth the nature of God to bear."

   Ans. The love mentioned in the foregoing objection is that which God
   beareth to them that are godly in Jesus Christ, exerting itself partly
   in his gracious acceptation of their persons in the Son of his love,
   partly in giving to them of his Holy Spirit and grace, so that they
   shall never depart utterly and wickedly from him, and forsake him, or
   reject him from being their God. Whether an assurance of this love may
   on good grounds be given to believers bath been already considered, and
   the affirmative, I hope, in some good measure confirmed; the farther
   demonstration of it awaiting its proper season, which the will of God
   shall give unto it. This Mr Goodwin saith to him is "questionable;"
   yea, I suppose it is with him out of question, that it cannot be, else
   surely he would not have taken so much pains in labouring to disprove
   it. And that this is his resolved judgment he manifesteth in the next
   words, "I verily believe that in case any such assurance were to be
   found," etc.; that is, "Si Deus homini non placuerit, Deus non erit."
   What more contemptible could the Pagans of old have spoken of their
   dunghill deities, with their amphibolous [i.e., ambiguous] oracles?
   Were it not fitter language for the Indian conjurers, who beat and
   afflict their hellish gods if they answer not according to their
   desires? The whole authority of God, and of his word in the Scriptures,
   is here cast down before the consideration of an "intelligent man"
   (forsooth), or "a vain man that would be wise, but is like the wild
   ass's colt." And this "intelligent man," it seems, may contend to
   reject the word of God, and yet be accounted most wise! Of old, the
   prophet thought not so. To what end is any farther dispute? If the
   Scripture speaketh not to Mr Goodwin's mind (for doubtless he is "an
   intelligent and considering man"), he seeth sufficient ground to
   question its authority. By what way possible any man can more advance
   himself into the throne of God than by entertaining such thoughts and
   conceptions as these, I know not. An "intelligent man" is supposed to
   have from himself, and his own wisdom and intelligence, considerations
   of God's nature and perfections by which he is to regulate and measure
   all things that are affirmed of God or his will in the Scripture. If
   what is so delivered suit these conceptions of his, that Scripture
   wherein it is delivered may pass for canonical and authentic; if
   otherwise, "eadem facilitate rejicitur qua asseritur," which was
   sometimes spoken of traditionals, but, it seems, may now be extended to
   the written word. The Scripture is supposed to hold out things contrary
   to what this "intelligent man" hath conceived and considered, and this
   is asserted as a just ground to question its authority; and if this be
   not a progress in the contempt of the word of God to whatever yet
   Papists, Socinians, or enthusiasts, have attempted, I am deceived. "To
   the law and to the testimony" with all the conceptions and notions of
   the most intelligent men: if they answer not to this rule, "it is cause
   there is no light in them."

   But he addeth the reason of this bold assertion; for saith he, "That a
   God infinitely righteous and holy should irreversibly," etc.

   Ans. Neither yet doth this at all mend the matter. Neither doth the
   particular instance given alter at all, but confirm the first general
   assertion, -- namely, "That if there be any thing in the Scriptures
   contrary to those thoughts of God which an intelligent man (without the
   Scripture) doth conceive of him, he hath just grounds to question their
   authority;" which wholly casts down the word of God from its
   excellency, and setteth a poor, dark, blind creature, under the notion
   of an "intelligent man," at liberty from his subjection thereunto,
   making him his own rule and guide as to his apprehensions of God and
   his will. And is it possible that such a thought should enter into the
   heart of a man fearing God and reverencing his word, which God hath
   magnified above all his name? There is scarce any one truth in the
   whole book of God, but some men, passing in the world for "intelligent
   and considering men," do look upon it and profess it to be unworthy of
   an infinitely righteous and holy God. So do the Socinians think of the
   doctrine of the satisfaction of Christ, the great treasure of the
   church. At the rate that men pass at in this world, it will be
   difficult to exclude many of them from the number of "intelligent and
   considering men;" and are they not all absolved here by Mr Goodwin, on
   this principle, from bowing to the authority of God in the Scriptures,
   hawing "just ground to question whether they are from God or no?" The
   case is the same with the Papists and others, in sundry particulars.
   Frame the supposition how you will, in things never so uncouth and
   strange, yet if this be the position, that in things which appear so to
   men, upon their consideration, if any thing in the Scripture be hem out
   or may be deduced from this to the contrary, they are at liberty from
   submitting their understandings to them, and may arraign them as false
   and supposititious, their whole divine authority is unquestionably cast
   down to the ground, and trampled on by the feet of men. Kai tauta men
   pros pauta. God will take care for the vindication of the honour of his
   word.

   The supposition here made by Mr Goodwin, and imposed on his
   adversaries, is, as hath been showed, wretchedly false, not once spoken
   or owned by them with whom he hath to do, not having the least colour
   given unto it by the doctrine they maintain; yea, it is diametrically
   opposite thereunto. The main of what they teach, and which Mr Goodwin
   hath opposed in this treatise, endeavouring to answer that eminent
   place of John iii. 9, with many others produced and argued to that
   purpose, is, that God will, according to the tenor of the covenant of
   grace, so write his law in the hearts of his, and put his fear in their
   inward parts, that they shall never depart from him, so as to become
   "desperately and outrageously profane," but be preserved such to the
   end as that the Lord, with the greatest advantage of glory to his
   infinite wisdom, righteousness, and holiness, may "irreversibly assure
   the immortal inheritance of his love and favour unto them." So that Mr
   Goodwin's discourse to the end of this section, concerning the
   continuance of the love of God to them that are wicked, with an equal
   measure of favour to them that are godly, according to this doctrine,
   is vain and grossly sophistical, and such as he himself knoweth to be
   so. To say "every one that doth evil is good in the sight of the Lord,
   and that he delighteth in him," -- that is, he approveth wicked and
   ungodly men, -- we know is sufficiently dishonourable to him; but yet
   to say that he delighteth in his church and people, washed and made
   holy in the blood of Christ, notwithstanding their failings, or their
   being sometimes overtaken with great sins, when he pleaseth, in an
   extraordinary way, for ends best known to himself, to permit them to
   fall into them (which yet he doth seldom and rarely), is that which
   himself affirmeth and ascribeth to himself in innumerable places of
   Scripture (if their authority may pass unquestioned), to the praise of
   the glory of his grace. But it seemeth, if we take any care that Mr
   Goodwin may not call the authority of the Scriptures into question (he
   being fully resolved that the doctrine of the saints' perseverance is
   unworthy of a holy and righteous God), we must give over all attempts
   of farther deducing it from them; but yet, for the present, we shall
   consider what he hath farther to object against it.

   Sect. 34, he farther objecteth against himself and his doctrine, in the
   behalf of that which he doth oppose, in these words:--

   "It is possible that yet some will farther object against the argument
   in hand: Unless the saints be assured of the perpetuity of their
   standing in the grace and favour of God, they must needs be under fears
   of falling away, and so of perishing; and fear, we know, is of a
   discouraging and enfeebling nature, an enemy unto such actions which
   men of confidence and courage are apt to undertake.'?"

   Ans. What this objection maketh in this place I know not. It neither
   asserteth any eminency in the doctrine by Mr Goodwin opposed, as to the
   promotion of godliness, nor immediately challengeth that which he doth
   maintain of a contrary tendency, but only intimateth that the saints'
   consolation and peace is weakened by unnecessary fears, -- such as his
   opinion is apt to ingenerate in them. But, however, thus far I own it,
   as to the main of the observation in hand, that the doctrine of the
   apostasy of believers is apt and suited to cut the saints of God and
   heirs of the promise short of that strong consolation which he is so
   abundantly willing that they should receive, and to fill their souls
   and perplex their consciences with cares, fears, and manifold
   entanglements, suited to weaken their faith and love, and alienate
   their hearts from that delight in God to which they are called, and
   otherwise would be carried forth unto. They being all of them, in some
   measure, acquainted with the strength, subtlety, and power, of
   indwelling sin; the advantages of Satan in his manifold temptations;
   the eminent success which they see every day the "principalities and
   powers in heavenly places," which they wrestle withal, to have against
   them; and being herewithal taught that there is neither purpose nor
   promise of God for their preservation, that there is nothing to that
   purpose in the covenant of grace; -- the consideration of their
   condition must of necessity fill them with innumerable perplexities,
   and make them their own tormentors all their days. Thus far, I say, I
   own the objection. That it is not properly courage or confidence, but
   faith, love, and reverence, that are the principles of our actions in
   walking with God, hath been declared.

   But what saith Mr Goodwin to the objection as by himself laid down?
   Besides what he relateth of his conquest of it in other places, he
   addeth, --

   That "the saints, notwithstanding the possibility of their final
   falling away, have, or may have, such an assurance of the perpetuity of
   their standing in the grace and favour of God as may exclude all fear,
   at least that which is of a discouraging or enfeebling nature. The
   apostle, as we have formerly showed, lived at a very excellent rate
   both of courage and confidence, notwithstanding he knew that it was
   possible for him to become a reprobate. The assurance he had, that,
   upon a diligent use of those means which he knew assuredly God would
   vouchsafe unto him, he should prevent his being a reprobate, was a
   golden foundation unto him of that confidence and courage Wherein he
   equalized the holy angels themselves."

   Ans. 1. The grounds asserted by Mr Goodwin on which believers may build
   the assurance pretended, of the perpetuity of their standing in the
   grace and favour of God, notwithstanding the possibility of their
   defection (the assertion whereof costs no less than the denying of all
   or any influence from the purpose, promises, covenant, or oath of God,
   or mediation of Christ, into their preservation), I have formerly
   considered, and manifested them to be so exceeding unable to bear any
   such building of confidence upon as is pretended, that it is almost a
   miracle how any thoughts of such a structure on such quicksands could
   ever find place in the mind of a man any thing seriously acquainted
   with the ways of God. The whole of the saints' preservation in the love
   and favour of God (as it is also expressed in this section) is resolved
   into men's self-considerations and endeavours. Being weary, it seemeth,
   of leaning on the power of God, to be kept thereby unto eternal
   salvation, men begin to trust to themselves and their own abilities to
   be their own keepers; but what will They do in the end thereof? The sum
   of what Mr Goodwin hath formerly said, and what he repeateth again to
   the end of this section, is, "Men need not fear their falling away,
   though it is possible, seeing they may easily prevent it if they will;"
   -- expressions sufficiently contemptive of the grace of God, and the
   salvation that God assureth us thereby; an assertion which those
   ancients which Mr Goodwin laboureth to draw into communion with him
   would have rejected and cast out as heretical. Man's ability thus to
   preserve himself in the grace and favour of God to the end is either
   from himself or from the grace of God? If from himself, let us know
   what that ability is, and wherein it doth consist, and how he comes by
   it. Christ telleth us that" without him we can do nothing;" and the
   apostle, that "we are not sufficient of ourselves to think a good
   thought, but that all our sufficiency is of God:" so that this
   self-ability for preservation extendeth not to the thinking a good
   thought, -- indeed is nothing. Is it from the grace of God? Then the
   assurance of it must be either because God promised absolutely so to
   "work in him both to will and to do of his good pleasure" as that he
   should certainly be preserved; which you will not say, as I suppose, or
   because he will so afford him his grace as that he may make use of it
   to the end proposed if he please. But now what assurance hath he that
   he shall so make use of his grace as to make it effectual for the end
   designed? And is this good use of grace of himself., or of grace also?
   If of himself, it is "nothing," as was showed from that of our Saviour,
   John xv. 5, neither can a man promise himself much assistance from the
   ability of doing nothing at all. If you shall say it is of grace, the
   same question ariseth as formerly, manifesting that there is not the
   least assurance imaginable of our continuance in the grace and favour
   of God, but what ariseth from his faithful promises (efficaciously
   overcoming all interveniencies) that we shall so do.

   2. He telleth us that "Paul lived at an excellent rate of assurance,
   and yet knew that it was possible for him to be a reprobate." I
   confess, indeed, he lived at an excellent rate of assurance, which he
   manifesteth himself to have received upon such principles and
   foundations as were common to him with all true believers, Rom. viii.
   32-35. That it was possible in respect of the event that he might have
   been a reprobate who was chosen from eternity is not proved. He saith,
   indeed, 1 Cor. ix. 27, "I keep under my body, and bring it into
   subjection, lest by any means I should be found adokimos." That by
   adokimos, there, any more is intended than "not approved or accepted"
   in that service he had in hand, Mr Goodwin laboureth not to evince; and
   if that be the sense of the words (as the scope of the whole
   manifesteth it to be), then all that Paul there expresseth is, that he
   endeavoured always to approve himself, and by all means, an acceptable
   workman, not to be rejected or disallowed in the labour of preaching
   the gospel which he had undertaken. And we acknowledge that this
   thought and contrivance may well become him who liveth at the greatest
   rate of assurance that God affordeth to any here below; yea, that such
   thoughts and endeavours do naturally and genuinely flow from the
   assurance of the love of God we also grant. But yet, supposing that
   being a reprobate, by a metonymy of the effect, may here signify to be
   damned, how doth this prove that it was possible in respect of the
   event that he should be damned!" Why, because he laboured that he might
   not be so." That is, no man can use the means of avoiding any thing,
   but he must be uncertain whether in the use of those means it may be
   avoided or no! This looketh like begging the thing in question. Paul,
   labouring and endeavouring in the ways expressed, evidently manifesteth
   such a labour and endeavour, in such a way, to be the appointed means
   of avoiding the condition of being adokimos. That there is an
   infallible connection betwixt the use of such means and the deliverance
   from that state is proved. But that Paul had not assurance of the
   sufficiency of the grace of God with him for his certain use of those
   means, and certain, infallible deliverance from that end, nothing in
   the least is intimated in the text, or brought in from any place else
   by Mr Goodwin, to give colour thereunto. But of this scripture at large
   afterward.

   Supposing himself to have fairly quit himself of the former plea in the
   behalf of our doctrine, as by himself proposed, he addeth other
   pretension in the behalf of the same plea formerly produced, which he
   attempteth also to take out of the way, having in some measure prepared
   it in his proposal of it for an easy removal. Thus, then, he
   proceedeth, "To pretend that, the weakness of the flesh in the Lest of
   saints considered, and their aptness to go astray, they must needs lie
   under many troublesome and tormenting fears of perishing, unless they
   have some promise or assurance from God to support them, that
   notwithstanding any declinings or going astray incident unto them yet
   they shall not lose his favour or perish, is to pretend nothing but
   what hath been thoroughly answered already, especially in chap. ix."

   Ans. Before I can admit this plea to be put in in our behalf, I shall
   crave leave a little to rectify and point it more sharply against the
   doctrine it aimeth to oppose. I say, then, --

   1. It is not the "weakness of the flesh," or the feebleness and
   disability of our natural man to act in, or go through with, great
   duties and trials, but the strength and wilfulness of the flesh, that
   is, of the corrupted man, even in the best of saints, continually
   provoking and seducing them, with sometimes an insuperable efficacy
   leading them captive, and working in them continually with a thousand
   baits and wiles (as hath been in part discovered), labouring to turn
   them aside from God, that fills the saints of God with tormenting,
   perplexing fears of perishing; and must needs do so if they have no
   promise of God for their preservation. Besides all this strength and
   wilfulness of the flesh, they are exposed to the assaults of other most
   dreadful adversaries, "wrestling with principalities and powers in
   heavenly places," and contending with the world as it lieth under the
   curse, all their days. To refer all the oppositions that believers meet
   withal in the course of their obedience, and which may fill them with
   fears that they shall one day perish, if not supported by an almighty
   hand, and "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation," unto
   the "weakness of the flesh," -- which, in the place where the
   expression is used, plainly pointeth at the disability of the natural
   man to abide in and go through with great duties and trials, -- is a
   most vain and empty contemplation. Those who have to do with God in the
   matter of gospel obedience, and know what it is indeed to "serve him
   under temptations," can tell you another manner of story; and among
   them Mr Goodwin could do so to the purpose, if his thoughts were not
   prejudiced by any biassing opinions that must be leaned unto.

   2. We do not say that the saints of God, in the condition mentioned,
   stand in need of any promise of God, that notwithstanding any
   declinings or goings astray incident unto them, they shall not lose his
   favour or perish; but, that they shall have such a presence of his
   Spirit and sufficiency of his grace with them all their days, that they
   shall never, notwithstanding all the oppositions and difficulties they
   meet withal, utterly fail in their faith, nor be prevailed against to
   depart wickedly and utterly from God. And now I see not but that,
   supposing that it is necessary that the saints be delivered from
   troublesome, perplexing fears of perishing, and that God hath made
   provision for that end and purpose (which that he hath seems to be
   granted by our author), -- I say, I cannot see but that this plea
   striketh at the very heart of the apostasy of saints, though not very
   fitly brought in in this place, in reference to the argument that
   occasioned it. But our author, knowing his faculty to lie more in
   evading what is objected against him than in urging arguments for his
   own opinion, doth everywhere, upon the first proposal of any argument,
   divert to other considerations and to the answering of objections,
   though, perhaps, not at all to the plea in hand, nor any way occasioned
   by it. But what saith he, now, in defence of his dearly beloved, thus
   attempted, to vindicate it from this sore imputation of robbing and
   despoiling the saints of God of their peace and assurance, purchased
   for them at no less rate than the blood of the Lord Jesus? He telleth
   you, then, three things:--

   1. "That the weakness of the flesh, or aptness of miscarrying through
   this, is no reasonable ground of fear to any true believer of his
   perishing, considering that no man loseth or forfeiteth the grace and
   favour of God through sins of weakness or infirmity. It is only the
   strength of sin and corruption in men that exposeth to the danger of
   losing the love of God."

   Ans. The latter part of these words plainly discovers the vanity of the
   former, as produced for any such end and purpose as that in hand: for
   though I willingly grant that that which is termed "The weakness of the
   flesh" is enough to make any man whatever fear that he shall not hold
   out in the course of his obedience to the end, if he have no promise of
   supportment and preservation by an almighty power (notwithstanding it
   is affirmed that it draweth men only to "sins of weakness or
   infirmity," which I thought had not been called so from weakness of the
   flesh, but of grace in believers), yet it is the strength, the power,
   the law, the subtlety of the flesh, or indwelling sin, that is the
   matter of our plea in this case; not that which Paul "gloried in," even
   his "infirmity," but that which made him cry out, "O wretched man that
   I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" and from the
   distress by reason whereof he found no deliverance, but only in the
   assured love of God in Jesus Christ, Rom. vii., viii. 1. So that
   notwithstanding this reply, shaped to fortify the minds of men against
   their failings upon the account of the weakness of grace, rather than
   of the flesh (which yet it is not able to do, for if there be no
   promise to the contrary, why may not the principle which carrieth men
   forth to lesser carry them also forth to greater and more provoking
   sins? what boundaries will you prescribe unto these sins of
   infirmity?), the pretension from the strength of the flesh (yea, from
   the weakness of it) holdeth good against the saints' establishment in
   peace and assurance, upon the account of their being destitute of any
   promise of preservation by God.

   2. "If the saints be willing," saith he, "to strengthen the Spirit in
   them, and make him willing proportionably to the means prescribed and
   vouchsafed unto them by God for such a purpose, this will fully balance
   the weakness of the flesh, and prevent the miscarriages and breaking
   out hereof. This, I say, then,' saith the apostle, walk in the Spirit,
   and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.' And again, If ye be
   led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law,' and consequently are in
   no danger of losing the favour of God, or of perishing for such sins
   which, under the conduct of the Spirit, ye are subject unto."

   Ans. But that all now must be taken in good part, and nothing called
   strange or uncouth, since we have passed the pikes in the last section,
   I should somewhat admire at the doctrine of this paragraph; for, --

   (1.) Here is a willing, in reference to a great spiritual duty,
   supposed in men antecedent to any assistance of Him who "worketh both
   to will and to do of his good pleasure." What he worketh, he worketh by
   the Spirit; but this is a willing in us distinct from and antecedent to
   the appearing of the Spirit, for the strengthening thereof.

   (2.) That whereas we have hitherto imagined that the Spirit
   strengtheneth the saints, and that their supportment had been from him,
   as we partly also before declared (at least we did our mind to be so
   persuaded), it seemeth they "strengthen the Spirit in them," and not he
   them! How, or by what means, or by what principles in them, it is that
   so they do is not declared. Besides, what is here intended by "the
   Spirit" is not manifested. If it be the holy and blessed Spirit of God,
   he hath no need of our strengthening; he is able of himself to "make us
   meet for the inheritance of the saints in light," If it be the gracious
   principles that are bestowed upon the saints that are intended, the
   "new creature," the "inward man," called "the Spirit" in the Scripture,
   in opposition to "the flesh;" if our strengthening this Spirit be any
   thing but the acting of the graces intended thereby in us, I know not
   what you mean. Especially, in what is or consists their acting to make
   "the Spirit willing proportionably to the means we do receive," am I to
   seek. To say that we receive outward means of God (for so they must be,
   being distinguished from the Spirit), and thereupon of ourselves do
   make the Spirit willing, and strengthen him to the performance of God,
   surely holds out a very sufficient power in spiritual things inbred in
   us and abiding with us, whereof there is not the least line or
   appearance in the whole book of God, nor in any author urged by Mr
   Goodwin to give countenance to his persuasion.

   (3.) Neither is the sum of all this answer any other but this: "If we
   are willing, and will prevent all miscarriages from the weakness of the
   flesh, we may." But how we become willing so to do, and what assurance
   we have that we shall be so willing, seeing all in us by nature as to
   any spiritual duty is flesh, is not intimated in the least, John iii.
   6. This is strenuously supposed all along, that to be willing unto
   spiritual good in a spiritual manner is wholly in our own power; and an
   easy thing it is, no doubt, The plea in hand is: Such is the strength
   of indwelling sin in the best of the saints, and so easily doth it
   beset them, that if they have not some promise of God to assure them
   that they shall have constant supply of grace from him, and by his
   power be preserved, it is impossible but that they must be filled with
   perplexing fears that they shall not hold out in giving him willing
   obedience to the end, their will being in an especial manner entangled
   with the power of sin. It is answered, "If men be but willing, etc.,
   they need not fear this or any such issue;" that is, "If they do the
   thing which they fear, and have reasons invincible to fear, that they
   shall not, they need not fear but that they shall do it;" which is
   nothing but an absurd begging of the thing in question. Neither is
   there any thing in the Scripture that will give a pass to this beggar,
   or shelter him from due correction. The apostle, indeed, saith, that if
   we "walk in the Spirit, we shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh." And
   good reason there is for it; for, as he told us, these are contrary to
   one another, and opposite to one another, and bring forth such diverse
   and contrary fruits in them in whom they are, that if we walk in the
   one we shall, not fulfil the lusts of the other. But what assurance
   have we that we shall "walk in the Spirit," if it be not hence, that
   God bath promised that "his Spirit shall never depart from us?" And he
   saith, "If we are led by the Spirit we are not under the law;" which,
   by the way, letteth us see that the Spirit leadeth us, -- that is,
   maketh us willing, and strengtheneth us, not we him. But on what
   account shall or dare any man promise to himself that the Spirit will
   continue so to do, if God hath not promised that he shall so do? or, if
   his leading of us be only on condition that we be willing to be led,
   how shall we be in the least ascertained (supposing us in any measure
   acquainted with the power of indwelling sin) that we shall be always so
   willing? Let, then, this pass with what was said before, as nothing to
   the thing in hand.

   3. "It is answered, then (thirdly and lastly), there is no such aptness
   or proneness unto sin, -- sins, I mean, of a disinheriting import, --
   in saints or true believers, as is pretended; but, on the contrary, a
   strong propension or inclination unto righteousness reigneth in them.
   We heard formerly from the apostle,1 John iii. 9, that he that is born
   of God cannot sin;' and also from 1 John v. 18. From these
   suppositions, with many other of like import, it is evident that there
   is a pregnant, strong, overpowering propension in all true believers to
   walk holily and to live righteously: so that to refrain sinning in the
   kind intended is no such great mastery, no such matter of difficulty,
   unto such men; and that when they are overcome and fall into sin, it is
   through a mere voluntary neglect. And thus we see, all things
   impartially weighed and debated to and fro, that the doctrine which
   supposeth a possibility of the saints' declining is the doctrine which
   is according to godliness,' and the corrival of it an enemy thereto."

   Ans. We, have here an assertion, an inference, and a conclusion. The
   assertion is, that "there is no such aptness and proneness to sin in
   believers as is intimated," and that "because there is such a strong
   propensity in them to righteousness," which that they have is proved
   from sundry places of Scripture. That is, because the Spirit is in
   believers, the flesh is not in them; because they have a new man in
   them, they have not an old; because they have a principle of life, they
   have not a body of death. That is, where the Spirit lusteth against the
   flesh, the flesh lusteth not against the Spirit. We thought the
   doctrine of Paul, Rom. vii., Gal. v. 17, and in innumerable other
   places, with the experience of all the saints in the world, had lain
   against this piece of sophistry. It is true, their propension unto
   righteousness reigneth in them, but it is as true their propension unto
   sin rebelleth in them. Though the land be conquered for Christ, yet the
   Canaanites will dwell in it; and if the saints leave off but one day
   the work of killing, crucifying, and mortifying, they will quickly find
   an actual rebellion in them not easy to be suppressed. They have,
   indeed, a propension to holiness ruling in them, but also a propension
   unto sin dwelling in them; so that "when they would do good, evil is
   present with them, and the good they would do they cannot." But when Mr
   Goodwin can prove this consequence, that saints have strong
   inclinations to righteousness, therefore they have not so to sin, for
   my part I will forbear for ever disputing with him. If he can beat us,
   not only from Scripture, but from all our spiritual sense and
   experience, doubtless it is to no purpose to contend any longer with
   him. Hence, then, --

   He inferreth that "to abstain from sinning," -- that is, sinning
   customarily and against conscience, so as to endanger the loss of the
   favour of God, -- "is no such great mastery, no such matter of
   difficulty, to such men." This abstaining from such sins on the one
   hand is the whole course of our gospel obedience; which, it seemeth,
   however it be compared to "running in a race," "striving for
   masteries," and be called "resisting unto blood," "wrestling with
   principalities and powers," and requiring for its carrying on "the
   exceeding greatness of the power of God," with suitable "help in time
   of need" from Jesus Christ, who is sensible of the weight of it, as no
   small matter, knowing' what it is to "serve God in temptations," yet is
   it indeed but a trifling thing, a matter of no great difficulty or
   mastery. Do men watch, pray, contend, fight, wrestle with God and
   Satan? Doth the Lord put forth his power, and the Lord Jesus Christ
   continually intercede, for the preservation of the saints? "Ad quid
   perditio hæc?" To what end is all this toil and labour about a thing of
   little or no weight? "Egregiam vero laudem!" We know, indeed, the "yoke
   of Christ is easy, and his commandments not grievous; that we can do
   all things through him that enableth us:" but to make gospel obedience
   so slight a thing that it is no great mastery, or matter of no great
   commendation to hold out in it to the end, this we were to learn till
   now, and are as yet slow of heart to receive it.

   The conclusion is, "Iö, Pæan, vicimus." "All things impartially
   weighed, the case is ours, and godliness exceedingly promoted by the
   doctrine of the possibility of the saints' defection (Hoper edei
   deixai), and the corrival of it an enemy to it;" -- to prove which not
   one word in the argument hath been spoken, nor to free the other from a
   charge of a direct contrary importance, one word to the purpose. And of
   Mr Goodwin's sixth argument for his doctrine of the apostasy of saints,
   this is the end.

   But this is not all he hath to say in this case in hand. Indeed the
   main design of his whole 13th chapter, consisting of forty-one
   sections, and about so many pages in his book, and containing all
   which, in an argumentative way, he insisteth on in the case in hand,
   looketh this way; and therefore, having already plucked away one of the
   main props of that discourse, I shall apply myself to take away those
   which do remain, that the whole may justly fall to the ground, and
   therefore shall, as briefly as I can, consider the whole of that
   discourse, containing nine arguments against the perseverance of
   saints, for the possibility of their total and final defection.

   It will be needless to use many words unto the discourse of the first
   section, seeing it will not in the least prejudice our cause in hand to
   leave Mr Goodwin in full possession of all the glory of the rhetoric
   thereof; for although I cannot close with him in the exposition given
   of that expression, 1 Tim. vi. 16, "God inhabiteth light inaccessible,"
   something, in my weak apprehension, much more glorious and divine being
   comprised therein than what it is here turned aside unto (neither am I
   in the least convinced of the truth tes apodoseos of the former
   discourse, in the close of the whole, asserting a deliverance to be
   obtained from our thoughts of the doctrine of the defection of the
   saints, which he intimateth to be [evangelical], that it is
   anti-evangelical, tormenting, and bringing souls under bondage, by a
   narrow and unprejudicate search into it, finding myself every day more
   and more confirmed in thoughts of that kind concerning it by my
   engagement into such an inquiry, which hath been observed in this
   present discourse as far as my weakness will permit), yet it being not
   in the least argumentative, but, for the whole frame and intendment of
   it, commune exordium, and that which any man of any opinion in the
   world might make use of, I shall not insist upon it.

   His second section containeth his first argument, drawn forth in the
   defence of his doctrine of the "possibility" (as he calleth it, but
   indeed what it is we have heard) "of the defection of believers." Of
   this I presume he intended no more use but (as a forlorn) to begin a
   light skirmish with his adversaries, ordering it to retreat to his main
   body advancing after, or desperately casting it away, to abate the edge
   of his combatants' weapons, it is so weak and feeble; and therefore I
   shall be very brief in the consideration of it. Thus, then, he
   proposeth it:--

   "That doctrine which rendereth God free from the unrighteousness which
   the Scripture calleth the respecting of persons of men, is a doctrine
   of perfect consistence with the Scripture and the truth; the doctrine
   which teacheth the possibility of the saints' declining, and this unto
   death, is a doctrine of this import: ergo."

   Ans. The first proposition must be supposed universal, or else the
   whole will quickly be manifested to be unconclusive. If it be only
   indefinite, and so equivalent, as it lieth, to a particular, the
   conclusion is from all particulars, and of no force, as Mr Goodwin well
   knoweth. Take it universally, and I say it is evidently false, and
   might easily be disproved by innumerable instances. Not that any error
   or falsehood can indeed give God the glory of any one of his
   attributes, but that they may be fitted and suited for such a service,
   were not their throats cut and their mouths stopped by the lies that
   are in them; which Mr Goodwin's doctrine is no less liable to than any
   other, and not at all exempted from that condition by its seeming
   subserviency unto God's aprosopolepsia. Doth not the doctrine of
   justification by works, even in the most rind sense of it, according to
   the tenor of the old covenant, absolutely render God free from the
   unrighteousness of accepting of persons? and yet, for all that, it hath
   not one jot the more of truth in it, nor is it the less
   and-evangelical. This foundation, then, being removed, whatever is
   built upon it mole ruit suâ. Neither is it in any measure restored or
   laid anew by the reason of it given by Mr Goodwin, namely, "That the
   Scripture affirmeth in sundry places that God is no accepter of
   persons;" for he that shall hence conclude that whatever doctrine
   affirmeth, directly or by consequence, that God is no accepter of
   persons, whatever other abomination it is evidently teeming withal, is
   yet true and according to the mind of God, shall have leave,
   notwithstanding the antiquated statute of our university against it, to
   go and read logic at Stamford. On this account do but prove that a
   doctrine be not guilty of any one crime, and you may conclude that it
   is guilty of none. For instance, that doctrine which impeacheth not the
   omnipresence of the Deity is true and according to the Scripture, for
   the Scripture aboundeth with clear testimonies of the presence of God
   in all places; now the doctrine of the ubiquity of the human nature of
   Christ doth no way impeach the omnipresence of the Deity: therefore it
   is true and according to Scripture!

   I might supersede all farther considerations of this argument, having
   rendered it altogether useless and unserviceable in this warfare by
   breaking its right leg, or rather crutch, whereon it leaned. But
   something also may be added to the minor, because of its reflection in
   the close of its proof upon the doctrine we maintain, intimating an
   inconsistency of it with that excellency of God spoken of, namely, that
   he is no accepter of persons.

   Prosopolepsia, or accepting of persons, is an evil in judgment, when he
   who is to determine in causes of righteousness hath respect to personal
   things, that concern not the merit of the cause in hand, and judgeth
   accordingly. This properly can have no place in God as to any bestowing
   of free grace, mercy, or pardon. There is room made for it only when
   the things that are bestowed or wrought by it are such as in justice
   are due; it being an iniquity solely and directly opposed to
   distributive justice, that rendereth to every one according to what is
   righteous and due. [207] That with God there be no accepting of persons
   there is no more required but this, that he appoint and determine equal
   punishments to equal faults, and give equal rewards to equal
   deservings. If he will dispose of his pardoning mercy and free grace to
   some in Christ, not to others, who shall say unto him, "What doest
   thou?' May he not do what he will with his own? So he giveth a penny to
   him that laboureth all day, he may give a penny also to him that
   worketh but one hour. Now, suppose that Mr Goodwin's doctrine render
   God free from this (or rather chargeth him not with it), yet if withal
   it calleth his truth, righteousness, faithfulness, oath, and
   immutability into question, shall it pass for a truth, or be embraced
   ever the sooner?

   But the sting of this argument lieth in the tail or close of it, in the
   reflection insisted on upon the common doctrine of perseverance, as it
   is called, namely, that it teacheth God to be an accepter of persona
   This is Mr Goodwin's way of arguing all along: When at any time he hath
   proposed a proof of the doctrine he goeth about to establish, finding
   that as something heavy work to lie upon his hand, and not much to be
   said in the case, he instantly turneth about and falleth upon his
   adversaries, in declaiming against whom he hath a rich and overflowing
   vein. There is scarce any one of his arguments in the pursuit and
   improvement whereof one fourth part of it is spoken to that head
   wherein he is engaged.

   But wherein is the "common doctrine of perseverance" guilty of this
   great crime? It teacheth that "he that believeth shall be saved, and he
   that believeth not shall be damned." It teacheth that God hath allotted
   equal punishments to equal transgressions, and appointed equal rewards
   to equal ways of obedience; that the wages of every sin is death, and
   that every sinner must die, unless it be those concerning whom God
   himself saith, "Deliver them, I have found a ransom," Job xxxiii. 24;
   that he is alike displeased with sin in whomsoever it is, and that in a
   peculiar and eminent manner when it is found in his own. Indeed, if
   this be to impute acceptation of persons to God, to say "that he hath
   mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth," --
   that is, is tender to his own, as a father to his only child that
   serveth him, and will recover them (being faithful in his promises)
   from their sins, and heal their backslidings, though he suffer others
   to lie wallowing in their rebellions and pollutions all their days; --
   that he will not give pardon to any sinner but upon faith and
   repentance, but will give faith and repentance to those whom he hath
   chosen, and given unto Jesus Christ to be saved: if this, I say, be
   acceptance of persons, our doctrine owneth the imputation of ascribing
   it to God, and glorieth in it, we being ascertained that God taketh all
   this to himself clearly and plentifully in the word of truth.

   The sum of what our author gives in to make good his charge upon the
   "common doctrine of perseverance" is, that it affirmeth "That though
   saints and believers fall into the same sins of adultery, and idolatry,
   and the like, with other men, yet they are not dealt withal as other
   men, but continued in the love and favour of God." To waive the
   consideration of the false impositions, by the way, on the doctrine
   opposed (as that is, that it teacheth the saints to fall into and to
   continue in them, to the significancy of that expression "Never so
   long," under abominations), and to join issue upon the whole of the
   matter, I say, --

   1. That in and with this doctrine, and in perfect harmony and
   consistency therewith, we maintain that the judgment of God is the same
   in respect of every sin, in whomsoever it is, that he that doth it on
   that account is "worthy of death," Rom. i. 32. And, --

   2. That the sentence of the law is the same towards all, cursing every
   one that continueth not in all things written in the book thereof to do
   them, Deut. xxvii. 26.

   3. That in and under the gospel, wherein a remedy is provided in
   reference to the rigour and severity of both the former apprehensions,
   yet the Judge of all dealeth with all men equally, according to the
   tenor of it, "He that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth
   not shall be damned." Men in the same condition shall have the same
   recompense of reward. But you will say, "Do not the same sins put men
   into the same condition, and deserve the same punishment in one as in
   another?"

   Ans. 1. They do deserve the same punishment. God is equally provoked;
   and had not Christ answered for the sins of believers, they could not,
   they should not, have escaped the wrath due to them. 2. That the same
   sins do not argue men always, under the gospel, to be in the same
   condition, as shall be afterward fully manifested; for, First, they do
   not find them in the same state. Some are in a state of death and sin,
   others of life and grace, being translated from the one to the other,
   having a title to the promise of mercy in Christ. Secondly, and
   chiefly, as there is a twofold justification, of the person and of the
   fact, and the one may be without the other, so there is a twofold
   condemnation, of disapprobation of the fact and of the person. As to
   the particular disapprobation of God in respect of any sinful act, it
   is the same in reference unto all persons, believers and unbelievers.
   As to their persons, there are in the gospel other ingredients to the
   judgment of them beside particular facts or acts, in answer to the law
   or the rule of righteousness, -- namely, faith and repentance, -- which
   alter the case of the person, even before the judgment-seat of God. To
   suppose the saints to fall into the same sins with other men in the
   same manner, and to continue in them without faith and repentance, is
   to beg the thing in question. Suppose them to have (what we affirm God
   hath promised) those conditions of evangelical mercy, and Mr Goodwin
   himself will grant it no acceptance of persons to deal otherwise with
   them than with others who have committed like sins with them in whom
   those conditions are not wrought or found; that is, "He that believeth
   shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be damned." This is all we
   say in this thing. But of the difference between believers and
   unbelievers in their sinning we shall speak afterward at large, to the
   full removal of this and another objection. For the present this shall
   suffice: Though believers fall, or may fall, into the same sins with
   other men, yet they fall not into them in the same manner with them,
   and they have a relief provided to prevent the deadly malignity of sin,
   which those who believe not have no interest in nor right unto.

   Mr Goodwin's second argument is that which, of all others in this case,
   he seemeth to lay most weight upon, and which he pursueth at large in
   seventeen pages and as many sections, treating in it concerning the
   ministry of the gospel, and the usefulness of the exhortations,
   threatenings, and promises thereof. For an entrance into the
   consideration of it, I must needs say, "Non venit ex pharetris ista
   sagitta tuis." For besides that Mr Goodwin hath taken very little pains
   in the improvement of it (considering how it was provided to his hand
   by the Remonstrants at the Synod of Dort, and that which he hath done
   farther consisting in a mere useless and needless stuffing of it with
   sundry notions taken out of their first argument and fifth, "De modo
   conversionis," of the manner of the Spirit's operation in and upon the
   soul in its first conversion to God), it was the old song of the
   Pelagians and semi-Pelagians in their dealing with Austin, Fulgentius,
   Hilarius, Prosper, and by them at large confuted; renewed by Castalio
   and Erasmus against Luther, after it had been sifted and rejected by
   the more learned schoolmen in former ages. Whatever it be, and however
   it is now come to hand, being taught to speak our language, and that in
   the best fashion, the consideration of it must not be declined. And
   thus it is proposed:--

   "If the common doctrine of perseverance rendereth the ministry of the
   gospel, so far as it concerneth the perseverance of the saints, vain,
   impertinent, and void, then is it not a doctrine of God, but of men,
   and consequently that which opposeth it is truth; but certain it is
   that the said doctrine is of this unchristian tendency and import:
   ergo." The first part of the consequent of the major is granted. The
   work of the ministry being for the "perfecting of the saints, and the
   edification of the body of Christ," Eph. iv. 12, 13, that which
   frustrateth the end whereunto of Christ himself it is designed can be
   no truth of his. Of the farther inference, that the doctrine which
   opposeth it, or is set up in opposition to it, is the truth, more will
   be spoken afterward. For the present, I cannot but insist upon the
   former observation, that, notwithstanding Mr Goodwin's pretence of
   proving and arguing for the doctrine he maintains, yet upon the matter
   he hath not any thing to say in the carrying on of that design, but
   instantly falls to his old work of raising objections, -- in their very
   setting up prepared to be cast down, for the most part, -- which with
   all his might he labours to remove.

   The stress of the whole, as far as we are concerned in it, lieth on the
   minor, which is thus farther attempted to be made good. The minor
   proposition is demonstrated thus: "The doctrine which rendereth the
   labour and faithfulness of a minister, in pressing such exhortations,
   threatenings, and promises, which tend to the preservation of the
   saints in faith and holiness to the end, useless, rendereth the
   ministry of the gospel, as far as it concerneth the encouragement or
   enabling of the saints to persevere, needless and vain; but guilty of
   such a tendency as this is the commonly received doctrine of
   perseverance: ergo."

   Ans. This labour might have been saved, and both these syllogisms very
   easily reduced to one; but then another seeming argument, afterward, as
   we shall find, insisted on, would have been prevented. Our trade in
   such cases as this is by weight, and not by number. The minor, then, is
   still to be confirmed, which he laboureth thus to do:--

   "The common doctrine of perseverance requireth and commandeth all
   saints or believers to be fully persuaded, and this with the greatest
   and most indubitable certainty of faith, that there is an absolute and
   utter impossibility either of a total or a final defection of their
   faith, -- that though they should fall into ten thousand enormous and
   most abominable sins, and lie wallowing in them, like swine in the
   mire, yet they should remain all the while in an estate of grace, and
   that God will, by a strong hand of irresistible grace, break them off
   from their sins by repentance before they die; but the doctrine which
   requireth and commandeth all this, and much more of like import, to be
   confidently believed by true believers, rendereth the pressing of all
   exhortations, threatenings, promises upon them, in order to prevail
   with them, or to make them carefully to persevere, bootless and
   unnecessary: ergo."

   Ans. What weight Mr Goodwin, with all those with whom, as to his
   undertaking under consideration, he is in fellowship, doth lay upon
   this argument is known to all. The whole foundation of what is
   afterward at large insisted on, for the establishment of it, being laid
   upon the proof of the minor proposition formerly denied, here laid
   down, it will easily be granted that it was incumbent on him to make
   sure work here, and not to leave any thing liable to any just
   exception. An error or a mistake in the foundation is not easily
   recoverable All that is afterward heaped up beareth itself on a
   supposition of the truth of what is here delivered. If this fail in the
   least, we may spare our labour as to any farther consideration of what
   followeth. Now, the main of the proof here insisted on lieth in the
   declaration of that which he calleth the "common doctrine of
   perseverance;" and concerning this he informeth his reader, --

   "That it commandeth all saints to be fully persuaded, and that with the
   greatest and most indubitable certainty of faith, that there is an
   absolute and utter impossibility either of a total or final defection
   of their faith."

   Ans. What is the intendment of these aggravating expressions of "Fully
   persuaded," "Greatest and most indubitable certainty of faith," I know
   not. Will it please you if it should require them to be persuaded, but
   not fully persuaded; to believe it, but with little and dubitable
   certainty of faith, or uncertainty rather? Full persuasion, greatest
   certainty, without doubting or staggering, are all of them perfections
   of faith and of the saints in believing; which without doubt they are,
   in all that they are to believe, to press after. So that all this is no
   more but that this doctrine requireth men to believe what it affirmeth
   God to have promised. It requireth men to mix the promises of God with
   faith, crimen inauditum. "But though the manner of believing which it
   requireth be not blamable, yet the thing which it proposeth to be
   believed is false." What is that? "That there is an absolute or utter
   impossibility either of a total or final defection of the faith of true
   believers." Its requiring this to be believed is the bottom and also
   cornerstone of Mr Goodwin's ensuing argument. If it doth not do this,
   he hath nothing in this place to say to it. Let him, then, produce any
   one that hath ever wrote in the defence of it, that hath in terms, or
   by just consequence, delivered any such thing, and, en herbam! there
   shall be an end of this dispute. I presume Mr Goodwin knoweth what is
   meant by "an absolute and utter impossibility." An absolute repugnancy
   unto being, in the nature of the things themselves concerning which any
   affirmation is, and not any external or foreign consideration, doth
   entitle any thing to [be called] an absolute and utter impossibility.
   Did ever any one affirm that, in the nature of the thing itself, the
   defection of the saints is absolutely impossible? Is it not by them
   that believe the perseverance of the saints constantly affirmed that in
   themselves they are apt, yea, prone to fall away, and their faith to
   decay and diet which in itself possibly may be done, though Mr Goodwin
   cannot tolerably show how. The whole certainty of their continuance in,
   and of the preservation of, their faith, depends merely on supposition
   of something that is extrinsical in respect of them and of their state,
   which, as to their condition, might or might not be. Farther, the
   perseverance of the saints is by the same persons constantly affirmed
   to be carried on and to be perfected in and by the use of means. It is
   their keeping by the power of God through faith unto salvation." And
   can, then, an absolute impossibility of their defection be asserted, or
   only that which is so upon supposition, -- namely, of the purpose of
   God, etc.? There was no absolute impossibility that the hones of Christ
   should be broken, they being in themselves as liable to be broken as
   his flesh to be pierced; yet in respect of the event it was impossible
   they should be so. I cannot well imagine that Mr Goodwin is not fully
   persuaded, with the greatest and most indubitable certainty that a
   persuasion in things of this kind will admit, that the "common doctrine
   of perseverance" doth not require saints to believe that there is "an
   absolute impossibility of their defection," but only that God hath
   promised to preserve them from that which in themselves and in respect
   of any thing in them they are obnoxious unto, in and by the use of the
   means suited and appointed by him to the carrying on of that work and
   compassing of the end proposed. But yet it pleaseth him here to make
   show of a contrary apprehension; and to show his confidence therein he
   aggravates it with this annexed supposition and case: "It doth so,"
   saith he, "though they should fall into ten thousand enormous and most
   abominable sins, and lie wallowing in them like swine in the mire, yet
   that they shall remain all the while in an estate of grace."

   Ans. Truly this is such an enormous and an abominable calumny that I
   cannot but admire how any sober and rational man durst venture upon the
   owning of it. The question now is, what faith the doctrine insisted on
   ingenerates in particular persons, that should enervate and make void
   the exhortations, etc., of the ministry? Now, though the doctrine
   should teach this indefinitely, that though men did sin so and so, as
   is here expressed, yet they should be kept in state of grace, as is
   mentioned (which yet is loudly and palpably false, as hath been
   declared), yet that it doth require particular men to believe for
   themselves, and in reference to the guidance of their own ways, that
   they may "lie and wallow in their sin, like swine in the mire, and yet
   continue in a state of grace and acceptation with God," is so
   notoriously contrary to the whole tenor of the doctrine, the genius and
   nature of it, with all the arguments whereby it is asserted and
   maintained, that if conscience had but in the least been advised withal
   in this contest, this charge had been without doubt omitted. All that
   is produced for the confirmation of this strange imposition on the
   persuasion under consideration is his own testimony that makes the
   charge, "that it is the known voice of the common doctrine of
   perseverance;" and that being said is laid as a foundation of all that
   follows, the whole discourse still relating to a supposition that this
   is the doctrine which it opposeth, from the very next words to the end!
   Nor is there the least farther attempt for the confirmation of this
   grand assertion. But is this "the known voice" of our doctrine of
   perseverance? Who ever heard it but Mr Goodwin, and men of the like
   prejudicate spirit against the truth? The worst that can be charged
   with looking this way is its asserting the promised efficacy of the
   grace of God for the preserving of believers, by the use of means, from
   such wallowing in abominable sins as is supposed that it affirms they
   may be exposed unto. In brief, it says not, -- first, That all
   believers are certain of their perseverance; nor, secondly, That any
   one can be certain of it upon such supposals as are here mentioned, --
   such a persuasion would not be from Him that calls them; nor, thirdly,
   That the end can be obtained without the use of means, though by them
   it shall certainly be so; but, fourthly, That all the hope of their
   perseverance is built on the promises of God to preserve them by and in
   the use of means. So that, in truth, there is no need of any farther
   process for the removing of the argument insisted on but only a
   disclaimer of the doctrine by it opposed, if it be that which is here
   expressed.

   That, indeed, which Mr Goodwin hath to dispute against, if he will deal
   fairly and candidly in the carrying on of his design, is this:-- "That
   the certainty of an end, to be obtained by means suited thereunto, doth
   not enervate nor render vain the use of those means appointed for the
   accomplishment of that end." The perseverance of the saints is the
   thing here proposed to be accomplished. That this shall be certainly
   effected and brought about, according to the promises of God for the
   effecting of it, God hath appointed the means under debate, to be
   managed by the ministry of the gospel. That the promise of God
   concerning the saints' perseverance, to be wrought and effected, as by
   others, so by these means in their kind, doth not invalidate or render
   useless and vain the use of those means, but indeed establishes them,
   and ascribes to them their proper efficacy, is that which in this
   doctrine is asserted, and which Mr Goodwin ought to have disproved if
   he would have acquitted himself as a fair antagonist in this cause. The
   promise, we say, that Hezekiah had of the continuance of his life, did
   not make useless, but called for, the "plaster of figs" that was
   appointed for the healing of his sore, Isa. xxxviii. 5, 21.

   I might then, as I said, save myself the labour of farther engaging for
   the casting down of this fabric, built on the sandy foundations of
   falsehood and mistake; but because something may fall in of that which
   followeth, -- more indeed to the purpose than an orderly pursuit of
   those assertions laid down in the entrance would require, -- that may
   more directly rise up against the cause in whose defence I am engaged,
   I shall consider the whole ensuing discourse; which, without doubt,
   will administer farther occasion for the illustration or confirmation
   of the truth in hand. He proceeds, then:--

   "The reason of the minor is, because a certain knowledge and persuasion
   that God will, by an irresistible hand of power, preserve a man in the
   state of grace, how desperately careless, negligent, or wicked soever
   he shall be, clearly dissolves the usefulness and necessity of all
   other means whatsoever in reference to this end. If know certainly that
   the corn which I have sown in my field will, whether I wake or sleep,
   grow and prosper, would it not be a very impertinent address for any
   man to come to me, and admonish me in a serious and grave manner to
   take heed I sleep not, but keep myself waking, lest my corn should not
   grow and prosper, or that it may grow and prosper? If my corn grows,
   thrives, and prospers, by the irresistible hand of God, by the course
   of a natural and standing providence, my watchfulness in order to a
   procurement of these things is absolutely vain," etc.

   Ans. That this is not the doctrine which Mr Goodwin hath undertaken to
   oppose, hath been more than once already declared. That he is not able
   with any colour of reason to oppose it, unless he first impose his own
   false and vain inferences upon it, and them upon his reader, for the
   doctrine itself, from his constant course of proceeding against it, is
   also evident. What advantage this is like in the close to prove to his
   cause, in the judgment of considerate men, the event will discover. The
   assertion of the stability of the promises of God in Jesus Christ given
   to believers, concerning his effectual preserving them to the end from
   such sins as are absolutely inconsistent with his grace and favour
   according to the tenor of the new covenant, or such continuance in any
   sin as is of the same importance, by his Spirit and grace, in the use
   of means, doth no way tend to the begetting in any a certain knowledge,
   assurance, and persuasion, that God will continue them in a state of
   grace, "how desperately careless or wicked soever they shall be."

   What is intended by the frequent repetition of this gross sophistry, or
   what success with the intelligent Christian ponderers of things he can
   hope for thereby, I am not able to guess; neither is any improvement in
   the least given to what the intendment of this argument is, so far as
   the "common doctrine of perseverance" is concerned therein, from the
   comparison ensuing instituted between the growth of corn and the
   walking of believers in obedience before God: for notwithstanding the
   identity in respect of the comparison of that expression
   "irresistible," which indeed is proper to neither, there is a wide
   difference between the growing of corn in a mere natural way, and the
   moral actings of an intelligent, rational creature. Whatever operations
   of God are about and in the one or the other, yet they are suited to
   the subjects about which they are. God carries on the growth of corn by
   a way of natural and necessary causes; but his acting of rational
   agents is by such ways and means as may entirely preserve their
   liberty, -- that is, preserving them in their being, and leaving them
   to be such agents. As, then, God causeth the corn to grow by the
   shining of his sun and the falling of his rain, so he causeth believers
   to persevere in obedience by exhortations, promises, and threatenings,
   and such ways and means as are suited to such agents as they are. The
   fallacy of this discourse lies in an insinuation that God, by his
   effectual (or, as they are called, "irresistible") operations for the
   preservation of believers in gospel obedience (a thing he hath
   undertaken over and over to perform) doth change their nature, and
   render them, not free and intelligent agents, fit to be wrought upon by
   the proposal of suitable and desirable objects to their understandings,
   but mere brute and natural principles of all operations flowing from
   them; a conceit as gross and ridiculous as certainly destructive to all
   the efficacy of the grace of God. All the rest of this section, as far
   as it concerns us, is only an affirming, this way and that, that an
   assurance of the end to be obtained by the use of means renders those
   means altogether useless; which when he proves, the controversy may be
   nearer to an issue than otherwise he hath any reason to hope that it
   is, or will be to his advantage.

   Sect. 4. Leaving the farther confirmation of his argument, he enters
   upon the removal of a plea insisted on to the justification of the
   doctrine opposed, and vindication of it from the crime wherewith here
   by him it is charged. This he tells you is, "That the exhortations,
   comminations, and promises spoken of, are means appointed of God for
   the accomplishing and effecting of the perseverance of the saints,
   which he hath made simply and absolutely necessary by his decree."
   "This," he saith, "hath neither any logical nor theological virtue in
   it for the purpose for which it is produced, but is a notion irrelative
   to the business, the accommodation whereof it pretends."

   Ans. It may be so. Suffer you to frame the objection, and who will
   doubt of your ability of giving an answer? But who, I pray, says that
   "God, by his decree, hath made the perseverance of the saints simply
   and absolutely necessary?" That it is certain in respect of the event,
   from the decree of God, we grant; but do we thereby overthrow the means
   whereby it is to be accomplished? yea, we establish them. We are of the
   mind that God hath purposed, and thereupon promised, the accomplishment
   of many things (as the selling of Joseph into Egypt, the bringing of
   the children of Israel from thence, and the like), which yet were to be
   carried on to their accomplishment and brought about through
   innumerable contingencies, by the free, rational, deliberative actings
   of men. If by "Simply and absolutely necessary" you intend that the
   thing decreed is to be wrought of men simply and absolutely necessarily
   by their operations, as to the manner of them, we simply and absolutely
   deny any such decree. If by those expressions you improperly intend
   only the certainty of the event, or accomplishment of the thing
   decreed, with respect to the means appointed and fitted thereunto, we
   say this establisheth those means; neither have they the nature of
   means to an end from any reason whatever, but as so appointed of God
   thereunto. But he proceeds in the proof of his former assertion, and
   says, --

   "First, That the exhortations whereby the saints are exhorted to
   perseverance are no means by which the promises of perseverance made,
   as our adversaries suppose, to them are accomplished or effected, is
   thus clearly evinced: Whatsoever is a means for the bringing of any
   thing to pass ought not to contain any thing in it repugnant or
   contrary unto that which is intended to be brought to pass by it, for
   means ought to be subordinate to their ends, not repugnant; but the
   Scripture exhortations unto perseverance contain that which is
   repugnant to the promises of perseverance, if supposed such as our
   adversaries suppose them to be: therefore they can by no means effect
   those promises. The minor is evident by the light of this
   consideration. Such exhortations as these to the saints, Take heed lest
   at any time there be an evil heart of unbelief in you, lest you be
   hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, lest you fall from grace,
   lest you receive the grace of God in vain, lest you fall from your own
   steadfastness,' in their native and proper tendency import a danger,
   and serve to raise a fear in men lest the danger imported should come
   upon them; whereas such promises as these, made unto the same persons,
   and that not conditionally, as is supposed, that there shall never be a
   heart of unbelief in them, that they shall never be hardened through
   the deceitfulness of sin, that they shall never fall away from the
   grace of God, exclude all danger or possibility of falling away, and
   tend directly to prevent or extinguish all fear in men of any such
   danger: therefore, such exhortations are in their nature and genuine
   import contrary to such promises in theirs, and consequently can be no
   means of bringing them to pass."

   Ans. 1. Exhortations are not so properly the means whereby the promises
   are accomplished as the means whereby the things mentioned in the
   promises are wrought, God by and through them stirring up those graces
   which he promises to work, continue, and to increase in his saints.

   2. "Exhortations divine" must be so apprehended as to be subservient to
   an end, in respect of God foreknown and determined. It is true, we
   exhort men (or may) to those things of whose event we are wholly
   uncertain; but to God this cannot be ascribed. He doth foreknow and
   hath fore-determined the end and issue that every one of his
   exhortations shall have; and therefore such a nature, and no other, is
   to be ascribed to them as is consistent with and subservient to a
   determined end.

   3. To the confirmation of his minor proposition the answer is easy,
   from the consideration, first, of the end of the exhortations insisted
   on unto perseverance, and then of the promises of perseverance
   themselves, which are no way inconsistent therewith. For the first, I
   say, those exhortations, "Take heed lest there be in any of you an evil
   heart of unbelief," and the like, are not given to ingenerate a fear of
   falling away (which is a thing in itself evil and opposite unto that
   steadfastness of faith and full assurance which we should press unto,
   so far is it from any act of faithful obedience that God should aim to
   work in the hearts of his, and apply means thereunto), but only to
   beget a holy care and diligence in them to whom they are made or given
   for the using of the means appointed of God for the avoiding of the
   evil threatened to follow upon a neglect of them; which directly falls
   in and sweetly conspires with the end and use of the promises of
   perseverance by us urged and insisted upon. Nothing is imported by them
   but only the connection that is between the things mentioned in them,
   as unbelief and rejection from God. This God aims at in those
   exhortations, in their particular respect unto believers, that by them
   they may be stirred up to the use of those means which he hath
   appointed for them, to be by them preserved in the grace and mercy
   which he hath infallibly promised to continue to them. And, --

   4. The end of the promises of perseverance on which we have insisted
   being their "mixing with faith," to establish the souls of the saints
   in believing the kindness and faithfulness of God in his covenant in
   Jesus Christ, they do not take away nor prevent all fear of perishing,
   and so, consequently, not that fear in any measure which stirs them up
   so to the use of means that they may not perish, but only are effectual
   for their deliverance out of those dangers which are apt and able of
   themselves to destroy them; as our Saviour himself prays for them, John
   xvii. 15, "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world"
   (where, whilst they are, they will be sure to meet with dangers and
   perplexities enough), "but that thou shouldest keep them from the
   evil," wherewith they must reckon to be exercised. There is not, then,
   the least contrariety or diverse aspect between the assurance of faith
   about the end which the promises tend unto, and the care and godly fear
   about the means instituted and appointed with respect to the end which
   exhortations do beget, and will, notwithstanding those promises.

   5. The greatest inconsistency that can be imagined between exhortations
   and promises, as by us explained, is no more than this, that in one
   place God promiseth that unto us as his grace, which in another he
   requires of us as our duty; between which two whoever feigns an
   opposition, he doth his endeavour to set the covenant of grace, as to
   us proposed and declared, at variance with itself.

   The whole ensuing discourse, unto sect. 12, drawing deep upon another
   controversy, -- namely, "the manner of the operation of grace," -- and
   being for the most part borrowed from what is delivered on that head in
   the Arminian writings, [208] might be passed over as not of any
   necessary consideration in this place. What we assign to the
   exhortations of the word, and their consistency with whatever else we
   teach of the saints' perseverance, being already heard, this argument
   is at its proper issue. But the task undertaken is not to be waived or
   avoided; I shall therefore proceed to the discussion of it. Thus, then,
   he goes on:--

   "If," saith he, "such exhortations as we speak of be a means to effect
   the perseverance which our adversaries suppose to be promised in the
   saints, then must the act of perseverance in the saints necessarily
   depend upon them, so as that it cannot, nor will, be effected without
   them; that is, without the saints submitting themselves to them: but
   persevering upon these terms clearly supposeth a possibility of
   non-persevering; for whatsoever dependeth upon a mutable condition, and
   which possibly may not be performed, may be also possible never to come
   to pass."

   Ans. 1. Exhortations are improperly said to be "a means to effect
   perseverance." We say only that they are means to stir up, quicken, and
   increase, those graces in the exercise whereof the saints, according to
   the purpose and promise of God, do persevere.

   2. The perseverance of the saints doth consist in the abiding and
   continuance of those graces in them which those exhortations do so stir
   up and further or increase; and in that regard there is a connection
   between the perseverance of the saints and the exhortations mentioned,
   yea, a dependence of the one on the other. But this dependence ariseth
   not from the nature of the things themselves, whence such a certainty
   as is asserted would not arise, but from the purpose and appointment of
   God that they should be effectual to that end. And therefore, --

   3. A "perseverance on these terms supposeth a possibility of
   non-persevering," if you regard only the nature of the things
   themselves, and set aside all consideration of the purpose and promises
   of God concerning the end, which is to beg the thing in hand; yea, the
   promise of God extends itself to the certain accomplishment of the
   saints' submission to those exhortations. So that the end aimed at doth
   not depend on a "mutable condition" (if I understand any thing of that
   expression, so unsuited to the business in hand), the performance of
   the condition (or the yielding of such obedience as is required to the
   essence of the saints' perseverance) being certain also from the
   promises of God.

   His 5th section is as followeth: "If it be said that the said
   exhortations are means of the saints' persevering in this respect,
   because God by his Spirit irresistibly and unfrustrably draws and
   persuades the saints to obey these exhortations as means of their
   persevering, I answer, It cannot be proved that God doth draw or
   persuade his saints upon any such terms to obey these exhortations,
   nay, frequent experience showeth, and our adversaries' doctrine,
   frequently mentioned, expressly granteth, that the saints many times
   are so far from obeying these exhortations, that they walk for a long
   time in full opposition to them, as in security, looseness, vile
   practices. Nor have they yet proved, nor, I believe, ever will prove,
   but that they may walk, yea, and that many have thus walked, I mean in
   full opposition to the said exhortations, to their dying day. Secondly,
   If God by his Spirit irresistibly draws his saints to obey the
   exhortations we speak of, he thus draweth them either by such a force
   or power immediately acted upon their wills, by which they are made
   willing to obey them, or else he maketh use of the said exhortations so
   to work or affect their wills that they become willing accordingly. If
   the former be asserted, then, 1. The said exhortations are no means
   whereby the perseverance of the saints is effected, but God
   irresistibly by his Spirit: for if the will be thus immediately
   affected by God after such a manner, and wrought to such a bent and
   inclination, as that it cannot but obey the said exhortations, or do
   the things which the said exhortations require, then would it have done
   the same thing whether there had been any such exhortations in being or
   no, and consequently these exhortations could have no manner of
   efficiency about their perseverance; for the will, according to the
   common saying, is of itself' a blind faculty,' and follows its own
   predominant bent and inclination, without taking knowledge whether the
   ways and actions towards which it stands bent be commanded or exhorted
   unto by God or no. 2. If the will of a saint be immediately so affected
   by God that it stands inclined and bent to do the things which are
   proper to cause him to persevere, then is this bent and inclination
   wrought in the will of such a person after his being a saint, and
   consequently is not essential to him as a saint, but merely accidental
   and adventitious; and if so, then is there no inclination or bent in
   the will of a saint as such, or from his first being a mint, to
   persevere, or to do the things which accompany perseverance, but they
   come to be wrought in him afterward: which how consistent it is with
   the principles either of reason or religion, or their own, I am content
   that my adversaries themselves should judge. 3. If God doth immediately
   and irresistibly incline or move the wills of the saints to do the
   things which accompany perseverance, the said exhortations can be no
   means of effecting this perseverance; for the will, being physically
   and irresistibly acted and drawn by God to do such and such things,
   needeth no addition of moral means, such as exhortations are (if they
   be any), in order hereunto. What a man is necessitated to, he needeth
   no farther help or means to do it. 4. The things which accompany
   perseverance import a continuance in faith and love to the end. If,
   then, the wills of the saints be immediately and irresistibly moved by
   God thus to continue, -- I mean in faith and love to the end, -- what
   place is there for exhortations to come in with their efficiency
   towards that perseverance? Need they be exhorted to continue in faith
   and love, or to persevere after the end? Thus, then, we clearly see
   that the former of the two consequents mentioned cannot stand. God doth
   not by his Spirit irresistibly draw or move the wills of the saints to
   do the things which are necessary for the procuring their perseverance
   immediately, or without the instrumental interposure of the said
   exhortations."

   Ans. First, the intendment of this, as also of some following sections,
   is to prove and manifest that the use of exhortations cannot consist
   with the efficacy of internal grace, and the work of the Spirit in
   producing and effecting those graces in us which in those exhortations
   we are provoked and stirred up unto; -- a very sad undertaking truly,
   to my apprehension, and for which the church of God will scarce ever
   return thanks to them that shall engage in it! He was of another mind
   who cried, "Da, Domine, quod jubes, et jube quod vis." Yea, and the
   Holy Ghost hath, in innumerable places of Scripture, expressed himself
   of another mind, promising to work effectually in us what he requires
   earnestly of us; by the one manifesting the efficacy of his grace, by
   the other the exigency of the duty which is incumbent upon us. Nay,
   never any saint of God once prayed in his life, seeking any thing at
   the hand of God, but was of another mind, if he understood his own
   supplications. To what is here urged against this catholic faith of
   believers, I say, --

   That exhortations are the means of perseverance, inasmuch as by them,
   in their place and kind, and with them, the Spirit of God effectually
   works this perseverance, or the matter of it, in the saints. Those
   cloudy expressions of "Irresistibly and unfrustrably" we own no farther
   than as they denote the certainty of the event, and not the manner of
   the Spirit's operation; which also they do very unhandsomely. We leave
   out, then, in the proposal of our judgment about the use of
   exhortations, which Mr Goodwin opposeth, those terms, and add in their
   room, "By and with those exhortations," which he omits.

   He saith, then, "This cannot be proved, because the saints live and die
   oftentimes in opposition and disobedience unto these exhortations."

   But obedience is twofold: First, As to the general frame of the heart,
   -- obedience in the habit; and so it is false that the saints live at
   any time in an ordinary course, much less die in opposition to those
   exhortations. The law of God being written in their hearts, and they
   delighting in it in their inward man, they abide therein, the fruit of
   obedience for the most part being brought forth by them: and this
   sufficeth as to their perseverance. Secondly, It regardeth particular
   acts of obedience; and in respect of them we all say that yet they all
   sin ("Optimus ille est, qui mlnimis urgetur"): but this prejudiceth not
   their perseverance, nor the general end of the exhortations afforded
   them for that purpose.

   But he adds, secondly, "If God by his Spirit irresistibly draws his
   saints to persevere," ut supra.

   But this is sorry sophistry, "which may be felt," as they say, "through
   a pair of mittens;" for, --

   1. Who says that God works by force immediately upon the wills of men?
   Or who makes force and power to be terms equivalent? or says that God
   cannot put forth the "exceeding greatness of his power in them that
   believe," but he must force or compel their wills? or, that he cannot
   "work in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure," immediately
   working in and with our wills, but he must so force them?

   2. Whence ariseth the disjunctive force of this argument, "Either by
   immediate actings upon their wills, or he maketh use of those
   exhortations?" as though the one way were exclusive of the other, and
   that the Scripture did not abundantly and plentifully ascribe both
   these unto God; both that he exhorts us to know him, love him, believe
   in him, and gives us an understanding and a heart so to do, working
   faith and love in us by the exceeding efficacy of his power and Spirit.
   I say, then, that God works immediately by his Spirit in and on the
   wills of his saints; that is, he puts forth a real physical power that
   is not contained in those exhortations, though he doth it by, and in,
   and with them. The impotency that is in us to do good is not amiss
   termed ethico-physica, both natural and moral; and the applications of
   God to the soul in their doing good are both really and physically
   efficient and moral also, the one consisting in the efficacy of his
   Spirit, the other lying in the exhortations of the word, yet so as that
   the efficacy of the Spirit is exerted by and with the moral efficacy of
   the word, his work being but grace or the law in the heart, the word
   being the law written. So that all the ensuing reasonings are bottomed
   upon things male divisa that stand in a sweet harmony and compliance
   with each other.

   But Mr Goodwin tells you, "That if God work by his Spirit and his grace
   immediately on the wills of men, to cause them to persevere, then are
   exhortations no means of their perseverance."

   Why so, I pray? It seems we must have no internal effectual grace from
   God, or no outward exhortations of the word; but he tells you it must
   be so, "Because if the will be physically and irresistibly acted and
   drawn by God to do such and such things, it needeth no addition of
   moral means; such are exhortations thereunto." That is, if the will be
   effectually inclined to the ways of God by his grace, there is then no
   need of the exhortations of the word. But yet, --

   1. The Spirit of God, though he has an immediate efficacy of his own by
   and with those exhortations, yet by those exhortations he also inclines
   the will; and as he works on the will as corrupt and impotent by his
   grace, so he works on the will (as the will, or as such a faculty, is
   apt to be wrought upon by a mediation of the understanding) by
   exhortations.

   2. To say, "Obedience would have been produced and wrought had there
   been no exhortations," is not required of us, what efficacy soever we
   ascribe to grace, unless we also deny exhortations to be appointed of
   God and to be used by the Spirit of God for the producing of that
   obedience. Neither, --

   3. Doth God work upon the will as a distinct faculty alone of itself,
   without suiting his operations to the other faculties of the soul; nor
   is grace to be wrought or carried on in us merely as we have wills, but
   as we have understandings also, whereby the exhortations he is pleased
   to use may be conveyed to the will and affect it in their kind. In a
   word, this is but repeating what was said before, "If there be any
   effectual grace, there is no use of exhortations; or if exhortations be
   the means of continuing or increasing grace, what need the efficacy of
   grace or immediate actings of the Spirit, working in us to will and to
   do of God's good pleasure?" What validity there is in these inferences
   will be easily discerned. God worketh grace in men as men, and as men
   impotent and corrupt by sin. As men he works upon them by means suited
   to their rational being, -- by precepts and exhortations; but as men
   impotent and corrupt by sin, they stand in need of his effectual power
   to work that in them which he requireth of them. Of the terms wherewith
   his arguing in this case is clouded and darkened, enough hath been
   remarked already.

   His second argument to this purpose, namely, "That the inclination of
   the will to good and to persevere in a saint must be after his being
   made a saint," is as weak and no less sophistical than the former. That
   inclination is radically wrought in every believer at his conversion,
   the Spirit being bestowed on him, which shall abide with him for ever,
   and the seed of God laid in his heart, that shall remain and never
   utterly fail, with an habitual inclination to the exercise of all those
   graces wherein their persevering doth consist. Actually this is wrought
   in them according to the particular duties and actings of grace that
   are required of them; which they are carried forth unto by the daily
   influence of life, power, and grace, which they receive from Christ
   their head, without whom they can do nothing.

   Neither is the third exception of any more validity, being only a
   repetition of what was spoken before, rendered something more impedite,
   dark, and intricate, by the terms of "physically," "irresistibly," and
   "necessitated;" which how far and wherein we do allow hath been
   frequently declared. The sum of what is spoken amounts to this, "God's
   real work in and upon the soul by his Spirit and grace is inconsistent
   with exhortations to obedience;" which we have before disproved, and do
   reject it as an assertion destructive to all the efficacy of the grace
   of God and the whole work of it upon the souls of men.

   What his fourth argument also is but a repetition of the same things
   before crudely asserted in other terms, let them apprehend that can:
   "If God work faith and love in the hearts of his saints, and support
   them in them to the end, what place is left for exhortations?" I say,
   Their own proper place, the place of means, of means appointed by God
   to stir up his to perseverance, and which himself makes, by his Spirit
   and the immediate efficacy thereof, effectual to that end and purpose.
   And I know no use of that query, "Are exhortations effectual to
   persuade men to persevere after the end?" it being built only on his
   false hypothesis and begging of the thing in question, namely, "That if
   God work faith and love, and continuance of them, in our hearts
   effectually by his grace, there is no need, no use of exhortations,"
   though God so work them by and with those exhortations.

   And this is his first attempt upon the first member of the division
   made by himself, wherein what success he hath obtained is left to the
   judgment of the reader; and but that I shall not, -- having now the
   part of one that answers incumbent on me, -- turn aside unto the proof
   of things denied, I should easily confirm what hath been given in for
   the removal of his objections from the testimony of God, by innumerable
   places of Scripture.

   He proceeds, then, sect. 6, and says, "Secondly, Neither can the latter
   of the said consequences stand. God doth not make use of the said
   exhortations to influence or affect the wills of the saints upon any
   such terms as thereby to make them infallibly, unfrustrably,
   necessitatingly, willing to persevere, or to do the things upon which
   perseverance dependeth.

   "For, first, If so, then one and the same act of the will should be
   both physical and moral, and so be specifically distinguished in and
   from itself. For so far as it is produced by the irresistible force or
   power of the Spirit of God, it must needs be physical, the said
   irresistible working of the Spirit being a physical action, and so not
   proper to produce a moral effect. Again, as far as the said
   exhortations are means to produce or raise this act of the will, or
   contribute any thing towards it, it must needs be moral, because
   exhortations are moral causes, and so not capable of producing
   physical, natural, or necessary effects. Now, then, if it be impossible
   that one and the same act of the will should be both physical and
   moral, -- that is, necessary and not necessary, -- impossible also it
   is that it should be produced by the irresistible working of God and by
   exhortations of this joint efficiency.

   "It may be objected, They who hold or grant such an influence or
   operation of the Spirit of God upon the will which is frustrable or
   resistible, do and must suppose it to be a physical action as well as
   that which is irresistible. If so, then the act of the will, so far as
   it is raised by the means of this action or operation of God, must,
   according to the tenor of the former argument, be physical also, and so
   the pretended impossibility is no more avoided by this opinion than by
   the other.'

   "I answer, Though such an operation of God upon the will as is here
   mentioned be, in respect of God and of the manner of its proceeding
   from him, physical, yet, in respect of the nature and substance of it,
   it is properly moral; because it impresseth and affecteth the will upon
   which it is acted after the manner of moral causes, properly so called,
   -- that is, persuadingly, not ravishingly or necessitatingly. When a
   minister of the gospel in his preaching presseth or persuadeth men to
   such and such duties or actions, this act, as it proceedeth from him,
   -- I mean, as it is raised by his natural abilities of understanding
   and speaking, -- is physical or natural, but in respect of the
   substance or native tendency of it it is clearly moral, namely, because
   it tendeth to incline or move the wills of men to such or such
   elections without necessitating them thereunto; and so comports with
   those arguments or exhortations, in their manner of efficiency, by
   which he presseth or moveth them to such things. By the way, to prevent
   stumbling and quarrelling, it no way follows from the premises that a
   minister in his preaching or persuading unto duties should do as much
   as God himself doth in or towards the persuading of men hereunto. It
   only follows that the minister doth co-operate with God (which the
   apostle himself affirms) in order to one and the same effect; -- that
   is, that he operateth in one and the same kind of efficiency with God,
   morally or persuadingly, not necessitating; for where one necessitates
   and another only persuades, they cannot be said to cooperate or work
   the one with the other, no more than two, when the one runs and the
   other walks a soft pace, can be said to go or walk together. But when
   two persuade in one and the same action, one may persuade more
   effectually by many degrees than the other, may have a peculiar tact or
   method of persuading above the other."

   That which is now undertaken to be proved is, that God doth make use of
   exhortations as means for the establishing of the saints in believing
   and for confirming their perseverance. This is that which by us is
   assigned unto them, and this is all that the nature of them doth
   require that they should be used unto, the certainty of the event
   whereunto they are applied depending not on their nature, as such
   means, but on the purpose of God to use them for that end which he hath
   designed and promised to bring about and accomplish.

   Before he ventures on any opposition to the intendment of this
   assertion, he phraseth it so as either to render it unintelligible to
   himself and others, or (if any thing be signified by the expressions he
   useth) to divert it wholly from the mind of them and their sense with
   whom he hath to do. Who ever said that "God by exhortations doth
   influence the wills of men upon such terms as to make them unfrustrably
   and necessitatingly willing to persevere?" Or, can he tell us what is
   the meaning of these terms, "Unfrustrably, necessitatingly willing to
   persevere?" Though it is easy to guess at what he here intends, yet it
   is far above my shallow capacity to reach the sense of these
   expressions. How any of these terms, relating to the event and issue of
   things, [are used,] and in what sense they may be used, I have often
   showed. As relating either to the manner of God's operation in and upon
   the will, or the will's elicitation of its own act (any farther than by
   relation to that axiom, "Unumquodque quod est, dum est, necesse est"),
   they express neither our sense nor any body's else that I know. That
   which I shall make bold to take up for Mr Goodwin's intendment is, that
   God doth not by exhortations effectually cause the saints to persevere.
   To be willing to persevere is to persevere; to be "necessitatingly
   willing" is I know not what. Now, if such an efficacy be ascribed to
   exhortations as teaches the certainty of the effect, so that the
   certainty of the effect as to the event should be asserted to depend on
   them as such means, this is nothing to us. We ascribe an efficacy to
   them in proprio genere, but the certainty of that event to whose
   production they concur, we affirm, as hath been abundantly declared, to
   depend on other causes.

   But the proof of what is here asserted outruns for uncouth strangeness
   the assertion itself, equis albis, as they say; for, saith he, "If this
   be so" (that is, "as you have heard above" -- how, neither he nor we
   know), "then the same act of the will should be both physical and
   moral." And, --

   1. Why so? "Because physical and moral means are used for the producing
   of it!" -- as though sundry causes of several kinds might not concur to
   produce one uniform effect, far enough from a necessity of receiving so
   much as a denomination from each of them. In the concurrence of several
   causes, whereof some may be free and contingent, others natural and
   necessary, the effect absolutely follows its next and immediate cause
   alone. God causes the sun to shine freely, yet is the shining of the
   sun a necessary effect of the sun, and not any way free or contingent.
   God determined the piercing of Christ's side, and so as to the event
   made it necessary, but yet was the doing of it in them that did it free
   as to the manner of its doing, and no way necessary. But, --

   2. Suppose the same act of the will should be said to be both physical
   and moral upon several accounts? And what if every act of the will in
   and about things good or bad be so, and it be utterly impossible it
   should be otherwise? "Yea, but then the same act should be specifically
   distinguished in and from itself."

   Yea, but who told you so? The terms of "physical and moral," as related
   to the acts of the will, are very far from constituting different kinds
   or species of acts, being only several denominations of the same
   individual acts upon several regards and accounts. The acts of the will
   as they flow from that natural faculty, or are elicited thereby, are
   all physical, but as they relate to a law whence they are good or evil,
   they are moral; the one term expresseth their being, the other their
   regularity and conformity to some rule whereunto their agents are
   obliged. "Quid dignum tanto?" If by "physical and moral" Mr Goodwin
   intends "necessary and free," (being the first that ever abused these
   words, and in that abuse of them not consistent with himself, alarming
   afterward the act of a minister's preaching, as proceeding from his
   abilities of understanding and speaking, to be physical or natural,
   which yet he will not aver to be necessary, but free), he should have
   told us so; and then, though we would not grant that the same act may
   not in several respects be both necessary and free, the latter in
   respect of the manner of its performance and nature of its immediate
   cause, the former in respect of the event and the determination of its
   first cause, yet its consequent is so palpably false, as to the
   advancing of his former assertion, that it would have been directly
   denied, without any farther trouble.

   But he adds, "It must needs be physical, because it is produced by the
   physical working of the Spirit of God, which, being a physical action,
   cannot produce a moral effect."

   Ans. By physical operation of God on and with the will, we understand
   only that which is really and effectually so, as different from that
   which is only moral and by way of motive and persuasion. Now, this we
   say is twofold; the first consisting in the concourse of God, as the
   first cause and author of all beings, to the producing of every entity,
   such as the acts of the wills of men are, and this in such a way as is
   not only consistent with the liberty of the will in all its acts and
   actings whatever, but also as is the foundation of all the liberty that
   the will hath in its actings. And in respect of this influence of God,
   the effect produced is only physical or natural, having such a being as
   is proper to it; as also it is in respect of the will itself, and its
   concurrence in operation. The other is that which Mr Goodwin here calls
   "The irresistible force or power of the Spirit," distinguishing the
   efficacy of the Spirit and grace of God in their working in us to will
   and to do, producing those effects as they are good and gracious, in
   reference to their rise, end, and rule, whereunto they are related.
   This, then, is that which by Mr Goodwin is here asserted, "That if
   there be such an effectual real working of the Spirit and grace of God
   in us to the producing of any acts of the wills of men, they cannot be
   moral;" that is, they cannot have any goodness in them beyond that
   which is entitative. And so far are we now arrived: All efficacious
   working of the Spirit of God on us must be excluded, or all we do is
   good for nothing. Away with all promises, all prayers, yea, the whole
   covenant of grace; they serve for no other end but to keep us from
   doing good. Let us hear the Scripture speak a little in this cause:
   Deut. xxx. 6, "The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
   heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
   with all thy soul, that thou mayest live." Jer. xxxi. 33, "This shall
   be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those
   days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and
   write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my
   people." Chap. xxxii. 39, "I will give them one heart, and one way,
   that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their
   children after them." Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, "A new heart also will I
   give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away
   the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of
   flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
   statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." Acts xvi. 14,
   "The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that she attended unto the things
   which were spoken of Paul." Phil. i. 29, "Unto you it is given in the
   behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for
   his sake;" and chap. ii. 13, "It is God which worketh in you both to
   will and to do of his good pleasure." As also Eph. i. 18-20, "That ye
   may know what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who
   believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought
   in Christ, when he raised him front the dead." And, 2 Thess. i. 11, "We
   pray always for you, that our God would fulfil all the good pleasure of
   his goodness, and the work of faith with power." So also in 2 Cor. v.
   17, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature;" for, Eph. ii. 4,
   5, "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved
   us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
   Christ," causing us, chap. iv. 24, to "put on the new man, which after
   God is created in righteousness and true holiness;" with the like
   assertions, John iii. 3; James i. 18; 1 Pet. i. 23; John v. 21; 2 Cor.
   iii. 5, etc.

   What may be thought of these and the like expressions? Do they hold out
   any real, effectual, internal work of the Spirit and grace of God
   distinct from moral persuasion, or do they not? If they do, how comes
   any thing so wrought in us and by us to be morally good? If they do
   not, we may bid farewell unto all renewing, regenerating, assisting,
   effectual grace of God. That God, then, by his Spirit and grace, cannot
   enable us to act morally and according to a rule, is not yet proved.
   What follows?

   Saith he, "So far as exhortations are means to produce these acts, they
   must be moral; for moral causes are not capable of producing natural or
   physical effects."

   But if Mr Goodwin think that, in this controversy, "physical" and
   "necessary," as applied to effects, are isodunamounta, he is heavenly
   wide. "Physical" denotes only their being "necessary," a manner of
   being as to some of them which have physically a being. The term
   "natural" is ambiguous, and sometimes used in the one sense, sometimes
   in the other; sometimes it denotes that which is only, sometimes that
   which is in such a kind. By a physical effect, we understand an effect
   with respect to its real existency; as by a moral effect, an effect in
   respect of its regularity. And now, why may not a moral cause have an
   influence, in its own kind, to the production of a physical effect; I
   mean, an influence suited to its own nature and manner of operation, by
   the way of motive and persuasion? What would you think of him that
   should persuade you to lift your hand above your head to try how high
   you could reach, or whether your arm were not out of joint?

   Secondly, It hath been sufficiently showed before, that with these
   exhortations, which work as appointed means, morally God exerteth an
   effectual power for the real production of that whereunto the
   exhortation tends; dealing thus with our whole souls suitably to the
   nature of all their faculties, as every one of them is fitted and
   suited to be wrought upon for the accomplishment of the end he aims at,
   and in the manner that he intends. Briefly, to every act of the will as
   an act, in genere entis, there is required a really operative and
   physical concurrence of the providential power of God, in its own order
   as the first cause; to every act as good or gracious, the operative
   concurrence and influence of the Spirit of grace; -- which yet hinders
   not but that by exhortations men may be provoked and stirred up to the
   performance of acts as such, and to the performance of them as good and
   gracious.

   This being not the direct controversy in hand, I do but touch upon it.
   Concerning that which follows, I should perhaps say we have found
   anguem in herba; but being so toothless and stingless as it is to any
   that in the least attend to it, it may be only termed the pad in the
   straw. [209] "Physical and moral" are taken to be terms, it seems,
   equipollent to "necessary and not necessary;" which is such a wresting
   of the terms themselves and their known use as men shall not likely
   meet withal. Hence is it that acts physical and necessary are the same.
   Every act of the most free agent under heaven, yea, in heaven or earth,
   is in its own nature and being physical. Acts also are moral, that is,
   good or evil, consequently in order of nature to their existence (of
   which "necessary" or "not necessary" are the adjunct manner), in
   reference to the rule or law whereunto their conformity is required.
   How "moral" and "not necessary" come to be terms of the same import Mr
   Goodwin will declare perhaps hereafter, when he shall have leisure to
   teach as much new philosophy as he hath already done divinity. In the
   meantime, we deny that any influence from God on the wills of men doth
   make any act of them necessary as to the manner of its production. And
   so this first argument for the inconsistency of the use of
   exhortations, with the real efficiency of the grace and Spirit of God
   is concluded.

   That which follows in this section to the end is a pretended answer to
   an objection of our author's own framing, being only introduced to give
   farther advantage to express himself against any real efficiency of the
   Spirit or grace of God in the hearts or on the wills of men. Not to
   insist upon his darkening the discourse in hand, from his miserable
   confounding of those terms "physical" and "moral," formerly discovered,
   I shall, as near as I can, close with his aim in it, for the more clear
   consideration thereof:--

   First, he tells us, "That the operation of God on the will of man is,
   in respect of its proceeding from him, physical; but in respect of its
   nature and substance, it is properly moral."

   1. But first, If a man should ask Mr Goodwin what he intends by this
   "operation of God on the will of man," to the end intended, I fear he
   would be very hard put to it to instance in any particular. It is
   sufficiently evident, he acknowledgeth none in this kind but what
   consists in the exhortations of the word.

   2. Having told us before that "physical" is as much as "necessary," and
   "moral" as "not necessary," how comes it about that the same operation
   of God, the same act of his power, is become in several regards
   physical and moral, -- that is, necessary and not necessary? Is Mr
   Goodwin reconciled to the assertion that the same thing may be said to
   be necessary and not necessary in sundry respects?

   3. How comes the same act or operation in respect of its manner of
   proceeding from its agent to be physical, and in respect of its
   substance to be moral? or, is any act moral in respect of its
   substance, or is its morality an adjunct of it, in respect of the
   regard it hath to some rule and farther end? It is an easy thing for
   any to heap up such crude assertions, and in the meantime not to know
   what they say nor whereof they do affirm. But the reason why the acts
   of God intimated are moral is, "because they persuade the will only, or
   work persuadingly, not ravishingly or necessitatingly." That is, in
   plain terms, there is no operation of the grace or Spirit of God in the
   working of any good in the hearts or wills of men, but only what
   consisteth in persuasion of them thereunto. For any real efficiency as
   to the communication of strength in "working in us to will and to do,"
   it is wholly excluded. God only persuades, men have the power in
   themselves, and of themselves they do it, let the Scripture say what it
   will to the contrary. For those terms of "ravishingly or
   necessitatingly," which are opposed to this moral persuasion, whereunto
   the operations of God for the production of any good in us are tied up
   and confined, we have been now so inured to them that they do not at
   all startle us. When Mr Goodwin shall manifest that God cannot, by the
   greatness of his power, work in us to will without ravishing our wills,
   if we guess aright at the intendment of that expression, he will
   advance to a considerable success in this contest, not only against us,
   but God himself.

   But an objection presents itself to our author, which he sees a
   necessity to attempt the removal of, lest an apprehension of its truth
   should prove prejudicial to the receiving of his dictates; and this is,
   "That if it be so, that God worketh on the will of man by the way of
   persuasion only, he doth no more than the ministers of the gospel do,
   who persuade men by the word to that which is good." To this he tells
   you, "That it indeed follows that God and ministers work on the will of
   man in the same way, with the same kind of efficiency; but yet in
   respect of degrees, God may persuade more effectually than a minister."

   1. That all really efficient, internal, working grace of God was denied
   by Mr Goodwin, was before discovered; here only it is more plainly
   asserted: "All the workings of God on the wills of men unto good are
   merely by persuasion." Persuasion, we know, gives no strength, adds no
   power, to him that is persuaded to any thing. It only provokes him and
   irritates him to put forth, exert, and exercise, the power which is in
   himself unto the things whereunto he is persuaded, upon the motives and
   grounds of persuasion proposed to him; and the whole effect produced,
   on that account, is in solidum to be ascribed to the really efficient
   cause of it, howsoever incited or stirred up. Whereas, then, men by
   nature are dead, blind, unbelieving, enemies to God, he only persuades
   them to exert the power that is in them, and thereby to live, see,
   believe, and be reconciled to him. And this is to exalt the free grace
   of God by Jesus Christ! We know full well who have gone before you in
   these paths, but shall heartily pray that none of the saints of God may
   follow after you into this contempt of the work of his grace. But, --

   2. If nothing but persuasion be allowed to God in the work of men's
   conversion, and in the carrying on of their obedience to the end,
   wherein doth the persuasion of God consist, in distinction from the
   persuasion used in and from the word by ministers, which it is
   pretended that it may excel (though it is not affirmed that it doth) by
   many degrees? Let it be considered, I say, in what acts of the will, or
   power of God, his persuasion, so distinct as above mentioned, doth
   consist; let us know what arguments he useth, by what means he applies
   them, how he conveys them to the wills of men, that are not coincident
   with those of the ministry. I suppose at last it will be found that
   there is no other operation of God in persuading men, as to the ends
   under consideration, but only what lies or consists in the persuading
   of the word by the ministers thereof, God looking on without the
   exerting of any efficacy whatever; which is indeed that which is aimed
   at, and is really exclusive of the grace of God from any hand in the
   conversion of sinners or preservation of believers.

   3. He doth not, indeed, assert any such persuading of God, but only
   tells you that from what he hath spoken "it doth not fellow that God
   doth no more than ministers in persuading men, and that when two
   persuade to one and the same action, one may be more effectual in his
   persuading than another;" but that God is so, or how he is so, or
   wherein his peculiar persuasions do consist, there is not in his
   discourse the least intimation.

   4. There is in men a different power as to persuasion, some having a
   faculty that way far more eminent and effectual than others, according
   to their skill and proficiency in oratory and persuasive arts, This
   only is ascribed to God, that he so excels us as one man excels
   another; but how that excellency of his is exerted, that is not to be
   understood. But there is proof tendered you of all this from 1 Cor.
   iii. 9, where ministers are said to "co-operate with God, which they
   cannot do unless it be with the same kind of efficiency," (well said!)
   "and that when one works necessitatingly and another by persuasion,
   they cannot be said to co- operate, no more than one that runs and
   another that walks can be said to walk together." Certainly our author
   never dreamed that any man whatever would put himself to the trouble of
   examining these dictates, or he would have been more wary of his
   asserting them, and we had not had so much, not only new and strange
   divinity, but new and uncouth philosophy, heaped up without any
   considerable endeavour of proof or confirmation.

   (1.) That two agents cannot concur or co-operate to the producing of
   the same effect but with the same kind of efficiency is a rare notion
   indeed. Was he never persuaded to do any thing in his life? What thinks
   he of David and the Ammonites' killing of Uriah? of a judge and an
   executioner slaying a malefactor? of God and Satan moving David to
   number the people? of God and Joseph's brethren sending him to Egypt?
   But what need I mention instances? Who knows not that this so confounds
   all muses efficient, and that principal and instrumental, material,
   final, formal, which in their production of effects have all their
   distinct efficiency, and yet their co-operation?

   (2.) The proof from the Scripture mentioned extends only to the
   interesting of ministers in the great honour of co-operating with God
   in the work of begetting and increasing faith in their own sphere,
   according to the work to them committed; but that God and they do work
   with the same kind of efficiency, it is the main intendment of the
   apostle in the place cited (1 Cor. iii.) to disprove. He tells you,
   indeed, there is a work of planting and watering committed to the
   ministers of the gospel; but the giving of increase (a peculiar working
   with a distinct kind of efficiency), that is alone to be ascribed to
   God. It is, I say, his design (who everywhere abundantly informs us
   that "faith is the gift of God, wrought in us by the exceeding
   greatness of his power") to prove in this place that though the
   dispensation of the word of the gospel be committed unto men, yet their
   whole ministry will be vain and of none effect, unless, by an immediate
   efficacy or working of his Spirit, giving and bestowing faith on his
   elect, God do give an increase.

   (3.) For the term of "necessitating," put upon the real effectual work
   of God's grace on the wills of men, giving them power and assistance,
   and working in them to will and to do, as different from that which is
   purely moral or persuasive only, which communicates no strength or
   power, I shall need no more but to reject it with the same facility
   wherewith it is imposed on us. The similitude of one walking and
   another running, wherewith [he sets forth] the inconsistency of a real
   efficient work of grace with persuasion, so far as that they should be
   said to co-operate to the producing of the same effect, doth not in the
   least illustrate what it is intended to set off; for though one run and
   another go softly (as suppose one carrying a little loaf, another a
   great burden of meat, for a supper), and both going to the same place,
   why may not they be said to co-operate to the providing of the same
   supper? Must all agents that co-operate to the producing of the same
   effect be together in one place? You may as soon bring heaven and hell
   together as prove it. And why must real efficiency be compared to
   "running," and persuasion to "soft walking?" as though one were
   supposed to carry on the work faster than the other, when we only say,
   that in the one there is a distinct power exerted from what is in the
   other; which that it may be done might be proved by a thousand
   instances, and illustrated by as many similitudes, if any pleasure were
   taken to abound in causâ facili. God and man then co-operate in respect
   of the tendency of their working unto the event, not in respect of the
   kinds of their efficiency.

   Of the 7th section (whereon we shall not need long to insist), which in
   the entrance frames an objection and pretends an answer to it, there
   are three parts. In the first he says that we affirm "That though the
   will be necessitated by God, yet it is free in its election; which, how
   it may be, he understands not." But if this were all the inconvenience,
   that Mr Goodwin could not understand how to salve the operation of God
   in man with the liberty of his will, seeing as wise men as himself have
   herein been content to captivate their understandings to the obedience
   of faith, it were not much to be stumbled at; but the truth is, the
   chimera whose nature he professeth himself unacquainted withal is
   created in his own imagination, where it is easy for every man to frame
   such notions as neither himself nor any else can bring to a consistency
   with reason or truth. Of necessitating the will to election we have had
   occasion more than once already to treat, and shall not burden the
   reader with needless repetitions.

   In the second division of the section, he gives you his judgment of the
   manner of the work of God upon the soul unto the doing of that which is
   good, and the effect produced thereby: whereof the one, as was said
   before, consists in persuasions, which he says "are thus far
   irresistible, that they who are to be persuaded cannot hinder but that
   God may persuade them or exhort them, though he prevail not with them;"
   -- which, doubtless, is a notable exaltation of his grace. Thus Mr
   Goodwin works irresistibly with one or other, perhaps, every day. And
   "the effect of this persuasion is" (that is, when it is effectual)
   "that impression which it leaves upon the soul to the things whereunto
   it is persuaded;" as the case is in the dealing of men one with
   another. For my part, I see no reason why our author should so often so
   heedfully deliver his judgment concerning this thing, especially
   without the least attempt of any scriptural proof or endeavour to
   answer those innumerable clear and express places of Scripture which he
   knows are everywhere and on all occasions produced and insisted on to
   prove a real efficient acting of God in and with the wills of men, for
   the producing, working, and accomplishing, that which is good, in a way
   distinct from that of persuasion, which contributes no real strength to
   the person persuaded, concurring only metaphorically in the producing
   of the effect. Let this at last, then, suffice. We are abundantly
   convinced of his denial of the work of God's grace in the salvation of
   souls.

   In the third place we have a rhetorical flourish over that which he
   hath been laying out his strength against all this while, being a mere
   repetition of what hath been already tendered and given in to
   consideration over and over. "If God cause the saints effectually to
   persevere" (his terms of "irresistibly" and "necessitating" have been
   long since discharged from any farther attendance or service in this
   warfare) "by exhortations, then are all his premises of perseverance in
   vain." But why so? May not God enjoin the use of means, and promise by
   them the attainment of the end? May he not promise that to us which he
   will work himself effectually in us? If God effectually work in us to
   give us, by what means soever, a new heart, may he not promise to give
   us a new heart? "Yea, but amongst men this would be incongruous, yea,
   ridiculous, that a father should promise his son an inheritance, and
   then persuade him to take heed that he may obtain it."

   But, first If this be "incongruous, yea, ridiculous," amongst men, in
   their dealings with one another, doth it therefore follow that it must
   be so as to God's dealings with men? "Are his thoughts as our thoughts,
   and his ways as our ways?" Is not the wisdom of God foolishness with
   men, and theirs much more so with him? Are men bound in their dealings
   with others to consider them not only in their natural and civil
   relations, but as impotent and corrupted men, as God in his dealings
   with them doth?

   Secondly, Neither is this course so ridiculous amongst men as Mr
   Goodwin imagineth. That a father, having promised his son an
   inheritance, and instated it on him, or assured it to him, should
   exhort and persuade him to behave himself worthy of his kindness, and
   to take heed that he come to the enjoyment of the inheritance which he
   hath provided for him by the means that he hath appointed (for the
   prescription of means for the enjoyment of the inheritance must be
   supposed to go along with the promise and assurance), is far from being
   a course so ridiculous as is pretended.

   Neither, thirdly, is this similitude analogous with that which it is
   produced to illustrate; for, -- 1. A man may know how, and when, and on
   what account, an inheritance is settled on him by his father; but of
   what God promiseth we have faith only, not knowledge, properly so
   called; nor always the assurance of faith as to the enjoyment of the
   thing promised, but the adherence of faith, as to the truth and
   faithfulness of the promiser. Nor, -- 2. Can a father work in his son
   that obedience which he requireth of him, as He can do who creates a
   new heart in us, and writes his law and fear therein. 3. This absolute
   engagement to bestow an inheritance, whether the means of obtaining it
   be used and insisted on or no, is a thing most remote from what we
   ascribe to the Lord in his promises of perseverance, which are only
   that believers shall persevere by the use of means; which means he
   exhorts them to use, and yet, dealing with them in a covenant of grace
   and mercy, entered into upon account of their utter insufficiency in
   themselves to do the things that are well pleasing to him, whereunto
   they are so exhorted, he himself effectually and graciously, according
   to the tenor of that covenant, works in them what he requires of them,
   bearing them forth in the power of his grace to the use of the means
   appointed.

   His sections 8 and 9 contain an endeavour for the taking off an
   instance usually given of pressing to the use of means, when the end is
   infallibly promised to be accomplished and brought about in and by the
   use of those means; and this is in the passage of Paul, Acts xxvii.
   21-36, whereof something formerly hath been spoken. Paul receives a
   promise from God, that none of the lives of the persons with him in the
   ship should perish. This he declares to his company; and how deeply he
   was concerned in the accomplishment of the promise, and his prediction
   thereupon, upon the account of the undertaking wherein, against almost
   all the world, he was then engaged, and the cause for which he was
   committed to their company and custody, was formerly declared.
   Notwithstanding this, he afterward exhorts them, and directs to the use
   of all means imaginable that were suitable for the fulfilling of the
   promise he had, and the prediction he had made. Evident it is, then,
   that there is no inconsistency, nor any thing unbecoming any perfection
   in God, in that compliance of promises and exhortations which we insist
   upon, he having directed Paul to walk in that very way and path. God,
   we say, in the covenant of grace hath promised that his saints shall
   never leave him nor forsake him, and that he will abide in unchangeable
   constancy to be their God, -- that he will preserve them and keep them
   in his hand unto the kingdom of his Son in glory, saving his redeemed
   ones with an everlasting salvation, to the accomplishment of the end
   promised; which he will, upon the account of his truth and
   faithfulness, bring about by means suitable unto and instituted by him
   for that end. In the compassing and effecting of this great work, God
   dealeth with men under a twofold consideration:--

   1. As rational creatures. So he discovers to them the end promised,
   with its excellency, loveliness, and satisfaction, thereby stirring up
   in them desires after it, as that eminent and proportioned good which
   they, in the utmost issue of their thoughts and desires, aim at.
   Farther; on the forementioned account, that they are rational
   creatures, endued with a rational appetite or will for the choosing of
   that which is good, and with an understanding to judge of it, and of
   the means for the attainment of the end, God reveals to them the means
   conducing to the end, proposing them to them, to be chosen, and
   embraced, and closed withal, for the compassing of the end proposed.
   And that yet they may be dealt withal agreeably to their nature and
   those principles in them which they are created withal, and that God
   might have glory by their acting suitably to such a nature and such
   principles, he exhorts and provokes them to choose those ways and means
   which he hath so allotted (as before mentioned) for the end aimed at;
   and that they should be thus dealt withal, their very natural
   condition, of being free, intellectual agents, doth require.

   2. As sinners, or agents disenabled in themselves for the work
   prescribed to them and required of them for the attaining of the end
   they aim at, -- namely, in spiritual things; and on that account he
   puts forth towards them and in them the efficacy of his power for the
   immediate and special working of those things in them and by them
   which, as rational creatures bound unto an orderly obedience, they are
   pressed and exhorted unto.

   To manifest the inconsistency of such a procedure, and the
   unanswerableness of it to the infinite wisdom of God (though the
   Scriptures expressly deliver it in innumerable places, as hath been
   shown), is that which by Mr Goodwin is in this discourse attempted. His
   particular endeavour in the place under consideration is, to manifest
   that when God promiseth to bring about and effect any thing infallibly,
   by the use of means, it is in vain altogether that any exhortation
   should be urged on them who are to use the means so appointed for the
   accomplishment of it. And to the instance above mentioned concerning
   Paul he replies, chap. xiii. sect. 8:--

   "First, it is the generally received opinion of divines, that promises
   of temporal good things are still conditional, and not absolute; which
   opinion they maintain upon grounds not easily shaken. Now, evident it
   is that the promise under question was a promise of this nature and
   kind, relating only to the preservation of the temporal lives of men."

   Ans. That all promises of temporal things, without exception, are
   conditional, -- that is, so as to be suspended on any conditions not
   promised to be wrought with equal assurance to that which depends on
   them, -- is not the judgment of any divine I know, unless it be of Mr
   Goodwin, and those of the same persuasion with him in the matter of our
   present controversy. Who ever but they will say (if they will) that the
   promise of bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt was
   conditional? Let them that do say so assign the condition on which the
   accomplishment of that promise was suspended. The promise made to the
   parents of Samson of his birth and mighty actions, what condition was
   it suspended on? and yet was it a promise of a temporal thing. Though
   this may be accounted a general rule, because for the most part it is
   so, yet may not God make a particular exception thereunto? Did he not
   so in the case of Hezekiah, as to his living fifteen years, as also in
   those cases before mentioned? It is true, all such promises have
   appointed means for their accomplishment, but not as conditions whereon
   their fulfilling is absolutely suspended.

   But he adds, "Those words of Paul to the centurion and soldiers lately
   mentioned (Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be safe')
   undeniably prove the said promise to have been not absolute, but
   conditional; for in case God should have promised absolutely and
   without all exception that they should have been safe, Paul had plainly
   contradicted the truth of it by affirming, not that they should not,
   but that they could not be safe, otherwise than upon the condition of
   the mariners abiding in the ship."

   Ans. This is boldly ventured. God promiseth that the end shall be
   accomplished; Paul exhorteth to the use of the means for the attainment
   of that end, and in that contradicts the truth of God's promise, if it
   be not conditional. And why so? Who ever said that God promised that
   they should be safe and preserved in the neglect of means? They were
   men, and not stones, that God promised so to safeguard; and it was by
   his blessing upon means that he intended to preserve them: therefore he
   that stirred them up to the use of means contradicted the promise,
   unless it were conditional! Paul says, indeed, they could not be safe
   unless the mariners abode in the ship; not suspending the certainty of
   God's promise upon their continuance in the ship, but manifesting the
   means whereby God would bring about their safety.

   That which ensues in the two following exceptions (as Paul's persuading
   them to take meat, which conduced to their safety, and their casting
   the wheat into the sea for the same end) amounts no higher than the
   affirmations already considered, asserting that an infallible promise
   of an end to be attained by means, and an exhortation to the use of
   means, with the actual use of them on the account of their necessity as
   means, are inconsistent; which is plainly, without the least show of
   proof or truth, to beg the thing in question.

   Neither is his case in hand at all promoted by comparing this
   particular promise, given at such a time and season, with those general
   promises of earthly blessings made to the obedience of the Jews in the
   land of Canaan, mentioned Deut. xxviii. 1-14.

   As for that which, sixthly, follows in the 9th section, being a
   marvellous pretty discourse about the promise here made, as though it
   should be only this, that though the ship were lost and miscarried, yet
   none of them in it should perish thereby, -- merely upon the account of
   the ship's miscarrying, though on some other account they might be
   drowned at the same time, -- which, upon narrow scanning, he hath at
   last found out to be the sense of the place, [it] may well deserve the
   consideration of them who have nothing else to do; for my part, I have
   other employment.

   That which we affirm concerning the words of God by his angel to Paul
   is, that they were such a promise as could not but infallibly be
   accomplished, according to the tenor of what is in those words
   expressed; nor, in respect of the faithfulness of God, could it
   otherwise be but that it must so fall out and come to pass as was
   appointed, although the accomplishment of it was to be brought about,
   by the eminent blessing of God upon the means that were to be used by
   them to whom and concerning whom it was given.

   1. For first, the promise was not only concerning the mariners and the
   rest in the ship, for the preservation of whom the means formerly
   mentioned were used, but of Paul's appearance before Cæsar, -- a great;
   and eminent work whereunto he was designed, Acts ix. 15: "Fear not,
   Paul; thou must be brought before Cæsar," chap. xxvii. 24. Look, then,
   what infallibility in respect of the event there was as to Paul's
   appearance before Cæsar, the same there was in the preservation of the
   lives of the rest with him. Now, although the staying of the mariners
   from going out of the ship was a means that Paul was kept alive to be
   brought before Cæsar, yet can any one be so forsaken of common sense as
   to say that it was the condition of the purpose of God concerning the
   fulfilling of that testimony which, according to his appointment, Paul
   was to make at Rome with all the mighty and successful travail for the
   propagation of the gospel which he after this was engaged in? was it
   all now cast upon the fall of an uncertain condition, not at all
   determined of God as to its accomplishment? Doth the infinitely wise
   God delight to put the purposes of his heart, and those of so great
   concernment to the kingdom of his Son and his own glory, in the
   everlasting welfare of innumerable souls, to such uncertain hazards,
   which, by various ways obvious and naked before his eyes, he could have
   prevented?

   2. It is part of the prediction of Paul, from the promise he had
   received (and therewith a revelation thereof), that they should be
   "cast upon a certain island," God having some work for him there to do.
   Now, was this part of the promise conditional, or no? If it be said
   that it was, let the condition on which it depended be assigned.
   Nothing can be imagined, unless it be that the wind sat in such or such
   a quarter. It is, then, supposed that God promised Paul and his company
   should be cast on an island for their preservation, provided the wind
   served for that end or purpose! But who, I pray, commands the winds and
   seas? Doth the wind so "blow where it listeth" as not to be at the
   command of its Maker? Is it not enough that we cast off his yoke and
   sovereignty from man, but must the residue of the creation be forced so
   to pay their homage to our free wills as to be exempted thereby from
   God's disposal? If this part of the promise were infallible and
   absolute as to the certainty of its accomplishment, why not the other
   part of it also?

   3. Paul makes confession of his faith to the company concerning the
   accomplishment of this promise. "I believe God," saith he, hoti houtos
   estai kath' hon tropon lelaletai moi, -- "it shall so come to pass in
   the same manner as it was told me;" clearly engaging the truth and
   faithfulness of that God which he worshipped (for his testimony to
   whose truth he was then in bonds) for the accomplishment of what he had
   spoken to them, -- namely, that not one of them should be lost. Now,
   supposing that any one person had, by any accident, fallen out of the
   ship, Mr Goodwin tells you there had been no opportunity or possibility
   left unto God to have fulfilled his promise. True, for it had been
   wholly frustrated, he having undertaken for the lives of every one of
   them. But supposing that engagement of his, he that says any one might
   have so perished is more careful, doubtless, to defend his own
   hypothesis than the honour of the truth and faithfulness of God.

   Evident then it is, notwithstanding the tortures, racks, and wheels,
   applied by Mr Goodwin to this text, with the confession pretended (and
   but pretended) to be extorted from it (which but that it hath gotten
   sanctuary under his name and wing would be counted ridiculous), that
   here is a promise of God making an event infallible and necessary in
   respect of its relation thereto, by a clear consistency with
   exhortations to the use of free and suitable means for the
   accomplishment of the thing so promised.

   Sect. 10. He objects farther to himself, "That in sundry places of
   Scripture, as 1 Cor. x. 12, 13, Phil. ii. 12, 13, Heb. vi. 4-6, 9,
   there are promises of perseverance and exhortations unto it joined
   together; and therefore men who deny a regular and due consistency
   between them do impute folly and weakness to the Holy Ghost." Whereunto
   he answers sundry things, to the end of the 11th section; as, --

   First, "They are many degrees nearer to the guilt of the crime
   specified who affirm the conjunction mentioned to be found in the said
   scriptures, than they who deny the legitimacy of such a conjunction.
   The incongruity of the conjunction hath been sufficiently evinced, but
   that any such conjunction is to be found either in the scriptures
   quoted, or in any others, is no man's vision but his who hath darkness
   for vision."

   Ans. If our adversary's ipse dixit may pass current, we shall quickly
   have small hopes left of carrying on the cause under consideration. All
   our testimonies must be looked upon as cashiered long since from
   attending any longer on the trial in hand, and all our arguments as
   blown away like flies in the summer. The very things here in question,
   -- namely, that there is an inconsistency between promises of
   perseverance and exhortations to the use of the means whereby it may be
   effected, that God hath made no such promises, or appointed no such
   exhortations, and that those who apprehend any such things have
   darkness for vision, -- are all confirmed by the renewed stamp of teste
   meipso; to which proof I shall only say, "Valeat quantum valere
   potest."

   But he adds, "That in none of the places cited is there any promise of
   perseverance is evident to him that shall duly consider the tenor and
   import of them.

   "For, first, it is one thing to say and teach that God will so limit as
   well the force as the continuance of temptations, that the saints may
   be able to bear, another to make a promise of absolute perseverance;
   yea, these very words, That ye may be able to bear it,' clearly import
   that all that is here promised unto the believing Corinthians is an
   exhibiting of means to perseverance, if they wilt improve them
   accordingly, not an infallible certainty of their perseverance. And
   that caveat, Let him that thinketh he stands take heed lest he fall,'
   plainly supposeth a possibility of his falling who thinketh, upon the
   best grounds, that he standeth sure. For that this caveat was not given
   to hypocrites or unsound believers, or to such who please themselves
   with a loose and groundless conceit of the goodness of their condition
   God-ward, is evident, because it were better that such men should fall
   from their present standing of a groundless conceit than continue their
   standing, nor would the apostle have ever cautioned such to take heed
   of falling away whose condition was more like to be made better than
   worse by their falling. And, besides, to understand the said caveat of
   loose believers overthrows the pertinency of it to their cause who
   insist upon it to prove a due consistency between exhortations to
   perseverance and promises to perseverance, as is evident. If, then, it
   be directed to true and sound believers, it clearly supposeth a
   possibility, at least, of their falling in case they shall not take
   heed, or else their taking heed would be no means, at least no
   necessary means, of their standing; and farther, it supposeth also a
   possibility, at least, of their non-taking heed, or that they might
   possibly not take heed hereof, otherwise the caveat or admonition had
   been in vain. Men have no need of being admonished to do that which
   they are under no possibility to omit. If, then, the standing or
   persevering of the saints depends upon their taking heed lest they
   fall, and their taking heed in this kind be such a thing which they may
   possibly omit, evident it is that there is a possibility of their
   non-persevering."

   Ans. This last division of the 10th section labours to evince that in
   the first of the places above mentioned, namely, 1 Cor. x. 12, 13,
   there is not a promise of perseverance in conjunction with exhortations
   unto the use of means unto that end. The words are, "Wherefore let him
   that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. There hath no
   temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful,
   who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will
   with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to
   bear it." But, --

   1. It is not in the least measure necessary, nor can be upon any
   account whatever required of us, that we should produce texts of
   Scripture in an immediate dependence and coherence in the same place,
   containing both the promises and exhortations mentioned, they being,
   for the most part, proposed upon most different accounts, and for
   immediately different ends and purposes; -- the one (namely), as in the
   revelation of them, respecting our consolation, the other our
   obedience. Nor can they ever the more be denied to be in a conjunction
   and consistency, though they are not to be found but in different
   places of Scripture (which that they are, especially as to that case
   which is questioned, hath been abundantly declared), than if they were
   still combined in the same coherence and connection of words. But yet,
   --

   2. I say there is, in the place forenamed, a most pathetical
   exhortation to the use of the means whereby we may persevere, and a
   most infallible promise that we shall so persevere, and not by any
   temptation whatever be utterly cast down or separated from God in
   Christ: the first in verse 12, "Wherefore, let him that thinketh he
   standeth take heed lest he fall," and verse 14, "Wherefore, my dearly
   beloved, flee from idolatry;" the latter in verse 13, "There hath no
   temptation taken you," etc. First, That there is an exhortation to the
   use of means for perseverance is not denied by our author, but granted,
   with an attempt to improve it for the furtherance of his own design.
   That there is a promise also of perseverance is no less evident. The
   diversion and turning away of any believer from God must be by
   temptation. Temptations are of various sorts, both in respect of their
   immediate rise, nature, and efficiency. Whatever (whence ever it
   proceed) turns from God, more or less, in part or in whole, as is
   imagined, is temptation. Now, the apostle here engageth the
   faithfulness of God in the preservation of believers from the power of
   temptation, so as it shall not prevail against them to the end before
   specified. "God," saith he, "is faithful;" and there is no need of his
   mentioning that property of God, which is his immutable constancy in
   the performance of his promises, but only to assure believers that he
   will preserve them as he hath spoken. The thing promised by the apostle
   in the name of God is (not only that the saints may be able to bear
   temptations that shall befall them, huper ho dunasthe, and tou
   dunasthai humas hupenenkein, having quite another importance than what
   is here intimated in the expression "May be able," in capital letters),
   that he will not suffer any temptation to come upon them that shall be
   above that strength, and prevalent against it, which he will
   communicate to them; and for those which do befall them, he will make
   way for their escaping, that with and by the strength received they may
   bear them. So that not only sufficiency of means to persevere, but
   perseverance itself by those means, and God's ordering all things so in
   his faithfulness that no assault shall befall them above the power of
   the strength given them to bear, is here asserted. Now, the promise
   here given is either absolute or conditional If absolute, -- that is,
   so far as that it shall infallibly be accomplished, not so depending on
   any thing that, in respect of the event, may or may not be as to be
   left at an uncertainty for its fulfilling, -- it is all that is of us
   desired. If it shall be said that it is conditional, I desire that the
   condition from whence it is said so to be may be assigned. If it shall
   be said (as it is) that it is "in case they willingly suffer not
   themselves to be overcome of temptations," I ask whether the strength
   and ability that God affords to his saints to resist temptations be not
   in the strengthening and confirming of their wills against them? and if
   so, whether this promise so interpreted doth not resolve itself into
   this proposition, "I will not suffer my saints to be overborne by
   temptations above the strength I will give them to bear, provided they
   be not pressed with temptations above the strength I give unto them."
   The promise, then, is absolute, either that no temptations shall befall
   believers above that they have received, or, that strength not to be
   overcome shall be afresh communicated to them upon the assaults of any
   new temptations.

   3. This being established, that here is a firm promise of perseverance,
   against which Mr Goodwin opposeth scarce any thing at all, and nothing
   at all to the purpose, his whole ensuing discourse falls of itself: for
   from the caveat used at the entrance of this promise and the
   exhortation at the close, both tending to stir up the saints, to whom
   the promise is made (many of whom have no distinct assurance of their
   interest in this or any other promise), to be heedfully careful in
   using the means of perseverance and avoiding the sins that in their own
   nature tend to the interruption of it, no other possibility of falling
   away can be concluded but such as may have a consistency with the
   faithfulness of God in the promise he hath given; -- that is, a
   possibility, as they say, "in sensu diviso," without respect had to the
   infallibly preventing causes of it, not "in sensu composito," not a
   possibility in reference to the nature of the things themselves; which
   is a sufficient bottom for caveats to be given and exhortations to be
   made to them concerned in them, none at all in respect of the purposes
   and promises of God, infallibly preventing the reducing into act of
   that possibility. These exceptions then notwithstanding, it appears
   that in 1 Cor. x. 12, 13, there is a conjunction of a gracious promise
   of perseverance with effectual exhortations to the use of means whereby
   we may persevere; and, consequently, they who "deny a due consistency
   between them do impute folly or weakness to the Holy Ghost." Hoper edei
   deixai.

   He proceeds to the next place pointed to by himself to prove
   consistency between promises and exhortations, under consideration, to
   wit., Phil. ii. 12, 13, "Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always
   obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence,
   work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God
   which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
   Evident it is that you have here conjoined by the Holy Ghost as weighty
   and pathetical an exhortation as he almost anywhere useth in the
   Scripture, with an assertion of grace as eminently operative and
   effectual as by any means can be expressed.

   "But," saith he, "it is one thing to affirm that God worketh in men as
   to will, so to do,' -- that is, to enable men to do or put in execution
   what they first will, or to assist in the doing or executing itself, --
   another to promise to work infallibly, and without all possibility of
   frustration, in men perseverance. There is little or no affinity
   between these. But how and in what sense God is said to be energon,
   working in men both to will and to do of his good pleasure, we shall
   have occasion to open more at large in the latter part of this work."

   Ans. I dare say an indifferent reader will conclude that Mr Goodwin was
   very hard put to it for an answer, finding him contenting himself with
   such sorry shifts and evident pervertings of the words of the text as
   those here mentioned. For, first, How come the words to be changed into
   a working, "as to will, so to do?" that is, perhaps, neither the one
   nor the other; -- who taught him to render kai to thelein, kai to
   energein, "as to will, so to do?" But, secondly, The chief of the sport
   made with the words consists in the exposition given of them as they
   lie in this new translation: "To work in them as to will, so to do, --
   that is, to do what they first will; not that he works in them to will,
   but that he assists them in doing what they first will." But what is
   now become of the tàm quàm above mentioned? how doth he work in them as
   to will, so to do, if he only assists them in doing what of themselves,
   without his assistance, they first will? Rather than it shall be
   granted that God by his grace works effectually on the wills of men, to
   the producing of their elicit acts of believing and obedience, any
   course may be warranted for the perverting of the expressions where
   such an operation seems to be held out. Perhaps this persuasion also,
   of the efficacy of the grace of God on the wills of men, is such that
   if it be found in any place of Scripture to be declared or asserted, it
   is enough to make wise and considering, prudent men to question their
   authority. But, thirdly, saith he, "This is not infallibly to work
   perseverance." I say, Show what else is required to perseverance but to
   "will and to do" according to the mind of God, which of his own good
   pleasure he promiseth effectually to work in believers, and you say
   something that may render your reasonings considerable. But it seems we
   must be kept in abeyance for an answer to this, until his criticism be
   ready to manifest how God is said to be energon, "working in men,"
   perhaps what is never wrought without any such effect as is imagined.
   What may by him be brought forth to this purpose time will show. But if
   he be able to make Ho Theos estin ho energon en humin, "God is working
   in you to will and to do," forsooth, from the participial expression of
   the verb, he will manifest more skill in Greek than he hath hitherto in
   divinity in all his learned treatises. So that here is a second
   instance of a conjunction of promises of perseverance with exhortations
   to use the means suited thereunto; which whoso denies to have a just
   and sweet consistency, doth charge the Holy Ghost with folly or
   weakness. Hoper edei deixai.

   Thirdly, The verses pointed to out of Heb. vi. 4-6, 9, do not so
   directly express the conjunction insisted on as those places already
   considered do; only, the discourse there used by the apostle is
   peremptory, that men may, without any disparagement to their wisdom or
   reason, earnestly deal with others and exhort them to avoid falling
   away from God, though they are fully persuaded that those whom they so
   exhort, by the help of those exhortations, and upon other
   considerations, shall abide with God to the end, or be attended with
   things accompanying salvation. But had Mr Goodwin been pleased to look
   to the following verses, wherein the apostle gives an account of the
   ground of this persuasion of his, he might have found something to
   exercise the best of his skill upon. The words are, "Beloved, we are
   persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation,
   though we thus speak. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work
   and labour of love, which ye have showed toward his name, in that ye
   have ministered to the saints, and do minister. And we desire that
   every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of
   hope unto the end." He tells them, verse 10, it is upon the account of
   the righteousness of God in carrying on the work of their labour of
   love, which was begun in them, and which they had shown or manifested,
   that he had this persuasion concerning them; which, in the ensuing
   verses, he farther pursues, clearing up the engagement of the
   righteousness of God in his oath: of which elsewhere. So that,
   notwithstanding any thing attempted to the contrary, evident it is
   that, in carrying on the work of our salvation, the Holy Ghost doth
   make use of promises of effectual grace for perseverance and eminent
   exhortations to abide with God, in such a harmony and consistency as is
   well suited to the things themselves, and in a course which takes
   sanctuary under the shade of his wisdom from all the charges of folly
   and weakness which poor, weak, and foolish men may, under their
   temptations and in their darkness, rise up against it withal. Whether
   there are express promises of perseverance in the Scripture, some
   advantage I hope will be given to the pious reader to judge from what
   hath been spoken, and what, by the Lord's assistance, may yet be
   insisted on to that purpose.

   Unto this debate about the exhortations of the word we find a discourse
   of the same nature and importance subjoined about the threatenings that
   are therein; which, as it is asserted, are rendered useless and
   ineffectual for the end whereunto they are of God appointed by that
   doctrine of perseverance which is opposed. We freely acknowledge that
   if any doctrine whatever do enervate and render vain any ordinance or
   institution of God, as to the ends and purposes whereunto it is of him
   appointed, that that doctrine is not of God, whose paths are all plain
   and equal, and whose commands do not interfere one with another. Now,
   that the principles of the doctrine of perseverance do destroy the
   efficiency of threatenings is attempted to be proved by an induction of
   observations, which, being the sum of all that is spoken to this head,
   must be transcribed at large, and is as followeth:--

   Sect. 12, "If the principles of the doctrine we speak of dissolve the
   efficiency of the said threatenings towards the end for the
   accomplishment whereof they are given, then they render them unsavoury,
   useless, and vain; but the principles of this doctrine are guilty of
   this offence: ergo. The terms of the major proposition are sufficient
   witness of the truth thereof. In order to the proof of the minor, we
   suppose, 1. That the end intended by God in such threatenings, which
   threaten those that shall apostatize with eternal death, is to prevent
   apostasy in the saints, and to work or cause them to persevere. 2. That
   this is one of the principles of the common doctrine of perseverance,
   God hath absolutely promised final perseverance unto the saints;' and
   this another, God will certainly, unfrustrably, and infallibly work
   this perseverance in the saints.' These two things only supposed, the
   light of the truth of the said minor proposition breaks forth from
   between them with much evidence and power. For, first, If the said
   threatenings be intended by God for the prevention of the apostasy of
   the saints, and consequently to effect their perseverance, the way and
   manner wherein this end intended by God is to be effected by them must
   needs be by their ingenerating or raising a fear or apprehension in the
   saints of eternal death, it being the native property of fear, mixed
   with hope, to awaken and provoke men to the use of such means which are
   proper to prevent the danger or evil feared. There is no other way
   imaginable how or whereby the threatenings we speak of should operate
   towards the perseverance of the saints, for the preventing of their
   apostasy, but that mentioned, -- namely, by working in them a fear or
   dread of the evil threatened. Therefore, secondly, Evident it is that
   such promises made, and made known unto the saints, by which they are
   made incapable of any such fear, are absolutely destructive of the
   efficiency which is proper to the mid threatenings to exhibit, towards
   the prevention of apostasy in the saints, or for the causing of them to
   persevere. And, lastly, It is every whit as evident that such promises
   whereby God should assure the saints that they shall not apostatize,
   but persevere, are apt and proper to render them incapable of all fear
   of eternal death; and, consequently, are apparently obstructive of, and
   destructive unto, the native tendency of the said threatenings towards
   and about the perseverance of the saints. These threatenings can do
   nothing, contribute nothing, towards the perseverance of the saints,
   but by the mediation of the fear of evil in them upon their
   non-persevering; therefore, whatsoever hardens them against this fear,
   or renders them incapable of it, supersedes all the virtue and vigour
   which are to be found in these threatenings for or towards the
   effecting of their perseverance."

   Ans. 1. Be it granted that one end of God in his threatenings is to
   prevent apostasy in the saints, by stirring them up to take careful
   heed to the ways and means whereby they may persevere, and that they no
   otherwise work, or cause perseverance, but as they so stir up and
   provoke men to the things wherein they are to abide; but this is not
   their only end. They are also discoveries to all the world of the
   severity of God against sin, and that it is his judgment that they who
   commit it are worthy of death.

   2. If by "Absolute promises of final perseverance" you intend such
   promises of perseverance, in and by the use of means instituted and
   appointed by God himself for the accomplishment of the end promised,
   which are not made or given upon the consideration of any worth in them
   to whom they are made, nor do depend, as to their accomplishment, on
   any such condition in them as in the event and issue may not be
   fulfilled, this observation also is granted. You may add, also, that
   God will certainly, effectually, and infallibly work in them an abiding
   with him to the end, or put his law in their hearts, that they shall
   never depart from him. If by "unfrustrably," also, you intend only that
   he will so work it as that his counsel and purpose shall not in the end
   be frustrated or disappointed, we grant that also, for he hath said
   "his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure."

   These things being thus supposed, let us try the inferences from them
   that must make good the former assertion concerning the frustration of
   the use of comminations by them; for they are singled out to bear the
   weight of this charge.

   To the first assumption, then, and inference, I say, there is a twofold
   fear of eternal death and destruction:-- 1. An anxious, perplexing
   fear, in respect of the end itself; 2. A watchful, careful fear, in
   respect of the means leading thereunto. In respect of the first, it is
   utterly denied that the use and end of the threatenings of God, in
   respect of his saints, are to ingenerate any such fear in them, it
   being directly opposed to that faith, assurance, peace, boldness,
   consolation, and joy, that God is pleased to afford to them, and
   abundantly exhorts them to live up unto: yea, an anxious, abiding fear
   of hell is fully contrary to that very conditional assurance of
   salvation which Mr Goodwin himself, in respect of their present
   condition, allows to them; nor hath the Lord instituted his ordinances
   at such a difference and opposition one to another as that, at the same
   time, towards the same persons, they should be effectual to beget
   opposite and contrary frames and principles. For the other, or a
   watchful, heedful fear, for the avoiding of the way and means that
   would lead them, and do lead others, to destruction, that is not in the
   least inconsistent with any assurance that God is pleased by his
   promises to give to his saints of their perseverance. God will have
   them expect their perseverance in the way wherein he hath promised it,
   -- that is, by the use of such and such means, helps, and advantages,
   as he hath appointed for the effectual accomplishment thereof; and
   therefore nothing is in vain or uselessly applied to them which,
   according to his appointment, is suited to the stirring of them up to
   the use of the means ordained for that end, as before mentioned.
   Therefore, to Mr Goodwin's second assertion, which he calls "evident,"
   I say, --

   First, That it is not the making, or the bare making known to
   the.saints, of the promises of God, that will work the end for which
   they are given to them, or enable them to mix them with faith; and
   according to the strength of that, and not according to the truth that
   is in the promises themselves, is their assurance of the things
   promised. And therefore, notwithstanding all the clear promises of
   perseverance which are made, and made known to them, we see very many
   of them not to come up to any such assurance thereof as to be freed
   from the first sort of fear mentioned, which yet is the proper issue of
   unbelief, to the begetting whereof in them God hath not instituted any
   ordinance. Secondly, That none of the saints of God are, by the
   promises of grace which we assert, freed from that fear which is the
   proper product and effect of God's comminations in respect of them; and
   therefore by them there is no obstruction laid in the way of the proper
   efficiency of those threatenings. What is added, in the third and last
   place, is only a repetition of what was before spoken, without any
   attempt of proof, unless he would have it looked upon as a conclusion
   from the premises, whose weakness being discovered as to the intent and
   purpose in hand, we need not farther trouble ourselves with it. Instead
   of Mr Goodwin's, now considered, take these few observations, which
   will give so much light into the whole matter under debate as may
   supersede his whole ensuing discourse:--

   First, then, It may be observed (as it was, by the way, in the
   foregoing discourse), that notwithstanding the promises of perseverance
   which are given to the saints, yet many there are who are not enabled
   all their days to mix them with faith, although their interest and
   portion lie in them no less than theirs who through grace attain the
   greatest assurance; and on that account they do never all their days
   get free from some bondage, by reason of the fear of death and
   destruction. And in respect of such as these, the comminations and
   threatenings insisted on may have much of that end accomplished which
   by Mr Goodwin is assigned to them; not that such a frame is directly
   aimed at in them, Christ dying to deliver them who by reason of death
   were in bondage all their days, from that bondage which the fear of
   death for sin doth keep the souls of men in and under, but that it
   follows, and will follow, upon their darkness and weakness of faith.

   Secondly, That the promises of perseverance being of the effecting and
   accomplishment of it by and in the use of means, do not, nor will, give
   deliverance to them to whom they are made from fear of death and hell,
   but only whilst they conscientiously use the means appointed for them
   to walk in; so that upon their deflection from the rule which is
   attended with mercy and peace, the threatenings of God to sin and
   sinners, to apostasy and apostates, do lay hold on them in their full
   force and efficacy, especially to the ingenerating in them "a terror of
   the Lord," as the apostle speaks, and an abhorrency of their ways, a
   loathing of them as not good, that would cause them to "fall into the
   hands of the living God." So that all Mr Goodwin's arguings, not being
   levied against the certainty of perseverance, but men's certainty that
   they shall persevere (which some never attain unto, some lose either in
   whole or in part oftentimes), are not to the business in hand.

   Thirdly, That eternal death and destruction is not the only subject of
   God's threatenings, nor all the evil that they may have a fear of whom
   he deals withal by them. Desertion, rejection, rebukes, sharp and keen
   arrows, blows of God's hand, temporal death itself, with the like, are
   also threatened; yea, and so often, in an eminent and dreadful manner,
   have been inflicted, that though they might be supposed to have always
   some comfortable assurance of deliverance from the wrath that is to
   come, yet the threatenings of God may be suited to beget in them this
   fear of evil to such a height as may make their "bowels to flow like
   water, rottenness to enter into their bones, and all their joints to
   tremble."

   Fourthly, That the end of the threatenings of God being to discover to
   men the connection that is, by his appointment, between the sins
   exagitated and the punishment threatened, whence the fear mentioned
   doth consequently ensue, they may obtain their full and primary effect
   though that fear be not ingenerated, if they be prevailed on by any
   other considerations, so that the sin be avoided.

   Fifthly, That when the saints do walk orderly, regularly, and closely
   with God, in the use of means by him appointed, and so doing, from the
   promises of perseverance, do receive a comfortable assurance that they
   shall be "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation,".the
   begetting in them of fears of death and hell is neither useful in
   itself nor are they intended of God to be their portion. But if at any
   time they "turn aside from the holy commandment," and thereby fail of
   the persuasion of their perseverance (as their faith will be by such
   means impaired), though the certainty of the thing itself be no less
   infallible than formerly, yet by the threatenings of God to them it may
   be needful to rouse them (by "the terror of the Lord" in them) from the
   condition whereinto they have cast themselves.

   I doubt not but that from the light of these and the like
   considerations, which might farther be insisted on, it will appear that
   there may be, and is, an harmonious consistency between the promises
   and threatenings of the Scripture, notwithstanding the mist that is
   raised in a long and tedious discourse to interrupt the evidence
   thereof.

   In the 13th section, under pretence of answering an objection, a long
   discourse is drawn forth farther to varnish over what was before
   spoken. Nothing of importance, to my best observation, being added, it
   may be reduced to these four heads:--

   First, An assertion, "That the threats against apostasy do not belong
   to hypocrites, -- that is, to them that are not really regenerate, let
   their profession be what it will; for hypocrites ought not to persevere
   in the way wherein they are to the end, and therefore there is no
   danger of their falling away from it;" -- which is a ridiculous piece
   of sophistry; for though they may not be exhorted to continue in their
   hypocrisy, which corrupts and vitiates their profession, yet they may
   in their profession, which in itself is good. And though there is no
   danger of leaving their hypocrisy, yet there is of their waxing worse
   and worse, by falling from the beginnings of grace which they have
   received, the profession which they have made, and the regular
   conversation which they have entered upon. So that, notwithstanding any
   thing said to the contrary, the comminations under consideration may
   principally belong to some kind of professors, who, notwithstanding all
   the gifts and common graces which they have received, yet in a large
   sense may be termed hypocrites, as they are opposed to them who have
   received the Spirit with true and saving grace.

   Secondly, He says, "It is evident that they belong unto true believers
   from Heb. vi. 4-6, 9, x. 26, 27, 29;" but if there were no better
   evidence of the concernment of true believers in the threatenings made
   to apostasy than what can be drawn from the places mentioned, I dare
   undertake that Mr Goodwin shall never prove any such concernment of
   theirs therein whilst his eyes are open. But about this I shall not at
   present contend.

   Thirdly, He tells us "That the end and aim of God in these threatenings
   is the good of believers:" of which, as far as they are concerned in
   them, I much less doubt than I do of the clearness of the proof of this
   assertion from Ps. lxxxv. 8, "I will hear what God the Lord will speak:
   for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let
   them not turn again to folly;" -- a place that I presume was hooked in
   here violently for want of a fitter opportunity to wrest it with a
   by-interpretation, because it looks so hardly on the doctrine which our
   author hath undertaken to defend. But let this pass also.

   His fourth assertion, which he pursues at large, or rather with many
   words, is, "That these threatenings have no tendency to the good of
   believers, but only by begetting in them a fear of hell and
   destruction; which that they ought to do is strongly proved from Luke
   xii. 4, 5, where we are bid to fear Him who can cast both body and soul
   into hell-fire." Now, though the logic of this argument doth scarce
   appear to me, nor the strength of the inference from the text, -- there
   being a great difference between fearing Him who can cast both body and
   soul into hell-fire and fearing of hell-fire, between fearing God for
   his severity and power, in opposition to the weakness and limitedness
   of persecutors (even whilst we "fear not their fear, but sanctify the
   Lord of hosts himself in our hearts, making him our fear and our
   dread"), and such a fear of punishment as is inconsistent with the
   promises of God that we shall be preserved in obedience, and so be free
   from it, -- yet I shall consider the following discourse that is built
   thereon. Supposing all that Mr Goodwin observes from this text, and
   that the reason of the fear here enjoined is taken from the power of
   God to cast into hell, yet the whole of the argument thence amounts but
   thus far: "Because such who are threatened to be persecuted by men, who
   can only kill their bodies, ought rather to fear God, who can extend
   his power of punishing to the destruction of body and soul of those
   that offend him; therefore there is such a fear ingenerated in the
   saints by the threatenings of the word as is inconsistent with the
   truth of God's steadfastness in his covenant with them to keep them up
   to obedience unto the end.

   Sect. the 14th, he farther pleads from Heb. xi. 7, 2 Kings xxii. 19,
   20, "That the eminentest, holiest men that live may do many things from
   a principle of fear, or of being afraid of the judgments of God, that
   they should come upon them; and upon that account have been put upon
   ways that were acceptable to God."

   Ans. We know that the "fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,"
   and the "fear of the Lord and his goodness" is a great mercy of the
   covenant of grace. This is not the thing here pleaded for. It is a
   thing quite of another nature, even that ascribed to the strange
   nations that were transplanted into Samaria by the king of Assyria,
   upon the captivity and removal of the ten tribes, and frightened by
   lions, that destroyed some of them, who did yet continue to worship
   their own idols, under the dread of God which was upon them, which is
   called "The fear of the Lord." To complete this fear, it is required
   that a man have such an apprehension of the coming of hell and wrath
   upon him as that he be not relieved against it by any interposal of
   promise, or aught else, from God, that he should be preserved in the
   way and path whereby he shall assuredly find deliverance from that
   which he fears. How far this kind of fear, the fear of hell, -- not as
   declarative of the terror of the Lord, but as probable to betide and
   befall the person so fearing it, and that solely considered as an evil
   to himself, -- may be a principle of any act of acceptable gospel
   obedience, is not cleared by Mr Goodwin, nor easily will be so; for, --

   1. That it is not the intendment of any divine threatenings to beget
   such a fear, in reference to them that believe, hath been declared.

   2. It is no fruit or product of the Spirit of life and love; which, as
   hath been shown, is the principle of all our obedience and walking with
   God.

   3. It holds out a frame of spirit directly contrary to what we are
   called and admitted unto under the gospel; for "God hath not given us
   the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind," 2
   Tim. i. 7: and Rom. viii. 15, "Ye have not received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,
   whereby we cry, Abba, Father." The spirit of this fear and dread, and
   the bondage that attends it, is at open variance with the Spirit of
   liberty, boldness, power, adoption, and a sound mind, wherewith
   believers are endued. And, --

   4. It is that which the Lord Christ intended to remove and take away
   from his by his death: Heb. ii. 15, He died that he might "deliver them
   who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."

   This fear, then, I say, which is neither promise of the covenant, nor
   fruit of the Spirit, nor product of saving faith, will scarce, upon
   strict inquiry, be found to be any great furtherer of the saints'
   obedience. What use the Lord is pleased to make of this dread and
   terror in the hearts of any of his, for the hedging up their ways from
   folly, and staving them off from any actual evil, when, through the
   strength of temptation, they do begin to cast off the law of life and
   love whereby they are governed, is not in the least prejudiced by any
   thing asserted in the doctrine of the saints' perseverance. Towards
   some, who, though they are persuaded of the perseverance of the saints
   indefinitely, yet have no persuasion, or at least no prevailing
   cheering assurance, that themselves are saints (which Mr Goodwin thinks
   to be the condition of far the greatest part of believers), it hath its
   full power and extent, its whole efficacy depending on the
   apprehensions of the mind wherein it is. Towards the residue, who upon
   abiding grounds and sure foundations have obtained a comfortable
   spiritual persuasion of their own interest in the promises of God, that
   the consideration of hell and judgment, as the due debt of sin and
   necessary vindication of the glory of God, hath also its effect and
   influence, as far as God is pleased to exercise them therewith,
   acquainting them continually with his terror, and filling them with an
   abhorrency of those ways which in and of themselves tend to so dismal
   an end and issue, hath been declared.

   The places of Scripture mentioned by Mr Goodwin doubtless will not
   reach his intendment. Of Noah is is said that he was eulabetheis after
   he was chrematistheis. Being warned of God of that flood that was for
   to come upon the world of ungodly men, and the salvation of himself and
   his family by the ark, being filled with the reverence of God, and
   assured of his own preservation, he industriously sets himself about
   the use of the means whereby it was to be accomplished. That because a
   man assured of an end from God himself, in and by the use of means,
   did, with reverential fear of God, not of any evil threatened, which he
   was to be preserved from, set himself to a conscientious use of means
   whereby the promised end of God's own institution is to be brought
   about, therefore the fear of hell (such a fear as hath been described)
   is one principle of the obedience of the saints in their walking with
   God, and such as they ought to cherish, as being a means appointed of
   God for that end and purpose, is an argument of no great value here
   with us. Neither, surely, will the conclusion intended be more
   evidently educed from the tenderness of the heart of Josiah under the
   preaching of the law, mentioned in the second place; and therefore I
   shall not need to call it into examination.

   But it is added farther, sect. 14, p. 314, "The present state and frame
   of the hearts and souls of the saints, duly considered, which are made
   up as well of flesh and corruption as of Spirit and grace, the former
   having need of bridles for restraint, as well as the latter of spurs
   for quickening, evident it is that arguments or motives drawn from fear
   of punishment are as necessary and proper for them in respect of the
   one as incitements from love in respect of the other. A whip for the
   home,' says Solomon, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's
   back.' The flesh, even in the wisest of men, is a fool, and would be
   unruly without a rod ever and anon shaken over it; nor should God have
   made such gracious, bountiful, and effectual provision for the
   perseverance of the saints as now he hath done, had he not engaged as
   well the passion of fear within them as of love to be their guardian
   keeper. It is true, perfect love casteth out fear,' but who amongst the
   saints themselves can say either that his heart is clean or his love
   perfect? Perfect love casteth out flesh as well as fear; yea, true
   love, until flesh be cast out, preserveth fear for its assistant and
   fellow-helper. The flesh would soon make love a wanton, and entice her
   unto folly, did not fear dissolve the enchantment and protect her
   chastity."

   Of this last division of the 14th section there are two parts; -- the
   first confirmative of what was spoken before concerning the usefulness
   of the fear of hell and punishment for the furthering of the saints'
   obedience; the other responsatory to what is urged to the contrary from
   1 John iv. 18, "Perfect love casteth out fear." For the first, it is
   granted that there are those two contrary principles of flesh and
   spent, corruption and grace, in the hearts of all, even the best and
   most eminent saints, whilst they continue here below. But that these
   two should be principles acting themselves in their obedience, the one
   moved, incited, and stirred up by love, the other from the fear whereof
   we are speaking, is a fleshly, dark, and-evangelical conceit. That the
   principle in believers which the Scripture calls "flesh" and
   "corruption" needs incitement to obedience, or is to be incited
   thereunto, as is affirmed, is no less corrupt than what was before
   mentioned. Look, whatsoever influence flesh or corruption hath into any
   of our obedience, so far that obedience is vitiated, corrupted,
   rendered unclean, and unacceptable before God. The flesh is to be
   crucified, slain, destroyed, not stirred up and provoked to obedience,
   being indeed disobedience in the abstract, -- enmity to God. You may as
   well persuade darkness to shine as the flesh to obey. It is not "a
   fool" (as that allusion bespeaks it from Prov. xxvi. 3), "that would be
   unruly were not a rod ever and anon shaken over him," but it is folly
   itself, that is not to be cured, but killed, -- not stirred up, but
   mortified. How that is to be done hath been formerly at large declared.
   It is by the Spirit's bringing the cross and power of the death of
   Christ into the heart of the sinner, and not by any consideration of
   hell and punishment that we can take upon ourselves, -- who never did,
   nor ever will, mortify any sin to the end of the world, -- that this
   work is to be wrought.

   Secondly, That which is added of "God's bountiful provision for the
   perseverance of the saints, by engaging the passion of fear as well as
   love," is of no better a frame or constitution than that which went
   before. That our gracious Father hath made fuller, larger, and more
   certain, provision for our perseverance than any that can be afforded
   by the engaging of our passions by consideration of punishment or
   reward, I hope hath been sufficiently demonstrated. And if Mr Goodwin
   intend no more by his love and fear of God than the engaging of those
   natural passions in us by the considerations intimated, I shall not be
   rival with him in his persuasion. The love we intend is a fruit of the
   Spirit of God in us, and the fear contended about is of the spirit of
   bondage; which, though it be not pressed on us as our duty, yet we hope
   that [such] bountiful provision is made for our perseverance as shall
   effectually support and preserve us to the end. Blessed be his name,
   his saints have many better guardians and keepers than a bondage frame
   of spirit upon the account of the wrath to come, from whence they are
   delivered by Christ! They are in his own hand, and in the hand of his
   Son, and are kept through faith by his power to salvation. If this be
   the end of Mr Goodwin's preaching the threatenings of God at any time,
   namely, that, the natural passion of fear being stirred up with the
   apprehensions of hell, the flesh that is in man may be incited to
   obedience, I hope he hath not many consenting with him in the same
   intendment.

   Thirdly, To an objection framed from 1 John iv. 18, that "perfect love
   casteth out fear," he tells us, first, "That it may be so, but whose
   love is perfect?" secondly, "That love cherisheth fear, until the flesh
   be quite cast out;" thirdly, "That the flesh would make love wanton and
   entice it to folly, did not fear dissolve the enchantment." But, --

   1. Though love be not perfect to all degrees of perfection here, yet it
   may have, yea it hath, in the saints, the perfection of uprightness and
   sincerity; which is all that is here intended, and all that is required
   to it for the casting out of that tormenting fear of which the apostle
   speaks. "Fear," saith he, "hath torment;" and if our love cannot amount
   to such perfection as to cast it out, it being only to be cast out
   thereby, it is impossible we should ever be freed from torment all our
   days, or be filled with joy and consolation in believing; which would
   frustrate the glorious design of God, which he hath sworn himself
   willing to pursue, Heb. vi. 17, 18, and the great end of the death of
   Christ, which he hath perfectly accomplished, chap. ii. 14, 15.

   2. It is true, there is a fear that love cherisheth, -- the fear that
   God hath promised in the covenant of grace to preserve in our hearts
   all our days; but to say it cherisheth the fear we speak of, and which
   the Holy Ghost in this place intendeth, is expressly to make the Holy
   Ghost a liar, and to contradict him to his face.

   3. What love in us is that that the flesh can or may "entice to folly?"
   Are the fruits of the Spirit of God, the graces of his own working and
   creating in us, of such a temper and constitution as that they may be
   enticed to uncleanness and folly? And is it possible that such a
   thought should enter into the heart of a man professing the doctrine of
   the gospel? that ink should stain paper with such filth cast upon the
   Spirit and grace of God? The fear of hell erewhile was suited to the
   use of the flesh, but now, it seems, it serves to keep the love of God
   itself in order, that otherwise would wax wanton, fleshly, and foolish!
   Foolish love, that will attempt to cast out this tormenting fear, not
   being able to preserve itself from folly without its assistance!

   Sect. 15 is spent in an answer endeavoured to an objection placed in
   the beginning of it, in these words:--

   "If it be farther demanded, But doth it not argue servility in men to
   be drawn by the iron cord of the fear of hell to do what is their duty
   to do? or doth any other service or obedience become sons and children
   but only that which is free and proceedeth from love?'?"

   Hereunto you have a threefold answer returned:--

   First, "That God requires that it should be so;" which is a downright
   begging of the question.

   Secondly, He puts a difference between the obedience of children to
   their parents and of the saints unto God, the discourse whereof
   discovering some mysteries of the new doctrine of grace, much pressed
   and insisted on, take as follows:-- "There is a very different
   consideration of the obedience of children to their natural parents,
   and of the obedience of the children of God unto their heavenly Father.
   The obedience of the former is but by the inspiration of nature, and is
   an act not so much raised by deliberation or flowing from the will, by
   an interposure of judgment and conscience to produce the election, as
   arising from an innate propension in men, accompanying the very
   constituting principles of their nature and being; whereas the latter,
   the obedience of the children of God, is taught by precepts, and the
   principle of it, I mean that rational frame of heart out of which they
   subject themselves to God, is planted in the souls of men by the
   engagement of reason, judgment, and conscience, to consider those
   grounds, arguments, and motives, by which their heavenly Father judgeth
   it meet to work and fashion them unto such a frame. So that though the
   obedience of natural children to their natural parents be the more
   genuine and commendable when it flows freely from the pure instinct of
   nature, and is not drawn from them by fear of punishment, yet the
   obedience of the children of God is then most genuine and commendable,
   and like unto itself, when it is produced and raised in the soul by a
   joint influence and contribution, not of one, or of some, but of all
   those arguments, reasons, motives, inducements whatever, and how many
   soever they be, by which their heavenly Father useth to plant and work
   it in them; for in this case, and in this only, it hath most of God, of
   the Spirit of God, of the wisdom of God, of the goodness of God. In and
   upon this account it is likeliest to be most free, uniform, and
   permanent."

   The sum of this answer amounts to these three things:-- First, That
   there is an instinct or inspiration of nature in children to yield
   obedience to their parents. Secondly, That there is no such spiritual
   instinct or inclination in the saints to yield obedience to God.
   Thirdly, That the obedience of the saints ariseth merely and solely
   from such considerations of the reason of that obedience as they
   apprehend, in contradiction to any such genuine principles as might
   incline their hearts thereunto.

   1. For the first, that the obedience of children to their parents,
   though it be a prime dictate of the law of nature wherewith they are
   endued, proceedeth from a pure instinct, any otherwise than as a
   principle suiting and inclining them to the acts of that obedience, so
   as to exclude the promoting and carrying of it on upon the moral
   consideration of duty, piety, etc., it is in vain for Mr Goodwin to go
   about to persuade us, unless he could not only corrode the word of God,
   where it presseth that obedience as a duty, but also charm us into
   beasts of the field, which are acted by such a brute instinct, not to
   be improved, stirred up, or drawn forth into exercise by deliberation
   or consideration. There is, it is true, in children an impress of the
   power of the law of nature, suiting them to obedience (which yet in
   many hath been quite cast out and obliterated, being none of the
   constituting principles of their nature, which, whilst they have their
   being as such, cannot be thrown out of them), and carrying them out
   unto it with delight, ease, and complacency, as habits do to suitable
   actings; but withal that this principle is not regulated and directed,
   as our obedience to God, by a rule, and stirred up to exert itself, and
   [that] they in whom it is [are not] provoked by rational and
   conscientious considerations to the performance of their duty in that
   obedience, is so contrary to the experience, I suppose, of all sharers
   with us in our mortality, that it will hardly be admitted into debate.

   2. The worst part of this story lies in the middle of it, in the
   exclusion of any such spiritual principle in believers as should carry
   them out unto obedience, at least to any such as is not begotten in
   their minds by "rational considerations" Whatever may be granted of
   acquired habits of grace (which that the first should be, that a
   spiritual habit should be acquired by natural actings, is a most
   ridiculous fiction), all infused habits of grace that should imprint
   upon the soul a new natural inclination to obedience, that should
   fashion and frame the hearts of men into a state and condition suited
   for, and carry them out unto, spiritual obedience, are here decried.
   All, it seems, that the Scripture hath told us of our utter
   insufficiency, deadness, disability, indisposedness to any thing that
   is good, without a new life and principle; all that we have apprehended
   and believed concerning the new heart and Spirit given us, the new
   nature, new creature, divine nature, inner man, grace in the heart,
   making the root good that the fruit may be so; all that the saints have
   expressed concerning their delight in God, love to God upon the account
   of his writing his laws in their hearts and spirits, -- is a mere
   delusion. There is no principle of any heavenly, spiritual life, no new
   nature, with its bent and instinct lying towards God and obedience to
   him, wrought in the saints, or bestowed on them, by the Holy Spirit of
   grace. If this be so, we may even fairly shut our Bibles, and go learn
   this new gospel of such as are able to instruct us therein. Wherefore,
   I say, --

   3. That as in children there is an instinct, an inclination of nature,
   to induce them and carry them out to obedience to their natural
   parents, which yet is directed, regulated, provoked, and stirred up,
   and they thereby, to that obedience, by motives and considerations
   suited to work upon their minds and consciences, to prevail with them
   thereunto: so also in believers, the children of God, who are "begotten
   of the will of God," by the "word of truth," and "born again, not of
   the will of the flesh, but of the will of God," there is a new
   spiritual principle, a constituting principle of their spiritual lives,
   wrought and implanted in them by the Spirit of principle of faith and
   love, enabling them for, suiting them unto, and inciting them to, that
   obedience which is acceptable and well-pleasing to their Father which
   is in heaven; in which obedience, as they are regulated by the word, so
   they are stirred up unto it by all those motives which the Lord in his
   infinite wisdom hath fitted to prevail on persons endued with such a
   principle from himself as they are. It is not incumbent on me to enter
   upon the proof and demonstration of a title to a truth which the saints
   of God have held so long in unquestionable possession, nothing at all
   being brought to invalidate it but only a bare insinuation that it is
   not so. Then, --

   4. I deny not but that the saints of God are stirred up to obedience by
   all the considerations and inducements which God lays before them and
   proposeth to them for that end and purpose; and as he hath spread a
   principle of obedience over their whole souls, all their faculties and
   affections, so he hath provided in his word motives and inducements to
   the obedience he requires, which are suited unto and fit to work upon
   all that is within them (as the psalmist speaks) to live to him. Their
   love, fear, hope, desires, are all managed within and provoked without
   to that end and purpose. But how it will thence follow that it is the
   intendment of God by his threatenings to ingenerate such a fear of hell
   in them as is inconsistent with an assurance of his faithfulness in his
   promises not to leave them, but to preserve them to his heavenly
   kingdom, I profess I know not. The obedience of the saints we look upon
   to proceed from a principle wrought in them with a higher energy and
   efficacy than mere desires of God to implant it by arguments and
   motives; that is, by persuading them to it, without the least real
   contribution of strength or power, or the ingrafting the word in them,
   in, with, and by, a new principle of life. And if this be the Phyllis
   of our author's doctrine, solus habeto. Such a working of obedience we
   cannot think to have any thing "of God, of the Spirit of God, of the
   wisdom of God, or the goodness of God," in it; being exceedingly remote
   from the way and manner of God's working in the saints as held out in
   the word of truth, and ineffectual to the end proposed in that
   condition wherein they are. The true use of the threatenings of wrath,
   in reference to them who by Christ are delivered from it, hath been
   before manifested and insisted on.

   Thirdly, In the last division of this section, he labours to prove that
   what is done from a principle of fear may be done willingly and
   cheerfully, as well as that which is done from a principle of love. To
   which briefly I say, --

   1. Neither fear nor love, as they are mere natural affections, is any
   principle of spiritual obedience as such.

   2. That we are so far from denying the usefulness of the fear of the
   Lord to the obedience of the saints, that the continuance thereof in
   them to the end is the great promise, for the certain accomplishment
   whereof we do contend.

   3. That fear of hell in believers, as a part of the wrath of God from
   which they are delivered by Christ, being opposed to all their graces
   of faith, love, hope, etc., is no principle of obedience in them,
   whatever influence it may have on them as to restraint when managed by
   the hand of God's grace.

   4. That yet believers can never be delivered from it but by faith in
   the blood of Christ, attended with sincere and upright walking with
   God; which when they fail of, though that fear, supposed to be
   predominant in the soul, be inconsistent with any comfortable, cheering
   assurance of the favour of God, yet it is not with the certain
   continuance to them of the thing itself, upon the account of the
   promises of God.

   Sect. 16 contains a large discourse, in answer to the apostle affirming
   that "fear hath torment;" which is denied by our author, upon sundry
   considerations. The fear he intends is a fear of hell and "wrath to
   come." This he supposeth to be of such predominancy in the soul as to
   be a principle of obedience unto God. That this can be without torment,
   disquiet, bondage, and vexation, he will not easily evince to the
   consciences of them who have at any time been exercised under such a
   frame. What fear is consistent with hope; what incursions upon the
   souls of the saints are made by dread and bondage; the fears of hell,
   and the use of such fears; how some are, though true believers,
   scarcely delivered from such fears all their days, -- I have formerly
   declared. And that may suffice as to all our concernment in this
   discourse.

   In the 17th section somewhat is attempted as to promises, answerable to
   what hath been done concerning exhortations and threatenings. The words
   used to this end are many; the sum is, "That the use of promises in
   stirring men up to obedience is solely in the proposal of a good thing
   or good things to them to whom the promises are made, which they may
   attain or come short of. Now, if men are assured, as this doctrine
   supposeth they may be, that they shall attain the end whether they use
   the means or no, how can they possibly be incited by the promises to
   the use of the means proposed for the enjoyment of the end promised?"
   That this is the substance of his discourse I presume himself will
   confess; and it being the winding up of a tedious argument, I shall
   briefly manifest its uselessness and lay it aside. I say, then, --

   1. What is the true use of the promises of God, and what influence they
   have into the obedience and holiness of the saints, hath been formerly
   declared; neither is any thing there asserted of their genuine and
   natural tendency to the ends expressed enervated in the least by any
   thing here insisted on or intimated by Mr Goodwin: so that without more
   trouble I might refer the reader thither to evince the falseness of Mr
   Goodwin's assertions concerning the uselessness of the promises unto
   perseverance, upon a supposition that there are promises of
   perseverance.

   2. Though we affirm that all true saints shall persevere, yet we do not
   say that all that are so do know themselves to be so, and towards them,
   at least, the promises may have their efficacy in that way which Mr
   Goodwin hath by his authority confined them to work in.

   3. We say that our Saviour was fully persuaded that in the issue of his
   undertakings and sufferings he should be "glorified with his Father,"
   according to his promise; and yet, upon the account of that glory,
   which he was so assured of, being set before him, he addressed himself
   to the sharpest and most difficult passage to it that ever any one
   entered on. He "endured the cross, despising the shame," for the
   glory's sake whereof he had assurance, Heb. xii. 2. And why may not
   this be the state of them to whom, in his so doing, he was a captain of
   salvation? Why may not the glory and reward set before them, though
   enjoyed in a full assurance of faith, in the excellency of it, when
   possessed, as promised, stir them up to the means leading thereunto?

   4. The truth is, the more we are assured with the assurance of faith
   (not of presumption) that we shall certainly obtain and enjoy the end
   whereunto the means we use do lead (as is the assurance that ariseth
   from the promises of God), the more eminently are we pressed in a
   gospel way, if we walk in the spirit of the gospel, to give up
   ourselves to obedience to that God and Father who hath appointed so
   precious and lovely means as are the paths of grace for the obtaining
   of so glorious an end as that whereunto we are appointed.

   And thus I doubt not but that it is manifest, by these considerations
   of Mr Goodwin's objections to the contrary, that the doctrine of the
   perseverance of the saints, as by us taught and delivered, doth not
   only fall in a sweet compliance with all the means of grace, especially
   those appointed by God to establish the saints in faith and obedience,
   -- that is, to work perseverance in them, -- but also to be eminently
   useful to give life, vigour, power, and efficacy, in a peculiar gospel
   manner, to all exhortations, threatenings, and promises, appointed and
   applied by God to that end and purpose.

   As to the matter in hand, about the usefulness of the doctrine of the
   perseverance of the saints in and unto the ministry of the gospel, and
   the obstruction pretended to be laid unto it thereby, it may be
   somewhat conducing and of concernment to consider who the persons are
   and were, and what hath been and is the presence of God with them, in
   their ministry, who have been assertors and zealous maintainers of this
   doctrine; and withal who they were, and what they have been in their
   ministry, and in the dispensation of the word committed unto them, who
   have risen up in opposition thereunto. How, also, these different
   parties have approved their profession to the world, and acquitted
   themselves in their generation in their walking with God, may be worth
   our consideration. Doubtless, if the doctrine whose declaration and
   defence we have thus far engaged in be of such a pernicious tendency as
   is pretended, so destructive to gospel obedience, and so evidently
   rendering that great ordinance of the ministry useless, it may be
   traced to its product of these effects, in some measure, in the lives,
   conversations, and ministry, of those who have most zealously espoused
   it, most earnestly contended for it, and been most given up to the form
   and mould thereof. It were a thing every way miraculous, if any root
   should for the most part bring forth fruit disagreeing to the nature of
   it.

   A task this is, I confess, which, were we not necessitated unto, I
   could easily dispense with myself from engaging in; but Mr Goodwin
   having voluntarily entered the list as to this particular, and
   instituted a comparison between the abettors of the several doctrines
   under contest, chap. ix. of his book (a matter we should not have
   expected from any other man), it could not but be thought a gross
   neglect of duty, and high ingratitude towards those great and blessed
   souls who in former and latter days, with indefatigable pains and
   eminent success, watered the vineyard of the Lord with the dew of this
   doctrine, to decline the consideration of the comparison made and
   dressed up to our hand. Now, because it is a peculiar task allotted to
   us, to manifest the embracement of this truth by those who in the
   primitive church were of greatest note and eminency, for piety,
   judgment, and skill in dividing the word aright; with the professed
   opposition made unto it by such as those with whom they lived, and
   succeeding ages, have branded for men unsound in the faith, and leaving
   the good old paths wherein the saints of old found peace to their
   souls; as also to manifest the receiving and propagation of it by all
   (not any one of name excepted) those great and famous persons whom the
   Lord was pleased to employ in the reformation of his church, walking in
   this, as in sundry other particulars, closer up to the truth of the
   gospel than some of their brethren, that at the same time fell off from
   that church which was long before fallen off from the truth; -- I
   shall, in my present inquiry, confine myself to those of our own nation
   who have been of renown in their generation for their labour in the
   Lord, and of name among the saints for their work in the service of the
   gospel.

   For the one half of that small space of time which is passed since the
   breaking forth of the light of the gospel in this nation, we are
   disenabled from pursuing the comparison instituted, the one part being
   not to be considered, or at least not being considerable. The time when
   first head was made against the truth we profess, and criminations like
   those managed by Mr Goodwin hatched and contrived to assault it withal,
   was when it had been eminently delivered to the saints of this nation,
   and to all the churches of Christ, by Reynolds, Whitaker, Greenham, and
   others like to them, their fellow-labourers in the Lord's vineyard. The
   poor weak worms of this present generation who embrace the same
   doctrine with these men of name, are thought to be free (some of them,
   at least) from being destroyed by the poisonous and pernicious
   embracing of it, by their own weakness and disability to discern the
   natural, genuine consequences and tendency in the progress of that
   which in the root and foundation they embrace. Their ignorance of their
   own doctrine in its compass and extent is the mother of that devotion
   which in them is nourished thereby. So our great masters tell us,
   against whose kingly authority in these things there is no rising up.
   For the persons formerly named the like relief cannot be supposed. He
   that shall provide an apology for them, affirming that they understood
   not the state, nature, consequences, and tendencies, of the doctrine
   they received, defended, preached, contended for, will scarce be able,
   by any following defensative, to vindicate his own credit for so doing.
   In the lives, then, and the ministry of those men, and such as those,
   if anywhere, are the fruits of this doctrine to be seen. If it
   corrupted not their lives, nor weakened their ministry; if it turned
   not them aside from the paths of gospel obedience, nor weakened their
   hands in the dispensation of the word, in the promises, threatenings,
   and exhortations thereof, to the conversion of souls and building up of
   those who by their ministry were called, in their most holy faith, --
   it cannot but be a strong presumption that there is no such venomous,
   infectious quality in this doctrine as of late some chemical divines
   pretend themselves to be able to extract out of it. Now, what, I pray,
   were these men? -- what were their lives? what was their ministry? All
   those who now oppose Mr Goodwin's doctrine do it either out of
   ignorance, or to comply with greatness and men in authority; thereby to
   make up themselves in their ambitious and worldly aims, and to prevail
   themselves upon the opinion of men; -- for what cause else in the world
   can be imagined why they should so engage? What though they really
   believe the whole fabric of his doctrine, -- wherein he hath departed
   from the faith he once, as they say, professed, -- to be a lie; a lie
   of dangerous and pernicious consequence to the souls of men; a lie
   derogatory to the glory of God, the efficacy of grace, the merit of the
   death of Christ, and the honour of the gospel, and full of
   disconsolation to poor souls, being in and under temptation? what
   though they suppose it secretly to undermine the main fundamentals of
   the covenant of grace, and covertly to substitute another covenant in
   the room thereof? what though they have observed that the doctrine they
   have received was embraced, preached, prized, by all those great and
   blessed souls which, in the last generation, God magnified with the
   conversion of so many thousands in this nation, given unto their
   ministry, whilst they spent their days under continual afflictions and
   persecutions? what though they have the general, known consent of all
   the reformed churches beyond the seas with them in their zeal for the
   doctrine under consideration? what though, under these and the like
   apprehensions, they profess in the presence of God, his holy angels,
   and men, that the eternal interest of the precious souls of men is more
   valuable to them ten thousand times than their own lives, and that that
   is the sole reason of their opposition to Mr Goodwin in his attempts
   against the doctrine they have so received and embraced? -- yet it is
   meet for us to judge, and for all by whom evil surmises are not
   esteemed to be among the works of the flesh, that all their opposition
   is nothing but a compliance with, and pursuit of, those worldly, low,
   and wretched aims, that they are filled withal! But as to those persons
   before mentioned, what shall we say? Their piety, literature, zeal,
   diligence, industry, labour, with success in the work of the ministry
   (and that under manifold discouragements), are so renowned in the
   world, that how or wherewith they shall be shifted off from being
   considerable in their testimony,! cannot imagine. If ever persons in
   these latter ages had written upon their breasts, "Holiness to the
   Lord," -- if ever any bare about a conformity to the death and
   resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- they may put in for an
   eminent esteem and name among them, and will doubtless be found at last
   to be of the "thirty," if they attain not to the first rank of the
   worthies of Christ in these ends of the world. How is it that they were
   not retarded in the course of their gospel obedience by their
   entertainment of this wretched doctrine of the saints' perseverance?
   But what though they kept themselves personally from the pollution of
   it, yet possibly their ministry was defiled and rendered useless by it!
   And who, I pray, is it that in this generation can so support himself
   with success in the ministry as to rise up with this accusation against
   them? Many thousands who were their crown, their glory, and rejoicing
   in Christ, are fallen asleep; and some continue to this day. Of the
   reasons given by Mr Goodwin why all the zealous, fruitful preachers of
   former days embraced this doctrine, we shall instantly undertake the
   consideration. In the meantime, this seems strange, that God should
   magnify and make famous the ministry of so many throughout the world,
   and give in that visible blessing to their labours therein which hath
   filled this island with such an increase of children to Zion as that
   she hath not lengthened the cords of her tabernacle to such an extent
   and compass in any proportionable spot of earth under heaven, if any
   one eminent part of their doctrine, and that whereon they laid great
   weight in their ministry, which they pressed with as much fervency and
   contention of spirit as any head of the like importance, should indeed
   be so apparently destructive of holiness, and of such a direct and
   irresistible efficiency to render useless that great ordinance of the
   ministry committed to them, as this is clamoured to be. What will be
   the success of them in their ministry who shall undertake to deny and
   oppose it, I hope the people of God in this nation will not have many
   instances to judge by. The best conjecture we can for the present make
   of what will be hereafter must be taken from what hath already come to
   pass; and the best guess of what events will be is to be raised from
   the consideration of what hath been, from a like disposition of causes
   to an answerableness of events.

   What Mr Goodwin hath to plead in this case, he insists on, chap. ix.,
   sect. 24-27, pp. 167-172. The sum and aim of his discourse is, to
   apologize for his doctrine against sundry objections which, in the
   observation of men, it is liable and obnoxious unto. Now, these are
   such as, whatever the issue of their consideration prove, doubtless it
   can be of no advantage unto his cause that his doctrine is so readily
   exposed to them.

   The first of these is, that the doctrine he opposeth, and in opposition
   whereunto that is set up which he so industriously asserts, hath
   generally been received and embraced by men eminent in piety and
   godliness, famous on that account in their generations, with the
   generality of the people of God with them. And this is attended with
   that which naturally ensues thereon, -- namely, the scandalousness of
   the most of them (yea, of them all of this nation is it spoken) who
   have formerly asserted the doctrine which Mr Goodwin hath lately
   espoused. Whereunto, in the third place, an observation is subjoined of
   the "ordinary defection of men to loose and unsavoury practices, after
   they have once drunk in the principles of that opinion which he now so
   industriously mixeth and tempereth for them." It is usually said,
   "There is no smoke but where there is some fire." It would be strange
   if such observations as these should be readily and generally made by
   men concerning the doctrine under contest, unless there were some
   evident occasion administered by it thereunto; and I must needs say,
   that if they prove true, and hold under examination, they will become
   as urging a prejudice as can lightly be laid against any cause in
   religion whatsoever. The gospel being a "doctrine according to
   godliness," several persuasions pretending to be parts and portions
   thereof, if one shall be found to be the constant faith and profession
   of those who also have the life and power of godliness in them, the
   other to be maintained by "evil men and seducers," who upon their
   receiving it do also "wax worse and worse," it is no small advantage to
   the first, in its plea for admittance to the right and title of a truth
   of the gospel.

   First, To evade this charge, Mr Goodwin premises this in general:--

   "The experience asserted in the objection is not so unquestionable in
   point of truth but that, if the assertors were put home upon the proof,
   they would, I fear" (doubtless he rather hopes it), "account more in
   presumption than in reasonableness of argument; for if persons of the
   one judgment and of the other were duly compared together, I verily
   believe there would be found every whit as full a proportion of men
   truly conscientious and religious amongst those whose judgments stand,
   and have stood, for a possibility of falling away, as on the other
   side: but, through a foolish and unsavoury kind of partiality, we are
   apt, on all hands, according to the proverb, to account our own geese
   for swans, and other men's swans geese.' Certain I am, that if the
   writings of men of the one judgment and of the other be compared
   together, and an estimate made from thence of the religion, worth, and
   holiness, of the authors respectively, those who oppose the common
   doctrine of perseverance do account it no robbery to make themselves
   every way equal in this honour with their opposers. The truth is (if it
   be lawful for me to utter what I really apprehend and judge in the
   case), I do not find that spirit of holiness to breathe, with that
   authority, heat, or excellency of power, in the writings of the latter,
   which I am very sensible of in the writings of the former. These call
   for righteousness, holiness, and all manner of Christian conversation,
   with every whit as high a hand as the other, and add nothing to check,
   obstruct, or enfeeble, the authority of their demands in this kind;
   whereas the other, though they be sore many times in their exhortations
   and conjurements unto holiness, yet other while render both these and
   themselves in them contemptible, by avouching such principles which cut
   the very sinews and strength of such their exhortations, and fully
   balance all the weight of those motives by which they seek to bind them
   upon the consciences of men. And as for men truly holy and
   conscientious, doubtless the primitive Christians, for three hundred
   years together and upwards, next after the times of the apostles, will
   fully balance, with an abundant surplusage, both for numbers and truth
   of godliness, all those in the reformed churches who since Calvin's
   days have adhered to the common doctrine of perseverance. And that the
   churches of Christ very generally, during the said space of three
   hundred years and more, held a possibility of a total and final
   defection, even in true and sound believers, is so clear from the
   records yet extant of those times that it cannot be denied."

   Ans. To let pass Mr Goodwin's proverb with its application (it being
   very facile to return it to its author, there being nothing in the
   world by him proposed to induce us to such an estimation of his
   associates in the work of teaching the doctrine of the saints' apostasy
   and their labours therein, or any other undertaking of theirs, as he
   labours to beget in gilding over their worth and writings, but only his
   own judgment, and an overweening of their geese for swans), let us see
   what is offered by him to evince the experience asserted not to be so
   unquestionable as is pretended. He offers, 1. His own affirmation,
   "That if an estimate may be made of men's worth and holiness by their
   writings, those who oppose the doctrine of the saints' perseverance
   will be found, in the promotion of holiness and practice of it, to
   outgo their adversaries." Their writings," he tells us, "breathe forth
   a spirit of holiness such as he cannot find in the writings of others."
   But, first, for this you have only Mr Goodwin's naked, single
   testimony, and that opposed to the common experience of the people of
   God. What weight this is like to bear with men the event will show. It
   is a hard thing for one man, upon his bare word, to undertake to
   persuade a multitude that what their eyes see and their ears hear is
   not so. Mr Goodwin had need have Pythagorean disciples for the
   embracing of these dictates of his. The experience of thousands is
   placed to confirm the observation insisted on. Saith Mr Goodwin, "It is
   not so; they are, in my judgment, all deceived." But, secondly, who are
   they in whose writings Mr Goodwin hath found such a "spirit of holiness
   breathing, with authority, as is not to be found out nor perceived in
   the writings of them that assert the doctrine of the perseverance of
   the saints?" Calvin, Zanchius, Beza, etc., and (to confine ourselves to
   home) Reynolds, Whitaker, Perkins, Greenham, Dodd, Preston, Bolton,
   Sibbs, Rogers, Culverwell, Cotton, etc., -- whose fame upon this very
   account, of the eminent and effectual breathing of a spirit of holiness
   in their writings, is gone out into all the nations about us, and their
   remembrance is blessed at home and abroad, -- are some of the men who
   have, as hath been showed, laboured in watering the vineyard of the
   Lord with the dew and rain of this doctrine. Who or where are they who
   have excelled them in this undertaking? Let the men be named, and the
   writings produced, that Mr Goodwin may have some joined with him in a
   search after and judgment of that spirit that breathes so excellently
   in them, that we be not forced to take his testimony of we know not
   what nor whom. Those amongst ourselves of chiefest name who have
   appeared in the cause that Mr Goodwin hath now undertaken are, Tompson,
   Montague, etc., with an obscure rabble of that generation. I shall
   easily allow Mr Goodwin to be a man more sharp-sighted than the most of
   those with whom he hath to do in this present contest, as also to have
   his senses more exercised in the writings of those eminent persons last
   named; but yet that he is sensible of such a spirit of holiness
   breathing in their writings (which, for the most part, are stuffed with
   cruel scoffings at the professors of it, and horrible contempt of all
   close walking with God), I cannot easily and readily believe. Should he
   add to them Arminius, with all that followed him in the Low Countries;
   their most learned Corvinus, drunk and sober; as also such among the
   Papists and Lutherans as are his companions in this work; and swell
   them all with the rhetoric of his commendations until they break, -- I
   dare say he will never be able, before indifferent judges, to make out
   his assertion of the excellency of their writings for the furtherance
   of holiness, compared with the labours of those great and holy souls
   who have, both among ourselves and abroad, laboured in the work I am at
   present engaged in. The world of men professing the reformed religion
   have long since, in their judgments, determined this difference, nor
   doth it deserve any farther debate.

   2. "That those who maintain the perseverance of the saints are sore,
   indeed, in their exhortations to holiness, but contemptible in their
   principles, upon which they should build those exhortations," is an
   insinuation that Mr Goodwin sometimes makes use of, handsomely to beg
   the thing in question, when he despairs to carry it by any convincing
   argument in a fair dispute. That the principles of this doctrine are
   eminently serviceable to the furtherance and promotion of holiness hath
   been formerly evinced beyond all possibility of contradiction from them
   who in any measure understand what true godliness is and wherein it
   doth consist. Neither ought Mr Goodwin, if he would be esteemed as a
   man disputing for his persuasion, so often to beg the thing in
   question, knowing full well that he hath not so deserved of them with
   whom he hath to do as to obtain any thing of this nature, on those
   terms, at their hands.

   3. What was the judgment of the primitive Christians, as in others, so
   in and about this head of Christian religion, is best known from that
   rule of doctrine which it is confessed they attended unto, being
   delivered unto them, and in the defence whereof, and to give testimony
   whereto, so many thousands of them "loved not their lives unto the
   death." Of those that committed over to posterity any thing of their
   thoughts in that space of time limited by Mr Goodwin (namely, three
   hundred years), he names but two; of whom I shall only say, that if
   they failed in their apprehensions of the truth in this matter, it is
   not the only thing wherein they so failed. And yet that it can be
   [made] evident in the least that they were consenting in judgment with
   Mr Goodwin wherein from us he differs is absolutely denied. This
   elsewhere is already farther considered. It is a common observation,
   and not destitute of a great evidence of truth, that the liberty of
   expression which is used by men in the delivery of any doctrine,
   especially if it be done obiter, by the way, before some opposition
   hath been framed and stated thereunto, hath given advantage to those
   following of them (when death hath prevented all possibility for them
   to explain themselves and their own thoughts) to draw them into a
   participation with them in that which their souls abhorred. The plea of
   Arius and his associates concerning the judgment of the doctors of the
   church in the days before him about the great article of our faith, the
   deity of Christ, is known. That there are in many of the ancients
   sundry expressions seemingly varying from that doctrine we assert, upon
   the account of their different apprehensions of the terms of "faith,"
   being "regenerated," "holiness," and the like (which are all of them
   still with us, as in the Scripture, of various significations, and not
   dearly expressive of any one sense intended by them, until
   distinguished), is not denied. Speaking of all those who had been
   baptized and made profession of their faith as "believers," it is no
   wonder if they granted that some believers might fall away; but yet, in
   the meantime, the most eminent of them constantly affirmed that there
   is a sort of believers who, upon the matter with them, were the only
   true and real believers (being such as we formerly described) that
   could not fall either totally or finally. But as for this, I hope full
   satisfaction is tendered the learned reader in the preface of this
   discourse. So that, these exceptions notwithstanding, the prejudices
   that Mr Goodwin's doctrine labours under, from the opposition made to
   it and against it, in the defence of that which it riseth up to
   overthrow, by that generation of the saints of God, lies upon the
   shoulders thereof as a burden too heavy for it to bear.

   Secondly, Mr Goodwin farther proceeds, sect. 25, to inform us of some
   other mistakes in the instance given to make good the former
   observation; for as for Calvin, Musculus, Martyr, Bucer, with the
   ministers of this nation who in the last generation so zealously
   opposed the persecutions and innovations of some returning with speed
   and violence to Rome, he tells us "they were very far from having their
   judgments settled as to the doctrine under contest, so as resolvedly to
   have embraced the one and rejected the other."

   I should willingly walk in the high way for the manifestation and clear
   eviction of the untruth of this suggestion, -- namely, by producing
   their testimonies in abundant, plentiful manner, to confirm their
   clearness and resolution in the truth we profess, with their zealous
   endeavours for the establishment, confirmation, and propagation of it,
   -- but that some few considerations delivered me from engaging in so
   facile a task; for, --

   1. I am not able to persuade myself that any man who ever read the
   writings of the first sort of men mentioned, and knows the constant
   doctrine to this day of the churches which they planted and watered, or
   ever did hear of the latter, will entertain this assertion of Mr
   Goodwin's with any thing but admiration upon what grounds he should
   make it. And, --

   2. Himself discovering in part on what account he doth namely, because
   of their exhortations to watchfulness, carefulness, and close walking
   with God, with their denunciations of threatenings to them that abide
   not in the faith, which he fancies to be inconsistent with the doctrine
   of perseverance, as by him opposed (which inconsistency we have long
   since fully manifested to be the issue and offspring of his own
   imagination, begotten of it by the cunning sophistry of his Pelagian
   friends), -- I know not why I should farther insist upon the wiping
   away of this reproach cast upon those blessed souls whom God so
   magnified in the work of the gospel of his Son in their generation. I
   remember Navaret, a Dominican friar, upon his observation of the
   subtilties of the Jesuits to wrest many sayings of the ancients in
   favour of their opinions in those doctrines wherein those two orders
   are at variance, affirms, "That he was afraid that when he was dead,
   although he had written and disputed so much against them, they would
   produce him for a testimony and witness on their side." What he feared
   concerning himself, Mr Goodwin hath attempted concerning many more
   worthy persons. Cutting off sentences from what goes before and follows
   after, restraining general expressions, imposing his own hypothesis on
   his reader in making application of what he quotes out of any author,
   he hath spent one whole chapter to persuade the world that men of as
   great abilities and judgments as any in the world since the apostles
   fell asleep have usually expressed themselves in a direct contradiction
   to what they are eminently and notoriously known, as their professed,
   deliberate judgments, to have maintained!

   Thirdly, He farther informs us how this doctrine of the perseverance of
   the saints came to be so generally entertained by the godly, zealous,
   and able ministers of this nation, that when we see how they fell into
   it, their testimony given thereto may be of less validity with us.

   "This," he telleth you, "was the permission of Mr Perkins' judgment to
   be overruled by the texts of Scripture commonly insisted on for the
   proof of this doctrine. The great worth of the person commended,
   therefore, the worth of the opinion; and he verily believeth, as men
   were then induced to receive this opinion, so to a relinquishment of it
   they want nothing but the countenance and authority of some person of
   popular acceptance to go before them. And the reason he giveth of this
   his faith is the observation of the principles they usually hold forth,
   especially in the applicatory part of their sermons."

   Ans. What and who they were who are thus represented by Mr Goodwin, in
   their receiving and embracing of that doctrine which, with the great
   travail of their souls, all their days they preached, and pressed to
   and upon others, is known to all. The persons I named before, one of
   them only excepted, with all those eminent burning and shining lights
   which for so many years have laboured with renown and success, to the
   astonishment of the world, in the preaching of the gospel in this
   nation, are the men intended. Doubtless such thoughts have not in
   former days been entertained of them, however the contemplation of any
   man's own ability may now raise him to contempt of them. Mr Perkins
   received this doctrine, and therefore all the godly ministers of this
   nation did so too! If any one of the like esteem with him did fall off
   from it (now whom they should obtain to lead them, of equal reputation
   and acceptance with him who hath in vain attempted it, I know not),
   they would quickly follow, not like shepherds but sheep, into an
   opposition thereunto! Those who have not very slight thoughts of them,
   -- which doubtless they that are fallen asleep did not deserve, -- will
   scarcely suppose that they entertained a truth of so great importance
   as this upon so easy terms as these insinuated, or that they would have
   parted with it at so cheap a rate.

   Farther; why the ministers of England should be thought to entertain
   this doctrine merely upon the authority and countenance of Mr Perkins
   given thereunto, when the universality of the teachers of all other
   reformed churches, of the same confession in other things with them,
   did also embrace the same doctrine, and do continue in profession of it
   to this day, what reason can be assigned? Had there been a particular
   inducement to the ministers of England for the receiving of it, which
   was altogether foreign unto them who as to our nation are foreigners,
   whence is it that there should be such a coincidence of their judgments
   with them therein? or why may not ours be thought to take it upon the
   same account with them, upon whose judgments and understandings the
   authority of Mr Perkins cannot be supposed to have had any influence?
   Is Mr Goodwin the only person who in this nation hath impartially
   weighed all things of concernment to the refusing or embracing any
   matters or doctrines in religion? Have no others, in the sincerity of
   their hearts, searched the Scriptures, and earnestly begged the
   guidance of the Spirit, according to that encouraging promise left by
   their Master that they should receive him so doing? The good Lord take
   away from us all high thoughts of ourselves, and all contempt of them
   that profess the fear of the Lord, with whom we have to do! For the
   reason of Mr Goodwin's faith in this thing, concerning the readiness of
   the godly ministers of this nation to apostatize from the doctrine of
   the saints' perseverance, -- namely, their manifesting themselves to be
   possessed of many principles of a contrary tendency unto it in the
   applicatory part of their sermons, -- the vanity of is hath been long
   since discovered, so that there is no farther need to lay open the
   unreasonableness thereof.

   Mr Goodwin, mistrusting his ability to persuade men that the persons of
   whom he hath discoursed were not clear in their judgments as to an
   opposition to that doctrine which he positively owneth and zealously
   contendeth for, and knowing that it cannot be denied but that they were
   men of eminency for godliness and close walking in communion with God
   all their days, yet excepteth, as his last refuge, "That it cannot be
   manifested that this opinion had the least influence in their pious
   conversation, which is wholly to be ascribed to other commendable
   principles that they embraced." This, indeed, may be said of any part
   of the doctrine whatsoever that they received, and some of them
   suffered for. Atheists may say it of the whole profession of
   Christianity, and ascribe the goodness of the lives of the best of them
   that profess it to some other principles common to them with the
   residue of mankind, and not at all to any of those whereby they are
   distinguished as such. This they professed to have a powerful efficacy
   to prevail with them for that exactness in walking with God which, by
   his grace, they attained unto; and why they should not be believed
   herein, as far as any men whatever, bearing the like testimony to any
   doctrine whatever, I know not. Besides, the intendment of this instance
   of the persons and their piety who formerly believed and spake forth
   this doctrine was, to manifest, by an eminent experiment, that there
   was not in it, nor is, any tendency to a contrary frame unto piety and
   holiness, which it is injuriously charged withal; and if by the
   consideration thereof we do not obtain that it hath a proper and direct
   serviceableness to the promotion of godliness, yet at least we have a
   convincing demonstration that it is no way obstructive to it.

   Nextly, sect. 26, Mr Goodwin entereth upon his defensative to the
   charge against his doctrine whose foundation is laid in the
   unworthiness of its authors in this nation, before it fell upon his
   hand. These he confesseth to be the worst of our late bishops, with
   such as Romanized and tyrannized among them, with their clergy
   creatures and favourites, persons many of them of superstition,
   looseness, and much profaneness. Of the apology shaped for the clearing
   of the doctrine he maintaineth from a participation with them in their
   unworthiness, there are three parts; in the first whereof he denieth
   that "this doctrine did any way induce them to the looseness that was
   found upon them," in the other two he giveth as many reasons of their
   receiving of it and cleaving to it.

   As for the first part, I shall willingly assent to him that the
   holiness or unholiness of professors is not to be charged on the
   religion they profess (I mean appearing holiness, in the profession of
   it), unless there be an evidence of a connection betwixt their
   principles and practices; which in this case, to us and our
   apprehension of them who charge this doctrine with the miscarriages of
   those men, there is; at least, we may insist on this, that there is a
   suitableness in the whole system of the doctrine, whereof the apostasy
   of the saints is an eminent parcel, to that frame of spirit which is in
   men of loose and superstitious ways, enemies of the grace of God and
   power of godliness. Neither can there any other reason be tolerably
   assigned or alleged for the embracement of that doctrine by those
   persons formerly mentioned, but only their ignorance of and enmity to
   the great mysteries of the gospel, the covenant of grace, with union,
   communion, and close walking with God. A design was upon them, written
   with the beams of the sun, to cry up a barren, outside, light, and
   loose profession, with a vain, superstitious, self-invented worship of
   God, instead of the power of a gospel conversation and ordinances of
   Christ according to his appointment. Seeking after a "righteousness, as
   it were, by the works of the law," and being ignorant of the
   righteousness of Christ, they found the whole doctrine whose defence Mr
   Goodwin hath lately undertaken suited to their principles and aims; and
   therefore with greediness drank it down like water, until they were
   swelled with the dropsy of pride and self-conceit beyond what they
   could bear. Whatever be now pretended, it was little disputed then, and
   in those days which Mr Goodwin pointeth unto, but that looseness of
   life, inclination to Popery, and enmity to the power of godliness, were
   at the bottom of the entertainment of the Arminian principles by that
   generation of men.

   But Mr Goodwin proceedeth to alleviate this charge, and informs us
   thus: "That if the soundness and rottenness of opinions should be
   esteemed by the goodness or badness of the lives of any parcel or
   number of persons professing the same, as well the opinion of atheism,
   which denieth the being of any god, as the opinion of polytheism, which
   affirmeth the plurality of gods, must be esteemed better and more sound
   than that which maintaineth the being of one God, and of one only; for
   certain it is that there have been many heathens professors, some of
   the one and some of the other of these opinions, who have quitted
   themselves upon fairer terms of honour and approbation in their lives
   than many Christians professing the last opinion have done."

   I am not willing to wring this nose too far, lest blood should follow.
   The lives of many atheists and pagans are preferred before the lives of
   many professing Christianity. By "professors of Christianity" Mr
   Goodwin intendeth those who are so indeed, and seasoned with the power
   of the principles of that religion, or such only as, making an outward
   profession of it, are indeed acted with principles quite of another
   nature, which, notwithstanding all their profession, rendereth them, in
   the truth of the thing itself, "enemies of the cross of Christ, whose
   end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in
   their shame," Phil. iii. 18, 19. If the former be intended, as the
   assertion is most false, the gospel only effectually "teaching men to
   deny all ungodliness, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in
   this present world," so it tendeth directly to the highest derogation
   from the honour of our Lord Jesus Christ and of his glorious gospel He
   that would be thoroughly acquainted with the notorious untruth of this
   insinuation, let him a little consult Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius,
   Austin, and others, handling the lives and conversations of the best of
   the polytheists and heathens before and in their days; if he be not
   contented to take a shorter course, and rest in the authority of the
   apostle, or rather of the Holy Ghost, describing them and their
   conversation to the life, as they lay under the just hardening
   judgments of God, Rom. i. 18, to the end. If the latter sort of men,
   called Christians, be intended, the comparison instituted between them
   and atheists is to no purpose, they themselves being disclaimed and
   disowned by Christ and his gospel, and reckoned among them with whom
   they are compared: so that, upon the matter, this is but the comparing
   one sort of atheists with another, and giving in a judgment, that of
   all, those are worst whose practices are so, and who yet pacify their
   own consciences and deceive the world with a pretence and flourish of a
   glorious profession.

   I shall not now enter upon any long inquiry what influence the ungodly
   and profane lives of any ought to have upon the judgment of men in
   discovering and discerning of the doctrines that they bring, especially
   if such as consent in any doctrine do also concur in a dissoluteness of
   conversation. That it will be of no small consideration, the experience
   of all ages hath evinced. The Athenians refused a virtuous law, because
   the person was vicious who proposed it; and it is generally esteemed
   that there is a correspondency betwixt the principles and practices of
   those men who earnestly profess the promotion of those principles, so
   that they are mutual producers and advantagers one of another. This is
   all at present that was aimed at in the charge upon Mr Goodwin's
   doctrine, which he undertakes to waive: It was generally embraced, at
   its first broaching in our world, only by men of a loose and scandalous
   conversation, superstitious in their ways of worship, and enemies of
   the power of godliness; which being confessed, for the argument from
   thence, "valeat quantum valere potest."

   But Mr Goodwin giveth us two reasons why this doctrine of his was so
   gladly received and zealously asserted by that generation of men. The
   first, which, he telleth you, is plain and easy to be given in, is
   this: "Being professed enemies to the most religious and zealous
   preachers and ministers of the land, with their adherents, whom they
   termed Puritans,' whom they both hated and feared, as a generation of
   men by whom, rather than any other, they apprehended themselves in
   danger of being dethroned, Nec eos fefellit opinio.' Upon this ground
   they judged it a very material point of their interest to oppose and
   keep under this faction,' as they termed them. In order thereunto, they
   studied and cast about how to weaken their interest and repute with the
   generality of the people, or at least with all those that were
   intelligent, and in that respect considerable; to this end wisely
   considering that nothing was like to prejudice them more in their
   esteem with most men than to detect them of error and unsoundness in
   their doctrine; and perceiving withal (as with half an eye they might,
   being so fully disengaged as they were from all high thoughts of those
   that held them) that they were not in any doctrine besides, which they
   were generally known to hold and teach, more obnoxious to such a
   detection than in those which they held and taught in opposition to the
   Remonstrants, hereupon they politically fell to profess and teach
   Remonstrantism, that so they might have the more frequent occasion and
   opportunity to lay open the puritan doctrine before the people, and to
   show the inconsistency of it with the Scriptures, as also with many of
   the most manifest principles as well of reason as religion besides."

   Ans. That this is a most vain and groundless conjecture, I presume any
   one that will but cast back his thoughts upon the posture of affairs
   during the reign of that generation of men, and a little consider the
   ways and means whereby they were, through the righteous hand of God,
   reduced to that condition and state wherein they now are, will quickly
   determine. The truth is, they were so far from advantaging themselves
   against their adversaries, and prevailing upon them, in the esteem of
   the most rational and knowing men in the nation, by their entertaining
   the Arminian doctrine, that utterly, on the other side, they
   dishonoured their cause of ceremonies, discipline, and conformity,
   which with success they had so long carried on with the generality of
   the nation, and exposed themselves to the power of the people of the
   land in parliament, from whence, as to all other differences, they were
   sheltered by an appearance of legal constitutions; so that, after some
   forward person of that faction (the most contemptible, indeed, as to
   any real worth, one or two individuals only excepted, of the whole
   tribe) had, upon the grounds forementioned, taken up and made
   profession of the opinions and doctrine we are speaking of, they fell
   daily before their adversaries as to the esteem of all, or at least the
   greatest part, of those who cordially and thoroughly adhered to them as
   to the discipline and worship then established. Certainly the
   prelatical party themselves will not say they prevailed on that hand,
   as to any ends and purposes for the establishment of their interest, or
   making good their ground against their opposers. Nay, the most sober
   and learned of that sort of men do to this day ascribe, in no small
   measure, the downfall of the whole fabric whereof they were parts and
   members to the precipitating rashness and folly of some few in
   advancing and pressing the Arminian errors that they themselves were
   given up unto. As for the zealous and godly ministers of the nation,
   usually termed "Puritans" (who are here acknowledged by Mr Goodwin to
   have all generally opposed the doctrine he striveth to build up),
   though they had in many parliaments, wherein the most intelligent and
   rational men of the nation are usually convened, made by their friends
   sundry attempts for their relief against the persecutions of the
   others, -- as is evidenced by their petitions and addresses still on
   record, -- yet they were never able to obtain the least redress of
   their grievances, nor to get one step of ground against their
   adversaries, until the advantage of their Arminianism was administered
   unto them; on which, by several degrees, they prevailed themselves in
   the issue to the utter breaking of the yoke of their taskmasters. It is
   true, He who "taketh the crafty in their own imaginations, and mixeth
   the counsel of the wise with madness and folly, causing them to err in
   their ways as a drunken man in his vomit," doth oftentimes turn the
   devices of men upon their own heads, and make those things subservient
   to their ruin which they fixed upon as the most expedient mediums for
   their establishment and continuance, -- such perhaps was the case with
   them in their canonical oath, attempted to be imposed in one of their
   last convocations, -- but that the taking up and asserting of the
   Arminian doctrine was a design of that party of men to get upon the
   judgments and affections of the people, and to expose the puritanical
   preachers to their contempt and reproach, is an imagination that cannot
   lightly fall upon any one who had his eyes open in the days wherein
   those things were publicly acted on the stage of this nation. For that
   insinuation in the close of Mr Goodwin's discourse, concerning the
   advantages given that sort of men by the inconsistency of the doctrine
   of the Puritans, which they opposed, with the principles of religion
   and reason, I shall only say, that it being once more, through the
   providence of God, called forth to a public debate, it neither standeth
   nor falleth to the judgment of any single man, much less of one who is
   professedly engaged in an opposition thereunto.

   Another reason, of the same evidence with the former, is tendered in
   these words: "It is generally known that the cathedral generation of
   men throughout Christendom were generally great admirers of the old
   learning (as some call it), I mean the writings and tenets of the
   fathers, and of Austin more especially, and that they frequently made
   shield and buckler of their authority to defend themselves against the
   pens and opinions of later writers, whom their manner was, according to
   the exigency of their interest (at least as they conceived), to slight
   and vilify in comparison of the others. Now, the judgment of the
   fathers more generally, and of Austin more particularly, stood for the
   possibility of the saints' defection, both total and final, wherein it
   seemeth the greater part of our modern reformed divines have departed
   from them."

   That this pretence is no whit better than that before will be evidenced
   by the light of this one consideration, namely, that those among the
   bishops and their adherents who were indeed most zealous of, and best
   versed in, the writings of the fathers, were generally of the same
   judgment about the grace of Christ and the will of man, etc., with the
   residue of the reformed churches and the puritan preachers of our own
   nation. They were a company of sciolists in comparison, and men of
   nothing, who arminianized; men, as the bishop of Lincoln once told
   them, whose "learning lay in a few unlearned liturgies." It is true,
   they had gotten to such a head and to such a height, not long before
   their fall, that they were ready to accuse and charge their associates
   as to discipline, worship, and ceremony of Puritanism; who failed not
   to retort Arminianism and Popery back again to them. We know who said
   of the others that they were "tantum non in episcopatu Puritani;" and
   who returned to him and his associates, "Tantum non uxoratu
   Pontificii." The truth is, those among them, as there were many among
   them, both bishops and men (as they speak and think) of inferior
   orders, who were solidly learned, especially in the writings of the
   ancients (of whom many are yet alive, but some are fallen asleep), were
   universally, almost to a man, of the same judgment with Calvin in the
   heads of our religion under consideration. Jewell, Abbot, Morton,
   Usher, Hall, Davenant, and Prideaux (great names among the world of
   learned men), with a considerable retinue of men of repute for
   literature and devotion (with whom on no account whatever the
   arminianizing party of the prelates and their followers are to be named
   the same day), have sufficiently testified their thoughts in this
   matter to all the world. From what ambiguity of expression it is that
   any sentence is stolen from Austin and others of the ancients, seeming
   to countenance the doctrine of the saints' apostasy, hath been
   elsewhere discovered, and may farther be manifested as occasion shall
   be administered. And without pretence to any great skill in the old
   learning, this I dare assert (whereof I have given some account in the
   preface to the reader), that not one of the ancients, much less Austin,
   did ever maintain such an apostasy of saints and such a perseverance as
   that which Mr Goodwin contendeth for.

   This being that which Mr Goodwin hath to offer for the clearing of the
   doctrine he maintaineth from the first two parts of the charge
   exhibited against it, he applieth himself, in the last place, to
   contend with a common observation made by Christians weighing and
   pondering the principles and ways of men in the days wherein we live,
   namely, "The degeneracy of the most of men who at any time embrace it
   from their former profession, and their turning aside to the paths of
   looseness and folly;" -- an observation which, if true (though Mr
   Goodwin is pleased to assert that any considering man, like himself,
   will laugh it to scorn), will not easily be digested in the thoughts of
   them that are willing to weigh aright the usual presence of God with
   his truths, especially at the first embracement and entertainment of
   them. Neither will this observation be diverted from pursuing the
   doctrine against which it is lifted up, by comparing it with that of
   "the unhappiness of marriages made between cousins-german," there being
   nothing in that relation that should be a disposing cause to any such
   issue as is pretended; much less with that farther observation, that
   some "apostatize from the protestant religion, yea, from Christianity
   itself;" there being not the least parity, or indeed analogy, in the
   instances. If it might be affirmed of men, that after their embracing
   of Christianity or the protestant religion, they generally decline and
   grow worse, as to their moral conversation, than they were before, I do
   not know at present what apology could be readily fixed on that might
   free the one and the other from grievous scandal. To fall from a
   profession of any religion, or any head or part of a religion, upon the
   account of the corruption that is in them that so fall from it, is
   rather an honour than a reproach to the religion so deserted. But, in
   and upon the embracement of any religion or doctrine in religion, for
   men to decline from that which is the proper end of all true religion
   (which is the observation that riseth up against the doctrine Mr
   Goodwin asserteth, in reference to very many that embrace it),
   doubtless is not the crown and glory of that which they profess.
   Neither is this observation built on so slight experience as to be
   muzzled with proverbs of swallows and woodcocks, the streets of our
   cities and paths of our villages being full of those fowls, or rather
   foul spirits, that give strength unto it.

   This is the whole of what Mr Goodwin thought good to tender for the
   protection of his doctrine from the charge laid down at the entrance of
   this digression; on the consideration whereof, I doubt not but it is
   evident how unable he is to shield it from the wound intended unto it
   thereby. And shall we now, can we, entertain any other thoughts of it
   but that (having constantly hitherto been denied and opposed by the
   most zealous, painful, godly, successful preachers of the gospel that
   these latter ages have been, through the goodness of God, blessed
   withal, entertained chiefly by men of loose, dissolute principles and
   practices, enemies to the power of godliness and the profession
   thereof, and strongly suspected to corrupt the minds and conversations
   of men that do embrace it) it is the only serviceable relief and
   assistance for the making of the ministry of the gospel useful and
   fruitful, ingenerating holiness and obedience in the lives and ways of
   men?
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter XIV. Argument against the doctrine from the exhortations of the gospel.

   Mr G.'s third argument proposed and considered -- The drama borrowed by
   Mr G. to make good this argument -- The frame of speech ascribed to God
   by the Remonstrants, according to our doctrine, weighed and considered
   -- The dealing of God with man, and the importance of his exhortations,
   according to the doctrine of the saints' perseverance, manifested -- In
   what sense and to what end exhortations and threatenings are made to
   believers -- The fallacious ground of this argument of Mr G. -- Mr G.'s
   fourth argument proposed to consideration, considered -- Eternal life,
   how and in what sense a reward of perseverance -- The enforcement of
   the major proposition considered -- The proposition new moulded, to
   make it of concernment to our doctrine, and denied, from the example of
   the obedience of Jesus Christ -- Efficacy of grace not inconsistent
   with reward -- The argument enforced with a new consideration-That
   consideration examined and removed -- Farther of the consistency of
   effectual grace and gospel exhortations.

   A third argument is proposed, sect. 18, chap. xiii., in these words:
   "That doctrine which representeth God as weak, incongruous, and
   incoherent with himself, in his applications unto men, is not from God,
   and consequently that which contradicteth it must needs be the truth;
   but the doctrine of perseverance, opposed by us, putteth this great
   dishonour upon God, representeth him weak, incongruous, etc.: ergo."
   For the proof of the minor proposition, to make good the charge in it
   exhibited against the doctrine of perseverance, there is a dramatical
   scheme induced (to whose framing and application Mr Goodwin contributed
   no more but the pains of a translator, taking it from the Anti-synod.,
   pp. 276, 277), in these words: "?You that truly believe in my Son, and
   have been once made partakers of my Holy Spirit, and therefore are
   fully persuaded and assured, from my will and command given unto you in
   that behalf, yea, according to the infallible word of truth which you
   have from me, that you cannot possibly, no, not by all the most horrid
   sins and abominable practices that you shall or can commit, fall away
   either totally or finally from your faith, -- for in the midst of your
   foulest actions and courses there remains a seed in you which is
   sufficient to make you true believers, and to preserve you from falling
   away finally, so that it is impossible you should die in your sins; you
   that know and are assured that I will, by an irresistible hand, work
   perseverance in you, and consequently that you are out of all danger of
   condemnation, and that heaven and salvation belong unto you, and are as
   good as yours already, so that nothing but giving of thanks appertains
   to you, which also you know that I will, do what you will in the
   meantime, necessitate you unto; -- you, I say, that are fully and
   thoroughly persuaded and possessed with the truth of all these things,
   I earnestly charge, admonish, exhort, and beseech, that you take heed
   to yourselves that ye continue in the faith, that there be not at any
   time an evil heart of unbelief in any to depart from the living God,
   that you fall not from your own steadfastness. Yea, I declare and
   profess unto you, that if you shall draw back, my soul shall have no
   pleasure in you; that if you shall deny me, I will deny you; that if
   you be again overcome of the lusts of the world, and be entangled
   therewith, your latter end shall be worse than your beginning; that if
   you shall turn away, all your former righteousness shall not be
   remembered, but you shall die in your sins, and suffer the vengeance of
   eternal fire. On the other hand, if you shall continue to the end, my
   promise is that you shall be saved. Therefore, strive to enter in at
   the strait gate, quit yourselves like men, labour for the meat that
   endureth unto everlasting life, and be not slothful, but followers of
   them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.' He that
   shall duly weigh and consider what a senseless and indeed ridiculous
   incongruity there is between these exhortations, adjurations,
   threatenings, and latter promises, and those declarations,
   applications, and former promises, doubtless will confess that either
   the one or the other of them are not from God or according to the mind
   of God."

   Ans. The incongruity of this fiction with the doctrine it is framed
   against is so easily manifested, that it will not much concern us to
   consider the incongruity that the several parts of it have one with
   another; for, --

   First, The whole foundation of this fanatic fabric is ridiculous in
   itself, and ridiculously imposed on the doctrine of perseverance: for
   whereas it says not that all saints have any comfortable assurance of
   their perseverance, and so may, by all gospel ways whatever, by
   promises and threatenings, be stirred up to the use of those means
   whereby perseverance is wrought and assurance obtained; so it says that
   no one saint in the world ever had, can have, or was taught to expect
   his perseverance, or the least sense or assurance of it, under such an
   uncouth supposition as falling into and continuing in sins and
   abominations. The promises they have to assure them of their
   inseparable abode with God to the end are, "that he will write his law
   in their hearts, and put his fear in their inward parts, that they
   shall never depart from him;" and that they shall be kept up thereto by
   the use of means suitable, as appointed of God for the attaining of the
   end proposed, being" kept by the power of God," but "through faith,
   unto salvation." God doth not call (nor cloth the doctrine of the
   perseverance of the saints, or of the stability and unchangeableness of
   his promises in Christ to believers, assert it) any to believe that
   they shall never fall away from him, what sins and rebellions soever
   they fall into; neither hath he promised any such thing unto them, but
   only that he will, through his grace, preserve them in the use of means
   from such rebellions as are inconsistent with his love and free
   acceptation through Christ, according to the tenor of the covenant of
   grace. So that instead of the first part of this fiction, whose
   inconsistency with the latter is after argued, let this, according to
   the analogy of our doctrine, be substituted:--

   "You that truly believe in my Son Jesus Christ, and are made partakers
   of my Holy Spirit, who being heirs of the promises, and so have a right
   to that abundant consolation, that joy in believing, which I am willing
   all of you should receive, I know your fears, doubts, perplexities, and
   temptations, your failings, sins, and backslidings, and what sad
   thoughts, on the account of the evil of your own hearts and ways, you
   are exposed to, -- as, that you shall never abide nor be able to
   continue with me and in my love to the end. Let the feeble knees be
   strengthened, and the hands that hang down be lifted up. Behold, I have
   ordained good works for you to walk in, as the way wherein you are to
   walk for the attainment of the end of your faith, the salvation of your
   souls. And to quicken you and stir you up hereunto, I have provided and
   established effectual ordinances, revealed in the word of my grace;
   whereunto you are to attend, and in the use of them, according to my
   mind, to grow up into holiness, in all manner of holy conversation,
   watching, fighting, resisting, contending with and against all the
   spiritual enemies of your souls. And as for me, this is my covenant
   with you, that my Spirit, which gives efficacy to all the means,
   ordinances, and advantages of gospel obedience, which I have afforded
   unto you, by whom I will fulfil in you all the good pleasure of my
   goodness, and the work of faith with power, so making you meet for the
   inheritance of the saints in light, and preserving you to my heavenly
   kingdom, shall never depart from you; so that you, also, having my law
   written in your hearts, shall never utterly and wickedly depart from
   me. And for such sins and follies as you shall be overtaken withal, I
   will graciously heal your backslidings, and receive you freely."

   This is the language of the doctrine we maintain; which is not, we full
   well know, obnoxious to any exceptions or consequences whatever, but
   such as bold and prejudiced men, for the countenance of their vain
   conceits and opinions, will venture at any time to impose and fasten on
   the most precious truths of the gospel. That God should say to
   believers, as is imposed on him, "fall into what sins they will, or
   abominations they can, yet he will have them believe that, by an
   irresistible hand, he will necessitate them to persevere," -- that is,
   in and under their apostasy, which is evidently implied in their
   falling into sins and abominations in the manner insisted on, -- is a
   ridiculous fiction, to the imagination whereof the least colour is not
   supplied by the doctrine intended to be traduced thereby.

   Secondly, For the ensuing exhortations, promises, and threatenings, as
   far as they are really evangelical, whose use and tendency is argued to
   be inconsistent with the doctrine before proposed, I have formerly
   manifested what is their proper use and efficacy in respect of
   believers; and their consistency with the truth we maintain,
   apprehended as it is indeed, and not vizarded with ugly and dreadful
   appearances, will, I presume, scarcely be called in question by any
   who, having "received a kingdom that cannot be moved," do know what it
   is to "serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear." It is
   true, they are made unto, and have their use in reference unto, them
   that believe and shall persevere therein; but they are not given unto
   them as men assured of their perseverance, but as men called to the use
   of means for the establishing of their souls in the ways of obedience.
   They are not, in the method of the gospel, irrationally happed on such
   intimations of unchangeable love, or proposed under such wild
   conditionals and suppositions as here by our author; but annexed to the
   appointment of those ways of grace and peace which God calls his saints
   unto, being suited to work upon the new nature wherewith they are
   endued, as spreading itself over all the faculties of their rational
   souls, wherein are principles fit to be excited to operation by
   exhortations and promises.

   Thirdly, All that is indeed argumentative in this discourse is built on
   this foundation, that a spiritual assurance of attaining the end by the
   use of means is discouraging and dissuasive to the use of those means;
   -- a proposition so uncouth in itself, so contradictory to the
   experience of all the saints of God, so derogatory to the glory and
   honour of Jesus Christ himself (who in all his obedience had,
   doubtless, an assurance of the end of it all), as any thing that can
   well fall into the imaginations of the hearts of men. Might not the
   devil have thus replied unto our Saviour, when he tempted him to turn
   stones into bread, and to cast himself from a pinnacle of the temple,
   and received answer that "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by
   every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God:" "But, alas! thou
   Jesus, the Son of the living God, that art persuaded thou art so, and
   that God will preserve thee, whether thou usest any means or no, that
   thou shalt never be starved for want of bread, nor hurt thyself by any
   fall, whatever thou dost, the angels having charge that no evil shall
   come nigh thee, nor thy foot be hurt against a stone, thou mayst now
   cast thyself headlong from the temple, to manifest thy assurance of the
   love and faithfulness of God in his promises to thee?" If our Saviour
   thought it sufficient to stop the mouth of the devil, to manifest from
   Scripture that notwithstanding the assurance from God that any one hath
   of the end, yet he is to use the means tending thereunto (a neglect
   whereof is a sinful tempting of God), we shall not need to go farther
   for an answer to the same kind of objection in the mouth of any
   adversary whatever.

   His 19th section containeth his fourth argument, in these words:--

   "If there be no possibility of the saints falling away finally, there
   is their persevering incapable of reward from God; but their final
   perseverance is not incapable of reward from God: ergo. The minor
   proposition, I presume, contains nothing but what is the sense of those
   who deny the conclusion; or, however, it contains nothing but what is
   the express sense of the Lord Christ, where he saith, that He that
   endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.' Therefore I suppose we
   shall be excused from farther proof of this, without any prejudice to
   the cause in hand."

   Ans. I grant eternal life may be called the reward of perseverance, in
   the sense that the Scripture useth that word, applied to the matter in
   hand. It is a reward neither procured by (properly and morally, as the
   deserving cause) nor proportioned unto the obedience of them by whom it
   is attained. A reward it is that withal is the free gift of God, and an
   inheritance purchased by Jesus Christ; a reward of bounty, and not of
   justice, in respect of them upon whom it is bestowed, but only of
   faithfulness in reference to the promise of it; a reward, by being a
   gracious encouragement, -- as the end of our obedience, not as the
   procurement or desert of it. So we grant it a reward of perseverance,
   though these words of our Saviour, "He that endureth to the end, the
   same shall be saved," express a consequence of things only, and not a
   connection of causality of the one upon the other. Of the foundation of
   this discourse concerning a possibility of declining, immediate
   consideration shall be had. He proceeds, then:--

   "The consequence of the major proposition stands firm upon this
   foundation: No act of the creature whereunto it is necessitated, or
   which it cannot possibly decline or but do, is, by any law of God or
   rule of justice, rewardable. Therefore, if the saints be necessitated
   by God to persevere finally, so that he leaves unto them no possibility
   of declining finally, their final perseverance is not, according to any
   law of God or man, nor, indeed, to any principle of reason or equity,
   capable of reward, no whit more than actions merely natural are; nay,
   of the two, there seems to be more reason why acts merely natural (as,
   for example, eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping) should be rewarded,
   inasmuch as these flow in a way of necessity, yet from an inward
   principle and connatural to the agent, than such actions whereunto the
   agent is constrained, necessitated, and determined, by a principle of
   power from without, and which is not intrinsical to it."

   And this is the strength of the argument, which will quickly appear to
   be very weakness; for, --

   First, The efficacy of these expressions, "Whereunto it is
   necessitated, and from it they cannot possibly decline," as to their
   influence into this argument, ariseth clearly from their ambiguity. We
   deny any to be necessitated to persevere, or that our doctrine affirms
   any such thing; taking that expression to hold out a power upon their
   wills, in their operations, inconsistent with the utmost liberty
   whereof in spiritual things (having received a spiritual principle) men
   are capable. They are not so necessitated to persevere as that all the
   acts of their obedience, whereby they do persevere, should not be free,
   but necessary. Indeed they are not at all, nor in any sense,
   necessitated to persevere. There is no necessity attends their
   perseverance but only in respect of the event, with reference to the
   unchangeable purpose and infallible promise of God. The like may be
   said of that other expression, "Possibility of declining." God leaves
   in them a possibility of declining as to their way and manner of
   walking with him, though he leaves not to them a possibility of
   declining or falling totally from him as to the issue and event of the
   whole matter; which doth not in the least necessitate them to or in any
   of their operations.

   Secondly, The proposition must be cast into another mould before it
   will be of any determinate signification in opposition to the doctrine
   it opposeth, and tuned to another mood before it will give a certain
   sound to any battle against it; and this is, That no act of the
   creature, that is wrought in order to the obtaining of any end promised
   to be certainly attained thereby, is rewardable of God (though for
   perseverance, it is not any act of the creature, but only a modus of
   its obedience). And thus it looks towards the concernment of this
   doctrine. Yet before this proposition pass, to omit sundry other things
   that would gladly rise to the destruction of it, I desire one query may
   be assailed, concerning the obedience of Jesus Christ, whether it were
   not necessary that the end of his obedience should follow? and whether
   it were not impossible he should decline from his obedience? and if it
   were, whether it were impossible that God should give a reward
   thereunto? But, --

   Thirdly, The intendment of this proposition, as far as it concerns us
   (and that, indeed, is with a respect to our doctrine of the efficacy of
   grace, and not to this of perseverance), is this, "That which is
   wrought in us by the effectual grace of God is not capable of reward
   from God;" -- a proposition which, though capable of some plea and
   colour, taking "reward" in a purely legal sense, supposing the persons
   seeking after it to do it by a service and duties proportioned unto it,
   yet is so openly and directly contradictory to the tenor and design of
   God in the covenant of grace by Jesus Christ, with the whole
   dispensation of the Spirit given to abide with believers, for all the
   ends and purposes as to their obedience, as that I shall content myself
   to deny it, expecting Mr Goodwin's proofs of it, -- when "rivers run
   backward, heavy things ascend," etc.

   Fourthly, For the flourish added to these assertions, by comparing the
   acts of the saints' obedience, upon a supposition of the grace of God
   "working them in them," with their natural actions of" eating,
   drinking, sleeping," as to their tendency to exalt the glory of God in
   rewarding, it proceeds either from gross ignorance of the doctrine
   opposed, or wilful prevaricating from that light of it which he hath.
   Who ever taught that God's operations in and towards believers, as to
   their perseverance in faith and obedience, did consist in an outward
   constraint of an unwilling principle? God gives a principle of
   obedience to them, -- he writes and implants his law in their hearts,
   and moves them effectually to act suitably to that inward principle
   they have so received; which, though spiritual and supernatural in
   respect of its rise and manner of bestowing, yet is connatural to them
   in respect of its being a principle of operation. We are not, then, in
   the least beholding to our author for his following concession, "That
   as a prince may give great things to them that eat, and drink, and
   breathe, but not as rewards; so God may give eternal life to them that
   are so necessitated by him to persevere, though not as a reward:" for
   although we will not contend with God about eternal life, that he [may]
   give it us under the notion of a reward, and desire to be much affected
   with the consideration of it as a free gift of grace, an eminent
   purchase of the blood of God, and look upon it merely as a reward of
   bounty, so called as being the end whereunto our obedience is suited,
   and the rest of our labours; yet we say, in an evangelical sense and
   acceptation it is properly so proposed to that obedience and
   perseverance therein which is wrought in us by the efficacy of the
   grace of God, as it lies in a tendency unto that end, which to be
   attained by those means he hath infallibly determined.

   He proceeds, therefore, to enforce his argument with a new
   consideration:--

   "If we speak of rewards promised in order to the moving or inclining of
   the wills of men towards such or such actions and ways, -- of which
   kind also the rewards mentioned in the Scriptures as yet remaining to
   be conferred by God upon men are, -- the ease is yet more clear,
   namely, that they are appropriate unto such actions and ways unto the
   election and choice whereof men are not necessitated in one kind or
   other, especially not by any physical or foreign power; for to what
   purpose should a reward be promised unto me, to persuade or make me
   willing to engage in such or such a course, or to perform such and such
   a service, in case I be necessitated to the same engagement or
   performance otherwise? Or what place is there left for a moral
   inducement where a physical necessity hath done the execution? Or, if
   the moral inducement hath done the execution, and sufficiently raised
   and engaged the will to the action, with what congruity of reason, yea,
   or common sense, can a physical necessity be superinduced?"

   Ans. What there is more in this than what went before, unless sophistry
   and falsity, I see not; for, -- First, Though I conceive that eternal
   life is proposed in the Scripture as our reward rather upon the account
   of supporting and cheering our spirits in the deficiencies,
   temptations, and entanglements attending our obedience, than directly
   to engage unto obedience (though consequently it doth that also),
   whereunto we have so many other unconquerable engagements and
   inducements, yet the consideration thereof in that sense also, as it
   moves the wills of men to actions suitable to the attainment of it, is
   very well consistent with the doctrine in hand. That old calumny, a
   hundred times repeated and insisted on in this contest, of our wills
   being necessitated and deprived of their choice and election, unless it
   could be tolerably made good, will be of no use to Mr Goodwin as to his
   present purpose. The whole strength of this argumentation is built on
   this supposal, that the effectual grace of God in its working the will
   and deed in believers, or the Spirit's doing of it by grace, with God's
   fore-determination of events, doth take away the liberty of the will,
   inducing into it a necessary manner of operation, -- determining it to
   one antecedently in order of time to its own determination of itself;
   which is false, and no wise inferred from the doctrine under
   consideration. Yea, as God's providential concurrence with men and
   determination of their wills to all their actions as actions is the
   principle of all their natural liberty, so his gracious concurrence
   with them, or operation in them, as unto spiritual effects, working in
   them to will, is the principle of all their true spiritual liberty.
   When "the Son makes us free, then are we free indeed." The reward,
   then, is proposed to an understanding enlightened, a will quickened and
   made free by grace, to stir them up to actions suitable to them who are
   in expectation of so bountiful a close of their obedience (which
   actions are yet wrought in them by the Spirit of God, whose fruits they
   are); and this to very good purpose, in the hearts of all that know
   what it is to walk with God, and to serve him in the midst of
   temptations, unless they are under the power of some such particular
   error as turns away their eyes from believing the truth.

   Secondly, The opposition here pretended between a physical
   necessitating and a moral inducement for the producing of the same
   effect, is, in plain terms, intended between the efficacy of God's
   internal grace and the use of external exhortations and motives. If God
   give an internal principle, or spiritual habit, fitting for, inclining
   to, spiritual actions and duties; if he follow the work so begun in us
   (who yet of ourselves can do nothing, nor are sufficient to think a
   good thought) with continual supplies of his Spirit and grace, working
   daily in us, according to the exceeding greatness of his power, the
   things that are well pleasing in his sight; -- then, though he work
   upon us as creatures endued with reason, understandings, wills, and
   affections, receiving glory from us according to the nature he hath
   endued us withal, all exhortations and encouragements to obedience
   required at our hands are vain and foolish. Now, because we think this
   to be the very wisdom of God, and the opposition made unto it to be a
   mere invention of Satan to magnify corrupted nature and decry all the
   efficacy of the grace of the new covenant, we must have something
   besides and beyond the naked assertion of our author to cause us once
   to believe it.

   Thirdly, The great execution that is made by moral inducement solely,
   without any internally efficacious grace, in the way of gospel
   obedience, is often supposed, but not once attempted to be put upon the
   proof or demonstration. It shall, then, suffice to deny that any
   persuasions, outward motives, or inducements whatever, are able of
   themselves to raise, engage, and carry out, the will unto action, so
   that any good, spiritual action should be brought forth on that
   account, without the effectual influence and physical operation of
   internal grace; and Mr Goodwin is left to prove it, together with such
   other assertions derogatory to the free grace of God, dogmatically
   imposed upon his reader in this chapter, whereof some have been already
   remarked, and others may in due time. The residue of this section (the
   19th), spent to prove that eternal life is given as reward to
   perseverance, -- having already manifested the full consistency of the
   proposition, in a gospel acceptation of the word "reward," with
   whatever we teach of the perseverance of the saints, -- I suppose
   myself unconcerned in; and therefore, passing by the triumphant
   conclusion of this argument, asserting an absolute power in men to
   exhibit or decline from obedience, I shall go on to that which, in my
   apprehension, is of more importance, and will give occasion to a
   discourse, I hope, not unuseful or unprofitable to the reader. I shall
   therefore assign it a peculiar place and chapter to itself.

   Mr Goodwin's fifth argument for the saints' apostasy is taken from the
   consideration of the sins which they have fallen into, or possibly may
   so do, and it is thus proposed: sect. 20, --

   "They who are in a capacity or possibility of perpetrating the works of
   the flesh are in a possibility of perishing, and consequently in a
   possibility of falling away, and that finally, from the grace and
   favour of God, in case they be in an estate of his grace and favour at
   the present; but the saints, or true believers, are in a possibility of
   perpetrating the works of the flesh: and therefore also they are in a
   possibility of perishing, and so of falling away from the grace and
   favour of God, wherein at present they stand. The major proposition of
   this argument, -- to wit, They who are in a possibility of perpetrating
   or customarily acting the works of the flesh, are in a possibility of
   perishing, -- is clearly proved from all such scriptures which exclude
   all workers of iniquity and fulfillers of the lusts of the flesh from
   the kingdom of God, of which sort are many: Of the which,' saith the
   apostle, speaking of the lusts of the flesh, adultery, fornication,
   etc., I tell you, as I have also told you in time past, that they who
   do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.' So again, For
   this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous
   man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ
   and of God.' Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of
   these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
   disobedience.' Yet again, Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God?' Be not deceived, neither fornicators nor
   idolaters shall inherit the kingdom of God.' From such passages as
   these, which are very frequent in the Scriptures, it is as clear as the
   light of the sun at noon-day, that they who may possibly commit such
   sins as those specified, adultery, fornication, idolatry, may as
   possibly perish and be for ever excluded the kingdom of God."

   Ans. Because, of all arguments whatever used against the truth we
   assert, this seems to me to wear the best colours on its back, and to
   have its face best painted, namely, with that plea of the
   "inconsistency of sin with the favour and acceptation of God," seeming
   to have a tendency to caution believers in their ways and walkings to
   be more careful in watching against temptations, I shall more largely
   insist on what the Lord hath been pleased to reveal concerning the sins
   and failings of such as he is yet pleased to accept in a covenant of
   mercy; whom though he chastens and sorely rebukes, yet he gives not
   their souls over unto death, nor takes his loving-kindness from them
   for ever. Now, because the inside and strength of this objection
   consists in a comparison instituted between the sins of believers and
   the sins of unregenerate persons, which being laid in the balance are
   found of equal burdensomeness unto God, and therefore are in expectance
   of a like reward from him, I shall in the first place, before I come in
   particular to answer the argument proposed, manifest the difference
   that is between regenerate persons and unregenerate in their sinning,
   and consequently also between their sins; wherein such principles shall
   be laid down and proved as may with an easy application remove all that
   is added in the farther carrying on and endeavoured vindication of the
   argument in hand.

   A foundation of this discourse we have laid in James i. 14, 15, "But
   every man is tempted," saith the Holy Ghost, "when he is drawn away of
   his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth
   forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death." The
   Holy Ghost discovers the fountain of all sin, and pursues it in the
   streams of it into the dead sea, whereinto it falls. All sin whatever
   is from temptation, and that which tempts to all sin is the cause of
   all sin. This fountain of sin is here discovered, the principal,
   proper, criminal cause of sin, in the beginning of verse 14. The
   adversative "but" is exclusive of any other faulty cause of sin that
   should principally fall under our consideration, especially of God, of
   whom mention was made immediately before. Now, this is affirmed to be
   every man's "lust." The general way and means that this original of all
   sin useth for the production of it is also discovered, and that is
   "temptation." Every man's own lust tempts him. The progress also it
   makes in carrying on of sin whereunto it tempts is farther described in
   the several parts and degrees of it:-- 1. It draws away and entices,
   and the persons towards whom it exerts this efficacy are "drawn away
   and enticed;" 2. It conceives, "Lust conceives." The subject being
   prepared, answering its drawing away and enticing, without more ado it
   conceives sin; and then it brings forth into action, -- that is, either
   into open perpetration or deliberate determination of its
   accomplishment; and then it "finisheth sin," or comes up to the whole
   work that sin tends to; whereunto is subjoined the dismal end and issue
   of this progress of sin, which is "death." Eternal death is in the womb
   of finished sin, and will be brought forth by it.

   This being the progress of sin from the first rise, which is "lust," to
   the last end, which is "death," the way and path that the best and most
   refined unregenerate men in the world do never thoroughly forsake,
   though they may sometimes step out of it or be stopped in it, a way
   wherein whoever walks to the end may be sure to find the end, I shall
   consider the several particulars laid down, and show in them all, at
   least in the most material, the difference that is between believers
   and unbelievers whilst they do walk, or may walk, in this path, and
   then manifest where and when all saints break out of it for ever, so
   that they come not to the close thereof; and therein I shall give a
   full answer unto the whole strength and design of the argument in hand,
   which consisteth, as was said, in a comparison instituted between the
   sins and demerits of believers and unbelievers.

   First, The fountain, principle, and cause, of all sin whatever, in all
   persons whatever, is "lust." Every one's own lust is the cause of his
   own sin. This is the mother, womb, and fomes of sin, which Paul says he
   had not been acquainted withal but by the law: Rom. vii. 7, "Nay, I had
   not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law
   had said, Thou shalt not covet." That which in the entrance he calls
   "sin" indefinitely, in the close he particularly terms "lust," as being
   the hidden, secret cause of all sin, and which, once discovered,
   swallows up the thoughts of all other sins, it being altogether in vain
   to deal with them, or to set a man's self in opposition to them, whilst
   this sinful womb of them is alive and prevalent. This is that which we
   call original sin, as to that part of it which consists in the
   universal alienation of our hearts from God, and unconquerable,
   habitual, natural inclination of them to every thing that is evil; for
   this sin works in us "all manner of concupiscence," Rom. vii. 8. This,
   I say, is the womb, cause, and principle of sin, both in believers and
   unbelievers, the root on which the bitter fruit of it doth grow,
   wherever it is. No man ever sins but it is from his own lust. And in
   this there is an agreement between the sins of believers and others,
   they are all from the same fountain; yet not such an agreement but that
   there is a difference herein also. For the clearing whereof observe, --

   1. That by nature this lust, which is the principle of sin, is seated
   in all the faculties of the soul, receiving divers appellations
   according to the variety of the subjects wherein it is, and is
   sometimes expressed in terms of privation, want, and deficiency,
   sometimes by positive inclination to evil. In the understanding, it is
   blindness, darkness, giddiness, folly, madness; in the will, obstinacy
   and rebellion; in the heart and affections, pride, stubbornness,
   hardness, sensuality; in all, negatively and privatively, death;
   positively, lust, corruption, flesh, concupiscence, sin, the old man,
   and the like. There is nothing in the soul of a man that hath the least
   influence into any action as moral but is wholly possessed with this
   depraved, vicious habit, and exerts itself always and only in a
   suitableness thereunto.

   2. That this lust hath so taken possession of men by nature, that, in
   reference to any spiritual act or duty, they are nothing else but lust
   and flesh: "That which is born of the flesh is flesh," John iii. 6. It
   is all so, it is all spiritual flesh; that is, it is wholly and
   habitually corrupt, as to the doing any thing that is good. If any
   thing in a man might seem to be exempted, it should be his mind, the
   seat of all those things which are commonly called the "relics of the
   image of God;" but that also is flesh, as the apostle at large asserts
   it, Rom. viii., and "enmity against God." Neither is it of any weight
   which is objected, "That there is in unregenerate men the knowledge of
   the truth, which they retain in unrighteousness, Rom. i. 18; conscience
   accusing and excusing, chap. ii. 15; the knowledge of sin which is by
   the law, with sundry other endowments; which," they say, "doubtless are
   not flesh." I answer, They are all flesh, in the sense that the
   Scripture useth that word. The Holy Ghost speaks of nothing in man, in
   reference unto any duty of obedience unto God, but it is either flesh
   or Spirit. These two comprehend every man in the world: Every man is
   either in the flesh or in the Spirit, Rom. viii. The utmost improvement
   of all natural faculties whatever, the most complete subjection
   whereunto they are brought by convictions, yet leaves the same
   impotency in them to spiritual good as they were born withal, the same
   habitual inclination to sin, however entangled and hampered from going
   out to the actual perpetrating of it; neither are they themselves any
   thing the better, nor hath God any thing of that glory by them which
   ariseth from the willing obedience of his creatures.

   3. It being the state of every man's proper lust which is the fountain
   of all sin, two things will follow:--

   (1.) That in whomsoever it is, in its compass and power, as above
   described, as it is in every unregenerate man, however convinced of
   sin, he sins with his full and whole consent. All that is within him
   consents to every sin he commits. Unregenerate men sin with their whole
   hearts and souls. In every act their carnal minds are not, will not be,
   subject to the law of God. Their wills and all their affections delight
   in sin; and this because there is no principle in them that should make
   any opposition to sin, -- I mean such a spiritual opposition as would
   really take off from their full consent. It is true, conscience
   repines, witnesses against sin, reproves, rebukes, excuses or accuses:
   but conscience is no real principle of operation, but either a judge of
   what is done or to be done, or a moral inducer to doing or not doing;
   and whatever conscience doth, however it tumultuate, rebuke, chide,
   persuade, trouble, cry, and the like, whatever conviction of the guilt
   of sin may show into the judgment, yet sin hath the consent of the
   whole soul. Every thing that hath a real influence into operation
   consents thereto, originally and radically, however any principle may
   be dared by conscience. To take off any thing from full consent, there
   must be something of a spiritual repugnancy in the mind and will, which
   when lust is thus enthroned there is not.

   (2.) That sin reigneth in such persons. Many have been the inquiries of
   learned men about the reigning of sin; as, what sins may be said to
   reign, and what not? whether sins of ignorance may reign as well as
   sins against knowledge? what little sins may be said to reign as well
   as great? whether frequent relapses into any sin prove that sin to be
   reigning? whether sin may reign in a regenerate person? or whether a
   saint may fall into reigning sin? whereabout divines of great note and
   name have differed, all upon a false bottom and supposal. The Scripture
   gives no ground for any such inquiries, or disputes, or cases of
   conscience, as some men have raised hereupon; and, indeed, I would this
   were the only instance of men's creating cases of conscience and
   answering them, when indeed and in truth there are no such things; so
   ensnaring the consciences of men, and entangling more by their cases
   than they deliver by their resolutions. The truth is, there is no
   mention of any reigning sin, or the reigning of any sin, in the whole
   book of God, taking sin for this or that particular sin; but of the
   reign of this indwelling, original lust, or fountain of all sin, there
   is frequent mention. Whilst that holds its power and universality in
   the soul, and is not restrained nor straitened by the indwelling Spirit
   of grace, with a new vital principle of no less extent and of more
   power than it, be the actual sins few or more, known or unknown, little
   or great, all is one. Sin reigns, and such a person is under the power
   and dominion of sin. So that, in plain terms, to have sin reign is to
   be unconverted; and to have sin not to reign is to be converted, to
   have received a new principle of life from above. This is evident from
   the 5th and 6th chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, the seat of this
   doctrine of reigning sin. The opposition insisted on by the apostle, is
   between the reign of sin and grace; and in pursuit thereof he manifests
   how true believers are translated from the one to the other. To have
   sin reign, is to be in a state of sin; to have grace reign, is to be in
   a state of grace. So chap. v. 21, "As sin hath reigned unto death, so
   grace reigneth through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ
   our Lord." The sin he speaks of is that whereof he treats in all that
   chapter, the sin of nature, the lust whereof we speak. This by nature
   reigneth unto death; but when grace comes by Jesus Christ, the soul is
   delivered froth the power thereof. So in the whole 6th chapter it is
   our change of state and condition that the apostle insists on, in our
   delivery from the reign of sin; and he tells us this is that that
   destroys it, our being under grace: Verse 14, "Sin shall not have
   dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace."
   Plainly, then, there are two lords and rulers; and these are, original
   or indwelling sin, and grace or the Spirit of it. The first lord the
   apostle discovers, with his entrance upon his rule and dominion, chap.
   v., and this all men by nature are under; the second he describes,
   chap. vi., which sets out the rule and reign of grace in believers by
   Jesus Christ. And then, thirdly, the place that both these lords have,
   in this life, in a believer, chap. vii. This, then, is the only
   reigning sin; and in whomsoever it is in its power and compass, as it
   is in all unregenerate men, in them, and in them only, doth sin reign,
   and every sin they commit is with full consent (as was manifested
   before), in exact willing obedience to the sovereign lord that reigns
   in them.

   4. Observe that the grace, new creature, principle, or spiritual life,
   that is given to, bestowed on, and wrought in, all and only believers,
   be it in the lowest and most remiss degree that can be imagined, is yet
   no less universally spread over the whole soul than the contrary habit
   and principle of lust and sin whereof we have spoken. In the
   understanding it is light in the Lord; in the will, life; in the
   affections, love, delight, etc., those being reconciled who were
   alienated by wicked works. Wherever there is any thing the least of
   grace, there something of it is in every thing of the soul that is a
   capable seat for good or evil habits or dispositions. He that is "in
   Christ is a new creature," 2 Cor. v. 17; not renewed in one or other
   particular, -- "he is a new creature."

   5. That wherever true grace is, in what degree soever, there it bears
   rule, though sin be in the same subject with it. As sin reigns before
   grace comes, so grace reigns when it doth once come. And the reason is,
   because sin having the first rule and dominion in the heart, abiding
   there, there is neither room nor place for grace but what is made by
   conquest; now, whoever enters into a possession by right of conquest.,
   what resistance soever be made, if he prevail to a conquest, he reigns.
   In every regenerate man, though grace be never so weak, and corruption
   never so strong, yet properly the sovereignty belongs to grace. Having
   entered upon the soul and all the powers of it by conquest, so long as
   it abides there it doth reign. So that to say a regenerate man may fall
   into reigning sin, as it is commonly expressed (though, as we have
   manifested, no sin reigns but the sin of nature, as no good act
   reigneth but the Spirit and habit of grace), and yet continue
   regenerate, is all one as to say he may have and not have true grace at
   the same time.

   Now, from these considerations some farther inferences may be made:--
   (1.) That in every regenerate person there are, in a spiritual sense,
   two principles of all his actings, -- two wills. There is the will of
   the flesh, and there is the will of the Spirit. A regenerate man is
   spiritually and in Scripture expression two men, -- a "new man" and an
   "old," an "inward man" and a "body of death," -- and hath two wills,
   having two natures, not as natural faculties, but as moral principles
   of operation; and this keeps all his actions, as moral, from being
   perfect, absolute, or complete in any kind. He doth good with his whole
   heart upon the account of sincerity, but he doth not good with his
   whole heart upon the account of perfection; and when he doth evil,
   there is still a non-submitting, an unconsenting principle. This the
   apostle complains of and declares, Rom. vii. 19-22, "The good that I
   would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now if I do
   that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
   me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with
   me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man."

   There is an "I" and an "I" at opposition, a willing and not willing, a
   doing and not doing, a delighting and not delighting, all in the same
   person. So that there is this difference at the entrance between what
   sin soever of regenerate persons and others: Though the principle of
   sinning be the same, for the kind and nature of it, in them and others,
   -- all sin, every man's sins, be who he will, believer or unbeliever,
   being tempted by his own lust, -- yet that lust possesseth the whole
   soul, and takes in the virtual consent of the whole man,
   notwithstanding the control and checks of conscience and the light of
   the judgment, in him that is unregenerate; but in every regenerate
   person there is an unconsenting principle, which is as truly the man
   himself, that doth not concur in sin, that doth expressly dissent from
   it, as the other is from whence it flows.

   (2.) That sin neither can, doth, nor ever shall, reign in regenerate
   persons. The reason of this I acquainted you with before; and the
   apostle thinks this a sufficient proof of this assertion, "Because they
   are under grace," Rom. vi. 14. Whilst the principle of grace abides in
   them, which reigns wherever it be, or the free acceptance of God in the
   gospel is towards them, it is impossible, upon the account of any
   actual sin whatever whereinto they may fall, that sin should reign in
   them. Nothing gives sin a reign and dominion but a total defect of all
   true grace whatever, not only as to the exerting itself, but as to any
   habitual relics of it. It may be overwhelmed sometimes with temptations
   and corruptions, but it is grace still, as the least spark of fire is
   fire, though it should be covered with never so great a heap of ashes;
   and it reigns then.

   (3.) That regenerate persons sin not with their whole and full consent.
   Consent may be taken two ways:-- First, Morally, for the approbation of
   the thing done. So the apostle says, that in the inward man he did
   "consent to the law that it was good," Rom. vii. 16; that is, he did
   approve it as such, like it, delight in it as good: and thus a
   regenerate man never consents to sin, no, nor unregenerate persons
   neither, unless they are such as, "being past feeling, are given up to
   work lasciviousness with greediness." A regenerate person is so far
   from thus consenting to sin, that before it, in it, after it, he
   utterly condemns, disallows, hates it, as in himself and by himself
   committed. Secondly, Consent may be taken in a physical sense, for the
   concurrence of the commanding and acting principles of the soul unto
   its operations. And in this sense an unregenerate man sins with his
   full consent and his whole will. A regenerate man doth not, cannot do
   so: for though there is not in that consent to sin which his will,
   inclined by the remaining disposition of sin in it, doth give, an
   actual sensible reaction of the other principle, yet there is an
   express not-consenting; and by the power that it hath in the soul (for
   habits have power in and over the subjects wherein they are), it
   preserves it from being wholly engaged into sin. And this is the great
   intendment of the apostle, Rom. vii. 19-22.

   From what hath been spoken will easily appear what answer may be given
   to the former argument, to wit, that notwithstanding any sins that
   either the Scripture or the experience of men doth evince that the
   saints may fall into, yet that they never sin or perpetrate sin with
   their full and whole consent, whereby they should be looked upon in and
   under their sins in the same state and condition with unregenerate
   persons, in whom sin reigneth, committing the same sin. And how
   insufficient any thing produced by Mr Goodwin in defence of the
   argument laid down at the entrance of this chapter, is to remove the
   answer given unto it from believers not sinning with their whole
   consent, may easily be demonstrated. This he thus proposeth:--

   "Some, to maintain this position, that all the sins of true believers
   are sins of infirmity, lay hold on this shield: Such men,' they say,
   never sin with their whole wills, or with full consent; therefore they
   never sin but through infirmity.' That they never sin with full consent
   they conceive they prove sufficiently from that of the apostle, For the
   good that I would I do not: but the evil that I would not, that I do.
   Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that
   dwelleth in me.' I answer, first, That the saints cannot sin but with
   their whole wills or full consents is undeniably proved by this
   consideration, -- namely, because otherwise there should be not only a
   plurality or diversity, but also a contrariety of wills in the same
   person at one and the same instant of time, namely, when the supposed
   act of evil is produced. Now, it is an impossibility of the first
   evidence that there should be a plurality of acts, and these contrary
   one to the other, in the same subject or agent at one or the same
   instant of time. It is true, between the first movings of the flesh in
   a man towards the committing of the sin and the completing of the sin
   by an actual and external patration of it, there may be successively in
   him not only a plurality but even a contrariety of volitions or motions
   of the will, according to what the Scripture speaketh concerning the
   flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; but
   when the flesh, having prevailed in the combat, bringeth forth her
   desire into act, the Spirit ceaseth from his act of lusting: otherwise
   it would follow that the flesh is greater and stronger in her lusting
   than the Spirit of God is in his, and that when the flesh lusteth after
   the perpetration of such or such a sin, the Spirit as to the hindering
   of it lusteth but in vain; which is contrary to that of the apostle,
   Greater is he that is in you' (speaking, as it is clear, of the Spirit
   of God unto true believers) than he that is in the world,' meaning
   Satan and all his auxiliaries, -- sin, flesh, corruption."

   Ans. What we intend by the saints not sinning with their whole wills
   hath been declared. That there is not a consistency in the explanation
   we have given Mr Goodwin asserts, because it would infer "a plurality,
   yea a contrariety of wills in the same person at the same time." That
   there is a plurality, yea a contrariety of wills, in the Scripture
   sense of the expression of the will of a man, was before from the
   Scripture declared; not a plurality of wills in a physical sense, as
   the will is a natural faculty of the soul, but in a moral and
   analogical sense, as it is taken for a habit or principle of good or
   evil. The will is a natural faculty. One nature hath one will. In every
   regenerate man there are two natures, the new or divine, and the old or
   corrupted. In the same sense, there are in him two wills, as was
   declared. But saith he, "It is an impossibility of the first evidence,
   that there should be a plurality of acts in the same subject at the
   same time, and these contrary one to another." But, --

   1. If you intend acts in a moral consideration, unless you add, "About
   the same object," which you do not, this assertion is so far from any
   evidence of truth, that it is ridiculously false. May not the same
   person love God and hate the devil at the same time? But, --

   2. How pass you so suddenly from a plurality of wills to a plurality of
   acts? By the will we intend (in the sense wherein we speak of it) a
   habit, not any act, -- that is, the will as habitually invested with a
   new principle, and not as actually willing from thence and by virtue
   thereof. Arminius, from whom our author borrows this discourse, fell
   not into this sophistry; he tells you, "There cannot be contrary wills
   or volitions about the same act." But is it with Mr Goodwin or Arminius
   an impossibility that there should be a mixed action, partly voluntary
   and partly involuntary? Actions whose principles are from without, by
   persuasion, may be; so a man's throwing his goods into the sea to save
   his own life. Now, the principles whereof we speak, flesh and grace,
   are internal and contrary; and shall not the actions that proceed from
   a faculty wherein such contrary principles have their residence he
   partly voluntary, partly involuntary?

   But he tells you, "That though there might be lusting of the Spirit
   against the flesh before the act of sin, yet when it comes to the
   acting of it then it ceaseth; and so the act is wrought with the whole
   will."

   1. Though this were so, yet this doth not prove but that the action is
   mixed, and not absolutely and wholly voluntary. Mixed actions are so
   esteemed from the antecedent deliberation and dissent, though the will
   be at length prevailed upon thereunto; and I have showed before that in
   the very action there is a virtual dissent, because of the opposite
   principle that is in the will. But, --

   2. How doth it appear that the Spirit doth not "lust against the flesh"
   (though not to a prevalency) even in the exertion of the acts of sin?
   In every good act that a man doth, because evil is present with him,
   though the prevalency be on the part of the Spirit and the principle of
   grace, yet the flesh also with its lustings doth always in part corrupt
   it; thence are all the spots, stains, and imperfections of the holy
   things and duties of the saints. And if the flesh in its lusting will
   immix itself with our good actions to their defilement and impairing,
   why may not the Spirit in the ill [actions] not only immix itself and
   its lustings therewith, but bear off from the full influence of the
   will into them which otherwise it would have?

   But saith he, "If the Spirit doth not cease lusting before the flesh
   bring forth the act of sin, then is the Spirit conquered by the flesh,
   contrary to that of the apostle, 1 John iv. 4, Stronger is he that is
   in you than he that is in the world.'?" But, --

   1. If from hence the flesh must be thought and conceived to be stronger
   than the Spirit, because it prevails in any act unto sin,
   notwithstanding the contending of the Spirit, how much more must it be
   judged to prevail over it and to conquer it if it cause it utterly to
   cease, and not to strive at all! He that restrains another that he
   shall not oppose him at all hath a greater power than he who conquers
   him in his resistance. But why doth Mr Goodwin fear lest the flesh
   should be asserted to be stronger in us than the Spirit? Is not his
   whole design to prove that it is, or may be, so much stronger and more
   prevalent than it, that whereas it is confessed on all hands that the
   Spirit doth never wholly conquer the flesh, so that it shall not remain
   in the saints in this life, yet that the flesh doth wholly prevail over
   the Spirit and conquer it, to an utter expulsion of it out of the
   hearts of them in whom it is?

   2. In the prevalency of the flesh, it is not the Spirit himself that is
   conquered, but only some motions and actings of him in the heart. Now,
   though some particular actings and motions of his may not come out
   eventually unto success, yet if he generally bear rule in the heart, he
   is not to be said, even as in us and acting in us, not to be stronger
   than the flesh. He is, as in us, on this account said to be "stronger
   than he that is in the world," because, notwithstanding all the
   opposition that is against us, he preserveth us in our state and
   condition of acceptation with God, and walking with him with an upright
   heart, in good works and duties for the most part, though sometimes the
   flesh prevails unto sin, from which yet he recovers us by repentance.

   3. To speak a little to Mr Goodwin's sense. By the Spirit's
   insufficiency, it is manifest, from the text urged, and from what
   follows in the same place, that he intends not a spiritual vital
   principle in the will, having its residence there, with its contrary
   principle, the flesh (perhaps he will grant no such thing), but the
   Spirit of God himself. How, now, doth this Spirit lust? Not formally,
   doubtless, but by causing us so to do. And how doth it do that, in Mr
   Goodwin's judgment? Merely by persuading of us so to do. So that to
   have the flesh prevail against the Spirit is nothing, in his sense, but
   to have sin prevail and the motives of the flesh above the motives used
   by the Spirit; which may be done, and yet the Spirit continue
   unquestionably stronger than the flesh.

   4. The sum is, If the Spirit and the flesh, lust and grace, may be
   looked on as habitual qualities and principles in the wills of the same
   persons, so that though a man hath but one will, yet, by reason of
   these contrary qualities, he is to be esteemed as having two diverse
   principles of operation, it is evident that, having contrary
   inclinations continually, the will hath in its actings a relation to
   both these principles, so that no sin is committed by such an one with
   his whole will and full consent. That contrary qualities in a remiss
   degree may be in the same subject is known "lippis et tonsoribus."
   These adverse principles, the flesh and Spirit, are as those contrary
   qualities of the same subject; and the inclinations, yea, and the
   elicit acts of the will, are of the same nature with them: so that in
   the same act they may both be working, though not with equal efficacy.
   Notwithstanding any thing, then, said to the contrary, it appears that
   in the sins which the saints fall into, they do not sin with their
   whole wills and full consent; which of itself is a sufficient answer to
   the foregoing argument.

   Sect. 25 contains a discourse too long to be imposed upon the reader by
   a transcription. There are three parts of it: the first rendering a
   reason whence it is, that, "if the Spirit be stronger than the flesh,
   yet the flesh doth often prevail in its lusting." The second, "The way
   of the Spirit's return, to act in us after its motions have been
   rejected." The third endeavours a proof of the proposition denied,
   "That the saints sin with their full and whole consent," by the example
   of David.

   For the first, he tells you, "That the Spirit acts not to the just
   efficacy of its vigour and strength, but only when his preventing
   motions are entertained and seconded with a suitable concurrence in the
   hearts and wills of men; through a deficiency and neglect whereof he is
   said to be grieved' and: quenched,' -- that is, to cease from other
   actings or movings in men. This truth is the ground of such and such
   sayings in the epistles of Paul: For if ye live after the flesh, ye
   shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the
   body, ye shall live.' For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they
   are the sons of God,'?" etc.

   Ans. The Spirit here intended by Mr Goodwin is the holy and blessed
   Spirit of grace. What his actings to the just efficacy of his vigour
   and strength are, Mr Goodwin doth not explain; nor, indeed,
   notwithstanding the seeming significancy of that expression, is he
   able. It must be to act either as much as he can or as much as he will.
   That the Holy Spirit, in opposing sin, acts to the utmost extent of his
   omnipotency in any, I suppose will not be affirmed. If it be as much as
   he will, then the sense is, he will not in such cases act as much as he
   will. What that signifies we want some other expressive phrase to
   declare. To let this pass, let us see, in the next place, what his
   acting to this just efficacy are suspended upon; it is, then, in case
   "his first preventing motions be received and seconded." But then,
   secondly, what are these "first preventing motions" of the Spirit? and
   what is it to entertain them with a suitable concurrence of the will?
   For the first, Mr Goodwin tells us in this section they are "motions of
   a cool and soft inspiration." Such cloudy expressions, in a thing of
   this moment, are we forced to embrace! "Preventing motions of the
   Spirit" are either internal physical acts, in, with, and upon the wills
   of men, working in them to will and to do (called "preventing" from the
   actings of the wills themselves), or they are moral insinuations and
   persuasions to good, according to the analogy of the doctrine Mr
   Goodwin hath espoused. It is the latter only that are here intended.
   The "preventing motions of the Spirit" are his moral persuasions of the
   will to the good proposed to its consideration.

   See, then, in the next place, what it is to "second and entertain these
   motions with a suitable concurrence in the heart and will." Now, this
   must be either to yield obedience to these motions, and do the good
   persuaded unto, or something else. If any thing else, we desire to know
   of Mr Goodwin what it is, and wherein it consists. If it be to do the
   good persuaded to, then what becomes, I pray you, of those "subsequent
   helps" which are suspended upon this obedience, when the thing itself
   is already performed which their help and assistance is required unto?
   They may well be called "subsequent motions" which are never used nor
   applied but when the things whereunto they move and provoke are
   beforehand accomplished and performed; yea, they are suspended on that
   condition.

   Farther; wherein do these "subsequent helps," as it is expressed, which
   move at a more high and glorious rate, consist? We have had it
   sufficiently argued already, to a thorough conviction of what is Mr
   Goodwin's judgment in this matter, namely, that he acknowledgeth no
   operations in or upon the wills of men but what are moral, by the way
   of persuasion, contending, to the utmost efficacy of his vigour and
   strength in disputing, that there is an inconsistency between physical,
   internal operations in or upon the will of men, and moral exhortations
   or persuasions, as to the production of the same effect. This, then, is
   the frame of this fine discourse: "If, upon the Spirit's first
   persuasion to good, men yield obedience and do it accordingly, the
   Spirit will then with more power and vigour move them when they have
   done it, and persuade them to do it." That this discourse of his doth
   readily administer occasion and advantage to retort upon him his third
   argument, formerly considered, of imposing incoherent and inconsistent
   reasonings and actings upon God in his dealings with men, the
   intelligent reader will quickly find out; -- and it were an easy thing
   to erect a theatre, and, upon Mr Goodwin's principles, to personate the
   Almighty with an incongruous and incoherent discourse; but we fear God.

   Thirdly, That the Spirit is grieved with the sins of believers, and
   their walking unworthily of, or not answerably to, the grace they have
   received, is clear, Eph. iv. 30: the apostle admonisheth believers to
   abstain from the sins he there enumerates, and consequently [from]
   others of the like import, [and] having put on and learned Christ unto
   sanctification, that they do not grieve the Spirit, from whom they have
   received that great mercy and privilege of being "sealed to the day of
   redemption." But that therefore the subsequent and more effectual
   motions of the Spirit are not free as the first, but suspended on our
   performance of that which he first moves unto, and so, consequently,
   that there is neither first nor second motion of the Spirit but may be
   rendered useless and fruitless, or be for ever perverted, is an
   argument not unlike that of the Papists, "Peter, feed my sheep;
   therefore the pope is head of the church."

   The ensuing discourse also is not to be passed without a little
   animadversion. Thus, then, he proceeds: "Believers," saith he, "do then
   mortify the deeds of the body by the Spirit, when they join their wills
   unto his in his preventing motions of grace, and so draw and obtain
   farther strength and assistance from him in order to the great and
   difficult work of mortification; in respect of which concurrence also
   with the Spirit, in his first and more gentle applications of himself
   to them, they are said to be led by the Spirit,' as in their
   comportment with him, in his higher and farther applications, they
   become filled with the Spirit, according to the expression of the
   apostle, Be ye filled with the Spirit;' that is, Follow the Spirit
   close in his present motions and suggestions within you, and you shall
   be filled with him;' that is, Ye shall find him moving and assisting
   you upon all occasions at a higher and more glorious rate.'?"

   Ans. 1. What this "joining of our wills to the will of the Spirit" is
   was in part manifested before. The "will of the Spirit" is that we be
   mortified. His motions hereunto are his persuasions that we be so. To
   join our wills to his, is in our will to answer the will of the Spirit;
   that is, upon the Spirit's motions, we mortify ourselves. By this also,
   he tells us, we draw or obtain farther strength or assistance from the
   Spirit for that work which we have done already. But how so? Why, he
   tells you afterward that this is the "law of the Spirit." It seems,
   then, that by doing one thing, we obtain or procure the assistance of
   the Spirit for another, and that by a law. I ask, By what law? by the
   law of works? By that law the apostle tells you that we do not at all
   receive the Spirit; therefore, by a parity of reason, we obtain not any
   farther supplies from him by that law. By the law of faith or grace?
   That law knows nothing of such terms as that we should by any acting of
   ours procure the Holy Spirit of God, which he freely bestows according
   to the main tenor of that law. Farther; how is this second grace
   obtained, and what is the law of the Spirit therein? Is it obtained ex
   congruo or ex condigno? Produce the rule of God's proceeding with his
   saints, or any of the sons of men, in the matter of any gracious
   behovement of his, and you will outdo whatever your predecessors,
   whether Pelagians, Papists, Arminians, or Socinians, could yet attain
   unto. Our Lord hath told us that "without him we can do nothing; yea,
   that all our sufficiency is of God, and without him we cannot think a
   good thought; that he works in us to will and to do, -- not only
   beginning, but perfecting every good work, fulfilling in us all the
   good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power;"
   ascribing the whole of the great work of salvation to himself and his
   Holy Spirit, working freely and graciously as he wills and pleaseth. Of
   this order of his dealing with men, that his first or preventing grace
   should be free, but his subsequent grace procured by us and bestowed on
   us according to our working and co-operation with his first grace,
   invented by Pelagius, Julianus, and Celestinus, and here introduced
   anew by Mr Goodwin, he informs us nothing at all. In brief, this whole
   discourse is the mere Pelagian figment, wrapped up in general, cloudy
   expressions, with allusions to some Scripture phrases (which profane as
   well as erring spirits are prone to) concerning the bestowing of the
   grace of God according to the differing deportments and deservings of
   men, differencing themselves from others, and, in comparison of them,
   holding out what they have not received. But, --

   2. "To answer the first and gentle motions of the Spirit is to be led
   by him, and then we shall be filled with the Spirit." But how doth Mr
   Goodwin prove that to be "led by the Spirit" is to "answer his first
   gentle motions," and thereby to obtain his farther and more glorious
   actings and persuasions? Is it safe thus to make bold with the word of
   God? or is not this to wrest it, as ignorant and unstable men do, unto
   perdition? Saints being "led by the Spirit of God," and "walking after
   the Spirit," are, in Rom. viii., expressions of that effectual
   sanctification, exerting itself in their conversation and walking with
   God, which the Spirit of God worketh in them, and which it is their
   duty to come up unto, in opposition to "living or walking after the
   flesh." If this now be attained, and the saints come up unto it,
   antecedently to the subsequent grace of the Spirit, what is that
   subsequent grace which is so gloriously expressed, and wherein doth it
   consist? Neither doth that expression of "Led by the Spirit" hold out
   the concurrence or "comportment" of their wills, as it is phrased, with
   the gentle motion of the Spirit, but the powerful and effectual
   operation of the Spirit, as to their holiness and walking with God.
   Pneumati Theou agontai is not, "They comport or concur with the Spirit
   in his motions;" but, "By the Spirit they are acted and carried out to
   the things of God." Neither hath this any relation to or coherence with
   that of the Eph. v. 18, "Be filled with the Spirit." Neither is there
   any such intendment in the expression as is here intimated, of a
   promise of receiving more of the Spirit, on condition of that
   compliance, concurrence, and comportance with his motions, as is
   intimated. That the Spirit is sometimes taken for his graces, sometimes
   for his gifts habitually, sometimes for his actual operations, is
   known. The apostle in that place, dissuading the Ephesians from turning
   aside to such carnal, sinful refreshments as men of the world went out
   unto, bids them "not be drunk with wine, wherein is excess," but to be
   "filled with the Spirit;" to take their refreshment in the joys of the
   Spirit, "speaking to themselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
   songs," verses 18, 19. Could I once imagine that Mr Goodwin had the
   least thought that indeed there was any thing in the Scripture looking
   towards his intendment in the producing of it, I should farther
   manifest the mistake thereof. To play thus with the word of God is a
   liberty we dare not make use of yet.

   3. He concludes, "That the reason why believers are overcome by the
   lustings of the flesh is, not because the Spirit is not stronger than
   the flesh, but because men have more will to hearken to the lusts of
   the flesh than to the Spirit."


   "Fortunam Priami cantabo, et nobile bellum."

   This is the issue of all the former swelling discourse: "Men's sins are
   from their own wills, and not because the Spirit is not stronger than
   the flesh." And who ever doubted it? The conclusion you were to prove
   is, "That believers sin with their whole will and full consent of their
   wills, and that the new principle that is in them doth not cause their
   wills to decline from acting in sin to the just efficacy of all their
   strength and vigour." But of this oude gru. For the insinuation in that
   expression of the "will hearkening to the lusting of the flesh, and not
   to the lusting of the Spirit," in a sovereign indifferency to both, and
   a liberty for the performance of either, in a way exclusive of good or
   vicious habitual principles of operation in the will itself, I shall
   not now divert to the consideration of.

   What else remains in this section either doth not concern the business
   in hand, as the fine notion of the Spirit's return to move believers,
   when his motions have been rejected, with the manner thereof, according
   to his conception, must be afterward considered apart, -- as the fall
   of David into adultery and murder, if there be need to go forth to the
   consideration of his examples and instances; and therefore I shall not
   longer insist upon it. Only, the close of it, consisting of an
   inference made from some words of Peter Martyr, deserves consideration.
   "Upon David's sin," saith he, "Peter Martyr makes this observation,
   That the saints themselves, being once fallen into sin, would always
   remain in the pollution of it, did not God by his mighty word bring
   them out of it: which saying of Martyr clearly also implies that the
   saints many times sin with their whole wills and full consents;
   because, were any part of their wills bent against the committing of
   the sin at the time when it is committed, they would questionless
   return to themselves and repent immediately after, the heat and
   violence of the lust being over, by reason of the satisfaction that
   hath been given thereunto."

   Ans. The close insinuation in Peter Martyr's words, of the saints
   sinning with their whole wills, and the logic of Mr Goodwin's inference
   from them, I believe is very much hidden from the reader. To the
   theology of it, I say that the saints, para to pleiston, do immediately
   return to God by repentance, as Peter did, upon their surprisals into
   sin; nor have they any rest in a condition of the eclipse of the
   countenance of God from them, as upon sin it is always, more or less.
   Of David's particular case mention may afterward be made. But the
   proof, "that they sin with their whole wills and full consent, because
   they would continue in sin did not the Lord relieve and deliver them by
   his word and grace," is admirable. I would adventure to cast this
   argument into as many shapes as it is tolerably capable of, had I the
   least hope to cause it to appear any way argumentative. We deny, then,
   that believers have any such power habitually residing in them as
   whereby, without any new supplies of the Spirit or concurrence of
   actual grace, they can effectually and eventually recover themselves
   from any sin whatever; which supplies of the Spirit and grace we say,
   and have proved, are freely promised to them in the covenant of grace.
   But what will hence follow to the supportment of Mr Goodwin's
   hypothesis, "That therefore in all their sins, or any of their sins,
   they sin with the full and whole consent of their wills," I suppose he
   alone knows.

   Sect. 26, he endeavours to take off that of the apostle, Rom. vii.
   19-22, from appearing against him in this cause of the saints' sinning
   with their whole wills and consents, not not-willing the things they
   do. To this end he tells us, "That when the apostle saith, The evil
   which I would not, that I do,' his meaning is, not that he did that
   which, at the same time that he did it, he was not willing either in
   whole or in part to do, but that he sometimes did that, upon a
   surprisal by temptation or through incogitancy, which he was not
   habitually willing or disposed in the inward man to do; but this no
   ways implies but that, at the time when he did the evil he speaks of,
   he did it with the full and entire consent of his will."

   Ans. 1. It is probable the apostle knew his own meaning, and also how
   to express it, having so good a Teacher to that end and purpose as he
   had. Now he assures us, in the person of a regenerate man, that as what
   he would he did not, so what he did he would not, he hated it; and
   again, he did that which he would not, and therein consented to the
   law, by his not-willing of that he did, that it was good, verses 15,
   16: which, whether it express not a renitency of the will to that which
   was done in part, and so far as to make the action itself remiss, and
   not to enwrap the whole consent of the will, he farther declares, verse
   17, telling us that there is a perfect, unconsenting "I," or internal
   principle, in the very doing of evil: "It is no more I that do it, but
   sin that dwelleth in me."

   2. The apostle doth not say what he was not habitually willing to, but
   what he was habitually unwilling to, -- that is, what the bent of his
   will lay habitually against, having actual inclinations and elicit acts
   always to the contrary, though sometimes overcome. Neither in his
   discoursing of it cloth he mention at all the surprisal into sin upon
   incogitancy and inadvertency, but the constant frame and temper of a
   regenerate man upon the powerful acting and striving of the principle
   of lust and sin dwelling in him and remaining with him; which, saith
   the apostle, doth often carry him out to do those things which are
   contrary to the principle of the inward man, which habitually condemns
   and actually not-wills, or rather hills, the things that are so done,
   even in their doing. And this doth manifest sufficiently, that when he
   did the evil he speaks of, he did it not with the full and entire
   consent of his will, as men do in whom there is no such principle
   opposite to sin and sinning as is in him that is regenerate, there
   being very much taken off by the habitual principle of grace that is in
   him, and its constant inclination to the contrary.

   But he farther argues, "If we shall affirm that the contrary bent or
   motion of his will at other times is a sufficient proof that when he
   did the evil we speak of, he did it not with his whole will or fulness
   of consent, and so make this doing of evil or committing of sin without
   fullness of consent, in such a sense, a distinguishing character
   betwixt men regenerate and unregenerate, we shall bring Herod and
   Pilate, and probably Judas himself, into the list of men regenerate,
   with a thousand more whom the Scripture knows not under any such name
   or relation, -- namely, all those whose judgments and consciences stand
   against the evil of the ways and practices wherein they walk."

   And this he proves at large to the end of the section, in the instance
   of Herod and Pilate proceeding, against their own judgments and
   consciences, in the killing of John and of our Saviour.

   Ans. 1. We do not only assert a contrary bent and inclination in the
   wills of believers at other times, but also that, in and under the
   prevalency of indwelling sin, there is in them an "I" that cloth it
   not, and a not-willing it, from a principle, though, by reason of the
   present prevalency of the other, its actings and stirrings are not so
   sensibly perceived; so that though they prevail not to the total
   prevention of the will from exerting the act of sin, yet they prevail
   to the impairing, weakening, and making remiss its consent thereunto.

   2. The residue of this paragraph is intolerably sophistical,
   confounding the renitency of the inward man, the principle of grace
   that is in the wills of believers, with the convictions of the
   judgments and consciences of unregenerate persons, and their striving
   against sin on that account. The judgments and consciences of wicked
   men tell them what they ought to do and what they ought not to do,
   without respect to the principle in their wills that is predominant;
   but the apostle mentions the actings of the will itself from his own
   regenerate principle. We wholly deny that any unregenerate man hath any
   vital principle in his will not-consenting to sin, whatever the
   dictates of his judgment and conscience may be, or how effectual soever
   to prevail unto an abstinence from sin. To discover the differences
   that are between the contest that is between the wills in unregenerate
   men, wholly set upon sin on the one hand, and their judgments and
   consciences, enlightened to an apprehension and approving of better
   things on the other, and the contest that is between the flesh and
   Spirit lusting to contrary things in the same will, as it is in
   regenerate men, is a common-place that I shall not go forth unto. We
   grant, then, that in unregenerate men there may be, there is, and was
   in some degree perhaps in Herod and in Pilate, a conviction of
   conscience and judgment that the things they do are evil; but we say
   withal, that all this being foreign to their wills, it hinders not but
   that they sin with the full, uncontrolled consent of their wills, which
   are at perfect liberty, or rather in perfect bondage, unto sin. That
   the "Spirit should lust against the flesh, and the flesh against the
   Spirit," both in the same will (as it appears they do, Gal. v. 19-23,
   for the fruits that they both bring forth are acts of the will), in any
   unregenerate man, we deny. And this is that, and not the former, which
   abates and takes off from the will's consent to sin.

   He concludes the whole: "And to the passage of the apostle, mentioned
   Rom. vii., I answer farther, that when he saith, The evil which I would
   not, that do I,' he doth not speak of what he always and in all cases
   did, much less of what was possible for him to do, but of what he did
   ordinarily and frequently, or of what was very incident unto him,
   through the infirmity of the flesh, namely, through inconsiderateness
   and anticipation by temptations to do such things which, when he was in
   a watchful and considerate posture and from under the malignant
   influence of a temptation, he was altogether averse unto. Now, what a
   man doth ordinarily is one thing, and what he doth sometimes and in
   some particular cases, especially what it is possible for him to do, is
   another. That true believers, whilst such, ordinarily sin not upon
   worse terms than those mentioned by the apostle concerning his sinning,
   I easily grant; but it no ways followeth from hence, that therefore
   they never sin upon other terms, much less that it is impossible that
   they should sin upon others. And thus we see, all things thoroughly and
   impartially argued, and debated to and fro, that even true believers
   themselves, as well as others, may do those works of the flesh which
   exclude from the kingdom of God, and that in respect thereof they are
   subject to this exclusion as well as other men."

   1. The sum of this part of the reply is, That what Paul speaks is true
   of the ordinary course of believers, but not of extraordinary
   surprisals. This seems, I say, to be the tendency of it, though the
   direct sense of the whole is not so obvious to me. By that expression,
   "The evil that I would not, that I do," you intend either the
   expression of "he would not," or "he did." If the latter, then you say
   he did not sin ordinarily and frequently, but only upon surprisals;
   which is freely granted, but it is not at all to your purpose, but
   rather much against it. If you intend that part of it which holds out
   his renitency against the evil he did, in the expression of "I would
   not," then you say it was not ordinary with the apostle to hill the
   evil that he did, but in case of surprisal to sin: which I believe is
   not intended; for is it credible that any one should think that, in the
   ordinary course of a man's walking, there should be no opposition made
   to sin, [the] falling whereinto men are liable [unto], but upon
   "surprisals and anticipations by temptation," as it is phrased there
   should? Igor is it [credible], on the other side, that he intends the
   thing that he did ordinarily, but [when he] was surprised by temptation
   then it might be otherwise. But, first, is a saint to be supposed to
   sin ordinarily, to sin not prevailed on by temptation? Is not all sin
   from temptation? Do they sin actually, but upon surprisal of
   temptation? To impose this upon the apostle, that he should say,
   "Truly, for the most part, or in my ordinary walking, I do not sin, but
   withal I will it not; but when I am surprised with temptations then it
   is otherwise with me, there is no renitency in my will to sin," is
   doubtless to wrong him. He doth not limit his not-willing of the evil
   he did to any consideration whatever, but speaks of it generally, as
   the constant state and condition of things with him.

   2. In the beginning of this section, the nilling of sin was antecedent
   to the sin; here it is something that may be allowed in ordinary cases,
   but not at all in extraordinary. So that these two expositions put
   together amount to thus much: "Ordinarily the apostle, antecedent to
   any sinning, before the lusting of the Spirit ceased, did not-will the
   thing that he did, which was evil; but in case of temptation it was not
   so;" -- that is, antecedently to his acting of that which was evil, he
   had no opposition in the inward man unto it, nor lusting of the Spirit
   against it; which how it can be made good against him whose heart is
   upright and who hates every evil way, I know not.

   3. It is confessed that "ordinarily believers sin at no worse a rate
   than that expressed by the apostle." But what doth that contain? If
   "would not" be referred to their doing of sins, then you grant that
   which all this while you have endeavoured to oppose, and are reconciled
   to your own "contradiction of the first evidence," -- sin cannot,
   ordinarily or extraordinarily, be committed but by an act of the will,
   and yet ordinarily there is a dissent of the will also thereunto. If
   you adhere to your other former interpretation, that the willing
   against sin committed is antecedent to the commitment of it, and laid
   asleep before the perpetration of any sin, then this also is imposed on
   you, that there are sins whereunto they may be surprised by temptations
   that, antecedently to the commitment of them, they do not not-will, --
   that as to them "the Spirit lusteth not against the flesh;" which is
   notoriously false, for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and all the
   ways of it and all the fruits thereof, and the Spirit lusteth against
   the flesh with all its ways and fruits.

   4. It appears, then, this being the description of a regenerate man
   which the apostle gives, as to indwelling sin and all the fruits
   thereof, that it is most ridiculous to exempt his frame, in respect of
   such sins as he may fall into by surprisals of temptations, from this
   description of him, and so to frame this distinction to the apostle's
   general rule, that it holds in eases ordinary, but not in
   extraordinary, when nothing in the whole context gives the least
   allowance or countenance to such a limitation.

   It appears, then, notwithstanding any thing offered here to the
   contrary, upon due consideration of it, that believers sin not with
   their whole wills and full consents at any time, nor under the power of
   what temptation soever they may fall for a season; and that because of
   the residence of this principle of a contrary tendency unto sin in
   their wills, which is always acting, either directly in inclining unto
   good, or in taking off or making remiss the consent of the will to sin,
   notwithstanding the prevalency of the principle opposite thereunto by
   its committing of sin.

   And hence have we sufficient light for the weakening of the argument
   proposed in the beginning of this chapter; for though it is weak in its
   foundation (as shall be showed), concluding to what the saints may do
   from what is forbidden them to do, that prohibition being the ordinance
   of God certainly to preserve them from it, yet taking it for granted
   that they may fall into the sin intimated, yet seeing they do it not
   customarily, not maliciously, not with the full and whole consent of
   their wills, that there is a principle in them still opposing sin,
   though at any time weakened by sin, the conclusion of that argument
   concerns them not. I say, then, first, to the major proposition, They
   who are in a capacity and possibility (that is, a universal
   possibility, not only in respect of an internal principle, but of all
   outward prohibiting causes, as the purpose and promise of God) of
   perpetrating the works of the flesh (not of bringing forth any fruits
   of the lusting of the flesh, which are in the best) willingly and
   ordinarily with the full and whole consent of their wills (in which
   sense alone such works of the flesh are absolutely exclusive from the
   kingdom of heaven), they may possibly fall out of the favour of God and
   into destruction. This proposition being thus limited, and the terms of
   it cleared, for to cause it to pass, I absolutely deny the minor, That
   true believers do or can so sin (that is, so bring forth the works of
   the flesh) as to leave no room for the continuance of mercy to them,
   according to the tenor of the covenant of grace.

   But now frame the proposition so as the assumption may comprise
   believers, and we shall quickly know what to judge of it: "Those who
   are in a capacity or possibility of falling into such sins as deserve
   rejection from God, or of perpetrating works of the flesh, though they
   do so overborne by the power of temptation, nilling the things they do,
   not abiding in their sins, may fall totally and finally from God; but
   believers may so do." As the matter is thus stated, the assumption may
   be allowed to pass upon believers, but we absolutely deny the major
   proposition in the sense wherein it is urged. I shall only add, that
   when we deny that believers can possibly fall away, it is not an
   absolute impossibility we intend, nor an impossibility with respect to
   any principle in them only that in and from itself is not perishable,
   nor an impossibility in respect of the manner of their acting, but such
   an one as, principally respecting the outward removing cause of such an
   actual defection, will infallibly prevent the event of it. And thus is
   the cloud raked by this fifth argument dispelled and scattered by the
   light of the very first consideration of the difference in sinning, --
   that is, between regenerate and unregenerate men; so that it will be an
   easy thing to remove and take away what afterward is insisted on for
   the re-enforcement and confirmation of the several propositions of it.

   The major proposition he confirms from Gal. v. 21, Eph. v. 5, 6, 1 Cor.
   vi. 9, 10, all affirming that neither whoremongers, nor adulterers, nor
   idolaters, nor the like, have any inheritance in the kingdom of God, or
   can be saved. That the intendment of the apostle is concerning them who
   live in a course of such sins, who sin with their whole wills and from
   an evil root, with whose sap they are wholly leavened and tainted
   throughout, not them who, through the strength of temptation and the
   surprisals of it, not without the renitency in their wills unto all
   sin, any sin, the sin wherewith they are overtaken, may possibly fall
   into any such sin (as did David and Peter), was before declared; and in
   that sense we grant the proposition.

   For the proof of the minor proposition, -- which should be, That
   believers may perpetrate the works of the flesh in the sense intended
   in the places of Scripture before mentioned, -- he insists on two
   things: first, The direction of those scriptures unto believers;
   secondly, The experience of the ways of such persons, -- that is, of
   believers. The apostle tells believers that they who commit such and
   such things, with such and such circumstances in their commitment,
   cannot be saved; therefore believers may commit those sins in the
   manner intended! What hath been said before of the use of threatenings
   and denunciations of judgments on impenitent sinners in respect of
   believers, will give a sufficient account (if there be need of any) for
   our denial of this consequence. And for the second, that the experience
   of such men's ways and walking evinceth it, it is a plain begging of
   the thing under debate, and an assuming of that which was proposed to
   be proved, -- a thing unjustly charged by him on his adversaries, as
   though they should confess that believers might sin to the extent of
   the lines drawn out in the places of Scripture mentioned and yet not
   lose their faith, when, because they cannot lose their faith, they deny
   that they can sin to that compass of excess and riot intimated.

   I cannot see, then, to what end and purpose the whole ensuing
   discourse, from the beginning of this argument to the end of the 21st
   section, is. It is acknowledged that all those places do concern
   believers, the intendment of the Holy Ghost in them being to discover
   to them the nature of the sins specified, and the end of the committing
   of them in the way intended, and that God purposes to proceed according
   to the importance of what is threatened to those sins so committed with
   all that do them; that so they may walk watchfully and carefully,
   avoiding not only those things themselves, but all the ways and means
   leading to them (though if any one of them sin any of those sins
   without the deadly attendants of them mentioned in Scripture, they have
   an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous). But that from
   thence it may be inferred that believers may, and some do sin, and that
   God intends, as it is expressed, to destroy them if they so do, when he
   hath promised they shall never do so, is a very weak and ridiculous
   argumentation. They are a medium of acquainting them with the desert of
   sin, the terror of the law to them that are under it, and the riches of
   grace in their deliverance.

   It is true, "unbelievers are," as you say, "in our judgment" (and I
   wonder what yours is in the case), "in a state of exclusion from the
   kingdom of God, whether they perpetrate the works of the flesh
   mentioned or no." Unbelief is, in our judgment, sufficient of itself to
   exclude any one from the kingdom of God. But yet withal, in our
   judgment (and we desire to know yours), it is impossible that
   unbelievers (we mean those who are adults) should not perpetrate the
   same evils mentioned, or others of the same import, "all the thoughts
   and imaginations of their hearts being evil, and that continually," and
   thereupon be farther exposed to the wrath of God, which is revealed
   against all that do evil. If, therefore, the discovery of a man's
   desperate condition, that he may be stirred up to labour and strive for
   a deliverance from it, doth concern him, then these and the like
   passages do properly and primarily concern unbelievers, whose state,
   with the issue of it, is particularly described therein. And to say, as
   our author doth, "that it is a vain thing for the Spirit of God to
   threaten wrath to men upon the committing of sin, if by unbelief they
   are exposed antecedently to that wrath," is to question the wisdom of
   Him with whom (whatever become of us poor worms) we cannot contend. He
   hath told us that all men by nature are children of wrath and unclean,
   so far as not to be able to enter into the kingdom of heaven unless
   they be washed and born again; and yet (we hope without the least
   deficiency in wisdom), hath farther revealed his wrath from heaven
   against the ensuing ungodliness that is committed by these children of
   wrath, to be executed in tribulation and anguish against every soul
   that so doth evil. Not to detain the reader; what hath been said and
   shall farther be argued concerning the difference that is between
   believers and unbelievers in their sinning, with that also which hath
   been spoken of the concernment of believers in these and the like
   passages of Scripture, sufficiently argues that no such inference as is
   made for the confirmation of the assumption of the argument under
   consideration, according to Mr Goodwin's thoughts and apprehensions of
   it, can possibly be drawn out from them.

   Sect. 22 is a pretty pageant, and by the reader's favour I shall show
   it him once more: "If it be objected, That true believers have a
   promise from God that they shall never lose their faith,' I answer, --
   First, That this hath oft been said, but never so much as once proved.
   Secondly, Upon examination of those scriptures wherein such promises of
   God are pretended to reside or to be found, we find no such thing in
   them. We find, indeed, many promises of their perseverance, but all of
   them conditional, and such whose performance, in respect of actual and
   complete perseverance, is suspended upon the diligent and careful use
   of means by men to persevere. And, lastly, to affirm that true
   believers can by no commission of sin or sins whatsoever, how
   frequently soever reiterated, how long continued in soever, ever make
   shipwreck of their faith, or fall away from the grace and favour of God
   so as to perish, what is it but to provoke the flesh to an
   outrageousness in sinning, and to encourage that which remains of the
   old man in them to bestir itself in all ways of unrighteousness? And,
   doubtless, the teaching of that doctrine hath been the casting of a
   snare upon the world, and hath caused many whose feet God had guided
   into ways of peace to adventure so far into desperateness of sinning,
   that, through the just judgment of God, their hearts never served them
   to return."

   Ans. 1. The foundation of this whole discourse is a supposal of
   promises of preserving believers in their faith, upon the ridiculous
   supposition after mentioned, to be asserted by the doctrine of the
   saints' perseverance and the defenders of it; which Mr Goodwin knows
   full well to be far otherwise.

   2. It hath sufficiently been proved that believers have a promise, yea,
   many promises, to be kept by the power of God from all and any such
   sin, or any such circumstance of sin, or continuance in sin, as is
   wholly inconsistent with believing; and that therefore they shall be
   preserved in believing.

   3. Upon our calling the examination of the proofs of this assertion to
   an account, we have found it to be made up of trivial exceptions and
   sophistical suppositions, confident beggings and cravings of the things
   under contest and debate (all the endeavours to prove the promises of
   perseverance to be conditional having also involved in them an absolute
   contradiction to the truth and to themselves), no way sufficient to
   evince that the promises and work of God's grace are suspended upon any
   conditions in men whatsoever. And, --

   4. We say that the intrusion of this vain hypothesis, that believers
   should continue so under the consideration here intimated by you of
   sin, when the main of the doctrine contended for consists in a full and
   plain denial that they can or shall fall under it (according to the
   import of 1 John iii. 9, immediately to be insisted on), being
   preserved by the Spirit and grace of him who so writes his law in their
   hearts that they shall never depart from him, is the great engine you
   have used in all your attempts against it, being indeed a mere begging
   of the thing in question.

   5. That there is nothing in this doctrine in the least suited to turn
   aside the saints of God from the holy commandment, but that, on the
   contrary, it is of an excellent usefulness and effectual influence for
   the promotion of all manner of godliness in those that are truly
   saints, howsoever any man may abuse it (as any other discovery of the
   grace of God), turning it into lasciviousness, hath been declared. What
   use hath been made of the contrary doctrine in the world we have
   hitherto had experience only in the Pelagians, Papists, Socinians, and
   Arminians; and with what fruits of it they have abounded the church of
   God doth partly know. What it is like to bring forth, being now
   translated into another soil, or rather having won over to it men some
   time of another profession, is yet somewhat, though not altogether, in
   abeyance.

   Let us, then, with the apostle, having proceeded thus far with Mr
   Goodwin, that a foundation may be the better laid for the removal of
   what he farther adds, proceed to consider the progress of sin, and to
   remark from thence the difference that is between regenerate and
   unregenerate men in their sinning.

   The second thing proposed in the apostle's discourse of the rise and
   progress of sin, is the general way that lust proceedeth in for the
   bringing of it forth, and that is temptation: "Every man is tempted of
   his own lust." This is the general way that lust proceeds in for the
   production of actual sin; it tempts, and he in whom it is is tempted,
   There is a temptation unto sin only, and a temptation unto sin by sin.
   The first is no sin in him that is so tempted. Our Saviour was so
   tempted: "He was tempted of the devil," Matt. iv. 1; "He was in all
   points tempted like as we are, yet without sin," Heb. iv. 15. That his
   temptations were unto sin is apparent from the story of them. But "the
   prince of this world coming had nothing in him," John xiv. 30, -- found
   nothing in him to answer and close with his temptations; and therefore,
   though he was tempted, yet was he without sin. Now, though this sort of
   temptations from Satan is not originally our sins but his, yet there
   being tinder in our souls that kindles more or less in and upon every
   injection of his fiery darts, there being something in us to meet many,
   if not all, of his temptations, they prove, in some measure, in the
   issue to be ours. Indeed, Satan sometimes ventures upon us in things
   wherein he hath, doubtless, small hope of any concurrence, and so seems
   rather to aim at our disquiet than our sins; as in those whom he
   perplexes with hard and blasphemous thoughts of God, -- a thing so
   contradictory to the very principles, not of grace only, but of that
   whereby we are men, that it is utterly impossible there should be any
   assent of the soul thereunto. To think of God as God is to think of him
   every thing that is good, pure, great, excellent, incomprehensible, in
   all perfection. Now, at the same time, to have any apprehensions of a
   direct contradictory importance, the mind of man is not capable. Were
   it not for the unbelief, causeless fears, and discontentments that in
   many do ensue upon temptations of this nature, -- which are consequents
   and not effects of it, -- Satan might keep this dart in his own forge
   for any mischief he is like to do with it. The apostle speaks here of
   temptations by sin as well as unto sin; and these former are men's sins
   as well as their temptations. They are temptations, as tending to
   farther evil; they are sins, as being irregular and devious from the
   rule. Now, this tempting of lust compriseth two things:--

   1. The general active inclination of the heart unto sin, though not
   fixed as unto any particular act or way of sin, the "motus primo
   primi." Of this you have that testimony of God concerning man in the
   state of nature, Gen. vi. 5, "Every figment of the thoughts of his
   heart is only evil every day." The figment or imagination of the
   thoughts is the very root of them, the general moulding or active
   preparing of the mind for the exerting of them. So 1 Chron. xxviii. 9,
   "The Lord understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts;" -- the
   figments of them, the next disposition of the soul unto them; and chap.
   xxix. 18, "Keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of
   their hearts," or keep their hearts in a continual framing posture and
   condition of such good thoughts. This, I say, is the first way of
   lust's temptation; it makes a mint of the heart, to frame readily all
   manner of evil desires and thoughts, that they may, as our Saviour
   speaks, "proceed out of the heart," Matt. xv. 19. Their actual fixing
   on any object is their proceeding, antecedent whereunto they are framed
   and formed in the heart. Lust actually disposeth, inclines, bends the
   heart to things suitable to itself, or the corrupt, habitual principle
   which hath its residence in us.

   2. The actual tumultuating of lust, and working with all its power and
   policy, in stirring up, provoking to, and drawing out, thoughts and
   contrivances of sin, with delight and complacency, in inconceivable
   variety; the several degrees of its progress herein being afterward
   described.

   In the first of these there is no small difference between regenerate
   and unregenerate persons, and that in these two things:--

   1. In its universality. In unregenerate men "every figment of their
   heart is only evil, and that every day." There is a universality of
   actings expressed positively, and exclusively to any actings of another
   kind, "Every figment of their heart is only evil;" and of time, "Every
   day." Whatever good they seem to do, or do, whatever duties they
   perform, that in them all which is the proper figment of their heart is
   only evil. On this account, take any duty they do, any work they
   perform, and weigh it in the balance, and it will be found, in respect
   of principles, or circumstances, or aims, to be wholly evil, -- that
   indeed there is nothing in it that is acceptable to God; and their
   hearts are casting, minting, and coining sin all the day long. With
   believers it is not so; there is also a good treasure in their hearts,
   from whence they bring out good things. There is a good root in them,
   that bears good fruit. Though they are, or may be, overtaken with many
   sins, yea with great sins, yet lust doth not tempt them, as it doth
   unregenerate men, with a perpetual, continual, active inclination unto
   evil, even, some way or other, in all the good they do. The Spirit is
   in them, and will and doth, in what state soever they are, dispose
   their hearts to faith, love, meekness, and actuates those graces, at
   least in the elicit acts of the will; for "a good tree will bring forth
   good fruit." Never any believer is or was so deserted of God, or did so
   forsake God, as that "every figment of his heart should be only evil,
   and that continually." That no one act of sin can possibly expel his
   habit of grace hath been formerly showed: neither is he ever cast into
   such a condition but, from the good principle that is in him, there is
   a panting after God, a longing for his salvation, with more or less
   efficacy; the spark is warm and glowing, though under ashes.

   2. In respect of power. Lust tempts in unregenerate men out of an
   absolute, uncontrollable dominion, and that with a morally irresistible
   efficacy. All its dominion, as hath been showed, and very much of its
   strength, is lost in believers. This is the intendment of the apostle's
   discourse, Rom. vi., concerning the crucifying of sin by the death of
   Christ. The power, strength, vigour, and efficacy of it, is so far
   abated, weakened, mortified, that it cannot so effectually impel unto
   sin as it doth when it is in perfect life and strength.

   But you will say, then, "If lust be thus weakened in believers more
   than in others, how comes it to pass that they do at any time fall into
   such great and heinous sins as sometimes they do, and have done? Will
   not this argue them to be even worse than unregenerate persons, seeing
   they fall into sin upon easier terms, and with less violence of impulse
   from indwelling sin, than they?"

   Ans. 1. The examples of believers falling into great sins are rare, and
   such as by no means are to be accommodated to their state in their
   ordinary walking with God. It is true, there are examples of such falls
   recorded in the Scripture, that they might lie as buoys to all
   generations, to caution men of their danger when the waves of
   temptation arise; to show what is in man, in the best of men; to keep
   all the saints of God humble, self-empty, and in a continual dependence
   on Him in whom are all their springs, from whom are all their supplies:
   but as they are mostly all Old Testament examples, before grace for
   grace was given out by Jesus Christ, so they are by no means farther to
   be urged, nor are, but only to show that it is possible that God can
   keep alive the root when the tree is cut down to the ground, and cause
   it to bud again by the scent of the water of his Spirit flowing towards
   it.

   2. That believers fall not into great sins at any time by the mere
   strength of indwelling sin, unless it be in conjunction with some
   violent outward temptation exceedingly surprising them; either by
   weakening all ways and means whereby the principle of grace should
   exert itself, as in the case of Peter; or by sudden heightening of
   their corruption by some overpowering objects, attended with all
   circumstances of prevalency, not without God's withholding his special
   grace in an eminent manner, for ends best known to himself, as in the
   case of David. Hence it is that, even in such sins, we say they sin out
   of infirmity; that is, not out of prepense deliberation as to sin, not
   out of malice, not out of love to or delight in sin, but merely through
   want of strength, when overborne by the power of temptation.

   This Mr Goodwin frames as an objection to himself, in the pursuit of
   the vindication of the argument under consideration, sect. 23:--

   "Others plead, That there is no reason to conceive that true believers,
   though they perpetrate the works of the flesh, should be excluded from
   the kingdom of heaven upon this account; because when they sin in this
   kind, they sin out of infirmity, and not out of malice.'?"

   Ans. I was not to choose what objections Mr Goodwin should answer, nor
   had the framing of them which he chose to deal withal, and therefore
   must be contented with them as he is pleased to afford them to us;
   only, if I may be allowed to speak in this case, -- and I know I have
   the consent of many concerned in it, -- I should somewhat otherwise
   frame this objection or answer, being partly persuaded that Mr Goodwin
   did not find it, but framed it himself into the shape wherein it here
   appears. I say, then, that the saints of God sin out of infirmity only,
   not maliciously, nor deditâ operâ, in cool blood, nor with their whole
   hearts, but purely upon the account of the weakness of their graces,
   being overpowered by the strength of temptation; and therefore cannot
   so perpetrate the works of the flesh and in such a way as must,
   according to the tenor of the covenant wherein they walk with God, not
   only deserve rejection and damnation, but also be absolutely and
   indispensably exclusive of them from the kingdom of God. What Mr
   Goodwin hath drawn forth to take off in any measure the truth of this
   assertion shall be considered. He says, then, --

   "To say that true believers, or any other men, do perpetrate the works
   of the flesh out of infirmity involves a contradiction; for to do the
   works of the flesh implies the dominion of the flesh in the doers of
   them, which in sins of infirmity hath no place. The apostle clearly
   intimates the nature of sins of infirmity in that to the Galatians,
   Beloved, if any man be overtaken with a fault' (prolephthe), -- be
   prevented, or taken at unawares.' When a man's foot is taken in the
   snare of a temptation, only through a defect of that spiritual
   watchfulness over himself and his ways which he ought to keep
   constantly, and so sinneth, contrary to the habitual and standing frame
   of his heart, this man sinneth out of infirmity; but he that thus
   sinneth cannot, in Scripture phrase, be said either to walk or to live
   according to the flesh, or to do the works of the flesh, or to do the
   lusts or desires of the flesh, because none of these are anywhere
   ascribed unto or charged upon true believers, but only upon such
   persons who are enemies unto God and children of wrath."

   Ans. This being the substance of all that is spoken to the business in
   hand, I have transcribed it at large, that with its answer it may at
   once lie under the reader's view. I say, then, --

   1. We give this reason that "believers cannot perpetrate the works of
   the flesh" in the sense contended about, because they sin out of
   infirmity; and do not say that they so "perpetrate the works of the
   flesh out of infirmity." But if by "perpetrating the works of the
   flesh" you intend only the bringing forth at any time, or under any
   temptation whatsoever, any fruits of the flesh, such as every sin is,
   that this may not be done out of infirmity, or that it involves a
   contradiction to say so, is indeed not to know what you say, to
   contradict yourself, and to deny that there be any sins of infirmity at
   all, which that there are you granted in the words foregoing, and
   describe the nature of it in the words following. They, doubtless, in
   whom the flesh always lusteth against the Spirit are sometimes led away
   and enticed by their own lusts, so as to bring forth the fruits of it.

   2. If "to do the works of the flesh" imports with you, as indeed in
   itself it doth, the predominancy and dominion of the flesh in them that
   do the works thereof, we wholly deny that believers can so do the works
   of the flesh; as upon other reasons, so partly because they sin out of
   infirmity, which sufficiently argues that the flesh hath not the
   dominion in them, for then they should not through infirmity be
   captivated to it, but should willingly "yield up their members as
   instruments of unrighteousness unto sin."

   3. The description you give of a sin of infirmity, from Gal. vi. 1, is
   that alone which we acknowledge may befall believers, though it hath
   sometimes befallen them in greater sins. It is evident from hence that
   a sin becometh a sin of infirmity, not from the nature of it, but from
   the manner of men's falling into it. The greatest actual sin may be a
   sin of infirmity, and the least a sin of presumption. It is possible a
   believer may be overtaken, or rather surprised, with any sin, so he be
   overtaken or surprised. A surprisal into sin through the power of
   temptation, subtlety of Satan, strength of indwelling sin, contrary to
   the habitual, standing frame of the heart (not always neither through a
   defect of watchfulness), is all that we grant a believer may be liable
   to; and so, upon Mr Goodwin's confession, he sins only out of
   infirmity, such sins being not exclusive of the love and favour of God.
   And, therefore, --

   4. We say that true believers cannot be said to "walk according to the
   flesh," to "do the works of the flesh," to "do the lusts and desires of
   the flesh," which the Holy Ghost so cautions them against; which, as Mr
   Goodwin observes, are "none of them charged upon true believers, but
   only upon such persons as are enemies of God and children of wrath." So
   that those expressions hold out to believers only what they ought to
   avoid, in the use of the means which God graciously affords them, and
   do not discover any thing of the will of God, that he will suffer them,
   contrary to his many faithful promises, to fall into them. And so the
   close of this discourse is contrary to the beginning, Mr Goodwin
   granting that true believers cannot fall into these sins, but only such
   as are enemies to God; and yet he hath no way to prove that true
   believers may cease to be so but because they may fall into these sins,
   which that they may do he here eminently denies. Wherefore he adds:--

   "If by sinning out of malice' they mean sinning with deliberation, with
   plotting and contriving the methods and means of their sinning, --
   sinning against judgment, against the dictates of conscience (and what
   they should mean by sinning out of malice but sinning upon such terms
   as these I understand not), -- certain it is that true believers may so
   sin out of malice, or at least such as were true believers before such
   sinning; and this our adversaries themselves confess."

   Ans. All this falls heavy on the shoulders (as it is supposed) of poor
   David, and yet we think it evident that God "took not his Holy Spirit
   from him," but that his covenant continued with him, "ordered in all
   things and sure," and that "sin had not dominion over him." The reasons
   of this persuasion of ours concerning him shall farther be insisted on
   when we come to the consideration of his case in particular. In the
   meantime, I confess the dreadful falls of some of the saints of God are
   rather to be bewailed than aggravated, and the riches of God's grace in
   their recovery rather to be admired than searched into. Yet we say, --

   1. That no one believer whatever in the world, upon any temptation
   whatever, did fall into any sin of malice; that is, accompanied with
   any hatred of God, or despite of his grace, or whole delight of his
   will in the sin whereunto he was by temptation for a season captivated.
   And though they may fall into sin against their judgments and dictates
   of their consciences, -- as every sin whatever that they have, or may
   have, knowledge of or acquaintance with in their own hearts and ways
   is, -- yet this cloth not make them to sin out of malice; for that
   would leave no distinction between sins of infirmity, whereinto men are
   surprised by temptation, and of malice, even sins of infirmity being in
   general and particular directly contrary to the dictates of their
   enlightened, sanctified judgments and consciences.

   2. For "sinning with deliberation, plotting and contriving the methods
   and means of sinning" (the proof whereof, that so they may do, will
   lie, as was before observed, on the instance of David), I say, it being
   the will of God, for ends and purposes known only to his infinite
   wisdom, to give us, as to his fall, his dark side and his sin to the
   full, with the temptation wherewith he was at first surprised, and
   afterward violently hurried into, upon carnal reasonings and
   considerations of the state whereinto he had cast himself, having lost
   his old Friend and Counsellor, as to any shines of his countenance for
   a season, not acquainting us at all with the frame, and working, and
   striving of his spirit in and under that fall, I shall not dare to draw
   his case into a rule. That what he then did a believer now may do,
   judging of his frame in doing of it only by what is expressed; that
   believers may have morosam cogitationem, or deliberation upon some sins
   whereunto they are tempted, upon the strength of indwelling sin, which
   may possibly so overcome and prevail against the workings of grace for
   a season as to set the flesh at liberty to make contrivances to fulfil
   the lusts thereof, -- I say, many have granted, and I shall not (for
   the sake of poor returning souls, whose backslidings God hath promised
   to heal) deny. But yet, I say, all their actings in this kind are but
   like the desperate actings of a man in a fever, who may have some kind
   of contrivance with himself to do mischief (as I have known some
   myself), and aim at opportunities for the accomplishment of it. All the
   faculties of their souls being discomposed, and rendered unserviceable
   to them through their distemper, through the violence of temptation and
   the tumultuating of lusts, the whole new man may be for a season so
   shattered, and his parts laid out of the way as to such a due answering
   one to another that the whole may be serviceable to the work of faith
   (as a disordered army, wherein is all its fundamental strength, as well
   as when it is rallied in battalia, is altogether unserviceable until it
   be reduced to order), that sin may take the opportunity to fill their
   corrupt heart (as far as it is corrupt) with its pleasure and
   desirableness, and so to set the thoughts of it on work to contrive
   means for its accomplishment. [210] Now as, through the goodness of
   their Father, and supplies of grace, which, through the covenant
   thereof, they do receive, this distemper seizeth believers but rarely
   and extraordinarily, so it doth no way prove them to sin with malice,
   or without hatred of and opposition (secret opposition, which may be as
   secret as some inclinations to sin are, -- not known to ourselves) to
   the things they do in and under that condition.

   That which follows in this section being suited to the apprehension of
   some particular men, though of great name and esteem, according to
   their worth and desert in the church of God, as Ursin, Paræus, and the
   rest, about reigning sin, wherein, as I have declared, my thoughts fall
   not in with them, I shall not need to insist any longer upon it.
   Paræus, after all his aggravations of the sins of believers, yet adds
   that they sin not (nor did David) ex contemptu Dei, but through a
   pre-occupation or surprisal of sin; which I believe to be the
   persuasion of far the greatest number of saints in the world, whatever
   Mr Goodwin is pleased to think or say to the contrary. Nor is their
   apprehension weakened by Nathan's charging upon David his "despising of
   the commandment of the Lord" in doing evil, which, as it is virtually
   done in every sin, and in great sins in an eminent manner, so that it
   did amount indeed not only to a consequential, but a formal voluntary
   contempt of God, Mr Goodwin shall never prove. A father often and
   severely chargeth upon his son a despising of his command, when he hath
   been carried out to transgress it, when yet he knows his son honoureth
   and reverenceth him in his heart, and is exceedingly remote from any
   resolved contempt of him.

   The close of all is a concession of the contra-Remonstrants at the
   Hague conference, "That believers might fall into such sins as that the
   church, according to the commandment of Christ, must pronounce that
   they shall no longer abide in her communion, and that they shall have
   no part in the kingdom of Christ;" which being made an argument for the
   apostasy of the saints, I shall consider how it is here improved by Mr
   Goodwin.

   "Certainly," saith he, "their sense was, that true believers may sin
   above the rate of those who sin out of infirmity, inasmuch as there is
   no commandment of Christ that any church of his should eject such
   persons out of their communion who sin out of infirmity only. So that,
   by the confession of our adversaries themselves, even true believers
   may perpetrate such sins which are of a deeper demerit than to be
   numbered amongst sins of infirmity; yea, such sins for which the church
   of Christ, according to the commandment of Christ, stands bound to
   judge them for ever excluded from the kingdom of God, without
   repentance. From whence it undeniably follows that they may commit such
   sins whereby their faith in Christ will be totally lost, because there
   is no condemnation unto those that are by faith in Jesus Christ,
   whether they repent or not: and therefore they that stand in need of
   repentance to give them a right and title to the kingdom of God are no
   sons of God by faith; for were they sons, they would be heirs also, and
   consequently have right and title to the inheritance. So that to
   pretend that howsoever the saints may fall into great and grievous
   sins, yet they shall certainly be renewed again by repentance before
   they die, though this be an assertion without any bottom on reason or
   truth, yet doth it no ways oppose, but suppose rather, a possibility of
   the total defection of faith in true believers."

   Ans. 1. That "true believers may sin above the rate of sins of
   infirmity," because they may so sin as that, according to the
   appointment of Jesus Christ, they may be cast out of a particular
   church, is not attempted to be proved. Doth Mr Goodwin think none may
   be excommunicated but such as have sinned themselves out of the state
   of grace? That a man may, through infirmity, fall into some such sin as
   for it to be amoved from a church society (that amotion being an
   ordinance of Christ for his recovery from that sin), I know not that it
   can be reasonably questioned. So that our confession, that true
   believers may so sin as to be righteously cast out of the external,
   visible society of a particular church, doth no way enforce us to
   acknowledge that they may sin above the rate of them who are overtaken
   with or surprised in sin upon the account of their weakness or
   infirmity.

   2. The church of Christ, in rejecting of one from its society,
   according to the appointment of Jesus Christ, is so far from being
   obliged to judge any one for ever excluded from the kingdom of God,
   that they do so reject a man that he may never be excluded from that
   kingdom. It is true, he may be ecclesiastically and declaratively
   excluded from the visible kingdom of God, and his right and title to
   the outward administration of the good things thereof; but that such an
   one is, and must be thought to be, properly and really excluded from
   his interest in the love of God and grace of the covenant (being still,
   by the appointment of God and command of Christ, left under the power
   of an ordinance annexed by him to the administration of that covenant),
   it doth not follow.

   3. The non-restoration of persons cast out of communion by the church
   to their place in the kingdom of God, but upon repentance, holds
   proportion with what was spoken before upon exclusion. The repentance
   intended is such as is necessary for the satisfaction of the church, as
   to its expressness and being known. Yet we grant withal that all sins
   whatever without repentance, in that kind and degree that is appointed
   and accepted of God, are exclusive of the kingdom of God; and we do
   much wonder that Mr Goodwin to the text, Rom. viii. 1, should add,
   "Whether they repent or not," which is not only beyond the sense of
   what went before, but directly contrary to that which follows after,
   "Who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Not to repent of
   sin is doubtless to "walk after the flesh." No one of them who are
   freed from condemnation in Christ doth good, and sinneth not. The
   words, we confess, are not the condition, in the intention of God, on
   which their non-condemnation is suspended; but yet they are a
   description infallible of them who through grace are made partakers of
   it. We say, then, that believers may so fall as that being [they may
   be?] on that account rejected from the communion of the church, so as
   not to be restored but upon the evidence of their repentance (and we
   say that repentance is required for all sins, or men cannot be saved,
   wondering what Mr Goodwin, according to his principles, intends by the
   addition to the text of Rom. viii. 1, unless it be that no man stands
   in need of repentance unless he have cast off all faith and interest in
   God, -- a most anti-evangelical assertion), and yet not commit such
   sins as whereby their faith must needs be wholly lost.

   4. There is a twofold right and title to the kingdom of God; a right
   and title, by the profession of a true faith, to the external kingdom
   of God, in regard of its outward administration; and a right and title
   to the eternal kingdom of God, by the possession of a true faith in
   Christ. The former, as it is taken for jus in re, believers may lose
   for a season, though they may not in respect of a remote, original,
   fundamental root, which abides; the latter they never lose nor forfeit.
   We say, also, that repentance for sin being a thing promised of God for
   those that come to him in Christ, upon the account of the engagement of
   his grace for the perseverance of believers, all such fallers into sin
   shall certainly return to the Lord by repentance, who heals their
   backslidings; which Mr Goodwin hath not been able to disprove, of whose
   arguments, and his endeavours to vindicate them from exceptions, this
   is the chief.

   But yet there being two or three things that Mr Goodwin is pleased to
   add to what went before, as objections against his doctrine in general,
   -- though not of this last argument's concernment any more than of any
   others he makes use of, -- because there are in them considerations of
   good advantage to the truth in hand, I shall a little insist upon them
   before I proceed with my intended discourse.

   The first is, "That the doctrine of the saints' apostasy maimeth or
   dismembereth the body of Christ, and brings in an uncouth and unseemly
   interchange of members between Christ and the devil;" which, howsoever
   slighted by Mr Goodwin, is a plea not of the least importance in the
   ease in hand. The "body of Christ" intended is that which is mystical
   and spiritual, not that which is political and visible; his body in
   respect of the real union of every member of it unto him as the head,
   described by the apostle in its relation unto him, Eph. iv. 15, 16, "It
   groweth up unto him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from
   whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which
   every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the
   measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of
   itself in love." So also Col. ii. 19. The body we intend is that
   whereof Christ is the head, not only in a political sense, as the
   supreme governor of it, but in a spiritual, according to the analogy of
   a head natural, from whence life and all influences of it unto the
   members do flow. Of this body, some are, in their spirits, already
   consummated and made perfect in heaven; some are as yet pursuing their
   warfare in all parts of the world, pressing forward to the mark of the
   high calling set before them. Now, that any member of his body, "bone
   of the bone, flesh of the flesh of Christ," given him to make up his
   fullness and mystical perfection, jointed unto him, washed in his
   blood, and loved by him according to the love and care of a head to its
   members, should be plucked off to be east into the fire, and, after it
   hath so closely and vitally been admitted into the participation of his
   fullness and increase, being united to him, become a child of the
   devil, an enemy to him, and sometimes to his fellow-members, so as to
   hate his head and to be hated of his head (when yet "no man ever yet
   hated his own flesh"), -- this we suppose no way to answer that
   inexpressibly intense love which the Lord Jesus bears towards his
   members, and to be exceedingly derogatory to his honour and glory in
   reference to his dealing with Satan, the great enemy of his kingdom.
   But to this Mr Goodwin answers:--

   First, "For dismembering the body of Christ, is it not the law of
   Christ himself, in every particular church or body of his, that as any
   of their members putrefy and discover themselves to be rotten and
   corrupt, they should be cut off by the spiritual sword of
   excommunication? and doth not such a dismembering as this rather tend
   to the honouring and adorning the body of Christ than any ways to maim
   or deform it? And for such a dismembering of the body of Christ which
   the doctrine in hand supposeth to be causable by the members
   themselves, by the voluntary disfaithing of themselves through sin and
   wickedness, neither is the permission of this, upon such terms as it is
   permitted, either unworthy Christ or inconvenient to the body itself."
   Reply, --

   1. That there is no argument will tolerably arise from what is
   practicable and comely in a visible ecclesiastical body of Christ to
   the mystical spiritual body, -- that is, from a particular visible to
   the catholic church of Christ. As to the matter in hand, this is
   evident by the light of this single consideration, that in such an
   ecclesiastical body of Christ there are always, or may be, -- and
   Christ himself, in the rules and laws that he hath given for the
   government thereof, did suppose that there always would be, -- good and
   bad, true saints and empty professors; whereas in the body whereof we
   treat there is no soul actually instated but who is actually united to
   the Head by the inhabitation of the same Spirit. There never was, nor
   shall be to eternity, any dead member of that body. They are all
   "living stones," built upon Him who is the "foundation." Now, surely
   this is an inference attended with darkness to be felt: "Because it may
   be comely, for those to whom the administration of ordinances in the
   visible church of Christ is committed, to cut off a dead member from
   the membership which he holds by his confession of the faith, when he
   discovers himself not to answer the confession he hath made in his
   walking and conversation; therefore Christ himself doth cut off, or one
   way or other lose, any living members of his body mystical, and
   actually by faith instated in the unity of his body with him." And if
   it shall be objected "That even living members, and such as are truly
   so, may yet, for and at a season, be cut off from a visible particular
   body of Christ," I answer, -- (1.) It is true they may be so in respect
   of their ordinary present right to the enjoyment of ordinances, not in
   respect of their remote fundamental right; that still abides. (2.) They
   are so, or may be so, for their amendment, not for their destruction;
   that separation for a season being an expression of as much love and
   tenderness to them in Christ as his joining of them to the body was
   from whence they are so separated. And, (3.) This makes not at all to
   the impairing of the true completeness of the mystical body of Christ
   and the perfection of its parts; for as in particular visible bodies of
   Christ there may be, and are, dead members which have no place in the
   body, but are as excrescences in the vine, and yet the body is not
   rendered monstrous by them, so a true member may be removed and the
   body not be maimed in the least; the member, though perhaps [removed]
   from any such visible body for a season, and yet [being of] the true
   spiritual [body, though] sick and pining, continuing a member thereof
   still. Now, there is nothing of all this that will in any measure agree
   to the plucking off a member from the mystical body of Christ, whereof
   alone we speak. If any should be so separated, it must not only be to
   [the loss of] his present actual enjoyment of union, but to the loss of
   his Spirit also, and with him of all right and title, plea or claim
   whatever, to any interest therein. Neither is it possible that it
   should be a means for the correction and amendment of such an one, it
   lying in a direct tendency to inevitable destruction; separation from
   all interest in Christ can look no other way. So that still the
   uncouthness of such a procedure abideth.

   2. The reason that is added, to put some colour and gloss upon this
   assertion, namely, "That such persons as are affirmed to be so
   separated from the body of Christ do voluntarily disfaith themselves,"
   as it is called, is not to the purpose in hand; for, --

   (1.) The question is about the thing itself, whereunto this answer de
   modo is not satisfactory. It is urged by the argument that it cannot be
   allowed any way; the answer is, "It is done this way!"

   (2.) Were Mr Goodwin desired to explain unto us the manner how
   believers voluntarily do or may disfaith themselves, I suppose he would
   meet with no small difficulties in the undertaking. However, this
   sounds handsomely.

   (3.) That they should so disfaith themselves, through sin and
   wickedness, without being overcome by the temptations of Satan and the
   power of the enemies with whom they have to do and wrestle, doubtless
   will not be affirmed, whilst they continue in their right wits; and if
   they lose them, it will be difficult to manifest bow they can
   voluntarily disfaith themselves. The state wherein they are described
   to be by Mr Goodwin, and the considerations which for their
   preservation he allows them, should not, methinks, suffer him to
   suppose that of their own accord, without provocations or temptations,
   they will wilfully ruin their own souls. Now, that believers should, by
   the power of any temptation or opposition whatever, or what affliction
   soever, arising against them, be prevailed upon to the loss of their
   faith, and so to their dismembering from Christ, is that which is
   objected as an unseemly, uncouth thing; which in this answer Mr Goodwin
   earnestly begs may not be so esteemed, and more he adds not, as yet.

   The following discourse, wherein he pursues the business in hand, is so
   pretty as that I cannot but once more present it to the reader. Saith
   he: "As in a politic or civil corporation, it is better that the
   governors should permit the members respectively to go or be at
   liberty, that so they may follow their business and occupations in the
   world upon the better terms, though by occasion of this liberty they
   may behave themselves in sundry kinds very unworthily, than it would be
   to keep them close prisoners, though hereby the said inconveniences
   might certainly be prevented. In like manner, it is much better for the
   body of Christ, and for the respective members of it, that he should
   leave them at liberty to obey and serve God, and follow the important
   affairs of their souls freely and without any physical necessitation,
   though some do turn this liberty into wantonness, and so into
   destruction, than it would be to deprive them of this liberty, and to
   cause and constrain them to any course whatsoever out of necessity,
   though it is true the committing of much sin and iniquity would be
   prevented hereby in many. The dismembering of the body of Christ's
   apostles by the apostasy of Judas was no disparagement either to Christ
   himself or it."

   Ans. The sum of the whole discourse is, That the Lord Jesus Christ hath
   no way to keep and secure his members to himself, that none of them
   perish, but by taking away their liberty; which rather than do, it is
   more to his honour to let them abuse it to their everlasting
   destruction. And to this end sundry fine supposals are scattered
   through the whole discourse; as, -- 1. That the liberty of believers is
   a liberty to sin, which they may abuse to their own destruction. The
   apostle is of another mind, Rom. vi. 17-19, "God be thanked, that ye
   were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form
   of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye
   became the servants of righteousness," etc. 2. That there is no real
   efficacy of grace, that will certainly fulfil in believers the good
   pleasure of God's goodness, and bring forth the fruits of an abiding
   holiness, but what must needs deprive them in whom it is of their
   liberty. And suitably hereunto, 3. That God having, through Christ,
   made his saints spiritually free from sin unto righteousness, so that,
   with the utmost liberty that they are capable of as creatures, they
   shall surely do good, cannot by his Spirit continue them in that
   condition infallibly without the destruction of their liberty. 4. That
   the spiritual operation of God in and with the wills of men induceth a
   necessitation as to their manner of operation, so that they must act on
   that account as necessary and not as free agents; with such other the
   like supposals, which are so many gross figments, whereof Mr Goodwin
   shall be able to prove no one to eternity. For the removal, then, of
   all the fine words here tendered out of our way, it may suffice to tell
   their author that He who is made redemption to his saints, -- that sets
   them free from their bondage to sin by his Spirit, which is always
   accompanied with liberty; and makes them willing, ready, and free to
   righteousness and holiness in the day of his power towards them; whose
   effectual grace enlargeth and improves all their faculties in their
   operations, with the choicest attendancies as to the manner of their
   working, -- can and doth, by, in, and with the perfect exercise of
   their liberty, keep them to himself in their union and communion with
   him for ever; that this pretended liberty unto sin is a bondage from
   which Christ frees his saints; neither is any thing that can be
   imagined more derogatory to the glory of his grace than to affirm that
   he cannot keep those committed to him infallibly to the end, without
   depriving them of the liberty which they have alone through him. Of
   physical necessitation enough hath been spoken before. Judas was never
   a member of the body of Christ, or of Christ, in the acceptation
   whereof we speak. By the "body of the apostles" is intended only their
   number, of which Judas (though he was never of that body whereof they
   were members) was one.

   Farther; the wickedness of this apprehension, that Christ should lose
   any of those who are true and living members of his mystical body, is
   aggravated upon the account of that state and condition whereinto he
   parts with them, they being thereby made members of Satan and his
   kingdom, God and the devil so interchanging children, to the great
   dishonour and reproach of his name. To this Mr Goodwin replies in the
   28th section:--

   "For the interchange of members between Christ and Satan, the Scripture
   presenteth it as a thing possible, yea, as frequent and ordinary. Know
   ye not,' saith the apostle, that your bodies are the members of Christ?
   Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of
   an harlot?' In the original it is, Aras oun ta mele tou Christou
   poieso, etc; that is, Taking away the members of Christ, shall I make
   them,' etc.; meaning that true believers, who only are the members of
   Christ, disrelate themselves to him, cease to be members of his body,
   whilst they live in a course of whoredom and adultery, and make
   themselves members of another far different relation, namely, of those
   harlots with whom they sinfully converse, and consequently, by such a
   mediation, of the devil."

   Ans. 1. For the sense of that place of the apostle, 1 Cor. vi. 15, as
   far as it relates to the merit of the cause in hand, I shall have
   occasion to speak unto it at large hereafter, and so shall not
   anticipate myself or the reader. For the present, I deny that there is
   the least mention made of any interchange of members between Christ and
   the devil, much less of any such thing as "frequent and ordinary." It
   is true, the apostle says that he that is "joined to an harlot" makes
   his members the "members of an harlot," and on that consideration and
   conclusion, with part of the dignity of believers, whose persons are
   all the members of Christ, persuades them from the sin of fornication;
   that they may so much as fall into that sin he doth not here intimate.
   That men, not only in respect of themselves, and their principles of
   sin, and proneness unto it within, with the prevalency of temptations,
   but also eventually, notwithstanding any regard or respect to other
   external prohibiting causes, may fall into all the sins from which they
   are dehorted, Mr Goodwin hath not proved as yet, nor shall I live to
   see him do it.

   2. For a man to make himself the "member of an harlot" is no more but
   to commit fornication; which whether it be Mr Goodwin's judgment or no,
   that none can fall into or be surprised with but he is ipso facto cut
   off from the body of Christ thereby, I know not. Taking in the
   consideration of what was spoken before concerning the manner of
   regenerate persons' sinning, with what shall be farther argued, I must
   profess I dare not say so. In the meantime, it is punctually denied
   that believers can fall into or live in a course of whoredom and
   adultery; and without such a course they cease not, according to Mr
   Goodwin's sense of these words, to be members of Christ, nor do they
   otherwise become members of the devil. There is nothing here, then,
   that intimates such an interchange in the least.

   3. For Mr Goodwin's criticism upon the word aras, it is hardly worth
   taking notice of; for, --

   (1.) If by "taking" there be meant "taking away," the sense must be,
   that they are first taken away from being "members of Christ" (the word
   expressing a time past in that tendency), and then made "members of an
   harlot;" -- which, first, is not suited to the mind of Mr Goodwin, who
   endeavours to prove their ceasing to be members of Christ by becoming
   members of an harlot, the efficient cause of their ceasing to be joined
   to Christ consisting in their being joined with an harlot; and,
   secondly, destroys the whole of the apostle's reasoning in the place,
   from the great unworthiness of such a way or practice as making the
   members of Christ to be the members of an harlot, because none should
   so be made but those who had first ceased to be members of Christ. And
   so his assertion, instead of an effectual persuasive, should upon the
   matter be entangled in a contradiction to itself. And, --

   (2.) As there is nothing in the place to enforce that sense upon the
   word, so there is nothing in the word to impose that sense upon the
   place. When our Saviour speaks to his disciples, Luke ix. 3, Meden
   airete eis ten hodon, he doth not bid them take nothing away for their
   journey, but "take nothing with them;" and so Mark vi. 8, where his
   command is that meden airosin eis hodon. And in that of Matt. iv. 6,
   when the devil urged to our Saviour, epi cheiron arousi se, he did not
   intimate that the angels should take him away in their hands, but
   support him from hurt. When Jesus ere tous hophthalmous ano, he did not
   take away his eyes out of his head and cast them upward, John xi. 41;
   no more than the angel did his hand when ere ten cheira eis ton
   ouranon, Rev. x. 5; or the apostles their voice when eran phonen pros
   ton Theon, Acts iv. 25. Nor doth Christ command us to take away his
   yoke in that heavenly word of his, Arate ton zumon mou eph' humas,
   Matt. xi. 29. So that there is little help left to this sense imposed
   on the place under consideration from the importance of the word; and
   so, consequently, not the least countenance given to that horrible
   interchange of members between Christ and the devil, which is asserted
   as a usual and frequent thing.

   What he addeth in the close of the section is no less considerable than
   the beginning of it; for saith he, "If it be no dishonour to Christ to
   take in such as have been members of the devil, why should it be any
   disparagement to him to reject such who, by their wicked and abominable
   ways, render themselves unworthy of such a relation?"

   Ans. Believers hold not their relation to Christ upon any worthiness
   that is in themselves for it, but upon the account merely of grace,
   according to the tenor of the covenant of mercy. That they may fall
   into such wicked and abominable ways as shall render them altogether
   unmeet for that relation, according to the law of it, is that great
   argument, called petitio principii, which Mr Goodwin hath used in this
   case a hundred times. But the comparison instituted in the first words
   is admirable. Confessed it is that it is no dishonour to Jesus Christ,
   yea, that it is his great honour, seeing "he came to destroy the works
   of the devil, to bind the strong man, to spoil his goods, to destroy
   him that had the power of death, to deliver them who through fear of
   death were all their lifetime subject to bondage, to deliver his people
   from their sins, washing them in his blood, and to make them a peculiar
   people unto himself, zealous of good works;" -- that it is no
   dishonour, I say, for him to translate them from the power of Satan
   into his own kingdom, "making them meet for the inheritance of the
   saints in light, by redeeming them from their vain conversation," to do
   according as he intended, and to take his own, given him of his Father,
   out of the hands of the tyrant which held them under bondage.
   "Therefore, having undertaken to keep them and preserve them, having so
   overcome Satan in them, for them, by them, broken the head of the
   serpent, it is no dishonour for him to lose ground given for his
   inheritance, with his subjects, members, brethren, children, bone of
   his bone, and flesh of his flesh, into the hand of the devil again."
   What fort is so strong as to hold out against such a battery: If it be
   no honour for Christ to bind Satan and to spoil his goods, then it is
   no dishonour for him to be bound by Satan and to have his goods
   spoiled!

   Another burden upon the shoulders of Mr Goodwin's doctrine, whereof he
   labours to deliver it, is the great absurdity of the repetition of
   regeneration, whereof there is no mention at all in the Scripture, and
   which yet must be asserted by him, unless he will affirm all that fall
   away at any time irrecoverably to perish; which howsoever he waives at
   present, were with much more probability, according to his own
   principles, to be maintained than what he insisteth on.

   "But this repetition of regeneration," saith he, "is not unworthy of
   God, and for men a blessed and happy accommodation." Whether it be
   "unworthy God" or no, the Scripture and the nature of the thing will
   declare. The "accommodation" that it seems to afford unto men, being a
   plain encouragement to sin at the highest rate imaginable, will perhaps
   not be found so happy and blessed unto them. With great noise and
   clamour hath a charge been managed against the doctrine of the saints'
   perseverance, upon the account of its giving supportment to the
   thoughts of men in and under the ways of sin. Whether truth and
   righteousness have been regarded in that charge hath been considered.
   Doubtless it were a matter of no difficulty dearly to evince that this
   doctrine of the "repetition of regeneration" is of the very same
   tendency and import with that which is falsely and injuriously charged
   upon that of the perseverance of the saints. The worst that a man
   thinks he can do by any act of sin is but to sin himself quite out of
   the favour of God, into a state of death and desert of wrath, lie can
   no farther injure his soul than to cast it into the condition of men by
   nature. Tell this man, now, whom you suppose to be under the temptation
   to sin, at least to have in him that great fool the flesh, which longs
   for blessed accommodations to itself, whilst it makes provision to
   fulfil its lusts, that if he should so do, this is an ordinary thing
   for men to do, and yet to be renewed again and to have a second
   regeneration, -- do you not encourage him to venture boldly to satisfy
   his sinful desires, having such a relief against the worst that his
   thoughts and fears can suggest to him?

   But whatever it be, in respect of God or men, yet that so it may be Mr
   Goodwin proves from Heb. vi. 6, where it is said, that "it is
   impossible to renew" some "to repentance;" wherefore some may be
   renewed; -- and in Jude 12 men are said to be "twice dead;" therefore
   they may live twice spiritually. The first proof seems somewhat
   uncouth. The persons spoken of in that place are in Mr G.'s judgment
   believers. There is no place of Scripture wherein he more triumphs in
   his endeavoured confirmation of his thesis. The Holy Ghost says
   expressly of them that it is "impossible to renew them;" "therefore,"
   says Mr G., "it is possible." What is of emphasis in the argument
   mentioned ariseth from two things:-- 1. That they are true believers;
   of which afterward. 2. That they fall totally away. This, then, is the
   importance of Mr G.'s plea from this place, "If true believers fall
   totally away, it is impossible they should be renewed to repentance;
   therefore, if true believers fall totally away, it is possible they
   should be renewed to and by repentance." That there is a failing away
   and a renewing again by repentance of the same persons, we grant. That
   falling away is partial only which is incident unto true believers,
   who, when God heals their backslidings, are renewed by repentance. To
   be renewed by repentance is also taken either for the renovation of our
   natures and our change as unto state and condition, and so it is the
   same with regeneration, and not to be repeated; or for a recovery by
   repentance in respect of personal failings, so it is the daily work of
   our lives. Jude says, some are "twice dead;" that is, utterly so, -- an
   hyperbolical expression, to aggravate their condition. Those to whom
   the gospel is a "savour of death unto death" may well be said to be
   "twice dead." Unto the death that they are involved in and are
   obnoxious to by nature they add a second death, or rather, seal up
   their souls under the power and misery of the other, by contempt of the
   means of life and recovery. Therefore, regeneration may be reiterated,
   "Quod erat demonstrandum."

   Much of the section that remains is taken up in declaring, in many
   words, without the least attempt of proof, that it is agreeable to the
   honour of God to renew men totally fallen away; that is, when those who
   have been quickened by him, washed in the blood of his Son, made
   partakers of the divine nature, embraced in the arms of his love, shall
   despise all this, "disfaith themselves," reject the Lord and his love,
   trample on the blood of the covenant, kill their souls by depriving
   them of spiritual life, proclaim to all the world their dislike of him
   and his covenant of grace. Yet, though He hath not anywhere revealed
   that he will permit any one so to do, or that he will accept of them
   again upon their so doing, Mr Goodwin affirming that for him so to do
   is agreeable to his holiness and righteousness, it is fit that those
   who conceive themselves bound to believe whatever he says should think
   so too. For my part, I am at liberty.

   I should not farther pursue this discourse, nor insist on this
   digression, but that Mr Goodwin hath taken advantage by the mention of
   regeneration to deliver some rare notions of the nature of it, which
   deserve a little our farther taking notice of; for which end,
   doubtless, he published them. To make way, then, for his intendment, he
   informs us, sect. 29, "That regeneration' itself, according to the
   grammatical and proper signification of the word, imports a reiteration
   or repetition of some generation or other. It cannot import a
   repetition of the natural generation of men (the sense of Nicodemus on
   this point was orthodox, who judged such a thing impossible); therefore
   it must import a repetition of a spiritual generation, unless we shall
   say (which I think is the road opinion) that it signifies only the
   spiritual generation, with a kind of reflection upon and unto the birth
   natural."

   Ans. That the grammatical sense of the word imports "a reiteration of
   some generation or other," is only said. Ana hath other significations
   in composition besides the intimating of a reiteration of the same
   thing, either in species or individually the same again, Palingenesia
   would seem rather to enforce such an interpretation than anagennesis,
   which yet it doth not. It is spoken of that which hath no birth
   properly at, all, as Philo, De Mundo, Me monon phthoran tou kosmou
   kategorein alla kai palingenesian anairein. Ana of itself is only
   "through:" Choron an' huleenta, Hom. Od. x, -- "Through a woody
   country." Anastasis, "resurrection," doth not import "again," after
   another rising before, but a restoration from a lost state. So is
   palingenesia used, Matt. xix. 28. To be regenerate is to have a new and
   another generation, not any one repeated. In the place of John
   mentioned by Mr Goodwin, there is mention neither of a repetition of a
   former generation nor directly of a new one; though it be so, it is not
   there called so. Our Saviour at first says, Ean me tis gennethe
   anothen, "Unless a man be born from above," as the word is elsewhere
   rendered, and properly signifies, as John iii. 31, xix. 11; Mark xv.
   38; James iii. 17; and sometimes "of old" or "former days," as Acts
   xxvi. 5. Once only it signifies "again," Gal. iv. 9, but there it
   joined with palin, which restrains it. And in the exposition afterward
   of what he intended by that expression, he calls it simply a being
   "born of water and the Spirit," verse 5, without the least intimation
   of the repetition of any birth, but only the asserting of a new
   spiritual one; called a birth, indeed, with allusion to the birth
   natural, which is the "road opinion," well beaten ever since Christ
   first trod that path. Besides, the very mine thing which is expressed
   under the name of "regeneration," being a spiritual birth, which a man
   had not before, is alto delivered unto us in such words and terms as
   manifest no reiteration of any state, condition, or thing to be
   included therein, as conversion to God, a quickening from death,
   sanctification by the Spirit etc.; all which manifest the induction of
   a new life and form, and not the repetition of another. Hence the
   ancients called baptism "regeneration," being the initial ordinance of
   Christianity, and expressive of the new life which in and through
   Christ we receive; and that from Titus iii. 5. "Regeneration," then,
   neither in the import of the word nor in the nature of the thing, doth
   require a reiteration of any generation, but only the addition of a new
   one to that which a man hath before, and whereunto this doth allude.
   The receiving of a new spiritual birth and life is our "regeneration,
   renovation, resurrection, quickening, implanting into Christ," and the
   like; so that the foundation of the ensuing discourse is a mere
   quagmire, where no firm footing can be obtained.

   And of the same nature is that which ensues: "It is," saith he, "the
   common sense of divines, that the two generations mentioned, the
   natural and spiritual, are membra dividentia, and contradistinguished
   the one unto the other; and so the apostle Peter, too, seems to state
   and represent them, as also our Saviour himself, John iii. 6. Now,
   there can hardly any instance be given where the introducing of one
   contrary fore or quality into the subject is termed a reiteration or
   repetition of the other. Calefaction, for example, is never termed a
   repetition of frigefaction, nor calefaction called a reiteration of
   frigefaction; nor when a regenerate or mortified man dieth his natural
   death is he said to reiterate or repeat his spiritual death."

   Ans. That in the term "regeneration" two births are implied may be
   granted; that the same is intimated to be repeated is denied, and not
   proved at all; and therefore Mr Goodwin says well, that the introducing
   of a contrary form is not called the reiteration of another. No more is
   it here. Our new birth is called our "regeneration," or "new
   generation," in allusion to our natural birth, not as a repetition of
   it. Neither is the allusion in respect of the contrary qualities
   Wherewith the one and the other are attended, but in respect of the
   things themselves; in which regard, as they are not the same, so they
   are not contrary, but diverse. They are both births, -- the one
   natural, the other spiritual. Natural and spiritual, in that sense, are
   not contrary qualities, but diverse adjuncts. And so are the two births
   compared, 1 Pet. i. 23, John i. 13; in which last place our
   regeneration is expressed under the simple term of being "born," with
   distinction to the natural birth, and not the least intimation of the
   iteration of any birth or generation subjoined. So also is it, James i.
   18. So that hitherto little progress is made by Mr Goodwin towards his
   intendment, whatever it be. Thus, then, he expresseth it:--

   "I rather," saith he, "conceive that regeneration,' which the Scripture
   makes appropriable only unto persons living to years of discretion, who
   generally in the days of their youth degenerate from the innocency of
   their childhood and younger years, and corrupt themselves with the
   principles and ways of the world, relates not to the natural generation
   as such, I mean as natural, but unto the spiritual estate and condition
   of men in respect of their natural generation and birth; in and upon
   which they are, if not simply and absolutely, yet comparatively,
   innocent, harmless, free from pride and malice, and, in respect of
   these qualifications, in grace and favour with God, upon the account of
   the death and sufferings of Christ for them, as we shall afterward
   prove."

   Here you have the sum of the design and the doctrine of regeneration
   cleared from all those vain and erroneous opinions wherewith it hath so
   long been clouded! It is the returning of men unto the good state and
   condition wherein they were born, after they have degenerated into ways
   of wickedness. We thought it had been the "quickening of them who are
   by nature dead in trespasses and sins, their being begotten again by
   the will of God, the bestowing of a new principle of Spirit and life
   upon them, a translation from death to life, the opening of blind eyes,
   making them who were darkness to be light in the Lord." It seems we
   have all this while been in the dark, and that regeneration indeed is
   only a returning to that condition from whence we thought it had been a
   delivery. But let us a little see the demonstration of this new notion
   of regeneration.

   1. He saith, "The Scripture makes it appropriable only to them who come
   to years of discretion." Sir, your proof; we cannot take your bare word
   in a thing of this importance. In the place yourself chose to mention
   as the foundation you laid of the inferences you are now making, our
   Saviour says it is a being "born of the Spirit;" doth the Scripture
   make this appropriable only unto men of discretion? Men only of
   discretion, then, can enter into the kingdom of God; for none not so
   born of the Spirit shall enter therein, John iii. 5. If none but men of
   discretion can be born of the Spirit, then infants have no other birth
   but only that of the flesh, and "that which is born of the flesh is
   flesh," verse 6, not capable of entering into the kingdom of heaven.
   Surely you better deserve the title of "Durus pater infantum" than he
   to whom of old it was given. Perhaps a grosser figment was never framed
   by a man of discretion.

   2. It is true, infants are comparatively innocent in respect of actual
   transgressions, but equally nocent and guilty with sinners of
   discretion in respect of natural state and condition. They are no less
   obnoxious to that death from whence our regeneration is a delivery, by
   the bestowing of a new spiritual life, than a sinner of a hundred years
   old. A return to this condition, it seems, is a regeneration. "Quantum
   est in rebus inane!"

   3. The qualifications of infants not regenerated are merely negative,
   and that in respect of the acts of sin, not the habitual seed and root
   of them, for in them dwells no good. That, in respect of these
   qualifications of innocency that are in them by nature, antecedent to
   any regeneration (all which are resolved into a natural impotency of
   perpetrating sin), they are accepted in grace and favour with God, had
   been another new notion, had not Pelagius and Socinus before you fallen
   upon it. "Without faith it is impossible to please God," Heb. xi. 6,
   and "his wrath abideth on them that believe not," John iii. 36. That
   infants have or may have faith, and not be regenerated, will scarcely
   be granted by them who believe the Spirit of Christ to cause
   regeneration where he is bestowed, Titus iii. 5, and all faith to be
   the fruit of that Spirit, Gal. v. 22, 23. Farther; for the
   qualification of infants by nature, how are they brought clean from
   that which is unclean? Are they not connived in sin and brought forth
   in iniquity? or was that David's hard case alone? If they are born of
   the flesh, and are flesh, if they are unclean, how come they to be in
   that estate, upon the account of their qualifications, accepted in the
   love and favour of Him who is "of purer eyes than to behold iniquity?"
   If this be the doctrine of regeneration that Mr Goodwin preaches, I
   desire the Lord to bless them that belong unto him in a deliverance
   from attending thereunto. Of the effects of the death of Christ in
   respect of all children I shall not now treat. That they should be
   saved by Christ, and yet not washed in his blood, not sanctified by his
   Spirit (which to be is to be regenerate), is another new notion of the
   new gospel.

   The countenance which Mr Goodwin would beg to his doctrine from that of
   our Saviour to his disciples, "Except ye be converted and become as
   little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven,"
   reproving their ambition and worldly thoughts, from which they were to
   be weaned, that they might be fit for that gospel state and employment
   whereunto he called them, and wherein they were to serve him, does no
   more advantage him nor the cause he hath undertaken than that other
   caution of our Saviour to the same persons, to be "wise as serpents and
   harmless as doves," would do him that should undertake to prove that
   Christians ought to become pigeons or snakes.

   Thus much, then, we have learned of the mind of Mr Goodwin by his
   digression:-- 1. That no children are regenerate; 2. That they are all
   accepted with God, through Christ, upon the account of the good
   qualifications that are in them; 3. That regeneration is a man's
   returning to the state wherein he was born. And having taken out this
   lesson, which we shall never learn by heart whilst we live, we may now
   proceed.

   I shall only add to the main of the business in hand, that so long as a
   man is a child of God, he cannot, he need not to repeat his
   regeneration. But that one who hath been the child of God should cease
   to be the child of God is somewhat strange. How can that be done
   amongst men, that he should cease to be such a man's son who was his
   son? Those things that stand in relation upon any thing that is past,
   and therefore irrevocable, cannot have their beings continued and their
   relation dissolved. It is impossible but that cause and effect must be
   related one to another. Such is the relation between father and son;
   the foundation of it is an act past and irrevocable, and therefore the
   relation itself is indissoluble. Is it not so with God and his
   children? When they once stand in that relation, it cannot be
   dissolved. But of these things hitherto.

   To proceed with that place of Scripture which I laid as the foundation
   of this discourse: The general way of lust's dealing with the soul in
   the brining forth of sin, whereof there are two acts, expressed James
   i. 14, the one of drawing away, the other enticing, is to be insisted
   on. Upon the first, the person tempted is exelkomenos, "drawn off," or
   "drawn away;" and upon the second, he is deleazomenos, "enticed," or
   "entangled."

   The first stirring of sin is to draw away the soul from what it ought
   to be fixed upon, by its rising up irregularly to some delightful
   object. For a man to be "drawn away" by his lust, is to have his lust
   drawn out to some object suited to it, wherein it delighteth. Now, this
   drawing away denoteth two things:--

   1. The turning of the soul from the actual rectitude of its frame
   towards God. Though the soul cannot always be in actual exercise of
   grace towards God, yet it ought always to be in an immediate readiness
   to any spiritual duty, upon the account whereof, when occasion is
   administered, it doth as naturally go forth to God as a vessel full of
   water floweth forth when vent is given unto it. Hence we are commanded
   "always to pray." Our Saviour giveth a parable to instruct his
   disciples that they ought to pray pantote, Luke xviii. 1; and we are
   commanded to pray adialeiptos, "without ceasing" or "intermission," 1
   Thess. v. 17; which the same apostle in another place calleth praying
   en panti topo, "in every place," namely, as occasion is administered.
   It is not the perpetual exercise of this duty (as the Jews, some of
   them, have ridiculously interpreted the first psalm, of "reading the
   law day and night"), which would shut out and cut off all other duties,
   not only of men's callings and employments as to this life, but all
   other duties of the ways and worship of God whatever; but it is only
   the readiness and promptitude of the heart in its constant frame to
   that necessary duty, that is required. Now, he who is exelkomenos by
   lust is drawn off from this frame; that is, he is interrupted in it by
   his lust diverting unto some sinful object. And as to this particular,
   there is a great difference betwixt the sinning of believers, and those
   who arise not beyond that height which the power of conviction beareth
   them oftentimes up unto; for the main of a true believer's watching, in
   his whole life, and in the course of his walking with God, is directed
   against this off-drawing from that habitual frame of his heart by lust
   and sin. His great business is, as the apostle telleth us, to "take the
   whole armour of God to him," that sin, if it be possible, may make no
   approach to his soul, Eph. vi. 13. It is to keep up his spirits to a
   "hate of every evil way, and to delight in God continually." And
   because they cannot attain in this life unto perfection, they cry out
   of the power of sin leading them captive to the law thereof. They would
   have their wills dead to sin, wholly dead, and have trouble that they
   are not so as to the general frame of their spirits, how oft soever
   they be drawn off. For other persons, they have truly no such frame at
   all, whatever they may be cut into the likeness of by the sharpness of
   scriptural convictions that come upon them; and therefore they watch
   not as to the keeping of it. The deeper you dive into them, the more
   near you come to their hearts, the worse they are; their very inward
   part is wickedness. I speak now of the ordinary frame of the one and
   other.

   This drawing off by sin in believers is by the power of sin, in
   opposition to their will. Their wills lie against it to the utmost;
   they "would not," as was showed, be so drawn off. But as for the
   others, as hath been shown, however their minds may be enlightened, and
   their consciences awakened, and their affections corrected and
   restrained, their wills are wholly dead in sin.

   2. When a man is exelkomenos, or drawn away, there are stricken out
   between the lust and the pleasing object some glances of the heart,
   with thoughts of sin. When lust hath gone thus far, if a violent
   temptation fall in, the person to whom it doth so befall may be
   carried, or rather hurried out and surprised, into no small advance
   towards the perpetration of sin, without the least delight in the sin
   or consent of the will unto it, if he be a godly man. So was it in the
   case of David, in the cutting off the lap of the garment of Saul. Lust
   stirred in him, drew him off from his frame of dependence on God, and
   by the advantage of Saul's presence stirred up thoughts of
   self-security and advantage in him, which carried him almost to the
   very act of sin before he recovered himself. Then, I say, is a man
   "drawn away," not only in respect to the term from whence, but also of
   that whereunto, when the thoughts of the object presented as suitable
   to lust are cast in, though immediately rejected. This I intend by this
   acting of lust; which although it be our sin, as having its rise and
   spring in us, and is continually to be lamented, yet, when it is not
   accompanied with any delight of the heart or consent of the will, but
   the thought of it is like a piece of fiery iron cast into water, which
   maketh a sudden commotion and noise, but yet is suddenly quenched, it
   is that which regenerate men are and may be subject to, which also
   keepeth them humble all their days. There is more in this drawing away
   than a single thought or apprehension of evil amounts to (which may be
   without the least sin: "To know evil is not evil"), but yet it is short
   of the soul's consent unto it.

   The second way wherein lust proceedeth in tempting is by enticing the
   soul; and he who is so dealt withal by it is said to be deleazomenos,
   -- "to be enticed." There is something more in this than in being only
   drawn away. The word here used is twice mentioned in the Second Epistle
   of Peter, chap. ii. Once it is rendered to "beguile," deleazontes
   psuchas asteriktous, verse 14; and in the other "alluring," verse 18.
   It cometh (as is commonly known) from delear, a "bait;" which is from
   dolear or dolos, "deceit," because the end of a bait is to deceive, and
   to catch by deceiving. Thence deleazo is to "entice, to allure, to
   entangle," as men do fishes and birds with baits. That which by this
   expression the Holy Ghost intendeth is the prevalency of lust in
   drawing the soul unto that which is by the casuists termed delectatio
   morosa, "a secret delight" in the evil, abiding some space upon it, so
   that it would do that which it is tempted and enticed unto were it not
   forbidden; as the fish liketh the bait well enough, but is afraid of
   the hook. The soul for a season is captived to like the sin, and so is
   under the power of it, but is afraid of the guilt. It sticketh only at
   this, "How shall it do this great thing, and sin against the Lord?"
   Now, though the mind never frame any intention of fulfilling the evil
   wherewith the soul is thus entangled, or of committing that sin
   whereunto it is allured and enticed, yet the affections having been
   cast into the mould of sin for a, season, and conformed unto it by
   delight (which is the conformity of the affections to the thing
   delighted in), this is a high degree of sin; and that because it is
   directly contrary to that "death unto sin," and the "crucifying of the
   flesh and the lusts thereof," which we are continually called unto. It
   is, in a sense, a making "provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts
   thereof." Provision is made, though the flesh be not suffered to feed
   thereon, but only delight itself with beholding of it.

   I shall not deny but this also may befall a true believer, it being
   chiefly implied in Rom. vii., but yet with a wide difference from the
   condition of other persons, in their being under the power of the
   deceits and beguilements of sin; for, --

   1. This neither doth nor can grow to be the habitual frame of their
   hearts; because, as the apostle telleth us, "they are dead to sin, and
   cannot live any longer therein," Rom. vi. 2, and "their old man is
   crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed," verse
   6. Now, though a man should abstain from all actual sins or open
   committing of sin all his days, yet if he have any habitual delight in
   sift, and defileth his soul with delightful contemplations of sin, he
   liveth to sin and not to God; which a believer cannot do, for "he is
   not under the law, but under grace." To abide in this state is to "wear
   the garment spotted with the flesh." But now, take another person:
   however heightened and wrought up by convictions, unless it be when
   conscience is stirred up, and some affrightment is put upon him, he
   can, as his leisure affords, give his heart the swing in inordinate
   affections, or what else pleaseth and suiteth his state, condition,
   temper, and the like.

   2. A believer is exceedingly troubled upon the account of his being at
   any time led captive to the power of sin in this kind; and the review
   of the frame of his spirit, wherein his affections were by delight
   conformed to any sin, is a matter of sore trouble and deep humiliation
   to him. I am of Austin's mind, De Nup. et Concupis., cap. viii., that
   it is this perpetrating of sin, and not the actual committing of it,
   which the apostle complaineth of, Rom. vii. Two things persuade me
   hereunto:-- First, That it is the ordinary course and walking of a
   regenerate man that Paul describeth in that place, and not his
   extraordinary falls and failings under great and extraordinary
   temptations. This is evident from the whole manner of his discourse,
   and scope of the place. Now, ordinarily, through the grace of God, the
   saints do not do outwardly and practically the things they would not,
   -- that is, commit sin actually as to the outward act; but they are
   ordinarily only swayed to this entanglement by the baits of sin.
   Secondly, It is the sole work of indwelling sin that the apostle there
   describeth, as it is in itself, and not as it is advantaged by other
   temptations, in which it carrieth not believers out to actual sins, as
   to such accomplishment of them, which is their state in respect of
   great temptations only. It is, then, I say, the great burden of their
   souls that they have been in their affections at any time dealing with
   the baits of sin, which causeth them to cry out for help, and filleth
   them with a perpetual self-abhorrency and condemnation.

   3. In such surprisals of sin, although the affections may be ensnared,
   and the judgment and conscience by their tumultuating dethroned for a
   season, yet the will still maketh head against sin in believers, and
   crieth out that, whether it will or no, it is captived and violently
   overborne, calling for relief like a man surprised by an enemy. There
   is an active renitency in the will against sin, whoso bait is exposed
   to the soul, and wherewith it is enticed, allured, or entangled; when
   of all the faculties of the soul, if any thing be done in any act of
   sin in unregenerate men, the will is the ringleader. Conscience may
   grumble, and judgment may plead, but the will runneth headlong to it.

   And thus far have I (by way of digression) proceeded in the difference
   there is betwixt regenerate and unregenerate men, as to the root and
   foundation of sin, as also to their ordinary walking. What is farther
   added by the apostle in the two following degrees, in the place
   mentioned, because thence also may some light be obtained to the
   business in hand, shall be briefly insisted on.

   The next thing in the progress of sin is lust's conceiving. When it
   hath turned off the heart from its communion with God or consideration
   of its duty, and entangled or hampered the affections in delight with
   the sinful object proposed, prevailing with the soul to dwell with some
   complacency upon the thoughts of sin, it then falleth to "conceiving;"
   that is, it warms, foments, cherisheth thoughts and desires of the sin
   entertained, until it so far prevails upon the will (in them in whose
   wills there is an opposition unto it), that, being wearied out with the
   solicitations of the flesh, it giveth over its power, as to its actual
   predominant exercise, and sensibly dissenteth not from the sin
   whereunto it is prompted. That this may sometimes befall a regenerate
   person I have granted before, and what is the difference herein betwixt
   them and unregenerate persons may be collected from what hath been
   already delivered.

   Of the next step of sin, which is its bringing forth, or the actual
   accomplishment of the sin so conceived, as above expressed, there is
   the same reason. Tiktei, "it bringeth out" of its womb the child of sin
   which it had conceived. It is the actual perpetration of sin formerly
   consented unto that is expressed under this metaphor. I have little to
   add upon this head to what was formerly spoken; for, --

   1. As they are not the sins of daily infirmity that are here intended,
   in the place of the apostle under consideration, but such as lie in an
   immediate tendency unto death, as to their eminent guilt; as also being
   the fruit of the heart's conception of sin, by fomenting and warming
   thoughts of sin with delight, until consent unto it be prevalent in the
   soul: so falls of this nature in the saints are extraordinary, and
   always attended with their loss of peace, the weakening of their faith,
   wounding of their souls, and obnoxiousness, without repentance, unto
   death. God, indeed, hath provided better things for them; but for
   themselves, they have done their endeavour to destroy their own souls.

   2. That God never suffereth his saints to fall thus, but it is for the
   accomplishment of some very glorious end of his, in their afflictions,
   trials, patience, humiliation; which he will bring about. These ends of
   God are many and various. I shall not enter into a particular discourse
   concerning them.

   3. That an impenitent continuance in and under the guilt of such a sin
   is a sore sign of a heart that neither hath nor ever had any true
   faith. In others, there is a truth in that of Austin, who affirmed that
   "he dared say that it might be good for some to have fallen into some
   eminent particular sin, for their humiliation and caution all their
   days."

   4. That this frequent conception of sin and bringing of it forth, in
   persons who have been heightened by conviction to a great regularity of
   walking and conversation, is the means whereby they do go forth unto
   that which is mentioned in the last place, which is finishing of sin;
   that is, so to be brought under the power of it as to complete the
   whole work of sin. Now, men bring it forth by the temptations and upon
   the surprisals forementioned; but they that come to finish it, or do
   the whole work of it, in them it will bring forth death. This I take to
   be the intendment of that expression, Hamartia apotelestheisa, "Sin
   perfected." The word apotelein is nowhere used in the New Testament;
   telein and epitelein are. There is ton nomon telein, which is, not to
   do any one act which the law requireth, but to walk studiously and
   constantly according to the rule thereof; and so epitelein, as the
   apostle useth it, Phil. i. 6, where we translate it, as here,
   apotelein. To "perfect the good work," is to walk in the way of grace
   and the gospel unto the end: so to "perfect sin" is to fulfil the work
   of sin and to walk in the way of sin, to be under the dominion and
   reign of sin so far as to be carried out in a course of sinning. And
   this is that alone which we exempt believers from; which that they are
   exempted from, unto all that hath formerly been spoken, I shall add the
   consideration of one place of Scripture, being turned aside from my
   thoughts of handling this at large as the second part of the doctrine
   of the saints' perseverance, the former being grown under my hands
   beyond expectation.

   Now, this place is 1 John iii. 9, "Whosoever is born of God doth not
   commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because
   he is born of God;" -- a place of Scripture that always hath amazed the
   adversaries of the doctrine which hitherto, through the grace of God,
   we have asserted, being in itself fully sufficient to captivate every
   understanding unto the obedience of its truth that is not resolved to
   cleave to a contrary conclusion, let what demonstration soever lie
   against it. In the defence of the doctrine under consideration, should
   we use expressions of the same importance with those here used by the
   apostle, as we should abundantly satisfy ourselves that we had
   delivered our mind and sense to the understanding of any indifferent
   person with whom we might have to do, so we should by no means avoid
   all those imputations of folly and error that our doctrine suffereth
   under from the men that have entertained an enmity against it, as it is
   held forth in equivalent expressions by us. The authority of the Holy
   Ghost hath gained thus much upon our adversaries, that when he
   asserteth in express and expressive terms the very thing or things that
   in us are called "folly," evasions should be studied, and pains taken
   to rack his words to a sense which they will not bear, rather than
   plainly to deny his authority. But let the words, with the scope and
   tendency, be considered. The scope and intendment of the apostle in the
   place is, to give a discriminating character of the children of God and
   the children of the devil. Thus he fully expresseth himself unto us,
   verse 10: "In this," saith he, "the children of God are manifest, and
   the children of the devil: whosoever doth not righteousness is not of
   God, neither he that loveth not his brother;" and withal, to press on
   an exhortation against sin, whereunto he useth the argument that lieth
   in the following words, "If any one sin that thinketh himself to be
   born of God, he deceiveth himself:" verses 7, 8, "Little children, let
   no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as
   he is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil." But how
   proveth he this? In these words, "Whosoever is born of God doth not
   commit sin, -- doth not, cannot sin." Such is the genius and nature of
   the children of God, of them that are born of him, that they do not,
   they cannot sin. You are persuaded that you are so born of God;
   therefore you must press after such a frame, such an ingenie and
   disposition, such a principle, as that thereby you cannot sin. It must
   manifest itself to be in you, if you be the children of God.

   Now, whereas it is offered by Mr Goodwin, chap. x. sect. 27, p. 194,
   "That the context or scope of the whole place doth not invite such an
   exposition as is usually insisted on, because" (saith he) "the intent
   and drift of the apostle, from verse 3 even to the end of the chapter
   (as he that doth but run the context over may read), is not to show or
   argue whether the sons of God may possibly in time so degenerate as to
   live sinfully and die impenitently; but to evince this, that those who
   claim the great honour and privilege of being the children of God
   cannot justify or make good this claim, neither unto others nor unto
   themselves, but by a holy and Christian life and conversation. Now, it
   is one thing to argue and prove who are the sons of God at present;
   another, whether they who are such at present must of necessity always
   so continue. The former is the apostle's theme in the context; the
   latter he is wholly silent of."

   I say, It is evident that the scope of the place is to evince that in
   the children of God, those that are born of him, there is such a
   principle, genius, new nature, as that upon the account thereof they
   cannot sin; and therefore, that those who have not such principles in
   them, whatever their pretences be, are not indeed born of God; -- and
   in this he manifesteth that those who are indeed born of God cannot
   possibly so degenerate as to fall into total impenitency, so as to
   become children of the devil, which he emphatically affirmeth.

   He doth, indeed, declare that none can make good their title to be
   children of God, but those who can justify their claim by a holy and
   Christian conversation; but yet, moreover, he maketh good the assertion
   by this farther discovery which he maketh of their new nature to be
   such as that they cannot sin, or degenerate into a condition of lying
   under the power of a vain conversation. So that though his intent
   should not be primarily to manifest that those who are at present the
   children of God cannot apostatize, but must so continue, yet it is to
   confirm their nature and genius to be such, with the principles which
   from God they have received, that so it shall be with them, so they
   shall abide; and to this he is not silent, but eminently expressive.

   The context being thus clear, the words themselves are a proposition or
   thesis, and a reason for the confirmation of the truth of that
   proposition. The proposition is ready at hand in the words, "He that is
   born of God doth not, cannot commit sin." The reason of the proposition
   confirming the truth thereof is twofold:-- 1. Because he is born of
   God; 2. Because His seed, whereof he is so born, remaineth.

   The proposition is universal: Pas ho gegenemenos ek tou Theou, "Every
   one that is born of God;" whence these two things ensue:-- 1. The truth
   of it hath a necessary cause or causes. Universal propositions must
   have so, or they are not true. If that which is their ground may be
   otherwise, it invalidates their certainty. Such, then, must be the
   cause of this assertion of the apostle. 2. That it compriseth all and
   every one that is interested in that which is the cause of the
   certainty of this universal assertion or proposition; "every one who is
   born of God," that hath this seed, be he young or old, weak or strong,
   wise or foolish, exercised in the ways of God or newly entered into
   them, all is one. Whosoever is thus interested in the foundation is
   equally interested in the inference.

   In the proposition itself may be considered the subject, and what is
   affirmed of it. The subject is, "Every one that is born of God." That
   which is affirmed of it is, "Sinneth not, cannot sin."

   1. For the first, namely, the subject, they are those which are "born
   of God;" and who they are that are so born of God the Scripture is
   clear in, neither is there any difference of importance as to the
   intendment of this expression. Those who suppose that believers of some
   eminency only are denoted in it, do not consider that all believers
   whatever are sharers in the grace intended therein. They are all said
   to be born not of the will of the flesh, but of God, John i. 13; for it
   is ascribed to all believers on the name of Christ, verse 12. He
   begetteth them all of his own will, James i. 18; as also, 1 Pet. i. 23.
   He is said to beget them, as to quicken them, Eph. ii. 1; and they to
   be born of him, as they are quickened or raised from the dead. Two
   things are intimated in this expression:-- (1.) A new principle, habit,
   or spiritual life, which such persons have; hence they are said to be
   "born." As they who are born in the world are partakers of a vital
   principle, that is the foundation of all their actions, so have they
   here a new life, a new vital principle. By their being born are they
   made partakers of it. (2.) The divine original of that principle of
   life is from God. They have the principle of life immediately from him;
   and therefore are said to be "born of God." And both these
   considerations are here used as descriptions of the subject; and in the
   close of the reason of the proposition, they are insisted on as the
   cause of that effect of not sinning: "He sinneth not, because he is
   born of God." Both the nature of the principle itself, which in itself
   is abiding, and the rise or original that it hath from God, have an
   influence into that causality that is ascribed to it; but about this
   there can be no great contest.

   2. That which is affirmed of every such person is, that he "doth not
   commit sin." That this expression is to be attended with its
   restrictions and limitations is evident from that contrariety wherein,
   in its whole latitude, it standeth to sundry other testimonies in the
   book of God, yea, in this very epistle. "There is no man that doeth
   good, and sinneth not," saith Solomon, 1 Kings viii. 46; and, "In many
   things we offend all," saith James, in chap. iii. 2. And this apostle
   putteth all out of question by convincing the best of saints that have
   "communion with the Father and with his Son," that by saying we have no
   sin, by a denial of it, we involve ourselves in the guilt of it: "?If
   we,' we apostles, we who have fellowship with the Father and the Son,
   say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,'?" 1 John i. 8. "Doth not
   commit sin," then, cannot be taken absolutely for Doth not sin at all.
   There is a synecdoche in the words, and they must be restrained to some
   kind of sin, or to some manner or degree in or of sinning. Some say,
   "?He doth not, cannot sin,' is, They do not commit sin with delight,
   not deliberately and with their full and whole will, without reluctancy
   and opposition in their wills unto sin" (which reluctancy is at a vast
   distance from the reluctancy that is raised in wicked men from the
   convictions of their conscience and judgment); which sense is canvassed
   by Mr Goodwin to no advantage at all, sect. 25, for, in the way and
   manner formerly explained, this may well take place. "Doth not commit
   sin," then, is, Doth not so commit sin as that sin should reign in him
   spoken of, and prevail with him to death. There is an emphasis and
   intension in the words, "Doth not commit sin," -- that is, Doth not so
   commit it as to be given up to the power of it; he doth not commit sin
   in such a way as to be separated from communion with God thereby, which
   is only done when sin taketh the rule or reign in any person.

   "This exposition," Mr Goodwin saith, "if it can be made to stand
   upright, will bear the weight of the whole cause depending alone; but
   as it is, it argueth weakness to determine for our own sense in a
   controversy or question, without giving a very substantial reason for
   the exposition." I doubt if Mr Goodwin's discourses in this treatise
   were to be tried by this rule, a man might, upon very substantial
   grounds and reasons, call many of his assertions into controversy. And
   because he addeth, that "such is his hard hap, he can meet with no
   reasons at all," I must needs question whether he made any diligent
   search or no; to this purpose I shall supply him with one or two that
   lie hard at hand.

   This, then, to be the intendment of the words is evident, --

   1. From the scope of the place and aim of the apostle therein; this is,
   to distinguish, as was said, betwixt the children of God and of the
   devil. The children of the devil commit sin: Verse 8, "He that
   committeth sin is of the devil," as he giveth an instance of one that
   did so sin. Verse 12, "Cain," saith he, "was of the devil; he was of
   that wicked one, and he committed sin." How did Cain commit sin?
   Impenitently, to death; that is the committing of sin which is ascribed
   to them that are of the devil, of the wicked one. "Now," saith he,
   "whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin;" that is, he doth not so
   commit sin as the children of the devil, that wicked one, do; he sins
   not to death, with impenitency.

   2. The same apostle doth most eminently clear his own intendment in
   this expression, chap. v. 17, 18, of this epistle, "All unrighteousness
   is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. We know that whosoever is
   born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth
   himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not." That expression, verse
   18, "Sinneth not," standeth in opposition to the sin mentioned, verse
   16, "Sin unto death." "?There is a sin unto death;' but he that is born
   of God sinneth not' unto death." So that both the context and the
   exposition of the words given in a parallel place afford us the sense
   insisted on.

   Three reasons are attempted by Mr Goodwin against this exposition; "and
   many more," saith he, "are at hand," which it seems he is willing to
   spare for another season. Of those that he is pleased to use, I have
   already considered that which is of the chiefest importance, being
   taken from the scope of the place. It hath been already declared, not
   only that the sense by him urged is not suitable to the intendment of
   the Holy Ghost, and that Mr Goodwin is not a little mistaken in his
   analysis of the chapter, but that the exposition insisted on by us is
   from thence enforced.

   His other reasons are:-- first, "That the grammar or letter of the
   phrase breatheth not the least air of such a sense."

   Ans. That the expression is synecdochical was before affirmed; what it
   importeth under the power of that figure is the grammatical sense of
   the words. To the grammatical regularity and signification of them doth
   their figurativeness belong. Let the words be restrained, as the figure
   requireth, and the sense is most proper, as was signified.

   But secondly, saith he, "The phrase of committing sin' is nowhere in
   the Scripture found in such a sense as to sin with final impenitency,
   or to sin to death."

   Ans. The contrary hath been demonstrated. The same phrase necessarily
   importeth no less, verse 8 of this chapter; and an equivalent
   expression, beyond all contradiction, intendeth the same, chap. v. 17,
   18. Besides, a phrase may be so circumstantiated as to be in one only
   place restrained to a sense which it doth not elsewhere necessarily
   import. So that, notwithstanding these exceptions, the exposition of
   the words is clear as before given in. And yet this is all Mr Goodwin
   produceth as his ground and foundation whereon to stand in denying this
   proposition, "He that is born of God sinneth not;" -- that is, falleth
   not under the power of reigning sin, sinneth not to death, as the
   children of the wicked one do: which I shall leave under that
   consideration wherewith it is educed from the scope of the text, and
   the parallel place of chap. v. 17, 18. The truth is, there is not much
   need to contend about this expression, Mr Goodwin granting that the
   intendment of it is, "That such as are born of God do not walk
   ordinarily and customarily in any ways of known sin," sect. 28;
   "which," as he saith, "is the import of that phrase, poiein hamartian"
   (the contrary whereof might yet be easily evinced), -- "he maketh no
   trade or occupation of sinning; that is, he doth not sin in an
   inconsistency of communion with God in the covenant of his grace." Now,
   in this sense he granteth his proposition, "He that is born of God
   sinneth not," -- that is, ordinarily or customarily; that is, so as not
   to be accepted of God; that is, no believer sinneth at such a rate as
   not to be accepted with God. Add now hereunto the ground and reason of
   this assertion, namely, his being born of God, and the abiding of the
   seed in him, and we have obtained all that we desire to evince from
   this place. Because such an one is born of God (which is a reason which
   holdeth good to eternity, being an act irrevocably past), and because
   the seed abideth in him, he cannot sin ordinarily or customarily; which
   kind of sinning alone (as is supposed) can eject the abiding seed; --
   that is, he sinneth not beyond the rate of sins of infirmity, nor in
   any such way as should render him incapable of communion or acceptance
   with God.

   The apostle nextly advanceth farther with his design, and saith, "He
   that is born of God cannot sin;" that is, that sin which he sinneth not
   he cannot sin; he cannot fall under the power of reigning sin unto
   death. I confess the words "can" and "cannot" are variously used in the
   Scriptures; some kind of impossibility, in one respect or other (for
   things may be in some regard impossible that are not so absolutely), it
   always denoteth. The whole of the variety in this kind may be referred
   to two heads:--

   1. That which is morally impossible. Of that it is said that it cannot
   be done. 2 Cor. xiii. 8, saith Paul, "We can do nothing against the
   truth;" and Acts iv. 20, say the apostles, "We cannot but speak the
   things we have seen and heard." It was morally impossible that ever any
   thing should have been done by Paul against the truth; or that the
   apostles, having received the Spirit, should not speak what they had
   seen and heard of Christ. And of many things that are thus morally
   impossible, there are most certain and determinate causes as to make
   the things so impossible as, in respect of the event, to be absolutely
   impossible. It is morally impossible that the devil should do that
   which is spiritually good, and yet absolutely impossible. There is more
   in many a thing that is morally impossible than a mere opposition to
   justice; as we say, "Illud possumus quod jure possumus." The causes of
   moral impossibility may be such as to tie up the thing which it
   relateth unto in an everlasting non-futurition. There is also, --

   2. An impossibility that is physical, from the nature of the things
   themselves. So Jer. xiii. 23, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin?" --
   that is, he cannot. Matt. vii. 18, "A good tree cannot bring forth evil
   fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit;" -- that is,
   nothing can act contrary to its own natural principles. And, as we
   shall see afterward, there is this impossibility in the "cannot" here
   mentioned. They cannot do it, upon the account of the new spiritual
   nature wherewith they are endued.

   Now, there may be a third kind of impossibility in spiritual things
   arising from both these, which one hath not ineptly called the
   ethico-physical or morally-natural, partaking of the nature of both the
   others. It is moral, because it relateth to duty, what is to be done or
   not to be done; and it is physical, because it relateth to a cause or
   principle that can or cannot produce the effect. So our Saviour telleth
   the Pharisees, "How can ye, being evil, speak good things?" or, "ye
   cannot," Matt. xii. 34. "Ye cannot hear my word," John viii. 43. It was
   morally impossible they should either speak or hear, -- that is, either
   do or believe that which is spiritually good, -- having no principle
   that should enable them thereunto, having no root that should bear up
   unto fruit, being evil trees in themselves, and having a principle, a
   root, continually, universally, uninterruptedly, inclining and
   disposing them another way, to acts of a quite contrary nature. Of this
   kind is that impossibility here intimated. The effect denied is morally
   impossible, upon the account of the internal physical cause hindering
   of it.

   However, then, the word in the Scripture may be variously taken, yet
   here it is, from adjacent circumstances, evidently restrained to such a
   signification as, in respect of the event, absolutely rejecteth the
   thing denied. The gradation of the apostle also leadeth us to it. "He
   sinneth not," nay, "he cannot sin." "He cannot sin" riseth in the
   assertion of that before expressed, "He sinneth not;" which absolutely
   rejecteth the gloss that some seek to put upon the words, namely, "That
   cannot sin' is no more but cannot sin easily, and cannot sin but as it
   were with difficulty, such is the antipathy and habitual opposition
   which they have to sin,'?" which Mr Goodwin adhereth unto: for besides
   that this is in itself false, there being no such antipathy in any to
   sin but that they may easily fall into it, yea, and with great
   difficulty and labour do restrain [themselves] from it, as the apostle
   argueth at large, Rom. vii.; so is it also flatly contradictory to the
   words themselves. The apostle saith, "He that is born of God sinneth
   not, cannot sin." "He can sin," saith this gloss, "though difficultly."
   Now, he that can sin difficultly, can sin. "Can sin" and "cannot sin"
   are flatly contradictory. He cannot, then, sin at all the sin that is
   intended in the place of whom it is said, "He cannot sin."

   Thus we have cleared the first proposition in the words, both as to the
   subject, "Every one that is born of God," and the predicate, "Sinneth
   not, cannot sin;" which last expression, taken in its only proper and
   most usual signification, denoteth an impossibility of the event, and
   plainly confirmeth in direct terms the position we insist on from the
   words.

   Mr Goodwin knoweth not well (if I am able to gather any thing of his
   thoughts from his expressions to the argument in hand) what to say to
   this assertion of the apostle. The argument he intendeth to deal withal
   from the place he casteth into this form: "He that sinneth not, neither
   can sin, cannot fall away; whosoever is horn of God sinneth not,
   neither can sin:' ergo."

   Coming to the consideration of that expression, "Cannot sin," he
   findeth out, as he supposeth, four several acceptations in the
   Scripture of the word "cannot," and giveth us an account of his
   thoughts upon the consideration of them, -- that in respect of these
   senses both propositions are false. Now, one of the propositions being
   the express language and literal expression of the Holy Ghost, not
   varied in the least, there is no way to relieve himself from being
   thought and conceived to give the lie to the blessed Spirit of God, by
   flatly denying what he peremptorily affirmeth, but only by denying the
   word "cannot" to be taken in this place in any of the senses before
   mentioned. Doth he then fix on this course for his own extrication?
   doth he give in another sense of the word, which he accepts, and grants
   that in that sense the affirmation of the Holy Ghost may be true? Not
   in the least; yea, plainly, for one of the senses he supposeth himself
   to have found out of the word "cannot," -- namely, that it is said of
   men they cannot do such or such a thing, because of their averseness
   and indisposition to it, which he exemplifieth in that of Christ to the
   Pharisees, John viii. 43, -- he afterward more than insinuateth that
   this is the sense wherein the words "Cannot sin" are in this place to
   be taken, sect. 34: so that he will not allow the Holy Ghost to speak
   the truth, although he take his words in what sense he pleaseth; yea,
   and adding a fifth sense, sect. 31 (which is all, it seemeth, he could
   find out, for we have heard not of any more), he denieth that to be the
   meaning of the place: and so shutteth up the mind of the Holy Ghost
   into some of those significations wherein if the words be taken, he
   saith, they are false. The discourse of Mr Goodwin, sect. 28-30 (being
   taken up with the consideration of the various significations of the
   word "cannot," and his inferences thereon, taking it in this place,
   this way or that way, then it is so or so, showing himself very skilful
   at fencing and warding off the force of our arguments, -- as perhaps
   his thoughts of himself were upon a review of what he had done), we are
   not concerned in. And though it were very easy to manifest that, in the
   distribution of his instances for the exemplification of the several
   significations which in part he feigneth and fasteneth upon the words,
   he hath been overtaken with many gross mistakes, some of them
   occasioned by other corrupt principles than those now under
   consideration, yet none of the senses insisted on by him coming really
   up to the intendment of the Holy Ghost, without any disadvantage to our
   cause in hand, being wholly unconcerned therein, we may pass by that
   whole harangue.

   That which looketh towards the argument under consideration appeareth
   first in sect. 31, which he thus proposeth: "If the said argument
   understandeth the phrase Cannot sin,' according to the fifth and last
   import mentioned of the word cannot,' wherein it soundeth an utter and
   absolute incapacity and impossibility, then in this sense the major
   proposition is granted, namely, He that doth not nor can sin cannot
   fall away from his faith.' Yet the minor is tardy, which saith,
   Whosoever is born of God sinneth not, neither can sin:' for he that is
   born of God is in no such incapacity of sinning; of sinning, I mean, in
   the sense formerly asserted to the scripture in hand, which amounteth
   to an absolute impossibility for him so to sin."

   Ans. Because this seemeth to be the sense intended in the argument, and
   the minor proposition in this sense to be built upon the scripture in
   hand, let us consider whether the reason which is assigned for the said
   assertion doth necessarily enforce such a sense thereon. What we
   understand by this phrase, both as to that sin that is here intended,
   and that impossibility of committing it, or falling into it often, in
   that expression "cannot," hath been before discovered. An impossibility
   it is of the event, from the causes above mentioned, that the Holy
   Ghost intendeth. An utter and absolute incapacity to sin on any account
   we assert not; an impossibility of so sinning, in respect of the event,
   for the reasons and from the causes above mentioned, the Holy Ghost
   averreth. In this sense the first proposition is granted: "He that doth
   not commit sin, nor can sin, cannot fall away from his faith, or can
   [not] utterly lose it." The minor, which is the express language of the
   Holy Ghost, is questioned, and found tardy; that is, as I suppose,
   false. And the reason is added, namely, "That he that is born of God is
   in no such incapacity of sinning;" that is, of sinning in that kind of
   sinning which is here intended, which amounteth to an impossibility for
   him so to sin. Not to play fast and loose, under these ambiguous
   expressions of "incapacity" and "Absolute impossibility," the event is
   positively denied upon the account of the prohibiting causes of it; and
   the incapacity asserted relateth not to the internal frame and
   principle only, but respecteth also other considerations. Whether these
   are such as to bear the weight of this exposition, is that which cometh
   nextly to be discussed; namely, the causes of this state and condition
   of those who are thus born of God, and the reasons investing that
   universal proposition, "Every one that is born of God cannot sin," with
   a necessary truth.

   In the reasons added of the former affirmation, there is an emphatical
   distribution of the two parts of the predicate of the former
   proposition, by the way of ascending to a more vehement confirmation of
   them: "He that is born of God sinneth not." But why so? "His seed
   remaineth; neither can he sin." Why so? "Because he is born of God." It
   is an expressive pursuit of the same thing, and not a redoubling of the
   proposition; and this contexture of the words is so emphatically
   significant that it seemeth strange how any head of opposition can be
   made against it. There is no reason, then, to resolve the words into
   two propositions of distinct consideration each from other, it being
   one and the same thing that the apostle intendeth to express, though
   proceeding to heighten the certainty of the thing in the minds of them
   to whom he delivered it by the contexture of the words which he maketh
   use of. What is meant or intended by the "seed of God" we need not
   dispute. The argument of the apostle lieth not in the words "seed of
   God," nor in the word "abideth," but in the whole, "The seed of God
   abideth;" and therefore it were to no purpose at all to follow Mr
   Goodwin in his consideration of the word "seed," and then of the
   [words] "seed of God," and then of the word "abideth,' divided one from
   another. The sum of his long answer is, "The word seed' doth not import
   any such thing as is aimed at from the text., nor the word abide;'?"
   but to the whole proposition, "The seed of God abideth in him," as
   produced to confirm the former assertion of the not sinning of the
   persons spoken of, there is nothing spoken at all. I shall therefore
   briefly confirm the argument in hand by the strength here communicated
   unto it by the Holy Ghost, and then consider what is answered to any
   part of it, or objected to the interpretation insisted on. That "lie
   that sinneth not, neither can sin," in the sense explained, shall never
   fall away totally or finally from God, is granted. That believers sin
   not, nor can sin so, or in the manner mentioned, besides the testimony
   of the Holy Ghost, worthy of all acceptation, in the clear assertion of
   it, we have the reasons thereof manifested in the discovery of the
   causes of its truth. The first reason is, "Because the seed of God
   abideth in them." A tacit grant seemeth to be made that fruit sometimes
   may not visibly appear upon them; as the case is with a tree in winter
   when it casts its leaves, but its seed remaineth. Grace may abide in
   the habit in and under a winter of temptation, though it doth not exert
   itself in bearing any such actual fruit as may be ordinarily visible.
   The word of God is sometimes called "incorruptible seed," -- seed
   causatively, as being an instrument in the hand of God whereby he
   planteth the seed of life and holiness in the heart. That it is not the
   outward word, but that which is produced and effected by it through the
   efficacy of the Spirit of God, that is by "seed" intended, is evident
   from the use and nature of it, and its abiding in the person in whom it
   is. Whatever it is, it is called "seed," not in respect of that from
   whence it cometh, as is the cause and reason of that appellation of
   other seed, but in respect of that which it produceth, which ariseth
   and ensueth upon it; and it is called the "seed of God," because God
   useth it for the regeneration of his. Being from God, being the
   principle of the regeneration of them in whom it is, abiding in them
   even when it hath brought forth fruit, and continuing so to do, it can
   be no other but the new creature, new nature, inward man, new principle
   of life or habit of grace, that is bestowed upon all believers, whence
   they are regenerated, quickened, or born again; of which we have spoken
   before.

   This seed, saith the Holy Ghost, "abideth" or "remaineth in him."
   Whatever falling or withering he may seem to have or hath, this seed,
   the seed of God, remaineth in him, -- the principle of his new life
   abideth. Some exceptions are made, as we shall see afterward, to the
   signification of the word menei, "remaineth," and instances given where
   it signifieth "to be," and denoteth the essence of a thing, not its
   duration. That to "abide," or "remain," is the proper signification of
   the word, I suppose will not be questioned. That it may in some place
   be used in another sense is not disputed. All that lieth under
   consideration here is, whether the word in this place be used properly,
   according to its genuine and first signification, or no. It supposeth,
   indeed, "to be" also, but properly signifieth only to "abide" or
   "remain." Now, if nothing can be advanced, from the text or context,
   from the matter treated on or the parallel significancy of some
   expression that is in conjunction with it, that should enforce us to
   carry it from its proper use and signification, the instancing of other
   places, if any such be, wherein it is restrained to denote being, and
   not duration, is altogether impertinent to the business in hand. When
   an argument is urged from any place of Scripture, to pick out any word
   in the text, and to manifest that it hath been used improperly in some
   other place, and therefore must be so in that, is a procedure so far
   from an ingenuous answer, that it will scarce pass for a tolerable
   shift or evasion. To "remain," then, or to "abide," is the proper
   signification of this word, and nothing is in the least offered to
   manifest that it must necessarily in this place be diverted from its
   proper use.

   According to the import of the word, the seed of God remaineth in
   believers. Now, that remaining of the seed is the cause of their not
   sinning that sin, or in that manner as the apostle here denieth them to
   be liable to sin; for that is the reason he giveth why they cannot sin,
   even because the seed of God remaineth in them. Mr Goodwin granteth
   that this seed remaineth in believers always, unless they sin by a
   total defection from God. Of not sinning the sin of total defection
   from God, the remaining or abiding of this seed is the cause. Whilst
   that abideth they cannot sin that sin; for it is an unquestionable
   cause, and uncontrollable, of their not so doing. This seed, therefore,
   must be utterly lost and taken away before any such sin can be
   committed. Now, if the seed cannot be lost without the commission of
   the sin, which cannot be committed till it be lost, neither can the
   seed be lost nor the sin be committed. The same thing cannot be before
   and after itself. He that cannot go such a journey unless he have such
   a horse, and cannot have such a horse unless he go such a journey, is
   like to stay at home. In what sense the words "Cannot sin" are to be
   taken was before declared. That there are sins innumerable whereinto
   men may fall notwithstanding this seed, is confessed. Under them all
   this seed abideth. So it would not do under that which we cannot sin
   because it abideth; but because it abideth that sin cannot be
   committed.

   The latter part of the reason of the apostle's assertion is, "For he is
   born of God;" which is, indeed, a driving on the former to its head and
   fountain. What it is to be "born of God" we need not dispute; it was
   sufficiently discovered in the mention that was made before of the
   "seed of God." God, by his Holy Spirit bestowing on us a new spiritual
   life, which by nature we have not, and in respect of whose want we are
   said to be dead, is frequently said to "beget" us, James i. 18, and we
   are said to be "born of God." He is the sovereign disposer, dispenser,
   and supreme fountain, of that life which is so bestowed on us, which we
   are begotten again unto, and are born with and by. And Jesus Christ,
   the mediator, is also said to have this "life in himself," John v. 26,
   because he hath received the Spirit of the Father to give to his, for
   their quickening; who taketh of his, and thereby begetteth them anew.
   And this life which believers thus receive, and whereby, indeed,
   radically they become believers, is everywhere in Scripture noted as
   permanent and abiding. In respect of the original of it, it is said to
   be "from above, from heaven, of the will of God, of God;" as to its
   principle, to be "not of flesh, or blood, or of the will of man," or of
   any thing done by us, but of the "seed of God, incorruptible seed, seed
   that abideth;" in respect of its duration, to be "eternal," and that it
   may so be, to be safe-guarded, being "hid with Christ in God." In this
   place, receiving this life from God is placed as the cause, and "Cannot
   sin" as the effect. "He cannot sin, for" or because, "he is born of
   God." The connection that is between this cause and effect, or wherein
   the causality of being born of God to a not sinning doth consist, needs
   not be inquired into. That it hath such a causality the Holy Ghost hath
   asserted, and our argument resteth thereon. If that be the nature of
   regeneration or being born of God, that it doth exclude apostasy, then
   he that is regenerate or born of God, as every believer is, cannot so
   sin as to apostatize or fall totally from God; but that such is the
   nature of regeneration, whereby any one is born of God, the Holy Ghost
   here declareth, for he denieth apostasy upon the account of
   regeneration, "He cannot sin, because he is born of God;" which is that
   which we intended to demonstrate from this text of Scripture.

   To evade the force of this argument, Mr Goodwin, as hath been declared,
   undertaketh to give an exposition of this place of Scripture, turning
   every stone, and labouring to wrest every word in it. The several
   significations of the words in other places are set out, and
   suppositions made of taking them this way or that way; but in what
   sense the scope of the matter treated on, and the most usual, known,
   common acceptations, call for their use in this place, nothing is
   spoken, neither is any clear answer once attempted to be given to the
   words of the text, speaking out and home to the conclusion we intend,
   or to the argument thence deduced. What I can gather up from sect. 31
   and forwards, that may obstruct the thoughts of any in closing with the
   interpretation given, I shall consider and remove out of the way:--
   First, then, he giveth you this interpretation of these words, "Sinneth
   not," or "Cannot sin:" "?Every one that hath been born of God sinneth
   not;' that is, whosoever hath, by the word and Spirit of God, been made
   partaker of the divine nature, so as to resemble God in the frame and
   constitution of his heart and soul, doth not, under such a frame or
   change of heart as this, make a trade or practice of sinning, or of
   walking in any course of inordinateness in the world. Yea, saith he, in
   the latter proposition, Every such person doth not only or simply
   refrain sinning in such a sense, but he cannot sin;' that is, he hath a
   strong and potent disposition in him which carrieth him another way,
   for he hath a strong antipathy or averseness of heart and soul against
   all sin, especially all such kind of sinning."

   Ans. 1. What is meant by being "born of God," the way whereby any come
   so to be, the universality of the expression, requiring a necessary
   cause of its verity, with the like attendancies of the proposition,
   have been before declared.

   2. What Mr Goodwin intendeth by such a "frame and constitution of heart
   and soul as may resemble God," with his denial of the stowing on us
   from God of a vital principle of grace, wherein the renovation in us of
   his image should consist, hath in part also been already discovered,
   and will yet farther be so, in our consideration of his rare notion of
   regeneration, and its consisting in a man's return to the innocent and
   harmless estate wherein he was born.

   3. That "Sinneth not" is "Sinneth not that sin," or "So sinneth not as
   to break his relation to God as a child," hath been already also
   manifested, and the reader is not to be burdened with repetitions.

   4. In the interpretation given of the latter phrase, "He cannot sin," I
   cannot so sin against the light of the text as to join with Mr Goodwin
   in it. It is not the "antipathy of his heart to sin," but the course of
   his walking with God in respect of sin, that the apostle treateth on.
   His internal principling against sin he hath from being "born of God"
   and the "abiding of his seed in him;" of which this, that "he cannot
   sin," is asserted as the effect. "He cannot sin," -- that is, he cannot
   so sin upon the account of his being "born of God" (thence, indeed, he
   hath not only "a potent disposition another way and antipathy to evil,"
   but a vital principle with an everlasting enmity and repugnancy to and
   inconsistency with any such sin or sinning as is intimated); and that
   he cannot sin is the consequent and effect thereof, and is so affirmed
   to be by the Holy Ghost.

   Nextly, Mr Goodwin giveth you the reason of this assertion used by the
   apostle, why such an one as of whom he speaketh sinneth not, and cannot
   sin: "?Now the reason,' saith the apostle, why such a person committeth
   not sin in the sense explained is, because his seed, the seed of God,
   by whom and of which he was born of him, remaineth in him;' that is,
   is, or hath an actual and present being or residence, in him. And that
   in this place it doth not signify any perpetual abiding, or any abiding
   in relation to the future, is evident, because the abiding of the seed
   here spoken of is given as the reason why he that is born of God doth
   not commit sin; that is, doth not frequently walk in any course of
   known sin. Now, nothing in respect of any future permanency or
   continuance of being can be looked upon as the cause of an effect, but
   only in respect of the present being or residence of it. The reason why
   the soul moveth today is not because it will move or act the body
   tomorrow, or because it is in the body today upon such terms that it
   will be in tomorrow also, much less because it is an immortal
   substance, but simply because it is now or this day in the body. So the
   reason why angels at this day do the will of God is not because they
   have such a principle of holiness or obedience in them which they
   cannot put off or lose to eternity, but because of such a principle as
   we speak of residing in them at present. Therefore, when John assigneth
   the remaining of the seed of God in him that is born of him for the
   reason why he doth not commit sin, certain it is that by this remaining
   of the seed he meaneth nothing else but the present residence or abode
   thereof in this person; and if his intent had been either to assert or
   imply a perpetual residence of this seed in him that is born of God, it
   had been much more proper for him to have saved it for a reason of the
   latter proposition, He that is born of God cannot sin,' than to have
   subjoined it as a reason of the former; for though the future
   continuance of the thing in being can be no reason of the effect
   present, yet it will be a ground or reason of the continuance of a
   present effect."

   Ans. I have thus at large transcribed this discourse, because it is the
   sum of what Mr Goodwin hath to offer for the weakening of our argument
   from this place. Of what weight this is will quickly appear; for, --

   1. This reason, "The seed abideth in him," though brought in
   illatively, in respect of what was said before, "He doth not commit
   sin," yet hath its causal influence chiefly into that which followeth,
   "He cannot sin." To make good what was first spoken of his not
   commiting sin that is born of God, the apostle discovereth the cause of
   it; which so far secureth the truth of that expression as that it
   causeth it to ascend, and calls him up higher, to a certain
   impossibility of doing of that which was only at first simply denied.
   Neither is this assertion, "The seed of God abideth in him," any
   otherwise a reason of the first assertion, "He committeth not sin,"
   than as it is the cause of the latter, "He cannot sin." Now, Mr Goodwin
   granteth, in the close of his discourse, that "the future continuance
   of a thing in being is, or may be, the cause of the continuance of an
   effect which at present it produceth;" -- and what [ever] Mr Goodwin
   may more curiously discover of the intent of the apostle, his words
   plainly assert the continuance and abode of the seed of God in them in
   whom it is; and using it as he doth, for a reason of the latter clause
   of that proposition, "He cannot sin," he speaketh properly enough, so
   great a master (of one language at least) as Mr Goodwin being judge.

   2. The reason insisted on by the apostle is neither from the word
   "seed," nor from the word "abideth," nor from the nature of the seed
   simply considered, nor from its permanency and continuance, "The seed
   abideth;" so that it is no exception to the intendment of the apostle
   to assert the abiding of the seed not to be a sufficient cause of the
   proposition, because its abiding or permanency is not a cause of
   present not sinning, for it is not asserted that it is. His present not
   sinning in whom it is, is from God, his being born of God by the seed;
   his continuance and estate of not sinning (both which are intended) is
   from the abiding of the seed. The whole condition of the person, that
   "He sinneth not, neither can sin" (which terms regard his continued
   estate), is from the whole proposition, "The seed of God abideth in
   him." Separate the permanency of the seed, which is asserted, in the
   consideration of it, and it respects only and solely the continuance of
   the effect which is produced by it as seed, or of the estate wherein
   any one is placed by being born of God. All that Mr Goodwin hath to
   offer in this case is, that the abiding of the seed is so asserted to
   be the reason of that part of the proposition, "He committeth not sin,"
   as not to be the cause tes auxeseos, "He cannot sin;" when the abiding
   of the seed, singly considered, is not used as any reason at all of the
   first, nor in the proposition as it lieth, "The seed abideth," any
   otherwise but as it is the cause of the latter, "He cannot sin."

   3. Even the expression, "He committeth not sin," denoteth not only the
   present actual frame and walking of him of whom it is spoken, but his
   estate and condition. Being once born of God, he committeth not sin. No
   one that is so born of God doth. None in the state and condition of a
   regenerate person doth so; that is, in his course and walking to the
   end. And this is argued not so much distinctly to the permanency of the
   seed, as from the seed with such an adjunct.

   4. Mr Goodwin's allusions to the soul and the obedience of angels are
   of little use, or none at all, to the illustration of the business in
   hand; for though the reason why the soul moveth the body today is not
   because it will move it tomorrow, yet the reason why the body moveth,
   and cannot but do so, is because it hath the soul abiding in it, and he
   that shall say, "He that liveth moveth, for he hath a soul abiding in
   him and cannot but move," shall speak properly enough. And the reason
   why the angels do the will of God in heaven, -- that is, actually
   continue in so doing, -- is, because they have such a confirmed and
   uncontrollable principle of obedience. So that all these exceptions
   amount not to the least weakening of the apostle's arguments.

   Sect. 32. Our author giveth two instances to prove that the word menei
   in the Scripture signifieth sometimes only "to be," and not "to abide,"
   and they are, the one, John xiv. 17, and the other, 1 John iii. 14; and
   one argument to manifest that in the place under consideration it must
   needs signify a present abode and being, and not a continuance, etc.

   Ans. 1. If any such places be found, yet it is confessed that it is an
   unusual sense of the word, and a thousand places of that kind will not
   enforce it to be so taken in another place, unless the circumstances of
   it and matter whereabout it treateth enforce that sense, and will not
   bear that which is proper.

   2. Mr Goodwin doth not make it good by the instances he produceth that
   the word is tied up in any place to denote precisely only the being of
   a thing, without relation to its abiding and continuance. Of the one,
   John xiv. 17, "But ye know him, because he abideth with you, and shall
   be in you," saith he, "The latter clause, Shall be in you,' will be
   found a mere tautology if the other phrase, Abideth with you,'
   importeth a perpetual residence or in-being." But that this phrase,
   "Abideth with you," importeth the same with the phrase in the foregoing
   verse, where it is clearly expounded by the addition of the term "For
   ever" ("That he may abide with you for ever"), I suppose cannot be
   questioned. Nor, --

   3. Is there any the least appearance of a tautology in the words, his
   remaining with believers being the thing promised, and his in-being the
   manner of his abode with them. Also 1 John iii. 14, Menei en to
   thanato, doth not simply denote an estate or condition, but an estate
   or condition in its nature, without the interposition of almighty
   grace, abiding and permanent; so that neither have we yet any instance
   of restraining the significancy of the word, as pretended, produced;
   nor, if any place could be so, would it in the least enforce that
   acceptation of the word in this place contended about. Wherefore Mr
   Goodwin, as I said, addeth an argument to evince that the word must
   necessarily be taken in the sense by him insisted on in this place;
   which is indeed a course to the purpose, if his argument prove so in
   any measure; it is this: "Because such a signification of it would
   render the sense altogether inconsistent with the scope of the apostle,
   which is to exhort Christians unto righteousness and love of the
   brethren. Now, it is contrary to common sense itself to signify unto
   those whom we persuade to any duty any such thing as imports an
   absolute certainty or necessity of their doing it, whether they take
   care or use any means for the doing of it or no; and a clear case it is
   that the certainty of a perpetual remaining of the seed of God in those
   that are born of him importeth a like certainty of their perpetual
   performance of that duty whereunto they are exhorted."

   Ans. If this be all, it might have been spared. The argument consisteth
   of two parts:-- 1. An aspersion of the infinite wisdom of God with a
   procedure contrary to all reason and common sense. 2. A begging of the
   thing in question betwixt its author and its adversaries. That there is
   any thing at all in the text, even according to our interpretation of
   it, that importeth an absolute necessity of men's doing any thing,
   whether they take care to use the means of doing it or no, the reader
   must judge. The abiding of the seed is that, we say, which shall
   effectually cause them in whom it is to use the means of not sinning,
   that eventually they may not do so; and that a certainty of the use of
   means is imported is no argument to prove that their necessity of
   persevering is proved, whether they use means or no. To take care to
   use means is amongst the means appointed to be used; and this they
   shall do upon the account of the abiding seed. That, indeed, which is
   opposed is, that God cannot promise to work effectually in us by the
   use of means, for the accomplishment of an appointed end, but that
   withal he rendereth useless and vain all his exhortations to us to use
   those means. This is Mr Goodwin's argument from the place itself, to
   enforce that improper acceptation of the words "Remaineth in us."

   What remaineth of Mr Goodwin's long discourse upon this text of
   Scripture is but a fencing with himself, and raising of objections and
   answering of them suitably to his own principles, wherein we are not in
   the least concerned. There is not any thing from the beginning to the
   end of it that tendeth to impeach our interpretation of the place, or
   impede the progress of our argument, but only a flourish set up on his
   own exposition; which if he were desired to give in briefly, and in
   terms of a plain, downright significancy, I am verily persuaded he
   would be hardly put to it to let us know what his mind and conceptions
   of this place of Scripture are. But of this subject, and in answer to
   his fifth argument, with the chapter, this is the issue.

Chapter XVI. The bearing of the doctrine of the saints' apostasy on their
consolation.

   Mr G.'s seventh argument, about the tendency of the doctrine of the
   saints' apostasy as to their consolation, proposed, considered -- What
   that doctrine offereth for the consolation of the saints stated -- The
   impossibility of its affording the least true consolation manifested --
   The influence of the doctrine of the saints' perseverance into their
   consolation -- The medium whereby Mr G. confirms his argument examine
   -- What kind of nurse for the peace and consolation of the saints the
   doctrine of apostasy is -- Whether their obedience be furthered by it
   -- What are the causes and springs of true consolation -- Mr G.'s
   eighth argument proposed to consideration -- Answer thereunto -- The
   minor proposition considered -- The Holy Ghost not afraid of the
   saints' miscarriages -- The confirmation of his minor proposition
   proposed and considered -- The discourse assigned to the Holy Ghost by
   Mr G., according to our principles, considered -- Exceptions against it
   -- The first -- The second -- The third -- The fourth -- The fifth --
   The sixth -- The seventh -- The foundation of Mr G.'s pageant everted
   -- The procedure of the Holy Ghost in exhortations, according to our
   principles -- Sophisms in the former discourse further discovered --
   His farther plea in this case proposed, considered -- The instance of
   Christ and his obedience considered and vindicated, as to the
   application of it to the business in hand -- Mr G.'s last argument
   proposed, examined -- 1 John ii. 19 explained; vindicated -- Argument
   from thence for the perseverance of the saints -- Mr G.'s exceptions
   thereunto considered and removed -- The same words farther pursued --
   Mr G.'s consent with the Remonstrants manifested by his transcriptions
   from their Synodalia -- Our argument from 1 John ii. 19 fully cleared
   -- The conclusion of the examination of Mr G.'s arguments for the
   apostasy of the saints.

   The seventh argument, which Mr Goodwin insisteth upon in the 36th
   section of his 13th chapter, contains one of the greatest rarities he
   hath to show in the whole pack, concerning the influence of the
   doctrine of the saints' apostasy into their consolation in their
   walking with God; an undertaking so uncapable of any logical
   confirmation, as that though Mr Goodwin interweaves his discourse
   concerning it with a syllogism, yet he quickly leaves that thorny path,
   and pursues it only with a rhetorical flourish of words, found out and
   set in order to deceive. At the head, then, of his discourse, he
   placeth this argument, as it is called:--

   "That doctrine whose genuine and proper tendency is to advance the
   peace and joy of the saints in believing is of a natural sympathy with
   the gospel, and upon this account a truth; such is the doctrine which
   informeth the saints of a possibility of their total and final falling
   away: ergo."

   The proposition of this syllogism he supposes we will grant; and (not
   to trouble the reader with the qualifications and limitations formerly
   annexed to that which proposed the furtherance of the obedience of the
   saints as a proof of the truth of any doctrine) for my part I do. For
   the proof of the assumption, wherein alone Mr Goodwin's interest in
   this argument doth lie, he refers us to his 9th chapter, where, as he
   tells us (if we may believe him), he hath "undeniably demonstrated the
   truth of it;" but we have considered whatever looks that way in that
   chapter, and have found it all as chaff and stubble before the breath
   of the Spirit of the Lord in the word. That which lies upon his
   shoulders to support (a burden too heavy for him to bear), and whose
   demonstration he hath undertaken, is, that it tends to the peace, joy,
   and consolation, of the saints of God, in their walking with him (which
   arises from, and solely depends upon, that assurance they have of their
   eternal fruition of him through Christ), to be instructed that indeed
   they are in themselves weak, unable to do any thing as they ought; that
   they have no strength to continue in the mercy of God, but carry about
   with them a body of death; and that they are continually exposed to a
   world of temptations, whereby many strong men fall down, are thrust
   through, and slain every day; that in this condition there is no
   consideration of the immutability or unchangeableness of God that may
   secure them of the continuance of his love to them, no eternal purpose
   of his that he will preserve them and keep them through his power, no
   promise of not leaving them, or of giving them such supplies of his
   Spirit and grace that they shall never forsake or leave him, nothing in
   the covenant, or oath of God whereby it is confirmed, to assure them of
   an abiding and not-to-be-destroyed communion with him; that Christ by
   his death and oblation hath not so taken away the guilt of their sins,
   nor laid such a sure foundation for the destruction of the power of
   them, as that they shall not arise either way to their ruin; that he
   intercedes not for their preservation in faith and holiness; -- upon
   the account of which state and condition of things, many of the most
   eminent saints that ever served God in this world have utterly fallen
   out of his love and favour, and have been cast out of covenant, from
   whence, though perhaps some few have been recovered, yet far the
   greatest part of them have perished everlastingly (as is the state in
   reference unto many in every generation): only, such may do well to
   consider what a fearful and desperate issue their apostasy will have if
   they should so fall, and what an eminent reward, with what glory, is
   proposed to them, if they persevere. That, I say, the instruction of
   the saints in this doctrine is a singular means of promoting their
   consolation and establishing their peace is that which (doubtless with
   undervaluing thoughts of all with whom he hath to do) he hath
   undertaken to prove. I doubt not but that Mr Goodwin thought sometimes
   of the good old rule:--


   "Sumite materiam vestris, qui scribitis, æquam

   Viribus; et versate diu, quid ferre recusent,

   Quid valeant humeri."

   Hor. Ep. ad Pison., 38.

   Self-confidence is hereby settled and fixed with considerations; and
   though Mr Goodwin, in the close of this section, tells us "that sundry
   godly and seriously religious persons, when they heard this doctrine
   published which he now asserts, with their whole hearts blessed God for
   it," yet truly I cannot but question whether, yea, I must positively
   deny that ever, any saint of God received consolation by the doctrine
   of the saints' apostasy, -- a lie exceedingly unsuited to the
   production of any such effect, any farther than that all error
   whatsoever is apt to defile and cauterize the conscience, so deceiving
   it with senselessness for peace. Perhaps some of Mr Goodwin's hearers,
   (who either were so ignorant or so negligent as not to be acquainted
   with this doctrine before, in the attempts made for the propagation of
   it by the later brood of prelates and Arminians amongst us,) upon his
   delivery of it with enticing words of human wisdom, helped on by the
   venerable esteem they have of his transcendent parts and abilities,
   through the cunning of Satan, improving the itching after new doctrines
   which is fallen upon the minds and spirits of many professors in this
   age, have rejoiced under the shadow of this bramble, set up to rule in
   their congregation, and (according as is the constant manner of all in
   our days that are ensnared with any error, be it never so pernicious)
   have blessed God for it, professing they never found rest nor peace
   before: yet I no way question but such as fear the Lord, and are yet
   bowed down under the weight and carried away with the strength of Mr
   Goodwin's rhetoric for a season, will quickly find a fire proceeding
   out of that newly-enthroned doctrine, preying upon and consuming all
   their joy, peace, and consolation; or (which I rather hope) a fire
   proceeding out of their faith "the faith once delivered to the saints,"
   to the utter confusion and consumption of this bramble, -- [this]
   scratching error. In the meantime, if the eminent appearance of many
   thousands of the saints of God in this nation (whereof many are fallen
   asleep, and many continue to this day), testifying and bearing witness
   to the joy and consolation they have found, and that upon spiritual,
   demonstrative grounds, in being cast into the mould of the doctrine of
   the saints' perseverance, for many days, be of no weight with Mr
   Goodwin, I know not why his single testimony (which yet, as to the
   matter of fact, I no way question) concerning some few persons, by
   himself seduced into a persuasion of their apostasy, blessing God for
   the discovery made to them (the constant practice of all persons in
   their first entanglement in the foulest and grossest error whatever),
   should sway us much to any good liking of it.

   The influence of the doctrine of the saints' perseverance into their
   consolation hath been sufficiently already evinced, when we manifested
   the support of their faith and love, the conquest of their fears and
   troubles thereby, so that I shall not need farther to insist thereon.
   It was in my thoughts, indeed, to have handled the nature of gospel
   consolation, -- that which God is so abundantly willing the heirs of
   promise should receive, -- at large, both as to the nature and causes
   of it, the means of its preservation, and the oppositions that lie
   against it; and by all the considerations of it to have manifested that
   it is utterly impossible to keep it alive one moment in the heart of a
   believer without the contribution of supportment it receives from the
   doctrine in hand, and that those who refuse to receive it, as usually
   delivered, indeed have none, nor can have any drop of it, but what is
   instilled into them from and by the power and efficacy which secretly
   in and upon their hearts that truth hath which in words they oppose,
   all their peace and comfort being indeed absolutely proportioned to
   that which the doctrine of the saints' perseverance tends to confirm,
   and to nothing else: but this discourse growing under my hands beyond
   all thought or expectation, I shall now only keep close to the removal
   of the exceptions made against it, and hasten to a close.

   I must not leave this argument without taking notice of the medium
   whereby Mr Goodwin supposeth himself to have confirmed the truth of the
   assumption laid down at the entrance, or to have manifested "the good
   complexion," as he phrases it, "of that nurse he hath provided" for the
   consolation of the saints. A nurse with breasts of flint and a heart of
   iron hath this cruel man provided for them; -- a nurse whom God will
   never admit into his family, nor ever expose his children's lives to
   any such wolf or tiger as will certainly starve them, if not devour
   them; -- rather a curst, yea, an accursed stepdame than a nurse, who
   when the children ask for bread gives them a stone, and when they beg
   for a fish gives them a scorpion; -- a false and treacherous hireling,
   doing not the least service for God, but labouring to stir up strife in
   his family, to set his poor children and their heavenly Father at
   variance; filling them with hard thoughts of him, as one that takes
   little or no care for them, and discouraging them in that obedience
   which he requireth at their hands; continually belying their Father to
   them, and that in reference to the most desirable excellencies of his
   faithfulness, truth, mercy, and grace; never speaking one good or
   comfortable word to them all their days, nor once urging them to do
   their duty but with holding a rod, yea scorpions, over their heads, and
   casting the eternal flames of hell into their faces. This is that
   sanguine, indeed truly spiritually bloody, complexion of this new
   nurse, which is offered to be received in the room of that sad,
   melancholy piece, the perseverance of the saints. Thus, then, he
   proceeds:--

   "The consolation of true believers depends upon their obedience; their
   obedience is furthered by this doctrine: and therefore their
   consolation also."

   Ans. What are the springs of true, spiritual, heavenly consolation, the
   consolation which God is willing believers should receive, whence it
   flows, the means of its continuance and increase, how remote it is from
   a sole dependency on our own obedience, hath been in part before
   declared. But yet if the next assertion can be made good, namely, "That
   the doctrine of the saints' apostasy hath a tendency, instituted of
   God, to the promotion of their obedience and holiness," I shall not
   contend about the other, concerning the issuing of their consolation
   from thence. All that really is offered in the behalf of apostasy, as
   to its serviceableness in this kind, is, that it is suited to
   ingenerate in believers a fear of hell, which will put them upon all
   ways of mortifying the flesh and the fruits of it, which otherwise
   would bring them thereinto. And is this indeed the great mystery of the
   gospel? Is this Christ's way of dealing with his saints? or is it not a
   falling from grace, to return again unto the law? Those of whom alone
   we speak, who are concerned in this business, are all of them taken
   into the glorious liberty of the sons of God; are every one of them
   partakers of that Spirit with whom is liberty; are all endued with a
   living principle of grace, faith, and love, and are constrained by the
   love of Christ to live to him; are all under grace, and not under the
   law; all have their sins in some measure begun to be mortified, and the
   flesh with the lusts thereof, the old man, with all his ways and wills,
   crucified, by the death and cross of Christ, brought with their power
   and efficacy by the Spirit into their hearts; are all delivered from
   that bondage wherein they were, for fear of death and hell, all their
   days, by having Christ made redemption unto them I say, that these
   persons should be most effectually stirred up to obedience by the dread
   and terror of the iron rod of vengeance and hell, and that they should
   be so by God's appointment, is such a new, such another gospel, as,
   though preached by an angel from heaven, we should not receive. That
   indeed no motive can be taken from hence, or from any thing in the
   doctrine by Mr Goodwin contended for, suited to the principle of gospel
   obedience in the saints; that no sin or lust whatsoever was ever
   mortified by it; that it is a clog, hinderance, and burden to all
   saints, as far as they have to do with it, in the ways of God, -- hath
   been before demonstrated: and therefore, leaving it, with all the
   consolation that it affords, unto those who of God are given up
   thereunto, we proceed to the consideration of another argument, his
   eighth in this case, which is thus proposed, sect. 37:--

   "That doctrine which evacuates and turns into weakness and folly all
   the gracious counsels of the Holy Ghost, which consist partly in the
   diligent information which he gives unto the saints, from place to
   place, concerning the hostile, cruel, and bloody mind and intention of
   Satan against them; partly in detecting and making known all his subtle
   stratagems, his plots, methods, and dangerous machinations against
   them; partly, also, in furnishing them with special weapons of all
   sorts, whereby they may be able to grapple with him and to triumph over
   him; partly, again, in those frequent admonitions and exhortations to
   quit themselves like men in resisting him, which are found in the
   Scripture; and, lastly, in professing his fear lest Satan should
   circumvent and deceive them; -- that doctrine, I say, which reflects
   disparagement and vanity upon all these most serious and gracious
   applications of the Holy Ghost must needs be a doctrine of vanity and
   error, and consequently that which opposeth it, by a like necessity, a
   truth; but such is the common doctrine of absolute and infallible
   perseverance: ergo."

   Ans. Not to engage into any needless contest about ways of arguing when
   the design and strength of the argument are evident, I shall only
   remark two things upon this:--

   First, The Holy Ghost professing his fear lest Satan should beguile
   believers is a mistake. It was Paul that was so afraid, not the Holy
   Ghost, though he wrote that fear by the appointment and inspiration of
   the Holy Ghost. The apostle was jealous lest the saints should, by the
   craft of Satan, be seduced into errors and miscarriages; which yet
   argues not their final defection. This, indeed, he records of himself;
   but of the fear of the Holy Ghost, arising from his uncertainty of
   those issues of the things, and want of power to prevent the coming on
   of the things feared, I suppose there is no mention. And, --

   Secondly, That the consequent of the supposition in the inference made
   upon it is not so clear to me as to Mr Goodwin, -- namely, "Suppose any
   doctrine to be false, whatsoever doctrine is set up in opposition to it
   is true." I have known, and so hath Mr Goodwin also, when the truth
   hath lain between opposite doctrines, assaulted by both, entertained by
   neither. With these observations I pass the major of this syllogism;
   the minor he thus confirms:--

   "If the saints be in no possibility of being finally overcome by Satan,
   or of miscarrying in the great and most important business of their
   salvation, by his snares and subtleties, all that operoseness and
   diligence of the Holy Ghost, in those late-mentioned addressments of
   his unto them, in order to their final conquest over Satan will be
   found of very light consequence, of little concernment to them; yea, if
   the said addressments of the Holy Ghost be compared with the state and
   condition of the saints, as the said doctrine of perseverance
   representeth and affirmeth it to be, the utter uselessness and
   impertinency of them will much more evidently appear."

   Ans. What possibility or not possibility the saints are in of final
   apostasy from God; what assurance themselves have, may have, or have
   not, concerning their perseverance; with what is the use of admonitions
   and exhortations to them in that condition, -- have been already
   declared. For the present I shall only add, that let their final
   apostasy in respect of the event be never so impossible, yet, in the
   state and condition wherein they are, and from the things which they
   are exercised about, with the principles on which they proceed, and the
   ways whereby they are led on, considerations enough may be raised to
   set forth those exhortations, admonitions, and encouragements,
   appointed by the Holy Ghost to be used and insisted on in the
   administration of the word, in the beauty and splendour of infinite
   wisdom, love, and kindness. The glory of God being so eminently
   concerned as it is in the obedience and fruitfulness of the saints; the
   honour of the Lord Jesus in this world, with the advancement and
   propagation of the gospel, in like manner relating thereunto; their own
   peace lying so much as it doth upon their close walking with God; the
   Spirit being so grieved by their failing into sin as he is; God so
   dishonoured, and themselves exposed to such fearful desertions,
   darkness, trouble, sorrow, and disquietments as they are, upon their
   being overcome by the temptations of Satan, and prevailed upon to turn
   aside into ways and sins short of total apostasy; and it being the
   purpose of the Lord to lead them on in obedience, in ways suitable to
   that nature he created them withal, and that new nature wherewith he
   hath endued them (both apt to be wrought upon by motives, exhortations,
   and persuasions), without any such supposal as that of final apostasy;
   -- there is a sufficient bottom and foundation of exalting the motives
   and admonitions insisted on to the possession of that glory of wisdom
   and goodness which is their due. But Mr Goodwin having borrowed another
   pageant from the Remonstrants, had a great mind to show it to the world
   in its English dress, and therefore introduces the Holy Ghost thus
   speaking in the admonitions above pointed at:--

   "Suppose we, then, the Holy Ghost should speak thus unto the saints: O
   ye that truly believe, who, by virtue of the promises of that God that
   cannot lie, are fully persuaded and possessed that ye shall be kept by
   God, by his irresistible grace, in true faith until death; so that
   though Satan should set all his wits on work, and by all his
   stratagems, snares, and cunning devices, seek to destroy you; yea,
   though he should entice you away from God by the allurements of the
   world, and entangle you with them again; yea, and should cause you to
   run and rush headlong, against the light of your own consciences, into
   all manner of horrid sins; yet shall all his attempts and assaults upon
   you in every kind be in vain, and you shall be in never the more danger
   or possibility of perishing; -- unto you, I say, attend and consider
   how sore and dangerous a contest you are like to be engaged in; for you
   are to wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities
   and powers, the governors of this world, and spiritual wickednesses,
   against that old serpent the devil, the great red dragon, who was a
   murderer from the beginning, and who still goes about like a roaring
   lion, seeking whom he may devour, who will set himself with all his
   might to thrust you headlong into all manner of sins, and so to
   separate between you and your God for ever. And truly I am afraid lest,
   as the serpent by his subtlety deceived Eve, so your minds should be
   corrupted from the simplicity which is in Jesus Christ, -- lest the
   tempter should any way tempt you, and my labour about you be in vain.
   Therefore watch, pray, resist him steadfast in the faith. Take unto you
   the whole armour of God, that you may be able to resist in an evil day,
   and having done all things stand fast, -- stand, having your loins girt
   with the girdle of truth, and the breastplate of righteousness upon
   you.' Would such an oration or speech as this be any way worthy the
   infinite wisdom of the Holy Ghost? Or is it not the part of a very weak
   and simple person to admonish a man, and that in a most serious and
   solemn manner, of a danger threatening him or hanging over his head,
   and withal to instruct him with great variety of direction and caution
   how to escape this danger, when, as both himself knows and the person
   admonished knows likewise, it is a thing altogether impossible that
   ever the danger should befall him, or the evil against which he is so
   solemnly cautioned come upon him? Therefore, those who make the Holy
   Ghost to have part and fellowship in such weakness as this are most
   insufferably injurious unto him."

   Ans. To support the stage for to act this part of the pageant in hand
   upon, there are many supposals fixed by our author, that are to bear up
   the weight of the whole; which, upon trial, will appear to be arrant
   false pretences, painted antics, that have not the least strength or
   efficacy for the end and purpose whereunto they are applied.

   1. It is supposed that the end of all these admonitions is merely and
   solely to prevent the saints from final apostasy, and that they are to
   beware of the wiles and assaults of Satan, only lest he prevail over
   them to cause them to depart utterly from God. That this is supposed in
   this discourse is evident, because upon the granting of a promise that
   they shall not be so prevailed against, they are judged all useless and
   ridiculous. Now, who knows not but that Satan may winnow, and in some
   measure prevail against, the saints, to the dishonour of God, the
   reproach of the gospel, grieving of the Spirit, and scandal of the
   church, although they fall not totally and finally from God? And that
   many of those admonitions tend to the preservation of believers from
   such falls and failings is more evident than to need any demonstration
   by consideration of the particular instances.

   2. It supposeth, as is expressed, that believers may fall into "all
   manner of horrid sins and abominations;" which is the thing in
   question, and by us punctually denied. Whatever their surprisals may
   be, yet there are sins which they cannot fall into; and the great
   abomination of every sin that is committed with the whole heart and
   with full consent they are not at all exposed or liable unto, as hath
   been proved.

   3. That there is an inconsistency between promises and precepts in
   reference to the same object; that God should promise to work any thing
   effectually in us and yet require it of us, is thought ridiculous; and
   on this account the great folly here imputed to the discourse framed
   for the Holy Ghost is proposed to consist in this, that God should
   exhort us to watch against the assaults of the devil, and yet promise
   that by his grace he will effectually work in us and for us the very
   same thing, -- a supposal destructive to the whole nature of the new
   covenant, easily disproved by innumerable instances.

   4. That believers are to be wrought upon to obedience always, whatever
   the frame of their spirits be, by the same ways and means. Hence it is
   that promises, promises of highest and greatest assurance, are in this
   discourse coupled with cautions of the deepest charge, as though they
   must at the same time operate the same way to believers, or else the
   Holy Ghost be liable to be traduced as inconsistent with himself; when
   the great variety that is in their spiritual frame and temper, the
   manifold temptations wherewith they are assaulted, the light and dark
   places they walk through, etc., give occasion sufficient to the
   exercising towards them all the "piping" and "mourning" that is
   provided for them.

   5. That all believers are assured of their perseverance, and that to
   such a degree as not to fear any apostasy or to care what becomes of
   them (that is, assured to presumption, not believing), -- and therefore
   are those cautions and admonitions of the Holy Ghost on that account,
   tending to stir up in them any godly care or fear, rendered frustrate,
   -- when Mr Goodwin himself thinks that very few of them do upon any
   good and abiding foundation know themselves to be believers, and we
   never once supposed that all of them have assurance of their
   perseverance, nor any of them upon the terms here proposed. All the
   strength of what is here insinuated lies in this, that God gives
   assurance to men of the steadfastness and constancy of his love under
   supposal of their failing into all manner of abominable sins; which
   supposal alone renders an inconsistency between the sense of the
   promises we embrace and that of the admonitions that are given to the
   saints charging them to walk heedfully and to watch diligently against
   the attempts and assaults of Satan. Now, this supposal is in itself
   false and ridiculous; neither ever did the Lord, nor do we say he ever
   did, tender men assurance of his love on such terms, neither is it
   possible for any one ever to have a true persuasion of his own
   perseverance under such notions.

   6. That there is an inconsistency betwixt faithful promises of
   attaining an end by the use of means, and exhortations with admonitions
   to make use of those means So that if it be supposed that God promiseth
   that Satan shall not in the issue prevail over us, prescribing to us
   the means whereby we shall be preserved from his prevalency, it is in
   vain to deal with us for the application of ourselves unto the use of
   those means.

   7. It is also supposed that an assurance of the love of God, and of the
   continuance of it to the saints unto the end, so that they shall never
   be utterly rejected by him, is an effectual way and means to induce
   them to carnal and loose walking, and a negligence in those things
   which are a provocation to the eyes of his glory; and therefore, if he
   promise faithfully never to leave us nor forsake us, it is an
   inducement for us to conclude, Let the devil now take his swing, and do
   with us what he pleaseth. To exhort us to take care for the avoidance
   of his subtleties and opposition is a thing altogether ridiculous. The
   vanity of this supposal hath been sufficiently before discovered and
   itself disproved.

   Upon such hypotheses as these, I say, upon such painted posts, is the
   whole pageant erected which we are here engaged withal; and these being
   easily cast down, the whole rushes to the ground, in the room whereof,
   according to our principles, this following discourse may be
   supplied:--

   "Ye that are true believers, called, justified, sanctified, by the
   Spirit and blood of Christ, adopted into my family, ingrafted in and
   united unto the Son of my love, I know your weakness, insufficiency,
   disability, darkness, how that without my Son and continual supply of
   his Spirit ye can do nothing. The power of your indwelling sin is not
   hid from me, how with violence it leads you captive to the law thereof.
   And though ye do believe, yet I know ye have also some unhealed
   unbelief, and on that account are often overwhelmed with fears,
   sorrows, disconsolations, and troubles, and are ready often to think
   that your way is passed over from me, and your judgment hidden from
   your God. And in this condition I know the assaults, temptations, and
   oppositions of Satan that you are exposed to, how he goes up and down
   like a roaring lion, seeking to destroy you. His ways, methods, wiles,
   and baits, that he lays for you, and whereby he seeks to destroy you,
   are many. He acts against you as a serpent, subtilely and wisely; as a
   lion, dreadfully and fearfully; and [as a fowler,] with snares not of
   you, by yourselves, to be resisted. You have principalities and powers
   to wrestle withal, and the darts of the wicked one to defend yourselves
   against. Wherefore beware of him, be not ignorant of his devices, stand
   fast in the faith, take to you the whole armour of God, resist him,
   overcome him, cast him out by prayer and the blood of the Lamb; watch
   night and day that ye be not surprised nor seduced (as Eve was) by him,
   that he turn you not out of the way into paths leading to destruction,
   and thrust you headlong into such sins as will be a dishonour to me, a
   grief to my Spirit, a scandal to the church, and bitterness to your own
   souls. And as for me, who know your disability of yourselves to do any
   of these things, and so to hold out to the end, because it pleased me
   to love you, and set my heart upon you, having chosen you before the
   foundation of the world, that ye should be holy and unblamable before
   me in love; and having given my only Son for you, who is your peace,
   and through whom ye have received the atonement, with whom I will not
   deny you or withhold from you any thing that may safeguard your abiding
   with me unto salvation, -- I will, through the riches of my grace, work
   all your works for you, fulfilling in you all the good pleasure of my
   goodness and the work of faith with power. I will tread down Satan,
   this cruel, proud, malicious, bloody, enemy of your souls, under your
   feet; and though at any time he foil you, yet ye shall not be cast
   down, for I will take you up, and will certainly preserve you by my
   power to the end of your hope, the salvation of your souls. Whatever
   betide you or befall you, I will never leave you nor forsake you. The
   mountains may depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall
   never be removed from you. Comfort ye, be of good courage, and run with
   patience the race that is set before you." This, I say, is the language
   which, according to the tenor of the doctrine whose maintenance we are
   engaged in, God speaks to his saints and believers; and if there be
   folly and inconsistency found therein, let the Scriptures vindicate and
   plead for themselves.

   For the close of this discourse of our author, charging this course of
   procedure with folly, -- namely, to give admonition to the use of
   means, when the end is certainly determined to issue upon the use of
   those means, -- he must first evince it, as to the application of it to
   the business in hand, before I can close with him in the managing
   thereof. For the present, I rather think the folly of this charge, as
   far as it looks towards the doctrine under consideration, to arise from
   other things: as, --

   First, An impertinent comparison instituted between God and man in
   their admonitions and dealings with men, as though nothing might beseem
   him, in spiritual things of eternal concernment, but what is squared to
   the rules of our proceedings one towards another in things natural or
   civil. And, --

   Secondly, A false supposal that the end is promised and assured to any
   without or beside the use of means, or walking according to the rules,
   precepts, and instructions, given for that purpose, or for attainment
   of the end so promised. Now, what folly there is to charge men to use
   means for the attaining of an end, when they are, although exhorted,
   also assured that in their so doing they shall attain the end aimed at,
   is yet under contest, and may pass for the present with those other
   "ridiculous supposals" formerly mentioned.

   But Mr Goodwin proceeds farther in the vindication of this argument,
   sect. 38:--

   "And whereas," saith he, "they still plead, or pretend rather, that
   such admonitions as those lately specified may well stand with an
   unconditional promise of perseverance, we have formerly showed that
   they are not able to make good this plea, nor to give any reasonable
   account of it. Whereas they add, that their sense and opinion is not
   that it is a thing absolutely or every way impossible for true
   believers to fall away totally or finally from their faith, but that
   they willingly grant that true believers, what through their own
   weakness, and what through the subtle baits and temptations of Satan,
   may so fall away; I answer, But this is but a fig-leaf sought out to
   cover the nakedness of their opinion, which hath no strength at all nor
   weight in it; for what though it were in a thousand other respects
   never so possible for true believers to perish, yet if it be altogether
   impossible in such a respect which overrules all those others, and
   which will, and of necessity must, hinder the coming of it to pass, all
   those others notwithstanding, it is to be judged simply and absolutely
   impossible, and all those respects whereby it is pretended possible are
   not to be brought into account in such a case."

   Ans. 1. Whether we are able to make good our plea concerning the
   consistency of admonitions with the promises of perseverance, Mr
   Goodwin is not the sole judge, neither do either we or our plea stand
   or fall at his arbitrament. What hath been lately spoken for the
   re-enforcement of that plea against his exceptions, he may, if he
   please, take time to consider.

   2. For what is now added in this place as a part of that plea of ours,
   as it is here proposed, we own not. We do not grant that true believers
   may fall away, on any account whatever, totally and finally, if the
   expression, "May fall away," relate to the issue and event. We say,
   indeed, that by the temptations of Satan believers may be prevailed
   against to the committing of many sins, the root whereof is in
   themselves, whilst the lust remains in them which tempteth and
   ensnareth them, whereby God may be dishonoured and their own
   consciences wounded, -- which is a sufficient ground and bottom for all
   the admonitions that are given them, to beware of his deceits, to
   strengthen themselves against his assaults, to be built upon, --
   though, through the grace and faithfulness of God and his good-will,
   manifested and secured unto them in his covenant and promises, he can
   never totally prevail against them.

   We say, moreover, that it is not from believers themselves, nor any
   thing in them, nor from any faith that they have received, that they
   cannot so fall finally away, there being in them a proneness to sin,
   and the seed of all sin still remaining, yea, a root of bitterness
   ready to spring up and trouble them; but from those outward principles
   of the will, purposes, covenant, and promises of God, which we have
   formerly insisted on: farther, that there is no need of granting any
   such possibility, taking that term as relating to the issue and event,
   and not the internal principle of operation in men, to manifest the
   harmony that is between the admonitions under consideration and the
   promises we have insisted on, it being sufficiently evinced on other
   considerations: so that Mr Goodwin's ensuing discourse concerning
   "absolute impossibility" is not at all related to any thing that we
   have asserted.

   3. Neither yet doth the reason by Mr Goodwin produced in any measure
   evince what he intends, though we be not concerned therein. He will not
   easily persuade us that that which is possible in any respect, much
   less in many, and impossible only in one, is always to be judged
   "simply and absolutely impossible." Much less are we concerned in it,
   who say that simply and absolutely the falling away of believers is
   possible, namely, as the term "possible" relates to the principle of
   operation in them; but in some respect only it is impossible, that is,
   not of itself, but in respect of the external prohibiting cause. It was
   simply and absolutely possible that the bones of our Saviour should
   have been broken, in the nature of the thing itself; impossible, in
   respect of the decree of God. So are a thousand things absolutely
   possible in their own nature, as to the power of the causes whereby
   they might be produced, but impossible in respect of some external
   prohibiting cause; -- absolutely possible in respect of their proper
   cause and principle; impossible in respect of the event, upon the
   account of some external prohibiting cause, as was showed. So it is in
   the business in hand. We assert not any possibility in respect of the
   event, as though in the issue it might so come to pass that believers
   should fall totally and finally from God, which is the thing we oppose;
   but grant it in respect of the causes of such apostasy, with reference
   to the nature of the thing itself, though how the possibility might be
   reduced into act Mr Goodwin cannot declare. As for the close of this
   section, concerning the absolute, peremptory, irresistible decree of
   perseverance, which he ascribes to us as our assertion, when he shall
   have convinced us of the conditional, non-peremptory, reversible decree
   of God, which he endeavours to introduce in the place thereof, he may
   hear more of us; in the meantime, menomen hosper esmen.

   Sect. 39, 40, he seeks to alleviate the instance commonly given of our
   Saviour Christ, who though assured of the end, and in respect of whom
   it was utterly impossible that his glorious exaltation should not
   follow in the issue, he being wholly out of all danger of being
   detained under the power of death, yet he laboured, and prayed, and
   fasted, and resisted Satan's temptations, and watched against him, and
   dealt with him by weapons taken out of the word of God; and in
   especial, when the devil urged him with the argument in hand, "that
   there is no need of means or the using of them, when there is a
   certainty of the end, and an impossibility that it should otherwise
   fall out, or the end not be brought about and accomplished," as he did
   when he tempted him to cast himself headlong from a pinnacle of the
   temple, because the angels had charge over him, that not so much as his
   foot should be hurt against a stone, whatever he did, as Satan
   intimated, -- which is the tenor of the argument wherewith we have to
   do, -- he returns to him the very answer that we insist upon, namely,
   that though it be the good pleasure of God to bring us to the end we
   aim at, yet are we not to tempt him by a neglect of the means which he
   hath appointed. It is true, there are arguments used to us that could
   have no place with Christ, being taken from the estate and condition of
   infirmity and weakness through sin wherein we are; which is a ground
   only of an inference, that if Christ, who was "holy, harmless,
   undefiled, separate from sinners," did yet watch, and pray, and contend
   against Satan, much more should we do so. But this doth not at all take
   off from the parity of reason that is in the ease of diligent using of
   the means for the compassing of the end, that in some respect is under
   an impossibility of not being accomplished. For the removal of this
   instance, Mr Goodwin enters into a large discourse of the cause and
   reason, vesting the Lord Christ with an immutability in good, and how
   it is not competent to any creature; which that it is, never entered
   into the thoughts of any to assert that I ever heard of, nor is it of
   the least importance to the removal of our instance, as to its
   serviceableness unto the end for which it is produced. He tells us
   also, "That in ease men be caused necessitatingly and unavoidably to
   act righteously, it will take away all rewardableness from their
   actings; and the reason is, because such a necessitating of them makes
   them merely passive, they having not any internal principle of their
   own to contract such a necessity;" which discourse is pursued with many
   other words to the same purpose. And a discourse it is, --

   First, Exceeding irrelative to the business in hand. There is not any
   thing now under consideration that should minister occasion at all to
   consider the manner of our yielding obedience, and the way of God's
   grace in the bringing forth the fruits thereof; but only of the
   consistency that is between admonitions for the using of the means,
   when it is supposed impossible that the end prevented by them should
   ever come to pass, which may or may not be so, whatever be the manner
   and way of our yielding obedience, upon the exertion of the efficacy of
   the grace of God. Diversion is one of Mr Goodwin's ordinary ways of
   warding those blows which he is not able to bear.

   Secondly, False, charging a crime on the doctrine which he doth oppose
   whereof it is not guilty, neither it nor they that maintain it
   affirming that there is a necessitation upon the wills of men by the
   grace of God, such a necessitation as should in the least prejudice
   their freedom, or cause them to elicit their acts as principles natural
   and necessary. All the necessity ascribed by them to the efficacy of
   the operation of the grace of God respects only the event. They say it
   is necessary that the good be done which God works in us by his grace,
   when he works it in us; but for the manner of its doing, they say it is
   wrought suitably to the state and condition of the internal principle
   whence it is to proceed, and doth so, and of the agents whereby it is
   wrought, which are free. Neither do they say that good is not wrought
   by any native and inward principle that is in men, unless they will
   allow no principle to be native but what is in them by nature; and
   then, indeed, they say, that though naturally and physically there is,
   yet morally and spiritually there is not in them any native principle
   to that which is spiritually good, seeing in that sense "no good thing
   dwells in men." But if it may suffice to evince that they work from a
   native, inward principle, -- that their wills, which are their natural
   faculties, quickened, improved, and heightened, by inward, indwelling
   habits of grace, properly theirs when bestowed on them, are the
   principles of all their actings, -- then they assert them to work no
   less from a native, internal principle than Christ himself did. So that
   notwithstanding this diversion, given in to supply the absence of an
   answer, the instance, as to that wherein alone the parallel was
   intended, stands unmoved, and Mr Goodwin's whole charge of folly and
   inconsistency on the proceeding of the Holy Ghost falls to the ground;
   which is the issue of his eighth argument in this case. His last
   follows.

   The last argument which he proposeth, sect. 41, and ends his chapter
   withal, is faint, and, as the droppings after a shower, will easily be
   blown over. He thus proposeth it:--

   "That doctrine which naturally and directly tendeth to beget and foment
   jealousies and evil surmises between brethren in Christ, or such as
   ought cordially to love, reverence, and honour one another, is not
   confederate with the gospel, nor from God; and consequently that which
   contradicteth it must needs be a truth; -- the common doctrine of
   unquestionable and unconditional perseverance is a doctrine of this
   tendency, apt to beget and foment jealousies, suspicions, and evil
   surmises between brethren, or such as ought to love and respect one the
   other, as brethren in Christ: ergo."

   Ans. Not to take notice of any thing by-the-by, which sundry
   expressions, and one inference at the least, in this argument do
   readily administer occasion unto, I await the proof of the minor, which
   in the following discourse amounts to this: "That judging all those who
   fall finally away not to have been true believers, we cannot but have
   evil surmises of all that stand that they are not true believers,
   seeing as good as they have fallen away; hence jealousies of their
   hypocrisy will arise." And he tells us, for his part he knows no
   Christian in the world that he hath more reason to judge a true
   believer than he had to judge some who are turned wretched apostates.
   To which I say briefly, --

   1. I doubt not but Mr Goodwin knows full well that this is not a rule
   given us to make a judgment of believers by, with whom we walk, and
   towards whom it is required we bear "love without dissimulations" Rom.
   xii. 9, -- toward such as "show us their faith by their works." Our
   rule of walking, from the principle of love and charity, is laid down
   in 1 Cor. xiii. And if all that any man knows at this day to be
   professors in this world should turn apostates, save only one, and he
   had reckoned that one and them that are apostatized, before their
   apostasy, of the same rank of believers, and had had no evil thoughts
   of that one above the rest, he was hound, without any evil surmises,
   "to believe all things, and to hope all things," and not to let go his
   sincere love towards that one, embracing of him, delighting in him,
   holding communion with him to his life's end, without suspicion of
   hypocrisy, or other hard thoughts of him, unless he also should
   degenerate. It is said, John ii. 23, that "many believed on Christ,"
   because of the profession of faith that they made; and, chap. vi. 34,
   they pray earnestly to be fed with the bread of life, so that they were
   accounted among his disciples, verse 60, and yet upon a temptation they
   left our Saviour, and "walked no more with him," verse 66. Now,
   notwithstanding the profession of these men, our Saviour plainly says
   that they "believed not," verse 64. They falling thus away who had
   professed to believe, and were accounted as believers, so called and
   named among the disciples of Christ, and Christ declaring, on the
   account of their apostasy, that indeed they did never believe, how was
   it that the remaining twelve had not hard thoughts and jealousies one
   of another (especially considering that there was one hypocrite still
   left among them) whether they had true faith or no, seeing our Saviour
   had declared that those who so fell off, as those before mentioned, had
   none? Doubtless they were instructed to walk by a better and a straiter
   rule than that Mr Goodwin here assigns to believers. Let who will or
   can fall away, whilst we are taught of God to love one another, and are
   acted by the principle of love, which "thinketh no evil," and do
   contend against evil surmises as the works of the flesh, there is not
   any thing in the least attending the discovery of one man's hypocrisy,
   to work us to a persuasion that another (not in any thing discovered)
   is so also. That because we see some goodly house fall under storms and
   temptations to the ground, and so manifest itself to have been built on
   the sand, therefore we must conclude that those which stand are not
   built upon the rock, is not suited to any principle or rule that our
   Master hath given us to walk by, in order to the exercise of that love
   which he calleth for in us towards one another.

   2. I say this way of proceeding in our thoughts and judgments doth the
   Holy Ghost lead us to, 1 John ii. 19. The apostle giving an account of
   some who had formerly walked with him in the profession of the faith,
   and of the fellowship which they had with the Father and the Son, and
   fell away from Christ into an opposition against him, so far as to
   deserve the title of Antichrists, having not only forsaken the gospel,
   but making it also their business to oppose it, and to seduce others
   from the simplicity of the same; -- these, he informs the scattered
   believers of the Jews, were apostates, having formerly walked with
   them, but [who had] deserted their fellowship, and thereby manifested
   themselves never to have been true believers, nor ever, indeed, to have
   had fellowship with the Father and the Son, no more than they of whom
   our Saviour spake in the place before mentioned; and yet, doubtless,
   the apostle may not be supposed to lay a foundation for jealousies,
   evil suspicions, and surmises among believers, though he plainly and
   evidently affirms that those who fall away were never true believers,
   and that if they had been so, they would have continued in their faith
   and fellowship with the people of God. "They went out from us," saith
   he, "but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no
   doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be
   made manifest that they were not all of us." A passage, by the way,
   clearly confirming the main of the doctrine we have hitherto insisted
   on; and therefore I shall turn aside, before I come to the close of
   this chapter, having this occasion administered, to vindicate it from
   the exceptions Mr Goodwin gives in against the testimony it bears in
   this case.

   The argument that it readily furnisheth us withal is of this import:
   "If all they who fall away totally from the fellowship and society of
   the church and saints of God, whatever their profession were before
   that apostasy, were never true believers, and are thereby manifested
   never to have been so, then those who are true believers cannot fail
   away; but the first is true, therefore the latter." The words are so
   disposed as to be cast into an hypothetical proposition, which
   virtually includes a double argument, as every discreet axiom doth; --
   it is not thus, therefore thus. If true believers might so depart and
   apostatize as those here mentioned, no unquestionable proof could be
   drawn from such apostasy that men were never true believers; which yet
   is plainly insisted on in the text.

   Mr Goodwin, chap. x. sect. 21-24, pp. 189-192, gathers up sundry
   exceptions from the Remonstrants, which (as they also did) he opposeth
   to this interpretation of the words, and the inferences from them
   insisted on. I shall briefly consider and remove them in that order as
   by him they are laid down. He saith, --

   First, "This inference presumeth many things, for which neither it nor
   any of the authors of it will ever be able to give any good security of
   proof; as, --

   "First, That this phrase, They were not of us,' imports that they were
   never true believers. This certainly can never be proved, because there
   is another sense, and this every whit as proper to the words, and more
   commodious for the context and scope of the place, which may be given
   of them, as we shall see anon."

   Ans. That there is not any thing presumed for the eduction of the
   inference proposed but what is either directly expressed or evidently
   included in the words of the text, will appear in the farther
   consideration of what Mr Goodwin hath to offer to the contrary. That
   expression, "They were not of us," imports evidently that they were not
   of them in the fellowship and communion which he was now exhorting
   believers to continue and abide in. He tells them at the head of this
   discourse, chap. i. 3, that the end of his writing to them was to draw
   them into, and keep them in, communion with himself and the saints with
   him; which communion or "fellowship," be tells them, "they had with the
   Father and with his Son:" but as for the persons of whom in these words
   he is speaking to them, describing them by their former and present
   condition, with the causes of it, he tells them that though they abode
   with them for a season, yet they were never of them as to the communion
   and fellowship they had with the Father and Son; and so were never true
   members of the church. The only reason Mr Goodwin gives to invalidate
   this sense of the words is, that he is able to give another meaning of
   them, in his own judgment, "more proper to the words and more
   commodious to the scope of the place;" which whether it have any more
   efficacy to take off the force and evidence of the interpretation
   given, lying plain and clear in the first view of the words and
   context, than it hath to evade the eduction of any truth whatever from
   any place of Scripture whatever, seeing some or other suppose
   themselves able to give another sense of the words, let the reader
   judge. But he adds, --

   "Secondly, That this expression, They were of us,' signifies that they
   were true believers, is presumed. Of the uncertainty of this
   supposition we shall," saith he, "give the like account."

   Ans. When we come to take Mr Goodwin's farther account, we shall be
   able, I make no doubt, to reckon with him, and to discharge his bill.
   In the meantime, we say, that supposition, "If they had been of us"
   (whence our inference is made), evidently includes a fellowship and
   communion with the apostle and true believers in their fellowship with
   God; which is asserted as a certain foundation of men's abiding in the
   communion of the saints. But, says he, --

   "Thirdly, It is supposed that these words, They went out from us,'
   signify their final defection, or abdication of the apostle's
   communion, or their total and final renunciation of Christ, his church,
   and gospel. This supposition hath no bottom at all or colour for it."

   Ans. Divide not the words from their coherence and the intendment of
   the place, and the signification denied is too evident and clear for
   any one, with the least colour of reason, to rise up against it. "They
   went out," so out from the communion of the church, as to become
   antichrists, opposers of Christ, and seducers from him; and certainly
   in so doing did totally desert the communion of the apostle, renounce
   the Lord Christ as by him preached, and forsake utterly both church and
   gospel, as to any fellowship with the one or the other. And we know
   full well what is the bottom of this and the like assertions, "that
   such and such things have no bottom at all," which never yet failed Mr
   Goodwin in his need.

   "Fourthly," saith he, "It is supposed that this clause, They would no
   doubt have continued with us,' signifies They would have continued in
   the same faith wherein we persevere and continue. Nor is there," saith
   he, "any competent reason to enforce this sense of those words, because
   neither doth the grammatical tenor of them require it, and much less
   the scope of the passage."

   Ans. The fellowship John invited believers unto, and to continue in (as
   hath often been observed), with him and the saints, was that which they
   held with the Father and the Son. To continue with them therein, in the
   literal, grammatical sense of the words, is to continue in the faith,
   it being faith whereby they have that fellowship or communion. This
   also is evident from the scope of the whole passage, and is here only
   impotently denied. But, saith he, --

   "Fifthly, The said inference supposeth that John certainly knew that
   all those who for the present remained in his communion were true
   believers; for if they were not true believers, they that were gone out
   from them, in the sense contended for, might be said to be of them,'
   that is, persons of the same condition with them. But how improbable
   this is, I mean that John should infallibly know that all those who as
   yet continued with them were true believers, I refer to consideration."

   Ans. Had Mr Goodwin a little poised this passage before he took it up,
   perhaps he would have cast it away as a useless trifle; but, his
   masters having insisted on it, perhaps he thought it not meet to
   question their judgments in the least, for fear of being at liberty to
   deal so with them in matters of greater importance. I say, then, that
   there is not the least colour for any such supposal from the inference
   we make from the text, nor is there any thing of that nature intimated
   or suggested in the words, or argument from them. The body of them whom
   the apostates forsook were true believers, and their abiding in the
   fellowship of the saints was a manifestation of it, sufficient for them
   to be owned as such, which the others manifested themselves never to
   have been, by their apostasy. But, saith he, --

   "Sixthly, The inference under contest yet farther supposeth that John
   certainly knew that they who were now gone out from them neither were
   now, nor ever were before, true believers; yea, and that he certainly
   knew this by their departure or going out from them."

   Ans. This is the very thing that the apostle affirms, that he certainly
   knew those apostates never to have been true believers, and that by
   their apostasy or falling totally from the gospel, becoming seducers
   and opposers of Christ. Let him argue it out with the Holy Ghost if he
   can, whose plain and clear expression this is, and that confirmed by
   the ensuing argument of the perseverance of them who were true
   believers, and whose fellowship is with the saints, in their communion
   with the Father and the Son. Wherefore, saith he, --

   "Lastly, It presumeth yet farther, that all true believers do always
   abide in the external communion of the church; and that when men do not
   so abide, they plainly declare herein that they never were true
   believers; which is not only a manifest untruth, but expressly contrary
   to the doctrine itself of those men who assert the inference; for they
   teach (as we heard before) that a true believer may fall so foully and
   so far, that the church, according to the command of Christ, may be
   constrained to testify that she cannot tolerate them in her external
   communion, nor that ever they shall have any part or portion in the
   kingdom of Christ, unless they repent. Doubtless, to be cast out of the
   church, according to the institution and command of Christ (who
   commands no such thing but upon very heinous and high unchristian
   misdemeanours), is of every whit as sad importance as a voluntary
   desertion of the church's communion can be for a season."

   Ans. It supposeth that no true believers fall so off from the church as
   to become antichrists, opposers of Christ and the church, so as to deny
   that Christ is come in the flesh; which was the great business of the
   antichrists in those days. It is true, and granted by us, that a true
   believer may forsake the outward communion of some particular church
   for a season; yea, and that upon his irregular walking, and not
   according to the rule of Christ, he may, by the authority of such a
   church, be rejected from its communion, for his amendment and recovery
   into the right way (of which before): but that a true believer can
   voluntarily desert the communion of the saints, and become an
   antichrist, that this text denies, and we from it, and the many other
   witnesses of the same truth that have been produced.

   Notwithstanding, then, all Mr Goodwin's exceptions, there is nothing
   presumed in the inference we make from these words, but what is either
   expressly contained or evidently included in them.

   But Mr Goodwin will not thus give over. He prefers his exceptions to
   this testimony in another whole section; which, because the
   demonstration of the truth in hand from this place, though here handled
   by-the-by, is of great importance, and such as by its single strength
   is sufficient utterly to cast to the ground the figment set up in
   opposition to it, I shall present entirely to the reader, that our
   author may be heard out, and nothing omitted that he pleads for the
   waiving of the force of the argument in hand in that whole section.
   Thus, then, he proceeds:--

   "Suppose that these two suppositions be granted to the inference
   makers, first, that this phrase, To go out from us,' signifies
   voluntarily to forsake the society and communion of Christians; and,
   secondly, that this expression, To be of us,' signifies true and inward
   communion with those from whom they went out; yet will not these
   contributions suffice for the firm building of the said inference. The
   reason is, because the apostle expressly saith that They would have
   continued with us;' not that they would have continued such as they
   were, in respect of the truth or essence of their faith. And if the
   apostle's scope in this place were to prove or affirm that they who are
   once true Christians, or believers, always continue such, then, when he
   saith They would have continued with us,' he must of necessity mean
   either that They would have continued faithful as we continue
   faithful,' or else that They would have continued always in our
   society, or in the profession of Christianity.' But that neither of
   these senses is of any tolerable consistency is evident by the light of
   this consideration, namely, that the apostle then must have known that
   the persons he speaks of, and who went out from them, neither were nor
   ever had been true Christian believers, when they went thus from them.
   Now, if he had this knowledge of them, it must be supposed either that
   he had it by extraordinary revelation (but this is very improbable, and
   howsoever cannot be proved), or else that he gained and obtained it by
   their departure or going out from them: but that this could be no
   sufficient argument or ground to beget any such knowledge in the
   apostle concerning them is evident from hence, because it may very
   easily, and doth very frequently, come to pass that they who are true
   Christians do not always continue in the society to which they have
   joined themselves, no, nor yet in the external profession of
   Christianity itself; yea, our opposers themselves frequently, and
   without scruple, teach that even true believers themselves may, through
   fear, or shame, or extremity of sufferings, be brought to deny Christ,
   and, without any danger of being shipwrecked of their faith, forbear
   making a profession of the name of Christ afterward."

   Ans. 1. What is meant and intended by these expressions, "Went out from
   us," and "To be of us," hath been declared. We are not to teach the
   Holy Ghost to speak. Whatever conceit we may have of our own abilities,
   when we deal with worms of the earth like ourselves, to his will, to
   his expressions, we must vail and submit. He is pleased to phrase their
   continuance in the faith, their "Continuance with us;" that is, with
   the saints in the fellowship and communion of the gospel, which they
   had with God in Christ. The expression is clear and evident to the
   purpose in hand, and there is no contending against it.

   2. We do not say that it is the direct scope and intent of the apostle
   in this place to prove that those who are tree believers cannot fall
   away and depart from the faith, -- which he afterward doth to the
   purpose, chap. iii. 9; but his mind and intendment was, to manifest
   that those who forsake the society of Christians, and become
   antichrists and seducers, were indeed never true believers, using the
   other hypothesis as a medium for the confirmation of this assertion.

   3. By that phrase, "They would have continued with us," the apostle
   intends their continuance in the society and fellowship of the
   faithful, by the profession of Jesus Christ, whom now they opposed,
   denying him to be come in the flesh; that is, They would not have so
   fallen off as they have done, upon the account of the estate and
   condition of true believers and real saints, who are kept by the power
   of God to salvation.

   4. The apostle did know, and professed himself to know, that they were
   not, nor ever had been, true believers, when they were once so gone out
   from them as they went; as our Saviour Christ professed them not to
   have been true believers who followed him for a while, and were called
   and accounted his disciples, when they fell in an hour of temptation.
   Neither have we the least reason to suppose that the apostle had this
   knowledge by revelation, seeing the thing itself, in reference and
   proportion to the principles he lays down of the continuance of
   believers, did openly proclaim it.

   5. That true Christians, or believers, can so fall away from the
   society of the saints as those here mentioned did, is denied, and a
   grant of it ought not to be begged at our hands. It is true that (as
   was before granted) a true believer may for a season desert the
   communion or fellowship of a church wherein he hath walked, and that
   causelessly; yea, he may be surprised through infirmity to deny, under
   mighty temptations, in words, for a moment, the Lord Christ, whom yet
   his heart loves and honours, as in the case of Peter was too evident:
   but that such an one may forsake the external profession of
   Christianity, or cease profession-making, and betake himself to a
   contrary interest, opposing Christ and his ways, as those here insisted
   on did, that is denied, and not the least attempt of proof made to the
   contrary.

   Whilst I was upon consideration of these exceptions of Mr Goodwin's to
   our testimony from this text of Scripture by us insisted on, there came
   to my hands his exposition on the 9th chapter to the Romans; in the
   epistle whereof to the reader he is pleased, sect. 6, studiously to
   waive the imputation of having borrowed this exposition from Arminius
   and his followers, -- an apology perhaps unworthy his prudence and
   great abilities; which testimony yet, I fear, by having cast an eye on
   the body of the discourse, will scarcely be received by his reader
   without the help of that vulgar proverb, "Good wits jump." But yet on
   this occasion I cannot but say, however he hath dealt in that treatise,
   this discourse I have under consideration is purely translated from
   them, -- the condition of very much of what hath been already
   considered being the same; which I had then thought to have manifested
   by placing their Latin against his English in the margin. But these
   things are personal, not belonging to the cause in hand. Mr Goodwin is
   sufficiently known to have abilities of his own, such as wherewith he
   hath done, in sundry particulars, considerable service to the truth, --
   as sometimes they have been unhappily engaged in ways of a contrary
   nature and tendency.

   It being evident, from these considerations, that our author is not
   able in the least to take off this witness from speaking home to the
   very heart of the cause in hand, that it may not seem to be weakened
   and impaired by him in the least, I shall farther consider that
   diversion which he would entice the words unto from their proper
   channel and intendment, and so leave the apostasy of the saints dead at
   the foot of it. He gives us, then, sect. 23, 24, an exposition of this
   place of Scripture, upon the rack whereof it seems not to speak what
   formerly we received from its mouth. For the occasion of the words, he
   says, --

   "For the true meaning of this place, it is to be considered that the
   apostle's intent in the words was, to prevent or heal an offence that
   weak Christians might take by the doctrine which was taught and spread
   abroad by those antichrists or antichristian teachers spoken of in the
   former verse (and they are said to have been many); and that especially
   because they had sometimes lived and conversed with the apostles
   themselves in Christian churches, and had professed the same faith and
   doctrine with them. By reason hereof, some Christians, not so
   considerate or judicious as others, might possibly think or conceive
   that surely all things were not well with the apostles and those
   Christian societies with which they consorted, -- that there was
   something not as it ought to have been, either in doctrine or manners,
   or both, which ministered an occasion to these men to break communion
   with them and to leave them."

   Ans. 1. The intendment of the apostle in the context is evidently to
   caution believers against seducers; acquainting them also with the
   sweet and gracious provision that God had made for their preservation,
   in the abiding, teaching, anointing, bestowed on them. In the verse
   under present consideration he gives them a description of the persons
   that did seduce them, in respect of their present state and condition.
   They were apostates, who, though they had some time made profession of
   the faith, yet indeed were never true believers, nor had had any
   fellowship with Jesus Christ, as he and the saints had; which also they
   had abundantly manifested by their open apostasy, and ensuing
   opposition to the doctrine of the gospel and the eternal life
   manifested therein.

   2. That any Christians whatsoever, from the consideration of these
   seducers falling away, did entertain any suspicion that all things were
   not well in that society of which the apostle speaks (not with the
   "apostles," which were all dead, himself only excepted, when John wrote
   this epistle), either as to doctrine or manners, so supposing them to
   take part with the apostates in their departure, is a surmise whereunto
   there is not any thing in the least contributed in the text or context,
   nor any thing like to it, being a mere invention of our author, found
   out to serve his turn, and confidently, without any induction looking
   that way or attempt of proof, imposed upon his credulous reader. If men
   may assume to themselves a liberty of creating occasions of words,
   discourses, or expressions in the Scripture, no manner of way
   insinuated nor suggested therein, they may wrest it to what they
   please, and confirm whatever they have a mind unto.

   This false foundation being laid, he proceeds to build upon it; and,
   suitably thereunto, feigns the apostle to speak what never entered into
   his heart, and unto that whereof he had no occasion administered:--

   "To this," saith he, "the apostle answereth partly by concession,
   partly by exception. First, by concession, in these words, They went
   out from us;' which words do not so much import their utter declining
   or forsaking the apostles' communion, as the advantage or opportunity
   which they had to gain credit and respect both to their doctrine and
   persons among professors of Christianity in the world, inasmuch as they
   came forth from the apostles themselves, as men sent and commissioned
   by them to teach. The same phrase is used in this sense, and with the
   same import, where the apostles write thus to the brethren of the
   Gentiles: Acts xv. 24, Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which
   went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
   saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no
   such commandment.' So that in this clause, They went out from us,' the
   apostle grants, first, That those antichristian teachers had indeed for
   a time held communion with them; and secondly, That hereby they had the
   greater opportunity of doing harm in the world by their false
   doctrines. But secondly, he answers farther by way of exception, But
   they were not of us;' -- Whilst yet they conversed with us, they were
   not men of the same spirit and principles with us. We walked in the
   profession of the gospel with single and upright hearts, not aiming at
   any singular greatness or worldly accommodations in one kind or other;
   these men loved this present world, and when they found the simplicity
   of the gospel would not accommodate them to their minds, they brake
   with us and with the truth of the gospel itself at Once."

   Ans. 1. I suppose it is evident, at the first view, that this new gloss
   on the apostle's words is inconsistent with that which was proposed for
   the occasion of them in the words foregoing. There, an aspersion is
   said to be cast upon the churches and societies whereof the apostle
   speaks, from the departure of these seducers from them, as though they
   were not sound in faith or manners; here, an insinuation quite of
   another tendency is suggested, -- as though these persons found
   countenance in their teachings and seductions from the society and
   communion which they had had with the apostles, -- as though they had
   pretended to come from them by commission, and so, instead of casting
   reproach upon them by their departure, did assume authority to
   themselves by their having been with them. But to the thing itself I
   say, --

   2. That the apostle is not answering any objection, but describing the
   state and condition of the antichrists and seducers, concerning whom
   and their seduction he cautioneth believers, hath been formerly, beyond
   contradiction, manifested and maintained. That expression, then, "They
   went out from us," is not an answer, "by concession," to an objection,
   but a description of seducers by their apostasy; which words, also, in
   their regard to the persons as before by him described, do manifest
   their utter declining and forsaking the communion of the saints, they
   so going from them as also to go into an opposition to the doctrine of
   the gospel.

   3. That the apostle here insinuates an advantage these antichrists had
   to seduce, from their former communion with him (a thing not in the
   least suggested, as was observed, in the occasion of the words as laid
   down by Mr Goodwin himself), is proved from the use of the words, "They
   went out from us," Acts xv. 24; whence this undeniable argument may be
   educed, "Some who went out from the apostles had repute and authority
   in their preaching thereby; these antichrists went out from the
   apostle: therefore they had repute and authority thereby!" Younger men
   than either Mr Goodwin or myself know well enough what to make of this
   argument. Besides, though there be an agreement in that one expression,
   all the neighbouring parts of the description manifest that in the
   things themselves there and here pointed at there is no affinity. Those
   in the Acts pretended to abide still in the "communion and faith of the
   apostles;" these here expressly departed both from the one and the
   other, to an opposition of them both. The former seemed to have
   pretended a commission from the apostles; these, according to Mr
   Goodwin himself, did so far declare against them that it was "a scandal
   to some, fearing that all had not been well among the apostles."

   4. That which is called "an answer by way of exception," as it lies,
   the expression of it so used upon the matter is as much as we urge from
   these words. The import of them is said to be, "?They were not of us.'
   Though they were with us, yet they were not such as we are, did not
   walk in that uprightness of heart as we do; they were not men of the
   same principles and spirit with us;" -- that is, they were not true,
   thorough, sincere, and sound believers at all, no, not while they
   conversed with the apostle. Now, evident it is that in those words, --
   as is manifest by the resuming of them again for the use of an
   inference ensuing, "For if they had been of us, they would have
   continued with us," -- the apostle yields a reason and account how they
   came to apostatize and fall to the opposition of the gospel from the
   profession wherein they walked; it was because they were not men of
   thorough and sound principles, true believers: and consequently he
   supposeth and implieth that if they had been so, they would not, they
   could not, have so apostatized; for if they might, there had been no
   weight in the account given of the reason of their revolt.

   In what follows, "That these words, But they were not of us,' do not
   necessarily imply they were believers formerly, but perhaps they had
   been so, and were before fallen away, being choked by the cares of the
   world," an observation is insinuated directly opposite to the apostle's
   design, and such as makes his whole discourse ridiculous. An account he
   gives of men's falling away from the faith, and he tells them it is
   because, though they had been professors, yet they were never true
   believers. "Yea, but perhaps they were true believers and then fell
   away, and after that fell away;" -- that is, they fell from the faith,
   and then fell from the faith; for that is plainly intimated in and is
   the sense of this doughty observation.

   But to proceed with his exposition, he says, "It follows, For if they
   had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.' In these
   words the apostle gives a reason of his exception, telling them to whom
   he writes that this was a sign and argument that those antichristian
   teachers were not of them in the sense declared, namely, that they did
   not continue with them; that is, they quitted their former intimacy and
   converse with the apostles, refused to steer the same course, to walk
   by the same principles, any longer with them: which,' saith he,
   doubtless they would not have done had they been as sincerely affected
   towards Jesus Christ and the gospel as we.' By which assertion John
   plainly vindicated himself and the Christian churches of his communion
   from giving any just occasion of offence unto those men, whereby they
   should be any ways induced to forsake them, and resolves their unworthy
   departure of this kind into their own carnal and corrupt hearts, which
   lusted after some fleshly accommodations and contentments that were not
   to be obtained or enjoyed in a sincere profession of the gospel with
   the apostles, and those who were perfect of heart with them."

   Ans. First, that no aspersion was cast on John or the "churches of his
   communion" by the apostasy of the antichrists of whom he speaks, from
   which he should need to vindicate himself and them, was before
   declared. There was not, indeed, nor possibly could be, the least
   occasion for any surmise of evil concerning them from whom men departed
   in turning ungodly opposers of Christ. For any thing that is here
   offered, it is but an obscuring of the light that breaks forth from the
   words for the discerning of the truth in hand. It is granted that the
   apostle manifests that "they were not of them," -- that is, true,
   uptight, sound believers, that walked with a tight foot in the doctrine
   of the gospel, -- because they forsook the communion of the saints to
   fall into the condition of antichristianism, wherein they were now
   engaged. Now, if this be an argument that a man was never a true
   believer, in the highest profession that he makes, because he falls
   from it and forsakes it, certainly those that are true believers cannot
   so fall from their steadfastness, or the argument will be of no
   evidence or conviction at all; neither is any thing here offered by Mr
   Goodwin but what, upon a thorough consideration, doth confirm the
   inferences we insist upon, and make to the work in hand. Truth will, at
   one time or other, lead captive those who are most skilful in their
   rebellion against it.

   What is added, sect. 24, concerning the righteous judgment of God, and
   the gracious tendency of his dispensations to his church's rise, in
   suffering these wretches so to discover themselves, and to manifest
   what they were, I oppose not. The discovery that was made was of what
   they had been before, -- that is, not true believers, -- and not what
   now they were; yea, by what they now showed themselves to be was made
   manifest what before they were. Words of the like import you have, 1
   Cor. xi. 19, "For there must be also heresies among you, that they
   which are approved may be made manifest among you." As here those who
   fall away are manifested to be corrupt, so there those who abide are to
   be sincere.

   From what hath been occasionally spoken of the intendment and scope of
   this place, of the design which the apostle had in hand, of the direct
   sense of the words themselves, -- Mr Goodwin's exceptions to our
   interpretation of the words and inferences from it being wholly
   removed, and his exposition, which he advanceth in the room of that
   insisted on, manifested to be, as to the occasion and scope of the
   place assigned, utterly foreign unto it, and, as to explication of the
   particulars of it, not of any strength or consistency for the obscuring
   of the true sense and meaning of the place, in the eye of an
   intelligent reader, -- it is evidently concluded, beyond all colourable
   contradiction, that those who are true believers indeed, having
   obtained communion with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, cannot
   fall into a total relinquishment of Christ or of the faith of the
   gospel, so as to have no portion nor interest in the communion they
   formerly enjoyed.

   To return to Mr Goodwin's close of this 13th chapter, and "nine
   arguments," as he calls them, from which he labours to evince the
   apostasy of believers, he shuts up the whole with a declamation against
   and reviling of the doctrine he opposeth, with many opprobrious and
   reproachful expressions, calling it "an impostor, and an appearance of
   Satan in the likeness of an angel of light," with such like terms of
   reproach as his rhetoric at every turn is ready to furnish him withal,
   threatening it farther with calling it in question before I know not
   how many learned men of all sorts, and to disprove it by their
   testimony concerning it; and so all that is required for its
   destruction is, or shall be, speedily despatched! God knows how to
   defend his truth; and as he hath done this in particular against as
   fierce assaults as any Mr Goodwin hath made or is like to make against
   it, so I no way doubt he will continue to do. It is not the first time
   that it hath been conformable to its Author, in undergoing the
   contradiction of men, and being laden with reproaches, and crucified
   among the thievish principles of error and profaneness. Hitherto it
   hath not wanted, in due time, its resurrection, and that continually
   with a new glory and an added estimation to what before it obtained
   among the saints of God; and I no way doubt but that it will grow more
   and more until the perfect day, when those opinions and inventions of
   men, derogatory to the grace and covenant of God, his truth,
   unchangeableness, and faithfulness, which now make long their shades to
   eclipse the beauty and lustre of it shall consume and vanish away
   before its brightness; -- in which persuasion I doubt not but the
   reader will be confirmed with me, upon the farther consideration of
   what Mr Goodwin's endeavours are in opposition hereto, wherewith now,
   by the grace of God, contrary to my first intendment, I shall proceed.

   Though I could willingly be spared the labour of all that must ensue to
   the end of this treatise, yet, it being made necessary by the
   endeavours of men not delighting in the truth which hitherto we have
   asserted for the opposition thereof, and lying, I hope, under the power
   and efficacy of that heavenly exhortation of "contending earnestly for
   the faith once delivered to the saints," I shall with all cheerfulness
   address myself thereunto; yea, the service and homage I owe to the
   truth itself, causing this engagement for its rescue from under the
   captivity wherein by the chains of Mr Goodwin's rhetoric it hath been
   some time detained, being increased and doubled by the pressing and
   violent wresting of sundry texts of Scripture to serve in the same
   design of bondaging the truth with him, is a farther incitation to add
   my weak endeavours to break open those doors and bars which he hath
   shut and fastened upon them both, for their joint deliverance.

   In Mr Goodwin's 12th chapter, he takes into participation with him, as
   is pretended, eight places of Scripture, endeavouring by all means
   possible to compel them to speak comfortable words for the relief of
   his fainting and dying cause. Whether he hath prevailed with them to
   the least compliance, or whether he will not be found to proclaim in
   their name what they never once acknowledged unto him, will be tried
   out in the process of our consideration of them.

   In the first and second sections he fronts the discourse intended with
   an eloquent oration, partly concerning the tendency of the doctrine of
   the saints' perseverance, which he girds himself now more closely to
   contend withal, partly concerning himself, his own ability, industry,
   skill, diligence, and observation of doctrines and persons, with his
   rules in judging of the one and the other.

   For the first, he informs us that his judgment is, "That many who might
   have attained a crown of glory,' by a presumptuous conceit of the
   impossibility of their miscarrying, are now like to suffer the
   vengeance of eternal fire;' men thereby gratifying the flesh with
   wresting the Scriptures to the encouragement thereof."

   That the proud and presumptuous conceits of men are like to have no
   other issue or effect than the betraying of their souls to all manner
   of looseness and abominations, so exposing them to the "vengeance of
   eternal fire," we are well assured; and therefore, "knowing the terror
   of the Lord, we do persuade men," what we are able, to cast down all
   high thoughts and imaginations concerning their own abilities to do
   good, to believe, to obey the gospel, or to abide in the faith thereof,
   and to roll themselves freely, fully, wholly, on the free grace and
   faithfulness of God in the covenant of mercy, ratified in the blood of
   his Son, wherein they shall be assured to find peace to their soul. On
   this foundation do we build all our endeavours for the exalting the
   sovereign, free, effectual grace of God, in opposition to the proud and
   presumptuous conceits of men concerning their own inbred, native power
   in spiritual things, -- an apprehension whereof, we are well assured,
   disposeth the heart into such a frame as God abhors, and prepares the
   soul to a battle against him, in the highest and most abominable
   rebellion imaginable. I no ways doubt that the ways and means whereby
   innumerable poor creatures have been hardened to their eternal ruin
   have had all their springs and fountains lie in this one wretched
   reserve, of a power in themselves to turn to God and to abide with him.
   That any one by mixing the promises of God with faith, wherein the Lord
   hath graciously assured him, that, seeing he hath no strength in
   himself to continue in his mercy, he will preserve and keep him in and
   through the Son of his love, hath ever been, or ever can be, turned
   wholly aside to any way or path not acceptable to God, or not ending in
   everlasting peace, will never be made good, whilst the gospel of Christ
   finds honour and credit amongst any of the sons of men. There may be
   some, indeed, who are strangers to the covenant of promise, whatever
   they do pretend, who may turn this grace of God in the gospel, as also
   that of the satisfaction of Christ, redemption by his blood, and
   justification by faith, the whole doctrine of the covenant of grace in
   Christ, into lasciviousness. But shall their unbelief make the faith of
   God of none effect? shall their wickedness and rebellion prejudice the
   mercy, peace, and consolation of the saints? Because the gospel is to
   them the "savour of death unto death," may it not be the "savour of
   life unto life" unto them that do embrace it? Whatever, then, be the
   disasters of men (of which themselves are the sole cause) with their
   presumptuous conceits of the impossibility of miscarrying, -- seeing
   every presumptuous conceit, of what kind soever, is a desperate
   miscarriage, -- their ruin and destruction cannot in the least be
   ascribed to that doctrine which calls for faith in the promises of God,
   a faith working by love, and decrying all presumptuous conceits
   whatever; a doctrine without which, and the necessary concomitant
   doctrines thereof, the whole bottom of men's walking with God, and of
   their obedience, is nothing but presumption and conceit, whereby,
   setting aside the cold fits they are sometimes cast into by the checks
   of their consciences, they spend their days in the distemper of a fever
   of pride and folly.

   In the ensuing discourse, Mr Goodwin informs us of these two things:--
   First, What rule he proceeds by in judging of the truth of contrary
   opinions, when, as he phraseth it, "the tongue of the Scripture seems
   to be cloven about them." And, Secondly, Of his own advantages and
   abilities to make a right judgment according to that rule. The rule he
   attends unto, upon the information he hath given us, is, "The
   consideration of which of the opinions that are at any time rivals for
   his judgment and acceptation tends most unto godliness, the gospel
   being the truth which is according to godliness." Of his own advantages
   and abilities to make a right judgment according to this rule, there
   are several heads and springs; as, "his knowledge of the general course
   of the Scripture, the experience of his own heart, his long observation
   of the spirits and ways of men, but chiefly that light of reason and
   understanding which he hath." And by this rule, with these abilities,
   proceeding in the examination of the doctrine of the saints'
   perseverance, he condemns it, and casts it out as an abominable thing,
   preferring that concerning their final defection far above it. Some
   considerations I shall add to attend upon his rule and principles:--

   First, it is most certain that the gospel is a "doctrine according unto
   godliness," whose immediate and direct tendency, as in the whole frame
   and course of it, so in every particular branch and stream, is to
   promote that obedience to God in Christ which we call godliness. "This
   is the will of God," revealed therein, "even our sanctification." And
   whatever doctrine it be that is suited to turn men off from walking
   with God in that way of holiness, it carries its brand on its face?
   whereby every one that finds it may know that it is of the unclean
   spirit, the evil one; But yet that there may be fearful and desperate
   deceits in the hearts of men judging of truths, pretending their rise
   and original from the gospel by their suitableness to the promotion of
   godliness and holiness, hath been before in part declared, and the
   experience of all ages doth sufficiently manifest. Among all those who
   profess the name of Christ more or less in the world, though in and
   under the most antichristian opposition to him, who is there that doth
   not pretend that this tendency of opinions unto godliness, or their
   disserviceableness thereunto, hath a great influence into the guidance
   of their judgment in the receiving or rejecting of them? On the account
   of its destructiveness to godliness and obedience do the Socinians
   reject the satisfaction and merit of Christ; and on the account of
   conducingness thereunto do the Papists assert and build up the
   doctrines of their own merits, penance, satisfaction, and the like. On
   that principle did they seem to be acted who pressed legal and judicial
   suppositions, with "a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and
   neglecting of the body," Col. ii. 23. Neither did they fail of their
   plea concerning promotion of godliness in the worship of God, who
   reviled, rejected, and persecuted the ordinances of Christ in this
   generation, to set up their own abominations in their room. Yea, it is
   generally the first word wherewith every abomination opens its mouth in
   the world, though the men of those abominations do rather suppose this
   pretence of godliness to be serviceable for the promotion of their
   opinions than their opinions any way really useful to the promotion of
   godliness.

   Neither need we go far to inquire after the reasons of men's
   miscarriages, pretending to judge of truth according to this rule,
   seeing they lie at hand, and are exposed to the view of all; for
   besides that very many of the pretenders to this plea may be justly
   suspected to be men of corrupt minds, dealing falsely and treacherously
   with their own souls and the truth, -- the pretence of furthering
   holiness being one of the cunning sleights wherewith they lie in wait
   to deceive, which may justly be suspected of them who, together with
   this plea, and whilst they make it, are apparently themselves loose and
   remote from the power of a gospel conversation, as the case hath been
   with not a few of the most eminent assertors of Arminianism, -- how few
   are there in the world who have indeed a true notion and apprehension
   of the nature of holiness in its whole compass and extent, as in the
   fountain, causes, rise, use, and end thereof! And if men know not
   indeed what holiness is, how shall they judge what doctrine or opinion
   is conducing to the furtherance thereof or is obstructive to it?

   Give me a man who is persuaded that he hath power in himself being by
   the discovery of a rule directed thereunto, to yield that obedience to
   God which he doth require; who supposeth that threats of hell and
   destruction are the greatest and most powerful and effectual motive
   unto that obedience; that the Spirit and grace of God to work and
   create a new heart in him, as a suitable principle of all holy actings,
   are not purchased nor procured for him by the blood of Christ, nor is
   there any holiness wrought in him by the almighty efficacy of that
   Spirit and grace, he having a sufficiency in himself for these things;
   that there is not a real physical concurrence of the grace of God for
   the production of every good act whatever; and that he is justified
   upon the account of any act or part of his obedience or of the whole,
   -- and I shall not be much moved or shaken with the judgment of that
   man concerning the serviceableness and suitableness of any doctrine or
   doctrines to the furtherance of godliness and holiness. There are also
   many different opinions about the nature of godliness, what it is, and
   wherein it doth consist. I desire to be informed how a man may be
   directed in his examination of those opinions, supposing him in a
   strait and exigency of thoughts between them, in considering which of
   them is best suited to the promotion of godliness. I do not intend in
   the least to derogate from the certain and undoubted truth of what was
   premised at the beginning of this discourse, namely, "That every gospel
   rule whatever is certainly conducing to the furtherance of gospel
   obedience in them that receive it in the love and power thereof," every
   error being in its utmost activity (especially in corrupting the
   principles of it) obstructive thereunto; much less do we in any measure
   decline the trim of the doctrine which I assert, in opposition to [the
   doctrine of] the apostasy of the saints, by this touchstone of its
   usefulness to holiness, having formerly manifested its eminent activity
   and efficacy in that service, and the utter averseness of its corrival
   to lend any assistance thereunto. But yet I say, in an inquiry after
   and dijudication of truth, whatever I have been or may be straitened
   between different persuasions, I have [chosen], and shall rather
   choose, in the practice of holiness, in prayer, faith, and waiting upon
   God, to search the Scripture, to attend wholly to that rule, having
   plentiful promises for guidance and direction, than to weigh in any
   rational consideration of my own what is conducing to holiness, what
   not, especially in many truths which have their usefulness in this
   service (as is the case of most gospel ordinances and institutions of
   worship), not from the connection of things, but from the mere will of
   the Appointer. Of those doctrines, I confess, which, following on to
   know the Lord, we know from his word to be from him, and which in doing
   the will of Christ are revealed to us to be his will, a peculiar
   valuation is to be set on the head of them which appear to be
   peculiarly and eminently serviceable to the promotion and furthering of
   our obedience; as also, that all opinions whatever that are in the
   least seducers from the power, truth, and spirituality of obedience,
   are not of God, and are eo nomine to be rejected: yet, having a more
   sure rule to attend unto, I dare not make my apprehensions concerning
   the tendency of doctrines any rule, if God hath not so spoken of them,
   for the judging of their truth or falsehood, if my thoughts are not
   shut up and determined by the power of the word.

   The next proposal made by Mr Goodwin is of the advantages he hath to
   judge of truths; which he hath done unto plenary satisfaction,
   according to the rule now considered. The first thing he offereth to
   induce us to close with him in his judgment of opinions is, "the
   knowledge he hath of the general course of the Scripture." What is
   intended by "the general course of the Scripture" well I know not; and
   so I am not able to judge of Mr Goodwin's knowledge thereof by any
   thing exposed to public view. If by "the general course of the
   Scriptures" the matter of them is intended, the importance of the
   expression seems to be coincident with the "analogy or proportion of
   faith," a safe rule of prophecy; -- but whatever Mr Goodwin's knowledge
   may be of this, I am not perfectly satisfied that he hath kept close
   unto it in many doctrines of his book entitled "Redemption Redeemed;"
   and so the weight of his skill in judging of truths on this foundation
   will not balance what I have to lay against it for the inducement of
   other thoughts than those of closing with him. The "course of the
   Scripture" cannot import the manner of the expressions therein used, in
   that there is so great and so much variety therein that it can scarce
   be cast into one course and current; and if the general scope, aim, and
   tendency of the Scripture may pass for the "course of it," there is not
   any one thing that lies so evident and clear therein as the decrying of
   all that ability, and strength, and power to do good in men, which Mr
   Goodwin so much pleads for and asserts to be in them, with an
   exaltation of that rich and free grace, in the efficacy and the power
   of it, which he so much opposeth.

   The "experimental knowledge he hath of his own heart, the workings and
   reasonings thereof," a thing common to him with others, and what
   advantages he hath thereby, I shall not consider; only, this I shall
   dare to say, that I would not for all the world have no experience in
   my heart of the truth of many things which Mr Goodwin in this treatise
   opposeth, or that my weak experience of the grace of God should not
   rise above that frame of heart and spirit which the teachings of it
   seem to discover. I doubt not, a person under the covenant of works,
   heightened with convictions, and a low or common work of the Spirit,
   induced thereby to some regular walking before God, may reach the
   utmost of what in this treatise is required to render a man a saint,
   truly gracious, regenerate, and a believer.

   And in this also, I doubt not, lies the deceit of what is thirdly
   insisted on, namely, "his observation of the ways and spirits of men,
   their firstings and lastings in religion." A sort of men there are in
   the world who escape the outward pollution of it, and are clean in
   their own eyes, though they are never washed from their iniquities; who
   having been under strong convictions by the power of the law, and
   broken [off] thereby from the course of their sin, attending to the
   word of the gospel with a temporary faith, do go forth unto a
   profession of religion and walking with God so far as to have "all the
   lineaments of true believers," as Mr Goodwin somewhere speaks, "drawn
   in their faces," -- hearing the word gladly, as did Herod; receiving it
   with joy, as did the stony ground; attending to it with delight, as
   they did in Ezek. xxxiii. 31; repenting of former sins, as did Ahab and
   Judas; until they are reckoned among true believers, as was Judas and
   those in John ii. 23, who yet were never united unto Jesus Christ; --
   of whose ways and walking Mr Goodwin seems to have made observation,
   and found many of them to end in visible apostasy. But that this
   observation of them should cause him to judge them, when apostatized,
   to have been true believers, or that he is thereby advantaged to
   determine concerning the truth of several opinions pretending to his
   acceptance, I cannot grant, nor doth he go about to prove.

   For what he mentions in the last place, of the "light of reason and
   understanding" which he hath, I do not only grant him to have it "in
   common," as he saith, "with other men," for the kind of it, but also,
   as to the degrees of it, to be much advanced therein above the
   generality of men; yet I must needs tell him, in the close, that all
   these helps and advantages, seeming to be drawn forth and advanced in
   opposition to that one great assistance, which we enjoy by promise of
   Christ, of his Spirit leading us into all truth, and teaching us from
   God by his own anointing, are to me "hay and stubble," yea, "loss and
   dung," -- of no value or esteem. Had we not other ways and means, helps
   and advantages, to come to the knowledge of the truth, than these here
   unfolded and spread forth by Mr Goodwin, actum esset, we should never
   perceive the things that are of God. The fox was acquainted with many
   wiles and devices; the cat knew unum magnum, wherein she found safety.
   Attendance to the word, according to the direction of the usual known
   rules and helps agreed on for the interpretation of it, with humble
   dependence on God; waiting for the guidance of his Spirit, according to
   the promise of his dear Son; asking him of him continually, that he may
   dwell with us, anoint, and lead us into all truth; with an utter
   abrenunciation of all our skill, abilities, wisdom, and any resting on
   them, knowing that it is God alone that gives us understanding, -- is
   the course that hitherto hath been used in our inquiry after the mind
   of God in the doctrine under consideration, and which, the Lord
   assisting, shall be heeded and kept close unto in that discussion of
   the texts of Scripture wrested by Mr Goodwin, as by others before him,
   to give countenance to his opposition to the truth hitherto uttered,
   confirmed, and vindicated from his contradictions thereunto.

   The place of Scripture first insisted on, and on the account whereof he
   triumphs with the greatest confidence of success, is that of Ezek.
   xviii. 24, 25; unto which words he subjoins a triumphant, exulting
   exclamation:--

   "What more," saith he, "can the understanding, judgment, soul, and
   conscience of a man reasonably desire, for the establishment in any
   truth whatsoever, than is delivered by God himself in this passage, to
   evince the possibility of a righteous man's declining from his
   righteousness, and that unto death?"

   The counsel given of old to the king may not be unseasonable to Mr
   Goodwin, in that dominion which he exerciseth in his own thoughts in
   this work of his, "Let not him that putteth on his armour boast like
   him that putteth it off." You have but newly entered the lists, and
   that with all pressed soldiers, unwilling so much as once to appear in
   that service they are forced to. If you will but suspend your triumph
   until we have made a little trial of your forces, and your skill in
   managing of them to the battle, perhaps you may be a little taken off
   from this confidence of success. Notwithstanding the forcing of this
   scripture upon the truth, being cut off and taken away from that
   coherence, and connection, and station, wherein it is placed of God
   (which is not in the least inquired into), it will be found in the
   issue to bear it no ill-will at all, as will also be manifested by the
   light of the ensuing considerations:--

   1. The matter under inquiry, and into a disquisition of whose state we
   have hitherto been engaged, is the condition of the saints of God, and
   his dealing with them in and under the covenant of grace in general.
   For our guidance and direction herein, a text of Scripture, evincing
   the righteousness of God's dealings with a number of persons, in a
   peculiar case which was under debate, is produced; and by the tenor of
   this, and according to the tenor of the reasonings therein, must all
   the promises of God in the covenant of grace, made and ratified by the
   blood of Christ, be regulated and interpreted! We have been told, by as
   learned a man as Mr Goodwin, "That promises made to the people of the
   Jews peculiarly, and suited to the peculiar state and condition wherein
   they were, do not concern the people of God in general;" and why may
   not the same be the condition of threatenings given out upon a parallel
   account? "Compedes quas fecit ipse ut ferat æquum est."

   2. That it is the determination and stating of a particular controversy
   between God and the people of the Jews, suited to a peculiar
   dispensation of his providence towards them, which is here proposed, is
   evident from the occasion of the words, laid down verses 2, 3, "What
   mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel,
   saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth
   are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God," etc. It is the use of
   a proverb concerning the land of Israel that God is decrying, and
   disproving the truth of the proverb itself under consideration; and
   that this should be the standard and rule of God's proceeding with his
   people in the covenant of mercy, no man that seems to have either
   understanding, judgment, or conscience, can reasonably imagine.

   3. That it is not the nature and tenor of the covenant of grace, and
   God's dealing with his chosen secret ones, his saints, true believers,
   as to their eternal condition, which in these words is intended, but
   the manifestation of the righteousness of God in dealing with that
   people of the Jews, in a peculiar dispensation of his providence
   towards the body of the people and the nation in general, appears
   farther from the occasion of the words and the provocation given the
   Lord to make use of those expressions unto them. The proverb that God
   cuts out Of their lips and mouths by the sword of his righteousness in
   those words was "concerning the land of Israel;" used perhaps mostly by
   them in captivity. But it was concerning the land of Israel, not
   concerning the eternal state and condition of the saints of God, but
   concerning the land of Israel, verse 2. God had of old given that land
   to that people by promise, and continued them in it for many
   generations, until at length, for their wickedness, idolatry,
   abomination, and obstinacy in their evil ways, he caused them to be
   carried captive unto Babylon. In that captivity the Lord revenged upon
   them not only the sins of the present generation, but, as he told them,
   also those of their forefathers; especially the abomination, cruelty,
   idolatry, exercised in the days of Manasseh, taking this season for his
   work of vengeance on the generations following, who also so far walked
   in the steps of their forefathers as to justify all God's proceedings
   against them. Being wasted and removed from their own land by the
   righteous judgment of God, they considered the land of Israel, that was
   promised to them (though upon their good behaviour therein), and how,
   instead of a plentiful enjoyment of all things in peace and quietness
   therein, there were now a small remnant in captivity, the rest, the far
   greatest part, being destroyed by the sword and famine in that land. In
   this state and condition, being, as all others of their frame and
   principle, prone to justify themselves, they had hatched a proverb
   among themselves concerning the land of Israel promised to them,
   exceedingly opprobrious and reproachful to the justice of God in his
   dealings with them. The sum of the intendment of this saying that was
   grown rife amongst them was, that for the sins of their forefathers,
   many, yea, the greatest part of them, were slain in the land of Israel,
   and the rest carried from it into bondage and captivity. To vindicate
   the righteousness and equity of his ways, the impartiality of his
   judgments, the Lord recounts to them by his prophet many of their sins,
   whereof themselves with their fathers were guilty, in the land of their
   nativity, and for which he had brought all that calamity and desolation
   upon them whereof they did complain; alarming, under many supposals of
   rising and falling, that principle of rising and falling, that
   principle he laid down in the entrance of his dealings with them, --
   that every one of them suffered for his own iniquity, whatever they
   suffered, whether death or other punishment, and not for the sins of
   their forefathers, whatever influence they might have upon the
   procuring of the general vengeance that overtook the whole nation in
   the midst of their iniquity. This being the aim, scope, and tendency of
   the place, the import of the words and tenor of God's intendment in
   them, I cannot but wonder how any man of understanding and conscience
   can once imagine that God hath given any testimony to the possibility
   of falling out of covenant with him of those whom he hath taken nigh to
   himself through the blood of his Son in the everlasting bond thereof;
   as though it were any thing of his dealing with the saints in reference
   to their spiritual and eternal condition that the Lord here reveals his
   will about, being only the tenor of his dealings with the house of
   Israel in reference to the land of Canaan.

   4. This is farther manifest in that principle and rule of God's
   proceedings in the matter, laid down verse 4; which is not only alien
   from, but also directly opposite unto, that which is the principle in
   the covenant of grace, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die," -- that
   soul and person, and not another, -- when in that covenant of grace he
   "setteth forth his Son to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,
   giving him up to death for all, causing the just to die for the
   unjust," the soul that never sinned for the souls that had sinned, that
   they might go free. And I would fain know on what solid grounds an
   answer may be given to the Socinians' triumphing in the 4th verse
   against the satisfaction of Christ, no less than Mr Goodwin in the 24th
   and 25th, against the perseverance of the saints, if you do not
   manifest the whole tendency of this place to be accommodated to God's
   providential dispensation of temporal judgments and mercies in respect
   of that people and the covenant whereby they held the land of Canaan,
   and not at all to respect the general dispensation of his righteousness
   and grace in the blood of Christ. So that, --

   5. The whole purport and intendment of the scripture under
   consideration is only to manifest the tenor of God's righteous
   proceeding with the people of Israel, in respect of his dispensation
   towards them in reference to the land of Canaan. Convincing them of
   their own abominations, confuting the profane proverb invented and
   reared up in the reproach of his righteousness, beating them from the
   vain pretence of being punished for their fathers' sins, and from the
   conceit of their own righteousness, which that people was perpetually
   puffed up withal, he lets them know that his dealing with them and his
   ways towards them were equal and righteous, in that there was none of
   them but was punished for his own sin; and though some of them might
   have made some profession and done some good, yet upon the whole
   matter, first or last, they had all declined, and therefore ought to
   own the punishment of their sins, God dealing severely, and unto death
   and destruction, with none but those who either wholly or upon the sum
   of the matter turned away from his judgments and statutes. So that, --

   6. This being the tenor and importance of the words insisted on, this
   their tendency, aim, and accommodation to the objection levied against
   the righteousness of God in dealing with that people, this their rise
   and end, their spring and fall, it is evident beyond all contradiction,
   front any thing but prejudice itself, that all the inquiries and
   disputes about them, -- as, whether the declaration of the mind of God
   in them be hypothetical or absolute, what is meant by the righteous
   person, what by his turning away, and what by the death threatened (all
   which expressions of the text are in themselves ambiguous, and must be
   limited from the circumstances of the place), -- are altogether useless
   and needless, the words utterly refusing any accommodation to the
   business of our present debate. So that, --

   7. This dependence of the words, scope of the context, design of the
   place, and intendment of God in it, [and] the accommodation of the
   whole discourse to the removal of the objection and disproving of the
   proverbial self-justification of a sinful people, -- the only
   directories in the investigation of the true, proper, native, genuine
   sense and meaning of them, -- [having been neither] eyed, weighed, nor
   considered by Mr Goodwin, who knew how much it was to his advantage to
   rend away these two verses from the body of the prophet's discourse, I
   might well supersede any farther proceedings in the examination of what
   he has prepared for a reply to the answers commonly given to the
   argument taken from this place; yet, that all security imaginable may
   be given to the reader of the inoffensiveness of this place as to the
   truth we maintain, I shall briefly manifest that Mr Goodwin hath not
   indeed effectually taken up and off any one answer, or any one parcel
   of any such, that hath usually been given by our divines unto the
   objection against the doctrine of perseverance hence levied.

   That which naturally first offers itself to our consideration is, the
   form and tenor of the expressions here used, which is not of an
   absolute nature, but hypothetical The import of the words is, "If a
   righteous man turn from his righteousness, and continue [not] therein,
   he shall die." "True," say they who make use of this consideration,
   "God here proposes the desert of sin, and the connection that is, by
   his appointment, between apostasy and the punishment thereunto
   allotted; but this not at all infers that any one who is truly
   righteous shall or may everlastingly so apostatize. Such comminations
   as these God maketh use of to caution believers of the evil of
   apostasy, and thereby to preserve them from it; as their tendency to
   that end, by the appointment of God, and their efficacy thereunto, hath
   been declared. So that, because God says, If a righteous man turn from
   his righteousness, he shall die,' the whole emphasis lying in the
   connection that is between such turning away and dying, to conclude
   (considering what is the proper use and intendment of such
   threatenings) that a man truly righteous may so fall away, is to build
   up that which the text contributes not any thing to in the least."

   Against this plea Mr Goodwin riseth up with much contempt and
   indignation, chap. xii. sect. 9, in these words:--

   "But this sanctuary hath also been profaned by some of the chief
   guardians themselves of that cause for the protection and safety
   whereof it was built. There needs no more be done (though much more
   might be done, yea, and hath been done by others) than that learned
   doctor so lately named hath done himself for the demolishing of it.
   Having propounded the argument from the place in Ezekiel according to
   the import of the interpretation asserted by us, Some,' saith he,
   answer, that a condition proves nothing in being; which how true soever
   it may be in respect of such hypotheticals which are made use of only
   for the amplification of matters, and serve for the aggravating either
   of the difficulty or indignity of a thing (as, If I should climb up
   into heaven, thou art there,' Ps. cxxxix.; it were ridiculous to infer,
   therefore a man may climb up into heaven), yet such conditional sayings
   upon which admonitions, promises, or threatenings are built, do at
   least suppose something in possibility, however, by virtue of their
   tenor and form, they suppose nothing in being: for no man seriously
   intending to encourage a student in his way would speak thus to him, If
   thou wilt get all the books in the university library by heart, thou
   shalt be doctor this commencements.' Besides, in the case in hand, he
   that had a mind to deride the prophet might readily come upon him thus:
   But a righteous man, according to the judgment of those that are
   orthodox, cannot turn away from his righteousness; therefore your
   threatening is in vain.' Thus we see to how little purpose it is to
   seek for starting poles in such logic quirks as these.' Thus far the
   great assertor of the synod of Dort and the cause which they
   maintained, to show the vanity of such a sense or construction put upon
   the words now in debate which shall render them merely conditional, and
   will not allow them to import so much as a possibility of any thing
   contained or expressed in them."

   Ans. 1. Doctor Prideaux's choosing not to lay the weight of this answer
   to the argument of the Arminians from this place on the hypothetical
   manner of the expression used therein, is called a "defiling the
   sanctuary by the guardians of the cause whose protection it
   undertakes."


   "Crimina rasis

   Librat in antithetis; doctas posuisse figuras

   Laudatur?"

   Pers., Sat. i. 85-87.

   What are my thoughts of it I need not express, being unconcerned in the
   business, as knowing it not at all needful to be insisted on for the
   purpose for which it is produced, the text looking not at all towards
   the doctrines under consideration; yet I must needs say, I am not
   satisfied with the doctor's attempt for the removal of it, nor with
   what is farther added by the Remonstrants in the place which we are
   sent unto by Mr Goodwin's marginal directions. Though it should be
   granted that such conditional expressions do suppose, or may (for that
   they always do is not affirmed, and in some cases it is evident they do
   not), that there is something in posse, as the doctor speaks, whereunto
   they do relate, yet they do not infer that the possibility may by no
   means be hindered from ever being reduced into act. We grant a
   possibility of desertion in believers, in respect of their own
   principles of operation, -- which is ground sufficient for to give
   occasion to such hypothetical expressions as contain comminations and
   threatenings in them, -- but yet, notwithstanding that possibility on
   that account supposed, [on the point whether] the bringing forth of
   that possibility into an actual accomplishment may not be effectually
   prevented by the Spirit and grace of God, the doctor says nothing.
   This, I say, is ground sufficient for such hypothetical comminations,
   that in respect of them to whom they are made, it is possible to incur
   the thing threatened by the means therein mentioned, which yet upon
   other accounts is not possible; that God who says, "If the righteous
   man turn from his righteousness, he shall die," and says so on purpose
   to preserve righteous men from so doing, knowing full well that the
   thing, in respect of themselves of whom and to whom he speaks, is
   sufficiently possible to give a clear foundation to that expression. So
   that if Mr Goodwin hath not something of his own to add, he will find
   little relief from the conceptions of that learned doctor; wherein yet
   I should not have translated some phrases and expressions, as Mr
   Goodwin hath made bold to do.

   He adds, therefore, p. 276, "To say that God putteth a case in such
   solemnity and emphaticalness of words and phrase as are remarkable all
   along in the carriage of the place in hand, of which there is no
   possibility that it should ever happen or be exemplified in reality of
   event, and this in vindication of himself and the equity of his
   dealings and proceedings with men, is to bring a scandal and reproach
   of weakness upon that infinite wisdom of his which magnifies itself in
   all his works; which also is so much the more unworthy and unpardonable
   when there is a sense commodious, every way worthy as well the infinite
   wisdom as the goodness of God, pertinent and proper to the occasion he
   hath in hand, which offers itself plainly and clearly." So far he.

   And this is all, it seems, which Mr Goodwin hath to add. And, indeed,
   this all is nothing at all, but only the repetition of what was urged
   before by the doctor, in more swelling and less significant terms. What
   possibility there is in the thing hath been before manifested. That
   this possibility should necessarily be exemplified in reality of event,
   to give significancy to this expression, I suppose is not Mr Goodwin's
   own intendment. True believers, according to the doctrine he asserts
   (as he pretends), are only in such a remote possibility of apostasy as
   that it can scarce be called danger. Now, doubtless, it is possible
   that such a remote possibility may never be reduced into act. But now
   if Mr Goodwin will not be contented with such a possibility as may, but
   also will have that [which] must be exemplified in reality of event, he
   has advanced from a possibility in all to a necessity in some to
   apostatize.

   2. Had Mr Goodwin a little more attended to what here drops from him,
   -- namely, "That the words are used for the vindication of the justice
   of the proceedings of God," namely, in the particular case formerly
   opened and cleared, -- perhaps he would himself have judged the edge of
   this weapon to be so far blunted as to render it wholly useless to him
   in the combat wherein he is engaged. I hope, at least, that by the
   light of this spark he may apprehend the emphaticalness of all the
   expressions used in this place to be pointed towards the particular
   case under consideration, and not in the least to be expressive of the
   possibility he contends for. God knows what beseems his own infinite
   wisdom, and hath given us rules to judge thereof, as far as we are
   called thereto, in his word; and from thence, whether Mr Goodwin will
   pardon us or no in our so doing, we doubt not to evince that it
   exceedingly becomes the infinitely wise God emphatically to express
   that connection that is between one thing and another (sin and
   punishment, believing and salvation), by his appointment, though some
   never believe unto salvation, nor some sin to the actual inflicting of
   punishment on them. And as for Mr Goodwin's "commodious sense" of this
   place, we see not any advantage in it for any but those who are engaged
   into an opposition to the covenant of the grace of God and his
   faithfulness therein. So that once more, upon the whole matter, this
   text is discharged from farther attendance in the trial of the truth in
   hand.

   The severals of the text come nextly under consideration, and amongst
   them, first, the subject spoken of (that we may take the words in some
   order, Mr Goodwin having roved up and down, backwards and forwards,
   from one end of the text to the other, without any at all), and this
   is, "A righteous man;" that is, such an one as is described, verses
   5-9, "But if a man," etc.; that is, such an one as walks up to the
   judgments, and statutes, and ordinances of God, so far as they were of
   him required in the covenant of the land of Canaan, and according to
   the tenor of it, whereby they held their possession therein, and
   whereby heavenly things were also shadowed out. That this is the person
   intended, this his righteousness, and this the matter upon which he is
   here tried, is clear in the contexts beyond all possible contradiction;
   so that all farther inquiries into what righteousness is intended is
   altogether needless. What with any colour of probability can be
   pretended from hence as to the matter in hand arises from the analogy
   of God's dealings with men in the tenor of the covenant of grace and
   the covenant of the land of Israel; which yet are eminently
   distinguished in the very foundation of them, the one being built upon
   this bottom, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die," the other upon a
   dispensation of another import, as has been declared. We do, then,
   plainly supererogate as to the cause in hand, by the confutation of the
   answers which Mr Goodwin farther attempts to remove, and his endeavour
   therein; which yet shall not be declined.

   Sect. 8. One exposition, by some insisted on, of this term "A righteous
   man," is thus proposed by Mr Goodwin: "Notwithstanding, some formerly,
   it seems, in favour of the doctrine, attempted an escape from that
   sword of Ezekiel lately drawn against it, by pretending that by the
   righteous man' mentioned in the passage in hand is not meant a person
   truly and really righteous, but a kind of formal hypocrite, or outside
   professor of righteousness."

   Those who insist on this interpretation of the place tell you that in
   the commands of God there is the mere end of them considerable, and not
   the manner of their performance, which is as the life and power of the
   obedience of them, which is acceptable to God; farther, that many
   persons, wrought upon by the power of conviction from the law of God,
   and enabled in some measure with common gifts and graces, do go forth
   in such a way to the performance of the commands of God, as to the
   substance and matter of them (wherein also they are not hypocritical,
   in the strict sense of the word, but sincere), and so are called and
   counted righteous, comparatively so, in respect of those who live in
   open rebellion against the Lord and his ways. And such as these, they
   say, as they are oftentimes useful in their generations, and bring
   glory to God by their profession, so (especially under the old legal
   dispensation of the covenant) they are rewarded in a plentiful manner
   of God in this life, in the enjoyment of the abundance of all things in
   peace and quietness. Of this sort of men, -- that is, men upright and
   righteous in their dealings with men and in the world, conscientious in
   their trust, yielding professed subjection to the judgments and
   institutions of God, performing outwardly all known duties of religious
   men, -- they say, that after they have made a profession of some good
   continuance, having never attained union with God in Christ, nor being
   built on the rock, many do fall into all manner of spiritual and
   sensual abominations, exposing themselves to all the judgments and
   vengeance of God in this life, which also under the old testament
   generally overtook them, God being (as here he pleads) righteous
   herein. In this description of the righteous person here intended,
   there is no occasion in the least administered to Mr Goodwin to relieve
   himself against it by that which, in the close of this section, he
   borrows from Dr Prideaux, -- namely, "That if the righteous man should
   turn himself away from his counterfeit and hypocritical righteousness,
   he should rather live than die;" for they say not that this
   righteousness is hypocritical or counterfeit, but true and sincere in
   its kind, only the person himself is supposed not to be partaker of the
   righteousness of God in Christ and of a principle of life from him,
   which should alter his obedience, and render it spiritual and
   acceptable to God in the Son of his love.

   What more says Mr Goodwin unto this exposition of the words? With many
   scornful expressions cast both upon it (as by himself stated and laid
   down) and the synod of Dort, he tells you it was rejected by the synod.
   That some in the synod, looking on it perhaps under such a sense and
   apprehension as Mr Goodwin proposeth it in, did not see cause to close
   with it, may be true; yet that it was rejected by the synod Mr Goodwin
   can by no means prove, whatever he is pleased to say, and to insult
   thereon upon the judgments of very learned men, whom he hath no reason
   upon any account in the world to despise, the labours of very many of
   them praising them in the gates of Zion, exceedingly above the cry and
   clamour of all reproaches whatever mustered to their dishonour. But to
   let pass those poor, contemptible wretches, let us see how this master
   in our Israel in his indignation deals with this silly shift, whereby
   poor men strive to avoid his fury. Says he, then, --

   "And indeed the whole series and carriage of the context, from verse 20
   to the end of the chapter, demonstratively evinceth that by the
   righteous man' all along in meant such a man as was or is truly
   righteous, and who, had he persevered in that way of righteousness
   wherein he some time walked, should have worn the crown of
   righteousness, and received the reward of a righteous man; as by the
   wicked man,' all along opposed to him, is meant not a person seemingly
   wicked, but truly and really so, as is acknowledged on all hands. So
   that the antithesis or opposition between the righteous and the wicked,
   running so visibly quite through the body of the discourse, must needs
   be dissolved, if by the righteous man' should be meant a person
   seemingly righteous only, he that is righteous in this sense being
   truly and really wicked."

   Ans. The main series and context of the chapter, without the least
   endeavour to give any light or illustration thereunto by the scope,
   occasion, or dependence of the parts of it one upon another, does more
   than once stand Mr Goodwin in stead, when nothing else presents itself
   to his relief. It is true, the whole context of the chapter grants the
   person spoken of to be righteous in the performance of the duties
   mentioned in the chapter, in opposition to the wicked man and his
   intentions and ways described therein, in proportion to the
   dispensation of the covenant, whose rule and principle is placed in the
   head of verse 20, which Mr Goodwin directs us unto, namely, "The soul
   that sinneth, it shall die." And as there is nothing in all this
   contrary to any thing in this exposition by Mr Goodwin opposed, so
   there is not any thing more proved, nor once attempted to be, here by
   Mr Goodwin himself, than what is confessed therein.

   It is acknowledged that the person spoken of is truly and really
   righteous, with that kind of righteousness which is intended, and
   wherein if he continued he was to receive the reward of righteousness
   then under consideration; and yet though such an one might be truly and
   really united unto Christ, there is nothing in the text or context
   enforcing that such an one and none else is intended here. And more in
   this case Mr Goodwin hath not to add; nor doth he threaten us with any
   more than he hath delivered, as he did upon the consideration of the
   tenor of the words, and our inquiry whether they are of an hypothetical
   or absolute nature and importance.

   It is true, he adds that "Calvin, in his exposition on the place,
   notwithstanding his wariness to manage it so as that the doctrine of
   perseverance, which he maintained, might suffer no damage" (which
   perhaps Mr Goodwin was not so wary in expressing, contending so much as
   he does to manifest that he had thoughts lying another way), "and
   therefore asserting the person here spoken of to be a person seemingly
   righteous only, yet lets fall such things as declare nothing to be
   wanting in this righteous person but perseverance." But that Calvin
   grants, in any expression of his, this person, or him concerned herein,
   to be in such an estate as to want nothing but perseverance to render
   him everlastingly blessed, is notoriously false; neither does any thing
   in the expressions cited by Mr Goodwin come from the body of his
   discourse, [or] in the least look that way, as might easily be
   manifested, did I judge it meet, in a contest of this nature, to trade
   in the authorities of men: so that I cannot but wonder with what
   confidence he is pleased to impose such a sense upon his words. All
   this while, then, notwithstanding any thing our author hath to say to
   the contrary, the righteous person here intended may be only such an
   one as was described in the entrance of this consideration of his; and
   that it is not requisite, from the text or context, that he should be
   any other is more evident than that it is to be contended against.

   Sect. 7, he deals with another exposition of the words, which hath no
   small countenance given unto it from the Scriptures; which, for to
   prevail himself upon an expression or two by-the-by, he sets down in
   the words of Dr Prideaux, Lect. vi.; and they are these: "There is,"
   saith he, "a double righteousness; -- one inherent, or of works, by
   which we are sanctified; another imputed, or of faith, whereby we are
   justified. A righteous man may turn aside from his own righteousness,
   namely, from his holiness, and fall into very heinous sins; but it doth
   not follow from hence that therefore he hath wholly shaken off from him
   (or out of him) the righteousness of Christ." To this he advances a
   threefold reply:--

   1. "The doctor here presents us with a piece of new divinity, in making
   sanctification and justification no more intimate friends than that one
   can live without the company and presence of the other. Doubtless, if a
   man's justification may stay behind when his holiness is departed, that
   assertion of the apostle will hardly stand, Without holiness no man
   shall see the Lord,' Heb. xii. 14; and if They that are Christ's' (that
   is, who believe in Christ, and thereby are justified) have crucified
   the flesh with the affections and lusts' (another assertion of the same
   apostle), how their relation unto Christ should stand, and yet their
   holiness sink and fall, I understand not. But I leave his friends to be
   his enemies in this."

   Ans. How little advantage Mr Goodwin hath obtained by attempting a
   diversion from the consideration of the matter insisted on (which is
   all he doth in this paragraph) will quickly appear. From the
   righteousness of sanctification there is, or may be supposed, a twofold
   fall; -- first, From the exercises of it, in all or any of the fruits
   thereof, according to the will of God; secondly, From the habit and
   principle of it, in respect of its root and ground-work in the soul. It
   is the former that the doctor asserts. "A man," saith he, "may fall
   away from the zealous practice of the duties of holiness, and, with or
   under violence of temptation, as to fruit-bearing, decay in close
   walking, until the whole seem ready to die, so as, through the
   righteous judgment of God, to be exposed to calamities, corrections,
   and punishments in this life, yea, the great death itself, as it fell
   out in the case of Josiah, who fell by the sword in undertaking against
   the mind and will of God." But now for the work and principles of
   holiness, none who have once received it can ever cast it up and become
   wholly without it; and between this and the righteousness of
   justification, there is that strict connection that the one cannot,
   doth not, consist without the other. If now Mr Goodwin understands not
   how a justified, sanctified person, may decline from the ways and
   practice of holiness for a season, so as to provoke the Lord to deal
   sharply, yea, and sometimes terribly with him, to take vengeance on his
   inventions, and yet that person not lose his relation to Christ nor his
   interest in the love and favour of God, I shall not presume to instruct
   him in the knowledge thereof, but refer him to them who are better able
   so to do; wherein, upon the account of his aptness to hear as well as
   teach, I presume their undertaking will not be difficult. He adds, --

   2. "He seems, by his word penitus, wholly, throughly, or altogether, to
   be singular also in another strain of divinity, and to teach magis and
   minus in justification: for in saying that from a man's apostatizing
   from his own righteousness, it doth not follow that therefore he hath
   wholly or altogether shaken off the imputed righteousness of Christ,'
   doth he not imply that a man may shake off some part of the
   righteousness of Christ from him, and yet keep another part of it upon
   him? or else, that by sinning he may come to wear the entire garment or
   clothing of it so loosely that it will be ready to drop or fall off
   from him every, hour? and, consequently, that the righteousness of
   Christ sits faster and closer upon some than upon others, yea, upon the
   same person at one time than another."

   Ans. That this is a second attempt for to lead the reader off from the
   consideration of the business in hand, and to prepare him by a
   diversion to an acceptation of what he afterward tenders in way of
   reply, that he may not perceive how insufficient it is for the purpose
   by an immediate comparing of it with the answer itself, is evident.
   Truly, when, in my younger days, I was wont to hear that doctor in his
   lectures and other exercises, I did not think then I should have
   afterward found him called in question for want of skill to express
   himself and the sense of his mind in Latin, he having a readiness and
   dexterity in that language equal to any that ever I knew; neither yet
   am I convinced that his word penitus, upon which Mr Goodwin criticiseth
   (being commonly, as might by innumerable instances be made good, used
   to increase and make emphatical the import of the word wherewith it is
   associated), will evince any such meaning in his expression as is there
   intended by Mr Goodwin. Justification is, and it was so taught by the
   doctor to be (Lect. de Just.), in respect of all persons that are
   partakers of it, equal, and equal to every person so partaking of it at
   all times, though in regard of sense and perception, and the peace and
   comfort wherewith (when perceived and felt) it is attended, it is no
   less subject to increases and wanings than sanctification itself. So
   that this also might be intended by the doctor, without the least
   "strain of new divinity," that justified and sanctified persons, though
   they might so decline from the course of close walking with God as for
   a season to be like a tree in winter, whose substance is in his roots,
   his leaves and fruit falling off, ceasing to bring forth the fruits of
   holiness in such degrees as formerly, and so lose their sense of
   acceptation with God through Christ, and the peace, with consolation
   and joy, wherewith it is attended, yet they could not, nor should,
   wholly be cast out of the favour of God, the nature and essence of
   their justification being abiding; and what singular strain of divinity
   there is in the tendency of such a discourse I know not. Besides, that
   teaching of magis and minus in justification should be any singular
   thing in Mr Goodwin I do not well understand; for if the matter of our
   righteousness, or that upon the imputation whereof unto us we are
   justified, may have its degrees, and receive magis and minus, as
   certainly our faith may and doth, why our justification may not do so
   too I see no reason. But he comes at length to the matter, and addeth,
   --

   3. "Lastly; were it granted unto the doctor that from a man's turning
   aside from his own holiness, it doth not follow that therefore he hath
   wholly divested himself of the righteousness of Christ imputed, yet
   from God's determination or pronouncing a man to be in an estate of
   condemnation and of death it follows roundly, that therefore he is
   divested of the righteousness of Christ imputed (if ever he were
   invested with it before); because no man with that righteousness upon
   him can be in such an estate. Now we have, upon several grounds, proved
   that the righteous man,' under that apostasy wherein Ezekiel describes
   and presents him, is pronounced by God a child not of a temporal but
   eternal death and condemnation. This, indeed, the doctor denies, but
   gives no reason of his denial, for which I blame him not; only, I must
   crave leave to say, that the chair [211] weigheth not so much as one
   good argument with me, much less as many. So that, all this while, He
   that spake and still speaks unto the world by Ezekiel is no friend to
   that doctrine which denieth a possibility of a righteous man's
   declining even unto death."

   Ans. If this be all that Mr Goodwin hath to say for the removal of this
   answer, that cuts the throat of his argument if it be not removed, he
   hath little reason for the confidence wherewith he closeth it,
   concerning God's speaking in this place of Ezekiel against that
   doctrine which, in innumerable places of his word, he hath taught us is
   a doctrine inwrapping no small portion of that grace which, in a
   covenant of mercy, he dispenseth to his chosen, redeemed, justified,
   sanctified ones; neither is there any need to add the weight of the
   chair (wherein yet that person spoken of behaved himself worthily in
   his generation, and was in his exercises therein by no means by Mr
   Goodwin to be despised) [to] be laid upon the reasonings of the doctor
   in this case, they proving singly of themselves too heavy for Mr
   Goodwin to bear. In brief, that the substance of the reply in hand is
   merely a begging of the thing in question, any one that hath but half
   an eye in a business of this nature may easily discern. That it is
   supposed that a man truly righteous and justified in the blood of
   Christ may so fall away as to be pronounced of God to be in a state of
   damnation, and so fallen really from his former condition, [212] is the
   thing that Mr Goodwin hath to prove. "Now," saith he, "this must needs
   be so, because God here, upon such a supposal, pronounceth such a man
   to be in the estate of condemnation." What this is with other men I
   know not, but to me it is no proof at all, nor should I believe that to
   be the sense of the place, though, in variety of expressions, he should
   significantly affirm it a thousand times. The reader also is
   misinformed that the doctor attempts not any proof that by death,
   eternal death is not in this place intended; he that shall consult the
   place will find himself abused. But we must speak more of this anon.

   And this is all our author offers as to the person spoken of in the
   place of Scripture under consideration; wherein, though he hath taken
   some pains, to little or no purpose, to take off the exposition of the
   words and the description of the person given by others, yet he hath
   not attempted to give so much as one argument to confirm the sense he
   would impose on us concerning the condition of the person spoken of;
   and I must crave leave to say, that naked assertions, be they never so
   many, in the chair or out, weigh not so much with me as one good
   argument, much less as many.

   There is nothing remains for consideration hut only the comminatory
   part of the words, or the expression of the punishment allotted of God
   to such as walk in the ways of apostasy here expressed, "In his
   trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned,
   in them shall he die;" that is, "He shall be dealt withal as many of
   his nation were in the land of Israel My judgments shall overtake him.
   It shall not advantage him that either he had godly parents that have
   walked with me, or that he himself had so behaved himself in a way of
   righteousness, as before described. If he turn to the profaneness and
   abominations which are laid down as the ways of wicked men, or into any
   paths like them, he shall even die, or be punished for his sins;"
   according to the tenor of the truth laid down in the entrance of the
   chapter, and repeated again verse 20, "The soul that sinneth, it shall
   die." But now, whereas it might be replied, "Such an one,
   notwithstanding his degeneracy, might yet perhaps recover himself to
   his former way of walking, obedience, and righteousness in
   conversation, and is there then no hope nor help for him, but having
   once so apostatized he must suffer for it?" to prevent any such
   misprision of the mind of God, there is added the term of his duration
   in that state of apostasy; that is, even unto death: "If he committeth
   iniquity, and dieth in it," that is, repents not of it before his
   death, "the judgments of God shall find him out," as was before
   expressed; "If by his repentance he prevent not his calamities, he
   shall end his sinning in destruction;" -- in which expressions of the
   person's continuance in his apostatized condition, and of the judgments
   of God falling on him on that account, there is not the least
   appearance of any tautology or incongruity in the sense. The same word
   is used to express diverse concernments of it, which is no tautology.
   Though the same word be used, yet the same thing is not intended.
   Tautology reflects on things, not words; otherwise there must be a
   tautology wherever there is an antanaklasis, as John i. 3. "To commit
   iniquity, and to die therein," is no more but to continue in his
   iniquity impenitently until death. Now, to say that [this], "A man was
   put to death for his fault, because he committed it, and continued
   impenitent in it, even unto the death which he was adjudged to, and
   which was inflicted on him for his fault," is an incoherent expression,
   it seems will puzzle as great a master of language as Mr Goodwin to
   make good.

   Mr Goodwin endeavours to make the punishment threatened in the words,
   "He shall die for his iniquity," precisely and exclusively to signify
   eternal death (which the former interpretation doth not exclude); which
   he is no way able to make good. What he offers, sect. 3, concerning the
   incongruity of the sense, and tautology of the expression of it, [if
   it] be not so understood, hath been already removed. The comparison
   ensuing, instituted between these words and those of 1 Cor. vi. 10,
   should have been enforced with some consideration of the coincidence of
   the scope of either place, with the expressions used in them. And
   though repentance (which is also added) will not deliver them from
   temporal or natural death, yet it may and will, as [it] did Ahab in
   part, from having that death inflicted in the way of an extraordinary
   judgment.

   Sect. 4. Mr Goodwin offers sundry things, all of the same importance
   and tendency, all animated by the same fallacies or mistakes, to make
   good the sense he insists on, exclusively to all others, of these
   words, "He shall die;" and he tells you that "if the righteousness such
   a man hath done shall come into no account, if it shall not profit him
   as to his temporal deliverance, then it is impossible it should profit
   him as to his eternal salvation." But, first, according to our
   interpretation of the words, there is no necessity incumbent on us to
   affirm that the person mentioned shall obtain salvation, though we say
   that eternal death is not precisely threatened in the words. But yet,
   that a man may not by the just hand of God, be punished with temporal
   death for his faults and iniquities (as Josiah fell by the sword), and
   yet have his righteousness reckoned to him as to his great recompense
   of reward, is a strain of doctrine that Mr Goodwin will scarce abide
   by. I dare not say that all who died in the wilderness of the children
   of Israel went to hell and came short of eternal life, and yet they all
   fell there because of their iniquities. But he adds, --

   Sect. 4. "Again; that which God here threateneth against that double or
   twofold iniquity of backsliding is opposed to that life which is
   promised to repentance and perseverance in well-doing; but this life is
   confessed by all to be eternal life: therefore the death opposed to it
   must needs be eternal, or the second death. When the apostle saith, The
   wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through
   Jesus Christ our Lord," Rom. vi. 23, is it not evident from the
   antithesis, or opposition in the sentence between the death and life
   mentioned in it, that by that death which he affirms to be the wages of
   sin is meant eternal death? how else will the opposition stand?"

   Ans. It is true, the life and death here mentioned, the one promised,
   verse 9, the other threatened in those insisted on, are opposed, and of
   what nature and kind the one is, of the same is the other to be
   esteemed. It is also confessed that the life promised in the covenant
   of mercy to repentance is eternal life, and the wages of sin mentioned
   in the law is eternal death; but that therefore that must be the sense
   of the words when they are made use of in answer to an objection
   expressed in a proverb concerning the land of Israel, and when it was
   temporal death that was complained of before in the proverb, "The
   fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on
   edge" (they did not complain that they were damned for their fathers'
   sins), that Mr Goodwin doth not attempt to prove; and I do not blame
   him for his silence therein. He says yet again, --

   "When God in the Scriptures threatens impenitent persons with death for
   their sins, doubtless he intends and means eternal death, or that death
   which is the wages of sin; otherwise we have no sufficient ground to
   believe or think that men dying in their sins without repentance shall
   suffer the vengeance of eternal fire,' but only a temporal or natural
   death, which those who are righteous and truly eminent themselves
   suffer as well as they. Therefore, to say that God threatens impenitent
   apostates (in the place in hand) with a temporal death only, when, as
   elsewhere, he threatens impenitency under the lightest guilt of all
   with eternal death, is in effect to represent him as vehement and sore
   in his dissuasives from ordinary and lesser sins, and as indifferent
   and remiss in dissuading from sins of the greatest provocation."

   Ans. The sum of this reason is, "If the death there threatened to those
   men of our present contest be not death eternal, we have no sufficient
   ground to believe that God will inflict any death on impenitent
   apostates but only that which is temporal or natural, which others die
   as well as they." And why so, I beseech you? Is there no other place of
   Scripture whence it may be evinced that eternal death is the wages of
   sin? or is every place thereof where death is threatened to sin so
   circumstantiated as this place is? is the threatening everywhere given
   out upon the like occasion, and to be accommodated to the like state of
   things? These discourses are exceedingly loose, sophistical, and
   inconclusive. Neither is a violent death counted natural, though it be
   the dissolution of nature.

   Neither is there any thing more added by Mr Goodwin, in all his
   considerations of the words of this passage of the Scriptures, than
   what we have insisted on. That [argument] he nextly mentioneth, "That
   if God here threateneth impenitent sinners only with temporal death,
   then why should the most profligate sinners fear any other punishment?"
   is of [no?] more energy for the confirmation and building up of the
   sense which he imposeth on the words than that which went before. They
   with whom he hath to do will tell him that he doth all along most
   vainly assume and beg the thing in question, namely, that the persons
   intimated are absolutely impenitent sinners, and not so under some
   considerations only, -- that is, that do never recover themselves from
   their degeneracy from close walking with God, -- nor do the words
   indeed necessarily import any thing else. And for impenitent sinners in
   general (not those who are only so termed), there are testimonies
   sufficient in the Scriptures concerning God's righteous judgment in
   their eternal condemnation.

   And this is the first testimony produced by Mr Goodwin for the proof of
   the saints' apostasy, -- a witness which of all others he doth most
   rely upon, and which he bringeth in with the greatest acclamation of
   success (before the trial) imaginable. But when he hath brought him
   forth, he gives us no account in the least whence he comes, what is his
   business, or what he aims to confirm, nor can make good his speaking
   one word on his behalf! Indeed, as the matter is handled, I something
   question whether lightly a weaker argument hath been leaned on, in a
   case of so great importance, than that which from these words is drawn
   for the apostasy of the saints; for as we have not the least attempt
   made to give us an account of the context, scope, and intendment of the
   place (by which yet the expressions in the verses insisted on must be
   regulated), so no more can any one expression in it be made good to be
   of that sense and signification which yet alone will or can yield the
   least advantage to the cause for whose protection it is so earnestly
   called upon. Now, the leaders and captains of the forces Mr Goodwin
   hath mustered in this 12th chapter being thus discharged, the residue,
   or the followers thereof, will easily be prevailed with to return every
   one to his own place in peace.

   The next place of Scripture produced to consideration, Mr Goodwin
   ushers in (sect. 11) with a description of the adversaries with whom in
   this contest he hath to do; and sets them off to public view with the
   desirable qualifications of "ignorance, ""prejudice," and "partiality,"
   having, it seems, neither ingenuity enough candidly and fairly
   themselves to search into and to weigh the scriptures wherein the case
   in question is clearly determined, nor skill enough to understand and
   receive them when so dexterously opened to their hand by Mr Goodwin.
   What they are the Lord knoweth, will judge, determine, and in the
   appointed time declare; and it may be the day that shall manifest all
   things will vindicate them from these reproaches. In the meantime, such
   expressions as these lie in the middle between all parties at variance,
   exposed to the use of any one that is pleased to take them up. The
   place insisted on in the sequel of this preface is the parable of our
   Saviour, Matt. xviii. 32-35; the whole extent of the parable is from
   verse 21 to the end of the chapter. Hence Mr Goodwin thus inferreth,
   sect. 11:--

   "Evident it is, from our Saviour's reddition or application of the
   parable, So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if,'
   etc., speaking unto his disciples, verse 1, and to Peter more
   particularly, verse 21, that persons truly regenerate and justified
   before God (for such were they to whom in special manner he addressed
   the parable and the application of it, and indeed the whole carriage of
   the parable showeth that it was calculated and formed only for such)
   may, through high misdemeanours in sinning (as, for example, by
   unmercifulness, cruelty, oppression, etc.), turn themselves out of the
   justifying grace and favour of God, quench the Spirit of regeneration,
   and come to have their portion with hypocrites and unbelievers."

   Ans. 1. This is not the only occasion whereupon we have to deal with
   this parable. The Socinians wrest it also with violence to disprove the
   satisfaction of Christ, from the mention that is made in it of the free
   forgiveness of sins, and the Lord's enjoining others to do what he did;
   -- they, doubtless, being [ready] to forgive without satisfaction given
   or made as to any crimes committed against them! Mr Goodwin, with much
   less probability of drawing nigh to the intendment of our Saviour in
   this place, makes use of it, or rather abuses it, to countenance his
   doctrine of the apostasy of the saints. To both I say, parables have
   their bounds and limits, their lines and proportions, scope and
   peculiar intendment, beyond which they prove nothing at all. To wring
   the nose of a parable or similitude, to force it to an universal
   compliance, will bring forth blood. There is nothing so sottish, or
   foolish, or contradictious in and to itself, as may not be countenanced
   from teaching parables to be instructive and proving in every parcel or
   expression that attends them. The intendment of the parable here used,
   that whereas, from the proportion and answerableness of the comparates,
   it argueth, is neither that God forgives without satisfaction to his
   justice, being the judge of all the world, nor that believers may fall
   away by sins of unmercifulness and oppression, and so perish
   everlastingly; but that men, upon the account of mercy and forgiveness
   received from God in Christ, ought to extend mercy and kindness to
   their brethren, God threatening and revenging unmercifulness and
   oppression in and on whomsoever it is found. Whether it be ignorance in
   us or what it be, the Lord knows and will judge; but we are not able to
   stretch the lines of this parable one step towards what Mr Goodwin
   would lengthen them unto. That no persons whatever must or ought to
   expect the grace and pardoning mercy of God to them, who have no bowels
   of compassion towards their brethren, is clearly taught. In making the
   rest of the circumstances of the parable argumentative, we cannot join
   with our adversary, he himself in his so doing working merely for his
   own ends.

   2. Finding his exposition of this parable liable and obnoxious to an
   exception, in that it renders God changeable in his dealings with men,
   and a knot to be cast on his doctrine which he is not able to untie, he
   ventures boldly to cut it in pieces, by affirming "that indeed God
   loves no man at all with any love but the approbation of the
   qualifications that are in him, and that he cannot be said to change in
   reference to that which is not in him at all." This he sets out and
   illustrates variously with the dealings of men, and the laws that are
   made amongst them, rewarding what is good and punishing what is evil,
   etc., -- words fully fitted, in his apprehension, to the clearing of
   God from any shadow of alteration in that course of proceeding which to
   him he ascribes, -- and tells you, "The root of the mistake concerning
   the love of God" towards any man's person lies in that "capital error
   of personal election," or a purpose of God to give grace and glory to
   any one in Christ. Kakou korakos kakion oon. That Mr Goodwin doth at
   all understand the love of God, if his apprehension of it be uniform to
   what he expresseth here in disputation, I must question. An eternal,
   unchangeable love of God to some in Christ is not now my task to
   demonstrate; it may, through the patience and goodness of God, find a
   place in my weak endeavours for the Lord ere long, when it will be a
   matter of delight to consider the scriptures and testimonies of
   antiquity that Mr Goodwin will produce for the eversion of such a
   personal election. For the present, I shall only take notice of the
   force of his judgment in the thing which, sect. 13, he here delivers:
   "All the love which God bears to men, or to any person of man, is
   either in respect of their nature and as they are men, in respect of
   which he bears a general or common love to them; or in respect of their
   qualifications as they are good men in one degree or other, in respect
   whereof he bears a more special love to them." What that "common love"
   is in Mr Goodwin's doctrine which God bears to "all men, as men," we
   know full well; he also himself is not unacquainted how often it hath
   been demonstrated to be a vain and foolish figment (in the sense by him
   and his associates obtruded on us), derogatory to all the glorious
   properties of the nature of God, and inconsistent with any thing that
   of himself he hath revealed; the demonstration and farther eviction
   whereof waits its season, which I hope draweth on. The "special love"
   which he bears persons "in respect of their qualifications" is only his
   approbation of those qualifications, wherever they are, and in
   whomsoever. That these qualifications are, faith, love, repentance,
   gospel obedience, etc., is not called into question. I would fain know
   of Mr Goodwin on what account and consideration some men, and not all,
   are translated from the condition of being objects of God's common love
   to become objects of his peculiar love, or from whence spring those
   qualifications which are the procurement of it, -- whether they are
   from any love of God to them in whom they are. If not, on what account
   do men come to have faith, love, obedience, etc.? If they are from any
   love of God, whether it be from the common love of God to man, as men?
   and if so, why are not all men endowed with these qualifications? If
   from his peculiar love, how come they to be the effects and causes of
   the same thing? Or whether, indeed, this assertion be not destructive
   to the whole covenant of grace, and the effectual dispensations of it
   in the blood of Christ? And to his second testimony I shall add no
   more.

   The third place insisted on is that of the apostle, 1 Cor. ix. 27.
   Hence he thus argueth:--

   "If Paul, after his conversion unto Christ, was in a possibility of
   being or becoming a reprobate' or castaway,' then may true believers
   fall away both totally and finally (for finally ever includes totally);
   but the antecedent is true, -- Paul after his conversion was in the
   possibility mentioned: ergo. The major proposition, I presume, will
   pass without control."

   Ans. That Mr Goodwin is not able to make good either of the
   propositions in this syllogism will evidently appear in the conclusion
   of our examination of what he draws forth, new and old, to that
   purpose. Of the major he gives you only this account, "It will pass, I
   presume, without control." But by his favour, unless cleared from
   ambiguity of expressions and fallacy, it is not like to obtain so fair
   a passage as is presumed and fancied.

   Though the term of "possibility" in the supposition, and "may" in the
   inference, seem to be equipollent, yet to render them of the same
   significancy as to the argument in hand, they must both be used in the
   same respect. But if a possibility of being a reprobate (that is, one
   rejected of God, by a metonymy of the effect) be ascribed to Paul in
   respect of himself and the infirmity of his own will as to abiding with
   God (in which case alone there is any appearance of truth in the
   assumption of this supposition), and the term of "may," in respect of
   believers falling totally and finally away, respects the event and
   purpose, decrees or promise of God concerning it (in which sense alone
   it is any step to the purpose in hand), I deny the inference, and
   thereby at the very entrance give check and control to Mr Goodwin's
   procedure. That which is possible to come to pass, that term "possible"
   affecting the end or coming to pass, must be every way and in all
   respects possible; this is the intendment of the inference. That which
   is possible in respect of some certain causes or principles (the terms
   of "possibility" affecting the thing itself whereof it is spoken in its
   next causes) may be impossible on another account; and in this sense
   only is there any colour of truth contained in the supposition. So that
   the major proposition of this syllogism is laid up and secured from
   doing any farther service in this case.

   The minor is, "But Paul after his conversion was in a possibility of
   becoming a reprobate or castaway."

   Ans. He was not in respect of the event, upon the account of the
   purpose and promises of God of him and to him, made in Christ, though
   any such possibility may be affirmed of him in respect of himself and
   his own will, not confirmed in grace unto an impossibility of swerving.
   Now, this proposition he thus farther attempts syllogistically to
   confirm:--

   "That which Paul was very solicitous and industrious to prevent, he was
   in a possibility of suffering or being made; but Paul was very
   solicitous and industrious to prevent his being made a castaway, as the
   scripture in hand plainly avoucheth, -- he kept under his body and
   brought it into subjection, in order to prevent his becoming a
   castaway: ergo, he was in danger or possibility of being made a
   castaway. The reason of the consequence in the major proposition is,
   because no man of understanding will be solicitous to prevent or hinder
   the coming to pass of such a thing, the coming to pass whereof he knows
   to be impossible."

   Ans. Once more the major is questioned. Paul might and ought to labour,
   in the use of means, for the preventing of that which, in respect of
   himself, he might possibly run into, God having appointed those means
   to be used for the prevention of the end feared and avoided, although
   in respect of some other preventing cause it was impossible he should
   so do. He who complained that "in him, that is, in his flesh, dwelt no
   good," that "he had a law in his members leading him captive to the law
   of sin, and sin working in him all manner of concupiscence," for whose
   prevention from running out into a course of sinning God had appointed
   means to be used, might use those means for that end, notwithstanding
   that God had immutably purposed and faithfully promised that in the use
   of those means he should attain the end aimed at. And the reason Mr
   Goodwin gives for the confirmation of the consequence is no other but
   that which we have so often exploded, -- namely, that a man need not,
   ought not to use means for attaining of any end, though appointed and
   instituted of God for that end and purpose, if so be the end for which
   they are ordained shall certainly and infallibly be compassed and
   accomplished by them. Our Saviour Christ thought meet to use the
   ordinary ways for the preservation of his life, notwithstanding the
   promise of keeping him by the angels; and Hezekiah neglected not the
   means of life, notwithstanding the infallible promise of living so long
   which he had received. Paul was careful, in the use of means, to
   prevent that which, in [respect of] himself, it was possible for him to
   run into, though he had, or might have had, assurance that, through the
   faithfulness and power of God, in the use of those means (as an
   antecedent of the consequent, though not the conditions of the event),
   he should be preserved certainly and infallibly from what he was in
   himself so apt unto. So that, whatever be the peculiar intendment of
   the apostle in this place, taking the term adokimos in the largest
   sense possible, and in a significancy of the greatest compass, yet
   nothing will regularly be inferred thence to the least prejudice of the
   doctrine I have undertaken to maintain.

   And this may suffice as to the utmost of what Mr Goodwin's argument
   from this place doth reach unto. There is another, and that a more
   proper sense of the place, and accommodated to the context and scope of
   the apostle, wherewith the doctrine endeavoured to be confirmed from
   hence hath not the least pretence of communion; and this ariseth (as
   was before manifested) from the scope of the place, with the proper,
   native signification of the word adokimos, here translated "a
   castaway."

   The business that the apostle hath in hand, from verse 15 of the
   chapter, and which he presses to the end, is a relation of his own
   principles, ways, and deportment, in the great work of the preaching of
   the gospel to him committed. In the last words of the chapter he
   acquaints us with one especial aim he had in the carrying on of that
   work, through the whole course of his employment therein; and it is,
   such care and endeavour after personal mortification, holiness, and
   self-denial, that he might no way be lifted up nor entangled with the
   revelations made to him; therein providing, in the midst of the great
   certainty and assurance which he had, verse 26, that he might approve
   himself "a workman not needing to be ashamed," as not only preaching to
   others for their good, but himself also accepted of God in the
   discharge of that employment, as one that had dealt uprightly and
   faithfully therein. Verse 27, he acquaints us with what is the state
   and condition of them that preach the gospel: their work may go on, and
   yet themselves not be approved in the work. This he laboured to
   prevent, walking uprightly, faithfully, sincerely, zealously, humbly,
   in the discharge of his duty: Mepos allois keruxas, saith he, autos
   adokimos gnomai; -- "Lest having preached to others, he should not
   himself be approved and accepted in that work," and so lose the reward
   mentioned, verse 17, peculiar to them who walk in the discharge of
   their duty with a right foot, according to the mind of God. The whole
   context, design, and scope of the apostle, with the native
   signification of the word adokimos, leading us evidently and directly
   to this interpretation, it is sufficiently clear that Mr Goodwin is
   like to find little shelter for his apostasy in this assertion of the
   apostle: and besides, whatever be the importance of the word, the
   apostle mentions not any thing but his conscientious, diligent use of
   the means for the attaining of an end, which end yet may fully be
   promised of God to be so brought about and accomplished.

   Mr Goodwin tells us, indeed, "That the word adokimos is in the writings
   of the apostle constantly translated "reprobate," as Rom. i. 28, 2 Cor.
   xiii. 5-7, 2 Tim. iii. 8, Titus i. 16, or is expressed by a word
   equivalent, as Heb. vi. 8." How rightly this is done, in his judgment,
   he tells us not; that it is so done serves his turn, and he hath no
   cause farther to trouble himself about it The truth is, in most of the
   places intimated, the word is so restrained, either from the causes of
   the thing expressed, as Rom. i. 28, or the conditions of the persons of
   whom it is affirmed, with some adjunct in the use of it, as 2 Tim. iii.
   8, Titus i. 16, that it necessarily imports a disallowance or rejection
   of God as to the whole state and condition wherein they are of whom it
   is asserted, joined with a profligate disposition to farther
   abominations in themselves; but that in any place it imports what Mr
   Goodwin would wrest it here unto, "a man finally rejected of God," --
   whatever may be the thought of others, he will not assert. And whatever
   the translation be, I would know of him whether, in any place where the
   word is used, he doth indeed understand it in any other sense than that
   which here he opposes: only with this difference, that in other places
   it regards the general condition and state of them concerning whom it
   is affirmed; here, only the condition of a man, restrained to the
   particular case of labouring in the ministry, which is under
   consideration. 2 Cor. xiii. 5-7, the word cannot be extended any
   farther than to signify a condition of men when they are not accepted
   nor approved; which is the sense of the word contended for: nor yet
   Heb. vi. 8, though it be attended with those several qualifications of
   nigh unto cursing, etc. The apostle, ascending by degrees in the
   description of the state of the unfruitful, barren land, says first it
   is adokimos, or disallowed by the husbandman, as that which he hath
   spent his cost and labour about in vain; so that not only the original,
   first signification of the word (as is known) stands for the sense
   contended for, but it is also evidently restrained to that sense by the
   context, design, and scope of the place, with the intendment of the
   apostle therein, the word being the same that [is used] in all other
   places of the writings of the same apostle, unless where it is measured
   as to its extent and compass by some adjoined expression, which is
   interpretive of it as to the particular place, being still of the same
   signification.

   Mr Goodwin's ensuing discourse is concerning the judgment of expositors
   upon the place, particularly naming Chrysostom, Calvin, Musculus,
   Diodati, the English annotators; of whom, notwithstanding, not any one
   doth appear for him, so unhappy is he in his quotations, though sundry
   of good note (and amongst them Piscator himself) do interpret the word
   in the sense by him contended for, knowing full well that it may be
   allowed in its utmost significancy without the least prejudice to the
   doctrine of the saints' perseverance, as hath been manifested. Of those
   mentioned by Mr Goodwin, there is not any one, from first to last, but
   restrained the word to the reproachableness or irreproachableness of
   the apostle in the discharge of the work of the ministry; the sense of
   it which we also insist upon. To spend time and labour in searching the
   expressions of particular men, weighing and considering the coherences,
   design, and circumstances of their writings, is beside my intention.
   The judgment of what hath been affirmed is left to the intelligent
   reader who supposeth it of his concernment to inquire particularly into
   it.

   What is added of the scope of the place, sect. 15, p. 280, alone
   requires any farther consideration. This, then, he thus proposeth:--

   "5. The scope of the place, from verse 23, evinceth the legitimacy of
   such a sense in both above all contradiction; for the apostle, having
   asserted this for the reason, motive, and end, why he had made himself
   a servant to all men, in bearing with all men's humours and weaknesses
   in the course of his ministry, namely, that he might be partaker of the
   gospel (that is, of the saving benefit or blessing of the gospel) with
   them, verse 23, and again, that what he did he did to obtain an
   incorruptible crown, verse 25, plainly showeth that that which he
   sought to prevent, by running and fighting at such a high rate as he
   did, was not the blame and disparagement of some such misbehaviour,
   under which, notwithstanding, he might retain the saving love of God,
   but the loss of his part and portion in the gospel, and of that
   incorruptible crown which he sought, by that severe hand which he still
   held over himself, to obtain."

   Ans. The scope of the place was before manifested, in answer to its
   dependence on the whole discourse foregoing, from verse 15, where the
   apostle enters upon the relation of his deportment in the work and
   service of the gospel, with a particular eye to his carriage therein as
   to his use or forbearance of the allowance of temporal things from them
   to whom he preached; which was due to him by all the right whereby any
   claim in any kind whatever may be pursued, together with the express
   institution of the Lord Jesus Christ, by him before laid down. In this
   course he behaved himself with wisdom, zeal, and diligence, having many
   glorious aims in his eye, as also being full of a sense of the duty
   incumbent on him, verse 16; to whose performance he was constrained by
   the law of Jesus Christ, as he also here expresses. Among other things
   that provoked him to and supported him in his hard labour and travail,
   was the love he bare to the gospel, and that he might have fellowship
   with others in the propagation and declaration of the glorious message
   thereof. This is his intendment, verse 23, touto de, etc. For the
   gospel's sake, or the love he bare to it, he desired with others to be
   partaker of it; -- that is, of the excellent work of preaching of it;
   for of the benefit of the gospel he might have been partaker with other
   believers, though he had never been set apart to its promulgation. In
   his whole discourse he still speaks accommodately to his business in
   hand, for the describing of his work of apostleship in preaching the
   glorious gospel of Jesus Christ; and as to the end of this work, he
   acquaints us that there was proposed before him the incorruptible crown
   of his Master's approbation (upon his lawful running and striving in
   the way of the ministry whereto he was called), -- the peculiar glory
   of them whom he is pleased to employ in his service. And though the
   cause of his fighting at that rate as he did was not wholly the fear of
   non-approbation in that work, a necessity of duty being incumbent on
   him which he was to discharge, yet he that knows how to value the crown
   of approbation from Christ, the holy angels, and the church, of having
   faithfully discharged the office of a steward in dispensing the things
   of God, will think it sufficiently effectual to stir up any one to the
   utmost expense of love, pains, and diligence, that he may not come
   short of it. And of Mr Goodwin's proof this is the issue.

   His next is from Heb. vi. 4-8, with x. 26-29, which he brings in
   attended with the ensuing discourse, sect. 18:--

   "The next passage we shall insist upon to evince the possibility of a
   final defection in the saints openeth itself in these words: For it is
   impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the
   heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have
   tasted of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if
   they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they
   crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open
   shame. For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
   it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed,
   receiveth blessing from God: but that which beareth thorns and briers
   is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.'
   Answerable hereunto is another in the same epistle: For if we sin
   wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
   remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for
   of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
   He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three
   witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
   thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
   counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an
   unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?' Evident
   it is that in these two passages the Hoy Ghost, after a serious manner,
   and with a very pathetic and moving strain of speech and discourse
   (scarce the like to be found in all the Scriptures), admonisheth those
   who are at present true believers to take heed of relapsing into the
   ways of their former ignorance and impiety. This caveat or admonition
   he presseth by an argument of this import, that in case they shall thus
   relapse, there will be very little or no hope at all of their recovery,
   or return to the estate of faith and grace wherein now they stand.
   Before the faces of such sayings and passages as these, rightly
   understood and duly considered, there is no standing for that doctrine
   which denies a possibility either of a total or of a final defection of
   the saints. But this light also is darkened in the heavens by the
   interposition of the veils of these two exceptions:-- 1. That the
   apostle in the said passages affirms nothing positively concerning the
   falling away of those he speaks of, but only conditionally and upon
   supposition. 2. That he doth not speak of true and sound believers, but
   of hypocrites, and such who had faith only in show, not in substance.
   The former of these exceptions hath been already non-suited, and that
   by some of the ablest patrons themselves of the cause of perseverance;
   where we were taught from a pen of that learning, that such conditional
   sayings upon which admonitions, promises, or threatenings are built, do
   at least suppose something in possibility, however, by virtue of their
   tenor and form, they suppose nothing in being.' But, --

   "As to the places in hand, there is not any hypothetical sign or
   conditional particle to be found in either of them as they come from
   the Holy Ghost and are carried in the original. Those two ifs'
   appearing in the English translation, the one in the former place, the
   other in the latter, show, it may be, the translators' inclination to
   the cause, but not their faithfulness in their engagement, -- an
   infirmity whereunto they were very subject, as we shall have occasion
   to take notice of the second time ere long, in another instance of the
   like partiality. But the tenor of both the passages in hand is so
   ordered by the apostle, that he plainly declares how great and fearful
   the danger is or will be when believers do or shall fall away, not if
   or in case they shall fall away."

   Ans. Of the two answers which, as himself signifieth, are usually given
   to the objections from these places of Scripture, that Mr Goodwin doth
   not fairly acquit his hands of either will quickly appear:--

   1. To the first, that the form of speech used by the apostle in both
   places is conditional, whence there is no argument to the event without
   begging the thing in question, or supposal that the condition in all
   respects may be fulfilled, where it requires only, to the constitution
   of it as a condition in the place of arguing wherein it is used, that
   it may be possible in some only, -- he opposeth, "That some of them who
   have wrote for the doctrine of the saints' perseverance' have
   disclaimed the use of it, as to its application to the place in Ezekiel
   formerly considered." But yet, leaving them to the liberty of their
   judgment who are so minded, that the reason given by them, and here
   again repeated by Mr Goodwin, doth not in the least enforce any to let
   go this answer to the objection proposed that shall be pleased to
   insist upon it, hath been manifested.

   To this Mr Goodwin farther adds that weighty observation, that the word
   "if" is not in the original; and thence takes occasion to fall foul
   upon the translators as having corrupted the passages, out of favour to
   the doctrine contended for. I wish they had never worse mistaken, nor
   showed more partiality in any other place. For, first, will Mr Goodwin
   say that a proposition cannot be hypothetical, nor an expression
   conditional, unless the word "if" be expressed? Were it worth the
   labour, instances might abundantly be given him in that language
   whereof we speak to the contrary. He that shall say to him as he is
   journeying, "Going the right hand way, you will meet with thieves," may
   be doubtless said to speak conditionally, no less than he that should
   expressly tell him, "If you go the way on the right hand, you shall
   meet with thieves." Secondly, what clear sense and significancy can be
   given the words without the supplement of the conditional conjunction,
   or some other term equipollent thereunto, Mr Goodwin hath not declared.
   "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened," etc., "and
   they falling away," as the words ("verbum de verbo") lie in the text,
   is scarce in English a congruous or significant expression; yea, kai
   parapesontas, in the syntax and coherence wherein it lies, is most
   properly and directly rendered, "If they fall away," as is also the
   force of the expression, chap. x. 26. Yea, thirdly, the corruption of
   the translation mentioned by Mr Goodwin doth not in the least relieve
   him as to the delivery of the words from a sense hypothetical. "When
   they fall away" (though his "when" be no more in the text than the
   translators' "if"), doth either include a supposition that they shall
   and must fall away certainly, and so requires the event of the thing
   whereof it is spoken, or it is expressive only of the condition whereon
   the event is suspended. If it be taken in the first sense, all
   believers must fall away; if in the latter, none may, notwithstanding
   any thing in this text (so learnedly restored to its true
   significancy), the words only pointing at the connection that is
   between apostasy and punishment. Notwithstanding, then, any thing here
   offered to the contrary, those who affirm that nothing can certainly be
   concluded from these places for the apostasy of any, be they who they
   will that are intended in them, because they are conditional
   assertions, manifesting only the connection between the sin and
   punishment expressed, need not be ashamed of nor recoil from their
   affirmation in the least.

   For mine own part, I confess I do not in any measure think it needful
   to insist upon the conditionals of these assertions of the Holy Ghost,
   as to the removal of any or all the oppositions that from them, of old
   or of late, have been raised and framed against the doctrine of the
   saints' perseverance, there being in neither of the texts insisted on
   either name or thing inquired after, nor any one of all the severals
   inquired into, and constantly in the Scriptures used, in the
   description of the saints and believers of whom we speak. This I shall
   briefly in the first place demonstrate, and then proceed with the
   consideration of what is offered by Mr Goodwin in opposition thereunto.
   Some few observations will lead us through the first part of this work
   designed. I say then, --

   1. There is an inferior, common work of the Holy Ghost, in the
   dispensation of the word, upon many to whom it is preached, causing in
   them a great alteration and change as to light, knowledge, abilities,
   gifts, affections, life, and conversation, when the persons so wrought
   upon are not quickened, regenerate, nor made new creatures, nor united
   to Jesus Christ. I suppose there will not be need for me to insist on
   the proof of this proposition, the truth of it being notoriously known
   and confessed, as I suppose, amongst all that profess the name of
   Christ.

   2. That in persons thus wrought upon, there is, or may be, such an
   assent, upon light and conviction, to the truths proposed and preached
   to them as is true in its kind, not counterfeit, giving and affording
   them in whom it is wrought profession of the faith, and that sometimes
   with constancy to the death, or the giving of their bodies to be
   burned, with persuasions (whence they are called "believers") of a
   future enjoyment of a glorious and blessed condition, and filling them
   with ravished affections and rejoicings in hope, which they profess
   suitable to the expectation they have of such a state and condition.
   This also might be easily evinced by innumerable instances and examples
   from the Scripture, if need required.

   3. That the persons in and upon whom this work is wrought cannot be
   said to be hypocrites in the most proper sense of that word, -- that
   is, such as counterfeit and pretend themselves to be that which they
   know they are not, -- nor to have faith only in show and not in
   substance, as though they made a show and pretence only of an assent to
   the things they professed; their high gifts, knowledge, faith, change
   of affections and conversation, being in their own kind true (as the
   faith of devils is): and yet, notwithstanding all this, they are in
   bondage, and at best seek for a righteousness as it were by the works
   of the law, and in the issue Christ proves to them of none effect.

   4. That among these persons many are oftentimes endued with excellent
   gifts, lovely parts, qualifications, and abilities, rendering them
   exceedingly useful, acceptable, and serviceable to the church of God,
   becoming vessels in his house to hold and convey to others the precious
   liquor of the gospel, though their nature in themselves be not changed,
   they remaining wood and stone still.

   5. That much of the work wrought in and upon this sort of persons by
   the Spirit and word lies, in its own nature, in a direct tendency to
   their relinquishment of their sins and self-righteousness, and to a
   closing with God in Christ, having a mighty prevalency upon them to
   cause them to amend their ways, and to labour after life and salvation;
   from which to apostatize and fall off, upon the account of the tendency
   mentioned of these beginnings, is dangerous, and for the most part
   pernicious.

   6. That persons under convictions and works of the Spirit formerly
   mentioned, partakers of the gifts, light, and knowledge spoken of, with
   those other endowments attending them, are capacitated for the sin
   against the Holy Ghost, or the unpardonable apostasy from God.

   These things being commonly known, and, as far as I know, universally
   granted, I affirm that the persons mentioned and intended in these
   places are such as have been now described, and not the believers or
   saints, concerning whom alone our contest is.

   Mr Goodwin replies, sect. 19, p. 283:--

   "To the latter exception, which pretends to find only hypocrites, and
   not true believers, staged in both passages, we likewise answer, that
   it glosseth no whit better than the former, if not much worse,
   considering that the persons presented in the said passages are
   described by such characters and signal excellencies which the
   Scriptures are wont to appropriate unto saints and true believers, and
   that when they intend to show them in the best and greatest of their
   glory. What we say herein will, I suppose, be made above all gainsaying
   by instancing particulars."

   Ans. That this is most remote from truth, and that there is not here
   any one discriminating character of true believers, so far are the
   expressions from setting them out in any signal eminency, will appear
   from these ensuing considerations:--

   1. There is no mention of faith or believing, either in express terms
   or in terms of an equivalent significancy, in either of the places
   mentioned; therefore true believers are not the persons intended to be
   described in these places. Did the Holy Ghost intend to describe
   believers, it is very strange that he should not call them so, nor make
   mention of any one of those principles in them from whence and whereby
   they are such. Wherefore, I say, --

   2. There is not any thing ascribed here to the persons spoken of which
   belongs peculiarly to true believers, as such, or that constitutes them
   to be such, and which yet are things plainly and positively asserted
   and described in innumerable other places of Scripture. That the
   persons described are "called according to the purpose of God,
   quickened, born again or regenerated, justified, united to Christ,
   sanctified by the Spirit, adopted, made sons of God," and the like,
   which are the usual expressions of believers, pointing out their
   discriminating form as such, is not in the least intimated in the text,
   context, or any concernment of it. That they are elected of God,
   redeemed of Christ, sanctified by the Spirit, that they are made holy,
   is not at all affirmed.

   3. The persons intended are, chap. vi., verses 7, 8, compared to the
   ground upon which the rain falls, and [which yet] beareth "thorns and
   briers." True believers, whilst they are so, are not such as do bring
   forth nothing but "thorns and briers," faith itself being an "herb meet
   for Him by whom they are dressed."

   4. "Things that accompany salvation" are "better things" than any
   [which] in the persons mentioned were to be found. This the apostle
   asserts, verse 9, "We are persuaded better things of you, and things
   that accompany salvation." Now, neither of these, neither "better
   things," nor "things that accompany salvation," were upon them whose
   apostasy the apostle supposeth. The exceptive particle at the entrance,
   with the apologetical design of the whole verse, ascribes such things
   to the saints, to whom the apostle speaks, as they were not partakers
   of concerning whom he had immediately before discoursed. The "faith of
   God's elect," whereby we are justified, is doubtless of the "things
   that accompany salvation."

   5. The persons intended by the apostle were such as "had need to be
   taught again the first principles of the oracles of God," chap. v. 12;
   that were "unskilful in the word of righteousness," verse 13; that had
   not their "senses exercised to discern both good and evil," verse 14;
   and are plainly distinguished from them to whom the promise made to
   Abraham doth properly belong, chap. vi. 9-14, etc.

   6. True believers are opposed, in the discourse of the apostle, chap.
   vi., unto these persons lying under a possibility of apostasy, so far
   as they are cast under it, by the conditional discourse of it, upon
   sundry accounts: as, of their "work and labour of love" showed to the
   name of God, verse 10; of their preservation, from the righteousness or
   faithfulness of God in his promises, verse 10; of the immutability of
   the counsel of God, and his oath for the preservation of them, verses
   13, 17, 18; of their sure and steadfast anchor of hope, verse 19, etc.
   Upon all which considerations, it is abundantly evident that they are
   not believers, the children of God, justified, sanctified, adopted,
   saints, of whom the apostle treats in the passages insisted on.

   Sect. 28, Mr Goodwin urges sundry reasons to prove that "they are not
   hypocrites or outside professors only, but true believers, that are
   described." If by "hypocrites and outside professors" he intends those
   who are grossly so, pretending to be what they are not, and what they
   know themselves not to be, we contend not about it. If in these
   expressions he compriseth also those whom we characterized in the
   entrance of this discourse, who unto their profession of the faith have
   also added those gifts and endowments, with the like, which we
   mentioned, but who, notwithstanding all their advancement in light,
   conviction, joy, usefulness, [and] conversation, do yet come short of
   union with Christ, I shall join issue with him in the consideration of
   his reasons offered to be "pregnant of proof" for the confirmation of
   his assertion. He tells you, sect. 28, p. 288:--

   "First, There is no clause, phrase, or word, in either of the places,
   any ways characteristical or descriptive of hypocrisy or hypocrites.
   There, are none of those colours to be seen which are wont to be used
   in drawing or limning the portraitures or shapes of those beasts, as
   distinguished from creatures of a better kind. All the lineaments of
   the persons presented in these tables, before the mention of their
   falling away, become the best and fairest faces of the saints (as hath
   been proved), and are not to be found in any other. Yea, the greatest
   and most intelligent believer under heaven hath no reason but to desire
   part and fellowship with the hypocrites' here described, in all those
   characters and properties which are attributed unto them before their
   falling away or sinning wilfully."

   Ans. 1. The design of the apostle is not to discover or give any
   characters of hypocrites, to manifest them to be such, but to declare
   the excellencies that are or may be found in them, from the enjoyment
   of all which they may decline, and sin against the mercy and grace of
   them, to the aggravation of their condemnation; neither had any lines
   used to particularize those "beasts" in their shape, wherein they
   differ from believers, been at all useful to the apostle's purpose, his
   aim being only to draw those wherein they are like them and conformable
   to them. Neither, --

   2. Is it questioned whether those things here mentioned may be found in
   true believers, and become them very well, rendering their faces
   beautiful; but whether there be not something else than what is here
   mentioned, that should give them being as such, and life, without which
   these things are little better than painting. Nor, --

   3. Is it at all to the purpose that believers may desire a
   participation in those characters with the persons described; but
   whether they who hare no other characters or marks upon them of true
   believers than what are here mentioned must necessarily be so
   accounted, or will of God be so accepted. Many a believer may desire
   the gifts of those hypocrites, who have not one dram of the grace
   wherewith he is quickened. So that this first reason, as pregnant as it
   seems of proof, is only indeed swelled and puffed up with wind and
   vanity. He adds, --

   "Secondly, True believers are in an estate of honour, and are lifted up
   on high towards the heavens; in which respect they have from whence to
   fall: but hypocrites are as near hell already as lightly they can be,
   till they be actually fallen into it; from whence, then, are they
   capable of falling? Men of estates may fail and break, but beggars are
   in no such danger. If hypocrites fall away, it must be from their
   hypocrisy; but this is rather a rising than a fall. A beggar cannot be
   said to break, but only when he gets an estate. When he doth this, the
   beggar is broke."

   Ans. All that here is added arises merely from the ambiguity of the
   word "hypocrites" The persons that fall are on all hands supposed to
   have and enjoy all that is made mention of in the texts insisted on; so
   that they have so much to fall from as that thereupon Mr Goodwin thinks
   them true believers. They have all the heights to tumble from which we
   before mentioned, and very many others that it is no easy task to
   declare. They fall from the excellencies they have, and not from the
   hypocrisy with which they are vitiated, -- from the profession of the
   faith, with honesty of conversation, etc., not from the want of root or
   being built on the rock. So that this pretended "pregnant reason" is as
   barren as the former to the proving of the assertion laid down to be
   proved by it. He adds, --

   "Thirdly, It is no punishment at all to hypocrites to be under no
   possibility of being renewed again by repentance:' nay, in case they
   should fall away,' it would be a benefit and blessing unto them to be
   under an impossibility of being renewed again;' for if this were their
   case, it would be impossible for them to be ever hypocrites again, and
   doubtless it is no great judgment upon any man to be incapable of such
   a preferment."

   Ans. Whether it be no punishment for them who have been in so good a
   way, a way of such tendency unto salvation and such usefulness to the
   gospel, as those persons are supposed to be in, not to be renewed again
   to that state and condition, but to be shut up unrecoverably under the
   power of darkness and unbelief unto eternal wrath, when before they
   were in a fair way for life and salvation, others will judge besides Mr
   Goodwin. Neither is there an affirmation of their falling away from
   their hypocrisy, and being renewed again thereunto, in any thing we
   assert in the exposition of this place, but their falling away from
   gifts and common graces, with the impossibility, of what kind soever it
   be, of being renewed to an enjoyment of them any more. His fourth and
   last attempt follows.

   "Fourthly, and lastly, It stands off forty foot at least from all
   probability, that the apostle, writing only unto those whom he judged
   true and sound believers (as appears from several places in the
   epistle, as chap. iii. 14, vi. 9, etc.), should, in the most serious,
   emphatical, and weighty passages hereof, admonish them of such evils or
   dangers which only concerned other men, and whereunto themselves were
   not at all obnoxious; yea, and whereunto if they had been obnoxious,
   all the cautions, admonitions, warnings, threatenings in the world,
   would not (according to their principles with whom we have now to do)
   have relieved or delivered them. To say that such admonitions are a
   means to preserve those from apostasy who are by other means (as
   suppose the absolute decree of God, or the interposal of his
   irresistible power for their perseverance, or the like) in no
   possibility of apostatizing, is to say that washing is a means to make
   snow white, or the rearing up of a pillar in the air a means to keep
   the heavens from falling. But more of this in the chapter following."

   Ans. What exact measure soever Mr Goodwin seemeth to have taken of the
   distance of our assertion from "all probability" (which he hath
   accurately performed, if we may take his word), yet, upon due
   consideration, it evidently appears that he is not able to disprove it
   from coming close up to the absolute truth of the meaning and scope of
   the Holy Ghost in the places under consideration: for, besides what
   hath been already argued and proved, it is evident, --

   1. That the apostle wrote promiscuously to all that profess the name of
   Christ and his gospel; of whom he tells you, chap. iii. 14 (one of the
   places we are directed to by Mr Goodwin), that those only are made
   "partakers of Christ who hold the beginning of their confidence
   steadfast unto the end;" [as] for the rest, notwithstanding all their
   glorious profession, gifts, and attainments, yet they are not truly
   made partakers of Christ (whereby he cuts the throat of Mr Goodwin's
   whole cause); and chap. vi. 9, that there were amongst them [those] who
   had attained "things accompanying salvation," and "better things" than
   any of those had done, who, notwithstanding their profession, yet held
   it not fast without wavering, but every day fell away: so that though
   he judged no particulars before their apostasy, yet he partly intimates
   that all professors were not true believers; and therefore does teach
   them all to make sure work in closing with Christ, lest they turn
   apostates, and perish in so doing.

   2. That conditional comminations and threatenings, discovering the
   connection that is between the antecedent and consequent that is in the
   proposition of them, are and may be of use to the saints of God,
   preserved from the end threatened and the cause deserving it, upon the
   accounts, reasons, and causes, that have been plentifully insisted on,
   hath more than once been declared, and the objections to the contrary
   (the same with those here insisted on) answered and removed. This being
   all that Mr Goodwin hath to offer by the way of reason to exclude the
   persons formerly described to be the only concernment of the places of
   Scripture insisted on, there remains nothing but only the consideration
   of the severals of the passages debated; wherein, by the light that
   hath already broken forth from the circumstances, aims, ends, and
   connection of the places, we may so far receive direction as not to be
   at all stumbled in our progress.

   With the consideration of the several expressions in the passages under
   debate Mr Goodwin proceedeth, sect. 19, and first insisteth on that of
   chap. vi. 4, where it is said that they were hapax photisthentes, "once
   enlightened;" whence he thus argues:--

   "Believers are said to be enlightened,' and to be children of light,'
   and to be light in the Lord,' 2 Cor. iv. 6; Heb. x. 32; Luke xvi. 8;
   Eph. v. 8: therefore they who here are said to be enlightened' were
   true believers."

   Ans. 1. I shall not insist upon the various interpretations of this
   place, and readings of the word photisthentes, very many, and that not
   improbably, affirming that their participation of the ordinance of
   baptism is here only intended by it; for which exposition much might be
   offered, were it needful or much conducing to our business in hand.
   Nor, --

   2. Shall I labour to manifest that persons may be enlightened, and yet
   never come to Christ savingly by faith, to attain union with him and
   justification by him; -- a thing Mr Goodwin will not deny himself; or
   if he should, it were a very facile thing to convince him of his
   mistake by a sole entreaty (if he would be pleased to give an account
   of his faith in this business at our entreaty) of him to declare what
   he intends by "illumination;" whence it would quickly appear how
   unsuitable it is to his own principles to deny that it may be in them
   who yet never come to be, or at least by virtue thereof may not be said
   to be, true believers. But this only I shall add, --

   3. That Mr Goodwin, doubtless knowing that this argument (which, with
   all the texts of Scripture whereby he illustrates it, he borrows of the
   Remonstrants) hath been again and again excepted against as illogical
   and unconcluding, and inconsistent with the principles of them that use
   it, ought not crudely again to have imposed it upon his reader without
   some attempt at least to free it from the charge of impertinency,
   weakness, and folly, wherewith it is burdened. "Illumination is
   ascribed to believers; illumination is ascribed to these men: therefore
   these persons are believers." A little consideration will recover to Mr
   Goodwin's mind the force of this argument, so far as that he will
   scarce use it any more.

   Sect. 20, he takes up another expression, from chap. x. 26, that they
   are said to receive epignosin tes aletheias, -- "the acknowledgment of
   the truth;" whence he argues in the same manner and form as he had
   newly done from the term of "illumination." Epignosis aletheias is
   ascribed to believers; therefore they are all so to whom it is
   ascribed.

   But he tells you, in particular, sect. 20, "That, in the latter of the
   said passages, the persons spoken of are said to have received
   epignosin tes aletheias, -- that is, the acknowledgment of the truth;'
   which expression doth not signify the bare notion of what the gospel
   teacheth, of which they are capable who are the most professed enemies
   thereof, but such a consenting and subjection thereunto which worketh
   effectually in men to a separating of themselves from sin and sinners.
   This is the constant import of the phrase in the Scriptures."

   Ans. All this may be granted, yet nothing hence concluded to evince the
   persons to whom it is ascribed to be true believers. Men may be so
   wrought upon and convinced by the word and Spirit, sent forth to
   "convince the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment," as to
   acknowledge the truth of the gospel, to profess subjection to the
   gospel, and to yield to it so far as to separate themselves from sin
   and sinners, in such a manner and to such a degree (not dissembling,
   hut answering their convictions) as to bless themselves oftentimes in
   their own condition, and to obtain an esteem with the people of God to
   be such indeed as they profess themselves to be, and yet come short of
   that union and communion with the Lord Christ which all true believers
   are made partakers of. It is not of any use or importance to examine
   the particular places mentioned by Mr Goodwin, wherein, as be
   supposeth, the expression of the "knowledge" or "acknowledgment of the
   truth" denotes that which is saving, and comprehendeth true faith,
   unless he had attempted to prove from them that the word could signify
   nothing else, or that a man might not be brought to an acknowledgment
   of the truth but that he must of necessity be a true believer; neither
   of which he doth, or if he did, could he possibly give any seeming
   probability to. There may be a knowing, of the things of the gospel in
   men, and yet they may come short of the happiness of them that do them;
   there is a knowledge of Christ that yet is barren as to the fruit of
   holiness.

   In the next place, the persons queried about are said to be "sanctified
   by the blood of the covenant." Of this Mr Goodwin says, sect. 21, "That
   is, by their sprinkling herewith, to be separated from such who refuse
   this sprinkling, as likewise from the pollutions and defilements of the
   world. To be sanctified,' when applied unto persons, is not found in
   any other sense throughout the New Testament, unless it be where
   persons bear the consideration of things, 1 Cor. vii. 14. But of this
   signification of the word, which we claim in this place, instances are
   so frequent and obvious that we shall not need to mention any."

   Ans. 1. If no more be intended in this expression but what Mr Goodwin
   gives us in the exposition of it, -- namely, that they are so sprinkled
   with it as to be "separated from them that refuse this sprinkling"
   (that is openly), "as likewise from the pollutions and defilements of
   the world," -- we shall not need to contend about it; for men may be so
   sprinkled, and have such an efficacy of conviction come upon them by
   the preaching of the cross and blood-shedding of Christ, as to be
   separated from those who professedly despise it and the open
   publication of the word, and yet be far from having "consciences purged
   from dead works to serve the living God." And, --

   2. That the term of "sanctifying," when applied to persons, is not used
   in any other sense than what is by Mr Goodwin here expressed, is an
   assertion that will be rendered useless until Mr Goodwin be pleased to
   give it an edge by explaining in what sense he here intends to apply
   it. Of the term "sanctifying" there are, as hath been declared, two
   more eminent and known significations:-- First, To separate from common
   use, state, or condition, to dedicate, consecrate, and set apart to
   God, by profession of his will, in a peculiar manner, is frequently so
   expressed. Secondly, Really to purify, cleanse with spiritual purity,
   opposed to the defilement of sin, is denoted thereby. In the exposition
   given of the place here used by Mr Goodwin, he mentions both, --
   separation, and that chiefly, as the nature of the sanctification
   whereof he speaks, as also some kind of spiritual cleansing from sin;
   but in what sense he precisely would have us to understand him he doth
   not tell us.

   I somewhat question whether it be used in the Epistle to the Hebrews in
   any other sense than the former, which was the Temple sense of the
   word, the apostle using many terms of the old worship in their first
   signification; -- however, that it is used in that sense in the New
   Testament, appropriated to persons, without any such respect as that
   mentioned by Mr Goodwin, is sufficiently evinced by that of our
   Saviour, John xvii. 19, huper auton ego hagiazo emauton, expressing his
   dedicating and separating himself to his office; and more instances may
   be had, if we stood in any need of them.

   3. That many are said to be sanctified and holy in the latter sense, as
   it signifieth spiritual purity, in respect of their profession of
   themselves so to be, and some men's esteem of them, who yet were never
   wholly and truly purged from their sin, nor ever had received the Holy
   Spirit of promise, who alone is able to purge their hearts, doth not
   now want its demonstration; that work hath been some while since
   performed. So that Mr Goodwin makes not any progress at all in the
   proof of what he has undertaken, -- namely, that they are true
   believers, in the sense of that denomination which we assert, who in
   these places are described. For a close, en ho hemiasthe is far more
   properly referred to Christ than to the persons spoken of; and that
   sense the Remonstrants themselves do not oppose.

   That they are said, chap. vi. 4, to have "tasted of the heavenly gift"
   is urged in the next place, sect. 22, to prove them true believers.
   Both the object and the act are here in question, -- what is meant by
   the "heavenly gift," and what by "tasting" of it. I shall not look into
   the text beyond the peculiar concernment of the cause in hand; somewhat
   might be offered for the farther clearing of the one and other. At
   present it sufficeth, that, be the "heavenly gift" what it will, the
   persons of our contest are said only to "taste" of it; which, though
   absolutely and in itself it is not an extenuating expression, but
   denotes a matter of high aggravation of the sin of apostasy, in that
   they were admitted to some taste and relish of the excellency and
   sweetness of the heavenly gift, yet comparatively to their feeding on
   it, digesting it, growing thereby, it clearly denotes their coming
   short of such a participation of it who do but taste of it. That to
   taste doth not, in the first genuine signification, in things natural,
   signify to eat and digest meat, so as to grow by it, I suppose needs no
   proof: that in that sense it is used in the Scriptures, John ii. 9,
   Matt. xxvii. 34, is by Mr Goodwin confessed. This he tells you "is only
   when the taste or relish of things is desired to be known;" but that
   our Saviour tasted of the gall and vinegar out of a desire to know the
   relish of it, he will hardly persuade those who are accustomed to give
   never so easy a belief to his assertions. By the "heavenly gift" Mr
   Goodwin in the first place intends Jesus Christ. Now, if by tasting,
   eating and drinking of Christ be intended, as is here pleaded, Christ
   himself will determine this strife, telling us that whosoever eateth
   his flesh shall be saved, John vi. 35, 49-51, 53-57. So that either to
   taste is not to eat, or they that taste cannot perish.

   Three things are urged by Mr Goodwin to give proof of his
   interpretation of these words of the Holy Ghost. Saith he:--

   1. "Whatsoever is meant by this heavenly gift,' certain is it that by
   tasting' is not meant any light or superficial impression made upon the
   hearts or souls of men, through the sense or apprehension of it, but an
   emphatical, inward, and affectuous relish and sense of the excellent
   and heavenly sweetness and pleasantness of it, opposed to a bare
   speculation or naked apprehension thereof. The reason hereof is clear,
   viz., because the tasting of this heavenly gift here spoken of is not
   mentioned by the apostle in a way of easing or extenuating the sin of
   those that should fall away from Christ, but by way of aggravation and
   exaggeration of the heinousness and unreasonableness thereof, and
   withal more fully to declare and assert the equitableness of that
   severity in God which is here denounced against those that shall sin
   the great sin of apostasy here spoken of. It must needs be much more
   unworthy and provoking in the sight of God for a man to turn his back
   upon and renounce those ways, that profession, wherein God hath come
   home to him, and answered the joy of his heart abundantly, than it
   would be in case he had only heard of great matters, and had his head
   filled, but had really found and felt nothing with his heart and soul
   truly excellent and glorious.

   2. "And besides, the very word itself, to taste, ordinarily in
   Scripture imports a real communion with, or participation and enjoyment
   (if the thing be good) of, that which was said to be tasted. O taste
   and see,' saith David, that the Lord is good,' Ps. xxxiv. 8. His
   intent, doubtless, was, not to invite men to a slight or superficial
   taste of the goodness of God, but to a real, cordial, and thorough
   experiment and satisfactory enjoyment of it. So when he that made the
   great invitation in the parable expressed himself thus to his servants,
   For I say unto you, That none of those which were bidden shall taste of
   my supper,' Luke xiv. 24, his meaning clearly was, that they should not
   partake of the sweetness and benefit with those who should accept of
   his invitation and come unto it. In like manner, when Peter speaketh
   thus to his Christian Jews, If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is
   gracious,' 1 Pet. ii. 3, his meaning (questionless) is, not to press
   his exhortation, directed unto them in the former verse, upon a
   consideration of any light or vanishing taste, such as hypocrites and
   false-hearted Christians may have, of the graciousness of the Lord, but
   of such a taste wherein they had had a real, inward, and sensible
   experiment thereof.

   3. "And besides, according to the sense of our adversaries in the
   present debate, if the taste of the heavenly gift we speak of should
   imply no more but only a faint or weak perception of the sweetness and
   glorious excellency of it, yet even this may be sufficient to evince
   truth of grace and faith in men: for their opinion is, that a man may
   be a true believer with a grain of mustard-seed only, -- that is, with
   a very slender relish and taste of spiritual things; yea, their sense
   is, that in some cases of desertion, and under the guilt of some
   enormous courses, they may have little or no taste of them at all."

   Ans. To the first discourse, considering what hath been already
   delivered, I shall only add, that although it be no aggravation of the
   sin of apostasy that they who fall into it have but "tasted of the
   heavenly gift," yet it is that they have tasted of it. That taste of
   its relish, preciousness, and sweetness, which they have obtained,
   whereby they are distinguished from them whose blindness and hardness
   keep them up to a total disrelish and contempt of it, is abundantly
   enough to render their sin heinous and abominable. When men, by the
   preaching of the word, shall be startled in their sins, troubled in
   their consciences, forced to seek out for a remedy, and shall come so
   far as to have some (though but a light) taste of the excellency of the
   gospel and the remedy provided for sinners in Jesus Christ; and then,
   through the strength of their lusts and corruptions, shall cast it off,
   reject it, and spit out of their mouth, as it were, all that of it
   whereby they found the least savour in it, -- no creature under heaven
   can be guilty of more abominable undervaluing of the Lord Christ and
   the love of God in him than such persons. What degree of love, joy,
   repentance, peace, faith, persons many times arrive unto, when, with
   Herod, they have "heard the word gladly, and done many things
   willingly," etc., hath been by others abundantly demonstrated. This
   sufficeth our present purpose, that they do make such a progress in the
   ways of God, and find so much excellency in the treasure of grace and
   mercy which he hath provided in Jesus Christ, and [which he] tenders in
   the gospel, that he cannot but look upon their apostasy and
   renunciation of him (whereby they proclaim to all the world, as much as
   in them lies, that there is not that real goodness, worth, and
   excellency to be found in him as some pretend) as the highest scorn and
   contempt of him and his love in Christ; and [he] revenges it
   accordingly.

   To the second, which consists of instances collected by the
   Remonstrants to manifest the use of the word "tasting" to be other than
   what we here confine it to, I say, first, that the word, as it is
   applied to spirituals, being borrowed and metaphorical, not in its
   analogy to be extended beyond making trial for our coming to some
   knowledge of a thing in its nature, the use of it in one place cannot
   prescribe to the sense of it in another, no more than any other
   metaphorical expression whatever; but it must, in the several places of
   its residence, be interpreted according to the most peculiar
   restriction that the matter treated of doth require. If, then, Mr
   Goodwin can prove that any thing in this place under consideration
   enforces such a sense, all his other instances are needless; if he
   cannot, they are useless.

   It might easily be manifested, and hath been done by others already,
   that in all the places mentioned by Mr Goodwin, the word is not
   expressly significant of any thorough, solid eating and participation
   of that which is said to be tasted, as is pretended. But to manifest
   this is not our concernment, there being no reason in the world to
   enforce any such sense as is contended for in the place under present
   consideration.

   To the third, wherein he argues, with his predecessors, from our
   opinion concerning faith, a brief reply will suffice. That "a faint,
   weak perception and relish of heavenly things," is sufficient to make a
   man a believer, is so far from being our opinion that we utterly
   disclaim them from being believers to whom this is ascribed, if nothing
   else be added in their description from whence they may be so esteemed.
   It is true, faith is sometimes little and weak in the exercise of it;
   yea, a man may be so overtaken with temptations, or so clouded under
   desertions, as that it may not deport itself with any such considerable
   vigour as to be consolatory to him in whom it is, or demonstrative of
   him unto others to be what he is: but we say, that the weakest, lowest,
   meanest measure and degree of this faith, is yet grounded and fixed in
   the heart, where, though it be not always alike lively and active, yet
   it is always alive and gives life. How far believers may fall into the
   guilt of "enormous courses" has been already manifested. The intendment
   of the expression is to disadvantage the persuasion he opposeth. We do
   not grant that believers may fall into any enormities, but only what
   God himself affirms they may, and yet not utterly be cast out of his
   love and favour in Jesus Christ. Farther; the weakest faith of which we
   affirm that it may be true and saving, though it may have no great
   perception nor deep taste of heavenly things for the present, yet hath
   always that of adherence to God in Christ; which is exceedingly exalted
   above any such perception of heavenly things whatever that may be had
   or obtained without it. So that, from the consideration of what hath
   been spoken, we may safely conclude that Mr Goodwin hath not been able
   to advance one step in his intendment to prove that the persons here
   described are true believers.

   I know no sufficient ground or reason to induce me to any large
   consideration of the other two or three expressions that remain, and
   that are insisted on by Mr Goodwin, seeing it is evident from their
   associates, which have been already examined, that there is none of
   them can speak one word to the business in hand. I shall therefore
   discharge them from any farther attendance in the service they have
   been forced unto.

   The next privilege insisted on which to these persons is ascribed is,
   that they are "made partakers of the Holy Ghost." In men's
   participation of the Holy Ghost, either the gifts or graces of the Holy
   Ghost are intended. The graces of the Holy Ghost are either more common
   and inchoative, or special and completing of the work of conversion.
   That it is the peculiar, regenerating grace of God that is intended in
   this expression, of being "made partakers of the Holy Ghost," and not
   the gifts of the Spirit, or those common graces of illumination, unto
   which persons not truly converted, but only wrought upon by an
   effectual conviction in the preaching of the word, may attain, Mr
   Goodwin is no way able to prove. And there is also this consideration
   rising up with strength and power against that interpretation, namely,
   that those that are so made partakers of the Spirit as to be
   regenerated, quickened, sealed, comforted thereby, -- which are some of
   the peculiar acts of his grace in and towards the souls of those that
   believe, -- can never lose him nor be deprived of him (as was
   manifested before at large), being sealed and confirmed not only in the
   present enjoyment of the love and favour of God, but also unto the full
   fruition of the glory which is provided for them; and therefore [they]
   cannot fall away, as these are supposed to do. What there is in Mr
   Goodwin's discourse on this passage, sect. 23, 24, to weaken in the
   least what is usually answered, or farther to enforce his exposition of
   the place, I am not able to apprehend, and shall therefore proceed with
   what remaineth.

   All that follows in the place of the apostle under contest is regulated
   by the word "taste:" "They have tasted the good word of God, and the
   powers of the world to come." What the sense and importance of that
   word is hath been already declared; neither can it be proved that the
   persons here described do so "taste the good word of God" as to mix the
   promises of it with faith, or of the "powers of the world to come" as
   to receive them in power in their hearts by believing: so that farther
   contest about these words seems to be altogether needless.

   How far men may proceed in the ways of God; what progress they may make
   in amendment of life; what gifts and common graces they may receive;
   what light and knowledge they may be endued withal; what kind of faith,
   joy, repentance, sorrow, delight, love, they may have in and about
   spiritual things; what desires of mercy and heaven; what useful gifts
   for the church's edification they may receive; how far they may
   persuade their own souls, and upon what grounds, that their condition
   God-ward is good and saving, and beget an opinion in others that they
   are true believers, -- and yet come short of union with Christ,
   building their houses on the sand, etc., is the daily task of the
   preachers of the gospel to manifest, in their pressing that exhortation
   of the apostle unto their hearers, to "examine and try themselves," in
   the midst of their profession, "whether Christ be in them of a truth"
   or no. I shall not now enter upon that labour. The reader knows where
   to find enough, in the writings of holy and learned men of this nation,
   to evince that men may arrive at the utmost height of what is in this
   place of the apostle by the Holy Ghost ascribed to the persons of whom
   he speaks, and yet come short of the state of true believers. Mr
   Goodwin, indeed, tells us, sect. 27, --

   "The premises relating to the two passages yet under debate considered,
   I am so far from questioning whether the apostle speaks of true and
   sound believers in them, that I verily judge that he purposely sought
   out several of the most emphatical and signal characters of believers,
   yea, such which are hardly, or rather not at all, to be found in the
   ordinary sort of true believers, but only in those that are most
   eminent amongst them; -- that so he might give them to understand and
   consider that not true believers only, and such who though sound yet
   were weak in the faith, might fall away and perish, but that even such
   also who were lifted up nearer unto heaven than their fellows might,
   through carelessness and carnal security, dash themselves in pieces
   against the same stone, and make shipwreck of their souls as well as
   they."

   Ans. 1. The house built on the sand may oftentimes be built higher,
   have more fair parapets and battlements, windows, and ornaments, than
   that which is built upon the rock; yet all gifts and privileges equal
   not one grace. In respect of light, knowledge, gifts, and many
   manifestations of the Spirit, such who never come up to that faith
   which gives real union and communion with Jesus Christ may far outgo
   those that do.

   2. That there is any thing mentioned or any characters given believers,
   much less such as are singular and not common to all, Mr Goodwin hath
   not in any measure been able to evince. There is not the meanest
   believer in the world but he is a child of God, and heir of the
   promises, and brother of the Lord Christ; hath union with him; hath his
   living in him; is quickened, justified, sanctified; hath Christ made to
   him wisdom, etc.; hath his righteousness in God, and his life hid in
   him in Christ; is passed from death to life, brings forth fruit; and is
   dear to God as the apple of his eye, accepted with him, approved of him
   as his temple, wherein he delighteth to dwell. That any thing in this
   place mentioned and insisted on, any characters we have given of the
   persons whom we have considered, do excel, or equal, or denote any
   thing in the same kind with these and the like excellencies of the
   meanest believers, will never be proved, if we may judge of future
   successes from the issue of all former attempts for that end and
   purpose.

   And this is the issue of Mr Goodwin's third testimony produced to
   confirm the doctrine of the saints' apostasy, but hypothetically, and
   under such a form of expression as may not be argued from, nor of
   saints and true believers at all. His fourth followeth.

   His fourth testimony he produceth, and endeavours to manage for the
   advantage of his cause, sect. 31, in these words:--

   "The next Scripture testimony we shall produce and briefly urge in the
   cause now under maintenance is in the same epistle with the former, and
   speaketh these words: Now, the just shall live by faith; but if any man
   draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.' Our English
   translators, out of good-will, doubtless, to a bad cause, have almost
   defaced this testimony, by substituting any man' for the just man:' for
   whereas they translate, But if any man draw back,' the original
   readeth, Kai ean huposteiletai; that is, And if,' or But if he,' that
   is, the just man, who should live by his faith, namely, if he continues
   in it, shall draw back.' Beza himself likewise, before them, had
   stained the honour of his faithfulness with the same blot in his
   translation. But the mind of the Holy Ghost in the words is plain and
   without parable, namely, that If the just man, who lives,' -- that is,
   who at present enjoys the favour of God, and thereby is supported in
   all his trials, -- and should live always, by his faith,' if he
   continues in it, as Paræus well glosseth, shall draw back,' or shall be
   withdrawn, namely, through fear or sloth (as the word properly
   signifieth, see Acts xx. 27), from his believing, my soul shall have no
   pleasure in him;' that is (according to the import of the Hebraism), my
   soul shall hate or abhor him to death;' as it is also expounded in the
   words immediately following, But we are not of them who draw back unto
   perdition, but,' etc. From hence, then, evident it is that such a man
   who is a just or righteous man, and under promise of living for ever by
   his faith (and therefore also a true and sound believer), may draw
   back, or be withdrawn, to the contracting of the hatred of God, and to
   destruction in the end. The forlorn hope of evading, because the
   sentence is hypothetical or conditional, not positive, hath been routed
   over and over, yea, and is abandoned by some of the great masters
   themselves of that cause unto the defence whereof it pretendeth. And,
   however, in this place, it would be most preposterous; for if it should
   be supposed that the just man, who is in a way and under a promise of
   living by his faith, were in no danger or possibility of drawing back,
   and that to the loss of the favour of God and ruin of his soul, God
   must be conceived to speak here at no better rate of wisdom or
   understanding than this: The just shall live by his faith; but if he
   shall do that which is simply and utterly impossible for him to do, my
   soul shall have no pleasure in him.' What savour of wisdom, yea, or of
   common sense, is there in admonishing or cautioning men against such
   evils which there is no possibility for them to fall into, yea, and
   this known unto themselves. Therefore this testimony, for confirmation
   of the doctrine we maintain, is like a king upon his throne, against
   whom there is no rising up."

   Ans. What small cause Mr Goodwin hath to quarrel with Beza or other
   translators, and with how little advantage to his cause this text is
   produced, shall out of hand be made appear:--

   1. The words as they cry are, Ho de dikaios ek pisteos zesetai; kai ean
   huposteiletai, ouk eudokei he psuche mou en auto; hemeis de ouk esmen
   hupostoles eis apoleian, alla pisteos eis peripoiesin psuches. In the
   foregoing part of the chapter, the apostle had treated of two sorts of
   persons:-- (1.) Such as, to forsake the assemblies of the saint,
   withdrew from the church and ordinances of Christ, and so by degrees
   fell off with a total and everlasting backsliding Of these the apostle
   speaks, describing their ways and end, from verse 25 unto verse 31.
   Thence forward (2.) he speaks to them and of them who abode, in their
   persecutions and under all their afflictions, to hold fast their
   confidence; which he also father exhorts them to, that, by patient
   abiding in well-doing, they might receive the reward. Concerning both
   these, having told them of the unshaken kingdom of Christ that should
   be brought in, notwithstanding the apostasy of many, on whose iniquity
   God would take vengeance, he lays down that eminent promise of the
   gospel, "The just by faith shall live;" words often used to express the
   state and condition of believers, -- of those who are truly and
   unfeignedly so. The Lord being faithful in his promise, "the justified
   person shall live," or obtain life everlasting. It is the promise of
   eternal life that is here given them, as that which they had not as yet
   received, but in patience they were to wait to receive, after they had
   done the whole will of God. That any of these should so "draw back" as
   that the Lord's "soul should have no pleasure in them," is directly
   contrary to the promise here made of their living. The particle kai in
   the next words is plainly adversative and exceptive, as it is very many
   times in the New Testament, and that to the persons of whom he is
   speaking. At zesetai, the period is full, the description of the state
   of the just by faith is completed; and in the next words the state of
   backsliders is entered upon, kai ean uposteiletai referring to them,
   whom by their apostasy and subduction of themselves from Christian
   assemblies he had before descried. There is an ellipsis in the words,
   to be supplied by some indefinite term, to give them the sense
   intended. This Beza and our translators have done by that excepted
   against, causelessly, by Mr Goodwin; for if a translator may make the
   text speak significantly in the language whereinto he translates it,
   the introduction of such supplements is allowed him.

   2. The following expression puts it out of all question that this was
   the intendment of the apostle; for he expressly makes mention, and that
   in reference to what was spoken before, of two sorts of people, to whom
   his former expressions are respectively to be accommodated. The words
   are, hemeis de ouk, k. t. l., as above. Mr Goodwin, to make us believe
   that he took notice of these words, hath this passage of them, "As it
   is also expounded in the words immediately following, But we are not of
   them who draw back unto perdition, but,' etc." But what, I pray, is
   expounded in these words, "that drawers back shall be destroyed"? This
   is all he takes notice of in them. Evidently the words are an
   application of the former assertions unto several persons. There are,
   says he, some who are tes hupostoles, and some that are tes pisteos.
   Those, saith he, who are tes hupostoles, they shall be destroyed; those
   who are tes pisteos, they shall live; -- evidently and beyond all
   contradiction assigning his former assertions of "The just shall live
   by faith," and "If any man draw back," to several persons, by a
   distribution of their lot and portions to them. In verse 38 he lays
   down in thesis the state and condition of believers and backsliders. In
   verse 39 he makes application of the position he laid down to himself
   and them: (1.) Negatively, that they were not of the former sort, "of
   them that draw back," etc.; (2.) Positively, that they were of the
   rest, of "them that believe." And these expressions, verse 39, Ouk
   esmen hupostoles alla pisteos, do undeniably affirm two sorts of
   persons in both places to be spoken of, and that ean huposteiletai can
   by no means be referred to our dikaios, which would intermix them whom
   the apostle, as to their present state and future condition, held out
   in a contradistinction one to the other unto the end. All that ensues
   in Mr Goodwin's discourse being built upon this sandy foundation, that
   it is the believer, of whom God affirms that he "shall live by faith,"
   who is supposed to be tes hupostoles, contrary to the express assertion
   of the apostle, it needs no farther consideration, although he is not
   able to manifest any strength in conclusion drawn from suppositions of
   events which may be possible in one sense and in another impossible.

   But before we pass farther, may not this witness, which Mr Goodwin hath
   attempted in vain to suborn to appear and speak in his cause, be
   demanded what he can speak, or what he knows of the truth of that which
   he is produced to oppose? This, then, it confesseth and denieth not, at
   first word, that of professors there are two sorts: some are
   hupostoles, of such as do or may "draw back unto perdition;" some
   pisteos, which "believe to the saving of the soul," and that in
   opposition to the others. Also, that those who withdraw are not
   pisteos, not true believers, nor ever were, notwithstanding all their
   profession, and what [ever] their gifts and attainments in and under
   their profession. So that the testimony produced keepeth still its
   place, and is "as a king upon his throne, against whom there is no
   rising up," but yet speaks quite contrary, clearly, evidently,
   distinctly, to what is pretended. Both on the one hand and the other is
   our thesis undeniably confirmed in this place of the apostle: If all
   those who fall away to perdition were never truly or really of the
   faith, then those who are of the faith cannot fall away; but they who
   fall away to perdition were never truly or really of the faith, or true
   believers: ergo. The reason of the consequent of the first proposition
   is evident; for their not being of the faith is plainly included as the
   reason of their apostasy, and their being of the faith intimated as
   that which would have preserved them from such defection. The minor is
   the apostle's, We are not hupostoles, of them that draw back, but of
   them that believe;' which plainly distinguisheth them that draw back
   from believers. Again: if true believers shall live, and continue to
   the saving of their souls, in opposition to them that fall away to
   perdition, then they shall certainly persevere in their faith, for
   these two are but one and the same; but that true believers shall live,
   and believe to the saving of their souls, in opposition to them that
   draw back, or subduct themselves, to perdition, is the assertion of the
   Holy Ghost: ergo. I presume by this time Mr G. is plainly convinced
   that indeed he had as good (yea, and much better, for the advantage of
   his cause in hand) have let his witness have abode in quietness, and
   not entreated him so severely [as] to [make him] denounce judgment
   against that doctrine which he seeks by him to confirm.

   Sect. 32. The parable of the stony ground, Matt. xiii. 20, 21, comes
   next for consideration. The words chosen to be insisted on are in the
   verses mentioned, "But he that received the seed into stony places, the
   same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it: yet
   hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while," etc. That by the
   stony ground is meant true believers is that which Mr Goodwin
   undertakes to prove; but how, in his whole discourse, I profess I
   perceive not. I must take leave to profess that I cannot find any thing
   looking like a proof or argument to evince it, from the beginning to
   the end of this discourse, though something be offered to take off the
   arguments that are used to prove it to be otherwise. Doth Mr Goodwin
   think that men will easily believe that faith which hath neither root,
   fruit, nor continuance, to be true and saving faith? Doubtless, they
   must have very low apprehensions of saving faith, union with Christ,
   justification, sanctification, adoption, etc., wherewith it is
   attended, who can once entertain any such imagination. That which is
   tendered to induce us to such a persuasion may briefly be considered.

   Saith he, sect 32, "Now, those signified by the stony ground he
   expressly calleth proskairous, that is, persons who continue for a time
   or a season, -- that is (as Luke explaineth), hoi pros kairon
   pisteuousi, who "believe for a season:" so that those who only for a
   time believe, and afterward make defection from Christ and from the
   gospel, are nevertheless numbered and ranked by him amongst believers.
   The words in Luke are very particular: They on the rock are they,
   which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no
   root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away;'
   -- from whence it appears that the bearers here described are not
   compared to the rock or stony ground for the hardness of their hearts,
   forasmuch as they are said to "receive the word with joy," which argues
   an ingenuity and teachableness of spirit in them, and is elsewhere
   (namely, Acts ii. 41) taken knowledge of by the Holy Ghost as an index
   or sign of a true believer; but for such a property, disposition, or
   temper as this, namely, not to give or afford the word so received a
   radication in their hearts and souls, so intimous, serious, and solid,
   which should be sufficient to maintain their belief of it, and good
   affections to it, against all such occurrences in the world which may
   oppose or attempt either the one or the other."

   Ans. 1. The first reason intimated is, "That they are said to be
   proskairoi," a term given them, plainly, to distinguish them from true
   believers, -- men that make a profession for a season, expressly
   opposed to them who receive the word "in honest and good hearts." If
   the word had denoted any excellency, any thing that was good in them,
   then there had been some pretence to have insisted on it to prove them
   true believers; but to demonstrate the truth of their faith from their
   hypocrisy, and their excellencies from that which expressly denotes
   their unworthiness, is a strange way of arguing. "They are persons,"
   saith our Saviour, "that make profession for a little while, and then
   decay; not like them who receive the word in honest and good hearts:"
   "Therefore," saith Mr Goodwin, "they are true believers." But, --

   2. "In Luke they are said to believe for a season.'?" Mr Goodwin is not
   now to learn how often in the Scripture they are said to believe who
   only profess the faith of the gospel, though the root of the matter be
   not in them. That of John ii. 23-25 may suffice for undeniable
   instance, or John vi. 66 may farther expound it. Their believing for a
   season is but the lifeless, worthless, fruitless profession for a
   season, as their distinction from the good ground doth manifest, But,
   --

   3. "They are said to receive the word with joy,' which argues ingenuity
   and teachableness of spirit in them." No more than in Herod, who "heard
   the word gladly;" or in the Jews, when the preaching of Ezekiel was
   "pleasant" or desirable to them; or in those described Isa. lviii. 2,
   who "sought God daily, and delighted to know his ways," in the midst of
   their abominable practices.

   From the similitude itself he yet farther attempts this uncouth
   assertion:--

   "But as the blade which springs from one and the same kind of seed, as
   suppose from wheat or any other grain, though sown in different, yea,
   or contrary soils, is yet of the same species or kind, the nature of
   the soil not changing the specifical nature of the seed that is sown in
   it, and God giving to every seed its own body, of what temper soever
   the ground is, where it is sown; in like manner, that faith which
   springs from the same seed of the gospel must needs be of one and the
   same nature and kind, though this seed be sown in the hearts of never
   so differing a constitution and frame, the temper of the heart, be it
   what it will be, not being able specifically to alter either the gospel
   or the natural fruit issuing from it. And as a blade or ear of wheat,
   though it be blasted before the harvest, is not hereby proved not to
   have been a true blade or ear of wheat before it was blasted; in like
   manner, the withering or decay of any man's faith, by what means or
   occasion soever, before his death, doth not prove it to have been a
   false, counterfeit, or hypocritical faith, or a faith of any other kind
   than that which is true, real, and permanent unto the end."

   Ans. It hath been formerly observed, that similitudes are not
   argumentative beyond the extent of that particular wherein their nature
   as such doth consist. The intendment of Christ, in this parable, is to
   manifest that many hear the word in vain, and bring forth no fruit of
   it at all. Of these, one sort is compared to stony ground, that brings
   forth a blade, but no fruit. No fruit is no fruit, though there be a
   blade or no blade. The difference between the one's receiving of seed
   and the other's, manifested by our Saviour in this parable, is in this,
   that one brings forth fruit, and the other doth not Farther; the seed
   of wheat, or the like, brings forth its fruit in a natural way, and
   therefore whatever it brings forth follows in some measure the nature
   of the seed; but the seed of the gospel brings forth its fruit in a
   moral way, and therefore may have effects of sundry natures, That which
   the seed of wheat brings forth is wheat; but that which the gospel
   brings forth is not gospel, but faith. Besides; what the wheat brings
   forth, if it come not, nor ever will, to be wheat in the ear, is but
   grass, and not of the same nature and kind with that which is wheat
   actually; though virtually and originally there be the nature of wheat
   in the root, yet actually wheat is not in the blade, that hath not, nor
   ever will have, ear. If the seed of wheat be so corrupted in the soil
   where it is sown that it cannot bring forth fruit, that which it doth
   bring forth, whatever it be, is of a different nature from that which
   is brought forth to perfection by the seed of wheat in good ground.
   Again; faith is brought forth by the seed of the gospel, when the
   promises and exhortations of the gospel, being preached unto men, do
   prevail on them to give assent unto the truth of it. That every such
   effect wrought is true, justifying faith, giving union with Jesus
   Christ, Mr Goodwin cannot prove. That effects specifically different
   may be brought forth by the same seed of the gospel, seeing "to some it
   is a savour of life unto life, and to some a savour of death unto
   death," needs not much proving. Some receive the word, and turn it into
   wantonness; some are cast into the mould of it, and are translated into
   the same image, -- if "the temper of the heart," as is said, is "not
   able specifically to alter the gospel." But that there may not fruit of
   various kinds be borne in the heart that assents to it, that receives
   it in the upper crust and skin of it, is the question. Neither is it a
   blade occasionally, withering before the harvest, but a slight
   receiving of the seed, so as that it can never bring forth fruit, that
   is intimated. In sum, this whole discourse is a great piece of
   sophistry, in comparing natural and moral causes in the producing of
   their effects; a thing not intended in the parable, and whereabout he
   that will busy himself "jungat vulpes et mulgeat hircos." This is that
   which our Saviour teacheth us in the similitude of seed sown in the
   stony ground: The word is preached unto some men, who are affected with
   it for a season, assent unto it, but not coming up to a cordial close
   with it, after a while wither away. And such as these, we say, were
   never true believers. A small matter will serve to make a man a true
   believer, if these are such. What tendency this doctrine may have to
   lull men asleep in security, when Christ is not in them of a truth, may
   easily appear and be judged. If men who are distinguished from other
   believers by such signal differences as these here are, may yet pass
   for true believers, justified, sanctified, adopted ones, "solvi[te]
   mortales curas," -- the way to heaven is laid open to thousands, who, I
   fear, will never come to the end of the journey.

   What remains of Mr Goodwin's discourse on this text is spent in
   answering some objections which are made against his interpretation of
   the place. It grows now late, and this task grows so heavy on my hand
   that I cannot satisfy myself in the repetition of any thing spoken
   before or delivered, which would necessarily enforce a particular
   consideration of what Mr Goodwin here insists on. Let him at his
   leisure answer this one argument, and I shall trouble him no farther in
   this matter:--

   That faith which hath neither root nor fruit, neither sound heart nor
   good life, that by-and-by readily and easily yields, upon temptation,
   to a total defection, is not true, saving, justifying faith. The root
   of faith, taken spiritually, is the habit of it in the heart, -- a
   spiritual, living habit; which if it reside not in the heart, all
   assent whatever wants the nature of faith, true and saving. The fruits
   of faith are, good works and new obedience. That faith which hath not
   works, James tells you, is dead. Dead and living faith, doubtless,
   differ specifically. Again, faith purifieth the heart; and when a heart
   is wholly polluted, corrupted, naught, and false, there dwells no faith
   in that heart; it is impossible it should be in a heart, and not at
   least radically and fundamentally purify it. Farther, Mr Goodwin hath
   told us that true believers are so fortified against apostasy, that
   they are in only a possibility, in no probability or great danger, of
   total apostasy; and therefore they who presently and readily fall away
   cannot be of those who are scarce in any danger of so doing, upon any
   account whatever; -- but that the faith here mentioned hath neither
   root nor fruit, good heart to dwell in nor good life attending it, but
   instantly, upon trial and temptation, vanisheth to nothing, we are
   taught in the text itself: therefore the faith here mentioned is not
   true or saving faith. That it hath "no root" is expressly affirmed,
   verse 21. And all the rest of the qualities mentioned are evidenced
   from the opposition wherein they who are these believers are set unto
   true believers. They receive the word in "honest and good hearts," they
   "bring forth fruit with patience," they "endure in time of trial," like
   the house built on the rock, when the house built on the sand falls to
   the ground.

   One word more with this witness before we part. They who receive the
   word in honest and good hearts, keep it, do bring forth fruit with
   patience, and fall not away under temptation (so saith the testimony);
   but all true believers receive the word in honest and good hearts:
   ergo; -- which is the voice of Mr Goodwin's fourth witness in this
   cause.

   Then 2 Pet. ii. 18-22 is forced to bring up the rear of the testimonies
   by Mr Goodwin produced to convince the world of the truth and
   righteousness of his doctrine of the saints' apostasy, ending his whole
   discourse in the mire. Observations from the text or context, from the
   words themselves, or the coherence, to educe his conclusion from, he
   insists not on. Many excellent words, concerning the clearness and
   evidence of this testimony, and the impossibility of avoiding what
   hence he concludes, we want not; but we have been too often inured to
   such a way of proceeding to be now moved at it or troubled about it.
   Were the waters deep, they would not make such a noise. The state and
   condition of the men here described by the apostle is so justly
   delineated to the eye by the practice of men:in the world to whom the
   gospel is preached, that I do not a little wonder how any man exercised
   in the ministry should once surmise that they are true believers of
   whom he here treats. Taking the words in the sense wherein they are
   commonly received, and in their utmost extent, who sees them not daily
   exemplified in and upon them who are yet far enough from the "faith of
   God's elect"? By the dispensation of the word, especially when managed
   by a skilful "master of assemblies," men are every day so brought under
   the power of their convictions and of the light communicated to them,
   as to acknowledge the truth and power of the word, and, in obedience
   thereunto, to leave off, avoid, and abhor, the ways and courses wherein
   the men of the world, either not hearing the word at all, or not so
   wrought upon by it, do pollute themselves and wallow in all manner of
   sensuality; and yet are not changed in their nature, so as to become
   new creatures, but continue indeed and in the sight of God "dogs and
   swine," oftentimes returning to their "vomit and mire," though some of
   them hold out in their profession to the end. And these are they whom,
   commonly, our divines have deciphered under the name of" formalists,"
   having a "form of godliness, but denying the power of it," who are here
   all at once by Mr Goodwin interested in Christ and the "inheritance of
   the saints in light." To make good his enterprise, he argues from the
   Remonstrants, sect. 40, p. 297:--

   "1. If the said expressions import nothing but what hypocrites, and
   that in sensu composito,' that is, whilst hypocrites, are capable of,
   then may those be hypocrites who are separated from men that live in
   error, and from the pollutions of the world, and that through the
   knowledge of Jesus Christ; and, on the other hand, those may be saints
   and sound believers who wallow in all manner of filthiness, and defile
   themselves daily with the pollutions of the world. This consequence,
   according to the principles and known tenets of our adversaries, is
   legitimate and true, inasmuch as they hold That true believers may fall
   so foul and so far that the church, according to Christ's institution,
   may be constrained to testify that they cannot bear them in their
   outward communion, and that they shall have no part in the kingdom of
   Christ, except they repent,' etc. But whether this be wholesome and
   sound divinity or no, to teach that they who are separate from sinners,
   and live holily and blamelessly in this present world, and this by
   means of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, may be hypocrites and children
   of perdition, and they, on the other hand, who are companions of
   thieves, murderers, adulterers, etc., saints and sound believers, I
   leave to men whose judgments are not turned upside down with prejudice
   to determine."

   Sundry things might be observed from the text to render this discourse
   altogether useless as to the end for which it is produced: as, 1. That
   sundry copies, verse 18, instead of holos [213] read oligon, -- who
   "almost," or in a little way or measure, so escaped as is said. 2. That
   it is not said that those who are so escaped may apostatize. It is
   said, indeed, that the false prophets and teachers deleazousin, do lay
   baits for them, as the fisher doth for the fish that he would take, by
   proposing unto them a liberty as to all manner of impurity and
   uncleanness; but that in so doing they prevail over them is not
   affirmed. 3. The conditional expression, verse 20, may be used in
   reference to the false prophets, and not to them that are said to
   "escape the pollutions of the world;" and if to them, that nothing can
   be argued from thence hath plentifully, upon several occasions, been
   already demonstrated. But, to suffer Mr G. to leap over all these blots
   in his entrance, and to take the words in his own sense and connection,
   I say, --

   1. In what large and improper sense such persons as we treat of are
   termed "hypocrites" hath been declared. Those who pretend to be
   God-ward, what they know themselves not to be, making a pretence of
   religion to colour and countenance themselves in vice and vicious
   practices or sensual courses, wherein they allow and bless themselves,
   we intend not; but such as in some sincerity, under the enjoyment and
   improvement of gifts and privileges, do or may walk conscientiously (as
   Paul before his conversion), and yet are not united to Christ.

   2. Of these we say that they may so "escape," etc. But that sound
   believers may "wallow in all manner of filthiness, and defile
   themselves with all manner of pollutions," we say not; nor will any
   instance given amount to the height and intendment of these
   expressions, they being all alleviated by sundry considerations
   necessary to be taken in with that of their sinning.

   3. If we may compare the worst of a saint with the best of a formal
   professor, and make an estimate of the states and conditions of them
   both, we may cast the balance on the wrong side.

   4. We do say that Simon Peter was a believer when he denied Christ, and
   Simon Magus a hypocrite and in the "bond of iniquity" when it was said
   he "believed." We do say that a man may be alive notwithstanding many
   wounds and much filth upon him, and a man may be dead without either
   the one or the other, in that eminently visible manner. He adds, --

   "2. The persons here spoken of are said to have ontos truly and really,
   escaped from them who live in error.' Doubtless a hypocrite cannot be
   said truly or really, but in show or appearance at most, to have made
   such an escape (I mean from men who live in error), considering that,
   for matter of reality and truth, remaining in hypocrisy, he lives in
   one of the greatest and foulest errors that is."

   The whole force of this second exception lies upon the ambiguity of the
   term "hypocrite." Though such as pretend religion and the worship of
   God, to be a colour and pretext for the free and uncontrolled
   practising of vile abominations, may not be said so to escape it, yet
   such as those we have before described, with their convictions, light,
   gifts, duties, good conscience, etc., may truly and really escape from
   them and their ways who pollute themselves with the errors of idolatry,
   false worship, superstition, and the pollutions of practices against
   the light of nature and their own convictions. It is added that, --

   "3. A hypocrite, whose foot is already in the snare of death, cannot
   upon any tolerable account, either of reason or common sense, be said
   to be allured' (that is, by allurements to be deceived) or overcome by
   the pollutions of the world,' no more than a fish that is already in
   the net or fast upon the hook can be said to be allured or deceived by
   a bait held to her."

   Ans. But he that hath been so far prevailed upon by the preaching of
   the word as to relinquish and renounce the practices of uncleanness,
   wherein he some time wallowed and rolled himself, may be prevailed upon
   and overcome by temptations to backslide into the same abominable
   practices wherein he was formerly engaged, deserting that way and
   course of attending to the word and yielding obedience thereunto which
   he had entertained, that in its own nature tended to a better end. Says
   he, --

   "4. Hypocrites are nowhere said, neither can they with any congruity to
   Scripture phrase be said, to have escaped the pollutions of the world
   through the acknowledgment' (for so the word epignosis should be
   translated) of Jesus Christ;' the acknowledgment of the truth, and so
   of Christ and of God, constantly in the Scriptures importing a sound
   and saving work of conversion, as we lately observed in this chapter,
   sect. 20."

   Ans. It sufficeth that the thing itself intimated is sufficiently
   revealed in the Scriptures, and confirmed by the examples of all those
   who have acknowledged the truth of the word to the putting on of a form
   of godliness, though they come not up to the power or saving practice
   of it. And truly I cannot admit that any one who hath had never so
   little experience in the work of the ministry, or made never so little
   observation of religion, should once suppose that all such persons must
   needs be accounted true believers, regenerate, etc.

   Mr Goodwin shuts up this chapter with a declaration concerning the
   uselessness of cautions and admonitions given to believers about
   backsliding, upon a supposition of an infallible promise of God for
   their perseverance. I presume the reader is weary as well as myself;
   and having in the last chapter heard him out to the full [as to] what
   he is able to say to this common-place of opposition to the doctrine we
   have thus far asserted, and offered those considerations of the ways of
   God's dealings with believers to preserve them in the course of their
   obedience and walking with him which, I hope, through the mercy and
   goodness of God, may be satisfactory to them that shall weigh them, I
   shall not burden him with the repetition of any thing already
   delivered, nor do judge it needful for to add any thing more.

   [213] Holos seems to be a misprint for ontos, which is the reading of
   the textus receptus. This latter reading is now abandoned in the
   critical editions of the New Testament. Estius seems to have adopted
   oligon; Bloomfield has no doubt that it should be oligo; Tischendorf,
   on the authority of some of the most ancient manuscripts, several
   ancient versions, and several of the Fathers, inserts oligos in the
   text as the proper reading. The meaning in this case would be "almost."
   In the translation of De Wette, "beinahe," "almost," is the word
   employed. -- Ed.

       ipsa deficeret; et permansuram, si voluntas eadem permaneret?
       Quando ergo oravit ne fides ejus deficeret, quid aliud rogavit,
       nisi ut haberet in fide liberrimam, fortissimam, invictissimam,
       perseverantissimam voluntatem?: [4343]1

       offensione, et constituere ante conspectum gloriæ suæ, immaculatos
       in lætitia,' nisi perseverantiam bonam? quis tam insulse desipiat,
       ut neget perseverantiam esse donum Dei, cum dicit sanctissimus
       Jeremias, Timorem meum dabo in corde eorum ut non recedant a me,':

       exclusa: ac si quis (inquit) præceptor discipulo soloecizanti

       virtus in infirmitate perficitur; quæ virtus, nisi Qui gloriatur,
       ut in Domino glorietur?' Ac per hoc de ipsa perseverantia boni
       noluit Deus sanctos suos in viribus suis, sed in ipso gloriari, qui
       eis non solum dat adjutorium quod primo homini dedit, sine quo non
       possit perseverare si velint, sed in iis etiam operatur et velle;
       et quoniam non perseverabunt nisi et possint, et velint,
       perseverandi eis et pessibilitas et voluntas, divinæ gratiæ
       largitate, donatur; tantum quippe Spiritu Sancto accenditur
       voluntas eorum, ut ideo possint quia sic volunt, ideo sic velint,
       quia Deus operatur ut velint. Nam si tanta infirmitate hujus vitæ
       ipsis relinquitur voluntas sua, ut in adjutorio Dei, sine quo
       perseverare non possent, manerent si vellent, ni Deus in eis
       operatur ut velint, inter tot, et tantas tentationes, infirmitate
       sua succumberet voluntas, et ideo perseverare non possent, quia
       deficientes infirmitare voluntatis non vellent, aut non ita
       vellent, ut possent. Subventum est igitur infirmitati voluntatis
       humanæ, ut divina gratia indeclinabiliter, et insuperabiliter
       ageretur, et ideo quamvis infirma non tamen deficeret.: [4436]1

       epistolis, licet saris copiosis, occasio scribendi prætermittitur,
       nec vel divinare licet, quare potissimum ad hanc vel illam
       ecclesiam literas voluerit mittere. Deinde ipsius peregrinationis
       ratio non parvum injicit scrupulum considerantibus, quod multo
       rectiore et breviori itinere, Romam potuerit navigare, ut testatur
       vel ipsius Pauli exemplum. Expende quam longum sit iter, Antiochia
       ad littus Ægæi pelagi se recipere, ibique recta sursmn versus

     * Nemo existimet bonos de ecclesia posse discedere. Triticum non
       rapit ventus, nec arborem solida radice fundatam procella

       turbinis incursione evertuntur. Hos execratur et percutit Johannes
       apostolus, dicens, Ex nobis exierunt, sed non fuerunt ex nobis, si
       enim fuissent ex nobis, mansissent utique nobiscum,': [4460]1
     * Nemo repente fit turpissimus.: [4461]1
     * Neque audax ille et importunus Ignatii censor, quicquam attulit ad

       impudentiam singularem (nec sævi magne sacerdos) dum ad suum
       Genevatismum antiquitatem detorquet invitissimam, non autem quod
       oportuit, Calvinismum amussitat ad antiquitatem.: [4462]1
     * Neque est hoc novum argumentum, sed antiquissimum. Scribit enim S.
       Prosper in Epistola ad S. Augustinum, Gallos qui sententiam ejusdem
       Augustini de predestinatione calumniabantur, illud potissimum
       objicere solitos quod ea sententia doctrinæ veterum videbatur esse
       contraria. Sed respondet idem Augustinus in Lib. de Bono
       Perseverantiæ, veteres patres, qui ante Pelagium floruerunt,
       quæstionem istam nunquam accurate tractasse sed incidenter solum,
       et quasi per transitum illam attigisse. Addit vero, in fundamento

       quod ait apostolus, "oportet hæreses esse, ut probati manifesti
       fiunt in nobis," multo vlgilantiores, diligentioresque reddidit, ut

       sed quia pro me advocatus apud Patrem Christus est, sed quia pro me

     * obstruatur, flexis genibus cordis mei imploro ecclesiam, præcipue
       Romanam, quæ summa authoritate vigere dignoscitur, quatenus ipsa
       determinare dignetur, quid circa præmissas catholice sit tenendum.
       Non enim sine periculo in talibus erratur. Simon, dormis? exurge:
       [4731]1
     * ordinare ut aliquid fiat: [4732]1
     * ordinem in factis statuere: [4733]1
     * pars magna: [4734]1
     * penitus: [4735]1 [4736]2
     * per saltum: [4737]1
     * perseverantia: [4738]1 [4739]2
     * persevero: [4740]1 [4741]2
     * pertinacia: [4742]1
     * petitio principii: [4743]1 [4744]2
     * pie vivere cernimus; sed tunc vere sunt quod appellantur, si
       manserint in eo propter quod sic appellantur. Si autem
       perseverantiam non habent, id est, in eo quod coeperunt esse non
       manent, non vere appellantur quod appellantur, et non sunt.:
       [4745]1
     * plerumque non quia fortis est, vincit quis, aut quia non potest
       vinci; sed quoniam ille qui victus est, nullis viribus fuit: adeo
       idem ille victor bene valenti postea comparatus, etiam superatus
       recedit. Non aliter hæreses de quorundam infirmitatibus habent quod
       valent, nihil valentes si in bene valentem fidem incurrant. Solent
       quidem isti infirmines etiam de quibusdam personis ab hæresi captis
       ædificari in ruinam; quare ille vel illa, fidelissimi,
       prudentissimi, et usitatissimi in ecclesia, in illam partem
       transiterunt? Quis hoc dicens non ipse sibi respondet, neque
       prudentes, neque fideles, neque usitatos æstimandos quos hæresis
       potuit demutare?: [4746]1
     * potestatem plebis circa sacra: [4747]1
     * præcognitionem: [4748]1
     * prædecerno: [4749]1
     * prædestinati: [4750]1
     * præscio: [4751]1
     * principalium urbium : [4752]1
     * principium cognoscendi: [4753]1
     * principium essendi: [4754]1
     * prodigii instar est quod notandum duxit Dav. Blondellus potestatem
       plebis circa sacra (de qua tandem integram dissertationem
       elucubravit) artificiis quibuscunque asserturus. Hic (inquit) nos
       monet Clemens fideles etiam de episeopatu aut presbyterio
       contendentes, non ab episcopi singulari : [4755]1
     * protego: [4756]1
     * quasi re preclarè gestâ: [4757]1
     * quatenus eæ : [4758]1
     * qui Christo insiti sumus, talis data est gratia, ut non solum
       poasimus si velimus, sed etiam ut velimus in Christo perseverare.:
       [4759]1
     * qui episcopo, presbyteris, et diaconis obsequuntur: [4760]1
     * quibus illecebris adducti nescio: [4761]1
     * quidem nobis incumbit necessitas, ut in tanta exemplarium et
       editionum varietate et inconstantia, nihil uspiam Ignatio
       interpolatum aut adsutum affirmemus.: [4762]1
     * quis is est tam potens: [4763]1
     * quod ille tam afflictim ardet, sed a multitudinis solius arbitrio,
       tum contendentes de episcopo, tum fideles omnes Corinthios
       pependisse æque concludendum erit.: [4764]1
     * ratio ordinis ad finem: [4765]1
     * ratione speciali, propter conditionem status humanæ naturæ, quæ
       quidem licet per gratiam sanetur, quantum ad mentem, remanet tamen
       in eo corruptio, et infectio quantum ad carnem, per quam servit
       legi peccati, ut dicitur, : [4766]1
     * removens prohibens: [4767]1
     * respondeo non usque quaque verum est, quod pro concesso sumitur,
       quamvis enim in una ecclesia aut cætu plures simul episcopi nunquam
       fuerint: [4768]1
     * revelationem: [4769]1
     * satis pro imperio: [4770]1
     * scisco: [4771]1 [4772]2
     * sect. secunda: [4773]1
     * sermone est, et non scientia, apostolicum virum ex ipso sermone
       exprimens, tam sensuum nomine quam simplicitate verborum: [4774]1
     * si serio rem ageret Dav. Blondellus de presbyteris suis (non de
       episcopis nostris) actum plane et triumphatum erit, nec enim ab
       universo aliquo presbyterorum collegio, : [4775]1
     * sic legcndum: [4776]1
     * solius: [4777]1
     * solus habeto: [4778]1 [4779]2
     * solvi[te] mortales curas: [4780]1
     * solvite curas: [4781]1
     * sponsalia: [4782]1
     * statuo: [4783]1
     * suadet tota epistolæ series: [4784]1
     * subjectum disponere ad finem: [4785]1
     * substratum: [4786]1
     * suo more: [4787]1
     * suppositis supponendis: [4788]1
     * tàm quàm: [4789]1
     * tantum non in episcopatu Puritani: [4790]1
     * teste meipso: [4791]1
     * textus receptus: [4792]1

     * unumquodque, quod est, dum est, necessario est: [4797]1
     * urbium: [4798]1
     * usque ad nauseam: [4799]1
     * ut simpliciter fateor, legi hæc omnia, et in mente mea plurima
       coacervans, accito notario vel mea, vel aliena dictavi, nec
       ordinis, nec verborum interdum nec sensuum memor: [4800]1
     * ut supra: [4801]1
     * ut vel simpliciter erraverint, vel alio sensu scripserint, vel a
       librariis imperitis eorum paulatim scripta corrupta sint; vel certe
       antequam in Alexandria, quasi dæmonium meridianum, Arius
       nasceretur, innocenter quædam, et minus caute locuti sunt, et quæ
       non possunt perversorum hominum calumniam declinare: [4802]1
     * valde: [4803]1
     * valeat quantum valere potest: [4804]1 [4805]2
     * velle: [4806]1
     * verbum de verbo: [4807]1
