Dedication

  TO THE
  RIGHT HON. AND NOBLEST
  LORD RICHARD, EARL OF CARBERY,
  ETC., ETC.

   My Lord,

   I am treating your Lordship as a Roman gentleman did St. Augustine and
   his mother: I shall entertain you in a charnel-house, and carry your
   meditations awhile into the chambers of death, where you shall find the
   rooms dressed up with melancholic arts, and fit to converse with your
   most retired thoughts, which begin with a sigh, and proceed in deep
   consideration, and end in a holy resolution. The sight that St.
   Augustine most noted in that house of sorrow, was the body of Caesar,
   clothed with all the dishonours of corruption that you can suppose in a
   six months' burial. But I know, that, without pointing, your first
   thoughts will remember the change of a greater beauty, which is now
   dressing for the brightest immortality, and from herbed of darkness
   calls to you to dress your soul for that change which shall mingle your
   bones with that beloved dust, and carry your soul to the same quire,
   where you may both sit and sing for ever. My Lord, it is your dear
   Lady's anniversary, and she deserved the biggest honour, and the
   longest memory, and the fairest monument, and the most solemn mourning:
   and in order to it, give me leave, my Lord, to cover her hearse with
   these following sheets. This book was intended first to minister to her
   piety; and she desired all good people should partake of the advantages
   which are here recorded; she knew how to live rarely well, and she
   desired to know how to die; and God taught her by an experiment. But
   since her work is done, and God supplied her with provisions of his
   own, before I could minister to her, and perfect what she desired, it
   is necessary to present to your Lordship those bundles of cypress which
   were intended to dress her closet, but come now to dress her hearse. My
   Lord, both your Lordship, and myself have lately seen and felt such
   sorrows of death, and such sad departure of dearest friends, that it is
   more than high time we should thing ourselves nearly concerned in the
   accidents. Death hath come so near to you, as to fetch a portion from
   your very heart; and now you cannot choose but dig your own grave, and
   place your coffin in your eye, when the angel hath dressed your scene
   of sorrow and mediation with so particular and so near an object: and,
   therefore, as it is my duty, I am come to minister to your pious
   thoughts, and to direct your sorrows, that they may turn into virtues
   and advantages.

   And since I know your Lordship to be so constant and regular in your
   devotions, and so tender in the matter of justice, so ready in the
   expressions of charity, and so apprehensive of religion; that you are a
   person whose work of grace is apt and must every day grow toward those
   degrees where, when you arrive, you shall triumph over imperfection,
   and choose nothing but what may please God; I could not by any
   compendium conduct and assist your pious purposes so well as by that
   which is the great argument and the great instrument of Holy Living,
   the consideration and exercises of death.

   My Lord, it is a great art to die well, and to be learnt by men in
   health, by them that can discourse and consider, by those whose
   understanding and act of reason are not abated with fear or pains; and
   as the greatest part of death is passed by the preceeding years of our
   life, so also in those years are the greatest preparations to it; and
   he that prepares not for death before his last sickness, is like him
   that begins to study philosophy when he is going to dispute publicly in
   the faculty. All that a sick and dying man can do, is but to exercise
   those virtues which he before acquired, and to perfect that repentance,
   which was begun more early. And of this, my Lord, my book, I think, is
   a good testimony; not only because it represents the vanity of a late
   and sick-bed repentance, but because it contains in it so many precepts
   and meditations, so many propositions and various duties, such forms of
   exercise, and the degrees and difficulties of so many graces, which are
   necessary preparatives to a holy death, that the very learning the
   duties requires study and skill, time and understanding, in the ways of
   godliness; and it were very vain to say so much is necessary, and not
   to suppose more time to learn them, more skill to practise them, more
   opportunities to desire them, more abilities both of body and mind,
   that can be supposed in a sick, amazed, timorous, and weak person;
   whose senses are weak, whose discerning facilities are lessened, whose
   principles are mane intricate and entangles, upon whose eye sits a
   cloud, and the heart is broken with sickness, and the liver pierced
   through with sorrows and the strokes of death. And, therefore, my Lord,
   it is intended by the necessity of affairs that the pre-health, and the
   days of discourse and understanding which, in this case hath another
   degree of necessity superadded; because in other notices, an imperfect
   study may be supplied by a frequent exercise and renewed experience;
   her, if we practise imperfectly once, we shall never recover the error,
   for we die but once; and therefore it will be necessary that our skill
   be more exact, since it is not to be mended by trial, but the actions
   must be for ever left imperfect, unless the habit be contracted with
   study and contemplation beforehand.

   And indeed I were vain if I should intend this book to be read and
   studied by dying persons; and they were vainer that should need to be
   instructed in those graces, which they are then to exercise and to
   finish. For a sick bed is only a school of severe exercise, in which
   the spirit of a man is tried and his graces are rehearsed; and the
   assistances which I have, in the following pages, given to those
   virtues, which are proper to the state of sickness, are such as suppose
   a man in the state of grace; or they confirm a good man, or they
   support the weak, or add degrees, or minister comfort, or prevent an
   evil, or cure the little mischiefs which are incident to tempted
   persons in their weakness. That is the sum of the present design, as it
   relates to dying persons. And therefore I have not inserted any advices
   proper to old age, but such as are common to it and the state of
   sickness, for I suppose very old age to be a longer sickness; it is a
   labour and sorrow when it goes beyond the common period of nature; but
   if it be on this side that period, and be healthful, in the same degree
   it is so I reckon it in the accounts of life, and therefore it can have
   no distinct consideration. But I do not think it is a station of
   advantage to begin the change of an evil life in; it is a middle state
   between life and death-bed; and, therefore, although it hath more of
   hopes than this, and less than that, yet as it partakes of either
   state, so it is to be regulated by the advices of that state, and
   judged by its sentences.

   Only this; I desire that all old persons would sadly consider that
   their advantages in that state are very few; their bodies are without
   strength, their prejudices long and mighty, their vices (if they have
   lived wicked) are habitual, the occasions of the virtues not many, the
   possibilities of some (in the matter of which they stand very guilty)
   are past, and shall never return again (such are chastity and many
   parts of self-denial;) that they have some temptations proper to their
   age, as peevishness and pride, covetousness and talking, wilfulness and
   unwillingness to learn: and they think they are protected by age from
   learning anew, or repenting the old, and do not leave but change their
   vices; and after all this, either the day of their repentance is past,
   as we see it true in very many, or it is expiring and towards the
   sunset, as it is in all; and, therefore, although in in these to
   recover is very possible, yet we may also remember that, in the matter
   of virtue and repentance, possibility is a great way off from
   performance; and how few do repent of whom it is only possible that
   they may! and that many things more are required to reduce their
   possibility to act; a great grace, an assiduous ministry, an effective
   calling, mighty assistances, excellent counsel, great industry, a
   watchful diligence, a well-disposed mind, passionate desires, deep
   apprehensions of danger, quick perceptions of duty, and time, and God's
   good blessing, and effectual impression, and seconding all this, that
   to will and do may, by him, be wrought to great purposes and with great
   speed.

   And, therefore, it will not be amiss, but it is hugely necessary, that
   these persons who have lost their time and their blessed opportunities
   should have the diligence of youth, and the zeal of new converts, and
   take account of every hour that is left them, and pray perpetually, and
   be advised prudently, and study the interest of their souls carefully,
   with diligence, and with fear; and their old age, which, in effect, is
   nothing but a continual death-bed, dressed with some more order and
   advantages, may be a state of hope, and labour, and acceptance; through
   the infinite mercies of God, in Jesus Christ.

   But concerning sinners really under the arrest of death, God hath made
   no death-bed covenant, the Scriptures hath recorded no promises, given
   no instructions; and therefore I had none to give, but only the same
   which are to be given to all men that are alive, because they are so,
   and because it is uncertain when they shall be otherwise. But then this
   advice I also am to insert, that they are the smallest number of
   Christian men who can be divided by the characters of a certain
   holiness or an open villainy; and between these there are many degrees
   of latitude, and most are of a middle sort, concerning which we are
   tied to make the judgments of charity, and possibly God may do too.
   But, however, all they are such to whom the rules of Holy Dying are
   useful and applicable, and therefore no separation is to be made in
   this world. But where the case is not evident, men are to be permitted
   to the unerring judgment of God; where it is evident we can rejoice or
   mourn for them that die.

   In the church of Rome they reckon otherwise concerning sick and dying
   Christians than I have done. For they make profession, that from death
   to life, from sin to grace, a man may very certainly be changed, though
   the operation begin not before his last hour; and half this they do
   upon his death-bed, and the other half when he is in his grave; and
   they take away the eternal punishment in an instant, by a
   school-distinction, or the hand of the priest; and the temporal
   punishment shall stick longer, even then, when the man is no more
   measured with time, having nothing to do with any thing of or under the
   sun; but that they pretend to take away too, when the man is dead; and,
   God knows, the poor man for all this pays them both in hell. The
   distinction of temporal and eternal is a just measure of pain when it
   refers to this life and another; but to dream of a punishment temporal,
   when all his time is done, and to think of repentance when the time of
   grace is past, are great errors, the one in philosophy and both in
   divinity, and are a huge folly in their pretence, and infinite danger
   if they are believed being a certain destruction of the necessity of
   holy living, when men dare trust them, and live at the rate of such
   doctrines. The secret of these is soon discovered; for by such means,
   though holy life be not necessary, yet a priest is; as if God did not
   appoint the priest to minister to holy living, but to excuse it; so
   making the holy calling not only to live upon the sins of the people,
   but upon their ruin, and the advantages of their function to spring
   from their eternal dangers. It is an evil craft to serve a temporal end
   upon the death of souls; that is an interest not to be handled but with
   nobleness and ingenuity, fear and caution, diligence and prudence, with
   great skill and great honesty, with reverence, and trembling, and
   severity; a soul is worth all that, and the need we have requires all
   that; and therefore those doctrines that go less than all this are not
   friendly, because they are not safe.

   I know no other difference in the visitation and treating of sick
   persons than what depends upon the article of late repentance; for all
   churches agree in the same essential propositions, and assist the sick
   by the same internal ministries. As for external, I mean unction, used
   in the church of Rome, since it is used when the man is above half
   dead, when he can exercise no act of understanding, it must needs be
   nothing; for no rational man can think that any ceremony can make a
   spiritual change, without a spiritual act of him that is to be changed;
   nor work by way of nature, or by charm, but morally, and after the
   manner of reasonable creatures; and therefore I do not think that
   ministry at all fit to be reckoned among the advantages of sick
   persons. The fathers of the Council of Trent first disputed, and after
   this manner at last agreed, that extreme unction was instituted by
   Christ. But afterwards, being admonished by one of their theologues,
   that the apostles ministered unction to inform people before they were
   priests, (the priestly order, according to their doctrine being
   collated in the institution of the Last Supper,) for fear that it
   should be taught that this unction might be administered by him that
   was no priest, they blotted out the word instituted, and put in its
   stead insinuated, this sacrament, and that it was published by St.
   James. So it is in their doctrine; and yet in their anathomatisms, they
   curse all them that shall deny it to have been instituted by Christ. I
   shall lay no more prejudice against it, or the weak arts of them that
   maintain it, but add this only, that there being but two places of
   Scripture pretended for this ceremony, some chief men of their own side
   have proclaimed these two invalid as to the institution of it; for
   Suarez says, that the unction used by the apostles, in St. mark, vi.13,
   is not the same with what is used in the church of Rome; and that it
   cannot be plainly gathered from the Epistle of St. James, Cajetan
   affirms, and that it did belong to the miraculous gift of healing, not
   to a sacrament. The sick man's exercise of grace formerly acquired, his
   perfecting repentance began in the days of health, the prayers and
   counsels of the holy man that ministers, the giving the holy sacrament,
   the ministry and assistance of angels, and the more mercies of God, the
   peace of conscience, and the peace of the church, are all the
   assistances and preparatives that can help to dress his lamp. But if a
   man shall go to buy oil when the bridegroom comes, if his lamp be not
   first furnished and then trimmed, that in this life, this upon his
   death-bed, his station will be without doors, his portion with
   unbelievers; and the unction of the dying man shall no more strengthen
   his soul than it cures his body; and the prayers for him after his
   death shall be of the same force, as if they should pray that he should
   return to life again the next day, and live as long as Lazarus in his
   return. But I consider that it is not well that men should pretend any
   thing will do a man good when he dies; and yet the same ministries, and
   ten times more assistances, are found for forty or fifty years together
   to be ineffectual. Can extreme unction at last cure what the holy
   sacrament of the eucharist, all his life-time, could not do? Can
   prayers for a dead man do him more good than when he was alive? If all
   his days the man belonged to death and the dominion of sin, and from
   thence could not be recovered by sermons, and counsels, and perpetual
   precepts, and frequent sacraments, by confessions and absolutions, by
   prayers and advocations, by external ministries and internal acts, it
   is but too certain that his lamp cannot then be furnished: his extreme
   unction is only then of use when it is made by the oil that burned in
   his lamp in all the days of his expectation and waiting for the coming
   of the bridegroom.

   Neither can any supply be made in this case by their practice of
   praying for the dead; though they pretend for this the fairest
   precedents of the church and of the whole world. The heathens, they
   say, did it, and the Jews did it, and the Christians did it; some were
   baptized for the dead in the days of the apostles, and very many were
   communicated for the dead for so many ages after. It is true they were
   so, and did so; the heathens prayed for any easy grave, and a perpetual
   spring, that saffron would rise from their beds of grass. The Jews
   prayed that the souls of their dead might be in the garden of Eden,
   that they might have their part in Paradise, and in the world to come;
   and that they might hear the peace of the fathers of their generation,
   sleeping in Hebron. And the Christians prayed for a joyful
   resurrection, for mercy at the day of judgment, for hastening of the
   coming of Christ, and the kingdom of God; and they named all sorts of
   persons in their prayers, all, I mean, but wicked persons, all but them
   that lived evil lives; they named apostles, saints and martyrs. And all
   this is so nothing to their purpose, or so much against it, that the
   prayers for the dead used in the church of Rome are most plainly
   condemned, because they are against the doctrine and practices of all
   the world, in other forms, to other purposes, relying upon distinct
   doctrines, until new opinions began to arise, about St. Augustine's
   time, and changed the face of the proposition. Concernment from the
   Lord; and therefore concerning it we can have no rules nor proportions,
   but from those imperfect revelations of the state of departed souls,
   and the measures of charity, which can relate only to the imperfection
   of their present condition, and the terrors of the day of judgment; but
   to think that any suppletory to an evil life can be taken from such
   devotions, after the sinners are dead, may encourage a bad man to sin,
   but cannot relieve him when he hath.

   But, of all things in the world, methinks, men should be most careful
   not to abuse dying people; not only because their condition is
   pitiable, but because they shall soon be discovered, and, in the secret
   regions of souls, there shall be an evil report concerning those men
   who have deceive them: and if we believe we shall go to that place
   where such reports are made, we may fear the shame and the amazement of
   being accounted impostors in the presence of angels, and all the wise
   holy men of the world. To be erring and innocent, is hugely pitiable,
   and incident to mortality; that we cannot help; but to deceive or to
   destroy so great an interest as is that of a soul, or to lessen its
   advantages, by giving it trifling and false confidences, is injurious
   and intolerable. And therefore it were very well if all the churches of
   the world would be extremely curious concerning their offices and
   ministries of the visitation of the sick: that their ministers they
   send be holy and prudent; that their instructions be severe and safe;
   that their sentences be merciful and reasonable, that their offices be
   sufficient and devout; that their attendances be frequent and long;
   that their deputations be special and peculiar; that the doctrines upon
   which they ground their offices be true, material and holy; that their
   ceremonies be few, and their advices wary; that their separation be
   full of caution, their judgments not remiss, their remissions not loose
   and dissolute; and that all the whole ministration be made by persons
   of experience and charity. For it is a sad thing to see our dead go out
   of our hands: they live incuriously, and die without regard; and the
   last scene of their life, which should be dressed with all spiritual
   advantages, is abused by flattery and easy propositions, and let go
   with carelessness and folly.

   My Lord, I have endeavoured to cure some part of the evil as well as I
   could, being willing to relieve the needs of indigent people in such
   ways as I can; and, therefore, have described the duties which every
   sick man may do alone, with such in which he can be assisted by the
   minister; and am the more confident that these my endeavours will be
   the better entertained because they are the first entire body of
   directions for sick and dying people that I remember to have been
   published in the church of England. In the church of Rome there have
   been many; but they are dressed with such doctrines, which are
   sometimes useless, sometimes hurtful, and their whole design of
   assistance, which they commonly yield, is at the best imperfect, and
   the representment is too careless and loose for so severe an
   employment. So that, in this affair, I was almost forced to walk alone;
   only that I drew the rules and advices from the fountains of Scripture,
   and the purest channcla of the primitive church, and was helped by some
   experience in the cure of souls. I shall measure the success of my
   labours, not by popular noises or the sentences of curious persons, but
   by the advantage which good people may receive. My work here is not to
   please the speculative part of men, but to minister, to practice, to
   preach to the weary, to comfort the sick, to assist the penitent, to
   reprove the confident, to strengthen weak hands and feeble knees,
   having scarce any other possibilities left me of doing alms, or
   exercising that charity by which we shall be judged at doomsday. It is
   enough for me to be an under-builder in the house of God, and I glory
   in the employment; I labour in the foundations; and therefore the work
   needs no apology for being plain, so it be strong and well laid. But,
   my Lord, as mean as it is, I must give God thanks for the desires and
   the strength; and, next to him, to you, for that opportunity and little
   portion of leisure which I had to do it in: for I must acknowledge it
   publicly (and, besides my prayers, it is all the recompense I can make
   you,) my being quiet I owe to your interest, much of my support to your
   bounty, and many other collateral comforts I derive from your favour
   and nobleness. My Lord, because I much honour you, and because I would
   do honour to myself, I have written your name in the entrance of my
   book: I am sure you will entertain it because the design related to
   your dear Lady, and because it may minister to your spirit in the day
   of visitation; when God shall call for you to receive your reward for
   your charity and your noble piety, by which you have not only endeared
   very many persons, but in great degrees have obliged me to be.

   My noblest Lord,

   Your Lordship's most thankful

   and most humble servant,

   Jer. Taylor.

CHAPTER I.

A GENERAL PREPARATION TOWARDS A HOLY AND BLESSED DEATH, BY WAY OF CONSIDERATION.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I.

    Consideration of the Vanity and Shortness of Mans Life.

   A man is a bubble, (said the Greek proverb,) [1] which Lucian
   represents with advantages and its proper circumstances, to this
   purpose; saying, that all the world is a storm, and men rise up in
   their several generations, like bubbles descending a Jove pluvio, from
   God and the dew of heaven, from a tear and drop of rain, from nature
   and Providence; and some of these instantly sink into the deluge of
   their first parent, and are hidden in a sheet of water, having had no
   other business in the world, but to be born, that they might be able to
   die: others float up and down two or three turns, and suddenly
   disappear, and give their place to others: and they that live longest
   upon the face of the waters are in perpetual motion, restless and
   uneasy; and, being crushed with a great drop of a cloud, sink into
   flatness and a froth; the change not being great, it being hardly
   possible it should be more a nothing that it was before. So is every
   man: he is born in vanity and sin; he comes into the world like morning
   mushrooms, soon thrusting up their heads into the air, and conversing
   with their kindred of the same production, and as soon they turn into
   dust and forgetfulness - some of them without any other interest in the
   affairs of the world, but that they made their parents a little glad
   and very sorrowful: others ride longer in the storm; it may be until
   seven years of vanity be expired, and then peradventure the sun shines
   hot upon their heads, and they fall into the shades below, into the
   cover of death and darkness of the grave to hide them. But if the
   bubble stands the shock of a bigger drop, and outlives the chances of a
   child, of a careless nurse, of drowning in a pail of water, of being
   overlaid by a sleepy servant, or such little accidents, then the young
   man dances like a bubble, empty and gay, and shines like a dove's neck,
   or the image of a rainbow, which hath no substance, and whose very
   imagery and colours are fantastical; and so he dances out the gaiety of
   his youth, and is all the while in a storm, and endures only because he
   is not knocked on the head by a drop of bigger rain, or crushed by the
   pressure of a load of indigested meat, or quenched by the disorder of
   an ill-placed humour: and to preserve a man alive in the midst of so
   many chances and hostilities is as great a miracle as to create him; to
   preserve him from rushing into nothing, and at first to draw him up
   from nothing were equally the issues of an almighty power. And
   therefore the wise men of the world have contended who shall best fit
   man's condition with words signifying his vanity and short abode.
   Honour calls a man "a leaf," the smallest, the weakest piece of a
   short-lived, unsteady plant. Pindar calls him "the dream of a shadow:"
   another "the dream of the shadow of smoke." But St. James spake by a
   more excellent spirit, saying, Our life is but a vapour,' [2] viz,
   drawn from the earth by a celestial influence; made of smoke, or the
   lighter parts of water tossed with every wind, moved by the motion of a
   superior body, without virtue in itself, lifted up on high, or left
   below, according as it pleased the sun, its foster-father. But it is
   lighter yet. It is but appearing; [3] a fantastic vapour, an
   apparition, nothing real; it is not so much as a mist, not the matter
   of a shower, nor substantial enough to make a cloud; but it is like
   Cassiopeia's chair, or Pelop's shoulder, or the circles of heaven,
   phainorena, for which you cannot have a word that can signify a vernier
   nothing. And yet the expression is one degree more made diminutive; a
   vapour, and fantastical, or a mere appearance, and this but for a
   little while neither, [4] the very dream, the phantasm, disappears in a
   small time, "like the shadow that departed; or like a tale that is
   told, or as a dream when one waketh." A man is so vain, so unfixed, so
   perishing a creature, that he cannot long last in the scene of fancy: a
   man goes off, and is forgotten, like the dream of a distracted person.
   The sum of all is this: that thou art a man, than whom there is not in
   the world any greater instance of heights and declinations, of lights
   and shadows, of misery and folly, of laughter and tears, of groans and
   death.

   And because this consideration is of great usefulness and great
   necessity to many purposes of wisdom and the spirit, all the succession
   of time, all the changes in nature, all the varieties of light and
   darkness, the thousand thousands of accidents in the world, and every
   contingency to every man and to every creature, doth preach our funeral
   sermon, and calls us to look and see how the old sexton, Time, throws
   up the earth, and digs a grave, where we must lay our sins or our
   sorrows, and sow our bodies, till they rise again in a fair or an
   intolerable eternity. Every revolution which the sun makes about the
   world divides between life and death; and death possesses both those
   portions by the next morrow; and we are dead to all those months of
   which we have already lived, and we shall never live them over again:
   and still God makes little periods of our age. [5] First we change our
   world, when we come from the womb to feel the warmth of the sun. Then
   we sleep and enter into the image of death, in which state we are
   unconcerned in all the changes of the world: and if our mothers or our
   nurses die, or a wild boar destroy our vine-yards, or our king be sick,
   we regard it not, but, during that state, are as disinterested as if
   our eyes were closed with the clay that weeps in the bowels of the
   earth. At the end of seven years our teeth fall and die before us,
   representing a formal prologue to the tragedy; and still, every seven
   years it is odds but we shall finish the last scene: and when nature,
   or chance, or vice, takes our body in pieces, weakening some parts and
   loosing others, we taste the grave and the solemnities of our own
   funerals, first, in those parts that ministered to vice; and next, in
   them that served for ornament; and, in a short time, even they that
   served for necessity become useless and entangled like the wheels of a
   broken clock. Baldness is but a dressing to our funerals, [6] the
   proper ornament of mourning, and of a person entered very far into the
   regions and possession of death; and we have many more of the same
   signification - gray hairs, rotten teeth, dim eyes, trembling joints,
   short breath, stiff limbs, wrinkled skin, short memory, decayed
   appetite. Every day's necessity calls for a reparation of that portion
   which death fed on all night, when we lay in his lap, and slept in his
   outer chambers. The very spirits of a man prey upon the daily portion
   portion of bread and flesh, and every meal is a rescue from one death,
   and lays up for another; and while we think a thought, we die; and the
   clock strikes, and reckons on our portion of eternity: we form our
   words with the breath of our nostrils - we have the less to live upon
   for every word we speak.

   Thus nature calls us to meditate of death by those things which are the
   instruments of acting it; and God, by all the variety of his
   providence, makes us see death everywhere, in all variety of
   circumstances, and dressed up for all the fancies, and the expectation
   of every single person. Nature hath given us one harvest every year,
   but death hath two; and the spring and the autumn send throngs of men
   and women to charnel-houses; and the summer long men are recovering
   from their evils of the spring, till the dog-days come, and the Sirian
   star makes the summer deadly; and the fruits of autumn are laid up for
   all the year's provision, and the man that gathers them eats and
   surfeits, and dies and needs them not, and himself is laid up for
   eternity; and he that escapes till winter only stays for another
   opportunity, which the distempers of that quarter minister to him with
   great variety. Thus death reigns in all the portions of our time. The
   autumn with its fruit provides disorders for us, and the winter's cold
   turns them into sharp diseases, and the spring brings flowers to strew
   our hearse, and the summer gives green turf and brambles to bind upon
   our graves. Calentures and surfeit, cold and agues, are the four
   quarters of the year, and all minister to death; and you can no
   whither, but you tread upon a dead man's bones.

   The wild fellow, in Petronius, that escaped upon a broken table from
   the furies of a shipwreck, as he was sunning himself upon the rocky
   shore, espied a man, rolled upon his floating bed of waves, ballasted
   with sand in the folds of his garment, and carried by his civil enemy,
   the sea, towards the shore to find a grave: and it cast him into some
   sad thoughts; [7] that peradventure this man's wife, in some part of
   the continent, safe and warm, looks next month for the good man's
   return; or it many be, his son knows nothing of the tempest; or his
   father things of that affectionate kiss, which still is warm upon the
   good man's cheek, ever since he took a kind of farewell; and he weeps
   with joy to think how blessed he shall be when his beloved boy returns
   into the circle of his father's arms. These are the thoughts of
   mortals, this is the end and sum of all their designs: a dark night and
   an ill guide, a boisterous sea and a broken cable, a hard rock and a
   rough wind, dashed in pieces the fortune of a whole family; and they
   that shall weep loudest for the accident are not yet entered into the
   storm, and yet have suffered shipwreck. Then looking upon the carcass,
   he knew it, and found it to be the master of the ship, who, the day
   before, cast up the accounts of his patrimony and his trade, and named
   the day when he thought to be at home: see how the man swims who was so
   angry two days since; his passions are becalmed with the storm, his
   accounts cast up, his cares at an end, his voyage done, and his gains
   are the strange events of death, which, whether they be good or evil,
   the men that are alive seldom trouble themselves concerning the
   interest of the dead.

   But seas alone do not break our vessel in pieces: everywhere we may be
   shipwrecked. A valiant general, when he is to reap the harvest of his
   crowns and triumphs, fights unprosperously, or falls into a fever with
   joy and wine, and changes his laurel into cypress, his triumphal
   chariot to a hearse; dying the night before he was appointed to perish
   in the drunkenness of his festival joys. It was a sad arrest of the
   loosenesses and wilder feasts of the French court, when their king
   (Henry II.) was killed really by the sportive image of a fight. And
   many brides have died under the hands of paranymphs and maidens,
   dressing them for uneasy joy, the new and undiscerned chains of
   marriage, according to the saying of Bensirah, the wise Jew, "The bride
   went into her chamber, and knew not what should befall her there." Some
   have been paying their vows, and giving thanks for a prosperous return
   to their own house, and the roof hath descended upon their heads, and
   turned their loud religion into the deeper silence of a grave. And how
   many teeming mothers have rejoiced over their swelling wombs, and
   pleased themselves in becoming the channels of blessing to a family;
   and the midwife hath quickly bound their heads and feet, and carried
   them forth to burial! Or else the birth-day of an heir hath seen the
   coffin of the father brought into the house, and the divided mother
   hath been forced to travail twice, with a painful birth and a sudden
   death. [8]

   There is no state, no accident, no circumstance of our life, but it
   hath soured by some sad instance of a dying friend; a friendly meeting
   often ends in some mischance, and makes an eternal parting; and when
   the poet Eschylus was sitting under the walls of his house, an eagle
   hovering over his bald head mistook it for a stone, and let fall his
   oyster, hoping there to break the shell, but pierced the poor man's
   skull.

   Death meets us everywhere, and is procured by every instrument, and in
   all chances and enters in at many doors; by violence and secret
   influence; by the aspect of a star and the stink of a mist; by the
   emissions of a cloud and the meeting of a vapour; by the fall of a
   chariot and the stumbling at a stone; by a full meal or an empty
   stomach; by watching at the wine or by watching at prayers; by the sun
   or the moon; by a heat or a cold; by sleepless nights or sleeping days;
   by water frozen into the hardness and sharpness of a dagger, [9] or
   water thawed into the floods of a river; by a hair or a raisin; by
   violent motion or sitting still; by severity or dissolution; by God's
   mercy or God's anger; by everything in providence and everything in
   manners; by everything in nature and everything in chance. [10]
   Eripitur persona, manetres; we take pains to heap up things useful to
   our life, and get our death in the purchase; and the person is snatched
   away, and the goods remain. And all this is the law and constitution of
   nature; it is a punishment to our sins, the unalterable event of
   Providence, and the decree of Heaven. The chains that confine us to
   this condition are strong as destiny, and immutable as the eternal laws
   of God.

   I have conversed with some men who rejoiced in the death or calamity of
   others, and accounted it as a judgment upon them for being on the other
   side, and against them in the contention; but within the revolution of
   a few months the same man met with a more uneasy and unhandsome death;
   which when I saw, I wept, and was afraid; for I knew that it must be so
   with all men; for we also shall die, [11] and end our quarrels and
   contentions by passing to a final sentence.

  SECTION II.

    The Consideration reduced to Practice.

   It will be very material to our best and noblest purposes, if we
   represent this scene of change and sorrow a little more dressed up in
   circumstances; for so we shall be more apt to practice those rules, the
   doctrine of which is consequent to this consideration. It is a mighty
   change that is made by the death of every person, and it is visible to
   us who are alive. Reckon but from the sprightfulness of youth, and the
   fair cheeks and full eyes of childhood, from the vigorousness and
   strong flexure of the joints of five-and-twenty, to the hollowness and
   dead paleness, to the loathsomeness and horror, of a three days'
   burial, and we shall perceive the distance to be very great and very
   strange. But so have I seen a rose newly springing from the clefts of
   its hood, and, at first, it was fair as the morning, and full with the
   dew of heaven, as a lamb's fleece; but when a ruder breath had forced
   open its virgin modesty, and dismantled its too youthful and unripe
   retirements, it began to put on darkness, and to decline to softness
   and the symptoms of a sickly age; it bowed the head, and broke its
   stalk; and at night, having lost some of its leaves and all its beauty,
   it fell into the portion of weeds and outworn faces. The same is the
   portion of every man and every woman; the heritage of worms and
   serpents, rottenness and cold dishonour, and our beauty so changed that
   our acquaintance quickly knew us not; and that change mingled with so
   much horror, or else meets so with our fears and weak discoursings,
   that they who, six hours ago, tended upon us, either with charitable or
   ambitious services, cannot, without some regret, stay in the room alone
   where the body lies stripped of its life and honour. I have read of a
   fair young German gentleman, who, living, often refused to be pictured,
   but put off the importunity of his friends' desire by giving way, that,
   after a few days' burial, they might send a painter to his vault, and,
   if they saw cause for it, draw the image of his death unto the life.
   They did so, and found his face half eaten, and his midriff and
   backbone full of serpents; and so he stands pictured among his armed
   ancestors. So does the fairest beauty change, [12] and it will be as
   bad with you and me; and then what servants shall we have to wait upon
   us in the grave? what friends to visit us? what officious people to
   cleanse away the moist and unwholesome cloud reflected upon our faces
   from the sides of the weeping vaults, which are the longest weepers for
   our funeral?

   This discourse will be useful, if we consider and practise the
   following rules and considerations respectively:

   1. All the rich and all the covetous men in the world will perceive,
   and all the world will perceive for them, that it is but an ill
   recompense for all their cares, that, by this time all that shall be
   left will be this, [13] that the neighbours shall say, "He died a rich
   man;" and yet his wealth will not profit him in the grave, but hugely
   swell the sad accounts of doomsday. And he that kills the Lord's people
   with unjust or ambitious wars, for an unrewarding interest, shall have
   this character; [14] that he threw away all the days of his life, that
   one year might be reckoned with his name, and computed by his reign or
   consulship: and many men, by great labours and affronts, many
   indignities and crimes, labour only for a pompous epitaph, and a loud
   title upon their marble; whilst those into whose possessions their
   heirs or kindred are entered are forgotten, and lie unregarded as their
   ashes, and without concernment or relation, as the turf upon the face
   of their grave. [15] A man may read a sermon, the best and most
   passionate that ever man preached, if he shall but enter into the
   sepulchres of kings. In the same Escurial where the Spanish princes
   live in greatness and power, and decree war or peace, they have wisely
   placed a cemetery, where their ashes and their glory shall sleep till
   time shall be no more; and where our kings have been crowned their
   ancestors lie interred, and they must walk over their grandsire's head
   to take his crown. There is an acre sown with royal seed, the copy of
   the greatest change, from rich to naked, from ceiled roofs to arched
   coffins, from living like gods to die like men. There is enough to cool
   the flames of lust, to abate the heights of pride, to appease the itch
   of covetous desires, to sully and dash out the dissembling colours of a
   lustful, artificial, and imaginary beauty. There the warlike and the
   peaceful, the fortunate and the miserable, the beloved and the despised
   princes mingle their dust, and pay down their symbol of mortality, and
   tell all the world that when we die our ashes shall be equal to kings',
   and our accounts easier, and our pains for our crowns shall be less. To
   my apprehension, it is a sad record which is left by Atheneus
   concerning Ninus, the great Assyrian monarch, whose life and death are
   summed up in these words: "Ninus, the Assyrian, had an ocean of gold,
   and other riches, more than the sand in the Caspian Sea; he never say
   the stars, and perhaps he never desired it; he never stirred up the
   holy fire among the Magi, nor touched his god with the sacred rod
   according to the laws; he never offered sacrifice, nor worshipped the
   deity, nor administered justice, nor spake to his people, nor numbered
   them; but he was most valiant to eat and drink, and having mingled his
   wines, he threw the rest upon the stores. This man is dead; behold his
   sepulchre; and now hear where Ninus is. Some time I was Ninus, and drew
   the breath of a living man; but now am nothing but clay. I have nothing
   but what I did eat, and what I served to myself in lust; that was and
   is all my portion. The wealth with which I was esteemed blessed, my
   enemies meeting together shall bear away, as the mad Thyades carry a
   new goat. I am gone to hell; and when I went thither I neither carried
   gold, nor horse, nor silver chariot. I that wore a mitre am now a
   little heap of dust." I know not anything that can better represent the
   evil condition of a wicked man, or a changing greatness. [16] From the
   greatest secular dignity to dust and ashes his nature bears him; and
   from thence to hell his sins carry him, and there he shall be for ever
   under the dominion of chains and devils, wrath and an intolerable
   calamity. This is the reward of an unsanctified condition, and a
   greatness ill-gotten or ill-administered.

   2. Let no man extend his thoughts, or let his hopes wander towards
   future and far-distant events and accidental contingencies. This day is
   mine and yours, but ye know not what shall be on the morrow and every
   morning creeps out of a dark cloud, leaving behind it an ignorance and
   silence deep as midnight, and undiscerned as are the phantasms that
   make a chrisom-child to smile; so that we cannot discern what comes
   hereafter, [17] unless we had a light from heaven brighter than the
   vision of an angel, even the spirit of prophecy. Without revelation we
   cannot tell whether we shall eat to-morrow, or whether a squinancy
   shall choke us: and it is written in the unrevealed folds of Divine
   predestination, that many who are this day alive shall to-morrow be
   laid upon the cold earth, and the women shall weep over their shroud,
   and dress them for their funeral. St. James, in his Epistle, notes the
   folly of some men, his contemporaries, who were so impatient of the
   event of to-morrow, or the accidents of next year, or the good or evils
   of old age, that they would consult astrologers and witches, oracles
   and devils, what should befall them the next calends--what should be
   the event of such a voyage--what God had written in his book concerning
   the success of battles, the election of emperors, the heirs of
   families, the price of merchandise, the return of the Tyrian fleet, the
   rate of Sidonian carpets: and as they were taught by the crafty and
   lying demons, so they would expect the issue; and oftentimes, by
   disposing their affairs in order towards such events, really did
   produce some little accidents according to their expectation; and that
   made them trust the oracles in greater things, and in all. Against this
   he opposes his counsel, that we should not search after forbidden
   records, [18] much less by uncertain significations: for whatsoever is
   disposed to happen by the order of natural causes or civil counsels,
   may be rescinded by a perculiar decree of Providence, or be prevented
   by the death of the interested persons; who, while their hopes are
   full, and their causes conjoined, and the work brought forward, and the
   sickle put into the harvest, and the first-fruits offered and ready to
   be eaten, even then, if they put forth their hand to an event that
   stands but at the door, at that door their body may be carried forth to
   burial before the expectation shall enter into fruition. When Richilda,
   the widow of Albert earl of Ebersberg, had feasted the emperor Henry
   III. and petitioned, in behalf of her nephew Welpho, for some lands
   formerly possessed by the earl her husband, just as the emperor held
   out his hand to signify his consent, the chamber-floor suddenly fell
   under them, and Richilda, falling upon the edge of a bathing-vessel,
   was bruised to death, and staid not to see her nephew sleep in those
   lands which the emperor was reaching forth to her, and placed at the
   door of restitution.

   3. As our hopes must be confined, so must our designs; [19] let us not
   project long designs, crafty plots, and diggings so deep that the
   intrigues of a design shall never be unfolded till our grandchildren
   have forgotten our virtues or our vices. The work of our soul is cut
   short, facile, sweet, and plain, and fitted to the small portions of
   our shorter life; and as we must not trouble our iniquity, so neither
   must we intricate our labour and purposes with what we shall never
   enjoy. This rule does not forbid us to plant orchards, which shall feed
   our nephews with their fruit; for by such provisions they do something
   towards an imaginary immortality, and do charity to their relatives:
   but such projects are reproved which discompose our present duty by
   long and future designs; [20] such which, by casting our labours to
   events at distance, make us less to remember our death standing at the
   door. It is fit for a man to work for his day's wages, or to contrive
   for the hire of a week, or to lay a train to make provisions for such a
   time as it is within our eye, and in our duty, and within the usual
   periods of man's life; for whatsoever is made necessary is also made
   prudent; but while we plot and busy ourselves in the toils of an
   ambitious war, or the levies of a great estate, night enters in upon
   us, and tells all the world how like fools we lived, and how deceived
   and miserably we died. Seneca tells of Senecio Cornelius, a man crafty
   in getting, and tenacious in holding, a great estate, and one who was
   as diligent in the care of his body as of his money, curious of his
   health as of his possessions, that he all day long attended upon his
   sick and dying friend; but when he went away, was quickly comforted,
   supped merrily, went to bed cheerfully, and on a sudden being surprised
   by a squinancy, scarce drew his breath until the morning, but by that
   time died, being snatched from the torrent of his fortune, and the
   swelling tide of wealth, and a likely hope bigger than the necessities
   of ten men. This accident was much noted then in Rome, because it
   happened in so great a fortune, and in the midst of wealthy designs;
   and presently it made wise men to consider how imprudent a person he is
   who disposes of ten years to come, when he is not lord of tomorrow.

   4. Though we must not look so far off, and pry abroad, yet we must be
   busy near at hand; we must, with all arts of the spirit, seize upon the
   present, [21] because it passes from us while we speak, and because in
   it all our certainty does consist. We must take our waters as out of a
   torrent and sudden shower, which will quickly cease dropping from
   above, and quickly cease running in our channels here below: this
   instant will never return again, and yet it may be, this instant will
   declare or secure the fortune of a whole eternity. The old Greeks and
   Romans taught us the prudence of this rule; but Christianity teaches us
   the religion of it. They so seized upon the present, that they would
   lose nothing of the day's pleasure. [22] "Let us eat and drink, for
   to-morrow we shall die;" that was their philosophy; and at their solemn
   feasts they would talk of death to heighten the present drinking, and
   that they might warm their veins with a fuller chalice, as knowing the
   drink that was poured upon their graves would be cold and without
   relish. "Break the beds, drink your wine, crown your heads with roses,
   and besmear your curled locks with nard; for God bids you to remember
   death:" so the epigrammatist speaks the sense of their drunken
   principles. [23] Something towards this signification is that of
   Solomon, "There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and
   drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour; for
   that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see that which shall be
   after him? [24] But although he concludes all this to be vanity, yet
   because it was the best thing that was then commonly known, that they
   should seize upon the present with a temperate use of permitted
   pleasures, I had reason to say [25] that Christianity taught us to turn
   this into religion. For he that by a present and constant holiness
   secures the present, and makes it useful to his noblest purposes, he
   turns his condition into his best advantage, by making his unavoidable
   fate become his necessary religion.

   To the purpose of this rule is that collect of Tuscan hieroglyphies
   which we have from Gabriel Simeon: "Our life is very short; beauty is a
   cozenage; money is false and fugitive; empire is adious, and hated by
   them that have it not, and uneasy to them that have; victory is always
   uncertain, and peace, most commonly, is but a fraudulent bargain; old
   age is miserable, death is the period, and is a happy one, if it be not
   sorrowed by the sins of our life: but nothing continues but the effects
   of that wisdom which employs the present time in the acts of a holy
   religion and a peaceable conscience." For they make us to live even
   beyond our funerals, embalmed in the spices and odours of a good name,
   and entombed in the grave of the holy Jesus, where we shall be dressed
   for a blessed resurrection to the state of angels and beatified
   spirits.

   5. Since we stay not here, being people but of a day's abode, and our
   age is like that of a fly and contemporary with a gourd, we must look
   somewhere else for an abiding city, a place in another country to fix
   our house in, whose walls and foundation is God, where we must find
   rest, or else be restless for ever. For whatsoever ease we can have or
   fancy here, is shortly to be changed into sadness or tediousness; [26]
   it goes away too soon, like the periods of our life, or stays too long,
   like the sorrows of a sinner; its own weariness, or a contrary
   disturbance, is its load; or it is eased by its revolution into vanity
   and forgetfulness; and where either there is sorrow, or an end of joy,
   there can be no true felicity; which, because it must be had by some
   instrument, and in some period of our duration, we must carry up our
   affections to the mansions prepared for us above, where eternity is the
   measure, felicity is the state, angels are the company, the Lamb is the
   light, and God is the portion and inheritance.

  SECTION III.

    Rules and Spiritual Arts of lengthening our Days, and to take off the
    objection of a Short Life.

   In the accounts of a man's life, we do not reckon that portion of days
   in which we are shut up in the prison of the womb; we tell our years
   from the day of our birth; and the same reason that makes our reckoning
   to stay so long, says also, that then it begins too soon. For then we
   are beholden to others to make the account for us; for we know not of a
   long time whether we be alive or no, having but some little approaches
   and symptoms of a life. To feed, and sleep, and move a little, and
   imperfectly, is the state of an unborn child: and when he is born he
   does no more for a good while; and what is it that shall make him to be
   esteemed to live the life of a man? and when shall that account begin?
   For we should be loath to have the accounts of our age taken by the
   measures of a beast; and fools and distracted persons are reckoned as
   civilly dead; they are no parts of the commonwealth, not subject to
   laws, but secured by them in charity, and kept from violence as a man
   keeps his ox; and a third part of our life is spent before we enter
   into a higher order, into the state of man.

   2. Neither must we thing that the life of a man begins when he can feed
   himself, or walk alone, when he can fight, or beget his like; for so he
   is contemporary with a camel or a cow; but he is first a man when he
   comes to a certain, steady use of reason, according to his proportion;
   and when that is, all the world of men cannot tell precisely. Some men
   are called at age at fourteen; some at one-and-twenty; some never; but
   all men late enough; for the life of a man comes upon him slowly and
   insensibly. But as, when the sun approaches towards the gates of the
   morning, he first opens a little eye of heaven, and sends away the
   spirits of darkness, and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark
   to matins, and by and by gilds the fringes of a cloud, and peeps over
   the eastern hills, thrusting out his golden horns, like those which
   decked the brows of Moses when he was forced to wear a veil because
   himself had seen the face of God; and still, while a man tells the
   story, the sun gets up higher, till he shows a fair face and a full
   light, and then he shines one whole day, under a cloud often, and
   sometimes weeping great and little showers, and sets quickly; so is a
   man's reason and his life. He first begins to perceive himself to see
   or taste, making little reflections upon his actions of sense, and can
   discourse of hies and dogs, shells and play, horses and liberty; but
   when he is strong enough to enter into arts and little institutions, he
   is at first entertained with trifles and impertinent things, not
   because he needs them, but because his understanding is no bigger, and
   little images of things are laid before him, like a cock-boat to a
   whale, only to play withal; but before a man comes to be wise, he is
   half dead with gouts and consumptions, with catarrhs and aches, with
   sore eyes and a wornout body. So that if we must not reckon the life of
   a man but by the accounts of his reason, he is long before his soul be
   dressed; and he is not to be called a man without a wise and an adorned
   soul, a soul at least furnished with what is necessary toward his
   well-being; but by that time his soul is thus furnished his body is
   decayed; and then you can hardly reckon him to be alive, when his body
   is possessed by so many degrees of death.

   3. But there is yet another arrest. At first he wants strength of body,
   and then he wants the use of reason; and when that is come, it is ten
   to one but he stops by the impediments of vice, and wants the strength
   of the spirit; and we know that body and soul and spirit are the
   constituent parts of every Christian man. And now let us consider what
   that thing is which we call years of discretion. The young man is past
   his tutors, and arrived at the bondage of a caitiff spirit; he is run
   from discipline, and is let loose to passion; the man by this time hath
   wit enough to choose his vice, to act his lust, to court his mistress,
   to talk confidently and ignorantly and perpetually, to despise his
   betters, to deny nothing to his appetite, to do things that, when he is
   indeed a man, he must for ever be ashamed of; for this is all the
   discretion that most men show in the first stage of their manhood; they
   can discern good from evil; and they prove their skill by leaving all
   that is good, and wallowing in the evils of folly and an unbridled
   appetite. And, by this time, the young man hath contracted vicious
   habits, and is a beast in manners, and therefore it will not be fitting
   to reckon the beginning of his life; he is a fool in his understanding,
   and that is a sad death; and he is dead in trespasses and sins, and
   that is a sadder; so that he hath no life but a natural, the life of a
   beast or a tree; in all other capacities he is dead; he neither hath
   the intellectual nor the spiritual life, neither the life of a man nor
   of a Christian; and this sad truth lasts too long. For old age seizes
   upon most men while they still retain the minds of boys and vicious
   youth, doing actions from principles of great folly, and a mighty
   ignorance, admiring things useless and hurtful, and filling up all the
   dimensions of their abode with businesses of empty affairs, being at
   leisure to attend no virtue; they cannot pray because they are busy,
   and because they are passionate; they cannot communicate because they
   have quarrels and intrigues of perplexed causes, complicated
   hostilities, and things of the world, and therefore they cannot attend
   to the things of God; little considering that they must find a time to
   die in; when death comes they must be at leisure for that. Such men are
   like sailors loosing from a port, and tossed immediately with a
   perpetual tempest, lasting till their cordage crack, and either they
   sink or return back again to the same place; they did not make a
   voyage, though they were long at sea. The business and impertinent
   affairs of most men steal all their time, and they are restless in a
   foolish motion: but this is not the progress of a man; he is no further
   advanced in the course of a life, though he reckon many years; [27] for
   still his soul is childish and trifling like an untaught boy.

   If the parts of this sad complaint find their remedy, we have by the
   same instruments also cured the evils and the vanity of a short life.
   Therefore,

   1. Be infinitely curious you do not set back your life in the accounts
   of God by the intermingling of criminal actions, or the contracting of
   vicious habits. There are some vices which carry a sword in their hand,
   and cut a man off before his time. There is a sword of the Lord, and
   there is a sword of a man, and there is a sword of the devil. Every
   vice of our own managing in the matter of carnality, of lust or rage,
   ambition or revenge, is a sword of Satan put into the hands of a man:
   these are the destroying angels; sin is the Apollyon, the destroyer
   that is gone out, not from the Lord, but from the tempter; and we hug
   the poison, and twist willingly with the vipers, till they bring us
   into the regions of an irrecoverable sorrow. We use to reckon persons
   as good as dead if they have lost their limbs and their teeth, and are
   confined to a hospital, and converse with none but surgeons and
   physicians, mourners and divines, those paltinctores, the dressers of
   bodies and souls to funeral; but it is worse when the soul, the
   principle of life, is employed wholly in the offices of death, and that
   man was worse than dead of whom Seneca tells, that being a rich fool,
   when he was lifted up from the baths and set into a soft couch, asked
   his slaves, As ego jam sedeo? Do I now sit? The beast was so drowned in
   sensuality and the death of his soul, that, whether he did sit or no,
   he was to believe another. Idleness and every vice are as much of death
   as a long disease is, or the expense of ten years; and she that lives
   in pleasures if dead while she liveth' (saith the apostle;) and it is
   the style of the Spirit concerning wicked persons, they are dead in
   trespasses and sins.' For as every sensual pleasure and every day of
   idleness and useless living lops off a little branch from our short
   life, so every deadly sin, and every habitual vice does quite destroy
   us; but innocence leaves us in our natural portions and perfect period;
   we lose nothing of our life if we lose nothing of our soul's health;
   and therefore, he that would live a full age must avoid a sin as he
   would decline the regions of death and the dishonours of the grave.

   2. If we would have our life lengthened, [28] let us begin betimes to
   live in the accounts of reason and sober counsels, of religion and the
   spirit, and then we shall have no reason to complain that our abode on
   earth is so short; many men find it long enough, and indeed it is so to
   all senses. But when we spend in waste what God hath given us in
   plenty, when we sacrifice our youth to folly, our manhood to lust and
   rage, our old age to covetousness and irreligion, not beginning to live
   till we are to die, designing that time to virtue which indeed is
   infirm to everything and profitable to nothing; then we make our lives
   short, and lust runs away with all the vigorous and healthful part of
   it, and pride and animosity steal the manly portion, and craftiness and
   interest possess old age; velut ex pleno et abundanti perdimus, we
   spend as if we had too much time, and knew not what to do with it: we
   fear everything, like weak and silly mortals, and desire strangely and
   greedily, as if we were immortal; we complain our life is short, and
   yet we throw away much of it, and are weary of many of its parts: we
   complain that day is long, and the night is long, and we want company,
   and seek out arts to drive the time away, and then weep because it is
   gone too soon. But so the treasure of the capitol is but a small estate
   when Caesar comes to finger it, and to pay with it all his legions; and
   the revenue of all Egypt and the eastern provinces was but a little sum
   when they were to support the luxury of Mark Antony, and feed the riot
   of Cleopatra; but a thousand crowns is a vast proportion to be spent in
   the cottage of a frugal person, or to feed a hermit. Just so is our
   life: it is too short to serve the ambition of a haughty prince, or an
   usurping rebel; too little time to purchase great wealth, to satisfy
   the pride of a vain-glorious fool, to trample upon all the enemies of
   our just or unjust interest; but for the obtaining virtue, for the
   purchase of sobriety and modesty, for the actions of religion, God gave
   us time sufficient, if we make the outgoings of the morning and
   evening,' that is, our infancy and old age, to be taken into the
   computations of a man. Which we may see in the following particulars:

   1. If our childhood, being first consecrated, by a forward baptism, be
   seconded by a holy education and a complying obedience; if our youth be
   chaste and temperate, modest and industrious, proceeding through a
   prudent and sober manhood to a religious old age, then we have lived
   our whole duration, [29] and shall never die, but be changed, in a just
   time, to the preparations of a better and an immortal life.

   2. If, besides the ordinary returns of our prayer and periodical and
   festival solemnities, and on seldom communions, we would allow to
   religion and the studies of wisdom those great shares that are trifled
   away upon vain sorrow, foolish mirth, lust, and impertinent amours, and
   balls and reveling and banquets, all that which was spent viciously,
   and all that time that lay fallow and without employment, our life
   would quickly amount to a great sum. Tostatus Abulensis was a very
   painful person, and a great clerk, and in the days of his manhood he
   wrote so many books, and they not ill ones, that the world computed a
   sheet for every day of his life; I suppose they meant after he came to
   the use of reason and the state of a man: and John Scotus died about
   the two-and-thirtieth year of his age; and yet, besides his public
   disputations, his daily lectures of divinity in public and private, the
   books that he wrote, being lately collected and printed at Lyons, do
   equal the number of volumes of any two the most voluminous fathers of
   the Latin church. Every man is not enabled to such employments, but
   every man is called and enabled to the works of a sober and a religious
   life; and there are many saints of God that can reckon as many volumes
   of religion and mountains of piety as those others did of good books.
   St. Ambrose (and I think, from his example, St. Augustine) divided
   every day into three tertias of employment: eight hours he spent in
   charity and doing assistance to others, dispatching their business,
   reconciling their enmities, reproving their vices, correcting their
   errors, instructing their ignorances, transacting the affairs of his
   diocese; and the other eight hours he spent in study and prayer. If we
   were thus minute and curious in the spending of our time, it is
   impossible but our life would seem very long. For so have I seen an
   amorous person tell the minutes of his absence from his fancied joy,
   and while he told the sands of his hour-glass, or the throbs and little
   beatings of his watch, by dividing an hour into so many members, he
   spun out its length by number, and so translated a day into the
   tediousness of a month. And if we tell our days by canonical hours of
   prayer, our weeks by a constant revolution of fasting-days or days of
   special devotion, and over all these draw a black cypress, a veil of
   penitential sorrow and severe mortification, we shall soon answer the
   calumny and objection of a short life. He that governs the day and
   divides the hours hastens from the eyes and observation of a merry
   sinner; but loves to stand still, and behold, and tell the sighs, and
   number the groans and sadly-delicious accents of a grieved penitent. It
   is a vast work that any man may do if he never be idle: and it is a
   huge way that a man may go in virtue if he never goes out of his way by
   a vicious habit or a great crime: and he that perpetually reads good
   books, if his parts be answerable, will have a huge stock of knowledge.
   It is so in all things else. Strive not to forget your time, and suffer
   none of it to pass undiscerned; and then measure your life, and tell me
   how you find the measure of its abode. However, the time we live is
   worth the money we pay for it; and therefore it is not to be thrown
   away.

   3. When vicious men are dying, and scared with the affrighting truths
   of an evil conscience, they would give all the world for a year, for a
   month: nay, we read of some that called out with amazement, inducias
   usque ad mane - truce but till the morning: and if that year or some
   few months were given, those men think they could do miracles in it.
   And let us awhile suppose what Dives would have done if he had been
   loosed from the pains of hell, and permitted to live on earth one year.
   Would all the pleasures of the world have kept him one hour from the
   temple? would he not perpetually have been under the hands of priests,
   or at the feet of the doctors, or by Moses' chair, or attending as near
   the altar as he could get, or reviving poor Lazarus, or praying to God,
   and crucifying all sin? I have read of a melancholy person, who saw
   hell but in a dream or a vision, and the amazement was such, that he
   would have chosen ten times to die rather than feel again so much of
   that horror: and such a person cannot be fancied but that he would
   spend a year in such holiness that the religion of a few months would
   equal the devotion of many years, even of a good man. Let us but
   compute the proportions. If we should spend all our years of reason so
   as such a person would spend that one, can it be thought that life
   would be short and trifling in which he had performed such a religion,
   served God with so much holiness, mortified sin with so great a labour,
   purchased virtue at such a rate and so rare an industry? It must needs
   be that such a man must die when he ought to die, and be like ripe and
   pleasant fruit falling from a fair tree, and gathered into baskets for
   the planter's use. He that hath done all his business, and is begotten
   to a glorious hope by the seed of an immortal spirit, can never die too
   soon, nor live too long!

   Xerxes wept sadly when he say his army of 1,300,000 men, because he
   considered that within a hundred years all the youth of that army
   should be dust and ashes; and yet, as Seneca well observes of him, he
   was the man that should bring them to their graves; and he consumed all
   that army in two years for whom he feared and wept the death after a
   hundred. Just so we do all. We complain that within thirty or forty
   years, a little more, or a great deal less, we shall descend again into
   the bowels of our mother, and that our life is too short for any great
   employment; and yet we throw away five and thirty years of our forty,
   and the remaining five we divide between art and nature, civility and
   customs, necessity and convenience, prudent counsels and religion; but
   the portion of the last is little and contemptible, and yet that little
   is all that we can prudently account of our lives. We bring that fate
   and that death near us of whose approach we are so sadly apprehensive.

   4. In taking the accounts of your life, do not reckon by great
   distances, and by the periods of pleasure, or the satisfaction of your
   hopes, or the sating your desires; but let every intermedial day and
   hour pass with observation. He that reckons he hath lived but so many
   harvests, thinks they come not often enough, and that they go away too
   soon; [30] some lose the day with longing for the night, and the night
   in waiting for the day. Hope and fantastic expectations spend much of
   our lives; and while with passion we look for a coronation, or the
   death of an enemy, or a day of joy, passing from fancy to possession
   without any intermedial notices, we throw away a precious year, and use
   it but as the burden of our time, fit to be pared off and thrown away,
   that we may come at those little pleasures which first steal our
   hearts, and then steal our life.

   5. A strict course of piety is the way to prolong our lives in the
   natural sense, and to add good portions to the number of our years; and
   sin is sometimes by natural casualty, very often by the anger of God
   and the Divine judgment, a cause of sudden and untimely death.
   Concerning which I shall add nothing (to what I have somewhere else
   said of this article, [31] ) but only the observation of Epiphanius;
   that for three thousand three hundred and thirty-two years, even to the
   twentieth age, there was not one example of a son that died before his
   father; but the course of nature was kept, that he who was first born
   in the descending line did first die, (I speak of natural death, and
   therefore Abel cannot be opposed to this observation,) till that Terah,
   the father of Abraham, taught the people a new religion, to make images
   of clay and worship them; and concerning him it was first remarked,
   that Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity:'
   God, by an unheard of judgment and a rare accident punishing his
   newly-invented crime by the untimely death of his son.

   6. But if I shall describe a living man, a man that hath that life that
   distinguishes him from a fool or a bird, that which gives him a
   capacity next to angels, we shall find that even a good man lives not
   long, because it is long before he is born to this life, and longer yet
   before he hath a man's growth. "He that can look upon death, and see
   its face with the same countenance with which he hears its story; [32]
   that can endure all the labours of his life with his soul supporting
   his body; that can equally despise riches when he hath them and when he
   hath them not; that is not sadder if they lie in his neighbour's
   trunks, nor more brag if they shine round about his own walls: he that
   is neither moved with good fortune coming to him nor going from him;
   that can look upon another man's lands evenly and pleasedly, as if they
   were his own, and yet look upon his own, and use them too, just as if
   they were another man's; that neither spends his goods prodigally and
   life a fool, nor yet keeps them avariciously and like a wretch; that
   weighs not benefits by weight and number, but by the mind and
   circumstances of him that gives them; that never thinks his charity
   expensive if a worthy person be the receiver; he that does nothing for
   opinion sake, but everything for conscience, being as curious of his
   thoughts as of his actings in markets and theatres, and is as much in
   awe of himself as a whole assembly: he that knows God looks on, and
   contrives his secret affairs as in the presence of God and his holy
   angels; that eats and drinks because he needs it, not that he may serve
   a lust or load his belly; he that is bountiful and cheerful to his
   friends, and charitable and apt to forgive his enemies; that loves his
   country, and obeys his prince, and desires and endeavours nothing more
   than that he may do honour to God:" this person may reckon his life to
   be the life of a man, and compute his months, not by the course of the
   sun, but the zodiac and circle of his virtues; because these are such
   things which fools and children, and birds and beasts, cannot have;
   these are therefore the actions of life, because they are the seeds of
   immortality. That day in which we have done some excellent thing we may
   as truly reckon to be added to our life as were the fifteen years to
   the days of Hezekiah.

  SECTION IV.

    Considerations of the miseries of Mans Life.

   As our life is very short, so it is very miserable; and therefore it is
   well it is short. God, in pity to mankind, lest his burden should be
   insupportable, and his nature an intolerable load, hath reduced our
   state of misery to an abbreviator; and the greater our misery is, the
   less while it is like to last: the sorrows of a man's spirit being like
   ponderous weights, which by the greatness of their burden make a
   swifter motion, and descend into the grave to rest and ease our wearied
   limbs; for then only we shall sleep quietly, when those fetters are
   knocked off, which not only bound our souls in prison, but also ate the
   flesh, till the very bones opened the secret garments of their
   cartilages, discovering their nakedness and sorrow.

   1. Here is no place to sit down in, but you must rise as soon as you
   are set, for we have gnats in our chambers, and worms in our gardens,
   [33] and spiders and flies in the palaces of the greatest kings. How
   few men in the world are prosperous! What an infinite number of slaves
   and beggars, of persecuted and oppressed people, fill all corners of
   the earth and groans, and heaven itself with weeping, prayers, and sad
   remembrances! How many provinces and kingdoms are afflicted by a
   violent war, or made desolate by popular diseases! Some whole countries
   are remarked with fatal evils or periodical sicknesses. Grand Cairo, in
   Egypt, feels the plague every three years returning like a quartan
   ague, and destroying many thousands of persons. All the inhabitants of
   Arabia, the desert, are in a continual fear of being buried in huge
   heaps of sand, and therefore dwell in tents and ambulatory houses, or
   retire to unfruitful mountains, to prolong an uneasy and wilder life.
   And all the countries round about the Adriatic Sea feel such violent
   convulsions by tempests and intolerable earthquakes, that sometimes
   whole cities find a tomb, and every man sinks with his own house made
   ready to become his monument, and his bed is crushed into the disorders
   of a grave. Was not all the world drowned at one deluge and breach of
   the divine agner? And shall not all the world again be destroyed by
   fire? Are there not many thousands that die every night, and that groan
   and weep sadly every day? But what shall we think of the great evil
   which for the sins of men God hath suffered to posses the greatest part
   of mankind? Most of the men that are now alive, or that have been
   living for many ages, are Jews, heathens, or Turks; and God was pleased
   to suffer a base epileptic person, a villain and a vicious, to set up a
   religion which hath filled all the nearer parts of Asia, and much of
   Africa, and some part of Europe; so that the greatest number of men and
   women born in so many kingdoms and provinces are infallibly made
   Mahometan, strangers and enemies to Christ, by whom alone we can be
   saved. This consideration is extremely sad, when we remember how
   universal and how great an evil it is, that so many millions of sons
   and daughters are born to enter into the possession of devils to
   eternal ages. These evils are the miseries of great parts of mankind,
   and we cannot easily consider more particularly the evils which happen
   to us, being the inseparable affections or incidents to the whole
   nature of man.

   2. We find that all the women in the world are either born for
   barrenness or the pains of childbirth, and yet this is one of our
   greatest blessings; but such indeed are the blessings of this world, we
   cannot be well with nor without many things. Perfumes make our heads
   ache, roses prick our fingers, and in our very blood, where our life
   dwells, is the scene under which nature acts many sharp fevers and
   heavy sicknesses. It were too sad if I should tell how many persons are
   afflicted with evil spirits, with spectres and illusions of the night;
   and that huge multitudes of men and women live upon man's flesh, nay,
   worse yet, upon the sins of men, upon the sins of their sons and of
   their daughters, and they pay their souls down for the bread they eat,
   buying this day's meal with the price of the last night's sin.

   3. Or if you please in charity to visit a hospital, which is indeed a
   map of the whole world, there you shall see the effects of Adam's sin,
   and the ruins of human nature; bodies laid up in heaps, like the bones
   of a destroyed town, homines precarit spiritus et male haerentis -- men
   whose souls seem to be borrowed, and are kept there by art and the
   force of medicine -- whose miseries are so great, that few people have
   charity or humanity enough to visit them, fewer have the heart to dress
   them, and we pity them in civility or with a transient prayer, but we
   do not feel their sorrows by the mercies of a religious pity; and,
   therefore, as we leave their sorrows in many degrees unrelieved and
   uneased, so we contract by our unmercifulness a guilt by which
   ourselves become liable to the same calamities. Those many that need
   pity, and those infinities of people that refuse to pity, are miserable
   upon a several charge, but yet they almost make up all mankind.

   4. All wicked men are in love with that which entangles them in huge
   varieties of troubles; they are slaves to the worst of masters, to sin
   and to the devil, to a passion and to an imperious woman. Good men are
   for ever persecuted, and God chastises every son whom he receives; and
   whatsoever is easy is trifling and worth nothing; and whatsoever is
   excellent is not to be obtained without labour and sorrow; and the
   conditions and states of men that are free from great cares are such as
   have in them nothing rich and orderly, and those that have are stuck
   full of thorns and trouble. Kings are full of care, and learned men in
   all ages have been observed to be very poor, [34] honestas miserias
   accusant - they complain of their honest miseries.

   5. But these evils are notorious and confessed; even they also whose
   felicity men stare at and admire, besides their splendour and the
   sharpness of their light, will, with their appendant sorrows, wring a
   tear from the most resolved eye; for not only the winter is full of
   storms and cold and darkness, but the beauteous spring hath blasts and
   sharp frosts; the fruitful teeming summer is melted with heat, and
   burnt with the kisses of the sun, her friend, and choked with dust; and
   the rich autumn is full of sickness; and we are weary of that which we
   enjoy, because sorrow is its biggest portion; and when we remember,
   that upon the fairest face is placed one of the worst sinks of the
   body, the nose, we may use it not only as a mortification to the pride
   of beauty, but as an allay to the fairest outside of condition which
   any of the sons and daughters of Adam do posses. For look upon kings
   and conquerors: I will not tell that many of them fall into the
   condition of servants, [35] and their subjects rule over them, and
   stand upon the ruins of their families, and that to such persons the
   sorrow is bigger than usually happens in smaller fortunes; but let us
   suppose them still conquerors, and see what a goodly purchase they get
   by all their bounds of the river Rhine: I speak in the style of the
   Roman greatness; for now-adays the biggest fortune swells not beyond
   the limits of a petty province or two, and a hill confines the progress
   of their prosperity, or a river checks it: but whatsoever tempts the
   pride and vanity of ambitious persons is not so big as the smallest
   star which we see scattered in disorder and unregarded upon the
   pavement and floor of heaven. And if we would suppose the pismires had
   but our understandings, they also would have the method of a man's
   greatness, and divide their little mole-hills into provinces and
   exharchates; and if they also grew as vicious and as miserable, one of
   their princes would lead an army out, and kill his neighbour ants, that
   he might reign over the next handful of a turf. But then, if we
   consider at what price and with what felicity all this is purchased,
   the sting of the painted snake will quickly appear, and the fairest of
   their fortunes will properly enter into this account of human
   infelicities.

   We may guess at it by the constitution of Augustus's fortune, who
   struggled for his power, first, with the Roman citizens, then with
   Brutus and Cassius, and all the fortune of the republic; then with his
   colleague, Mary Antony; then with his kindred and nearest relatives;
   and, after he was wearied with slaughter of the Romans, before he could
   sit down and rest in his imperial chair, he was forced to carry armies
   into Macedonia, Galatia, beyond Euphrates, Rhine, and Danubius; and
   when he dwelt at home in greatness, and within the circles of a mighty
   power, he hardly escaped the sword of the Egnatii, of Lepidus, Caepio,
   and Muraena: and after he had entirely reduced the felicity and
   grandeur into his own family, his daughter, his only child, conspired
   with many of the young nobility, and, being joined with adulterous
   complications, as with an impious sacrament, [36] they affrighted and
   destroyed the fortune of the old man, and wrought him more sorrow than
   all the troubles that were hatched in the baths and beds of Egypt
   between Antony and Cleopatra. [37] This was the greatest fortune that
   the world had then or ever since, and therefore we cannot expect it to
   be better in a less prosperity.

   6. The prosperity of this world is so infinitely soured with the
   overflowing of evils, that he is counted the most happy that hath the
   fewest; all conditions being evil and miserable, they are only
   distinguished by the number of calamities. The collector of the Roman
   and foreign examples, when he had reckoned two-and-twenty instances of
   great fortunes, every one of which had been allayed with great variety
   of evils; in all his reading or experience, he could tell but of two
   who had been famed for an entire prosperity. Quintus Metellus, and
   Gyges the king Lydia: and yet concerning the one of them he tells, that
   his felicity was so considerable (and yet it was the bigger of the two)
   that the oracle said that Aglaus the Sophidius, the poor Arcadian
   shepherd, was more happy than he-that is, he had fewer troubles; for so
   indeed we are to reckon the pleasures of this life; the limit of our
   joy is the absence of some degree of sorrow, and he that hath the least
   of this is the most prosperous person. But then we must look for
   prosperity, not in palaces or courts of princes, not in the tents of
   conquerors, or in the gaieties of fortunate and prevailing sinners; but
   rather in the cottages of honest, innocent, and contented persons,
   whose mind is no bigger than their fortune, nor their virtue less than
   their security. As for others, whose fortune looks bigger, and allures
   fools to follow it, like the wandering fires of the night, till they
   run into rivers, or are broken upon rocks with staring and running
   after them, they are all in the condition of Marius, than whose
   condition nothing was more constant, and nothing more mutable: if we
   reckon them amongst the miserable, they are the most miserable. [38]
   For just as is a man's condition, great or little, so is the state of
   his misery: all have their share; but kings and princes, great generals
   and consuls, rich men and mighty, as they have the biggest business and
   the biggest charge, and are answerable to God for the greatest
   accounts, so they have the biggest trouble, that the uneasiness of
   their appendage may divide the good and evil of the world, making the
   poor man's fortune as eligible as the greatest; and also restraining
   the vanity of man's spirit, which a great fortune is apt to swell from
   a vapour to a bubble; but God in mercy hath mingles wormwood with their
   wine, and so restrained the drunkenness and follies of prosperity.

   7. Man never hath one day to himself of entire peace from the things of
   the world, but either something troubles him, or nothing satisfies him,
   or his very fulness swells him and makes him breathe short upon his
   bed. Men's joys are troublesome; and besides that the fear of losing
   them takes away the present pleasure, (and a man hath need of another
   felicity to preserve this,) they are also wavering and full of
   trepidation, not only from their inconstant nature, but from their weak
   foundation: they arise from vanity, and they dwell upon ice, and they
   converse with the wind, and they have the wings of a bird, and are
   serious but as the resolutions of a child, commenced by chance, and
   managed by folly, and proceeded by inadvertency, and end in vanity and
   forgetfulness. So that, as Livius Drusus said of himself, he never had
   any play-days or days of quiet when he was a boy; [39] for he was
   troublesome and busy, a restless and unquiet man - the same may every
   man observe to be true of himself; he is always restless and uneasy, he
   dwells upon the waters, and leans upon thorns, and lays his head upon a
   sharp stone.

  SECTION V.

    The Consideration reduced to Practice.

   1. The effect of this consideration is this, that the sadnesses of this
   life help to sweeten the bitter cup of death. For let our life be never
   so long, if our strength were great as that of oxen and camels, if our
   sinews were strong as the cordage at the foot of an oak, if we were as
   fighting and prosperous people as Siccius Dentatus, who was on the
   prevailing side in a hundred and twenty battles, who had three hundred
   and twelve public rewards assigned him by his generals and princes for
   his valour and conduct in sieges and sharp in nine triumphs; yet still
   the period shall be that all this shall end in death, and the people
   shall talk of us awhile, good or bad, according as we deserve, or as
   they please; and once it shall come to pass that concerning every one
   of us it shall be told in the neighbourhood that we are dead. This we
   are apt to think a sad story, but therefore let us help it with a
   sadder; for we therefore need not be much troubled that we shall die,
   because we are not here in ease, nor do we dwell in a fair condition;
   but our days are full of sorrow and anguish, dishonoured and made
   unhappy with many sins, with a frail and a foolish spirit, entangled
   with difficult cases of conscience, ensnared with passions, amazed with
   fears, full of cares, divided with curiosities and contradictory
   interests, made airy and impertinent with vanities, abused with
   ignorance and prodigious errors, made ridiculour with a thousand
   weaknesses, worn away with labours, loaden with diseases, daily vexed
   with dangers and temptations, and in love with misery: we are weakened
   with delights, afflicted with want, with the evils of myself and of all
   my family, and with the sadnesses of all my friends, and of all good
   men, even of the whole church; and therefore methinks we need not be
   troubled that God is pleased to put an end to all these troubles, and
   to let them sit down in a natural period, which, if we please, may be
   to us the beginning of a better life. When the Prince of Persia wept
   because his army should all die in the revolution of an age, Artabanus
   told him that they should all meet with evils so many and so great that
   every man of them should wish himself dead long before that. Indeed it
   were a sad thing to be cut of the stone, and we that are in health
   tremble to think of it; but the man that is wearied with the disease
   looks upon that sharpness as upon his cure and remedy; and as none need
   to have a tooth drawn, so none could well endure it but he that felt
   the pain of it in his head: so is our life so full of evils, that
   therefore death is no evil to them that have felt the smart of this, or
   hope for the joys of a better.

   2. But as it helps to ease a certain sorrow, as a fire draws out fire,
   and a nail drives forth a nail, so it instructs us in a present duty,
   that is, that we should not be so fond of a perpetual storm, nor dote
   upon the transient guads and gilded thorns of this world. They are not
   worth a passion, nor worth a sigh or a groan, not of the price of one
   night's watching; and therefore they are mistaken and miserable persons
   who, since Adam planted thorns round about paradise, are more in love
   with the hedge than with the fruits of the garden, sottish admirers of
   things that hurt them, of sweet poisons, gilded daggers, and silken
   halters. Tell them they have lost a bounteous friend, a rich purchase,
   a fair farm, a wealthy donative, and you dissolve their patience; it is
   an evil bigger than their spirit can bear; it brings sickness and
   death; they can neither eat nor sleep with such a sorrow. But if you
   represent to them the evils of a vicious habit, and the dangers of a
   state of sin, if you tell them they have displeased God, and
   interrupted their hopes of heaven, it may be they will be so civil as
   to hear it patiently, and to treat you kindly, and first to commend,
   and then forget your story, because they prefer this world with all its
   sorrows before the pure unmingled felicities of heaven. But it is
   strange that any man should be so passionately in love with the thorns
   which grow on his own ground that he should wear them for armlets, and
   knit them in his shirt, and prefer them before a kingdom and
   immortality. No man loves this world the better for his being poor; but
   men that love it because they have great possessions, love it because
   it is troublesome and chargeable, full of noise and temptation, because
   it is unsafe and ungoverned, flattered and abused; and he that
   considers the troubles of an over-long garment and of a crammed
   stomach, a trailing gown and a loaden table, may justly understand that
   all that for which men are so passionate is their hurt and their
   objection - that which a temperate man would avoid and a wise man
   cannot love.

   He that is no fool, but can consider wisely, if he be in love with this
   world, we need not despair but that a witty man might reconcile him
   with tortures, and make him think charitably of the rack, and be
   brought to dwell with vipers and dragons, and entertain his guests with
   the shrieks of mandrakes, cats, and screech-owls, with the fling of
   iron, and the harshness of rending of silk, or to admire the harmony
   that is made by a herd of evening wolves, when they miss their draught
   of blood in their midnight revels. The groans of a man in a fit of the
   stone are worse than these, and the distractions of a troubled
   conscience are worse than those groans; and yet a careless merry sinner
   is worse than all that. But if we could from one of the battlements of
   heaven espy how many men and women at this time lie fainting and dying
   for want of bread, how many young men are hewn down by the sword of
   war, how many poor orphans are now weeping over the graves of their
   father, by whose life they were enabled to eat; if we could but hear
   how many mariners and passengers are at this present in a storm, and
   shriek out because their keel dashes against a rock, or bulges under
   them; how many people there are that weep with want, and are mad with
   oppression, or are desperate by too quick a sense of a constant
   infelicity; in all reason we should be glad to be out of the noise and
   participation of so many evils. This is a place of sorrows and tears,
   of great evils and a constant calamity; let us remove from hence, at
   least in affections and preparation of mind.

CHAPTER II.

A GENERAL PREPARATION TOWARDS A HOLY AND BLESSED DEATH, BY WAY OF EXERCISE.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I.

  Three Precepts preparatory to a Holy Death, to be practised in our whole Life.

   1. He that would die well must always look for death, every day
   knocking at the gates of the grave; and then the gates of the grave
   shall never prevail upon him to do him mischief. [40] This was the
   advice of all the wise and good men of the world, who, especially in
   the days and periods of their joy and festival egressions, chose to
   throw some ashes into their chalices, some sober remembrances of their
   fatal period. [41] Such was the black shirt of Saladine; the tombstone
   presented to the Emperor of Constantinople on his coronation-day; the
   Bishop of Rome's two reeds with flax and a fax-taper; the Egyptian
   skeleton served up at feasts; and Trimalcion's banquet in Petronius, in
   which was brought in the image of a dead man's bones of silver, with
   spondyles exactly returning to every of the guests, [42] and saying to
   every one, that you and you must die, and look not one upon another,
   for every one is equally concerned in this sad representment. These in
   fantastic semblances declare a severe counsel and useful meditation;
   and it is not easy for a man to be gay in his imagination, or to be
   drunk with joy or wine, pride or revenge, who considers sadly, that he
   must, ere long, dwell in a house of darkness and dishonour, and his
   body must be the inheritance of worms, and his soul must be what he
   pleases, even as a man makes it here by his living good or bad. I have
   read of a young hermit, who, being passionately in love with a young
   lady, could not, by all the arts of religion and mortification,
   suppress the trouble of that fancy, till at last, being told that she
   was dead, and had been buried about fourteen days, he went secretly to
   her vault, and, with the skirt of his mantle, wiped the moisture from
   the carcass, and still at the return of his temptation laid it before
   him, saying, Behold this is the beauty of the woman thou didst so much
   desire: and so the man found his cure. And if we make death as present
   to us, our own death, dwelling and dressed in all its pomp of fancy and
   proper circumstances - if anything will quench the heats of lust, or
   the desires of money, or the greedy passionate affections of this
   world, this must do it. But withal, the frequent use of this
   meditation, by curing our present inordinations, will make death safe
   and friendly, and by its very custom will make, that the king of
   terrors shall come to us without his affrighting dresses; and that we
   shall sit down in the grave as we compose ourselves to sleep and do the
   duties of nature and choice. The old people that lived near the
   Riphaean mountains [43] were taught to converse with death, and to
   handle it on all sides, and to discourse of it as of a thing that will
   certainly come, and ought so to do. Thence their minds and resolutions
   became capable of death, and they thought it a dishonourable thing with
   greediness to keep a life that must go from us, to lay aside its
   thorns, and to return again circled with a glory and a diadem.

   2. "He that would die well must, all the days of his life, lay up
   against the day of death," [44] not only by the general provisions of
   holiness and a pious life indefinitely, but provisions proper to the
   necessities of that great day of expense, in which a man is to throw
   his last cast for an eternity of joys or sorrows, ever remembering,
   that this alone well performed is not enough to pass us into paradise,
   but that alone, done foolishly, is enough to send us to hell, and the
   want of either a holy life or death makes a man to fall short of the
   mighty price of our high calling. In order to this rule we are to
   consider what special graces we shall then need to exercise, and by the
   proper arts of the spirit, by a heap of proportioned arguments, by
   prayers and a great treasure of devotion laid up in heaven, provide
   beforehand a reserve of strength and mercy. [45] Men in the course of
   their lives walk lazily and incuriously, as if they had both their feet
   in one shoe; and when they are passably revolved to the time of their
   dissolution, they have no mercies in store, no patience, no faith, no
   charity to God or despite of the world, being without gust or appetite
   for the land of their inheritance, which Christ with so much pain and
   blood had purchased for them. When we come to die indeed, we shall be
   very much put to it to stand firm upon the two feet of a Christian,
   faith and patience. When we ourselves are to use the articles, to turn
   our former discourses into present practice, and to feel what we never
   felt before, we shall find it to be quite another thing to be willing
   presently to quit this life and all our present possessions for the
   hopes of a thing which we were never suffered to see, and such a thing
   of which we may fail so many ways, and of which, if we fail any, we are
   miserable for ever. Then we shall find how much we have need to have
   secured the Spirit of God and the grace of faith, by an habitual,
   perfect, unmovable resolution. The same also is the case of patience,
   which will be assaulted with sharp pains, disturbed fancies, great
   fears, want of a present mind, natural weaknesses, frauds of the devil,
   and a thousand accidents and imperfections. It concerns us therefore
   highly, in the whole course of our lives, not only to accustom
   ourselves to a patient suffering of injuries and affronts, of
   persecutions and loses, of cross accidents and unnecessary
   circumstances; but also by representing death as present to us, to
   consider with what arguments then to fortify our patience, and by
   assiduous and fervent prayer to God all our life long to call upon him
   to give us patience, and great assistances, a strong faith, and a
   confirmed hope, the Spirit of God and his holy angels assistants at
   that time, to resist and to subdue the devil's temptations and
   assaults; and so to fortify our heart, that it break not into
   intolerable sorrows and impatience, and end in wretchedness and
   infidelity. But this is to be the work of our life, and not to be done
   at once; but, as God gives us time, by succession, by parts and little
   periods. For it is very remarkable, that God who giveth plenteously to
   all creatures, he hath scattered the firmament with stars, as a man
   sows corn in his fields, in a multitude bigger than the capacities of
   human order; he hath made so much variety of creatures, and gives us
   great choice of meats and drinks, although any one of both kinds would
   have served our needs, and so in all instances of nature; yet in the
   distribution of our time God seems to be straighthanded, and gives it
   to us, not as nature gives us rivers, enough to drown us, but drop by
   drop, minute after minute, so that we never can have two minutes
   together, but he takes away one when he gives us another. This should
   teach us to value our time, since God so values it. and, by his so
   small distribution of it, tells us it is the most precious thing we
   have. Since, therefore, in the day of our death we can have still but
   the same little portion of this precious time, let us in every minute
   of our life, I mean in every discernible portion, lay up such a stock
   of reason and good works, that they may convey a value to the imperfect
   and shorter actions of our death-bed, while God rewards the piety of
   our lives by his gracious acceptation and benediction upon the actions
   preparatory to our death-bed.

   3. He that desires to die well and happily, above all things, must be
   careful that he do not live a soft, a delicate, and voluptuous life;
   but a life severe, holy, and under the discipline of the cross, under
   the conduct of prudence and observation, a life of warfare and sober
   counsels, labour and watchfulness. No man wants cause of tears and a
   daily sorrow. Let every man consider what he feels, and acknowledge his
   misery; let him confess his sin, and chastise it; let him bear his
   cross patiently, and his persecutions nobly, and his repentances
   willingly and constantly; let him pity the evils of all the world, and
   bear his share of the calamities of his brother; let him long and sigh
   for the joys of heaven; let him tremble and fear, because he hath
   deserved the pains of hell; let him commute his eternal fear with a
   temporal suffering, preventing God's judgment by passing one of his
   own; let him groan for the labours of his pilgrimage and the dangers of
   his warfare; and by that time he hath summed up all these labours and
   duties and contingencies, all the proper causes, instruments, and acts
   of sorrow, he will find that for a secular joy and wantonness of spirit
   there are not left many void spaces of his life. It was St. James's
   advice, [46] "Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be
   turned into mourning, and your joy into weeping;" and Bonaventure, in
   the life of Christ, reports that the holy virgin-mother said to St.
   Elizabeth, that grace does not descend into the soul of a man but by
   prayer and affliction. [47] Certain it is, that a mourning spirit and
   an afflicted body are great instruments of reconciling God to a sinner,
   and they always dwell at the gates of atonement and restitution. But
   besides this, a delicate and prosperous life is hugely contrary to the
   hopes of a blessed eternity. Woe be to them that are at ease in Sion,'
   [48] so it was said of old; and our blessed Lord said, Woe be to you
   that laugh, for ye shall weep;' [49] Here or hereafter we must have our
   portion of sorrows. He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth
   forth good seed with him, shall doubtless come again with joy, and
   bring his sheaves with him.' [50] And certainly he that sadly considers
   the portion of Dives, and remembers that the account which Abraham gave
   him for the unavoidableness of his torment was, because he had his good
   things in this life, must, in all reason, with trembling run from a
   course of banquets and faring deliciously every day, as being a
   dangerous estate, and a consignation to an evil greater than all
   danger, the pains and torments of unhappy souls. If, either by patience
   or repentance, by compassion or persecution, by choice or by
   conformity, by severity or discipline, we allay the festival follies of
   a soft life, and profess under the cross of Christ, we shall more
   willingly and more safely enter into our grave; but the death-bed of a
   voluptuous man upbraids his little and cozening prosperities, and
   exacts pains made sharper by the passing from soft beds and a sober
   mind. He that would die holily and happily, must in this world love
   tears, humility, solitude, and repentance.

  SECTION II.

    Of daily Examination of our Actions in the whole course of our Health,
    preparatory to our Deathbed.

   He that will die well and happily must dress his soul by a diligent and
   frequent scrutiny; he must perfectly understand and watch the state of
   his soul; he must set his house in order, before he be fit to die. And
   for this there is great reason and great necessity.

   Reasons for a Daily Examination.

   1. For if we consider the disorders of every day, the multitude of
   impertinent words, the great portions of time spent in vanity, the
   daily omissions of duty, the coldness of our prayers, the indifference
   of our spirit in holy things, the uncertainty of our secret purposes,
   our infinite deceptions and hypocrisies, sometimes not known, very
   often not observed by ourselves, our want of charity, our not knowing
   in how many degrees of action and purpose every virtue is to be
   exercised, the secret adherences of pride, and too forward complacency
   in our best actions, our failings in all our relations, the niceties of
   difference between some virtues and some vices, the secret,
   indiscernible passages from lawful to unlawful in the first instances
   of change, the perpetual mistakings of permissions for duty, and
   licentious practices for permissions, our daily abusing the liberty
   that God gives us, our unsuspected sins in the managing a course of
   life certainly lawful, our little greedinesses in eating, our surprises
   in the proportions of our drinking, our too great freedoms and
   fondnesses in lawful loves, our aptness for things sensual, and our
   deadness and tediousness of spirit in spiritual employments; besides
   infinite variety of cases of conscience that do occur in the life of
   every man, and in all intercourses of every life, and that the
   productions of sin are numerous and increasing, like the families of
   the northern people, or the genealogies of the first patriarchs of the
   world; from all this we shall find that the computations of a man's
   life are busy as the tables of sines and tangents, and intricate as the
   accounts of eastern merchants; and therefore it were but reason we
   should sum up our accounts at the foot of every page, I mean that we
   call ourselves to scrutiny every night, when we compose ourselves to
   the little images of death.

   2. For if we make but one general account, and never reckon till we
   die, either we shall only reckon by great sums, and remember nothing
   but clamorous and crying sins, and never consider concerning
   particulars, or forget very many; or if we could consider all that we
   ought, we must needs be confounded with the multitude and variety. But
   if we observe all the little passages of our life, and reduce into the
   order of accounts and accusations, we shall find them multiply so fast,
   that it will not only appear to be an ease to the accounts of our
   death-bed, but by the instrument of shame will restrain the inundation
   of evils; it being a thing intolerable to human modesty to see sins
   increase so fast, and virtues grow up so slow; to see every day stained
   with the spots of leprosy, or sprinkled with the marks of a lesser
   evil.

   3. It is not intended we should take accounts of our lives only to be
   thought religious, but that we may see our evil and amend it, that we
   dash our sins against the stones, that we may go to God, and to a
   spiritual guide, and search for remedies, and apply them. And indeed no
   man can well observe his own growth in grace, but by accounting
   seldomer returns of sin, and a more frequent victory over temptations;
   concerning which every man makes his inquires and search after himself.
   In order to this it was that St. Paul wrote, before receiving the holy
   sacrament, Let a man examine himself and so let him eat.' This precept
   was given in those days when they communicated every day; and therefore
   a daily examination also was intended.

   4. And it will appear highly fitting, if we remember that, at the day
   of judgment, not only the greatest lines of life, but every branch and
   circumstance of every action, every word and thought, shall be called
   to scrutiny and severe judgment; insomuch that it was a great truth
   which one said, Woe be to the most innocent life, if God should search
   into it without mixtures of mercy. And therefore we are here to follow
   St. Paul's advice, Judge yourselves, and you shall not be judged of the
   Lord.' The way to prevent God's anger is to be angry with ourselves;
   and by examining our actions, and condemning the criminal, by being
   assessors in God's tribunal, at least we shall obtain the favour of the
   court. As therefore every night we must make our bed the memorial of
   our grave, so let our evening thoughts be an image of the day of
   judgment.

   5. This advice was so reasonable and proper an instrument of virtue,
   that it was taught even to the scholars of Pythagoras by their master;
   [51] Let not sleep seize upon the regions of your senses before you
   have three times recalled the conversation and accidents of the day."
   Examine what you have committed against the Divine law, what you have
   ommitted of your duty, and in what you have made use of the divine
   grace to the purposes of virtue and religion; joining the judge,
   reason, to the legislative mind or conscience, that God may reign there
   as a lawgiver and a judge. Then Christ's kingdom is set up in our
   hearts: then we always live in the eye of our Judge, and live by the
   measures of reason, religion, and sober counsels.

   The benefits we shall receive by practising this advice, in order to a
   blessed death, will also add to the account of reason and fair
   inducements.

   The Benefits of this Exercise.

   1. By a daily examination of our actions we shall the easier cure a
   great sin, and prevent its arrival to become habitual. For to examine
   we suppose to be a relative duty, and instrumental to something else.
   We examine ourselves, that we may find out our failings and cure them;
   and therefore if we use our remedy when the wound is fresh and
   bleeding, we shall find the cure more certain and less painful. For so
   a taper, when its crown of flame is newly blown off, retains a nature
   so symbolical to light, that it will with greediness rekindle bolical
   to light, that it will with greediness rekindle and snatch a ray from
   the neighbour fire. So is the soul of man when it is newly fallen into
   sin; although God be angry with it, and the state of God's favour and
   its own graciousness is interrupted, yet the habit is not naturally
   changed; and still God leaves some roots of virtue standing, and the
   man is modest or apt to be made ashamed, and he is not grown a bold
   sinner; but if he sleeps on it, and returns again to the same sin, and
   by degrees grows in love with it, and gets the custom, and the
   strangeness of it is taken away, then it is his master, and is swelled
   into a heap, and is abetted by use, and corroborated by
   newly-entertained principles, and is insinuated into his nature, and
   hath possessed his affections, and tainted the will and the
   understanding; and by this time a man is in the state of a decaying
   merchant, his accounts are so great and so intricate, and so much in
   arrear, that to examine it will be but to represent the particulars of
   his calamity; therefore they think it better to pull the napkin before
   their eyes than to state upon the circumstances of their death.

   2. A daily or frequent examination of the parts of our life will
   interrupt the proceeding and hinder the journey of little sins into a
   heap. For many days do not pass the best person in which they have not
   many idle words or vainer thoughts to sully the fair whiteness of their
   souls; some indiscreet passions of trifling purposes, some impertinent
   discontents or unhandsome useages of their dearest relatives. And
   though God is not extreme to mark what is done amiss, and therefore
   puts these upon the accounts of his mercy, and the title of the cross;
   yet in two cases these little sins combine and cluster; and we know
   that grapes were once in so great a bunch, that one cluster was the
   load of two men; that is, 1. When either we are in love with small
   sins; or, 2. When they proceed from a careless and incurious spirit
   into frequency and continuance. For so the smallest atoms that dance in
   all the little cells of the world are so trifling and immaterial, that
   they cannot trouble an eye, nor vex the tenderest part of a wound where
   a barbed arrow dwelt; yet when, by their infinite numbers, (as Melissa
   and Parmenides affirm,) they danced first into order, then into little
   bodies, at last they made the matter of the world; so are the little
   indiscretions of our life; they are always inconsiderable if they be
   not despised, and God does not regard them if we do. We may easily keep
   them asunder by our daily or nightly thoughts and prayers and severe
   sentences; but even the least sand can check the tumultuous pride, and
   become a limit to the sea, when it is in a heap and in united
   multitudes; but if the wind scatter and divide them, the little drops
   and the vainer froth of the water begin to invade the strand. Our sighs
   can scatter such little offences; but then be sure to breathe such
   accents frequently, lest they knot and combine, and grow big as the
   shore, and we perish in sand, in trifling instances. He that despiseth
   little things, shall perish by little and little:' so said the son of
   Sirach. [52]

   3. A frequent examination of our actions will intenerate and soften our
   consciences, so that they shall be impatient of any rudeness or heavier
   load; and he that is used to shrink, when he is pressed with a branch
   of twining osier, [53] will not willingly stand in the ruins of a house
   when the beam dashes upon the pavement. And provided that our nice and
   tender spirit be not vexed into scruple, nor the scruple turn into
   unreasonable fears, nor the fears into superstition; he that, by any
   arts, can make his spirit tender and apt for religious impressions,
   hath made the fairest seat for religion, and the unaptest and uneasiest
   entertainment for sin and eternal death, in the whole world.

   4. A frequent examination of the smallest parts of our lives is the
   best instrument to make our repentance particular, and a fit remedy to
   all the members of the whole body of sin. For our examination, put off
   to our death-bed, of necessity brings us into this condition, that very
   many thousands of our sins must be (or not be at all) washed off with a
   general repentance, which the more general and indefinite it is, it is
   ever so much the worse. And if he that repents the longest and the
   oftenest, and upon the most instances, is still, during his whole life,
   but an imperfect penitent, and there are very many reserves left to be
   wiped off by God's mercies, and to be eased by collateral assistances,
   or to be groaned for at the terrible day of judgment; it will be but a
   sad story to consider that the sins of a whole life, or of very great
   portions of it, shall be put upon the remedy of one examination, and
   the advices of one discourse, and the activities of a decayed body, and
   a weak and an amazed spirit. Let us do the best we can, we shall find
   that the mere sins of ignorance and unavoidable forgetfulness will be
   enough to be entrusted to such a bank; and if that a general repentance
   will serve towards their expiation, it will be an infinite mercy; but
   we have nothing to warrant our confidence, if we shall think it to be
   enough on our death-bed to confess the notorious actions of our lives,
   and to say, "The Lord be merciful unto me for the infinite
   transgressions of my life, which I have wilfully or carelessly forgot;"
   for very many of which the repentance, the distinct, particular,
   circumstantiate repentance of a whole life have been too little if we
   could have done more.

   5. After the enumeration of these advantages, I shall not need to add,
   that if we decline or refuse to call ourselves frequently to account,
   and to use daily advices concerning the state of our souls, it is a
   very ill sign that our souls are not right with God, or that they do
   not dwell in religion. But this I shall say, that they who do use this
   exercise frequently will make their conscience much at ease, by casting
   out a daily load of humour and surfeit, the matter of diseases and the
   instruments of death. "He that does not frequently search his
   conscience, is a house without a window," and like a wild untutored son
   of a fond and undiscerning widow.

   But if this exercise seem too great a trouble, and that by such advices
   religion will seem a burden, I have two things to oppose against it:

   1. One is, that we had better bear the burden of the Lord than the
   burden of a base and polluted conscience. Religion cannot be so great a
   trouble as a guilty soul; and whatsoever trouble can be fancied in this
   or any other action of religion, it is only to inexperienced persons.
   It may be a trouble at first, just as is every change and every new
   accident; but if you do it frequently, and accustom your spirit to it,
   as the custom will make it easy, [54] so the advantages will make it
   delectable; that will make it facile as nature, these will make it as
   pleasant and eligible as reward.

   2. The other thing I have to say is this, that to examine our lives
   will be no trouble, if we do not intricate it with the businesses of
   the world and the labyrinths of care and impertinent affairs. [55] A
   man needs a quiet and disentangled life who comes to search into all
   his actions, and to make judgment concerning his errors and his needs,
   his remedies and his hopes. They that have great intrigues of the world
   have a yoke upon their necks and cannot look back; and he that covets
   many things greedily, and snatches at high things ambitiously, that
   despises his neighbour proudly, and bears this crosses peevishly, or
   his prosperity impotently and passionately; he that is prodigal of his
   precious time, and is tenacious and retentive of evil purposes, is not
   a man disposed to this exercise; he hath reason to be afraid of his own
   memory, and to dash his glass in pieces, because it must needs
   represent to his own eyes an intolerable deformity. He therefore that
   resolves to live well, whatsoever it costs him; he that will go to
   heaven at any rate, shall best tend this duty by neglecting the affairs
   of the world in all things where prudently he may. But of our death-bed
   and the examination made by a disturbed understanding will be very
   empty of comfort and full of inconveniences.

   6. For hence it comes that men die so timorously and uncomfortably, as
   if they were forced out of their lives by the violence of an
   executioner. Then, without much examination, they remember how wickedly
   they have lived, without religion, against the laws of the covenant of
   grace, without God in the world; then they see sin goes off like an
   amazed, wounded, affrighted person from a lost battle, without honour,
   without a veil, with nothing but shame and sad remembrances; then they
   can consider, that if they had lived virtuously all the trouble and
   objection of that would now be past, and all that had remained should
   be peace and joy, and all that good which dwells within the house of
   God and eternal life. But now they find they have done amiss and dealt
   wickedly, they have no bank of good works, but a huge treasure of
   wrath, and they are going to a strange place, and what shall be their
   lot is uncertain: (so they say, when they would comfort and flatter
   themselves:) but in truth of religion their portion is sad and
   intolerable, without hope and without refreshment, and they must use
   little silly arts to make them go off from their stage of sins with
   some handsome circumstances of opinion: they will in civility be
   abused, that they may die quietly, and go decently to their execution,
   and leave their friends indifferently contented, and apt to be
   comforted; and by that time they are gone awhile they see that they
   deceived themselves all their days, and were by others deceived at
   last.

   Let us make it our own case: we shall come to that state and period of
   condition in which we shall be infinitely comforted if we have lived
   well; or else be amazed and go off trembling, because we are guilty of
   heaps of unrepented and unforsaken sins. It may happen, we shall not
   then understand it so, because most men of late ages have been abused
   with false principles, and they are taught (or they are willing to
   believe) that a little thing is enough to save them, and that heaven is
   so cheap a purchase that it will fall upon them whether they will or
   no. The misery of it is, they will not suffer themselves to be confuted
   till it be too late to recant their error. In the interim, they are
   impatient to be examined, as a leper is of a comb, and are greedy of
   the world, as children of raw fruit; and they hate a severe reproof as
   they do thorns in their bed; and they love to lay aside religion as a
   drunken person does to forget his sorrow; and all the way they dream of
   fine things and their dreams prove contrary, and become the
   hieroglyphics of an eternal sorrow. The daughter of Polycrates dreamed
   that her father was lifted up, and that Jupiter washed him, and the sun
   annointed him; but it proved to him but a sad prosperity; for after a
   long life of constant prosperous success he was surprised by his
   enemies, and hanged up till the dew of heaven wet his cheeks, and the
   sun melted his grease. Such is the condition of those persons who,
   living either in the despite or in the neglect of religion, lie
   wallowing in the drunkenness of prosperity or worldly cares; they think
   themselves to be exalted, till the evil day overtakes them; and then
   they can expound their dream of life to end in a sad and hopeless
   death. I remember that Cleomenes was called a god by the Egyptians,
   because when he was hanged a serpent grew out of his body, and wrapped
   itself about his head, till the philosophers of Egypt said it was
   natural that from the marrow of some bodies such productions should
   arise. And indeed it represents the condition of some men, who being
   dead are esteemed saints and beatified persons, when their head is
   encircled with dragons and is entered into the possession of devils,
   that old serpent and deceiver. For indeed their life was secretly so
   corrupted, that such serpents fed upon the ruins of the spirit, and the
   decays of grace and reason. To be cozened in making judgments
   concerning our final condition is extremely easy; but if we be cozened
   we are infinitely miserable.

  SECTION III.

    Of exercising Charity during our whole Life.

   He that would die well and happily must in his lifetime, according to
   all his capacities, exercise charity; [56] and because religion is the
   life of the soul, and charity is the life of religion, the same which
   gives life to the better part of man, which never dies, may obtain of
   God a mercy to the inferior part of man in the day of its dissolution.

   1. Charity is the great channel through which God passes all his mercy
   upon mankind. For we receive absolution of our sins in proportion to
   our forgiving our brother. This is the rule of our hopes, and the
   measure of our desire in this world; and in the day of death and
   judgment the great sentence upon mankind shall to transacted according
   to our alms, which is the other part of charity. Certain it is, that
   God cannot, will not, never did, reject a charitable man in his
   greatest needs and in his most passionate prayers; [57] for God himself
   is love, and every degree of charity that dwells in us is the
   participation of the divine nature; and therefore, when upon our
   death-bed a cloud covers our head, and we are enwrapped with sorrow;
   when we feel the weight of a sickness, and do not feel the refreshing
   visitations of God's loving-kindness; when we have many things to
   trouble us, and looking round about us we see no comforter; then call
   to mind what injuries you have forgiven, how apt you were to pardon all
   affronts and real persecutions, how you embraced peace when it was
   offered you, how you followed after peace when it ran from you; and
   when you are weary of one side, turn upon the other, and remember the
   alms that, by the grace of God and his assistances, you have done, and
   look up to God, and with the eye of faith behold him coming in the
   cloud, and pronouncing the sentence of doom's day according to his
   mercies and they charity.

   2. Charity with his twin-daughters, alms and forgiveness, is especially
   effectual for the procuring God's mercies in the day and manner of our
   death. Alms deliver from death,' said old Tobias; [58] and alms make an
   atonement for sins, [59] and the son of Sirach: [60] and so said
   Daniel, and so say all the wise men of the world. And in this sense,
   also, is that of St. Peter, Love covers a multitude of sins; and St.
   Clement in his Constitutions gives this counsel, "If you have anything
   in your hands, give it, that it may work to the remission of thy sins;
   for by faith and alms sins are purged. The same also is the counsel of
   Salvian, who wonders that men, who are guilty of great and many sins,
   will not work out their pardon by alms and mercy. But this also must be
   added out of the words of Lactanius, who makes this rule complete and
   useful; "But think not, because sins are taken away by alms, that by
   thy money thou mayest purchase a license to sin; for sins are abolished
   if because thou hast sinned thou givest to God," that is, to God's poor
   servants, and his indigent necessitous creatures; but if thou sinnest
   upon confidence of giving, thy sins are not abolished. For God desires
   infinitely that men should be purged from their sins, and therefore
   commands us to repent; but to repent is nothing else but to profess and
   affirm (that is, to purpose, and to make good that purpose) that they
   will sin no more. [61]

   Now alms are therefore effective to the abolition and pardon of our
   sins, because they are preparatory to, and impetratory of, the grace of
   repentance, and are fruits of repentance; and therefore St. Chrysostom
   affirms, that repentance without alms is dead, and without wings, and
   can never soar upwards to the element of love. But because they are a
   part of repentance, and hugely pleasing to Almighty God, therefore they
   deliver us from the evils of an unhappy and accursed death; for so
   Christ delivered his disciples from the sea when he appeased the storm,
   though they still sailed in the channel: and this St. Jerome verifies
   with all his reading and experience, saying, "I do not remember to have
   read that ever any charitable person died an evil death." And although
   a long experience hath observed God's mercies to descend upon
   charitable people, like the dew upon Gideon's fleece, when all the
   world was dry; yet for this also we have a promise, which is not only
   an argument of a certain number of years (as experience is,) but a
   security for eternal ages. Make ye friends of the mammon of
   unrighteousness, that when ye fail they may receive you into
   everlasting habitations. When faith fails, and chastity is useless, and
   temperance shall be no more, then charity shall bear you upon wings of
   cherubim to the eternal mountain of the Lord. "I have been a lover of
   mankind, and a friend, and merciful' and now I expect to communicate in
   that great kindness which he shows that is the great God and Father of
   men and mercies," said Cyrus the Persian on his death-bed.

   I do not mean this should only be a death-bed charity, any more than a
   death-bed repentance; but it ought to be the charity of our life and
   healthful years, a parting with portions of our goods then, when we can
   keep them: we must not first kindle our lights when we are to descend
   into our houses of darkness, or bring a glaring torch suddenly to a
   dark room that will amaze the eye, and not delight it or instruct the
   body; but if our tapers have, in their constant course, descended into
   their grave, crowned all the way with light, then let the death-bed
   charity be doubled, and the light burn brightest when it is to deck our
   hearse. But concerning this I shall afterwards give account.

  SECTION IV.

    General Considerations to enforce the former Practices.

   These are the general instruments of preparation in order to a holy
   death: it will concern us all to use them diligently and speedily; for
   we must be long in doing that which must be done but once: and
   therefore we must begin betimes, and lose no time; especially since it
   is so great a venture, and upon it depends so great a stake. Seneca
   said well, "There is no science or art in the world so hard as to live
   and die well: the professors of other arts are vulgar and many;" but he
   that knows how to do this business is certainly instructed to eternity.
   But then let me remember this, that a wise person will also put most
   upon the greatest interest. Common prudence will teach us this. No man
   will hire a general to cut wood, or shake hay with a sceptre, or spend
   his soul and all his faculties upon the purchase of a cockleshell; but
   he will fit instruments to the dignity and exigence of the design: and,
   therefore, since heaven is so glorious a state, and so certainly
   designed for us if we please, let us spend all that we have, all our
   passions and affections, all our study and industry, all our desires
   and stratagems, all our witty and ingenious faculties, towards the
   arriving thither; whither if we do come, every minute will infinitely
   pay for all the troubles of our whole life; if we do not, we shall have
   the reward of fools, an unpitied and an upbraided misery.

   To this purpose I shall represent the state of dying and dead men in
   the devout words of some of the fathers of the church, whose sense I
   shall exactly keep, but change their order; that by placing some of
   their dispersed meditations into a chain or sequel of discourse, I may
   with their precious stones make a union, and compose them into a jewel;
   for though the meditation is plain and easy, yet it is affectionate and
   material, and true and necessary.

   The Circumstances of a Dying Man's Sorrow and Danger.

   When the sentence of death is decreed and begins to be put in
   execution, it is sorrow enough to see or feel respectively the sad
   accents of the agony and last contentions of the soul, and the
   reluctances and unwillingnesses of the body: the forehead washed with a
   new and stranger baptism, besmeared with a cold sweat, tenacious and
   clammy, apt to make it cleave to the roof of his coffin; the nose cold
   and undiscerning, not pleased with perfumes, nor suffering violence
   with a cloud of unwholesome smoke; the eyes dim as a sullied mirror, or
   the face of heaven when God shows his anger in a prodigious storm; the
   feet cold, the hands stiff, the physicians despairing, our friends
   weeping, the rooms dressed with darkness and sorrow, and the exterior
   parts betraying what are the violences which the soul and spirit
   suffer; the nobler part, like the lord of the house, being assaulted by
   exterior rudenesses, and driven from all the outworks, at last, faint
   and weary with short and frequent breathings, interrupted with the
   longer accents of sighs, without moisture but the excrescences of a
   split humour- when the pitcher is broken at the cistern, it retires to
   its last fort, the heart, whither it is pursued, and stormed, and
   beaten out, as when the barbarous Thracian sacked the glory of the
   Grecian empire. Then calamity is great, and sorrow rules in all the
   capacities of man; then the mourners weep, because it is civil, or
   because they need thee, or because they fear: but who suffers for thee
   with a compassion sharp as is thy pain? Then the noise is like the
   faint echo of a distant valley, and few hear, and they will not regard
   thee, who seemest like a person void of understanding and of a
   departing interest. Vere tremendum est mortis sacramentum. But these
   accidents are common to all that die; and when a special Providence
   shall distinguish them, they shall die with easy circumstances; but as
   no piety can secure it, so must no confidence expect it, but wait for
   the time, and accept the manner of the dissolution. But that which
   distinguishes them is this:

   He that hath lives a wicked life, if his conscience be alarmed, and
   that he does not die like a wolf or a tiger, without sense or remorse
   of all his wildness and his injury, his beastly nature and desert and
   untilled manners - if he have but sense of what he is going to suffer,
   or what he may expect to be his portion - then we may expect to be his
   portion - then we may imagine the terror of their abused fancies, how
   they see affrighting shapes, and, because they fear them, they feel the
   gripes of devils, urging the unwilling souls from the kinder and fast
   embraces of the body, calling to the grave and hastening to judgment,
   exhibiting great bills of uncancelled crimes, awaking and amazing the
   conscience, breaking all their hope in pieces, and making faith useless
   and terrible, because the malice was great, and the charity was none at
   all. Then they look for some to have pity on them, but there is no man.
   [62] No man dares be their pledge: no man can redeem their soul, which
   now feels what it never feared. Then the tremblings and the sorrow, the
   memory of the past sin, and the fear of future pains, and the sense of
   an angry God, and the presence of some devils, consign him to the
   eternal company of all the damned and accursed spirits. [63] Then they
   want an angel for their guide, and the Holy Spirit for their comforter,
   and a good conscience for their testimony, and Christ for their
   advocate; and they die and are left in prisons of earth or air, in
   secret and undiscerned regions, to weep and tremble, and infinitely to
   fear the coming of the day of Christ; at which time they shall be
   brought froth to change their condition into a worse, where they shall
   for ever feel more than we can believe and understand.

   But when a good man dies, one that hath lived innocently, or made joy
   in heaven at his timely and effective repentance, and in whose behalf
   the holy Jesus hath interceded prosperously, and for whose interest the
   Spirit makes interpellations with groans and sighs unutterable, and in
   whose defence the angels drive away the devils on his death-bed,
   because his sins are pardoned, and because he resisted the devil in his
   life-time, and fought successfully, and persevered unto the end; then
   the joys break forth through the clouds of sickness, and the conscience
   stands upright, and confesses the glories of God, and owns so much
   integrity, that it can hope for pardon, and obtain it too; then the
   sorrows of the sickness, and the flames of the fever, or the faintness
   of the consumption, do but untie the soul from its chain, and let it go
   forth, first into liberty, and then to glory; for it is but for a
   little while that the face of the sky was black, like the preparations
   of the night, but quickly the cloud was torn and rent, the violence of
   thunder parted it into little portions, that the sun might look forth
   with a watery eye, and then shine without a tear. But it is an infinite
   refreshment to remember all the comforts of his prayers, the frequent
   victory over his temptations, the mortification of his lust, the
   noblest sacrifice to God in which he most delights, that we have given
   him our wills and killed our appetites for the interests of his
   services; then all the trouble of that is gone; and what remains is a
   portion in the inheritance of Jesus, of which he now talks no more as a
   thing at distance, but is entering into the possession. When the veil
   is rent, and the prison-doors are open at the presence of God's angel,
   the soul goes forth full of hope, sometimes with evidence, but always
   with certainty in the thing, and instantly it passes into the throngs
   of spirits, where angels meet it singing, and the devils flock with
   malicious and vile purposes, desiring to lead it away with them into
   their houses of sorrow: there they see things which they never saw, and
   hear voices which they never heard. There the devils charge them with
   many sins, and the angels remember that themselves rejoiced when they
   were repented of. Then the devils aggravate and describe all the
   circumstances of the sin, and add calumnies; and the angels bear the
   sword forward still, because their Lord doth answer for them. Then the
   devils rage and gnash their teeth; they see the soul chaste and pure,
   and they are ashamed; they see it penitent, and they despair; they
   perceive that the tongue was refrained and sanctified, and then hold
   their peace. Then the soul passes forth and rejoices, passing by the
   devils in scorn and triumph, being securely carried into the bosom of
   the Lord, where they shall rest till their crowns are finished, and
   their mansions are prepared; and then they shall feast and sing,
   rejoice and worship, for ever and ever. Fearful and formidable to
   unholy persons is the first meeting with spirits in their separation.
   But the victory which holy souls receive by the mercies of Jesus
   Christ, and the conduct of angels, is a joy that we must not understand
   till we feel it; and yet such which by an early and a persevering piety
   we may secure; but let us inquire after it no further, because it is
   secret

CHAPTER III.

OF THE STATE OF SICKNESS AND THE TEMPTATIONS INCIDENT TO IT, WITH THEIR PROPER
REMEDIES.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I.

    Of the State of Sickness.

   Adam's sin brought death into the world, and man did die the same day
   in which he sinned, according as God had threatened. He did not die as
   death is taken for a separation of soul and body; that is not death
   properly, but the ending of the last act of death; just as a man is
   said to be borne in his mother's womb; but whereas to man was intended
   a life long and happy, without sickness, sorrow, or infelicity, and
   this life should be lived here or in a better place, and the passage
   from one to the other should have been easy, safe, and pleasant, now
   that man sinned he fell from that state to a contrary.

   If Adam had stood, he should not always have lived in this world; for
   this world was not a place capable of giving a dwelling to all those
   myriads of men and women which should have been born in all the
   generations of infinite and eternal ages; for so it must have been if
   man had not died at all, nor yet have removed hence at all. Neither is
   it likely that man's innocence should have lost to him all possibility
   of going thither, where the duration is better, measured by a better
   time, subject to fewer changes, and which is now the reward of a
   returning virtue which in all natural senses is less than innocence,
   save that it is heightened by Christ to an equality of acceptation with
   the state of innocence; but so it must have been that his innocence
   should have been punished with an eternal confinement to this state,
   which in all reason is the less perfect, the state of a traveler, not
   of one possessed of his inheritance. It is therefore certain man should
   have changed his abode; for so did Enoch, and so did Elias, and so
   shall all the world that shall be alive at the day of judgment; they
   shall not die, but they shall change their place and their abode, their
   duration and their state, and all this without death.

   That death, therefore, which God threatened to Adam, and which passed
   upon his posterity, is not the going out of this world, but the manner
   of going. If he had stayed in innocence, he should not have died by
   sickness, misfortune, defect, or unwillingness; but when he fell, then
   he began to die - the same day; (so said God;) and that must needs be
   true: and therefore it must mean that upon that very day he fell into
   an evil and dangerous condition, a state of change and affliction; then
   death began, that is, the man began to die by a natural diminution and
   aptness to disease and misery. His first state was and should have been
   (so long as it lasted) a happy duration; his second was a daily and
   miserable change; and this was the dying properly.

   This appears in the great instance of damnation, which, in the style of
   Scripture, is called eternal death; not because it kills or ends
   duration - it hath not so much good in it - but because it is a
   perpetual infelicity. Change or separation of soul and body is but
   accidental to death; death may be with or without either; but the
   formality, the curse, and the sting of death, that is, misery, sorrow,
   fear, diminution, defect, anguish, dishonour, and whatsoever is
   miserable and afflictive in nature, that is death. Death is not an
   action, but a whole state and condition; and this was first brought in
   upon us by the offence of one man.

   But this went no further than thus to subject us to temporal
   infelicity. If it had proceeded so far as was supposed, man had been
   much more miserable, for man had more than one original sin in this
   sense; and though this death entered first upon us by Adam's fault, yet
   it came nearer unto us, and increased upon us by the sins of more of
   our forefathers; for Adam's sin left us in strength enough to contend
   with human calamities for almost a thousand years together. But the
   sins of his children, our forefathers, took off from us half the
   strength about the time of the flood; and then from five hundred to two
   hundred and fifty, and from thence to one hundred and twenty, and from
   thence to threescore and ten; so often halving it till it is almost
   come to nothing. But by the sins of men in the several generations of
   the world, death, that is, misery and disease, is hastened so upon us
   that we are of a contemptible age; and because we are to die by
   suffering evils, and by the daily lessening of our strength and health,
   this death is so long a doing, that it makes so great a part of our
   short life useless and unserviceable, that we have not time enough to
   get the perfection of a single manufacture; but ten or twelve
   generations of the world must go to the making up of one wise man, or
   one excellent art; and in the succession of those ages there happen so
   many changes and interruptions, so many wars and violences, that seven
   years' fighting sets a whole kingdom back in learning and virtue to
   which they were creeping, it may be a whole age.

   And thus also we do evil to our posterity as Adam did to his, and Cham
   did to his, and Eli to his, and all they to theirs who by sins caused
   God to shorten the life and multiply the evils of mankind; and for this
   reason it is the world grows worse and worse, because so many original
   sins are multiplied, and so many evils from parents descend upon the
   succeeding generations of men, that they derive nothing from us but
   original misery.

   But he who restored the law of nature did also restore us to the
   condition of nature, which, being violated by the introduction of
   death, Christ then repaired when he suffered and overcame death for us;
   that is, he hath taken away the unhappiness of sickness and the sting
   of death, and the dishonurs of the grave, of dissolution and weakness,
   of decay and change, and hath turned them into acts of favour, into
   instances of comfort, into opportunities of virtue; Christ hath now
   knit them into rosaries and coronets; he hath put them into promises
   and rewards; he hath made them part of the portion of his elect: they
   are instruments and earnests, and securities and passage to the
   greatest perfection of human nature and the divine promises. So that it
   is possible for us now to be reconciled to sickness; it came in by sin,
   and therefore is cured when it is turned into virtue; and although it
   may have in it the uneasiness of labour, yet it will not be uneasy as
   sin, or the restlessness of a discomposed conscience. If therefore, we
   can well manage our state of sickness, that we may not fall by pain, as
   we usually do by pleasure, we need not fear; for no evil shall happen
   to us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION II.

    Of the First Temptation proper to the State of Sickness -- Impatience.

   Men that are in health are severe exactors of patience at the hands of
   them that are sick; and they usually judge it not by terms of relation
   between God and the suffering man, but between him and the friends that
   stand by the bed-side. It will be, therefore, necessary that we truly
   understand to what duties and actions the patience of a sick man ought
   to extend.

   1. Sighs and groans, sorrow and prayers, humble complaints and dolorous
   [64] expressions, are the sad accents of a sick man's language; for it
   is not to be expected that a sick man should act a part of patience
   with a countenance like an orator, or grave like a dramatic person; it
   were well if all men could bear an exterior decency in their sickness,
   and regulate their voice, their face, their discourse, and all their
   circumstances, by the measures and proportions of comeliness and
   satisfaction to all the standers by. But this would better please them
   than assist him; the sick man would do more good to others than he
   would receive to himself.

   2.Therefore silence and still composures, and not complaining, are no
   parts of a sick man's duty; they are not necessary parts of patience.
   [65] We find that David roared the the very disquietness of his
   sickness; and he lay chattering like a swallow, and his throat was dry
   with calling for help upon his God. That is the proper voice of
   sickness; and certain it is that the proper voices of sickness are
   expressly vocal and petitory in the ears of God, and call for pity in
   the same accent as the cries and oppressions of widows and orphans do
   for vengeance upon their persecutors, though they say no collect
   against them. For there is the voice of man, and there is the voice of
   the disease, and God hears both; and the louder the disease speaks,
   there is the greater need of mercy and pity, and therefore God will the
   sooner hear it. Abel's blood had a voice, and cried to God; and
   humility hath a voice, and cries so loud to God that it pierces the
   clouds; and so hath every sorrow and every sickness; and when a man
   cries out and complains but according to the sorrows of his pain, it
   cannot be any part of a culpable impatience, but an argument for pity.

   3. Some men's senses are so subtile, and their perceptions so quick and
   full of relish, and their spirits so active, that the same load is
   double upon them to what it is to another person; and therefore
   comparing the expressions of the one to the silence of the other, a
   different judgment cannot be made concerning their patience. Some
   natures are querulous and melancholy and soft and nice and tender and
   weeping and expressive; others are sullen, dull, without apprehension,
   apt to tolerate and carry burdens; and the crucifixion of our blessed
   Saviour falling upon a delicate and virgin body, of curious temper, and
   strict, equal composition, was naturally more full of torment than that
   of the ruder thieves, whose proportions were courser and uneven.

   4. In this case it was no imprudent advice which Cicero gave; [66]
   nothing in the world is more amiable than an even temper in our whole
   life, and in every action; but this evenness cannot be kept unless
   every man follows his own nature, without striving to imitate the
   circumstances of another. And what is so in the thing itself ought to
   be so in our judgments concerning the things. We must not call any one
   impatient if he be not silent in a fever, as if he were asleep, or as
   if he were dull as Herod's son of Athens.

   5. Nature in some cases hath made cryings out and exclamations to be an
   entertainment of the spirit, and an abatement or diversion of the pain.
   For so did the old champions when they threw their fatal nets that they
   might load their enemy with the snares and weights of death; they
   groaned aloud, and sent forth the anguish of their spirit into the eyes
   and heart of the man that stood against them; so it is in the endurance
   of some sharp pains, the complaints and shriekings, the sharp groans
   and the tender accents, send forth the afflicted spirits, and force a
   way that may ease their oppression and their load; that, when they have
   spent some of their sorrows by a sally forth, they may return better
   able to fortify the heart. Nothing of this is a certain sign, much less
   an action or part of impatience; and when our blessed Saviour suffered
   his last and sharpest pang of sorrow, he cried out with a loud voice,
   and resolved to die, and did so.

  SECTION III.

    Constituent or Integral Parts of Patience.

   1. That we may secure our patience we must take care that our
   complaints be without despair. Despair sins against the reputation of
   God's goodness, and the efficacy of all our old experience. By despair
   we destroy the greatest comfort of our sorrow's, and turn our sickness
   into the state of devils and perishing souls. No affliction is greater
   than despair; for that is it which makes hell-fire, and turn's a
   natural evil into an intolerable; it hinders prayers, and fills up the
   intervals of sickness with a worse torture; it makes all spiritual arts
   useless, and the office of spiritual comforters and guides to be
   impertinent.

   Against this; hope is to be opposed; and its proper acts, as it relates
   to the virtue and exercises of patient are, 1. Praying to God for help
   and remedy; 2. Sending for the guides of souls; 3. Using all holy
   exercises and acts of grace proper to that state, which whoso does hath
   not the impatience of despair; every man that is patient hath hope in
   God in the day of his sorrows.

   2. Our complaints in sickness must be without murmur. Murmur sins
   against God's providence and government; by it we grow rude, and, like
   the falling angels, displeased at God's supremacy; and nothing is more
   unreasonable - to talks against God, for whose glory all speech was
   made; it is proud and fantastic, hath better opinions of a sinner than
   of the Divine justice, and would rather accuse God than himself.

   Against this is opposed that part of patience which resigns the man
   into the hands of God, saying with old Eli, It is the Lord, let him do
   what he will;' and, Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven;' and
   so by admiring God's justice and wisdom does also dispose the sick
   person for receiving God's mercy, and secures him the rather in the
   grace of God. The proper acts of this part of patience are, 1. To
   confess our sins and our own demerits; 2. It increases and exercises
   humility; 3. It loves to sing praises to God, even from the lowest
   abyss of human misery.

   3. Our complaints in sickness must be without peevishness. This sins
   against civility and that necessary decency which must be used towards
   the ministers and assistants. By peevishness we increase our own
   sorrows, and are troublesome to them that stand there to ease ours. It
   hath in it harshness of nature and ungentleness, wilfulness and
   fantastic opinions, morosity and incivility.

   Against it are opposed obedience, tractability, easiness of persuasion,
   aptness to take counsel. The acts of this part of patience are, 1. To
   obey our physicians; 2. To treat our persons with respect to our
   present necessities; 3. Not to be ungentle and uneasy to the ministers
   and nurses that attend us, but to take their diligent and kind offices
   as sweetly as we can, and to bear their indiscretions or unhandsome
   accidents contentedly and without disquietness within, or evil language
   or angry words without; 4. Not to use unlawful means for our recovery.

   If we secure these particulars, we are not lightly to be judged of by
   noises and postures, by colours and images of things, by paleness, or
   tossing from side to side. For it were a hard thing that those persons
   who are loaden with the greatest of human calamities should be strictly
   tied to ceremonies and forms of things. He is patient that calls upon
   God; that hopes for health or heaven; that believes God is wise and
   just in sending him afflictions; that confesses his sins, and accuses
   himself and justifies God; that expects God will turn this into good;
   that is civil to his physicians and his servants; that converses with
   the guides of souls, the ministers of religion; and in all things
   submits to God's will, and would use no indirect means for his
   recovery; but had rather be sick and die than enter at all into God's
   displeasure.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION IV.

    Remedies against Impatience, by way of Consideration.

   As it happens concerning death, so it is in sickness, which is death's
   handmaid. It hath the fate to suffer calumny and reproach, and hath a
   name worse than its nature.

   1. For there is no sickness so great but children endure it, and have
   natural strengths to bear them out quite through the calamity, what
   period soever nature hath allotted it. Indeed they make no reflections
   upon their sufferings, and complain of sickness with an uneasy sigh or
   a natural groan, but consider not what the sorrows of sickness mean;
   and so bear it by a direct sufferance, and as a piller bears the weight
   of a roof. But, then, why cannot we bear it so too? For this which we
   all a reflection upon, or a considering of our sickness, is nothing but
   a perfect instrument of trouble, and consequently a temptation to
   impatience. It serves no end of nature; it may be avoided, and we may
   consider it only as an expression of God's anger, and an emissary or
   procurator of repentance. But all other considering it, [67] except
   where it serves the purposes of medicine and art, is nothing but, under
   the colour of reason, and unreasonable device to heighten the sickness
   and increase the torment. But, then, as children want this act of
   reflex perception or reasonable sense whereby they should be able to
   support it. For certain it is, reason was as well given us to harden
   our spirits, and stiffen them in passions and sad accidents, as to make
   us bending and apt for action; and if in men God hath heightened the
   faculties of apprehension, he hath increased the auxiliaries of
   reasonable strengths; that God's rod and God's staff might go together,
   and the beam of God's countenance may as well refresh us with its light
   as scorch us with its heat. For poor children that endure so much have
   not inward supports and refreshments to bear them through it; they
   never heard the sayings of old men, nor have been taught the principles
   of severe philosophy, nor are assisted with the results of a long
   experience, nor know they how to turn a sickness into virtue, and a
   fever into a reward; nor have they any sense of favours, the
   remembrance of which may alleviate their burden; and yet nature hath in
   them teeth and nails enough to scratch and fight against the sickness,
   and by such aids as God is pleased to give them they wade through the
   storm and murmur not. And besides this, yet, although infants have not
   such brisk perceptions upon the stock of reason, they have a more
   tender feelings upon the accounts of sense, and their flesh is as
   uneasy by their natural softness and weak shoulders as ours by too
   forward apprehensions. Therefore bear up; either you, or I, or some man
   wiser, and many a woman weaker than us both, or the very children, have
   endured worse evil than this that is upon thee now.

   That sorrow is hugely tolerable which gives its smart but by instants
   and smallest proportions of time. No man at once feels the sickness of
   a week or of a whole day, but the smart of an instant; and still every
   portion of a minute feels but its proper share; and the last groan
   ended all the sorrow of its peculiar burden. And what minute can that
   be which can pretend to be intolerable? and the next minute is but the
   same as the last, and the pain flows like the drops of a river, or the
   little shreds of time; and if we do but take care of the present
   minute, it cannot seem a great charge or a great burden; but that care
   will secure our duty, if we still but secure the present minute.

   3. If we consider how much men can suffer if they list, and how much
   they do suffer for greater and little causes, and that no causes are
   greater than the proper causes of patience in sickness, (that is
   necessity and religion,) we cannot, without huge shame to our nature,
   to our persons, and to our manners, complain of this tax and impost of
   nature. This experience added something to the old philosophy. When the
   gladiators were exposed naked to each other's short swords, and were to
   cut each other's souls away in portions of flesh, as it their forms had
   been as divisible as the life of worms, they did not sigh or groan - it
   was a shame to decline the blow but according to the just measures of
   art. The women that saw the wound shriek out; and he that receives it
   holds his peace. he did not only stand bravely, but would also fall so;
   and, when he was down, scorned to shirk his head when the insolent
   conqueror came to lift it from his shoulders; and yet this man, in his
   first design, only aimed at liberty, and the reputation of a good
   fencer; and when he sunk down he saw he could only receive the honour
   of a bold man, the noise of which he shall never hear when his ashes
   are crammed in his narrow urn. And what can we complain of the weakness
   of our strengths or the pressures of diseases, when we see a poor
   soldier stand in a breach almost starved with cold and hunger, and his
   cold apt to be relieved only by the heats of anger, a fever, or a fired
   musket, and his hunger slackened by a greater pain and a huge fear?
   This man shall stand in his arms and wounds, patiens luminis alque
   solis, pale and faint, weary and watchful; and at night shall have a
   bullet pulled out of his flesh, and shivers from his bones, and endure
   his mouth to be sewed up from a violent rent to its own demension; and
   all this for a man whom he never saw, or, if he did, was not noted by
   him; but one that shall condemn him to the gallows if he runs from all
   this misery. It is seldom that God sends such calamities upon men as
   men bring upon themselves and suffer willingly. But that which is most
   considerable is, that any passion and violence upon the spirit of man
   makes him able to suffer huge calamities with a certain constancy and
   an unwearied patience. Scipio Africanus was wont to commend that saying
   in Xenophon, That the same labours of warfare were easier far to a
   general than to a common soldier; because he was supported by the huge
   appetites of honour, which made his hard marches nothing but stepping
   forward and reaching at a triumph. Did not the lady of Sabinus, for
   others' interest, bear twins privately and without groaning? Are not
   the labours and cares, the spare diet and the waking nights, of
   covetous and adulterous, of ambitious and revengeful persons, greater
   sorrows and of more smart than a fever, or the short pains of
   child-birth? What will not tender women suffer to hide their shame? And
   if vice and passion, lust and inferior appetites, can supply to the
   tenderest persons strengths more than enough for the sufferance of the
   greatest natural violences, can we suppose that honesty and religion
   and the grace of God are more nice, tender, and effeminate?

   4. Sickness is the more tolerable, because it cures very many evils,
   and takes away the sense of all the cross fortunes which amaze the
   spirits of some men, and transports them certainly beyond all the
   limits of patience. Here all losses and disgraces, domestic cares and
   public evils, the apprehensions of pity and a sociable calamity, the
   fears of want and the troubles of ambition, lie down and rest upon the
   sick man's pillow. One fit of the stone takes away from the fancies of
   men all relations to the world and secular interests: at least they are
   made dull and flat, without sharpness and edge.

   And he that shall observe the infinite variety of troubles which
   afflict some busy persons and almost all men in very busy times, will
   think it not much amiss, that those huge numbers were reduced to
   certainty, to method and an order; and there is no better compendium
   for this than that they be reduced to one. And a sick man seem so
   unconcerned in the things of the world, that although this separation
   be done with violence, yet it is no otherwise than all noble
   contentions are, and all honours are purchased, and all virtues are
   acquired, and all vices mortified, and all appetites chastised, and all
   rewards obtained; there is infallibly to all these a difficulty and a
   sharpness annexed, without which there could be no proportion between a
   work and a reward. To this add that sickness does not take off the
   sense of secular troubles and worldly cares from us, by employing all
   the perceptions and apprehensions of men; by filling all faculties with
   sorrow, and leaving no room for the lesser instances of troubles, as
   little rivers are swallowed up in the sea; but sickness is a messenger
   of God, sent with purposes of abstraction and separation, with a secret
   power and a proper efficacy to draw us off from unprofitable and
   useless sorrows: and this is effected partly by reason that it
   represents the uselessness of the things of this world, and that there
   is a portion of this life in which honours and things of the world
   cannot serve us to many purposes; partly by preparing us to death, and
   telling us that a man shall descend thither, whence this world cannot
   redeem us, and where the goods of this world cannot serve us.

   5. And yet, after all this, sickness leaves in us appetites so strong,
   and apprehensions so sensible, and delights so many, and good things in
   so great a degree that a healthless body and a sad disease do seldom
   make men weary of this world, but still they would fain find an excuse
   to live. [68] The gout, the stone, and the tooth-ache, the sciatica,
   sore eyes, and an aching head, are evils indeed; but such which, rather
   than die, most men are willing to suffer; and Mecaenas added also a
   wish rather to be crucified than to die, and though his wish was low,
   timorous, and base, yet we find the same desires in most men, dressed
   up with better circumstances. It was a cruel mercy in Tamerland, who
   commanded all the leprous persons to be put to death, as we knock some
   beasts quickly on their head to put them out of pain, and lest they
   should live miserably; the poor men would rather have endured another
   leprosy, and have more willingly taken two diseases than one death.
   Therefore Caesar wondered that the old crazed soldier begged leave he
   might kill himself, and asked him, "Dost thou think then to be more
   alive than now thou art?" We do not die suddenly, but we descend to
   death by steps and slow passages; and therefore men (so long as they
   are sick) are unwilling to proceed and go forward in the finishing of
   that sad employment. Between a disease and death there are many
   degrees, and all those are like the reserves of evil things, the
   declining of every one of which is justly reckoned amongst those good
   things which alleviate the sickness and make it tolerable. Never
   account that sickness intolerable in which thou hadst rather remain
   than die: and yet if thou hadst rather die than suffer it, the worst of
   it that can be said is this, that this sickness is worse than death;
   that is, it is worse than that which is the best of all evils, and the
   end of all troubles; and then you have said no great harm against it.

   6. Remember that thou art under a supervening necessity. Nothing is
   intolerable that is necessary; and therefore when men are to suffer a
   sharp incission, or what they are pleased to call intolerable, tie the
   man down to it, and he endures it. [69] Now God hath bound this
   sickness upon thee by the condition of nature; for every flower must
   wither and droop; it is also bound upon thee by special providence, and
   with a design to try thee, and with purposes to reward and to crown
   thee. These cords thou canst not break; and therefore lie thou down
   gently, and suffer the hand of God to do what he please, that at least
   thou mayst swallow an advantage which the care and severe mercies of
   God force down thy throat.

   7. Remember that all men have passed this way; the bravest, the wisest,
   and the best men have been subject to sickness and sad diseases; and it
   is esteemed a prodigy that a man should live to a long age and not be
   sick; and it is recorded for a wonder concerning Xenophilus the
   musician, that he lived to one hundred and six years of age in a
   perfect and continual health. No story tells the like of a prince, or a
   great or a wise person; [70] unless we have a mind to believe the tales
   concerning Nestor and the Euhoean Sybil, or reckon Cyrus of Persia, or
   Masinissa the Mauritanian, to be rivals of old age, or that Argantonius
   the Tartesian king did really outstrip that age, according as his story
   tells, reporting him to have reigned eighty years, [71] and to have
   lived one hundred and twenty. Old age and healthful bodies are seldom
   made the appendages to great fortunes; and under so great and so
   universal precedents, [72] so common fate of men, he that will not
   suffer his portion deserves to be something else than a man, but
   nothing that is better.

   8. We find in story that many Gentiles, who walked by no light but that
   of reason, opinion, and human examples, did bear their sickness nobly,
   and with great contempt of pain, and with huge interests of virtue.
   When Pompey came from Syria, and called at Rhodes, to see Posidonins
   the philosopher, he found him hugely afflicted with the gout, and
   expressed his sorrow that he could not hear his lectures, from which by
   this pain he must needs be hindered. Posidonius told him, "But you may
   hear me for all this;" and he discoursed excellently in the midst of
   his tortures, even then when the torches were put to his feet, [73]
   "That nothing was good but what was honest," and therefore "nothing
   could be an evil if it were not criminal;" and summed up his lectures
   with this saying, "O pain, in vain dost thou attempt me, for I will
   never confess thee to be an evil, as long as I can honestly bear thee."
   And when Pompey himself was desperately sick at Naples, the Neapolitans
   wore crowns and triumphed, and the men of Puteoli came to congratulate
   his sickness, not because they loved him not, but because it was the
   custom of their country to have better opinions of sickness than we
   have. The boys of Sparta would, at their alters, endure whipping till
   their very entrails saw the light through their torn flesh; and some of
   them to death, without crying or complaint. Caesar would drink his
   portions of rhubarb rudely mixed, and unfitly allayed, with little
   sippings, and taking the horrow of the medicine, spreading the
   loathsomeness of his physic so, that all the parts of his tongue and
   palate might have an entire share; and when C. Marius suffered the
   veins of his leg to be cut out for the curing his gout, and yet shrunk
   not, he declared not only the rudeness of their physic, but the
   strength of a man's spirit, if it be contracted and united by the aids
   of reason or religion, by resolution or any accidental harshness,
   against a violent disease.

   9. All impatience, howsoever expressed, is perfectly useless to all
   purposes of ease, but hugely effective to the multiplying the trouble;
   and the impatience and vexation is another, but the sharper disease of
   the two: it does mischief by itself, and mischief by the disease. For
   men grieve themselves as much as they please; [74] and when, by
   impatience, they put themselves into the retune of sorrows, they become
   solemn mourners. For so I have seen the rays of the sun or moon dash
   upon a brazen vessel, whose lips kissed the face of those waters that
   lodged within its bosom; but being turned back, and sent off with its
   smooth pretences or rougher waftings, it wandered about the room, and
   beat upon the roof, and still doubled its heat and motion. So is a
   sickness and a sorrow, entertained by an unquiet and a discontented
   man, turned back either with anger or with excuses; but then the pain
   passes from the stomach to the liver, and from the liver to the heart,
   and from the heart to the head, and from feeling to consideration, from
   thence to sorrow, and at last ends in impatience and useless murmur;
   and all the way the man was impotent and weak, but the sickness was
   doubled, and grew imperious and tyrannical over the soul and body.
   Masuriun Sabinus tells that the image of the goddess Angerona was, with
   a muffler upon her mouth, placed upon the altar of Volupia, to
   represent that those persons who bear their sicknesses and sorrows
   without murmurs shall certainly pass from sorrow to pleasure, and the
   ease and honours of felicity; but they that with spite and indignation
   bite the burning coal, or shake the yoke upon their necks, gall their
   spirits, and fret the skin, and hurt nothing but themselves.

   10. Remember that this sickness is but for a short time: if it be
   sharp, it will not last long; if it be long, it will be easy and very
   tolerable. And although St. Eadsine, archbishop of Canterbury, had
   twelve years of sickness, yet all that while he ruled his church
   prudently, gave example of many virtues, and, after his death, was
   enrolled in the calendar of saints who had finished their course
   prosperously. Nothing is more unreasonable than to entangle our spirits
   in wildness and amazement, like a partridge fluttering in a net which
   she breaks not, though she breaks her wings.

  SECTION V.

    Remedies against Impatience, by way of Exercise.

   1. The fittest instrument of esteeming sickness easily tolerable is, to
   remember that which indeed makes it so; and that is, that God doth
   minister proper aids and supports to every of his servants whom he
   visits with his rod. He knows our needs, he pities our sorrows, he
   relieves our miseries, he supports our weakness, he bids us ask for
   help, and he promises to give us all that, and he usually give us more;
   and indeed it is observable, that no story tells of any godly man who,
   living in the fear of God fell into a violent and unpardoned impatience
   in his natural sickness, if he used those means which God and his holy
   church have appointed. We see almost all men bear their last sickness
   with sorrows indeed, but without violent passions; and unless they fear
   death violently, they suffer the sickness with some indifferency: and
   it is a rare thing to see a man who enjoys his reason in his sickness
   to express the proper signs of a direct and solemn impatience. For when
   God lays a sickness upon us, he seizes commonly on a man's spirits,
   which are the instruments of action and business; and when they are
   secured from being tumultuous, the sufferance is much the easier: and
   therefore sickness secures all that which can do the man mischief; it
   makes him tame and passive, apt for suffering, and confines him to an
   inactive condition. To which, if we add, that God then commonly
   produces fear, and all those passions which naturally tend to humility
   and poverty of spirit, we shall soon perceive by what instruments God
   verifies his promise to us, (which is the great security for our
   patience, and the easiness of our condition,) that God will lay no more
   upon us than he will make us able to bear it, but together with the
   affliction, he will find a way to escape. [75] Nay, if anything can be
   more than this, we have two or three promises in which we may safely
   lodge ourselves, and roll from off our thorns, and find ease and rest;
   God hath promised to be with us in our trouble, and to be with us in
   our prayers, and to be with us in our hope and confidence. [76]

   2. Prevent the violence and trouble of thy spirit by an act of
   thanksgiving; for which in the worst of sickness thou canst not want
   cause, especially if thou rememberest that this pain is not an eternal
   pain. Bless God for that: but take heed, also, lest you so order your
   affairs that you pass from hence to an eternal sorrow. If that be hard,
   this will be intolerable: but as for the present evil, a few day will
   end it.

   3. Remember that thou art a man and a Christian: as the covenant of
   nature hath made it necessary, so the covenant of grace hath made it to
   be chosen by thee, to be a suffering person: either you must renounce
   your religion or submit to the impositions of God and thy portion of
   sufferings. So there here we see our advantages, and let us use them
   accordingly. The barbarous and warlike nations of old could fight well
   and willingly, but could not bear sickness manfully. The Greeks were
   cowardly in their fights, as most wise men are; but because they were
   learned and well taught, they bore their sickness with patience and
   severity. The Cim rians and Celtiberians rejoice in battle, like
   giants; but in their diseases they weep like women. These according to
   their institution and designs had unequal courages and accidental
   fortitude. But since our religion hath made a covenant of sufferings,
   and the great business of our lives is sufferings, and most of the
   virtues of a Christian are passive graces, and all the promises of the
   gospel are passed upon us through Christ's cross, we have a necessity
   upon us to have an equal courage in all the variety of our sufferings;
   for without an universal fortitude we can do nothing of our duty.

   4. Resolve to do as much as you can; for certain it is, we can suffer
   much if we list; and many men have afflicted themselves unreasonably by
   not being skilful to consider how much their strength and state could
   permit; and our flesh is nice and imperious, crafty to persuade reason
   that she hath more necessities than indeed belong to her, and that she
   demands nothing superfluous. Suffer as much in obedience to God as you
   can suffer for necessity or passion, fear or desire. And if you can for
   one thing, you can for another; and there is nothing wanting but the
   mind. Never say, I can do no more; I cannot endure this; for God would
   not have sent it if he had not known thee strong enough to abide it;
   only he that knows thee well already would also take this occasion to
   make thee know thyself; but it will be fit that you pray to God to give
   you a discerning spirit, that you may rightly distinguish just
   necessity from the flattery and fondness of flesh and blood.

   5. Propound to your eyes and heart the example of the holy Jesus upon
   the cross; he endured more for thee than thou canst either for thyself
   or him: and remember, that if we be put to suffer, and do suffer in a
   good cause, or in a good manner, so that in any sense your sufferings
   be conformable to his sufferings, or can be capable of being united to
   his, we shall reign together with him. The highway of the cross, which
   the King of sufferings hath trodden before us, is the way to ease, to a
   kingdom, and to felicity.

   6. The very suffering is a title to an excellent inheritance; for God
   chastens every son whom he receives; and if we be not chastised, we are
   bastards, and not sons. And be confident, that although God often sends
   pardon without correction, yet he never sends correction without
   pardon, unless it be thy fault: and therefore take every or any
   affliction as an earnest-penny of thy pardon; and upon condition there
   may be peace with God, let anything be welcome that he can send as its
   instrument or condition. Suffer, therefore, God to choose his own
   circumstances of adopting thee, and be content to be under discipline,
   when the reward of that is to become the son of God: and by such
   inflictions he hews and breaks thy body, first dressing it to funeral,
   and then preparing it for immortality. And if this be effect of the
   design of God's love to thee, let it be occasion of thy love to him;
   and remember, that the truth of love is hardly known but by somewhat
   that puts us to pain.

   7. Use this as a punishment for thy sins; and so God intends it most
   commonly; that is certain: if therefore thou submittest to it, thou
   approvest of the Divine judgment; and no man can have cause to complain
   of anything but himself, if either he believes God to be just or
   himself to be a sinner. If he either thinks he hath deserved hell, or
   that this little may be a means to prevent the greater and bring him to
   heaven.

   8. It may be, that this may be the last instance and the last
   opportunity that ever God will give thee to exercise any virtue, to do
   him any service, or thyself any advantage: be careful that thou losest
   not this; for to eternal ages this never shall return again.

   9. Or if thou, peradventure, shalt be restored to health, be careful
   that in the day of thy thanksgiving thou mayst not be ashamed of
   thyself for having behaved thyself poorly and weakly upon thy bed. It
   will be a sensible and excellent comfort to thee, and double upon thy
   spirit, if, when thou shalt worship God for restoring thee, thou shalt
   also remember that thou didst do him service in thy suffering, and tell
   that God was hugely gracious to thee in giving thee the opportunity of
   a virtue at so easy a rate as a sickness from which thou didst recover.

   10. Few men are so sick but they believe that they may recover; and we
   shall seldom see a man lie down with a perfect persuasion that it is
   his last hour; for many men have been sicker, and yet have recovered;
   but whether thou dost or no, thou hast a virtue to exercise which may
   be a handmaid to thy patience. Epaphroditus was sick, sick, unto death;
   and yet God had mercy upon him: and he hath done so to thousands to
   whom he found it useful in the great order of things and the events of
   universal providence. If, therefore, thou desirest to recover, here is
   cause enough of hope; and hope is designed in the arts of God and of
   the Spirit to support patience. But if thou recoverest not, yet there
   is something that is matter of joy naturally, and very much
   spiritually, of thou belongest to God; and joy is as certain a support
   to patience as hope: and it is no small cause of being pleased, when we
   remember that, if we recover not, our sickness shall the sooner sit
   down in rest and joy. For recovery by death, as it is easier and better
   than the recovery by a sickly health, so it is not so long in doing: it
   suffers not the tediousness of a creeping restitution, nor the
   inconvenience of surgeons and physicians, watchfulness and care,
   keepings in and suffering trouble, fears of relapse, and the little
   relics of a storm.

   11. While we hear, or use, or think of these remedies, part of the
   sickness is gone away, and all of it is passing. And if by such
   instruments we stand armed and ready dressed beforehand, we shall avoid
   the mischiefs of amazements and surprise; [77] while the accidents of
   sickness are such as were expected, and against which, we stood in
   readiness, with our spirits contracted, instructed, and put upon the
   defensive.

   12. But our patience will be the better secured if we consider that it
   is not violently tempted by the usual arrests of sickness; for patience
   is with reason demanded while the sickness is tolerable, that is, so
   long as the evil is not too great; but if it be also eligible, and have
   in it some degrees of good, our patience will have in it the less
   difficulty and the greater necessity. This therefore will be a new
   stock of consideration: sickness is in many degrees eligible to many
   men and to many purposes.

  SECTION VI.

    Advantages of Sickness.

   1. I consider one of the greatest felicities of heaven consists in an
   immunity from sin: then we shall love God without mixtures of malice;
   then we shall enjoy without envy; then we shall see fuller vessels
   running over with glory, and crowned with bigger circles; and this we
   shall behold without spilling from our eyes (those vessels of joy and
   grief) any sign of anger, trouble, or a repining spirit: our passions
   shall be pure, our charity without fear, our desire without lust, our
   possessions all our own; and all in the inheritance of Jesus, in the
   richest soil of God's eternal kingdom. Now half of this reason, which
   makes heaven so happy by being innocent, is also in the state of
   sickness, making the sorrows of old age smooth, and the groans of a
   sick heart apt to be joined to the music of angels: and, though they
   sound harsh to our untuned ears and discomposed organs, yet those
   accents must needs be in themselves excellent which God loves to hear,
   and esteems them as prayers, and arguments of pity, instruments of
   mercy and grace, and preparatives to glory.

   In sickness the soul begins to dress herself for immortality. And,
   first, she unties the strings of vanity that made her upper garment
   cleave to the world and sit uneasy; first, she puts off the light and
   fantastic summer robe of lust and wanton appetite; and as soon as that
   cestus, that lascivious girdle is thrown away, then the reins chasten
   us, and give us warning in the night; then that which called us
   formerly to serve the manliness of the body, and the childishness of
   the soul, keeps us waking, to divide the hours with the intervals of
   prayer, and to number the minutes with our penitential groans; then the
   flesh sets uneasily and dwells in sorrow; and then the spirit feels
   itself at ease, freed from the petulant solicitations of those passions
   which in health were as busy and restless as atoms in the sun, always
   dancing, and always busy, and never sitting down, till a sad night of
   grief and uneasiness draws the veil, and lets them die alone in secret
   dishonour.

   2. Next to this, the soul, by the help of sickness, knocks off the
   fetters of pride and vainer complacencies. Then she draws the curtains,
   and stops the light from coming in, and takes the pictures down, those
   fantastic images of self-love [78] and gay remembrances of vain opinion
   and popular noises. Then the spirit stoops into the sobrieties of
   humble thoughts, and feels corruption chiding the forwardness of fancy,
   and allaying the vapours of conceit and factious opinions. For humility
   is the soul's grave, into which she enters, not to die, but to meditate
   and inter some of its troublesome appendages. There she sees the dust,
   and feels the dishonours of the body, and reads the register of all its
   sad adherences; and then she lays by all her vain reflections, beating
   upon her crystal and pure mirror from the fancies of strength and
   beauty, and little decayed prettinesses of the body. And when, in
   sickness, we forget all our knotty discourses of philosophy, and a
   syllogism makes our head ache, and we feel our many and loud talkings
   served no lasting end of the soul, no purpose that now we must abide
   by, and that the body is like to descend to the land where all things
   are forgotten; then she lays aside all her remembrances of applauses,
   all her ignorant confidences, and ares only to know "Christ Jesus and
   him crucified," to know him plainly, and with much heartiness and
   simplicity. And I cannot think this to be a contemptible advantage. For
   ever since man tempted himself by his impatient desires of knowing and
   being as God, man thinks it the finest thing in the world to know much,
   and therefore is hugely apt to esteem himself better than his brethren
   if he knows some little impertinences, and them imperfectly, and that
   with infinite uncertainty; but God hath been pleased, with a rare art,
   to prevent the inconveniences apt to arise by this passionate longing
   after knowledge, even by giving to every man a sufficient opinion of
   his own understanding: and who is there in the world that thinks
   himself to be a fool, or indeed not fit to govern his brother? There
   are but few men but they think they are wise enough, and every man
   believes his own opinion the soundest; and, if it were otherwise, men
   would burst themselves with envy, or else become irrecoverable slaves
   to the talking and disputing man. But when God intended this permission
   to be an antidote of envy, and a satisfaction and allay to the
   troublesome appetites of knowing, and made that this universal opinion,
   by making men in some proportions equal, should be a keeper-out or a
   great restraint to slavery and tyranny respectively; man (for so he
   uses to do) hath turned this into bitterness; for when nature had made
   so just a distribution of understanding that every man might think he
   had enough, he is not content with that, but will think he hath more
   than his brother; and whereas it might well be employed in restraining
   slavery, he hath used it to break off the bands of all obedience, and
   it ends in pride and schisms, in heresies and tyrannies; and it being a
   spiritual evil, it grows upon the soul with old age and flattery, with
   health and the supports of a prosperous fortune. Now, besides the
   direct operations of the Spirit, and a powerful grace, there is in
   nature left to us no remedy for this evil but a sharp sickness, or an
   equal sorrow, and allay of fortune; and then we are humble enough to
   ask counsel of a despised priest, and to think that even a common
   sentence, from the mouth of an appointed comforter streams forth more
   refreshment than all our own wiser and more reputed discourses; then
   our understandings and our bodies, peeping through their own breaches,
   see their shame and their dishonour, their dangerous follies and their
   huge deceptions; and they go into the clefts of the rock, and every
   little hand may cover them.

   3. Next to these, as the soul is still undressing, she takes off the
   roughness of her great and little angers and animosities, and receives
   the oil of mercies and smooth forgiveness, fair interpretations and
   gentle answers, designs of reconcilement and Christian atonement in
   their places. For so did the wrestlers in Olympus; they stripped
   themselves of all their garments, and then anointed their naked bodies
   with oil, smooth and vigorous; with contracted nerves and enlarged
   voice they contended vehemently, till they obtained their victory or
   their ease; and a crown of olive, or a huge pity, was the reward of
   their fierce contentions. Some wise men have said, than anger sticks to
   a man's nature as inseparable as other vices do to the manner of fools,
   and that anger is never quite cured: but God, that hath found out
   remedies for all diseases, hath so ordered the circumstances of man,
   that in the worser sort of men anger and great indignation consume and
   shrivel into little peevishnesses and uneasy accents of sickness, and
   spend themselves in trifling instances; and in the better and more
   sanctified it goes off in prayers and alms and solemn reconcilement.
   And, however the temptations of this state, such, I mean, which are
   proper to it, are little and considerable, the man is apt to chide a
   servant too bitterly, and to be discontented with his nurse, or not
   satisfied with his physician, and he rests uneasily, and (poor man!)
   nothing can please him: and indeed these little indecencies must be
   cured and stopped, lest they run into an inconvenience. But sickness
   is, in this particular, a little image of the state of blessed souls,
   or of Adam's early morning in paradise, free from the troubles of lust,
   and violences of anger, and the intricacies of ambition, or the
   restlessness of covetousness. For though a man may carry all these
   along with him into his sickness, yet there he will not find them; and
   in despite of all his own malice, his soul shall find some rest from
   labouring in the galleys and baser captivity of sin: and if e value
   those moments of being in the love of God and in the kingdom of grace,
   which certainly are the beginnings of felicity, we may also remember
   that the not sinning actually is one step of innocence; and therefore
   that state is not intolerable which, by a sensible trouble, makes it in
   most instances impossible to commit those great sins which make death,
   hell, and horrid damnations. And then let us but add this to it, that
   God sends sicknesses, but he never causes sin; that God is angry with a
   sinning person, but never with a man for being sick; that sin causes
   God to hate us, and sickness causes him to pity us; that all wise men
   in the world choose trouble rather than dishonour, affliction rather
   than baseness; and that sickness stops the torrent of sin, and
   interrupts its violence, and even to the worst men makes it to retreat
   many degrees. We may reckon sickness amongst good things, as we reckon
   rhubarb and aloes and childbirth and labour and obedience and
   discipline; these are unpleasant, and yet safe; they are troubles in
   order to blessings, or they are securities from danger, or the hard
   choices of a less and a more tolerable evil.

   4. Sickness, is in some sense elegible, because it is the opportunity
   and the proper scene of exercising some virtues. [79] It is that agony
   in which men are tried for a crown. And if we remember what glorious
   things are spoken of the grace of faith, that it is the life of just
   men, the restitution of the dead in trespasses and sins, the
   justification of a sinner, the support of the weak, the confidence of
   the strong, the magazine of promises, and the title to very glorious
   rewards: we may easily imagine that it must have in it a work and a
   difficulty in some proportion answerable to so great effects. But when
   we are bidden to believe strange propositions, we are put upon it when
   we cannot judge, and those propositions have possessed our discerning
   faculties, and have made a party there, and are become domestic before
   they come to be disputed; and then the articles of faith are so few,
   and are made so credible, and in their event and in their object are so
   useful and gaining upon the affections, that he were a prodigy of man,
   and would be so esteemed, that should, in all our present
   circumstances, disbelieve any point of faith: and all is well as long
   as the sun shines, and the fair breath of heaven gently wafts us to our
   own purposes. But if you will try the excellency, and feel the work of
   faith, place the man in a persecution, let him ride in a storm, let his
   bones be broken with sorrow, and his eyelids loosened with sickness,
   let his bread be dipped in tears, and all the daughters of music be
   brought low; let God commence a quarrel against him, and be bitter in
   the accents of his anger or his discipline; then God tries your faith.
   Can you, then, trust his goodness, and believe him to be a father, when
   you groan under his rod? Can you rely upon all the strange propositions
   of Scripture, and be content to perish if they be not true? Can you
   receive comfort in the discourses of death and heaven, of immortality
   and the resurrection, of the death of Christ and conforming to his
   sufferings? Truth is, there are but two great periods in which faith
   demonstrates itself to be a powerful and mighty grace; and they are
   persecution and the approaches of death, for the passive part, and a
   temptation for the active. In the days of pleasure and the night of
   pain faith is to fight her agonistiun, to contend for mastery: and
   faith overcomes all alluring and fond temptations to sin, and faith
   overcomes all our weaknesses and faintings in our troubles. By the
   faith of the promises we learn to despise the world, choosing those
   objects which faith discovers; and by expectation of the same promises,
   we are comforted in all our sorrows, and enabled to look through and
   see beyond the cloud: but the vigour of it is pressed and called forth
   when all our fine discourses come to be reduced to practice. For in our
   health and clearer days it is easy to talk of putting trust in God;
   [80] we readily trust him for life when we are in health; for
   provisions when we have fair revenues; and for deliverance when we are
   newly escaped: but let us come to sit upon the margent of our grave,
   and let a tyrant lean hard upon our fortunes and dwell upon our wrong,
   let the strom arise, and the keels toss till the cordage crack, or that
   all our hopes bulge under us and descend into the hollowness of sad
   misfortunes; then can you believe, when you neither hear, nor see, nor
   feel anything but objections? This is the proper work of sickness:
   faith is then brought into the theatre, and so exercised, that if it
   abides but to the end of the contention we may see the work of faith
   which God will hugely crown. The same I say of hope and of charity, of
   the love of God and of patience, which is a grace produced from the
   mixtures of all these: they are virtues which are greedy of danger; and
   no man was ever honoured by any wise or discerning person for dining
   upon Persian carpets, nor rewarded with a crown for being at ease. [81]
   It was the fire that did honour to Mutius Scaevola; poverty made
   Fabricius famous; Rutilius was made excellent by banishment; Regulus by
   torments; Socrates by prison; Cato by his death; and God hath crowned
   the memory of Job with a wreath of glory because he sat upon his
   dunghill wisely and temperately; and his potsherd and his groans,
   mingled with praises and justifications of God, pleased him like an
   anthem sung by angels in the morning of the resurrection. God could not
   choose but be pleased with the delicious accents of martyrs, when in
   their tortures they cried out nothing but Holy Jesus' and Blessed be
   God;' and they also themselves who, with a hearty designation to the
   divine pleasure, can delight in God's severe dispensation, will have
   the transportations of cherubim when they enter into the joys of God.
   If God be delicious to his servants when he smites them, he will be
   nothing but ravishments and ecstasies to their spirits when he
   refreshes them with the overflowings of joy in the day of recompenses.
   No man is more miserable than he that hath no adversity; that man is
   not tried, [82] whether he be good or bad: and God never crowns those
   virtues which are only faculties and dispositions; but every act of
   virtue is an ingredient into reward. And we see many children fairly
   planted, whose parts of nature were never dressed by art, nor called
   from the furrows of their first possibilities by discipline and
   institution; and they dwell for ever in ignorance, and converse with
   beasts; and yet, if they had been dressed and exercised, might have
   stood at the chairs of princes, or spoken parables amongst the rulers
   of cities. Our virtues are but in the seed when the grace of God comes
   upon us first; but this grace must be thrown into broken furrows, and
   must twice feel the cold, and twice feel the heat, and be softened with
   storms and showers; and then it will arise into fruitfulness and
   harvests. And what is there in the world to distinguish virtues from
   dishonours, or the valour of Caesar from the softness of the Egyptian
   eunuchs, or that can make anything rewardable, but the labour and the
   danger, the pain and the difficulty? Virtue could not be anything but
   sensuality if it were the entertainment of our senses and fond desires;
   and Apicius had been the noblest of all the Romans if feeding a great
   appetite and despising the severities of temperance had been the work
   and proper employment of a wise man. But otherwise do fathers and
   otherwise do mothers handle their children. These soften them with
   kisses and imperfect noises, with the pap and breast-milk of soft
   endearments; they rescue them from tutors and snatch them from
   discipline; they desire to keep them fat and warm, and their feet dry,
   and their bellies full; and then the children govern and cry and prove
   fools and troublesome, so long as the feminine republic does endure.
   But fathers, because they design to have their children wise and
   valiant, apt for counsel or tie them to study, to hard labour, and
   affective contingencies. They rejoice when the bold boy strikes a lion
   with his hunting spear, and shrinks not when the beast comes to
   affright his early courage. Softness is for slaves and beasts, [83] for
   minstrels and useless persons, for such who cannot ascend higher that
   the state of a fair ox, or a servant entertained for vainer offices:
   but the man that designs his son for noble employments, to honours and
   to triumphs, to consular dignities and presidencies of councils, loves
   to see him pale with study, or panting with labour, burdened with
   sufferance, or eminent by dangers. And so God dresses us for heaven. He
   loves us struggling with a disease, and resisting the devil, and
   contesting against the weaknesses of nature, and against hope to
   believe in hope, resigning ourselves to God's will, praying him to
   choose for us, and dying in all things but faith and its blessed
   consequences; ut ad officium cum pericule simus prompti: and the danger
   and the resistance shall endear the office. For so have I known the
   boisterous north wind pass through the yielding air, [84] which opened
   its bosom and appeased its violence by entertaining it with easy
   compliance in all the regions of its reception: but when the same
   breath of heaven hath been checked with the stiffness of a tower, or
   the united strength of wood, it grew mighty, and dwelt there, and made
   the highest branches stoop and make a smooth path for it on the top of
   all its glories. So is sickness, and so is the grace of God: when
   sickness hath made the difficulty, then God's grace hath made a
   triumph, and by doubling its power hath created new proportions of a
   reward; and then shows its biggest glory, [85] when it hath the
   greatest difficulty to master, the greatest weaknesses to support, the
   most busy temptations to contest with; for so God loves that his
   strength should be seen in our weakness and our danger. Happy is that
   state of life in which our services to God are the dearest and the most
   expensive. [86]

   5. Sickness hath some degrees of eligibility, at least by an
   after-choice; because to all persons which are within the possibilities
   and state of pardon it becomes a great instrument of pardon of sins.
   For as God seldom rewards here and hereafter too, so it is not very
   often that he punishes in both states. In great and final sins he doth
   so; but we find it expressed only in the case of the sin against the
   Holy Ghost. which shall never be forgiven in this world, nor in the
   world to come,' that is, it shall be punished in both worlds, and the
   infelicities of this world shall but usher in the intolerable
   calamities of the next. But this is in a case of extremity, and in sins
   of an unpardonable malice: in those lesser stages of death, which are
   deviations from the rule, and not a destruction and perfect antinomy to
   the whole institution, God very often smites with his rod of sickness
   that he may not for ever be slaying the soul with eternal death. I will
   visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges;
   nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor
   suffer my truth to fail.' And there is in the New Testament a
   delivering over to Satan, [87] and a consequent buffetting, for the
   mortification of the flesh indeed, but that the soul may be saved in
   the day of the Lord. And to some persons the utmost process of God's
   anger reaches but to a sharp sickness, or at most but to a temporal
   death; and then the little momentary anger is spent, and expires in
   rest and a quiet grave. Origen, St. Augustine, and Cassian say,
   concerning Ananias and Sapphira that they were slain with a sudden
   death, that by such a judgment their sin might be punished, and their
   guilt expiated, and their persons reserved for mercy in the day of
   judgment. And God cuts off many of his children from the land of the
   living; and yet, when they are numbered amongst the dead, he finds them
   in the book of life, written amongst those that shall live to him for
   ever. And thus it happened to many new Christians, in the church of
   Corinth, for their little indecencies and disorders in the
   circumstances of receiving the holy sacrament. St. Paul says, that many
   amongst them were sick, many were weak, and some were fallen asleep.'
   He expresses the divine anger against those persons in no louder
   accents; which is according to the style of the New Testament, where
   all the great transactions of duty and reproof are generally made upon
   the stock of heaven, and hell is plainly a reserve, and a period set to
   the declaration of God's wrath. For God knows that the torments of hell
   are so horrid, so insupportable a calamity, that he is not easy and apt
   to cast those souls which he hath taken so much care, and hath been at
   so much expense to save, into the eternal never-dying flames of hell
   lightly, for smaller sins, or after a fairly-begun repentance, and in
   the midst of holy desires to finish it; but God takes such penalties
   and exacts such fines of us which we may pay salvo contenemento, saving
   the main stake of all, even our precious souls. And therefore St.
   Augustine prayed to God in his penitential sorrows, "Here, O Lord, burn
   and cut my flesh, that thou mayest spare me for ever." For so said our
   blessed Saviour, every sacrifice must be burnt with fire;' that is, we
   must abide in the state of grace; and if we have committed sins we must
   expect to be put into the state of affliction; and yet the sacrifice
   will send up a right and untroubled cloud, and a sweet smell to join
   with the incense of the altar, where the eternal Priest offers a
   never-ceasing sacrifice. And now I have said a thing against which
   there can be no exceptions, and of which no just reason can make
   abatement. For when sickness, which is the condition of our nature, is
   called for with purposes of redemption; when we are sent to death to
   secure eternal life; when God strikes us that he may spare us - it
   shows that we have done things which he essentially hates; and
   therefore we must be smitten with the rod of God: but in the midst of
   judgment God remembers mercy, and makes the rod to be medicinal, and,
   like the rod of God in the hand of Aaron, to shoot forth buds and
   leaves and almonds, hopes and mercies and eternal recompenses, in the
   day of restitution. This is so great a good to us, if it be well
   conducted in all the channels of its intention and design, that if we
   had put off the objections of the flesh with abstractions, contempts,
   and separations, so as we ought to do, it were as earnestly to be
   prayed for as any gay blessing that crowns our cups with joy and our
   heads with garlands and forgetfulness. But this was it which I said,
   that this may, nay, that it ought to be chosen, at least by an
   after-election; for so said St. Paul, If we judge ourselves, we shall
   not be condemned of the Lord;' that is, if we judge ourselves worthy of
   the sickness, if we acknowledge and confess God's justice in smiting
   us, if we take the rod of God in the infliction; and then the sickness,
   beginning and being managed in the virtue of repentance and patience
   and resignation and charity, will end in peace and pardon and
   justification and consignation to glory. That I have spoken truth, I
   have brought God's Spirit speaking in Scripture for a witness. But, if
   this be true, there are not many states of life that have advantages
   which can outweigh this great instrument of security to our final
   condition. Moses died at the mouth of the Lord, said the story; he died
   with the kisses of the Lord's mouth: [88] (so the Chaldee paraphrase:)
   it was the greatest he kissed him and he died. But I have some things
   to observe for the better finishing this consideration.

   1. All these advantages and lessenings of evils in the state of
   sickness are only upon the stock of virtue and religion. There is
   nothing can make sickness in any sense eligible, or in many senses
   tolerable, but only the grace of God; [89] that only turns sickness
   into easiness and felicity which also turns it into virtue. For
   whosoever goes about to comfort a vicious person, when he lies sick
   upon his bed, can only discourse of the necessities of nature, of the
   unavoidableness of the suffering, of the accidental vexations and
   increase of torments by impatience, of the fellowship of all the sons
   of Adam, and such other little considerations; which indeed, if sadly
   reflected upon, and found to stand alone, teach him nothing but the
   degree of his calamity, and the evil of his condition, and teach him
   such a patience, and minister to him such a comfort, which an only make
   him to observe decent gestures in his sickness, and to converse with
   his friends and standers-by so as may do them comfort, and ease their
   funeral and civil complaints, but do him no true advantage; for all
   that may be spoken to a beast when he is crowned with hair-laces, and
   bound with fillets to the altar, to bleed to death to appease the anger
   of the Deity, and to ease the burden of his relatives. And indeed what
   comfort can he receive whose sickness as it looks back, is an effect of
   God's indignation and fierce vengeance, and if it goes forward and
   enters into the gates of the grave is the beginning of a sorrow that
   shall never have an ending? But when the sickness is a messenger sent
   from a chastising father; when it first turns into degrees of
   innocence, and then into virtues, and thence into pardon, this is no
   misery, but such a method of the divine economy and dispensation as
   resolves to bring us to heaven without any new impositions, but merely
   upon the stock and charges of nature.

   2. Let it be observed, that these advantages which spring from sickness
   are not in all instances of virtue, nor to all persons. Sickness is the
   proper scene for patience and resignation, for all the passive graces
   of a Christian, for faith and hope, and for some single acts of the
   love of God. But sickness is not a fit station for a penitent; and it
   can serve the ends of the grace of repentance but accidentally.
   Sickness may begin a repentance, [90] if God continues life, and if we
   co-operate with the divine grace; or sickness may help to alleviate the
   wrath of God, and to facilitate the pardon, if all the other parts of
   this duty be performed in our healthful state, so that it may serve at
   the entrance in or at the going out. But sickness, at no hand, is a
   good stage to represent all the substantial parts of this duty; 1. it
   invites to it; 2. it makes it appear necessary; 3. it takes off the
   fancies of vanity; 4. it attempters the spirit; 5. it cures hypocrisy;
   6. it tames the fumes of pride; 7. it is the school of patience; 8. and
   by taking us from off the brisker relishes of the world, it makes us
   with more gust to taste the things of the Spirit: and all this only
   when God fits the circumstances of the sickness so as to consist with
   acts of reason, consideration, choice, and a present and reflecting
   mind which then God sends, when he means that the sickness of the body
   should be the cure of the soul. But let no man so rely upon it as, by
   design to trust the beginning, the progress, and the consummation of
   our piety to such an estate, which for ever leaves it imperfect; and
   though to some persons it adds degrees, and ministers opportunities,
   and exercises single acts with great advantage, in passive graces; yet
   it is never an entire or sufficient instrument for the change of our
   condition from the state of death to the liberty and life of the sons
   of God.

   3. It were good, if we would transact the affairs of our souls with
   nobleness and ingenuity, and that we would, by an early and forward
   religion, prevent the necessary arts of the divine providence. It is
   true that God cures some by incision, by fire, and torments; but these
   are ever the more obstinate and more unrelentint natures. God's
   providence is not so afflictive and full of trouble, [91] as that it
   hath placed sickness and infirmity amongst things simply necessary;
   and, in most persons, it is but a sickly and an effeminate virtue,
   which is imprinted upon our spirits with fears, and the sorrows of a
   fever, or a peevish consumption. It is but a miserable remedy to be
   beholden to a sickness for our health; and though it be better to
   suffer the loss of a finger than that the arm and the whole body should
   putrefy, yet even then also it is a trouble and an evil to lose a
   finger. He that mends with sickness pares the nails of the beast when
   they have already torn off part of the flesh: but he that would have a
   sickness become a clear and an entire blessing, a thing indeed to be
   reckoned among the good things of God and the evil things of the world,
   must lead a holy life, and judge himself with an early sentence; and so
   order the affairs of his soul, that, in the usual method of God's
   saving us, there may be nothing left to be done, but that such virtues
   should be exercised which God intends to crown; and then, as when the
   Athenians upon a day of battle, with longing and uncertain souls
   sitting in their common-hall, expecting what would be the sentence of
   the day, at last received a messenger who only had breath enough left
   him to say, "We are conquerors," and so died, - so shall the sick
   person, who hath fought a good fight and kept the faith,' and only
   waits for his dissolution and his sentence, breathe forth his spirit
   with the accents of a conquer, and his sickness and his death shall
   only make the mercy and the virtue more illustrious.

   But for the sickness itself: if all the calumnies were true concerning
   it with which it is aspersed, yet it is far to be preferred before the
   most pleasant sin, and before a great secular business and a temporal
   care; and some men wake as much in the foldings of the softest beds, as
   others on the cross; and sometimes the very weight of sorrow and the
   weariness of a sickness press the spirit into slumbers and the images
   of rest, when the intemperate or the lustful person rolls upon his
   uneasy thorns, and sleep is departed from his eyes. Certain it is some
   sickness is a blessing. Indeed blindness were a most accursed thing,
   [92] if no man were ever blind but he whose eyes were pulled out with
   tortures or burning basins: and if sickness were always a testimony of
   God's anger, and a violence to a man's whose condition, then it were a
   huge calamity; but because God sends it to his servants, to his
   children, to little infants, to apostles and saints, with designs of
   mercy to preserve their innocence, to overcome temptation, to try their
   virtue, to fit them for rewards: it is certain that sickness never is
   an evil but by our own faults, and if we will do our duty, we shall be
   sure to turn it into a blessing. If the sickness be great, it may end
   in death, and the greater it is [93] the sooner; and if it be very
   little, it hath great intervals of rest; if it be between both, we may
   be masters of it, and by serving the ends of Providence serve also the
   perfective end of human nature, and enter into the possession of
   everlasting mercies.

   The sum is this: He that is afraid of pain is afraid of his own nature;
   and if his fear be violent it is a sign his patience is none at all,
   and an impatient person is not ready-dressed for heaven. None but
   suffering, humble, and patient persons can go to heaven; and when God
   hath given us the whole stage of our life to exercise all the active
   virtues of religion, it is necessary in the state of virtues, that some
   portion and period of our lives be assigned to passive graces; for
   patience, for Christian fortitude, for resignation or conformity to the
   Divine will. But as the violent fear of sickness makes us impatient, so
   it will make our death without comfort and without religion; and we
   shall go off from our stage of actions and sufferings with an
   unhandsome exit, because we were willing to receive the kindness of
   God, when he expressed it as we listed; but we would not suffer him to
   be king and gracious to us in his own method, nor were willing to
   exercise and improve our virtues at the charge of a sharp fever, or a
   lingering consumption. Woe be to the man that hath lost patience; for
   what will he do when the Lord shall visit him?' [94]

  SECTION VII.

    The second Temptation proper to the state of Sickness, Fear of Death, with
    its Remedies.

   There is nothing which can make sickness unsanctified, but the same
   also will give us cause to fear death. if, therefore, we so order our
   affairs and spirits that we do not fear death, our sickness may easily
   become our advantage; and we can then receive counsel, and consider,
   and do those acts of virtue, which are, in that state, the proper
   services of God, and such which men in bondage and fear are not capable
   of doing, or of advices how they should, when they come to the
   appointed days of mourning. And, indeed, if men would but place their
   design of being happy in the nobleness, courage, and perfect
   resolutions of doing handsome things, and passing through our
   unavoidable necessities, in the contempt and despite of the things of
   this world, and in holy living and the perfective desires of our
   natures, the longings and pursuances after heaven; it is certain they
   could not be made miserable by chance and change, by sickness and
   death. But we are so softened and made effeminate with delicate
   thoughts, and meditations of ease, and brutish satisfactions that if
   our death come before we have seized upon a great fortune, or enjoy the
   promises of the fortune-tellers, we esteem ourselves to be robbed of
   our goods, to be mocked, and miserable. Hence it comes that men are
   impatient of the thoughts of death; hence come those arts of
   protraction and delaying the significations of old age: thinking to
   deceive the world, men cozen themselves, [95] and by representing
   themselves youthful, they certainly continue their vanity, till
   Proserpina pull the peruke from their heads. We cannot deceive God and
   nature; for a coffin is a coffin, though it be covered with a pompous
   veil; and the minutes of our time strike on, and are counted by angels,
   till the period comes which must cause the passing-bell to give warning
   to all the neighbours that thou art dead, and they must be so; and
   nothing can excuse or retard this. And if our death could be put off a
   little longer, what advantage can it be, in thy accounts of nature or
   felicity? They that three hundred years agone died unwillingly, and
   stopped death two days, or stayed it a week, what is their gain? Where
   is that week? And poor-spirited men use arts of protraction, and make
   their persons pitiable, but their condition contemptible, being like
   the poor sinners at Noah's flood; the waters drove them out of their
   lower rooms; then they crept up to the roof, having lasted half a day
   longer, and then they knew not how to get down; some crept upon the
   top-branch of a tree, and some climbed up to a mountain, and stayed, it
   may be, three days longer; but all that while they entered a worse
   torment than death: they lived with amazement, and were distracted with
   the ruins of mankind, and the horror of a universal deluge.

   Remedies against the Fear of Death, by way of Consideration.

   1. God having in this world placed us in a sea, and troubled the sea
   with a continual storm, hath appointed the church for a ship, and
   religion to be the stern; but there is no haven or port but death.
   Death is that harbour, whither God hath designed every one, that there
   he may find rest from the troubles of the world. How many of the
   noblest Romans have taken death for sanctuary, and have esteemed it
   less than shame or a mean dishonour? and Caesar was cruel to Domitius,
   captain of Corfinium, when he had taken the town from him, that he
   refused to sign his petition of death. Death would have hid his head
   with honour, but that cruel mercy reserved him to the shame of
   surviving his disgrace. [96] The holy Scripture, giving an account of
   the reason of the Divine providence taking godly men from this world,
   and shutting them up in a hasty grave, says, that they are taken away
   from the evils to come:' and concerning ourselves it is certain, if we
   had ten years agone taken seizure of our portion of dust, death had not
   taken us from good things, but from infinite evils, such which the sun
   hath seldom seen. Did not Priamus weep oftener that Troilus? [97] and
   happy had he been, if he had died when his sons were living, and his
   kingdom safe, and houses full, and his city unburnt. It was a long life
   that made him miserable, and an early death only could have secured his
   fortune. And it hath happened many times, that persons of a fair life
   and a clear reputation, of a good fortune, and an honourable name, have
   been tempted in their age to folly and vanity, [98] have fallen under
   the disgrace of dotage, or into an unfortunate marriage, or have
   besotted themselves with drinking, or outlived their fortunes, or
   become tedious to their friends, or are afflicted with lingering and
   vexatious diseases, or lived to see their excellent parts buried, and
   cannot understand the wise discourses and productions of their younger
   years. In all these cases, and infinite more, do not all the world say,
   that it had been better this man had died sooner? [99] But so have I
   known passionate women to shriek aloud when their nearest relatives
   were dying, and that horrid shriek hath stayed the spirit of the man
   awhile to wonder at the folly, and represent the inconvenience; and the
   dying person hath lived one day longer full of pain, amazed with an
   indeterminate spirit, distorted with convulsions, and only come again
   to act one scene more of a new calamity, and to die with less decency.
   So also do very many men; with passion and a troubled interest they
   strive to continue their life longer; and it may be, they escape this
   sickness, and live to fall into a disgrace; they escape the storm, and
   fall into the hands of pirates; and instead of dying with liberty, they
   live like slaves, miserable and despised servants to a little time, and
   sottish admirers of the breath of their own lungs. Paulus Emilius did
   handsomely reprove the cowardice of the king of humanity, that having
   conquered him and taken his kingdom from him, he would be content with
   that, and not lead him in triumph a prisoner to Rome. Emilius told him
   he need not be beholden to him for that; himself might prevent that in
   despite of him. But the timorous king durst not die. But certainly
   every wise man will easily believe, that it had been better the
   Macedonian kings should have died in battle than protract their life so
   long, till some of them came to be scriveners and joiners at Rome: or
   that the tyrant of Sicily better had perished in the Adriatic than to
   be wafted to Corinth safely, and there turn schoolmaster. It is a sad
   calamity, that the fear of death shall so imbecile man's courage and
   understanding, that he dares not suffer the remedy of all his
   calamities; but that he lives to say as Laberius did, "I have lived
   this one day longer than I should." Either, therefore, let us be
   willing to die, when God calls, or let us never more complain of the
   calamities of our life, which we feel so sharp and numerous. And when
   God sends his angel to us with the scroll of death, let us look on it
   as an act of mercy, to prevent many sins and many calamities of a
   longer life, and lay our heads down softly, and go to sleep without
   wrangling like babies and forward children. For a man (at least) get
   this by death, that his calamities are not immortal. [100]

   But I do not only consider death by the advantages of comparison; but
   if we look on it in itself, it is no such formidable thing, if we view
   it on both sides and handle it, and consider all its appendages.

   2. It is necessary, and therefore not intolerable: and nothing is to be
   esteemed evil which God and nature have fixed with eternal sanctions.
   [101] It is a law of God, it is a punishment of our sins, and it is the
   constitution of our nature. Two differing substances were joined
   together with the breath of God, and when that breath is taken away,
   they part asunder, and return to their several principles; the soul to
   God our Father, the body to the earth our mother: and what in all this
   is evil? Surely nothing, but that we are men; nothing, but that we are
   not born immortal: but by declining this change with great passion, or
   receiving it with a huge natural fear, we accuse the Divine Providence
   of tyranny, and exclaim against our natural constitution, and are
   discontent that we are men.

   3. It is a thing that is no great matter in itself; if we consider,
   that we die daily, that it meets us in every accident, that every
   creature carries a dart along with it and can kill us. And therefore
   when Lysimachus threatened Theodorus to kill him, he told him, that was
   so great matter to do, and he could do no more than the cantharides
   could: a little fly could do as much.

   4. It is a thing that every one suffers, even persons of the lowest
   resolution, of the meanest virtue, of no breeding, of no discourse.
   Take away but the pomps of death, the disguises and solemn bugbears,
   the tinsel, and the actings by candlelight, and proper and fantastic
   ceremonies, the minstrels and the noise makers, the women and the
   weepers, the swoonings and the shriekings, the nurses and the
   physicians, the dark room and the ministers, the kindred and the
   watchers; and then to die is easy, ready, and quitted from its
   troublesome circumstances. It is the same harmless thing that a poor
   shepherd suffered yesterday, or a maid-servant to-day; and at the same
   time in which you die, in that very night a thousand creatures die with
   you, some wise men, and many fools; and the wisdom of the first will
   not quit him, and the folly of the latter does not make him unable to
   die.

   5. Of all the evils of the world which are reproached with an evil
   character, death is the most innocent of its accusation. For when it is
   present, it hurts nobody, and when it is absent, it is indeed
   troublesome, but the trouble is owning to our fears, not to the
   affrighting and mistaken object: and besides this, if it were an evil,
   it is so transient that it passes like the instant or undiscerned
   portion of the present time; and either it is past, or it is not yet;
   for just when it is, no man hath reason to complain of so insensible,
   so sudden, so undiscerned a change.

   6. It is so harmless a thing that no good man was ever thought the more
   miserable for dying but much the happier. When men saw the graves of
   Calatinus, of the Servilii, the Scipios, the Metlli, did ever any man
   among the wisest Romans think them unhappy? And when St. Paul fell
   under the sword of Nero, and St. Peter died upon the cross, and St.
   Stephen from a heap of stones was carried into an easier grave, they
   that made great lamentation over them, wept for their own interest, and
   after the manner of men; but the martyrs were accounted happy, and
   their days kept solemnly, and their memories preserved in never-dying
   honours. When St. Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, in France, went into the
   East to reprove the Arian heresy, he heard that a young noble gentleman
   treated with his daughter Abra for marriage. The bishop wrote to his
   daughter, that she should not engage her promise, nor do countenance to
   that request, because he had provided for her a husband fair, rich,
   wise, and noble, far beyond her present offer. The event of which was
   this: she obeyed; and when her father returned from his eastern triumph
   to his western charge, he prayed to God that his daughter might die
   quickly: and God heard his prayers, and Christ took her into his bosom,
   entertaining with antepasts and caresses of holy love, till the day of
   the marriage-supper of the Lamb shall come. But when the bishop's wife
   observed this event, and understood of the good man her husband what
   was done, and why, she never let him alone, till he obtained the same
   favour for her; and she also, at the prayers of St. Hilary, went into a
   more early grave and a bed of joys.

   7. I is a sottish and an unlearned thing to reckon the time of our
   life, as it is short or long, to be good or evil fortune; life in
   itself being neither good nor bad, but just as we make it; and
   therefore so is death.

   8. But when we consider death is not only better than a miserable life,
   not only an easy and innocent thing in itself, but also that it is a
   state of advantage, we shall have reason not to double the sharpnesses
   of our sickness by our fear of death. Certain it is, death hath some
   good upon its proper stock; praise, and a fair memory, a reverence and
   religion towards them so great, that it is counted dishonest to speak
   evil of the dead; then they rest in peace and are quiet from their
   labours, and are designed to immortality. Cleobis and Biton, Trophonius
   and Agamedes, had an early death sent them as a reward; to the former,
   for their piety to their mother; to the latter, for building of a
   temple. To this all those arguments will minister, which relate the
   advantages of the state of separation and resurrection.

  SECTION VIII

    Remedies against fear of Death, by way of Exercise.

   1. He that would willingly be fearless of death, must learn to despise
   the world: he must neither love any thing passionately, nor be proud of
   any circumstance of his life. O death, how bitter is the remembrance of
   thee to a man that liveth at rest in his possessions, to a man that
   hath nothing to vex him, and that hath prosperity in all things; yea,
   unto him that is yet able to receive meat,' said the son of Sirach. But
   the parts of this exercise help each other. If a man be not
   incorporated in all his passions to the things of this world he will
   less fear to be divorced from them by a supervening death; and yet
   because he must part with them all in death; it is but reasonable he
   should not be passionate for so fugitive and transient interest. But if
   any man things well of himself for being a handsome person, or if he be
   stronger and wiser than his neighbours, he must remember that what he
   boasts of will decline into weakness and dishonour; but that very
   boasting and complacency will make death keener and more unwelcome,
   because it comes to take him from his confidence and pleasures, making
   his beauty equal to those ladies that have slept some years in
   charnel-houses, and their strength not so stubborn as the breath of an
   infant, and their wisdom such which can be looked for in the land where
   all things are forgotten.

   2. He that would not fear death must strengthen his spirits with the
   proper instruments of Christian fortitude. All men are resolved upon
   this, that to bear grief honestly and temperately, and to die willingly
   and nobly, is the duty of a good and valiant man; and they that are not
   so are vicious and fools and cowards. All men praise the valiant and
   honest; and that which the very heathen admired in their noblest
   examples is especially patience and contempt of death. Zeno Eleates
   endured torments rather than discover his friends, or betray them to
   the danger of the tyrant; and Calanus, the barbarous and unlearned
   Indian, willingly suffered himself to be burnt alive; and all the women
   did so, to do honour to their husbands funeral, and to represent and
   prove their affections great to their lords. The religion of a
   Christian does more command fortitude than ever did any institution;
   for we are commanded to be willing to die for Christ, to die for the
   brethren, to die rather than to give offence or scandal: the effect of
   which is this, that he that is instructed to do the necessary parts of
   his duty, is, by the same instrument, fortified against death; as he
   that does his duty need not fear death, so neither shall he; the parts
   of his duty are parts of his security. It is certainly a great baseness
   and pusillanimity of spirit that makes death terrible, and extremely to
   be avoided.

   3. Christian prudence is a great security against the fear of death.
   For if we be afraid of death, it is but reasonable to use all spiritual
   arts to take off the apprehension of the evil; but therefore we ought
   to remove our fear, because fear gives to death wings and spurs and
   darts. Death hastens to a fearful man; if therefore you would make
   death harmless and slow, to throw off fear is the way to do it; and
   prayer is the way to do that. If therefore you be afraid of death,
   consider you will have less need to fear it by how much the less you do
   fear it: and so cure your direct fear by a reflex act of prudence and
   consideration. Fannius had not died so soon [102] if he had not feared
   death; and when Cneius Carbo begged the respite of a little time, for a
   base employment, of the soldiers of Pompey, he got nothing, but that
   the baseness of his fear dishonoured the dignity of his third
   consulship; and he chose to die in a place where none but his meanest
   servants should have seen him. I remember a story of the wrestler
   Polydamus, that, running into a cave to avoid the storm, the water at
   last swelled so high that it began to press that hollowness to a ruin;
   which when his fellows espied, they chose to enter into the common fate
   of all men, and went abroad; but Polydamus thought by his strength to
   support the earth, till its intolerable weight crushed him into
   flatness and a grave. Many men run for shelter to a place, and they
   only find a remedy for their fears by feeling the worst of evils; fear
   itself finds no sanctuary but the worst of sufferance; and they that
   fly from a battle are exposed to the mercy and fury of the pursuers,
   who, if they faced about, were as well disposed to give laws of life
   and death as to take them, and at worst can but die nobly; but now,
   even at the very best, they live shamefully, or die timorously. Courage
   is the greatest security; for it does most commonly safeguard the man,
   but always rescues the condition from an intolerable evil.

   4. If thou wilt be fearless of death endeavour to be in love with the
   felicities of saints and angels, and be once persuaded to believe that
   there is a condition of living better than this; that there are
   creatures more noble than we; that above there is a country better than
   ours; that the inhabitants know more and know better, and are in places
   of rest and desire; and first learn to value it, and then learn to
   purchase it, and death cannot be a formidable thing, which lets us into
   so much joy and so much felicity. And, indeed, who would not thing his
   condition mended if he passed from conversing with dull tyrants and
   enemies of learning, to converse with Homer and Plato, with Socrates
   and Cicero, with Plutarch and Fabricius? So the heathens speculated,
   but we consider higher. The dead that die in the Lord' shall converse
   with St. Paul, and all the college of the apostles, and all the saints
   and martyrs, with all the good men whose memory we preserve in honour,
   with excellent kings and holy bishops, and with the great Shepherd and
   Bishop of our souls, Jesus Christ, and with God himself. For Christ
   died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we might live together
   with him. Then we shall be free from lust and envy, [103] from fear and
   rage, from covetousness and sorrow, from tears and cowardice; and
   these, indeed, properly, are the only evils that are contrary to
   felicity and wisdom. Then we shall see strange things, and know new
   propositions, and all things in another manner and to higher purposes.
   Cleombrotus was so taken with this speculation, that, having learned
   from Plato's Phaedon the soul's abode, he had not patience to stay
   nature's dull leisure, but leaped from a wall to his portion of
   immortality. And when Pomponius Atticus resolved to die by famine, to
   ease the great pains of his gout, in the alistnence of two days be
   found his foot at ease; but when he began to feel the pleasures of an
   approaching death, and the delicacies of that ease he was to inherit
   below, he would not withdraw his foot, but went on and finished his
   death; and so did Cleapthes. And every wise man will despise the little
   evils of that state, which indeed is the daughter of fear, but the
   mother of rest and peace and felicity.

   5. If God should say to us, Cast thyself into the sea, (as Christ did
   to St. Peter, or as God concerning Jonas,) I have provided for thee a
   dolphin or a whale, or a port, a safety or a deliverance, security or a
   reward, were we not incredulour and pusillanimous persons if we should
   tremble to put such a felicity into act, and ourselves into possession?
   The very duty of resignation and the love of our own interest are good
   antidotes against fear. In forty or fifty years we find evils enough,
   and arguments enough, to make us weary of this life; and to a good man
   there are very many more reasons to be afraid of life than death, this
   having in it less of evil and more of advantage. And it was a rare wish
   of that Roman, [104] that death might come only to wise and excellent
   persons, and not to fools and cowards; that it might not be a sanctuary
   for the timorous, but the reward of the virtuous: and indeed they only
   can make advantage of it.

   6. Make no excuses to make thy desires of life seem reasonable; neither
   cover thy fear with pretences, but suppose it rather with arts of
   severity and ingenuity. Some are not willing to submit to God's
   sentence and arrest of death till they have finished such a design,
   [105] or made an end of the last paragraph of their book, or raised
   such portions for their children, or preached so many sermons, or built
   their house, or planted their orchard, or ordered their estate with
   such advantages. It is well for the modesty of these men that the
   excuse is ready; but if it were not, it is certain they would search
   one out: for an idle man is never ready to die, and is glad of any
   excuse; and a busied man hath always something unfinished, and he is
   ready for every thing but death. And I remember that Petronius brings
   in Eumolpus composing verses in a desperate storm, and being called
   upon to shift for himself when the ship dashed upon the rock, cried out
   to let him alone till he had trimmed and finished his verse, which was
   lame in the hinder led: the man either had too strong a desire to end
   his verse, or too great a desire not to end his life. But we must know,
   God's times are not to be measured by our circumstances; and what I
   value, God regards not; or if it be valuable in the accounts of men,
   yet God will supply it with other contingencies of his providence; and
   if Epaphroditus had died when he had his great sickness St. Paul speaks
   of, God would have secured the work of the gospel without him: and he
   could have spared Epaphroditus as well as St. Stephen, and St. Peter as
   well as St. James. Say no more; but when God calls, lay aside thy
   papers; and first dress thy soul, and then dress thy hearse.

   Blindness is odious, and widowhood is sad, and destitution is without
   comfort, and persecution is full of trouble, and famine is intolerable,
   and tears are the sad ease of a sadder heart; but these are evils of
   our life, not of our death. For the dead that die in the Lord are so
   far from wanting the commodities of this life, that they do not want
   life itself.

   After all this, I do not say it is a sin to be afraid of death: we find
   the boldest spirit that discourses of it with confidence, and dares
   undertake a danger as big as death, yet doth shrink at the horror of it
   when it comes dressed in its proper circumstances. And Brutus, who was
   as bold a Roman to undertake a noble action as any was since they first
   reckoned by consuls, yet when Furius came to cut his throat, after his
   defeat by Anthony, he ran from it like a girl, and being admonished to
   die constantly, he swore by his life that he would shortly endure
   death. But what do I speak of such imperfect persons? Our blessed Lord
   was pleased to legitimate fear to us by his agony and prayers in the
   garden. It is not a sin to be afraid, but it is a great felicity to be
   with fear; which felicity our dearest Saviour refused to have, because
   it was agreeable to his purposes to suffer anything that was contrary
   to felicity, every thing but sin. But when men will by all means avoid
   death, they are like those who at any hand resolve to be rich. The case
   may happen in which they will blaspheme and dishonour Providence, or do
   a base action, or curse God and die; but, in all cases, they die
   miserable and ensnared, and in no case do they die the less for it.
   Nature hath left us the key of the churchyard, and custom hath brought
   cemeteries and charnel-houses into cities and churches, places most
   frequented, that we might not carry ourselves strangely in so certain,
   so expected, so ordinary, so unavoidable an accident. All reluctancy or
   unwillingness to obey the divine decree is but a snare to ourselves,
   and a load to our spirits, and is either an entire cause or a great
   aggravation of the calamity. Who did not scorn to look upon Xerxes when
   he caused three hundred stripes to be given to the sea, and sent a
   chartel of defiance against the mountain of Athos? We did not scorn the
   proud vanity of Cyrus, when he took so goodly a revenge upon the river
   Cyndus for his hard passage over it? or did not deride or pity the
   Thracians for shooting arrows against heaven when it thunders? To be
   angry with God, to quarrel with the divine providence, by repining
   against an unalterable, a natural, an easy sentence, is an argument of
   a huge folly, and the parent of a great trouble; a man is base and
   foolish to no purpose; he throws away a vice to his own misery, and to
   no advantages of ease and pleasure. Fear keeps men in bondage all their
   life, saith St. Paul; and patience makes him his own man, and lord of
   his own interest and person. Therefore posses yourselves in patience
   with reason and religion, and you shall die with ease. [106]

   If all the parts of this discourse be true, if they be better than
   dreams, and unless virtue be nothing but words, as a grove is a heap of
   trees; if they be not the phantasms of hypochondriacal persons, and
   designs upon the interest of men, and their persuasions to evil
   purposes; then there is no reason but that we should really desire
   death, and account it among the good things of God, and the sour and
   laborious felicities of man. St. Paul understood it well when he
   desired to be dissolved: he well enough knew his own advantages and
   pursued them accordingly. But it is certain that he that is afraid of
   death, I mean with a violent and transporting fear, with a fear apt to
   discompose his duty or his patience, that man either loves this world
   too much or dares not trust God for the next.

  SECTION IX.

    General Rules and Exercises whereby our Sickness may become safe and
    sanctified.

   1. Take care that the cause of thy sickness be such as may not sour it
   in the principal causes of it. It is a sad calamity to pass into the
   house of mourning through the gates of intemperance, by a drunken
   meeting, or the surfeits of a loathed and luxurious table; for then a
   man suffers the pain of his own folly, and he is like a fool smarting
   under the whip which his own viciousness twisted for his back: then a
   man pays the price of his sin, and hath a pure and an unmingled sorrow
   in his suffering; and it cannot be alleviated by any circumstances, for
   the whole affair is mere process of death and sorrow. Sin is in the
   head, sickness is in the body, and death and eternity of pains in the
   tail; and nothing can make this condition tolerable unless the miracles
   of the divine mercy will be pleased to exchange the eternal anger for
   the temporal. True it is, that in all sufferings the cause of it makes
   it noble or ignoble, honour or shame, tolerable or intolerable. For
   when patience is assaulted by a ruder violence, by a blow from heaven
   or earth, from a gracious God or an unjust man, patience looks forth to
   the doors, which way she may escape. And if innocence or a cause of
   religion keep the first entrance, then, whether she escapes at the
   gates of life or death, there is a good to be received greater than the
   evils of a sickness; but if sin thrust in that sickness, and that hell
   stands at the door, then patience turns into fury, and, seeing it
   impossible to go forth with safety, rolls up and down with a circular
   and infinite revolution, makes its motion not from but upon its own
   centre; it doubles the pain, and increases the sorrow, till by its
   weight it breaks the spirit and bursts into the agonies of infinite and
   eternal ages. If we had seen St. Polycarp burning to death, or St.
   Laurence roasted upon his gridiron, or St. Ignatius exposed to lions,
   or St. Sebastian pierced with arrows, or St. Attalus carried about the
   theatre with scorn unto his death, for the cause of Jesus, for
   religion, for God, and a holy conscience - we should have been in love
   with flames, and have thought the gridiron fairer than the spondae, the
   ribs of a martial bed; and we should have chosen to converse with those
   beasts, rather than those men that brought those beasts forth; and
   estimated the arrows to be rays of light brighter than the moon; and
   that disgrace and mistaken pageantry were a solemnity richer and more
   magnificent than Mordecia's procession upon the king's horse, and in
   the robes of majesty: for so did these holy men account them; they
   kissed their stakes, and hugged their deaths, and ran violently to
   torments, and counted whippings and secular disgraces to be the enamel
   of their persons, and the ointment of their heads, and the embalming
   their names, and securing them for immortality. But to see Sejanus torn
   in pieces by the people, or Nero crying or creeping timorously to his
   death, when he was condemned to die more majorum; to see Judas pale and
   trembling, full of anguish, sorrow, and despair; to observe the
   groanings and intolerable agonies of Herod and Antiochus - will tell
   and demonstrate the causes of patience and impatience to proceed from
   the causes of the suffering; and it is sin only that makes the cup
   bitter and deadly. When men, by vomiting, measure up the drink they
   took in, and sick and sad do again taste their meat turned into choler
   by intemperance, the sin and its punishment are mingled so that shame
   covers the face and sorrow puts a veil of darkness upon the heart; and
   we scarce pity a vile person that is haled to execution for murder or
   for treason, but we say he deserves it, and that every man is concerned
   in it that he should die. If lust brought the sickness or the shame, if
   we truly suffer the rewards of our evil deeds, we must thank ourselves;
   that is, we are fallen into an evil condition, and are the sacrifice of
   the divine justice. But if we live holy lives, and if we enter well in,
   we are sure to pass on safe, and to go forth with advantage if we list
   ourselves.

   2. To this relates that we should not counterfeit sickness; for he that
   is to be careful of his passage into a sickness will think himself
   concerned that he fall not into it through a trap-door: for so it hath
   sometimes happened that such counterfeiting to light and evil purposes
   hath ended in a real sufferance. Appian tells of a Roman gentleman who,
   to escape the proscription of the trinmvirate, fled, and to secure his
   privacy, counterfeited himself blind on one eye, and wore a plaister
   upon it; till, beginning to be free from the malice of the three
   prevailing princes, he opened his hood, but could not open his eye, but
   for ever lost the use of it, and with his eye paid for his liberty and
   hypocrisy. And Caelius counterfeited the gout, and all its
   circumstances and pains, its dressings and arts of remedy and
   complaint, till at last the gout really entered and spoiled the
   pageantry. His arts of dissimulation were so witty, that they put life
   and motion into the very image of the disease: he made the very picture
   to sigh and groan.

   It is easy to tell upon the interest of what virtue such counterfeiting
   is to be reproved. But it will be harder to snatch the politics of the
   world from following that which they call a canonised and authentic
   precedent; and David's counterfeiting himself mad before the king of
   Gath, to save his life and liberty, will be sufficient to entice men to
   serve an end upon the stock and charges of so small an irregularity,
   not in the matter of manners, but in the rules and decencies of natural
   or civil deportment: I cannot certainly tell what degrees of excuse
   David's action might put on. This only; besides his present necessity,
   the laws whose coercive and directive power David lived under had less
   of severity, and more of liberty, and towards enemies had so little of
   restraint and so great a power, that what amongst them was a direct
   sin, if used to their brethren the sons of Jacob, was lawful and
   permitted to be acted against enemies. To which also I add this general
   caution, that the actions of holy persons in Scripture are not always
   good precedents to us Christians, who are to walk by a rule and a
   greater strictness, with more simplicity and heartiness of pursuit. And
   amongst them sanctity and holy living did, in very many of its
   instances, increase in new particulars of duty; and the prophets
   reproved many things which the law forbad not, and taught many duties
   which Moses prescribed not; and as the time of Christ's approach came,
   so the sermons and revelations too were more evangelical and like the
   patterns which were fully to be exhibited by the Son of God. Amongst
   which it is certain that Christian simplicity and godly sincerity are
   to be accounted; and counterfeiting of sickness is a huge enemy to
   this: it is an upbraiding the Divine Providence, a jesting with fire, a
   playing with a thunderbolt, a making the decrees of God to serve the
   vicious or secular ends of men; it is a tempting of a judgment, a false
   accusation of God, a forestalling and antedating his anger; it is a
   cozening of men by making God a party in the fraud; and, therefore, if
   the cozenage returns upon the man's own head, he enters like a fox into
   his sickness, and perceives himself catched in a trap, or earthed in
   the intolerable dangers of the grave.

   3. Although we must be infinitely careful to prevent it, that sin does
   not thrust us into a sickness; yet, when we are in the house of sorrow,
   we should do well to take physic against sin, and suppose that it is
   the cause of the evil; if not by way of natural causality and proper
   effect, yet by amoral influence, and by a just demerit. We can easily
   see when a man hath got a surfeit; intemperance is as plain as the
   handwriting upon the wall, and easier to be read; but covetousness may
   cause a fever as well as drunkenness, and pride can produce a
   falling-sickness as well as long washings and dilutions of the brain,
   and intemperate lust; and we find it recorded in Scripture that the
   contemptuous and unprepared manner of receiving the holy sacraments
   caused sickness and death; and sacrilege and vow-breach in Ananias and
   Sapphira made them to descend quick into their graves. Therefore, when
   sickness is upon us, let us cast about; and, if we can, let us find out
   the cause of God's displeasure; that, it being removed, we may return
   into the health and securities of God's loving-kindness. Thus, in the
   three years' famine, David inquired of the Lord what was the matter:
   and God answered, It is for Saul and his bloody house;' and then David
   expiated the guilt, and the people were full again of food and
   blessing. And when Israel was smitten by the Amorites, Joshua cast
   about, and found out the accursed thing, and cast it out; and the
   people after that fought prosperously. And what God in that case said
   to Joshua he will also verify to us: I will not be with you any more,
   unless you destroy the accursed thing from among you.' [107] But in
   pursuant of this we are to observe, that although in case of loud and
   clamorous sins the discovery is easy, and the remedy not difficult;
   yet, because Christianity is a nice thing, and religion is as pure as
   the sun, and the soul of man is apt to be troubled from more principles
   than the intricate and curiously-composed body in its innumerable
   parts, it will often happen that iffy go to inquire into the particular
   we shall never find it out; and we may suspect drunkenness when it may
   be also a morose delectation in unclean thoughts, or covetousness, or
   oppression, or a crafty invasion of my neighbour's rights, or my want
   of charity, or my judging unjustly in my own cause, or my censuring my
   neighbours, or a secret pride, or a base hypocrisy, or the pursuance of
   little ends with violence and passion, that may have procured the
   present messenger of death. Therefore, ask no more after any one, but
   heartily endeavour to reform all: Sin no more, lest a worst thing
   happen;' for a single search or accusation may be the design of an
   imperfect repentance; but no man does heartily return to God but he
   that decrees against every irregularity; and then only we can be
   restored to health or life, when we have taken away the causes of
   sickness and a cursed death.

   4. He that means to have his sickness turn into safety and life, into
   health and virtue, must make religion the employment of his sickness,
   and prayer the employment of his religion. For there are certain
   compendiums or abbreviatures and shortenings of religion fitted to
   several states. They that first gave up their names to Christ, and that
   turned from Paganism to Christianity, had an abbreviature fitted for
   them; they were to renounce their false worshippings, and give up their
   belief, and vow their obedience unto Christ; and in the very profession
   of this they were forgiven in baptism. For God hastens to snatch them
   from the power of the devil, and therefore shortens the passage and
   secures the estate. In the case of poverty, God hath reduced this duty
   of man to an abbreviature of those few graces which they can exercise;
   such as are patience, contentedness, truth, and diligence; and the rest
   he accepts in good will, and the charities of the soul, in prayers, and
   the actions of a cheap religion. And to most men charity is also an
   abbreviature. And as the love of God shortens the way to the purchase
   of all virtues; so the expression of this to the poor goes a huge way
   in the requisites and towards the consummation of an excellent
   religion. And martyrdom is another abbreviature; and so is every act of
   an excellent and heroical virtue. But when we are fallen into the state
   of sickness, and that our understanding is weak and troubled, our
   bodies sick and useless, our passions turned into fear, and the whole
   state into suffering, God, in compliance with man's infirmity, hath
   also turned our religion into such a duty which a sick man can do most
   passionately, and a sad man and a timorous can perform effectually, and
   a dying man can do to many purposes of pardon and mercy; and that is
   prayer. For although a sick man is bound to do many acts of virtue of
   several kinds, yet the most of them are to be done in the way of
   prayer. Prayer is not only the religion that is proper to a sick man's
   condition, but it is the manner of doing other graces, which is then
   left and in his power. For thus the sick man is to do his repentance
   and his mortifications, his temperance and his chastity, by a fiction
   of imagination, bringing the offers of the virtue to the spirit, and
   making an action of election: and so our prayers are a direct act of
   chastity, when they are made in the matter of that grace; just as
   repentance for our cruelty is an act of the grace of mercy; and
   repentance for uncleanness is an act of chastity, is a means of its
   purchase, an act in order to the habit. And though such acts of virtue,
   which are only in the way of prayer, are ineffective to the entire
   purchase, and of themselves cannot change the vice into virtue, yet
   they are good renewings of the grace, and proper exercise of a habit
   already gotten.

   The purpose of this discourse is, to represent the excellency of
   prayer, and its proper advantages which it hath in the time of
   sickness. For besides that it moves God to pity, piercing the clouds,
   and making the heavens, like a pricked eye, to weep over us and refresh
   us with showers of pity; it also doth the work of the soul, and
   expresses the virtue of his whole life in effigy, in pictures and
   lively representments, so preparing it for a never-ceasing crown, by
   renewing the actions in the continuation of a never-ceasing, a
   never-hindered affection. Prayer speaks to God when the tongue is
   stiffened with the approachings of death: prayer can dwell in the
   heart, and be signified by the hand or eye, by a thought or a groan;
   prayer of all the actions of religion is the last alive, and it serves
   God without circumstances, and exercises material graces by abstraction
   from matter, and separation, and makes them to be spiritual; and
   therefore best dresses our bodies for funeral or recovery, for the
   mercies of restitution or the mercies of the grave.

   5. In every sickness, whether it will or will not be so in nature and
   in the event, yet in thy spirit and preparations resolve upon it, and
   treat thyself accordingly, as if it were a sickness unto death. For
   many men support their unequal courages by flattery and false hopes;
   and because sicker men have recovered, believe that they shall do so;
   but therefore they neglect to adorn their souls, or set their house in
   order: besides the temporal inconveniences that often happen by such
   persuasions and putting off the evil day, such as are dying intestate,
   leaving estates entangled and some relatives unprovided for, they
   suffer infinitely in the interest and affairs of their soul, they die
   carelessly and surprised, their burdens on and their scruples
   unremoved, and their cases of conscience not determined, and, like a
   sheep without any care taken concerning their precious souls. Some men
   will never believe that a villain will betray them, though they receive
   often advices from suspicious persons and likely accidents, till they
   are entered into the snare; and then they cannot return; but so the
   treason entered, and the man was betrayed by his own folly, placing the
   snare in the regions and advantages of opportunity. This evil looks
   like boldness and a confident spirit, but it is the greatest
   timorousness and cowardice in the world. They are so fearful to die,
   that they dare not look upon it as possible; and think that the making
   of a will is a mortal sign, and sending for a spiritual man an
   irrecoverable disease: and they are so afraid lest they should think
   and believe now they must die, that they will not take care that it may
   not be evil in case they should. So did the eastern slaves drink wine,
   and wrapped their heads in a veil, that they might die without sense or
   sorrow, and wink hard that they might sleep the easier. In pursuance of
   this rune, let a man consider that whatsoever must be done in sickness
   ought to be done in health; only let him observe, that his sickness, as
   a good monitor, chastises his neglect of duty, and forces him to live
   as he always should; and then all these solemnities and dressings for
   death are nothing else but the part of a religious life, which he ought
   to have exercised all his days; and if those circumstances can affright
   him, let him please his fancy by this truth, that then he does but
   begin to live. But it will be a huge folly if he shall think that
   confession of his sins will kill him; or receiving the holy sacrament
   will hasten his agony, or the priest shall undo all the hopeful
   language and promises of his physician. Assure thyself thou canst not
   die the sooner; but by such addresses thou mayest die much the better.

   6. Let the sick person be infinitely careful that he do not fall into a
   state of death upon a new account: that is, at no hand commit a
   deliberate sin, or retain any affection to the old; for in both cases
   he falls into the evils of a surprise, and the horrors of a sudden
   death; for a sudden death is but a sudden joy, if it takes a man in the
   state and exercises of virtue; and it is only then an evil when it
   finds a man unready. They were sad departures when Tigillinus,
   Cornellius Gallus the pretor, Lewis the son of Gonzaga duke of Mantua,
   Ladislaus king of Naples, Speusippus, Giachetius of Geneva, and one of
   the popes, died in the forbidden embraces of abused women; or if Job
   had cursed God, and so died; or when a man sits down in despair, and in
   the accusation and calumny of the Divine mercy: they make their night
   sad, and stormy, and eternal. When Herod began to sink with the
   shameful torment of his bowels, and felt the grave open under him, he
   imprisoned the nobles of his kingdom, and commanded his sister that
   they should be a sacrifice to his departing ghost. This was an egress
   fit only for such persons who meant to dwell with devils to eternal
   ages; and that man is hugely in love with sin who cannot forbear in the
   week of the assizes, and when himself stood at the bar of scrutiny, and
   prepared for his final, never-to-be-reversed sentence. He dies suddenly
   to the worse sense and event of sudden death who so manages his
   sickness that even that state shall not be innocent, but that he is
   surprised in the guilt of a new account. It is a sign of a reprobate
   spirit, and an habitual prevailing ruling sin, which exacts obedience
   when the judgment looks him in the face. At least go to God with the
   innocence and fair deportment of thy person in the last scene of thy
   life, that when thy soul breaks into the state of separation, it may
   carry the relishes of religion and sobriety to the places of its abode
   and sentence. [108]

   7. When these things are taken care for, let the sick man so order his
   affairs that he have but very little conversation with the world, but
   wholly (as he can) attend to religion, and antedate his conversation,
   in heaven, always having intercourse with God, and still conversing
   with the holy Jesus, kissing his wounds, admiring his goodness, begging
   his mercy, feeding on him with faith, and drinking his blood: to which
   purpose it were very fit (if all circumstances be answerable) that the
   narrative of the passion of Christ be read or discoursed to him at
   length, or in brief, according to the style of the four gospels. But in
   all things let his care and society be as little secular as is
   possible.

CHAPTER IV.

OF THE PRACTICE OF THE GRACES PROPER TO THE STATE OF SICKNESS, WHICH A SICK MAN
MAY PRACTICE ALONE.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I.

    Of the Practice of Patience.

   Now we suppose the man entering upon his scene of sorrows and passive
   graces. It may be he went yesterday to a wedding, merry and brisk, and
   there he felt his sentence that he must return home and die; (for men
   very commonly enter into the snare singing, and consider not whither
   their fate leads them;) nor feared that then the angel was to strike
   his stroke, till his knees kissed the earth and his head trembled with
   the weight of the rod which God put into the hand of an exter minating
   angel. But whatsoever the ingress was, when the man feels his blood
   boil, or his bones weary, or his flesh diseased with a load of
   dispersed and disordered humour, or his head to ache, or his faculties
   discomposed, then he must consider that all those discoursed he hath
   heard concerning patience and resignation, and conformity to Christ's
   sufferings, and the melancholy lectures of the cross, must all of them
   now be reduced to practice, and pass from an ineffective contemplation
   to such an exercise as will really try whether we were true disciples
   of the cross, or only believed the doctrines of religion when we were
   at ease, and that they never passed through the ear to the heart, and
   dwelt not in our spirits. But every man should consider God does
   nothing in vain; that he would not to no purpose send us preachers and
   give us rules, and furnish us with discourse, and lend us books, and
   provide sermons, and make examples, and promise his Spirit, and
   describe the blessedness of holy sufferings, and prepare us with daily
   alarms, if he did not really purpose to order our affairs so that we
   should need all this, and use it all. There were no such thing as the
   grace of patience if we were not to feel a sickness or enter into a
   state of sufferings; whither, when we are entered, we are to practise
   by the following rules:

   The Practice and Acts of Patience by way of Rule.

   1. At the first address and presence of sickness stand still and arrest
   thy spirit, that it may, without amazement or affright, consider that
   this was that thou lookedst for and wert always certain should happen;
   and that now thou art to enter into the actions of a new religion, the
   agony of a strange constitution; but at no hand suffer thy spirits to
   be dispersed with fear, or wildness of thought, but stay their
   looseness and dispersion by a serious consideration of the present and
   future employment. For so doth the Libyan lion, spying the fierce
   huntsman, first beats himself with the strokes of his tail, and curls
   up his spirits, making them strong with union and recollection, till
   being struck with a Mauitanian spear, he rushed forth into his defence
   and noblest contention; and either scapes into the secrets of his own
   dwelling, or else dies the bravest of the forest. Every man, when shot
   with an arrow from God's quiver, must then draw in all the auxiliaries
   of reason, and know that then is the time to try his strength, and to
   reduce the words of his religion into action, and consider that, if he
   behaves himself weakly and timorously, he suffers nevertheless of
   sickness; but if he returns to health, he carries along with him the
   mark of a coward and a fool; and if he descends into his grave, he
   enters into the state of the faithless and unbelievers. Let him set his
   heart firm upon this resolution: "I must bear it inevitably, and I
   will, by God's grace, do it nobly."

   2. Bear in thy sickness all along the same thoughts, propositions, and
   discourses, concerning thy person, thy life and death, thy soul and
   religion, which thou hadst in the best days of thy health, and when
   thou didst discourse wisely concerning things spiritual. For it is to
   be supposed (and if it be not yet done, let this rule remind thee of
   it, and direct thee) that thou hast cast about in thy health, and
   considered concerning thy change and the evil day, that thou must be
   sick and die, that thou must need a comforter, and that it was certain
   thou shouldst fall into a state in which all the cords of thy anchor
   should be stretched, and the very rock and foundation of faith should
   be attempted; and whatsoever fancies may disturb you, or whatsoever
   weaknesses may invade you, yet consider when you were better able to
   judge and govern the accidents of your life you concluded it necessary
   to trust in God and posses your souls with patience. Think of things as
   they think that stand by you, and as you did when you stood by others;
   that it is a blessed thing to be patient; that a quietness of spirit
   hath a certain reward; that still there is infinite truth and reality
   in the promises of the gospel; that still thou art in the care of God,
   in the condition of a son, and working out thy salvation with labour
   and pain, with fear and trembling; that now the sun is under a cloud,
   but it still sends forth the same influence: and be sure to make no new
   principles upon the stock of a quick and an impatient sense or too busy
   an apprehension: keep your old principles, and upon their stock
   discourse and practise on towards your conclusion.

   3. Resolve to bear your sickness like a child, that is, without
   considering the evils and the pains, the sorrows and the danger; but go
   straight forward, and let thy thoughts cast about for nothing but how
   to make advantages of it by the instrument of religion. He that from a
   high tower looks down upon the precipice, and measures the space
   through which he must descend, and considers what a huge fall he shall
   have, shall feel more by the horrow of it than by the last dash on the
   pavement: and he that tells his groans and numbers his sighs, and
   reckons one for every gripe of his belly or throb of his distempered
   pulse, will make an artificial sickness greater than the natural. And
   if thou beest ashamed that a child should bear an evil better than
   thou, then take his instrument and allay thy spirit with it; reflect
   not upon thy evil, but contrive as much as you can for duty, and in all
   the rest inconsideration will ease your pain.

   4. If thou fearest thou shalt need, observe and draw together all such
   things as are apt to charm thy spirit and ease thy fancy in the
   sufferance. It is the counsel of Socrates: "It is (said he) a great
   danger, and you must, by discourse and arts of reasoning, enchant it
   into slumber and some rest." [109] It may be, thou wert moved much to
   see a person of honour to die untimely; or thou didst love the religion
   of that death-bed, and it was dressed up in circumstances fitted to thy
   needs, and hit thee on that part where thou wert most sensible; or some
   little saying in a sermon or passage of a book was chosen and singled
   out by a peculiar apprehension, and made consent lodge awhile in thy
   spirit, even then when thou didst place death in thy meditation, and
   didst view it in all its dress of fancy. Whatsoever that was which at
   any time did please thee in thy most passionate and fantastic part, let
   not that go, but bring it home at that time especially; because, when
   thou art in thy weakness, such little things will easier move thee than
   a more severe discourse and a better reason. For a sick man is like a
   scrupulous: his case is gone beyond the cure of arguments, and it is a
   trouble that can only be helped by chance, or a lucky saying: and
   Ludovico Corbinelli was moved at the death of Henry the Second more
   than if he had read the saddest elegy of all the unfortunate princes in
   Christendom, or all the sad sayings of Scripture, or the thrones of the
   funeral prophets. I deny not but this course is most proper to weak
   persons; but it is a state of weakness for which we are now providing
   remedies and instruction; a strong man will not need it; but when our
   sickness hath rendered us weak in all senses, it is not good to refuse
   a remedy because it supposes us to be sick. But then, if to the
   catalogue of weak persons we add all those who are ruled by fancy, we
   shall find that many persons in their health, and more in their
   sickness, are under the dominion of fancy, and apt to be helped by
   those little things which themselves have found fitted to their
   apprehension, and which no other man can minister to their needs,
   unless by chance, or in a heap of other things. But therefore every man
   should remember by what instruments he was at any time much moved, and
   try them upon his spirit in the day of his calamity.

   5. Do not choose the kind of thy sickness, or the manner of thy death,
   but let it be what God please, so it be no greater than thy spirit or
   thy patience; and for that you are to rely upon the promise of God, and
   to secure thyself by prayer and industry; but in all things else let
   God be thy chooser, and let it be thy work to submit indifferently and
   attend thy duty. It is lawful to beg of God that thy sickness may not
   be sharp or noisome, infectious or unusual, because these are
   circumstances of evil which are also proper instruments of temptation:
   and though it may well concern the prudence of thy religion to fear
   thyself, and keep thee from violent temptations, who hast so often
   fallen in little ones, yet, even in these things, be sure to keep some
   degrees of indifferency; that is, if God will not be entreated to ease
   thee, or to change thy trial, then be importunate that thy spirit and
   its interest be secured, and let him do what seemeth good in his eyes.
   But as in the degrees of sickness thou art to submit to God, so in the
   kind of it (supposing equal degrees) thou art to be altogether
   incurious whether God call thee by a consumption or an asthma, by a
   dropsy or a palsy, by a fever in thy humours, or a fever in thy
   spirits; because all such nicety of choice is nothing but a colour to a
   legitimate impatience, and to make an excuse to murmur privately, and
   for circumstances, when in the sum of affairs we durst not own
   impatience. I have known some persons vehemently wish that they might
   die of a consumption, and some of these had a plot upon heaven, and
   hoped by that means to secure it after a careless life; as thinking a
   lingering sickness would certainly infer a lingering and a protracted
   repentance; and by that means they thought they should be safest:
   others of them dreamed it would be an easier death, and have found
   themselves deceived, and their patience hath been tired with a weary
   spirit and a useless body, by often conversing with healthful persons
   and vigorous neighbours, by uneasiness of the flesh and the sharpness
   of their bones, by want of spirits and a dying life; and, in
   conclusion, have been directly debauched by peevishness and a fretful
   sickness: and these men had better have left it to the wisdom and
   goodness of God; for they both are infinite.

   6. Be patient in the desires of religion; and take care that the
   forwardness of exterior actions do not discompose thy spirit, while
   thou fearest, that by less serving God in thy disability thou runnest
   backward in the accounts of pardon and the favour of God. Be content
   that the time which was formerly spent in prayer be now spent in
   vomiting and carefulness and attendances; since God hath pleased it
   should be so, it does not become us to think hard thoughts concerning
   it. Do not think that God is only to be found in a great prayer, or a
   solemn office: he is moved by a sigh, by a groan, by an act of love;
   and therefore, when your pain is great and pungent, lay all your
   strength upon it, to bear it patiently: when the evil is something more
   tolerable, let your mind think some pious, though short, meditation;
   let it not be very busy, and full of attention; for that will be but a
   new temptation to your patience, and render your religion tedious and
   hateful. But record your desires, and present yourself to God by
   general acts of will and understanding, and by habitual remembrances of
   your former vigorousness, and by verification of the same grace, rather
   than proper exercises. If you can do more, do it; but if you cannot,
   let it not become a scruple to thee. We must not think man is tied to
   the forms of health, or that he who swoons and faints is obliged to his
   usual forms and hours of prayer: if we cannot labour, yet let us love.
   Nothing can hinder us from that but our own uncharitableness.

   7. Be obedient to thy physician in those things that concern him, if he
   be a person fit to minister unto thee. God is he only that needs no
   help, and God hath created the physician for thine: therefore use him
   temperately without violent confidences, and sweetly without uncivil
   distrustings, or refusing his prescriptions upon humours or impotent
   fear. A man may refuse to have his arm or leg cut off, or to suffer the
   pains of Marius's incision; and if he believes that to die is the less
   evil, he may compose himself to it without hazarding his patience, or
   introducing that which he thinks a worse evil; but that which in this
   article is to be reproved and avoided is, that some men will choose to
   die out of fear of death, and send for physicians, and do what
   themselves list, and call for counsel and follow none. When there is
   reason they should decline him, it is not to be accounted to the stock
   of a sin; but where there is no just case there is a direct impatience.

   Hither is to be reduced, that we be not too confident of the physician,
   or drain our hopes of recovery from the fountain through so imperfect
   channels, laying the wells of God dry, and digging to ourselves broken
   cisterns. Physicians are the ministers of God's mercies and providence
   in the matter of health and ease, of restitution or death; and when God
   shall enable their judgments, and direct their counsels, and prosper
   their medicines, they shall do thee good, for which you must give God
   thanks, and to the physician the honour of a blessed instrument. But
   this cannot always be done: and Lucius Cornelius, [110] the lieutenant
   in Portugal under Fabius the consul, boasted in the inscription of his
   monument, that he had lived a healthful and vegete age till his last
   sickness, but then complained he was forsaken by his physician and
   railed upon Esculapius for not accepting his vow and passionate desire
   of preserving his life longer; and all the effect of that impatience
   and folly was, that it is recorded to folling ages that he died without
   reason and without religion. But it was a sad sight to see the favour
   of all France confined to a physician and a barber, and the king (Louis
   XI.) to be so much their servant, that he should acknowledge and own
   his life from them, and all his ease to their gentle dressing of his
   gout and friendly ministries; for the king thought himself undone and
   robbed if he should die; his portion here was fair; and he was loath to
   exchange his possession for the interest of a bigger hope.

   8. Treat thy nurses and servants sweetly, and as it becomes an obliged
   and a necessitous person. Remember that thou art very troublesome to
   them; that they trouble not thee willingly; that they strive to do thee
   ease and benefit, that they wish it, and sigh and pray for it, and are
   glad if thou likest their attendance; that whatsoever is amiss is thy
   disease, and the uneasiness of thy head or thy side, thy distemper or
   thy disaffections; and it will be an unhandsome injustice to be
   troublesome to them because thou art so to thyself; to make them feel a
   part of thy sorrows, that thou mayest not bear them alone; evilly to
   requite their care by thy too curious and impatient wrangling and
   fretful spirit. That tenderness is vicious and unnatural that shieks
   out under the weight of a gentle cataplasm; and he will ill comply with
   God's rod that cannot endure his friends; greatest kindness; and he
   will be very angry (if he durst) with God's smiting him that is peevish
   with his servants that go about to ease him.

   9. Let not the smart of your sickness make you to call violently for
   death; you are not patient unless you be content to live; [111] God
   hath wisely ordered that we may be the better reconciled with death,
   because it is the period of many calamities; but wherever the general
   hath placed thee, stir not from thy station until thou beest called
   off, but abide so, that death may come to thee by the design of him who
   intends it to be thy work, and do not impatiently long for evening,
   lest at night thou findest the reward of him that was weary of his
   work; for he that is weary before his time is an unprofitable servant,
   and is either idle or diseased.

   10. That which remains in the practice of this grace is, that the sick
   man should do acts of patience by way of prayer and ejaculations; in
   which he may serve himself of the following collection.

    Acts of Patience by way of Prayer and Ejaculation.

   I will seek unto God, unto God will I committ my cause, which doth
   great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number. Job.
   v. 8, 9, 11, 16-19, 26.

   To set up on high those that be low, that those which mourn may be
   exalted to safety.

   So the poor have hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

   Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not
   thou the chastening of the Almighty.

   For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make a
   whole.

   He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no
   evil touch thee.

   Thou shalt come to thy grave in a just age, like as a shock of corn
   cometh in his season.

   I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate upon thee in the night
   watches. Because thou hast been my help, therefore under the shadow of
   thy wings will I rejoice. My soul followeth hard after thee; for thy
   right hand hath upholden me. Psalm lxiii. 6-8.

   God restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for
   his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
   death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
   they comfort me. Psalm xxiii. 3, 4.

   In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavillion; in the secret
   of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
   Psalm xxvii. 5.

   The Lord hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from the
   heaven did the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of his
   prisoners; to loose those that are appointed to death. Psalm cii. 19,
   20.

   I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice, and he
   gave ear unto me. In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my sore
   ran in the night and ceased not; my soul refused to be comforted; I
   remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was
   overwhelmed. Thou holdest mine eyes waking; I am so troubled that I
   cannot speak. Will the Lord cast me off for ever? and will he be
   favourable no more? Is his promise clean gone for ever? Doth his
   promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he
   in anger shut up his tender mercies? And I said, This is my infirmity;
   but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. Psalm
   lxxvii. 1-4, 7-10.

   No temptation hath taken me but such as is common to man; but God is
   faithful, who will not suffer me to be tempted above what I am able;
   but will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape, that I may be
   able to bear it. 1 Cor. x. 13.

   Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning;
   that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have
   hope. Now the God of peace and consolation grant me to be so minded.
   Rom. xv. 4, 5.

   It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth good in his eyes. 1 Sam. iii.
   18.

   Surely the word that the Lord hath spoken is very good, but thy servant
   is weak: O remember mine infirmities; and lift thy servant up that
   leaneth upon thy right hand.

   There is given unto me a thorn in the flesh to buffet me. For this
   thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he
   said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made
   perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, I will glory in my
   infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For when I am
   weak, then am I strong. 2 Cor. xii. 7-10.

   O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my
   life. And I said, My strength and my hope is in the Lord; remembering
   my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. My soul hath
   them still in remembrance, and is humbled within me. This I recall to
   my mind, therefore I have hope.

   It is the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his
   compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is thy
   faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, said my soul; therefore will I
   hope in him.

   The Lord is good to them that wait for him; to the soul that seeketh
   him. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
   salvation of the Lord. For the Lord will not cast off for ever. But
   though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the
   multitude of his mercies. For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve
   the children of men. Lam. iii. 58, 18-26, 31-33, 39.

   Wherefore doth a living man complain - a man for the punishment of his
   sins? O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave (of Jesus), that thou
   wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past; that thou wouldest
   appoint me a set time, and remember me! Job, xiv. 13.

   Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
   evil? Job, ii. 20.

   The sick man may recite, or hear recited, the following Psalms in the
   intervals of his agony.

    I.

   O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot
   displeasure. Psalm vi.

   Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my
   bones are vexed.

   My soul is also vexed; but thou, O Lord, how long?

   Return, O Lord, deliver my soul; O save me for thy mercy sake.

   For in death no man groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim: I
   water my couch with my tears.

   Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all my
   (sorrows).

   Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the
   voice of my weeping.

   The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.

   Blessed by the Lord, who hath heard my prayer, and hath not turned his
   mercy from me.

    II.

   In the Lord put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to
   your mountain? Psalm xi.

   The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven; his
   eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

   Preserve me, O God; for in thee do I put my trust. Psalm xvi.

   O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord; my goodness
   extendeth not to thee.

   The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; thou
   maintainest my lot.

   I will bless the Lord who hath given me counsel; my reins also instruct
   me in the night seasons.

   I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I
   shall not be moved.

   Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also shall
   rest in hope.

   Thou wilt show me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of
   joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

   As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
   satisfied when I awake with thy likeness. Psalm xvii.

    III.

   Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed
   with grief; yea, my soul and my belly. Psalm xxxi.

   For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength
   faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

   I am like a broken vessel.

   But I trusted in thee, O Lord; I said, Thou art my God.

   My times are in thy hand; make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save
   me for thy mercy's sake.

   When thou saidst, Seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, Thy face,
   Lord, will I seek. Psalm xxvii.

   Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of
   man; thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavillion from the strife of
   tongues, (from the calumnies and aggravation of sins by devils).

   I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless
   thou heardest the voice of my supplication when I cried unto thee.

   O love the Lord, all ye his saints; for the Lord preserveth the
   faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.

   Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that
   hope in the Lord.

   The Prayer to be said at the beginning of Sickness.

   O Almighty God, merciful and gracious, who in thy justice didst send
   sorrow and tears, sickness and death, into the world, as a punishment
   for man's sins, and hast comprehended all under sin, and this sad
   covenant of sufferings, not to destroy us, but that thou mightest have
   mercy upon all, making thy justice to minister to mercy, short
   afflictions to an eternal weight of glory; as thou hast turned my sins
   into sickness, so turn my sickness to the advantages of holiness and
   religion, of mercy and pardon, of faith, and hope, of grace and glory.
   Thou hast now called me to the fellowship of sufferings: Lord, by the
   instrument of religion let my present condition be so sanctified that
   my sufferings may be united to the sufferings of my Lord, that so thou
   mayst pity me and assist me. Relieve my sorrow and support my spirit;
   direct my thoughts, and sanctify the accidents of my sickness; and that
   the punishment of my sin may be the school of virtue, in which, since
   thou hast now entered me, Lord, make me a holy proficient, that I may
   behave myself as a son under discipline, humbly and obediently, evenly
   and penitently; that I may come by this means nearer unto thee; that,
   if I shall go forth of this sickness by the gate of life and health, I
   may return to the world with great strengths of spirit, to run a new
   race of a stricter holiness and a more severe religion; or, if I pass
   from hence with the outlet of death, I may enter into the bosom of my
   Lord, and may feel the present joys of a certain hope of that sea of
   pleasures, in which all thy saints and servants shall be comprehended
   to eternal ages. Grant this for Jesus Christ's sake, our dearest Lord
   and Saviour. Amen.

   An Act of Resignation to be said by a Sick Person in all the evil
   Accidents of his Sickness.

   O eternal God, thou hast made me and sustained me; thou hast blessed me
   in all the days of my life, and hast taken care of me in all variety of
   accidents; and nothing happens to me in vain, nothing without thy
   providence; and I know thou smitest thy servants in mercy, and with
   designs of the greatest pity in the world; Lord, I humbly lie down
   under thy rod: do with me as thou pleaseth; do thou choose for me not
   only the whole state and condition of being, but every little and great
   accident of it. Keep me safe by thy grace, and then use what instrument
   thou pleaseth of bringing me to thee. Lord, I am not solicitous of the
   passage, so I may get to thee. Only, O Lord, remember my infirmities,
   and let thy servant rejoice in thee always, and feel and confess and
   glory in thy goodness. O, be thou as delightful to me in this my
   medicinal sickness as ever thou wert in any of the danger of my
   prosperity; let me not peevishly refuse thy pardon at the rate of a
   severe discipling. I am thy servant and thy creature, thy purchased
   possession, and thy son; I am all thine; and because thou hast mercy in
   store for all that trust in thee, I cover mine eyes, and in silence
   wait for the time of my redemption. Amen.

   A Prayer for the Grace of Patience.

   Most merciful and gracious Father, who, in the redemption of lost
   mankind by the passion of thy most holy Son, hast established a
   covenant of sufferings, I bless and magnify thy name that thou hast
   adopted me into the inheritance of sons, and hast given me a portion of
   my elder brother. Lord, the cross falls heavy and sits uneasy upon my
   shoulders; my spirit is willing, but my flesh is weak: I humbly beg of
   thee that I may now rejoice in this thy dispensation and effect of
   Providence. I know and am persuaded that thou art then as gracious when
   thou smitest us for amendment or trial, as when thou relievest our
   wearied bodies in compliance with our infirmity. I rejoice, O Lord, in
   thy rare and mysterious mercy, who by sufferings hast turned our misery
   into advantages unspeakable: for so thou makest us like to thy Son, and
   givest us a gift that the angels never did receive; for they cannot die
   in conformity to, and imitation of, their Lord and ours; but, blessed
   by thy name, we can: and, dearest Lord, let it be so. Amen.

    II.

   Thou, who art the God of patience and consolation, strengthen me in the
   inner man, that I may bear the yoke and burden of the Lord without any
   uneasy and useless murmurs and ineffective unwillingness. Lord, I am
   unable to stand under the cross, unable of myself; but thou, O holy
   Jesus, who didst feel the burden of it, who didst sink under it, and
   wert pleased to admit a man to bear part of the load, when thou under
   wentest all for him, be thou pleased to ease this load by fortifying my
   spirit, that I may be strongest when I am weakest, and may be able to
   do and suffer every thing thou pleased through Christ, who strengthens
   me. Lord, if thou wilt support me, I will for ever praise thee; if thou
   wilt suffer the load to press me yet more heavily, I will cry unto
   thee, and complain unto my God; and at last I will lie down and die,
   and by the mercies and intercession of the holy Jesus, and the conduct
   of thy blessed Spirit, and the ministry of angels, pass into those
   mansions where holy souls rest and weep no more. Lord, pity me; Lord,
   sanctify this my sickness; Lord, strengthen me; holy Jesus, save me and
   deliver me. Thou knowest how shamefully I have fallen with pleasure; in
   thy mercy and very pity, let me not fall with pain too. O let me never
   charge God foolishly, nor offend thee by my impatience and uneasy
   spirit, nor weaken the hands and hearts of those that charitably
   minister to my needs: but let me pass through the valley of tears and
   the valley of the shadow of death with safety and peace, with a meek
   spirit and a sense of the divine mercies; and though thou breakest me
   in pieces, my hope is thou wilt gather me up in the gatherings of
   eternity. Grant this, eternal God, gracious Father, for the merits and
   intercession of our merciful High-priest, who once suffered for me, and
   for ever intercedes for me, our most gracious and ever-blessed Saviour
   Jesus.

   A Prayer to be said when the Sick Man takes Physic.

   O most blessed and eternal Jesus, thou who art the great physician of
   our souls, and the Sun of Righteousness arising with healing in thy
   wings, to thee is given by thy heavenly Father the government of all
   the world, and thou disposest every great and little accident to thy
   Father's honour, and to the good and comfort of them that love and
   serve thee; be pleased to bless the ministry of thy servant in order to
   ease and health, direct his judgment, prosper the medicines, and
   dispose the chances of my sickness fortunately, that I may feel the
   blessing and loving-kindness of the Lord in the ease of my pain and the
   restitution of my health; that I, being restored to the society of the
   living, and to thy solemn assemblies, may praise thee and thy goodness
   secretly among the faithful, and in the congregation of thy redeemed
   ones here in the outer-courts of the Lord, and hereafter in thy eternal
   temple for ever and ever. Amen.

  SECTION III.

    Of the Practice of the Grace of Faith in the Time of Sickness.

   Now is the time in which the faith appears most necessary and most
   difficult. It is the foundation of a good life, and the foundation of
   all our hopes; it is that without which we cannot live well, and
   without which we cannot die well; it is a grace that then we shall need
   to support our spirits, to sustain our hopes, to alleviate our
   sickness, to resist temptation, to prevent despair; upon the belief of
   the articles of our religion we can do the works of a holy life; but
   upon belief of the promises we can bear our sickness patiently, and die
   cheerfully. The sick man may practise it in the following instances.

   1. Let the sick man be careful that he do not admit of any doubt
   concerning that which he believed and received from a common consent in
   his best health and days of election and religion. For if the devil can
   but prevail so far as to unfix and unrivet the resolution and
   confidence or fulness of assent, it is easy for him so to unwind the
   spirit, that from why to whether or no, from whether or no to scarcely
   not, from scarcely to absolutely not at all, are steps of a descending
   and falling spirit; and whatsoever a man is made to doubt of by the
   weakness of his understanding in a sickness, it will be hard to get an
   instrument strong or subtle enough to reinforce and insure: for when
   the strengths are gone by which faith held, and it does not stand firm
   by the weight of its own bulk and great constitution, nor yet by the
   cordage of a tenacious root, then it is prepared for a ruin, which it
   cannot escape in the tempests of a sickness and the assaults of a
   devil. Discourse and argument, the line of tradition and a
   never-failing experience, the Spirit of God and the truth of miracles,
   the word of prophecy and the blood of martyrs, the excellency of the
   doctrine and the necessity of men, the riches of the promises and the
   wisdom of the revelations, the reasonableness and sublimity, the
   concordance and the usefulness of the articles, and their compliance
   with all the needs of man, and the government of commonwealths, are
   like the strings and branches of the roots by which faith stands firm
   and unmovable in the spirit and understanding of a man. But in sickness
   the understanding is shaken, and the ground is removed in which the
   root did grapple and support its trunk; [112] and therefore there is no
   way now but that it be left to stand upon the old confidences, and by
   the firmament of its own weight; it must be left to stand, because it
   always stood there before; and as it stood all his life-time in the
   ground of understanding, so it must now he supported with will and a
   fixed resolution. [113] But the disputation tempts it, and shakes it
   with trying, and overthrows it with shaking. Above all things in the
   world let the sick man fear a proposition which his sickness hath put
   into him contrary to the discourses of health and a sober untroubled
   reason.

   2. Let the sick man mingle the recital of his creed together with his
   devotions, and in that let him account his faith; not in curiosity and
   factions, in the confessions of parties and interests: [114] for some
   over-forward zeals are so earnest to profess their little and uncertain
   articles, and glory so to die in a particular and divided communion,
   that in the profession of their faith they lose or discompose their
   charity. Let it be enough that we secure our interest of heaven, though
   we do not go about to appropriate the mansions to our sect; for every
   good man hopes to be saved, as he is a Christian, and not as he is a
   Lutheran, or of another division. However, those articles upon which he
   can build the exercise of any virtue in his sickness, or upon the stock
   of which he can improve his present condition, are such as consist in
   the greatness and goodness, the veracity and mercy of God through Jesus
   Christ; nothing of which can be concerned in the fond disputations
   which faction and interest hath too long maintained in Christendom.

   3. Let the sick man's faith especially be active about the promises of
   grace, and the excellent things of the gospel; those which can comfort
   his sorrows and enable his patience; those upon the hopes of which he
   did the duties of his life, and for which he is not unwilling to die;
   such as the intercession and advocation of Christ, remission of sins,
   the resurrection, the mysterious arts and mercies of man's redemption,
   Christ's triumph over death and all the powers of hell, the covenant of
   grace, or the blessed issues of repentance; and, above all, the article
   of eternal life, upon the strength of which eleven thousand virgins
   went cheerfully together to their martyrdom, and twenty thousand
   Christians were burned by Diocesian on a Christman-day, and whole
   armies of Asian Christians offered themselves to the tribunals of Arius
   Antonius, and whole colleges of severe persons were instituted, who
   lived upon religion, whose dinner was the eucharist, whose supper was
   praise, and their nights were watches, and their days were labour; for
   the hopes of which then men counted it gain to lose their estates, and
   gloried in their sufferings, and rejoiced in their persecutions, and
   were glad at their disgraces. This is the article that hath made all
   the martyrs of Christ confident and glorious; and if it does not more
   than sufficiently strengthen our spirits to the present suffering, it
   is because we understand it not, but have the appetites of beasts and
   fools. But if the sick man fixes his thoughts, and sets his habitation
   to dwell here, he swells his hope, and masters his fears, and eases his
   sorrows, and overcomes his temptations.

   4. Let the sick man endeavour to turn his faith of the articles into
   the love of them; and that will be an excellent instrument, not only to
   refresh his sorrows, but to confirm his faith in defiance of all
   temptations. For a sick man and a disturbed understanding are not
   competent and fit instruments to judge concerning the reasonableness of
   a proposition. But therefore let him consider and love it, because it
   is useful and necessary, profitable and gracious; and when he is once
   in love with it, and then also renews his love to it, when he feels the
   need of it, he is an interested person, and for his own sake will never
   let it go, and pass into the shadows of doubting, or the utter darkness
   of infidelity. And act of love will make him have a mind to it; and we
   easily believe what we love, but very uneasily part with our belief,
   which we for so great an interest have chosen and entertained with a
   great affection.

   5. Let the sick person be infinitely careful that his faith be not
   tempted by any man, or any thing; and when it is in any degree
   weakened, let him lay fast hold upon the conclusion, upon the article
   itself, and by earnest prayer beg of God to guide him in certainty and
   safety. For let him consider that the article is better than all its
   contrary or contradictory, and he is concerned that it be true, and
   concerned also that he do believe it: but he can receive no good at all
   if Christ did not die, if there be no resurrection, if his creed hath
   deceiven him; therefore all that he is to do is to secure his hold,
   which he can do no way but by prayer and by his interest. And by this
   argument or instrument it was that Socrates refreshed the evil of his
   condition, when he was to drink his aconite. [115] "If the soul be
   immortal, and perpetual rewards be laid up for wise souls, then I lose
   nothing by my death: but if there be not, then I lose nothing by my
   opinion; for it supports my spirit in my passage, and the evil of being
   deceived cannot overtake me when I have no being." So it is with all
   that are tempted in their faith. If those articles be not true, then
   the men are nothing; if they be true, then they are happy: and if the
   articles fail, there can be no punishment for believing; but if they be
   true, my not believing destroys all my portion in them and possibility
   to receive the excellent things which they contain. By faith we quench
   the fiery darts of the devil; but if our faith be quenched, wherewithal
   shall we be able to endure the assault? Therefore seize upon the
   article, and secure the great object, and the great instrument, that
   is, the hopes of pardon and eternal life through Jesus Christ; and do
   this by all means, and by any instrument, artificial or in artificial,
   by argument or by stratagem, by perfect resolution or by discourse, by
   the hand and ears of premises or the foot of conclusion, by right or by
   wrong; because we understand it; or because we love it, super totam
   materiam; because I will, and because I ought; because it is safe to do
   so, and because it is not safe to do otherwise; because if I do I may
   receive a good; and because if I do not I am miserable; either for that
   I shall have a portion of good things without it.

  SECTION IV.

    Acts of Faith, by way of Prayer and Ejaculation to be said by Sick Men, in
    the Days of their Temptation.

   Lord, whither shall I go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. John,
   vi. 68.

   I believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ, his only
   Son, our Lord, etc.

   And I believe in the Holy Ghost, etc.

   Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. Mark, ix. 24.

   I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that none of us liveth to
   himself, and no man dieth to himself: for whether we live, we live unto
   the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live
   therefore or die, we are the lord's. Rom. xiv. 14, 7, 8.

   If God be for us, who can be against us? Rom. viii. 31-34.

   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him give us all things?

   Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea,
   rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God; who
   also maketh intercession for us.

   If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins. 1 John, ii. 1, 2.

   This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus
   Christ came into the world to save sinners. 1 Tim. i. 15.

   O grant that I may obtain mercy, that in me Jesus Christ may show forth
   all long-suffering, that I may believe in him to life everlasting.

   I am bound to give thanks unto God alway, because God hath from the
   beginning chosen me to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit,
   and belief of the truth, whereunto he called me by the gospel, to the
   obtaining of thy glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Thess. ii. 13, 14,
   16, 17.

   Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God even our Father which hath
   loves us, and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope
   through grace, comfort my heart, and stablish me in every good word and
   work.

   The Lord direct my heart into the love of God, and into the patient
   waiting for Christ. 2 Thess. iii. 5.

   O that our God would count me worthy of this calling, and fulfil all
   the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power;
   that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in me, and I in
   him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 2
   Thess. i. 11, 12.

   Let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith
   and love, and for an helmet the hope of salvation. For God hath not
   appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep we should live
   together with him. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one
   another. 1 Thess. v. 8-10, 12.

   There is no name under heaven whereby we can be saved, but only the
   name of the Lord Jesus. Acts, iv. 12. And every soul which will not
   hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people. Acts, iii.
   23.

   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of Jesus Christ. Gal.
   vi. 14. I desire to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified. 1
   Cor. ii. 2. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. Phil. i.
   21.

   Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he
   to be accounted of? Isa. ii. 22. But the just shall live by faith. Hab.
   ii. 4.

   Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, John, xi. 27;
   the Saviour of the world, John iv. 42; the resurrection and the life;
   and he that believeth in thee, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
   John, xi. 25-40.

   Jesus said unto her, Said I not to thee, that if thou wouldest believe,
   thou shouldest see the glory of God?

   O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting
   of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law. But thanks be to
   God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
   make me steadfast and unmovable, always abounding in the work of the
   Lord: for I know that my labour is not in vain in the Lord. 1 Cor. xv.
   55-58.

   The Prayer for the Grace and Strengths of Faith.

   O holy and eternal Jesus, who didst die for me and all mankind,
   abolishing our sin, reconciling us to God, adopting us into the portion
   of thine heritage, and establishing with us a covenant of faith and
   obedience, making our souls to rely upon spiritual strengths, by the
   supports of a holy belief, and the expectation of rare promises, and
   the infallible truths of God: O let me for ever dwell upon the rock,
   leaning upon thy arm, believing thy word, trusting in thy promises,
   waiting for thy mercies, and doing thy commandments; that the devil may
   not prevail upon me, and my own weaknesses may not abuse or unsettle my
   persuasions, nor my sins discompose my just confidence in thee and thy
   eternal mercies. let me always be thy servant and thy disciple, and die
   in the communion of thy church, of all faithful people. Lord, I
   renounce whatsoever is against thy truth; and if secretly I have or do
   believe any false proposition, I do it in the simplicity of my heart
   and great weakness; and, if I could discover it, would dash it in
   pieces by a solemn disclaiming it; for thou art the way, the truth, and
   the life. And I know that whatsoever thou hast declared, that is the
   truth of God; and I do firmly adhere to the religion thou hast taught,
   and glory in nothing so much as that I am a Christian, that thy name is
   called upon me. O my God, though I die, yet will I put my trust in
   thee. In thee, O Lord, have I trusted; let me never be confounded.
   Amen.

  SECTION V.

    Of the Practice of the Grace of Repentance in the Time of Sickness.

   Men generally do very much dread sudden death, and pray against it
   passionately; and certainly it hath in it great inconveniences
   accidentally to men's estates, to the settlement of families, to the
   culture and trimming of souls; and it robs a man of the blessing which
   may be consequent to sickness, and to the passive graces and holy
   contentions of a Christian, while he descends to his grave without an
   adversary or a trial; [116] and a good man may be taken at such a
   disadvantage, that a sudden death would be a great evil even to the
   most excellent person if it strikes him in an unlucky circumstance. But
   these considerations are not the only ingredients into those men's
   discourse who pray violently against sudden deaths; for possibly if
   this were all, there may be in the condition of sudden death something
   to make recompence for the evils of the over-hasty accident. For
   certainly it is a less temporal evil to fall by the rudeness of a sword
   than the violence of a fever, and the axe is much a less affliction
   than a strangury; and though a sickness tries our virtues, yet a sudden
   death is free from temptation; a sickness may be more glorious, and a
   sudden death more safe. The deadest deaths are best, the shortest and
   least premeditate, [117] so Caesar said; and Pliny called a short death
   the greatest fortune of a man's life. For even good men have been
   forced to an indecency of deportment by the violences of pain: [118]
   and Cicero observes concerning Hercules, that he was broken in pieces
   with pain even then when he sought for immortality by his death, being
   tortured with a plague knit up in the lappet of his shirt. [119] And
   therefore as a sudden death certainly loses the rewards of a holy
   sickness, so it makes that a man shall not so much hazard and lose the
   rewards of a holy life.

   But the secret of this affair is a worse matter; men live t that rate
   either of an habitual wickedness, or else a frequent repetition of
   single acts of killing and deadly sins, that a sudden death is the ruin
   of all their hopes, and a perfect consignation to an eternal sorrow.
   But in this case also so is a lingering sickness: for our sickness may
   change us from life to health, from health to strength, from strength
   to the firmness and confirmation of habitual graces; but it cannot
   change a man from death to life, and begin and finish that process
   which sits not down but in the bosom of blessedness. He that washes in
   the morning when his bath is seasonable and healthful, [120] is not
   only made clean, but sprightly, and the blood is brisk and coloured
   like the first springing of the morning; but they that wash their dead
   cleanse the skin, and leave paleness upon the cheek, and stiffness in
   all the joints. A repentance upon our deathbed is like washing the
   corpse: it is cleanly and civil; but makes no change deeper than the
   skin. But God knows it is a custom so to wash them that are going to
   dwell with dust, and to be buried in the lap of their kindred earth,
   but all their lives time wallow in pollutions without any washing at
   all; or if they do, it is like that of the Dardani, who washed but
   thrice all their lifetime, when they were born, and when they marry,
   and when they die; when they are baptized, or against a solemnity, or
   for the day of their funeral; but these are but ceremonious washings,
   and never purify the soul if it be stained and hath sullied the
   whiteness of its baptismal robes.

   God intended we should live a holy life; he contracted with us in Jesus
   Christ for a holy life; he made no abatements of the strictest sense of
   it, but such as did necessarily comply with human infirmities or
   possibilities; that is, he understood it in the sense of repentance,
   which still is so to renew our duty, that it may be a holy life in the
   second sense; that is, some great portion of our life to be spent in
   living as Christians should. A resolving to repent upon our death-bed
   is the greatest mockery of God in the world, and the most perfect
   contradictory to all his excellent designs of mercy and holiness: for
   therefore he threatened us with hell if we did not, and he promised
   heaven if we did live a holy life; and a late repentance promises
   heaven to us upon other conditions, even when we have lived wickedly.
   It renders a man useless and intolerable to the world; taking off the
   great curb of religion, of fear and hope, and permitting all impiety
   with the greatest impunity and encouragement in the world. By this
   means we see so many patuax poluchronious, as Philo calls them, or as
   the prophets, pueros centum annorum, children of almost a hundred years
   old, upon whose grave we may write the inscription which was upon the
   tomb of Similis in Xiphilin. "Here he lies who was so many years, but
   lived but seven." And the course of nature runs counter to the perfect
   designs of piety; and God, who gave us a life to live to him, is only
   served at our death when we die to all the world; and we undervalue the
   great promises made by the holy Jesus, [121] for which the piety, the
   strictest unerring piety often thousand ages is not a proportionable
   exchange: yet we think it a hard bargain to get to heaven if we be
   forced to part with one lust, or live soberly twenty years; but, like
   Demetrius Afer, (who having lived a slave all his life-time, yet
   desiring to descend to his grave in freedom, [122] begged manumission
   of his lord,) we lived in the bondage of our sin all our days, and hope
   to die the Lord's freed-men. But above all, this course of a delayed
   repentance must of necessity therefore be ineffective and certainly
   mortal, because it is an entire destruction of the very formality and
   essential constituent reason of religion: which I thus demonstrate.

   When God made man and propounded to him an immortal and a blessed state
   as the end of his hopes and the perfection of his condition, he did not
   give it him for nothing, but upon certain conditions; which, although
   they could add nothing to God, yet they were such things which man
   could value, and they were his best: and God had made appetites of
   pleasure in man, that in them the scene of his obedience should lie.
   For when God made instances of man's obedience, he, 1. Either commanded
   such things to be done which man did naturally desire; or, 2. Such
   things which contradict his natural desires; or, 3. Such which were
   indifferent. Not the first and the last: for it could be no effect of
   love or duty towards God for a man to eat when he was impatiently
   hungry and could not stay from eating; neither was it any contention of
   obedience or labour of love for a man to look eastward once a day, or
   turn his back when the north wind blew fierce and loud. Therefore for
   the trial and in stance of obedience, God made his laws so that they
   should lay restraint upon man's appetites, so that man might part with
   something of his own, that he may give to God his will, and deny it to
   himself for the interest of his service: and chastity is the denial of
   a violent desire; and justice is parting with money that might help to
   enrich me; and meekness is a huge contradiction to pride and revenge;
   and the wandering of our eyes, and the greatness of our fancy, and our
   imaginative opinions, are to be lessened that we may serve God. There
   is no other way of serving God; we have nothing else to present unto
   him: we do not else give him anything or part of ourselves, but when we
   for his sake part with what we naturally desire; and difficulty is
   essential to virtue, and without choice there can be no reward, and in
   the satisfaction of our natural desires there is no election; we run to
   them as beasts to the river or the crib. If, religion that satisfied
   all our natural desires in the days of desires and passion, of lust and
   appetites, and only turns to God when his appetites are gone and his
   desires cease, this man hath overthrown the very being of virtues, and
   the essential constitution of religion: religion is no religion, and
   virtue is no act of choice, and reward comes by chance and without
   condition, if we only are religious when we cannot choose; if we part
   with our money when we cannot keep it; with our lust when we cannot act
   it; with our desires when they have left us. Death is a certain
   mortifier; but that mortification is deadly, not useful to the purposes
   of a spiritual life. When we are compelled to depart from our evil
   customs, and leave to live, that we may begin to live, then we die to
   die; that life is the prologue to death, and thenceforth we die
   eternally.

   St. Cyril speaks of certain people that chose to worship the sun
   because he was a day-god; for believing that he was quenched every
   night in the sea, or that he had no influence upon them that light up
   candles, and lived by the light of fire, they were confident they might
   be Atheists all night, and live as they list. Men who divide their
   little portion of time between religion and pleasures, between God and
   God's enemy, think that God is to rule but in hiscertai period of time,
   and that our life is the stage for passion and folly, and the day of
   death for the work of our life. But as to God both the day and the
   night are alike, so are the first and last of our days: all are his
   due, and he will account severely with us for the follies of the first,
   and the evil of the last. The evils and the pains are great which are
   reserved for those who defer their restitution to God's favour till
   their death. And therefore Antisthenes said well, "It is not the happy
   death, but the happy life, that makes man happy." It is in piety, as in
   fame and reputation: he secures a good name but loosely that trusts his
   fame and celebrity only to his ashes; and it is more a civility than
   the basis of a firm reputation that men speak honour of their departed
   relatives; but if their life be virtuous, it forces honour from
   contempt, and snatches it from the hand of envy, and it shines through
   the crevices of detraction; and as it anointed the head of the living,
   so it embalms the body of the dead. [123] From these premises it
   follows, that when we discourse of a sick man's repentance it is
   intended to be not a beginning, but the prosecution and consummation of
   the covenant of repentance which Christ stipulated with us in baptism,
   and which we needed all our life, and which we began long before this
   last arrest, and in which we are now to make further progress, that we
   may arrive to that integrity and fulness of duty, that our sins may be
   blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence
   of the Lord.' [124]

  SECTION VI. Rules for the Practice of Repentance in Sickness.

    Rules for the Practice of Repentance in Sickness.

   1. Let the sick man consider at what gate this sickness entered; and if
   he can discover the particular, let him instantly, passionately, and
   with great contrition, dash the crime in pieces, lest he descends into
   his grave in the midst of a sin, and thence remove into an ocean of
   eternal sorrow. But if he only suffers the common fate of man, and
   knows not the particular inlet, he is to be governed by the following
   measures.

   2. Inquire into the repentance of thy former life particularly; whether
   it were of a great and perfect grief, and productive of fixed
   resolutions of holy living, and reductive of these to act; how many
   days and nights we have spent in sorrow or care, in habitual and actual
   pursuances of virtue; what instrument we have chosen and used for the
   eradication of sin; how we have judged ourselves, and how punished;
   and, in sum, whether we have by the grace of repentance changed our
   life from criminal to virtuous, from one habit to another; and whether
   we have paid for the pleasure of our sin by smart or sorrow, by the
   effusion of alms, or pernctations or abodes in prayers, so as the
   spirit hath been served in our repentance s earnestly and as greatly as
   our appetites have been provided for in the days of our shame and
   folly.

   3. Supply the imperfections of thy repentance by a general or universal
   sorrow for thy sins, not only since the last communion or absolution,
   but of thy whole life; for all sins, known and unknown, repented and
   unrepented, of ignorance or infirmity, which thou knowest, or which
   others have accused thee of; thy clamorous and thy whispering sins, the
   sins of scandal and the sins of a secret conscience, of the flesh and
   of the spirit: for it would be but a sad arrest to thy soul wandering
   in strange and unusual regions, to see a scroll of uncancelled sins
   represented and charged upon thee for want of care and notices, and
   that thy repentance shall become invalid because of its imperfections.

   4. To this purpose it is usually advised by spiritual persons, that the
   sick man make an universal confession, or a renovation and repetition
   of all the particular confessions and accusations of his whole life;
   that now, at the foot of his account, he may represent the sum total to
   God and his conscience, and make provisions for their remedy and pardon
   according to his present possibilities.

   5. Now is the time to make reflex acts of repentance: that as by a
   general repentance we supply the want of the just extension of parts,
   so by this we may supply the proper measures of the intention of
   degrees. In our health we can consider concerning our own acts, whether
   they be real or hypocritical, essential or imaginary, sincere or upon
   interest, integral or imperfect, commensurate or defective. And
   although it is a good caution of securities after all our care and
   diligence still to suspect ourselves and our own deceptions, and for
   ever to beg of God pardon and acceptance in the union of Christ's
   passion and intercession: yet, in proper speaking, reflex acts of
   repentance, being a suppletory after the imperfection of the direct,
   and then most fit to be used when we cannot proceed in and prosecute
   the direct actions. To repent because we cannot repent, and to grieve
   because we cannot grieve, was a device invented to serve the turn of
   the mother of Peter Gratian; but it was used by her, and so advised to
   be, in her sickness and last actions of repentance: for in our perfect
   health and understanding, if we do not understand our first act we
   cannot discern our second; and if we be not sorry for our sins we
   cannot be sorry for want of sorrows: it is a contradiction to say we
   can; because want of sorrow, to which we are obliged, is certainly a
   great sin; and if we can grieve for that, then also for the rest; if
   not for all, then not for this. But in the days of weakness the case is
   otherwise; for then our actions are imperfect, our discourse weak, our
   internal actions not discernible, our fears great, our work to be
   abbreviated, and our defects to be supplied by spiritual arts: and
   therefore it is proper and proportionate to our state, and to our
   necessity, to beg of God pardon for the imperfections of our
   repentance, acceptance of our weaker sorrows, supplies out of the
   treasures of grace and mercy. And thus repenting of the evil and
   unhandsome adherences of our repentance, in the whole integrity of the
   duty it will become a repentance not to be repented of.

   6. Now is the time beyond which the sick man must at no hand defer to
   make restitution of all his unjust possessions, [125] or other men's
   rights, and satisfactions for all injuries and violences, according to
   his obligation and possibilities: for although many circumstances might
   impede the acting it in our life-time, and it was permitted to be
   deferred in many cases because by it justice was not hindered, and
   oftentimes piety and equity were provided for; yet, because this is the
   last scene of our life, he that does not act it so far as he can, or
   put it into certain conditions and order of effecting, can never do it
   again, and therefore then to defer it is to omit, and leaves the
   repentance defective in an integral and constituent part.

   7. Let the sick man be diligent and watchful that the principle of his
   repentance be contrition, or sorrow for sins, commenced upon the love
   of God. For although sorrow for sins upon any motive may lead us to God
   by many intermedial passages, and is the threshold of returning
   sinners; yet it is not good nor effective upon our death-bed; because
   repentance is not then to begin, but must then be finished and
   completed; and it is to be a supply and preparation of all the
   imperfections of that duty, and therefore it must by that time be
   arrived to contrition; that is, is must have grown from fear to love,
   from the passions of a servant to the affections of a son. The reason
   of which (besides the precedent) is this, because when our repentance
   is in this state it supposes the man also in a state of grace, a
   well-grown Christian; for to hate sin out of the love of God is not the
   felicity of a new convert, or an infant grace; (or if it be that love
   also is in its infancy;) but it supposes a good progress, and the man
   habitually virtuous, and tending to perfection: and therefore
   contrition or repentance so qualified is useful to great degrees of
   pardon, because the man is a gracious person, and that virtue is of
   good degree, and consequently a fit employment for his that shall work
   no more, but is to appear before his Judge to receive the hire of his
   day. And if his repentance be contrition even before this state of
   sickness, let it be increased by spiritual arts and the proper
   exercises of charity.

   Means of exciting Contrition, or Repentance of Sins, proceeding from
   the Love of God.

   To which purpose the sick man may consider, and is to be reminded (if
   he does not) that there are in God all the motives and causes of
   amiability in the world: that God is so infinitely good, that there are
   some of the greatest and most excellent spirits of heaven, whose work,
   and whose felicity and whose perfections, and whose nature it is, to
   flame and burn in the brightest and most excellent love: that to love
   God is the greatest glory of heaven: that in him there are such
   excellences, that the smallest rays of them, communicated to our weaker
   understandings, are yet sufficient to cause ravishments, and
   transportations, and satisfactions, and joys unspeakable and full of
   glory: that all the wise Christians of the world know and feel such
   causes to love God, that they all profess themselves ready to die for
   the love of God, and the apostles and millions of the martyrs did die
   for him: and although it be harder to live in his love than to die for
   it, yet all the good people that ever gave their names to Christ did,
   for his love, endure the crucifying their lusts, the mortification of
   their appetites, the contradictions and death of their most passionate
   natural desires: that kings and queens have quitted their diadems, and
   many married saints have turned their mutual vows into the love of
   Jesus, and married him only, keeping a virgin chastity in a married
   life, that they may more tenderly express their love to God: that all
   the good we have derives from God's love to us, and all the good we can
   hope for is the effect of his love, and can descend only upon them that
   love him: that by his love we feel peace and joy within our spirits,
   and by his love we receive the mysterious sacrament. And what can be
   greater than that from the goodness and love of God we receive Jesus
   Christ, and the Holy Ghost, and adoption, and the inheritance of sons,
   and to be coheirs with Jesus, and to have pardon of our sins, and a
   Divine nature, and restraining grace and the grace of sanctification,
   and rest and peace within us, and a certain expectation of glory? Who
   can choose but love him who, when we had provoked him exceedingly, sent
   his Son to die for us, that we might live with him? who does so desire
   to pardon us and save us, that he hath appointed his holy Son
   continually to intercede for us? that his love is so great, that he
   offers us great kindness, and entreats us to be happy, and makes many
   decrees in heaven concerning the interest of our soul, and the very
   provision and support of our persons, that he sends an angel to attend
   upon every of his servants, and to be their guard and their guide in
   all their dangers and hostilities: that for our sakes he restrains the
   devil, and put his mightiness in fetters and restraints, and chastises
   his malice with decrees of grace and safety: that he it is who makes
   all the creatures serve us, and takes care of our sleeps and preserves
   all plants and elements, all minerals and vegetables, all beasts and
   birds, all fishes and insects, for food to us and for ornament, for
   physic and instruction, for variety and wonder, for delight, and for
   religion: that as God is all good in himself, and all good to us, so
   sin is directly contrary to God, to reason, to religion, to safety, and
   pleasure, and felicity: that it is a great dishonour to a man's spirit
   to have been made a fool by a weak temptation and an empty lust; and to
   have rejected God who is so rich, so wise, so good, and so excellent,
   so delicious, and so profitable to us: that all the repentance in the
   world of excellent men does end in contrition, or a sorrow for sins
   preceeding from the love of God; because they that are in the state of
   grace do not fear hell violently, and so long as they remain in God's
   favour, although they suffer the infirmities of men, yet they are God's
   portion; and therefore all the repentance of just and holy men, which
   is certainly the best, is a repentance not for lower ends, but because
   they are the friends of God, and they are full of indignation that they
   have done an act against the honour of their pardon, and their dearest
   Lord and Father: that it is a huge imperfection and a state of weakness
   to need to be moved with fear or temporal respects; and they that are
   so, as yet are either immerged in the affections of the world or of
   themselves; and those men that bear such a character, are not et
   esteemed laudable persons, or men of good natures, or the sons of
   virtue: that no repentance can be lasting that relies upon any thing
   but the love of God; for temporal motives may cease, and contrary
   contingencies may arise, and fear of hell may be expelled by natural or
   acquired hardnesses, and is always the least when we have most need of
   it, and most cause for it; for the more habitual our sins are, the more
   cauterized our conscience is, the less is the fear of hell, and yet our
   danger is much the greater: that although fear of hell or other
   temporal motives may be the first inlet to a repentance, yet repentance
   , in that constitution and under those circumstances, cannot obtain
   pardon, because there is in that no union with God, no adhesion to
   Christ, no endearment of passion or of spirit, no similitude or
   conformity to the great instrument of our peace, our glorious Mediator:
   for as yet a man is turned from his sin, but not converted to God; the
   first and last of our returns to God being love, and nothing but love:
   for obedience is the first part of love, and fruition is the last; and
   because he that does not love God cannot obey him, therefore he that
   does not love him cannot enjoy him.

   Now that this may be reduced to practice, the sick man may be
   advertised, that in the actions of repentance, he separate low,
   temporal, sensual, and self-ends from his thoughts, and so do his
   repentance that he may still reflect honour upon God, that he confess
   his justice in punishing, that he acknowledge himself to have deserved
   the worst of evils; that he heartily believe and profess that if he
   perish finally, yet that God ought to be glorified by that sad event,
   and that he hath truly merited so intolerable a calamity: that he also
   be put to make acts of election and preference, professing that he
   would willingly endure all temporal evils, rather than be in the
   disfavour of God or in the state of sin; for, by this last instance, he
   will be quitted from the suspicion of leaving sin for temporal
   respects, because he, by an act of imagination or feigned presence of
   the object to him, entertains the temporal evil that he may leave the
   sin; and therefore, unless he be a hypocrite, does not leave the sin to
   be quit of the temporal evil. And as for the other motive of leaving
   sin out of the fear of hell, because that is an evangelical motive
   conveyed to us by the Spirit of God, and is immediate to the love of
   God, if the schoolmen had pleased, they might have reckoned it as the
   handmaid, and of the retinue of contrition; but the more the
   considerations are sublimed above this, of the greater effect and the
   more immediate to pardon will be the repentance.

   5. Let the sick persons do frequent actions of repentance, by way of
   prayer for all those sins which are spiritual, and in which no
   restitution or satisfaction material can be made, and whose contrary
   acts cannot in kind be exercised. For penitential prayers in some cases
   are the only instances of repentance that can be. An envious man, if he
   gives God hearty thanks for the advancement of his brother, hath done
   an act of mortification of his envy, as directly as corporal
   austerities are an act of chastity, and an enemy to uncleanness: and if
   I have seduced a person that is dead or absent, if I cannot restore him
   to sober counsels by my discourse and undeceiving him, I can only
   repent of that by way of prayer: and intemperance is no way to be
   rescinded or punished by a dying man but by hearty prayers. Prayers are
   a great help in all cases; in some they are proper acts of virtue, and
   direct enemies to sin: but although alone and in long continuance they
   alone can cure some one or some few little habits, yet they can never
   alone change the state of a man: and therefore are intended to be a
   suppletory to the imperfections of other acts: and by that reason are
   the proper and most pertinent employment of a clinic or death-bed
   penitent.

   6. In those sins whose proper cure is mortification corporal, the sick
   man is to supply that part of his repentance by a patient submission to
   the rod of sickness: for sickness does the work of penances, or sharp
   afflictions and dry diet, perfectly well: to which if we also put our
   wills, and make it our act by an after-election, by confessing the
   justice of God, by bearing it sweetly, by begging it may be medicinal,
   there is nothing wanting to the perfection of this part, but that God
   confirm our patience and hear our prayers. When the guilty man runs to
   punishment [126] the injured person is prevented, and hath no whither
   to go but to forgiveness.

   7.I have learned but of one suppletory more for the perfection and
   proper exercise of a sick man's repentance; but it is such an one as
   will go a great way in the abolition of our past sins and making our
   peace with God, even after a less severe life; and that is, that the
   sick man do some heroical actions in the matter of charity or religion,
   of justice or severity. There is a story of an infamous thief who,
   having begged his pardon of the emperior Mauricius, was yet put into
   the hospital of St. Sampson, where he so plentifully bewailed his sins
   in the last agonies of his death, that the physician who attended found
   him unexpectedly dead, and over his face a handkerchief bathed in
   tears; and soon after, somebody or other pretended to a revelation of
   this man's beatitude. It was a rare grief that was noted in this man,
   which begot in that age a confidence of his being saved: and that
   confidence (as things then went) was quickly called a revelation. But
   it was a stranger severity which is related by Thomas Cantipratanus,
   concerning a young gentleman condemned for robbery and violence, who
   had so deep a sense of his sin, that he was not content with a single
   death, but begged to be tormented, and cut in pieces joint by joint,
   with intermedial senses, that he might, by such a smart, signify a
   great sorrow. Some have given great estates to the poor and to
   religion; some have built colleges for holy persons; many have suffered
   martyrdom: and though those that died under the conduct of the
   Maccabees, in defence of their country and religion, had pendants on
   their breasts consecrated to the idols of the Mamnenses; yet that they
   gave their lives in such a cause with so great a duty, (the biggest
   things they could do or give,) it was esteemed to prevail hugely
   towards the pardon and acceptation of their persons. An heroic action
   of virtue in a huge compendium of religion: for if it be attained to by
   the usual measures and progress of a Christian from inclination to act,
   from act to habit, from habit to abode, from abode to reigning, from
   reigning to perfect possession, from possession to extraordinary
   emanations, that is, to heroic actions, then it must needs do the work
   of man, by being so great towards the work of God: but if a man comes
   thither per saltum, or on a sudden, (which is seldom seen,) then it
   supposes the man always well inclined, but abused by accident or hope,
   by confidence or ignorance; then it supposes the man for the present in
   a great fear of evil, and a passionate desire of pardon; it supposes
   his apprehensions great and his time little; and what the event of that
   will be no man can tell; but it is certain that to some purposes God
   will account for our religion on our death-bed, not by the measures of
   our time, but the eminency of affection; (as said Celestine the First;
   [127] ) that is, supposing the man in the state of grace, or in the
   revealed possibility of salvation, then an heroical act hath the reward
   of a longer series of good actions in an even and ordinary course of
   virtue.

   8. In what can remain for the perfecting of a sick man's repentance, he
   is to be helped by the ministries of a spiritual guide.

  SECTION VII.

    Acts of Repentance, by way of Prayer and Ejaculation, to be used especially
    by Old Men in their Age, and by all Men in their Sickness.

   Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. Let us lift
   up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens. We have
   transgressed and rebelled; and thou hast not pardoned. Thou hast
   covered with anger and persecuted us; thou hast slain, thou hast not
   pitied. O cover not thyself with a cloud, but let our prayer pass
   through. Lam. iii. 40-44.

   I have sinned: what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Why
   hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to
   myself? And why dost not thou pardon my transgression, and take away
   mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust, and thou shalt seek
   me in the morning, but I shall not be. Job. vii. 20, 21.

   The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandments.
   Hear, I pray, all ye people, behold my sorrow. Behold, O Lord, I am in
   distress; my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I
   have grievously rebelled. Lam. i. 18, 40.

   Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to
   generation. Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so
   long time? Turn thou us into thee, O Lord, and so shall we be turned;
   renew our days as of old. O reject me not utterly, and be not exceeding
   wroth against thy servant. Lam. v. 19-22.

   O remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; but
   according to thy mercies remember thou me, for thy goodness sake, O
   Lord. Psalm. xxv. 7. Do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy name's
   sake; because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. For I am poor and
   needy, and my heart, is wounded within me. I am gone like the shadow
   that declineth; I am tossed up and down as the locust. Psalm cix.
   21-23.

   Then Zeccheus stood forth, and said, Behold, Lord, half of my goods I
   give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man, I restore him
   fourfold. Luke, xix. 8.

   Hear my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire. Psalm cxliii. 1. Let my
   prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting up
   of my hands be an evening sacrifice. Psalm cxli. 3. And enter not into
   judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man be justified.
   Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let
   thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness. Psalm
   cxliii. 2, 10.

   I will speak of mercy and judgment; unto thee, O Lord, will I make my
   prayer. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
   come unto me? I will walk in my house with a perfect heart. I will set
   no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn
   aside; it shall not cleave to me. Psalm ci. 1-3.

   Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in
   me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Deliver me
   from blood-guiltiness, O God, from malice, envy, the follies of lust
   and violence, of passion, etc., thou God of my salvation; and my tongue
   shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. Psalm li. 9,10,14.

   The sacrifice of God is a broken heart: a broken and a contrite heart,
   O God, thou wilt not despise. ver. 17.

   Lord, I have done amiss; I have been deceived; let so great a wrong as
   this be removed, and let it be so no more.

   The Prayer for the Grace and Perfection of Repentance.

   O Almighty God, thou art the great judge of all the world, the father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, the father of men and
   angels; thou lovest not that a sinner should perish, but delightest in
   our conversion and salvation, and hast, in our Lord Jesus Christ,
   established the covenant of repentance, and promised pardon to all them
   that confess their sins and forsake them; O my God, be thou pleased to
   work in my what thou hast commanded should be in me. Lord, I am a dry
   tree, who neither have brought forth fruit unto thee and unto holiness,
   nor have wept out salutary tears, the instrument of life and
   restitution, but have behaved myself like an unconcerned person in the
   ruins and breaches of my soul: but, O God, thou art my God, early will
   I seek thee; my soul thirsteth for thee in a barren and thirsty land
   where no water is. [128] Lord, give me the grace of tears and pungent
   sorrow; let my heart be as a land of rivers of waters, and my head a
   fountain of tears; turn my sin into repentance, and let my repentance
   proceed to pardon and refreshment.

    II.

   Support me with thy graces, strengthen me with thy Spirit, soften my
   heart with the fire of thy love and the dew of heaven, with penitential
   showers; make my care prudent, and the remaining portion of my days
   like the perpetual watches of the night, full of caution and
   observance, strong and resolute, patient and severe. I remember, O
   Lord, that I did sin with greediness and passion, with great desires
   and an unabated choice; O let me be as great in my repentance as ever I
   have been in my calamity and shame; let my hatred of sin be as great as
   my love to thee, and both as near to infinite as my proportion can
   receive.

    III.

   O Lord, I renounce all affection to sin, and would not buy my health
   nor redeem my life with doing any thing against the laws of my God, but
   would rather die than offend thee. O dearest Saviour, have pity upon
   thy servant; let me, by thy sentence, be doomed to perpetual penance
   during the abode of this life; let every sigh be the expression of a
   repentance and every groan an accent of spiritual life, and every
   stroke of my disease a punishment of my sin and an instrument of
   pardon; that, at my return to the land of innocence and pleasure, I may
   eat of the votive sacrifice of the supper of the Lamb, that was, from
   the beginning of the world, slain for the sins of every sorrowful and
   returning sinner. O grant the sorrow here and joy hereafter, through
   Jesus Christ, who is our hope, the resurrection of the dead, the
   justifier of a sinner, and the glory of all faithful souls. Amen.

   A Prayer for Pardon of Sins, to be said frequently in time of Sickness,
   and in all the portions of Old Age.

   O eternal and most gracious Father, I humbly throw myself down at the
   foot of thy mercy-seat upon the confidence of thy essential mercy, and
   thy commandment that we should come boldly to the throne of grace, that
   we may find mercy in time of need. O my God, hear the prayers and cries
   of a sinner who calls earnestly for mercy. Lord, my needs are greater
   than all the degrees of my desire can be; unless thou hast pity upon
   me, I perish infinitely and intolerably; and then there will be one
   voice fewer in the choir of singers who shall recite thy praises to
   eternal ages. But, O Lord, in mercy deliver my soul. O save me for thy
   mercy's sake. [129] For in the second death there is no remembrance of
   thee: in that grave, who shall give thee thanks?

    II.

   O just and dear God, my sins are innumerable; they are upon my soul in
   multitudes; they are a burden too heavy for me to bear; they already
   bring sorrow and sickness, shame and displeasure, guilt and decaying
   spirit, a sense of thy present displeasure, and fear of worse, of
   infinitely worse. But it is to thee so essential, so delightful, so
   usual, so desired by thee to show mercy, that although my sin be very
   great, and my fear proportionable, yet thy mercy is infinitely greater
   than all the world, and my hope and my comfort rise up in proportions
   towards it, that I trust the devils shall never be able to reprove it,
   nor my own weakness discompose it. Lord, thou hast sent thy Son to die
   for the pardon of my sins; thou hast given me thy Holy Spirit as a seal
   of adoption to consign the article of remission of sins; thou hast, for
   all my sins, still continued to invite my to conditions of life by thy
   ministers the prophets; and thou hast, with variety of holy acts,
   softened my spirit, and possessed my fancy, and instructed my
   understanding, and bended and inclined my will, and directed or
   overruled my passions, in order to repentance and pardon: and why
   should not thy servant beg passionately, and humbly hope for, the
   effects of all these thy strange and miraculous acts of
   loving-kindness? Lord, I deserve it not, but I hope thou wilt pardon
   all my sins; and I beg it of thee for Jesus Christ's sake, whom thou
   hast made the great endearment of thy promises, and the foundation of
   our hopes, and the mighty instrument whereby we can obtain of thee
   whatsoever we need and can receive.

    III.

   O my God, how shall thy servant be disposed to receive such a favour
   which is so great that the ever-blessed Jesus did die to purchase it
   for us; so great that the falling angels never could give all that have
   sinned against me; O forgive me my sins, as I forgive them that have
   sinned against me. Lord, I confess my sins unto thee daily by the
   accusations and secret acts of conscience; and if we confess us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Lord, I put my trust
   in thee; and thou art ever gracious to them that put their trust in
   thee. I call upon my God for mercy; and thou art always more ready to
   hear than we to pray. But all that I can do, and all that I am, and all
   that I know of myself, is nothing but sin, and infirmity, and misery:
   therefore I go forth of myself, and throw myself wholly into the arms
   of thy mercy through Jesus Christ, and beg of thee, for his death and
   passion's sake, by his resurrection and ascension, by all the parts of
   our redemption, and thy infinite mercy, in which thou pleaseth thyself
   above all the works of the creation, to be pitiful and compassionate to
   thy servant in the abolition of all my sins; so shall I praise thy
   glories with a tongue not defiled with evil language, and a heart
   purged by thy grace, quitted by thy mercy, and absolved by thy
   sentence, from generation to generation. Amen.

   An Act of holy Resolution of Amendment of Life, in case of Recovery.

   O most just and merciful Lord God, who hast sent evil diseases, sorrow
   and fear, trouble and uneasiness, briers and thorns, into the world,
   and planted them in our houses, and round about our dwellings, to keep
   sin from our souls, or to drive it thence; I humbly beg of thee that
   this my sickness may serve the ends of the spirit, and be a messenger
   of spiritual life, an instrument of reducing me to more religious and
   sober courses. I say, O Lord, that I am unready and unprepared in my
   accounts, having thrown away great portions of my time in vanity, and
   set myself hugely back in the accounts of eternity, and I had need live
   my life over gain, and live it better; but thy counsels are in the
   great deep, and thy footsteps in the water; and I know not what thou
   wilt determine of me. If I die I throw myself into the arms of the holy
   Jesus, whom I love above all things, and if I perish I know I have
   deserved it; but thou wilt not reject him that loves thee. But if I
   recover, I will live, by thy grace and help, to do the work of God, and
   passionately pursue my interest of heaven, and serve thee in the labour
   of love with the charities of a holy zeal, and the diligence of a firm
   and humble obedience. Lord, I will dwell in thy temple and in thy
   service; religion shall be my employment, and alms shall be my
   recreation, and patience shall be my rest, and to do thy will shall be
   my meat and drink, and to live shall be Christ, and then to die shall
   be gain.

   O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, before I go hence,
   and be no more seen.' Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.'
   Amen.

  SECTION VIII.

    An Analysis or Resolution of the Decalogue, and the special Precepts of the
    Gospel, describing the Duties enjoined, and the Sins forbidden respectively;
    for the Assistance of sick Men in making their Confessions to God and his
    Ministers, and the rendering their Repentance more particular and perfect.

   1. Thou shalt have none other gods but me.

   Duties commanded are, 1. To love God above all things. 2. To obey him
   and fear him. 3. To worship him with prayers, vows, thanksgiving,
   presenting to him our souls and bodies, and all such actions and
   expressions, which the consent of nations, or the laws and customs of
   the place where we live, have appropriated to God. 4. To design all to
   God's glory. 5. To inquire after his will. 6. To believe all his word.
   7. To submit to his providence. 8. To proceed towards all our lawful
   ends by such means as himself hath appointed. 9. To speak and think
   honourably of God, and recite his praises, and confess his attributes
   and perfections.

   They sin against this commandment, 1. Who love themselves or any of the
   creatures inordinately and intemperately. 2. They that despise or
   neglect any of the Divine precepts. 3. They that pray to unknown or
   false gods. 4. They that disbelieve or deny there is a God. 5. They
   that make vows to creatures. 6. Or say prayers to the honour of men, or
   women, or angels; as paternosters to the honour of the Virgin Mary, or
   St. Peter, which is a taking a part of that honour which is due to God
   and giving it to the creature; it is a religion paid to men and women
   our of God's proper portion, out of prayers directed to God
   immediately; and it is an act contrary to that religion, which makes
   God that last end of all things; for this, through our addresses to
   God, passes something to the creatures as if they stood beyond him; for
   by the intermedial worship paid to God, they ultimately do honour to
   the man or angel. 7. They that make consumptive oblations to the
   creatures; as the Collyridians who offered cakes, and those that burnt
   incense or candles to the Virgin Mary. 8. They that give themselves to
   the devil, or make contracts with him, and use fantastic conversation
   with him. 9. They that consult witches and fortune-tellers. 10. They
   that rely upon dreams and superstitions observeanes. 11. That use
   charms, spells, superstitious words and characters, verses of psalms,
   the consecrated elements, to cure diseases, to be shot-free, to recover
   stolen goods, or inquire into secrets. 12.That are wilfully ignorant of
   the laws of God, or love to be deceived in their persuasions that they
   may sin with confidence. 13. They that neglect to pray to God. 14. They
   that arrogate to themselves the glory of any action or power, and do
   not give the glory to God, as Herod. 15. They that doubt of or
   disbelieve any article of the Creed, or any proposition of Scripture,
   or put false glosses to serve secular or vicious ends, against their
   conscience, or with violence any way done to their reason. 16. They
   that violently or passionately pursue any temporal end with an
   eagerness greater than the thing is in prudent account. 17. They that
   make religion to serve ill ends, or do good to evil purposes, or evil
   to good purposes. 18. They that accuse God of injustice or
   unmercifulness, remissness of cruelty; such as are the presumptuous and
   the desperate. 19. All hypocrites and pretenders to religion, walking
   in forms and shadows, but denying the power of godliness. 20. All
   impatient persons; all that repine or murmur against the prosperities
   of the wicked, or the calamities of the godly, or their own
   afflictions. 21. All that blaspheme God, or speak dishonourable things
   of so sacred a Majesty. 22. They that tempt God, or rely upon his
   protection against his rules, and without his promise and besides
   reason, entering into danger, from which, without a miracle, they
   cannot be rescued. 23. They that are bold in the midst of judgment, and
   fearless in the midst of the Divine vengeance, and the accents of his
   anger.

   II. Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor worship it.

   The moral duties of this commandment are, 1. To worship God with all
   bodily worship and external forms of address, according to the custom
   of the church we live in. 2. To believe God to be a spiritual and pure
   substance, without any visible form or shape. 3. To worship God in ways
   of his own appointing, or by his proportions, or measures of nature,
   and right reason, or public and holy customs.

   They sin against this commandment, 1. That make any image or pictures
   of the Godhead, or fancy any likeness to him. 2. They that use images
   in their religion, designing or addressing any religious worship to
   them; for if this thing could be naturally tolerable, yet it is too
   near an intolerable for a jealous God to suffer. 3. They that deny to
   worship God with lowly reverence of their bodies, according as the
   church expresses her reverence to God externally. 4. They that invent
   or practice superstitious worshippings, invented by man against God's
   word, or without reason, or besides the public customs or forms of
   worshipping, either foolishly or ridiculously, without the purpose of
   order, decency, proportion to a wise or a religious end, in prosecution
   of some virtue or duty.

   III. Thou shalt not take God's name in vain.

   The duties of this commandment are. 1. To honour and revere the most
   holy name of God. 2. To invocate his name directly, or by consequence,
   in all solemn and permitted adjurations or public oaths. 3. To use all
   things and persons, upon whom his name is called, or any ways
   imprinted, with a regardful and separate manner of usage, different
   from common, and far from contempt and scorn. 4. To swear in truth and
   judgment.

   They sin against this commandment, 1. Who swear vainly and customarily,
   without just cause, without competent authority. 2. They that blaspheme
   or curse God. 3. They that speak of God without grave cause or solemn
   occasion. 4. They that forswear themselves, that is, they that do not
   perform their vows to God, or that swear, or call God to witness to a
   lie. 5. They that swear rashly or maliciously to commit a sin or an act
   of revenge. 6. They that swear by any creature falsely, or any way but
   as it relates to God, and consequently invokes his testimony. 7. All
   curious inquirers into the secrets, and intruders into the mysteries
   and hidden things of God. 8. They that curse God, or curse a creature
   by God. 9. They that profane churches, holy utensils, holy persons,
   holy customs, holy sacraments. 10. They that provoke others to swear
   voluntarily and by design, or incuriously, or negligently, when they
   might avoid it. 11. They that swear to things uncertain and unknown.

   IV. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.

   The duties of this commandment are, 1. To set apart some portions of
   our time for the immediate offices of religion and glorification of
   God. 2. This is to be done according as God or his holy church hath
   appointed. 3. One day in seven is to be set apart. 4. The Christian day
   is to be subrogated into the place of the Jews' day; the resurrection
   of Christ and the redemption of man was a greater blessing than to
   create him. 5. God on that day to be worshipped and acknowledged as our
   Creator and as our Saviour. 6. The day to be spent in holy offices, in
   hearing divine service, public prayers, frequenting the congregations,
   hearing the word of God read or expounded, reading good books,
   meditations, alms, reconciling enumities, remission of burdens and of
   offences, of debts and of work; friendly offices, neighbourhood, and
   provoking one another to good works; and to this end all servile works
   must be omitted, excepting necessary and charitable offices to men or
   beasts, to ourselves or others.

   They sin against this commandment. 1. That do, or compel, or entice
   others to do, servile works without the cases of necessity or charity,
   to be estimated according to common and prudent accounts. 2. They that
   refuse or neglect to come to the public assemblies of the church, to
   hear and assist at the Divine offices entirely. 3. They that spend the
   day in idleness, forbidden or vain recreations, or the actions of sin
   and folly. 4. They that buy and sell without the cases of permission.
   5. They that travel unnecessary journeys. 6. They that act or assist in
   contentions or lawsuits, markets, fairs, etc. 7. They that on that day
   omit their private devotions, unless the whole day be spent in public.
   8. They that by any cross or contradictory actions against the customs
   of the church, do purposely desecrate or unhollow and make the day
   common; as they that, in despite and contempt, fast upon the Lord's
   day, lest they may celebrate the festival after the manner of the
   Christians.

   V. Honour thy father and thy mother.

   The duties are, 1. To do honour and reverence to, and to love our
   natural parents. 2. To obey all their domestic commands, for in them

   support in their needs. 4. To obey kings and all that are in authority.

   That publish their vices, errors, and infirmities, to shame them. 4.
   That refuse and reject all or any of their lawful commands. 5. Children
   that marry without or against their consent, when it may be reasonable
   obtained. 6. That curse them from whom they receive so many blessings.
   7. That grieve the souls of their parents by not complying in their
   desires, and observing their circumstances. 8. That hate their persons,
   that mock them or use uncomely jestings. 9. That discover their
   nakedness voluntarily. 10. That murmur against their injunctions, and
   obey them involuntarily. 11. All rebels against their kings, or the
   supreme power, where it is legally and justly invested. 12. That refuse
   to pay tributes and impositions imposed legally. 13. They that disobey
   their masters, murmur or repine against their commands, abuse or deride
   their persons, talk rudely, etc. 14. They that curse the king in their
   heart, or speak evil of the ruler of their of their people. 15. All
   that are uncivil and rude towards aged persons, mockers and scorners of
   them. [130]

   VI.Thou shalt do no murder.

   The duties are, 1. To preserve our own lives, the lives of our
   relatives, and all with whom we converse, (or who can need us, and we
   assist,) by prudent, reasonable, and wary defences, advocations,
   discoveries of snares, etc. 2. To preserve our health, and the
   integrity of our bodies and minds, and of others. 3. To preserve and
   follow peace with all men.

   refuse to rescue or preserve those whom they can and are obliged to
   preserve. 9. They that procure abortion. 10. They that threaten, or
   keep men in fears, or hate them.

   VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

   The duties are 1. To preserve our bodies in the chastity of a single
   life, or of marriage. 2. To keep all the parts of our bodies in the
   care and severities of chastity, so that we be restrained in our eyes
   as well as in our feet.

   They sin against this commandment, 1. Who are adulterous, incestuous,
   sodomitical, or commit fornication. 2. They that commit folly alone,
   dishonouring their own bodies with softness and wantonness. 3. They
   that immoderately let loose the reins of their bodley appetite, though
   within the protection of marriage. 4. They that by wanton gestures,
   wandering eyes, lascivious dressings, discovery of the nakedness of
   themselves or others, filthy discourse, high diet, amorous songs, balls
   and revellings, tempt and betray themselves or others to folly. 5. They
   that marry a woman divorced for adultery. 6. They that divorce their
   wives, except for adultery, and marry another.

   VIII. Thou shalt not steal.

   The duties are, 1. To give every man his due. 2. To permit every man to
   enjoy his own goods and estate quietly.

   They sin against this commandment, 1. That injure any man's estate by
   open violence or by secret robbery, by stealth or cozenage, by arts of
   bargaining or vexatious lawsuits. 2. That refuse or neglect to pay
   their debts when they are able. 3. That are forward to run into debt
   knowingly beyond their power, without hopes or purposes of repayment.
   4. Oppressors of the poor. 5. That exact usury of necessitous persons,
   or of any beyond the permissions of equity, as determined by the laws.
   6. All sacrilegious persons, people that rob God of his dues or of his
   possessions. 7. All that game, viz. at cards and dice, etc., to the
   prejudice and detriment of other men's estates. 8. They that embase
   coin and metals, and obtrude them for perfect and natural. 9. That
   break their promises to the detriment of a third person. 10. They that
   refuse to stand to their bargains. 11. They that by negligence imbecile
   other men's estates, spoiling or letting any thing perish which is
   entrusted to them. 12. That refuse to restore the pledge.

   IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness.

   The duties are, 1. To give testimony to truth, when we are called to it
   by competent authority. 2. To preserve the good name of our neighbours.
   3. To speak well of them that deserve it.

   They sin against this commandment, 1. That speak false things in
   judgment, accusing their neighbour unjustly, or denying his crime
   publicly when they are asked, and can be commanded lawfully to tell it.
   2. Flatterers; and 3. Slanderers; 4. Backbiters; and 5. Detractors. 6.
   They that secretly raise jealousies and suspicion of their neighbours
   causelessly.

   X. Thou shalt not covet.

   The duties are, 1. To be content with the portion God hath given us. 2.
   Not to be covetous of other men's goods.

   They sin against this commandment, 1. That envy the prosperity of other
   men. 2. They that desire passionately to be possessed of what is their
   neighbour's. 3. They that with greediness pursue riches, honours,
   pleasures, and curiosities. 4. They that are too careful, troubled,
   distracted, or amazed, affrighted and afflicted with being solicitous
   in the conduct of temporal blessings.

   These are the general lines of duty by which we may discover our
   failings and be humbled, and confess accordingly: only the penitent
   person is to remember, that although these are the kinds of sins
   described after the sense of the Jewish church, which consisted
   principally in the external action or the deed done, and had no
   restraints upon the thoughts of men, save only in the tenth commandment
   which was mixed, and did relate as much to action as to thought; (as
   appears in the instances;) yet upon us Christians there are many
   circumstances and degrees of obligation, which endear our duty with
   greater severity and observation: and the penitent is to account of
   himself and enumerate his sins, not only by external actions or the
   deed done, but by words and by thoughts; and so to reckon if we have
   done it directly or indirectly, if he have caused others to do it, by
   tempting or encouraging, by assisting or counselling, by not dissuading
   when he could and ought, by fortifying their hands or hearts, or not
   weakening their evil purposes; if we have designed or contrived its
   action, desired it or love it, delighted in the thought, remembered the
   past sin with pleasure or without sorrow: these are the by-ways of sin,
   and the crooked lanes, in which a man may wander and be lost, as
   certainly as in the broad highways of iniquity.

   But besides this our blessed Lord and his apostles have added divers
   other precepts; some of which have been with some violence reduced to
   the decalogue, and others have not been noted at all in the catalogues
   of confession. I shall therefore describe them entirely, that the sick
   man may discover his failings, that, by the mercies of God in Jesus
   Christ, and by the instrument of repentance, he may be presented pure
   and spotless before the throne of God.

   The Special Precepts of the Gospel.

   1. Prayer, frequent, fervent, holy, and persevering. [131] 2. Faith.
   [132] 3. Repentance. [133] 4. Poverty of spirit, as opposed to ambition
   and high designs. [134] 5. And in it is humility, or sitting down in
   the lowest place, and in giving honour to go before another. [135] 6.
   Meekness, as it is opposed to waywardness, fretfulness, immoderate
   grieving, disdain and scorn. [136] 7. Contempt of the world. 8.

   that have the rule over us in spiritual affairs. [141] 15. Refusing to
   communicate with persons excommunicate: whither also may be reduced, to

   things; brotherly kindness, or profitable love to our neighbours as
   ourselves, to be expressed in alms. forgiveness, and to die for our
   brethren. 17. To pluck out the right eye, or violently to rescind all
   occasions of sins, though dear to us as an eye. [144] 18. To reprove
   our erring brother. 19. To be patient in afflictions; and long animity
   is referred hither or long-sufferance; which is the perfection and
   perseverance of patience, and is opposed to hastiness and weariness of
   spirit. 20. To be thankful to our benefactors; but above all, in all
   things to give thanks to God. 21. To rejoice in the Lord always. 22.
   Not to quench, not to grieve, not to resist the Spirit. 23. To love our

   all things that are of good report, or the actions of public honesty,
   abstaining from all appearances of evil. 33. To convert souls, or turn
   sinners from the error of their ways. 34. To confess Christ before all
   the world. 35. To resist unto blood, if God call us to it. 36. To
   rejoice in tribulation for Christ's sake. 37. To remember and show
   forth the Lord's death till his second coming, by celebrating the
   Lord's supper. 38. To believe all the New Testament. 39. To add nothing
   to St. John's last book, that is, to pretend to no new revelations. 40.
   To keep the customs of the church, her festivals and solemnities; lest
   we be reproved, as the Corinthians were by St. Paul, We have no such
   customs, nor the churches of God.' 41. To contend earnestly for the
   faith. Not to be contentious in matters not concerning the eternal
   interest of our souls; but in matters indifferent to have faith to
   ourselves. 42. Not to make schisms or divisions in the body of the
   church. 43. To call no man master upon earth; but to acknowledge Christ
   our master and lawgiver. 44. Not to domineer over the Lord's heritage.
   45. To try all things and keep that which is best. 46. To be temperate
   in all things. 47. To deny ourselves. 48. To mortify our lusts and
   their instruments. 49. To lend, looking for nothing again, nothing by
   way of increase, nothing by way of recompence. 50. To watch and stand
   in readiness against the coming of the Lord. 51. Not to be angry
   without cause. 52. Not at all to revile. 53. Not to swear. 54. Not to
   respect persons. 55. To lay hands suddenly on no man. (This especially
   pertains to bishops; to whom also, and to all the ecclesiastical order,
   it is enjoined that they preach the word, that they be instant in
   season and out of season, that they rebuke, reprove, exhort with all
   long-suffering and doctrine.) 56. To keep the Lord's day, (derived into
   an obligation from a practice apostolical.) 57. To do all things to the
   glory of God. 58. To hunger and thirst after righteousness and its
   rewards. 59. To avoid foolish questions. 60. To pray for persecutors,
   and to do good to them that persecute us, and despitefully use us. 61.
   To pray for all men. 63. To work with our own hands, that we be not
   burdensome to others, avoiding idleness. 64. To be perfect as our
   heavenly Father is perfect. 65. To be liberal and frugal; for he that
   will call us to an account for our time, will also for the spending our
   money. 66. Not to use uncomely jestings. 67. Modesty; as opposed to
   boldness, to curiosity, to indecency. 68. To be swift to hear, slow to
   speak. 69. To worship the holy Jesus as the mention of his holy name;
   as of old God was at the mention of Jehovah.

   These are the straight lines of Scripture by which we may also measure
   our obliquities, and discover crooked walking. If the sick man hath not
   done these things, or if he have done contrary to any of them in any
   particular, he hath cause enough for his sorrow and matter for his
   confession; of which he needs no other forms, but that he heartily
   deplore and plainly enumerate his follies, as a man tells the sad
   stories of his own calamity.

  SECTION IX.

    Of the Sick Mans Practice of Charity and Justice, by way of Rule

   1. Let the sick man set his house in order before he die; state his
   cases of conscience, reconcile the fractures of his family, reunite
   brethren, cause right understandings, and remove jealousies; give good
   counsels for the future conduct of their persons and estates, charm
   them into religion by the authority and advantages of a dying person;
   because the last words of a dying man are like the tooth of a wounded
   lion, making a deeper impression in the agony than in the most vigorous
   strength. [145]

   2. Let the sick man discover every secret of art or profit, physic or
   advantage to mankind, if he may do it without the prejudice of a third
   person. [146] Some persons are so uncharitably envious, that they are
   willing that a secret receipt should die with them, and be buried in
   their grave, like treasure in the sepulchre of David. But this, which
   is a design of charity, must therefore not be done to any man's
   prejudice; and the mason of Herodotus, the king of Egypt, who kept
   secret his notice of the king's treasure, and when he was a dying told
   his son, betrayed his trust then, when he should have kept it most
   sacredly for his own interest. In all other cases let thy charity
   outlive thee, that thou mayst rejoice in the mansion of rest, because,
   by thy means, many living persons are eased or advantaged.

   3. Let him make his will with great justice and piety, that is, that
   the right heirs be no defrauded for collareral respects, fancies, or
   indirect fondnesses; but the inheritances descend in their legal and
   due channel; and in those things where we have a liberty, that we take
   the opportunity of doing virtuously, that is, of considering how God
   may be best served by our donatives, or how the interest of any virtue
   may be promoted; in which we are principally to regard the necessities
   of our nearest kindred and relatives, servants and friends.

   4. Let the will or testament be made with ingenuity, openness, and
   plain expression, that he may not entail a lawsuit upon his posterity
   and relatives, and make them lose their charity, or entangle their
   estates, or make them poorer by the gift. He hath done me no charity,
   but dies in my debt that makes me sue for a legacy.

   5. It is proper for the state of sickness, and an excellent annealing
   us to burial, that we give alms in this state, so burying treasure in
   our graves that will not perish, but rise again in the resurrection of
   the just. Let the dispensation of our alms be as little intrusted to
   our executors as may be, excepting the lasting and successive portions;
   but with our own present care, let us exercise the charity and secure
   the stewardship. It was a custom amongst the old Greeks to bury horses,
   clothes, arms, and whatsoever was dear to the deceased person,
   supposing they might need them, and that without clothes they should be
   found naked by their judges; and all the friends did use to bring
   gifts, by such liberality thinking to promote the interest of their
   dead. But we may offer our entsphta ourselves best of all: our doles
   and funeral meals, if they be our own early provisions, will then spend
   the better; and it is good so to carry our passing penny in our hand,
   and, by reaching that hand to the poor make a friend in the everlasting
   habitations. He that gives with his own hand shall be sure to find it,
   and the poor shall find it; but he that trusts executors with his
   charity, and the economy and issues of his virtue, by which he must
   enter into his hopes of heaven and pardon, shall find but an ill
   account when his executors complain he died poor. Think on this. To
   this purpose, wise and pious was the counsel of Salvian: [147] "Let a
   dying man, who hath nothing else of which he may make an effective
   oblation, offer up to God of his substance; let him offer it with
   compunction and tears, with grief and mourning, as knowing that all our
   oblations have their value not by the price, but by the affection; and
   it is our faith that commendeth the money, since God receives the money
   by the hands of the poor, but at the same time gives and does not take
   the blessing, because he receives nothing but his own; and man gives
   that which is none of his own, that of which he is only a steward, and
   shall be accountable for every shilling. Let it, therefore, be offered
   humbly, as a creditor pays his debts; not magnifically, as a prince
   gives a donative; and let him remember that such doles do not pay for
   the sin, but they ease the punishment; that are not proper instruments
   of redemption, but instances of supplication and advantages of prayer;
   and when we have done well, remember that we have not paid our debt,
   but shown our willingness to give a little of the vast sum we owe; and
   he that gives plentifully according to the measure of his estate, is
   still behindhand according to the measure of his sins. Let him pray to
   God that this late oblation may be accepted; and so it will, if it
   sails to him in a sea of penitential tears or sorrows that it is so
   little, and that is is so late.

   6. Let the sick man's charity be so ordered that it may not come only
   to deck the funeral and make up the pomp; charity waiting like one of
   the solemn mourners; but let it be continued, that, besides the alms of
   health and sickness, there may be a rejoicing in God for his charity
   long after his funeral, so as to become more beneficial and less
   public; that the poor may pray in private, and give God thanks many
   days together. This is matter of prudence, and yet in this we are to
   observe the same regards which we had in the charity and alms of our
   lives; with this only difference, that, in the funeral alms also of
   rich and able persons, the public customs of the church are to be
   observed, and decency and solemnity, and the expectations of the poor,
   and matter of public opinion, and the reputation of religion; in all
   other cases let thy charity consult with humility and prudence, that it
   never minister at all to vanity, but be as full of advantage and
   usefulness as it may.

   7. Every man will forgive a dying person; and therefore let the sick
   man be ready and sure, if he can, to send to such persons whom he hath
   injured, and beg their pardon, and do them right; for in this case he
   cannot stay for an opportunity of convenient and advantageous
   reconcilement; he cannot then spin out a treaty, nor beat down the
   price of composition, nor lay a snare to be quit from the obligation
   and coercion of laws; but he must ask forgiveness downright, and make
   him amends as he can, being greedy of making use of this opportunity of
   doing a duty that must be done, but cannot any more, if not now, until
   time returns again and tells the minutes backwards, so that yesterday
   shall be reckoned in the portions of the future.

   8. In the intervals of sharper pains, when the sick man amasses
   together all the arguments of comfort and testimonies of God's love to
   him and care of him, he must needs find infinite matter of thanksgiving
   and glorification of God; and it is a proper act of charity and love to
   God, and justice too, that he do honour to God on his death-bed for all
   the blessings of his life, not only in general communications, but
   those by which he hath been separate and discerned from others, or
   supported and blessed in his own person; such as are, "In all my
   life-time I never broke a home; I never fell into the hands of robbers,
   never into public shame, nor into noisome diseases; I have not begged
   my bread, nor been tempted by great and unequal fortunes: God gave me a
   good understanding, good friends, or delivered me in such a danger, and
   heard my prayers in such particular pressures of my spirit." This or
   like enumeration and consequent acts of thanksgiving are apt to produce
   love to God, and confidence in the day of trial; for he that gave me
   blessings in proportion to the state and capacities of my life, I hope
   also will do so in proportion to the needs of my sickness and my
   death-bed. This we find practised, as a most reasonable piece of piety,
   by the wisest of the heathens. So Antipater Tarsensis gave God thanks
   for his prosperous voyage into Greece; and Cyrus made a handsome prayer
   upon the tops of the mountains when, by a phantasm, he was warned of
   his approaching death. "Receive, O God my Father, these holy rites, by
   which I put an end to many and great affairs; and I give thee thanks
   for thy celestial signs and prophetic notices, whereby thou hast
   signified to me what I ought to do, and what I ought not. I present
   also very great thanks that I have perceived and acknowledged your care
   of me, and have never exalted myself above my condition, for any
   prosperour accident. And I pray that you will grant felicity to my
   wife, my children, and friends, and to me a death such as my life hath
   been." But that of Philagrius, in Gregory Nazianzen, is eucharistical,
   but it relates more especially to the blessings and advantages which
   are accidentally consequent to sickness. "I thank thee, O Father and
   maker of all my children, that thou art pleased to bless and to
   sanctify us even against our wills, and by the outward man purgest the
   inward, and leadest us through cross-ways to a blessed ending, for
   reasons best known unto thee." However, when we go from our hospital
   and place of little intermedial rest in our journey to heaven, it is
   fit that we give thanks to the major-domo for our entertainment. When
   these parts of religion are finished according to each man's necessity,
   there is nothing remaining of personal duty to be done alone, but that
   the sick man act over these virtues by the renewings of devotion and in
   the way of prayer; and that is to be continued as long as life, and
   voice, and reason dwell with us.

  SECTION X.

    Acts of Charity, by way of Prayer and Ejaculation; which may also be used
    for Thanksgiving in case of Recovery.

   O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord; my goodness
   extendeth not to thee, but to the saints that are in the earth, and to
   the excellent, in whom is all my delight. The Lord is the portion of my
   inheritance and of my cup; thou maintainest my lot. Psalm xvi. 2, 3, 5.

   As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried; he is a
   buckler to all those that trust in him. For who is God, except the
   Lord? or who is a rock, save our God? It is God that girdeth me with
   strength, and maketh my way perfect. Psalm xviii.30-32.

   Be not thou far from me, O Lord; O my strength, haste thee to help me.
   Psalm xxii. 19.

   Deliver my soul from the sword, my darling from the power of the dog.
   Save me from the lion's mouth; and thou hast heard me also from among
   the horns of the unicorns. Ver. 20, 21.

   I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the
   congregation will I praise thee. Ver. 22.

   Ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord; ye sons of God, glorify him,
   and fear before him, all ye sons of men. For he hath not despised nor
   abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath he hid his face
   from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. Ver. 23, 24.

   As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so longeth my soul after
   thee, O God. Psalm xlii. 1.

   My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God; when shall I come and
   appear before the Lord? Ver. 2.

   O my God, my soul is cast down within me. All thy waves and billows are
   gone over me. As with a sword in my bones, I am reproached. Yet the
   Lord will command his loving-kindness in the day-time; and in the night
   his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. Ver.
   6-8, 10.

   Bless ye the Lord in the congregations; even the Lord from the
   fountains of Israel. Psalm lxviii. 26.

   My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the
   day; for I know not the numbers thereof. Psalm lxxxi. 15.

   I will go in the strength of the Lord God; I will make mention of thy
   righteousness, even of thine only. O God, thou hast taught me from my
   youth; and hitherto have I declared thy wonderous works. But I will
   hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more. Ver. 16, 17,
   14.

   Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, who hast done great things. O
   God, who is like unto thee? Thou which hast showed me great and sore
   troubles shall quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the
   depths of the earth. Ver. 19, 20.

   Thou shalt increase thy goodness towards me, and comfort me on every
   side. Ver. 21.

   My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul which
   thou hast redeemed. Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who
   only doth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever;
   and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, Amen. Ver. 23,
   Psalm lxxii. 18, 19.

   I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplication. The
   sorrows of death compassed me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called
   I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
   Gracious is the Lord and righteous; yea our God is merciful. Psalm
   cxvi. 1, 3-5.

   The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low and he helped me.
   Return to thy rest, O my soul: the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me.
   For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and
   my feet from falling. Ver. 6-8.

   Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. O Lord,
   truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid:
   thou shalt loose my bonds. Ver. 15, 16.

   He that loveth not the Lord Jesus, let him be accursed. 1 Cor. xvi. 22.

   O that I might love thee as well as ever any creature loved thee! He
   that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God. There is no fear in love. 1
   John, iv. 16, 18.

   The Prayer.

   O most gracious and eternal God and loving Father, who hast poured out
   thy bowels upon us, and sent the Son of thy love unto us to die for
   love, and to make us dwell in love, and the eternal comprehensions of
   thy Divine mercies, O be pleased to inflame my heart with a holy
   charity towards thee and all the world. Lord, I forgive all that ever
   have offended me, and beg that both they and I may enter into the
   possession of thy mercies, and feel a gracious pardon from the same
   fountain of grace: and do thou forgive me all the acts of scandal
   whereby I have provoked, or tempted, or lessened, or disturbed any
   person. Lord, let me never have my portion amongst those that divide
   the union, and disturb the peace, and break the charities of the church
   and Christian communion. And though I am fallen into evil times, in
   which Christendom is divided by the names of an evil division, yet I am
   in charity with all Christians, with all that love the Lord Jesus and
   long for his coming; and I would give my life to save the soul of any
   of my brethren; and I humbly beg of thee that the public calamity of
   the several societies of the church may not be imputed to my soul to
   any evil purposes.

    II.

   Lord, preserve me in the unity of thy holy church, in the love of God
   and of my neighbours. Let thy grace enlarge my heart to remember,
   deeply to resent, faithfully to use, wisely to improve, and humbly to
   give thanks to thee for all thy favours with which thou hast enriched
   my soul, and supported my estate, and preserved my person, and rescued
   me from danger, and invited me to goodness in all the days and periods
   of my life. Thou hast led me through it with an excellent conduct; and
   I have gone astray after the manner of men; but my heart is towards
   thee. O, do unto thy servant as thou usest to do unto those that love
   thy name; let thy truth comfort me; thy mercy deliver me; thy staff
   support me; thy grace sanctify my sorrow; and thy goodness pardon all
   my sins: thy angels guide me with safety in this shadow of death, and
   thy most Holy Spirit lead me into the land of righteousness, for thy
   name's sake, which is so comfortable, and for Jesus Christ's sake, our
   dearest Lord and most gracious Saviour. Amen.

OF VISITATION OF THE SICK: OR THE ASSISTANCE THAT IS TO BE DONE TO DYING PERSONS
BY THE MINISTRY OF THEIR CLERGY-GUIDES.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I.

   God, who hath made no new covenant with dying persons distinct from the
   covenant of the living, hath also appointed no distinct sacraments for
   them, no other manner of usages but such as are common to all the
   spiritual necessities of living and healthful persons. In all the days
   of our religion, from our baptism to the resignation and delivery of
   our soul, God hath appointed his servants to minister to the
   necessities, and eternally to bless, and prudently to guide, and wisely
   to judge, concerning souls; and the Holy Ghost, that anointing from
   above, descends upon us in several effluxes, but ever by the ministries
   of the church. Our heads are anointed with that sacred unction,
   baptism, (not in ceremony, but in real and proper effect,) our
   foreheads in confirmation, our hands in ordinations, all our senses in
   the visitation of the sick; and all by the ministry of especially
   deputed and instructed persons: and we, who all our life-time derive
   blessings from the fountains of grace by the channels of ecclesiastical
   ministries, must do it then especially, when our needs are most pungent
   and actual. 1. We cannot give up our names to Christ, but the holy man
   that ministers in religion must enrol them, and present the persons and
   consign the grace: when we beg for God's Spirit the minister can best
   present our prayers, and by his advocation hallow our private desires
   and turn them into public and potent offices. 2. If we desire to be
   established and confirmed in the grace and religion of our baptism, the
   holy man whose hands are anointed by a special ordination to that and
   its symbolical purposes, lays his hands upon the catechumen, and the
   anointing from above descends by that ministry. 3. If we would eat the
   body and drink the blood of our Lord, we must address ourselves to the
   Lord's table, and he that stands there to bless and to minister can
   reach it forth and feed thy soul; and without his ministry thou canst
   not be nourished with that heavenly feast, nor thy body consigned to
   immortality, nor thy soul refreshed with the sacramental bread from
   heaven, except by spiritual suppletories in cases of necessity and an
   impossible communion. 4. If we have committed sins, the spiritual man
   is appointed to restore us, and to pray for us, and to receive our
   confessions, and to inquire into our wounds, and to infuse oil and
   remedy, and to pronounce pardon. 5. If we be cut off from the communion
   of the faithful by our own demerits, their holy hands must reconcile us
   and give us peace; they are our appointed comforters, our instructors,
   our ordinary judges; and, in the whole, what the children of Israel
   begged of Moses, [148] - that God would no more speak to them alone,
   but by his servant Moses, lest they should be consumed - God, in
   compliance with our infirmities, hath of his own goodness established
   as a perpetual law in all ages of Christianity, that God will speak to
   us by his ministers, and our solemn prayers shall be made to him by
   their advocation, and his blessings descend from heaven by their hands,
   and our offices return thither by their presidencies, and our
   repentance shall be managed by them, and our pardon in many degrees
   ministered by them: God comforts us by their sermons, and reproves us
   by their discipline, and cuts off some by their severity, and
   reconciles others by their gentleness, and relieves us by their
   prayers, and instructs us by their discourses, and heals our sicknesses
   by their intercession presented to God, and united to Christ's
   advocation: and in all this they are no causes but servants of the will
   of God, instruments of the divine grace and order, stewards and
   dispensers of the mysteries, and appointed to our souls to serve and
   lead, and to help in all accidents, dangers, and necessities.

   And they who received us in our baptism are also to carry us to our
   grave, and to take care that our end be as our life was or should have
   been; and therefore it is established as an apostolical rule, Is any
   man sick among you? let him send for the elders of the church, and let
   them pray over him, [149] etc.

   The sum of the duties and offices respectively implied in these words
   is in the following rules.

  SECTION II.

    Rules for the Manner of Visitation of Sick Persons.

   1. Let the minister of religion be sent to, not only against the agony
   or death, but be advised with in the whole conduct of the sickness; for
   in sickness indefinitely, and therefore in every sickness, and
   therefore in such which are not mortal, which end in health, which have
   no agony or final temptations, St. James gives the advice; and the sick
   man, being bound to require them, is also tied to do it, when he can
   know them and his own necessity. It is a very great evil both in the
   matter of prudence and piety that they fear the priest as they fear the
   embalmer or the sexton's spade; and love not to converse with him
   unless they can converse with no man else; and think his office so much
   to relate to the other world that he is not to be treated with while we
   hope to live in this; and, indeed, that our religion be taken care of
   only when we die: and the event is this, (of which I have seen some sad
   experience,) that the man is deadly sick, and his reason is useless,
   and he is laid to sleep, and his life is in the confines of the grave,
   so that he can do nothing towards the trimming of his lamp; and the
   curate shall say a few prayers by him, and talk to a dead man, and the
   man is not in a condition to be helped but in a condition to need it
   hugely. He cannot be called upon to confess his sins, and he is not
   able to remember them, and he cannot understand an advice, nor hear a
   free discourse, nor be altered from a passion, nor cured of his fear,
   nor comforted upon any grounds of reason or religion, and no man can
   tell what is likely to be his fate; or, if he does, he cannot prophesy
   good things concerning him, but evil. Let the spiritual man come when
   the sick man can be conversed withal and instructed, when he can take
   medicine and amend, when he understands or can be taught to understand
   the case of his soul, and the rules of his conscience; and then his
   advice may turn into advantage; it cannot otherwise be useful.

   2.The intercourses of the minister with the sick man have so much
   variety in them that they are not to be transacted at once; and
   therefore they do not well that send once to see the good man with
   sorrow, and hear him pray and thank him, and dismiss him civilly, and
   desire to see his face no more. To dress a soul for funeral is not a
   work to be dispatched at one meeting: at first he needs a comfort, and
   anon something to make him willing to die; and by and by he is tempted
   to impatience, and that needs a special cure; and it is a great work to
   make his confessions well and with advantages; and it may be the man is
   careless and indifferent, and then he needs to understand the evil of
   his sin, and the danger of his person; and his cases of conscience may
   be so many and so intricate that he is not quickly to be reduced to
   peace, and one time the holy man must pray, and another time he must
   exhort, a third time administer the holy sacrament; and he that ought
   to watch all the periods and little portions of his life, lest he
   should be surprised and overcome, had need be watched when he is sick,
   and assisted and called upon and reminded of the several parts of his
   duty in every instant of his temptation. This article was well provided
   for among the easterlings; for the priests in their visitations, of a
   sick person did abide in their attendance and ministry for seven days
   together. The want of this makes the visitations fruitless, and the
   calling of the clergy contemptible, while it is not suffered to imprint
   its proper effects upon them that need it in a lasting ministry.

   3. St. James advises that when a man is sick he should send for the
   elders; [150] one sick man for many presbyters; and so did the eastern
   churches, [151] they sent for seven; and like a college of physicians
   they ministered spiritual remedies, and sent up prayers like a choir of
   singing clerks. In cities they might do so while the Christians were
   few and the priests many. But when they that dwelt in the pagi, or
   villages, ceased to be Pagans, and were baptized, it grew to be an
   impossible felicity, unless in few cases, and to some more eminent
   persons: but because they need it most God hath taken care that they
   may best have it; and they that can are not very prudent if they
   neglect it.

   4. Whether they be many or few that are sent to the sick person, let
   the curate of his parish, or his own confessor, be amongst them; that
   is, let him not be wholly advised by strangers who know not his
   particular necessities; but he that is the ordinary judge cannot safely
   be passed by in his extraordinary necessity, which in so great portions
   depends upon his whole life past: and it is a matter of suspicion, when
   we decline his judgment that knows us best, and with whom we formerly
   did converse either by choice or by law, by private election or public
   constitution. It concerns us then to make severe and profitable
   judgments, and not to conspire against ourselves, or procure such
   assistances which may handle us softly, or comply with our weaknesses
   more than relieve our necessities.

   5. When the ministers of religion are come, first let them do their
   ordinary offices, that is, pray for grace to the sick man for patience,
   for resignation, for health, (if it seems good to God in order to his
   great ends.) For that is one of the ends of the advice of the apostle.
   And therefore the minister is to be sent for not while the case is
   desperate, but before the sickness is come to its crisis or period. Let
   him discourse concerning the causes of sickness, and by a general
   instrument move him to consider concerning his condition. Let him call
   upon him to set his soul in order; to trim his lamp; to dress his soul;
   to renew acts of grace by way of prayer; to make amends in all the
   evils he hath done; and to supply all the defects of duty as much as
   his past condition requires, and his present can admit.

   6. According as the condition of the sickness or the weakness of the
   man is observed, so the exhortation is to be less, and the prayers
   more, because the life of the man was his main preparatory; and,
   therefore, if his condition be full of pain and infirmity, the
   shortness and small number of his own acts is to be supplied by the
   acts of the ministers and standers-by, who are in such case to speak
   more to God for him than to talk to him. For the prayer of the
   righteous, [152] when it is fervent, hath a promise to prevail much in
   behalf the sick person. But exhortations must prevail with their own
   proper weight, not by the passion of the speaker. But yet this
   assistance by way of prayers is not to be done by long offices, but by
   frequent and fervent and holy; in which offices, if the sick man joins,
   let them be short and apt to comply with his little strength and great
   infirmities: if they be said in his behalf without his conjunction,
   they that pray may prudently use their liberty, and take no measures
   but their own devotions and opportunities, and the sick man's
   necessities.

   When he hath made this general address and preparatory entrance to the
   work of many days and periods, he may descend to particulars by the
   following instruments and discourses.

  SECTION III.

    Of ministering in the Sick Mans Confession of Sins and Repentance.

   The first necessity that is to be served is that of repentance, in
   which the ministers can in no way serve him but by first exhorting him
   to confession of his sins, and declaration of the state of his soul.
   For unless they know the manner of his life, and the degrees of his
   restitution, either they can do nothing at all, or nothing of advantage
   and certainty. His discourses, like Jonathan's arrows, may shoot short
   or shoot over, but not wound where they should, nor open those humours
   that need a lancet or a cautery. To this purpose the sick man may be
   reminded:--

   Arguments and Exhortations to move the Sick Man to Confession of Sins.

   1. That God hath made a special promise to confession of sins. He that
   confesseth his sins, and forsaketh them, shall have mercy;' and If we
   confess our sins, God is righteous to forgive us our sins, and to
   cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' [153] 2. That confession of sins
   is a proper act and introduction to repentance. 3. That when the Jews,
   being warned by the sermons of the Baptist, repented of their sins,
   they confessed their sins to John in the susception of baptism. [154]
   4. That the converts in the days of the apostles, returning to
   Christianity, instantly declared their faith and their repentance by
   confession and declaration of their deeds, [155] which they then
   renounced, abjured, and confessed to the apostles. 5. That confession
   is an act of many virtues together. 6. It is the gate of repentance. 7.
   An instrument of shame and condemnation of our sins. 8. A glorification
   of God, so called by Joshua, particularly in the case of Achan. 9. An
   acknowledgment that God is just in punishing; for by confessing of our
   sins we also confess his justice, and are assessors with God in this
   condemnation of ourselves. 10. That by such an act of judging
   ourselves, we escape the more angry judgment of God; St. Paul expressly
   exhorting us to it upon that very inducement. [156] 11. That confession
   of sins is so necessary a duty, that, in all Scriptures, it is the
   immediate preface to pardon, and the certain consequence of godly
   sorrow, and an integral or constituent part of that grace which,
   together with faith, makes up the whole duty of the gospel. 12. That in
   all ages of the gospel it hath been taught and practised respectively,
   that all the penitents made confessions proportionable to their
   repentance, that is, public or private, general or particular. 13. That
   God, by testimonies from heaven, that is by his word, and by a
   consequent rare peace of conscience, hath given approbation to this
   holy duty. 14. That by this instrument those whose office it is to
   apply remedies to every spiritual sickness can best perform their
   offices. 15. That it is by all churches esteemed a duty necessary to be
   done in cases of a troubled conscience. 16. That what is necessary to
   be done in one case, and convenient in all cases, is fit to be done by
   all persons. 17. That without confession it cannot easily be judged
   concerning the sick person whether his conscience ought to be troubled
   or no, and therefore it cannot be certain that it is not necessary. 18.
   That there can be no reason against it, but such as consults with flesh
   and blood, with infirmity and sin, to all which confession of sins is a
   direct enemy. 19. That now is that time when all the imperfections of
   his repentance and all the breaches of his duty are to be made up, and
   that if he omits this opportunity he can never be admitted to a
   salutary and medicinal confession. 20. That St. James gives an express
   precept that we Christians should confess our sins to each other, [157]
   that is, Christian to Christian, brother to brother, the people to
   their minister; and then he makes a specification of that duty which a
   sick man is to do when he hath sent for the elders of the church. 21.
   That in all this there is no more lies upon him; but if he hides his
   sins he shall not be directed,' so said the wise man; but ere long he
   must appear before the great Judge of men and angels; and his spirit
   will be more amazed and confounded to be seen among the angels of light
   with the shadows of the works of darkness upon him, than he can suffer
   by confessing to God in the presence of him whom God hath sent to heal
   him. However, it is better to be ashames here than to be confounded
   hereafter. "Polpudere praestat quam pigere, totidem literis." [158] 22.
   That confession being in order to pardon of sins, it is very proper and
   analogical to the nature of the thing that it be made there where the
   pardon of sins is to be administered; and that of pardon of sins God
   hath made the minister the publisher and dispenser; and all this is
   besides the accidental advantages which accrue to the conscience, which
   is made ashamed and timorous, and restrained by the mortifications and
   blushings of discovering to a man the faults committed in secret. 23.
   That the ministers of the gospel are the ministers of reconciliation,
   are commanded to restore such persons as are overtaken in a fault; and
   to that purpose they come to offer their ministry, if they may have
   cognizance of the fault and person. 24. That in the matter of prudence
   it is not safe to trust a man's self in the final condition and last
   security of a man's soul, a man being no good judge of his own case.
   And when a duty is so useful to all cases, so necessary in some, and
   encouraged by promises evangelical, by Scripture precedents, by the
   example of both Testaments, and prescribed by injunctions apostolical,
   and by the canon of all churches, and the example of all ages, and
   taught us even by the proportions of duty, and the analogy to the power
   of ministerial, and the very necessities of every man; he that for
   stubbornness or sinful shamefacedness, or prejudice, or any other
   criminal weakness, shall decline to do it in the days of his danger,
   when the vanities of the world are worn off, and all affections to sin
   are wearied, and the sin itself is pungent and grievous, and that we
   are certain we shall not escape shame for them hereinafter, unless we
   be ashamed of them here, [159] and use all the proper instruments of
   their pardon; this man, I say, is very near death, but very far off
   from the kingdom of heaven.

   2. The spiritual man will find in the conduct of this duty many cases
   and varieties of accidents which will alter his course and forms of
   proceedings. Most men are of a rude indifferency, apt to excuse
   themselves, ignorant of their condition abused by evil principles,
   content with a general and indefinite confession; and, if you provoke
   them to it by the forgoing considerations, lest their spirits should be
   a little uneasy, or not secured in their own opinions, will be apt to
   say they are sinners, as every man hath his infirmity, and he as well
   as any man: but, God be thanked, they bear no ill-will to any man, or
   are no adulterers, or no rebels, or they have fought on the right side;
   and God be merciful to them, for they are sinners. But you shall hardly
   open their breasts further; and to inquire beyond this would be to do
   the office of an accuser.

   3. But which is yet worse, there are very many persons who have been so
   used to an habitual course of a constant intemperance, or dissolution
   in any other instance, that the crime is made natural and necessary,
   and the conscience hath digested all the trouble, and the man thinks
   himself to a good estate, and never reckons any sins but those which
   are the egressions and passings beyond his ordinary and daily
   drunkenness. This happens in the case of drunkenness and intemperate
   eating and idleness and uncharitableness, and in lying and vain
   jestings, and particularly in such evils which the laws do not punish,
   and public customs do not shame, but which are countenanced by potent
   sinners, or evil customs, or good nature and mistaken civilities.

   Instruments by way of Consideration, to awaken a careless Person, and a
   stupid Conscience.

   In these and the like cases the spiritual man must awaken the lethargy,
   and prick the conscience, by representing to him, 1. That Christianity
   is a holy and a strict religion. 2. That many are called, but few are
   chosen. That the number of them that are to be saved is but a very few
   in respect of those that are to descent into sorrow and everlasting
   darkness. That we have covenanted with God in baptism to live a holy
   life. That the measures of holiness in the Christian religion are not
   to be taken by the evil proportions of the multitude and common fame of
   looser and less severe persons; because the multitude is that which
   does not enter into heaven, but the few, the elect, the holy servants
   of Jesus. That every habitual sin does amount to a very great guilt in
   the whole, though it be but in a small instance. That if the righteous
   scarcely be saved, then there will be no place for the unrighteous and
   the sinner to appear in but places of horrow and amazement. That
   confidence hath destroyed many souls, and many have had a sad portion
   who have reckoned themselves in the calendar of saints. That the
   promises of heaven are so great that it is not reasonable to think that
   every man and every life and an easy religion shall possess such
   infinite glories. That although heaven is a gift, yet there is a great
   severity and strict exacting of the conditions on our part to receive
   that gift. That some persons who have lived strictly for forty years
   together, yet have misearned by some one crime at last, or some secret
   hypocrisy, or a latent pride, or a creeping ambition, or a fantastic
   spirit; and therefore much less can they hope to receive so great
   portions of felicities, when their life hath been a continual
   declination from those severities which might have created confidence
   of pardon and acceptation through the mercies of God and the merits of
   Jesus. That every good man ought to be suspicious of himself, and in
   his judgment concerning his own condition to fear the worst that he may
   provide for the better. That we are commanded to work our out salvation
   with fear and trembling. That this precept was given with great reason,
   considering the thousand thousand ways of miscarrying. That St. Paul
   himself, and St. Arenius and St. Elzearius and divers other remarkable
   saints, had at some times great apprehensions of the dangers of failing
   of the mighty price of their high calling. That the stake that is to be
   secured is of so great an interest that all our industry and all the
   violatences we can suffer in the prosecution of it are not
   considerable. That this affair is to be done but once, and then never
   any more unto eternal ages. That they who profess themselves servants
   of the institution, and servants of the law and discipline of Jesus,
   will find that they must judge themselves by the proportions of that
   law by which they were to rule themselves. That the laws of society and
   civility, and the voices of my company are as ill judges as they are
   guides; but we are to stand or fall by his sentence who will not
   consider or value the talk of idle men or the persuasion of
   wilfully-abused consciences, but of him who hath felt our infirmity in
   all things but sin, and knows where our failings are unavoidable, and
   where, and in what degree they are excusable; but never will endure a
   sin should seize upon any part of our love and deliberate choice or
   careless cohabitation. That if our conscience accuse us not, yet are we
   not hereby justified; for God is greater than our consciences. That
   they who are most innocent have their consciences most tender and
   sensible. That scrupulous persons are always most religious; and that
   to feel nothing is not a sign of life, but of death. That nothing can
   be hid from the eyes of the Lord, to whom the day and the night, public
   and private, words and thoughts, actions and desires, are equally
   discernible. That a lukewarm person is only secured in his own
   thoughts, but very unsafe in the event, and despised by God. That we
   live in an age in which that which is called and esteemed a holy life,
   in the days of the apostles and holy primitives would have been
   esteemed indifferent, sometimes scandalous, and always cold. That what
   was a truth of God then is so now; and to what severities they were
   tied, for the same also we are to be accountable; and heaven is not now
   an easier purchase than it was then. That if he will cast up his
   accounts, even with a superficial eye, let him consider how few good
   works he hath done; how inconsiderable is the relief which he gave to
   the poor; how little are the extraordinaries of his religion; and how
   inactive and lame, how polluted and disordered, how unchosen and
   unpleasant were the ordinary parts and periods of it; and how many and
   great sins have stained his course of life; and till he enters into a
   particular scrutiny, let him only revolve in his mind what his general
   course hath been; and, in the way of prudence, let him say whether it
   was landable and holy or only indifferent and excusable; and if he can
   think it only excusable, and so as to hope for pardon by such
   suppletories of faith and arts of persuasion which he and others used
   to take in for auxiliaries to their unreasonable confidence, then he
   cannot but think it very fit that he search into his own state, and
   take a guide, and erect a tribunal, or appear before that which Christ
   hath erected for him on earth, that he may make his access fairer when
   he shall be called before the dreadful tribunal of Christ in the
   clouds. [160] For if he can be confident upon the stock of an unpraised
   or a looser life, and should dare to venture upon wild accounts,
   without order, without abatements, without consideration, without
   conduct, without fear, without scrutinies and confessions and
   instruments of amends or pardon, he either knows not his danger or
   cares not for it, and little understands how great a horror that is
   that a man should rest his head for ever upon a cradle of flames, and
   lie in a bed of sorrows, and never sleep, and never end his groans or
   the gnashing of his teeth.

   This is that which some spiritual persons call a wakening of the sinner
   by the terrors of the law, which is a good analogy or tropical
   expression to represent the threatenings of the Gospel, and the dangers
   of an incurious and a sinning person; but we have nothing else to do
   with the terrors of the law, for, blessed be God, they concern us not.
   The terrors of the law were the intermination of curses upon all those
   that ever broke any of the least commandments once or in any instance;
   and to it the righteousness of faith is opposed. The terrors of the law
   admitted no repentance, no pardon, no abatement, and were so severe
   that God never inflicted them at all according to the letter, because
   he admitted all to repentance that desired it with a timely prayer,
   unless in very few cases, as of Achan, or Korah the gatherer of sticks
   upon the Sabbath day, or the like; but the state of threatenings in the
   Gospel is very fearful, because the conditions of avoiding them are
   easy and ready, and they happen to evil persons after many warnings,
   second thoughts, frequent invitations to pardon and repentance, and
   after one entire pardon consigned in baptism. And in this sense it is
   necessary that such persons as we now deal withal should be instructed
   concerning their danger.

   4. When the sick man is, either of himself or by these considerations,
   set forward with purposes of repentance and confession of his sins, in
   order to all its holy purposes and effects then the minister is to
   assist him in the understanding the number of his sins, that is, the
   several kinds of them, and the various manners of prevaricating the
   divine commandments: for, as for the number of the particulars in every
   kind, he will need less help; and if he did he can have it nowhere but
   in his own conscience and from the witnesses of his conversation. Let
   this be done by prudent insinuation, by arts of remembrance, and secret
   notices, and propounding occasions and instruments of recalling such
   things to his mind, which either by public fame he is accused of, or by
   the temptations of his condition it is likely he might have contracted.

   5. If the person be truly penitent, and forward to confess all that are
   set before him, or offered to his sight at a half face, then he may be
   complied withal in all his innocent circumstances, and his conscience
   made placid and willing, and he be drawn forward by good-nature and
   civility, that his repentance in all the parts of it, and in every step
   of its progress and emanation, may be as voluntary and chosen as it
   can. For by that means, if the sick person can be invited to do the
   work of religion, it enters by the door of his will and choice, and
   will pass on toward consummation by the instrument of delight.

   6. If the sick man be backward and without apprehension of the
   good-natured and civil way, let the minister take care that by some way
   or other the work of God be secured; and if he will not understand when
   he is secretly prompted, he must be hallowed to, and asked in plain
   interrogatives concerning the crime of his life. He must be told of the
   evil things that are spoken of him in markets and exchanges, the proper
   temptations and accustomed evils of his calling and condition, of the
   actions of scandal; and in all those actions which are public, or of
   which any notice is come abroad, let care be taken that the right side
   of the case of conscience be turned toward him, and the error truly
   represented to him by which he was abused, as the injustice of his
   contracts, his oppressive bargains, his rapine and violence; and if he
   hath persuaded himself to think well of a scandalous action, let him be
   instructed and advertised of his folly and his danger.

   7. And this advice concerns the minister of religion to follow without
   partiality, or fear, or interest, in much simplicity, and prudence, and
   hearty sincerity; having no other consideration but that the interest
   of the man's soul be preserved, and no caution used but that the matter
   be represented with just circumstances and civilities, fitted to the
   person with prefaces of honour and regard; but so that nothing of the
   duty be diminished by it, that the introduction do not spoil the
   sermon, and both together ruin two souls, of the speaker and the
   hearer. For it may soon be considered, if the sick man be a poor or an
   indifferent person in secular account, yet his soul is equally dear to
   God, and was redeemed with the same highest price, and therefore to be
   highly regarded; and there is no temptation but that the spiritual man
   may speak freely without the allays of interest, or fear, or mistaken
   civilities. But if the sick man be a prince, or a person of eminence or
   wealth, let it be remembered it is an ill expression of reverence to
   his authority, or of regard to his person, to let him perish for the
   want of an honest, and just, and free homily.

   8. Let the sick man, in the scrutiny of his conscience and confession
   of his sins, be carefully reminded to consider those sins which are
   only condemned in the court of conscience, and nowhere else. For there
   are certain secresies and retirements, places of darkness and
   artificial veils, with which the devil uses to hide our sins from us,
   and to incorporate them into our affections by a constant uninterrupted
   practice before they be prejudiced or discovered. 1. There are many
   sins which have reputation and are accounted honour; as fighting a
   duel, answering a blow with a blow, carrying armies into a
   neighbour-country, robbing with a navy, violently seizing upon a
   kingdom. 2. Others are permitted by law, as usury in all countries; and
   because every excuse of it is a certain sin, the permission of so
   suspected a matter makes it ready for us, and instructs the temptation.
   3. Some things are not forbidden by laws, as lying in ordinary
   discourse, jeering, scoffing, intemperate eating, ingratitude, selling
   too high, circumventing another in contracts, importunate entreaties,
   and temptation of persons to many instances of sin, pride, and
   ambition. 4. Some others do not reckon they sin against God if the laws
   have seized upon the person; and many that are imprisoned for debt
   think themselves disobliged from payment, and when they pay the penalty
   think they owe nothing for the scandal and disobedience. 5. Some sins
   are thought not considerable, but go under the title of sins of
   infirmity, or inseparable accidents of mortality; such as idle
   thoughts, foolish talking, looser revellings, impatience, anger, and
   all the events of evil company. 6. Lastly, many things are thought to
   be no sins; such as mispending of their time, whole days or months of
   useless and impertinent employment, long gaming, winning men's money in
   greater portions, censuring men's actions, curiosity, equivocating in
   the prices and secrets of buying and selling, rudeness, speaking truths
   enviously, doing good to evil purposes, and the like. Under the dark
   shadow of these unhappy and fruitless yew-trees the enemy of mankind
   makes very many to lie hid from themselves, sewing before their
   nakedness the fig-leaves of popular and idol reputation and impunity,
   public permission, a temporal penalty, infirmity, prejudice, and direct
   error in judgment and ignorance. Now in all these cases the ministers
   are to be inquisitive and observant, lest the fallacy prevail upon the
   penitent to evil purposes of death or diminution of his good; and that
   those things, which in his life passed without observation, may now be
   brought forth, and pass under saws and harrows, that is, the severity
   and censure of sorrow and condemnation.

   9. To which I add, for the likeness of the thing, that the matters of
   omission be considered, for in them lies the bigger half of our
   failings; and yet, in many instances, they are undiscerned, because
   they very often sit down by the conscience but never upon it; and they
   are usually looked upon as poor men's do upon their not having coach
   and horses, or as that knowledge is missed by boys and hinds which they
   never had; it will be hard to make them understand their ignorance - it
   requires knowledge to perceive it, and therefore he that can perceive
   it hath it not. But by this pressing the conscience with omissions, I
   do not mean recessions or distances from states of eminency or
   perfection; for although they may be used by the ministers as an
   instrument of humility, and a chastiser of too big a confidence, yet
   that which is to be confessed and repented of is omission of duty in
   direct instances and matters of commandment, or collateral and personal
   obligations, and is especially to be considered by kings and prelates,
   by governors and rich persons, by guides of souls and presidents of
   learning in public charge, and by all other in their proportions.

   10. The ministers of religion must take care that the sick man's
   confession be as minute and particular as it can, and that as few sins
   as may be, be entrusted to the general prayer of pardon for all sins;
   for by being particular and enumerative of the variety of evils which
   have disordered his life, his repentance is disposed to be more pungent
   and afflictive, and therefore more salutary and medicinal; it hath in
   it more sincerity, and makes a better judgment of the final condition
   of the man; and from thence it is certain the hopes of the sick man can
   be more confident and reasonable.

   11. The spiritual man that assists at the repentance of the sick must
   not be inquisitive into all the circumstances of the particular sins,
   but be content with those that are direct parts of the crime and
   aggravations of the sorrow; such as frequency, long abode, and earnest
   choice in acting them; violent desires, great expense, scandal of
   others, dishonour to the religion, days of devotion, religious
   solemnities, and holy places; and the degrees of boldness and
   impudence, perfect resolution, and the habit. If the sick person be
   reminded or inquired into concerning these, it may prove a good
   instrument to increase his contrition, and perfect his penitential
   sorrows, and facilitate his absolution and the means of his amendment.
   But the other circumstances, as of the relative person in the
   participation of the crime, the measures or circumstances of the impure
   action, the name of the injured man or woman, the quality or accidental
   condition; these and all the like are but questions springing from
   curiosity, and producing scruple, and apt to turn into many
   inconveniences.

   12. The minister in this duty of repentance must be diligent to observe
   concerning the person that repents, that he be not imposed upon by some
   one excellent thing that was remarkable in the sick man's former life.
   [161] For there are some people of one good thing. Some are charitable
   to the poor out of kind-heartedness; and the same good nature makes
   them easy and compliant with drinking persons; and they die with drink
   but cannot live with charity; and their alms, it may be, shall deck
   their monument, or give them the reward of loving persons, and the poor
   man's thanks for alms, and procure many temporal blessings; but it is
   very sad that the reward should be soon spent in this world. Some are
   rarely just persons and punctual observers of their word with men, but
   break their promises with God, and make no scruple of that. In these
   and all the like cases, the spiritual man must be careful to remark,
   that good proceeds from an entire and integral cause, and evil from
   every part; that one sickness can make a man die, but he cannot live
   and be called a sound man without an entire health; and therefore, if
   any confidence arises upon that stock, so as that it hinders the
   strictness of the repentance, it must be allayed with the representment
   of this sad truth "that he who reserves one evil in his choice hath
   chosen an evil portion," and coloquintida and death is in the pot; and
   he that worships the God of Israel with a frequent sacrifice, and yet
   upon the anniversary will bow in the house of Venus, and loves to see
   the follies and the nakedness of Rimmon, may eat part of the flesh of
   the sacrifice and fill his belly, but shall not be refreshed by the
   holy cloud arising from the alter, or the dew of heaven descending upon
   the mysteries.

   13. And yet the minister is to estimate, that one or more good things
   is to be an ingredient into his judgment concerning the state of his
   soul, and the capacities of his restitution, and admission to the peace
   of the church; and according as the excellency and usefulness of the
   grace hath been, and according to the degrees and the reasons of its
   prosecution, so abatements are to be made in the injunctions and
   impositions upon the penitent. For every virtue is one degree of
   approach to God; and though in respect of the acceptation it is equally
   none at all, that is, it is as certain a death if a man dies with one
   mortal wound as if he had twenty: yet in such persons who have some one
   or more excellences, though not an entire piety, there is naturally a
   nearer approach to the estate of grace than in persons who have done
   evils and are eminent for nothing that is good. But in making judgment
   of such persons, it is to be inquired into and noted accordingly, why
   the sick person was so eminent in that one good thing; whether by
   choice and apprehension of his duty, or whether it was a virtue from
   which his state of life ministered nothing to dehort or discourse him,
   or whether it was only a consequent of his natural temper and
   constitution. If the first, then, it supposes him in the neighbourhood
   of the state of grace, and that in other things he was strongly
   tempted. The second is a felicity of his education, and an effect of
   Providence. The third is felicity of his nature, and a gift of God in
   order to spiritual purposes. But yet of every one of these advantages
   is to be made. If the conscience of his duty was the principle, then he
   is ready formed to entertain all other graces upon the same reason, and
   his repentance must be made more sharp and penal; because he is
   convinced to have done against his conscience in all the other parts of
   his life; but the judgment concerning his final state ought to be more
   gentle, because it was a huge temptation that hindered the man and
   abused his infirmity. But if either his calling or his nature were the
   parents of the grace, he is in the state of a moral man, (in the just
   and proper meaning of the word,) and to be handled accordingly; that
   virtue disposed him rarely well to many other good things, but was no
   part of the grace of sanctification; and therefore the man's repentance
   is to begin anew, for all that, and is to be finished in the returns of
   health, if God grants it; but if he denies it, it is much, very much,
   the worse for all that sweet-natured virtue.

   14. When the confession is made, the spiritual man is to execute the
   office of a restorer and a judge in the following particulars and
   manner.

  SECTION IV.

    Of the ministering to the Restitution and Pardon, or Reconciliation of the
    Sick Person, by Administering the Holy Sacrament.

   If any man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such
   a one in the spirit of meekness,' [162] that is the commission: and,
   Let the elders of the church pray over the sick man; and if he have
   committed sins they shall be forgiven him;' [163] that is the effect of
   his power and his ministry. But concerning this some few things are to
   be considered.

   1. It is the office of the presbyters and ministers of religion to
   declare public criminals and scandalous persons to be such, that, when
   the leprosy is declared, the flock may avoid the infection; and then
   the man is excommunicate, when the people are warned to avoid the
   danger of the man or the reproach of the crime, to withdraw from his
   society, and not to bid him God speed, not to eat and celebrate
   syntaxes and church-meetings with such who are declared criminal and
   dangerous. And therefore excommunication is, in a very great part, the
   act of the congregation and communities of the faithful: and St. Paul
   said to the church of the Corinthians, [164] that they had inflicted
   the evil upon the incestuous person, that is, by excommunicating him:
   all the acts of which are, as they are subjected in the people, acts of
   caution and liberty; but no more acts of direct proper power or
   jurisdiction than it was when the scholars of Simon Magus left his
   chair and went to hear St. Peter; but as they are actions of the rulers
   of the church, so they are declarative, ministerial, and effective too
   by moral causality; that is, by persuasion and discourse, by argument
   and prayer, by homily and material representment, by reasonableness of
   order and the superinduced necessities of men; though not by any real
   change of state as to the person, nor by diminution of his right, or
   violence to his condition.

   2. He that baptizes, and he that ministers the holy sacrament, and he
   that prays, does holy offices of great advantage; but in these also,
   just as in the former, he exercises no jurisdiction or pre-eminence
   after the manner of secular authority; [165] and the same is also true
   if he should deny them. He that refuseth to baptize an indisposed
   person hath, by the consent of all men, no power or jurisdiction over
   the unbaptized man; and he that, for the like reason, refuseth to give
   him the communion, preserves the sacredness of the mysteries, and does
   charity to the undisposed man, to deny that to him which will do him
   mischief: and this is an act of separation, just as it is for a friend
   or physician to deny water to an hydropic person, or Italian wines to a
   hectic fever, or as if Cato should deny to salute Bibulus, or the
   censor of manners to do countenance to a wanton and a vicious person.
   And though this thing was expressed by words of power, such as
   separation, abstention, excommunication, deposition; yet these words we
   understand by the thing itself, which was notorious and evident to be
   matter of prudence, security, and a free, unconstrained discipline; and
   they passed into power by consent and voluntary submission, having the
   same effect of constraint, fear, and authority, which we see in secular
   jurisdiction: not because ecclesiastical discipline hath a natural
   proper coercion as lay tribunals have, but because men have submitted
   to it, and are bound to do so upon the interest of two or three
   Christian graces.

   In pursuance of this caution and provision, the church superinduced
   times and manners of abstention, and expressions of sorrow, and
   canonical punishments, which they tied the delinquent people to suffer
   before they would admit them to the holy table of the Lord. For the
   criminal having obliged himself by his sin, and the church having
   declared it, when she should take notice of it, be is bound to repent,
   to make him capable of pardon with God; and to prove that he is
   penitent he is to do such actions which the church, in the virtue and
   pursuance of repentance, shall accept as a testimony of it sufficient
   to inform her; for as she could not bind at all (in this sense) till
   the crime was public, though the man had bound himself in secret; so
   neither can she set him free till the repentance be as public as the
   sin, or so as she can note it and approve it. Though the man be free,
   as to God, by his internal act, yet, as the publication of the sin was
   accidental to it, and the church-censure consequent to it, so is the
   publication of repentance and consequent absolution extrinsieal to the
   pardon, but accidentally and in the present circumstances necessary.
   This was the same that the Jews did, (though in other instances and
   expressions,) and do to this day to their prevaricating people; and the
   Essences in their assemblies, and private colleges of scholars, and
   public universities. For all these being assemblies of voluntary
   persons, and such as seek for advantage, are bound to make an
   artificial authority in their superiors, and so to secure order and
   government by their own obedience and voluntary subordination in the
   superior; and the band of it is not any coercitive power, but the deny
   to communicate such benefits which they seek in that communion and
   fellowship.

   4. These, I say, were introduced in the special manners and instances
   by positive authority, and have not a divine authority commanding them;
   but there is a divine power that verifies them and makes these
   separations effectual and formidable; for because they are declarative
   and ministerial in the spiritual man, and suppose a delinquency and
   demerit in the other, and a sin against God, our blessed Saviour hath
   declared that what they bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;' that
   is in plain signification, the same sins and sinners which the clergy
   condemn in the face of their assemblies, the same are condemned in
   heaven before the face of God, and for the same reason too. God's law
   hath sentenced it, and these are the preachers and publishers of his
   law by which they stand condemned; and these laws are they that condemn
   the sin or acquit the penitent there and here; whatsoever they bind
   here shall be bound there, that is, the sentence of God at the day of
   judgment shall sentence the same men [166] whom the church does rightly
   sentence here. It is spoken in the future, it shall be bound in heaven;
   not but that the sinner is first bound there or first absolved there;
   but because all binding and loosing in the interval is imperfect and
   relative to the day of judgment, the day of the great sentence,
   therefore it is set down in the time to come; and says this only, the
   clergy are tied by the word and laws of God to condemn such sins and
   sinners; and that you may not think it ineffective, because after such
   sentence the man lives and grows rich, or remains in health and power,
   therefore be sure it shall be verified in the day of judgment. This is
   hugely agreeable with the words of our Lord and certain in reason; for
   that the minister does nothing to the final alteration of the state of
   the man's soul by way of sentence, is demonstratively certain, because
   he cannot bind a man but such as hath bound himself and who is bound in
   heaven by his sin before his sentence in the church; as also because
   the binding of the church is merely accidental and upon publication
   only; and when the man repents he is absolved before God, before the
   sentence of the church, upon his contrition and dereliction only; and
   if he were not the church could not absolve him. The consequent of
   which evident truth is this, that, whatsoever impositions the
   church-officers impose upon the criminal, they are to avoid scandal, to
   testify repentance and to exercise it, to instruct the people, to make
   them fear, to represent the act of God and the secret and the true
   state of the sinner: and although they are not essentially necessary to
   our pardon, yet they are become necessary when the church hath seized
   upon the sinner by public notice of the crime; necessary (I say) for
   the removing the scandal and giving testimony of our contrition, and
   for the receiving all that comfort which he needs and can derive from
   the promises of pardon as they are published by him that is commanded
   to preach them to all them that repent. And therefore, although it
   cannot be necessary as to the obtaining pardon that the priest should
   in private absolve a sick man from his private sins, and there is no
   loosing where there was no precedent binding, and he that was only
   bound before God, can before him only be loosed - yet as to confess
   sins to any Christian in private may have many good ends, and to
   confess them to a clergyman may have many more, so to hear God's
   sentence at the mouth of the minister, pardon pronounced by God's
   ambassador, is of huge comfort to them that cannot otherwise be
   comforted, and whose infirmity needs it; and therefore it were very fit
   it were not neglected in the days of our fear and danger, of our
   infirmities and sorrow.

   5. The execution of this ministry being an act of prudence and charity,
   and therefore relative to changing circumstances, it hath been, and in
   many cases may, and in some must, be rescinded and altered. The time of
   separation may be lengthened and shortened, the condition made lighter
   or heavier, and for the same offence the clergyman is deposed, but yet
   admitted to the communion for which one of the people who hath no
   office to lose is denied the benefit of communicating; and this
   sometimes when he might lawfully receive it: and a private man is
   separate when a multitude or a prince is not, cannot, ought not; and at
   last, when the case of sickness and danger of death did occur, they
   admitted all men that desired it; sometimes without scruple or
   difficulty, sometimes with some little restraint in great or insolent
   cases, (as in the case of apostasy, in which the council of Arles
   denied absolution unless they received and gave public satisfaction by
   acts of repentance; and some other councils denied at any time to do it
   to such persons,) according as seemed fitting to the present
   necessities of the church. All which particulars declare it to be no
   part of a divine commandment that any man should be denied to receive
   the communion if he desires it, and if he be in any probable capacity
   of receiving it.

   6. Since the separation was an act of liberty and a direct negative, it
   follows that the restitution was a mere doing that which they refused
   formerly, and to give the holy communion was the formality of
   absolution, and all the instrument and the whole matter of
   reconcilement; the taking off the punishment is the pardoning of the
   sin; for this without the other is but a word; and if this be done, I
   care not whether any thing is said or no Vinum Dominicum ministratoris
   gratia est is also true in this sense; to give the chalice and cup is
   the grace and indulgence of the minister; and when that is done, the
   man hath obtained the peace of the church; and to do that is all the
   absolution the church can give. And they were vain disputes which were
   commenced some few ages since, concerning the forms of absolution,
   whether they were indicative or optative, by way of declaration or by
   way of sentence, for at first they had no forms at all, but they said a
   prayer, and, after the manner of the Jews, laid hands upon the penitent
   when they prayed over him, and so admitted him to the holy communion;
   for since the church had no power over her children but of
   excommunicating and denying them to attend upon holy offices and
   ministries respectively, neither could they have any absolution but to
   admit them thither from whence formerly they were forbidden; whatsoever
   ceremony or forms did signify, this was superinduced and arbitrary,
   alterable and accidental; it had variety but no necessity.

   7. The practice consequent to this is, that if the penitent be bound by
   the positive censures of the church, he is to be reconciled upon those
   conditions which the laws of the church tie him to in case he can
   perform them: if he cannot, he can no longer be prejudiced by the
   censure of the church, [167] which had no relation but the people, with
   whom the dying man is no longer to converse: for whatsoever relates to
   God is to be transacted in spiritual ways by contrition and internal
   graces; and the mercy of the church is such as to give him her peace
   and her blessing upon his undertaking to obey her injunctions, if he
   shall be able: which injunctions, if they be declared by public
   sentence, the minister hath nothing to do in the affairs but to remind
   him of his obligation and reconcile him, that is, give him the holy
   sacrament.

   8. If the penitent be not bound by public sentence, the minister is to
   make his repentance as great, and his heart as contrite, as he can; to
   dispose him by the repetition of acts of grace in the way of prayer,
   and in real and exterior instances where he can; and then to give him
   the holy communion in all the same cases in which he ought not to have
   denied it to him in his health; that is, even in the beginnings of such
   a repentance which by human signs he believes to be real and holy; and
   after this the event must be left to God. The reason of the rule
   depends upon this, because there is no divine commandment directly
   forbidding the rulers of the church to give the communion to any
   Christian that desires it and professes repentance of his sins. And all
   church-discipline in every instance, and to every single person, was
   imposed upon him by men who did it according to the necessities of this
   state and constitution of our affairs below: but we, who are but
   ministers and delegates of pardon and condemnation, must resign and
   give up our judgment when the man is no more to be judged by the
   sentences of man, and by the proportions of this world, but of the
   other: to which, if our reconciliation does advantage, we ought in
   charity to send him forth with all the advantages he can receive; for
   he will need them all. And therefore the Niceen council commands [168]
   that no man be deprived of this necessary passport in the article of
   his death, and calls this the ancient and canonical law of the church;
   and to minister it only supposes the man in the communion of the
   church, not always in the state, but ever in the possibilities, of
   sanctification. They who in the article and danger of death were
   admitted to the communion, and tied to penance if they recovered,
   (which was ever the custom of the ancient church, unless in very few
   cases,) were but in the threshold of repentance in the commencement and
   first introductions to a devout life; and, indeed, then it is a fit
   ministry that it be given in all the periods of time in which the
   pardons of sins is working, since it is the sacrament of that great
   mystery, and the exhibition of that blood which is shed for the
   remission of sins.

   9. The minister of religion ought not to give the communion to a sick
   person if he retains the affection to any sin, and refuses to disavow
   it, or profess repentance of all sins whatsoever, if he be required to
   do it. The reason is, because it is a certain death to him, and an
   increase of his misery, if he shall so profane the body and blood of
   Christ as to take it into so unholy a breast, where Satan reigns, and
   sin is principal, and the Spirit is extinguished, and Christ loves not
   to enter, because he is not suffered to inhabit. But when he professes
   repentance, [169] and does such acts of it as his present condition
   permits, he is to be presumed to intend heartily what he professes
   solemnly; and the minister is only the judge of outward act, and by
   that only he is to take information concerning the inward. But whether
   he be so or no, or if he be, whether that be timely, and effectual, and
   sufficient toward the pardon of sins before God, is another
   consideration of which we may conjecture here, but we shall know it at
   dooms-day. The spiritual man is to do his ministry by the rules of
   Christ, and as the customs of the church appoint him, and after the
   manner of men: the event is in the hands of God, and is to be expected,
   not directly and wholly according to his ministry, but to the former
   life, or the timely internal repentance and amendment, of which I have
   already given accounts. These ministries are acts of order and great
   assistances, but the sum of affairs does not rely upon them. And if any
   man puts his whole repentance upon this time, or all his hopes upon
   these ministries, he will find them and himself to fail.

   10. It is the minister's office to invite sick and dying persons to the
   holy sacrament; such whose lives were fair and laudable, and yet their
   sickness sad and violent, making them listless and of slow desires, and
   slower apprehensions; that such persons who are in the state of grace
   may lose no accidental advantages of spiritual improvement, but may
   receive into their dying bodies the symbols and great consignations of
   the resurrection, and into their souls the pledges of immortality, and
   may appear before God their father in the union and with the impresses
   and likeness of their elder brother. But if the persons be of ill
   report, and have lived wickedly, they are not to be invited; because
   their case is hugely suspicious, though they then repent and call for
   mercy: but if they demand it, they are not to be denied; only let the
   minister in general represent the evil consequence of an unworthy
   participation; and if the penitent will judge himself unworthy, let him
   stand candidate for pardon at the hands of God, and stand or fall by
   that unerring and merciful sentence, to which his severity of
   condemning himself before men will make the easier and more hopeful
   address. And the strictest among the Christians who denied to reconcile
   lapsed persons after baptism, yet acknowledged that there were hopes
   reserved in the court of heaven for them, though not here; since we,
   who are easily deceived by the pretenses of a real return, are tied to
   dispense God's graces, as he hath given us commission, with fear and
   trembling, and without too forward confidences; and God hath mercies
   which we know not of; and therefore, because we know them not, such
   persons were referred to God's tribunal, where he would find them if
   they were to be had at all.

   11. When the holy sacrament is to be administered, let the exhortation
   be made proper to the mystery, but fitted to the man; that is, that it
   be used for the advantages of faith, or love, or contrition: let all
   the circumstances and parts of the divine love be represented, all the
   mysterious advantages of the blessed sacrament be declared, that it is
   the bread which came from heaven; that it is the representation of
   Christ's death to all the purposes and capacities of faith, and the
   real exhibition of Christ's body and blood to all the purposes of the
   Spirit; that it is the earnest of the resurrection, and the seed of a
   glorious immortality; that as by our cognation to the body of the first
   Adam we took in death, so, by our union with the body of the second
   Adam, we shall have the inheritance of life; (for as by Adam came
   death, so by Christ cometh the resurrection of the dead; [170] ) that
   if we, being worthy communicants of these sacred pledges, being
   presented to God with Christ within us, our being accepted of God is
   certain, even for the sake of his well-beloved that dwells within us;
   that this is the sacrament of that body which was broken for our sins,
   of that blood which purifies our souls, by which we are presented to
   God pure and holy in the beloved; that now we may ascertain our hopes
   and make our faith confident; for he that hath given us his Son, how
   should not he with him give us all things else?' [171] Upon these or
   the like considerations the sick man may be assisted in his address,
   and his faith strengthened, and his hope confirmed, and his charity be
   enlarged.

   12. The manner of the sick man's reception of the holy sacrament hath
   in it nothing differing from the ordinary solemnities of the sacrament,
   [172] save only that abatement is to be made of such accidental
   circumstances as by the laws and customs of the church healthful
   persons are obliged to, such as fasting, kneeling, etc. Though I
   remember that it was noted for great devotion in the legate that died
   at Trent, that he caused himself to be sustained upon his knees when he
   received the viaticum, or the holy sacrament, before, his death; and it
   was greater in Huniades that he caused himself to be carried to the
   church, that there he might receive his Lord in his Lord's house; and
   it was recorded for honour, that William, the pious archbishop of
   Bourges, a small time before his last agony, sprang out of his bed at
   the presence of the holy sacrament, and, upon his knees and his face,
   recommended his soul to his Saviour. But in these things no man is to
   be prejudiced or censured.

   13. Let not the holy sacrament be administered to dying persons, when
   they have no use of reason to make that duty acceptable, and the
   mysteries effective to the purposes of the soul. For the sacraments and
   ceremonies of the gospel operate not without the concurrent actions and
   moral influences of the suscipient. To infuse the chalice into the cold
   lips of the clinic may disturb his agony, but cannot relieve the soul
   which only receives improvement by acts of grace and choice, to which
   the external rites are apt and appointed to minister in a capable
   person. All other persons, as fools, children, distracted persons,
   lethargical, apoplectical, or any ways senseless and incapable of human
   and reasonable acts, are to be assisted only by prayers; for they may
   prevail even for the absent, and for enemies, and for all those who
   join not in the office.

  SECTION V.

    Of Ministering to the Sick Person by the Spiritual Man, as he is the
    Physician of Souls.

   1. In all cases of receiving confessions of sick men, and the assisting
   to the advancement of repentance, the minister is to apportion to every
   kind of sin such spiritual remedies which are apt to mortify and cure
   the sin; such as abstinence from their occasions and opportunities, to
   avoid temptations, to resist their beginnings, to punish the crime by
   acts of indignation against the person, fastings and prayer, alms and
   all the instances of charity, asking forgiveness, restitution of
   wrongs, satisfaction of injuries, acts of virtue contrary to the
   crimes. And although, in great and dangerous sicknesses, they are not
   directly to be imposed unless they are not directly to be imposed
   unless they are direct matters of duty; yet, where they are medicinal,
   they are to be insinuated, and in general signification remarked to
   him, and undertaken accordingly; concerning which, when he returns to
   health, he is to receive particular advices. And this advice was
   inserted into the penitential of England, in the time of Theodore,
   archbishop of Canterbury, and afterwards adopted into the canon of the
   western churches. [173]

   2. The proper temptations of sick men, for which a remedy is not yet
   provided, are unreasonable fears and unreasonable confidences, which
   the minister is to cure by the following considerations:

   Considerations against Unreasonable Fears of not having our Sins
   pardoned.

   Many good men, especially such who have tender consciences, impatient
   of the least sin, to which they are arrived by a long grace, and a
   continual observation of their actions, and the parts of a lasting
   repentance, many times overact their tenderness, and turn their caution
   into scruple, and care of their duty into inquiries after the event,
   and askings after the counsels of God and the sentences of doomsday.

   He that asks of the standers-by, or of the minister, whether they think
   he shall be saved or damned, is to be answered with the words of pity
   and reproof. Seek not after new light for the searching into the
   private records of God: look as much as you list into the pages of
   revelation, for they concern your duty; but the event is registered in
   heaven, and we can expect no other certain notices of it, but that it
   shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by the Father of
   mercies. We have light enough to tell our duty; and if we do that, we
   need not fear what the issue will be; and if we do not, let us never
   look for more light, or inquire after God's pleasure concerning our
   souls, since we so little serve his ends in those things where he hath
   given us light. But yet this I add, that as pardon of sins in the Old
   Testament [174] was nothing but removing the punishment, which then was
   temporal, and therefore many times they could tell if their sins were
   pardoned; and concerning pardon of sins, they then had no fears of
   conscience but while the punishment was on them, for so long indeed it
   was unpardoned, and how long it would so remain it was matter of fear
   and of present sorrow; besides this, in the Gospel pardon of sins is
   another thing; pardon for sins is a sanctification; Christ came to take
   away our sins, by turning every one of us from our iniquities; [175]
   and there is not in the nature of the thing any expectation of pardon,
   or sign or signification of it, but so far as the thing itself
   discovers itself. As we hate sin, and grow in grace, and arrive at the
   state of holiness, which is also a state of repentance and
   imperfection, but yet of sincerity of heart and diligent endeavour; in
   the same degree we are to judge concerning the forgiveness of sins: for
   indeed that is the evangelical forgiveness, and it signifies our
   pardon, because it effects it, or rather it is in the nature of the
   thing; so that we are to inquire into no hidden records: forgiveness of
   sins is not a secret sentence, a word, or a record; but it is a state
   of change, and effected upon us; and upon ourselves we look for it, to
   read it, and understand it. We are only to be curious of our duty, and
   confident of the article of the remission of sins; [176] and the
   conclusion of these premises will be, that we shall be full of hopes of
   a prosperous resurrection; and our fear and trembling are no instances
   of our calamity, but parts of duty; we shall sure enough be wafted to
   the shore, although we be tossed with the winds of our sighs, and the
   unevenness of our fears, and the ebbings and flowings of our passions,
   if we sail in a right channel, and steer by a perfect compass, and look
   up to God, and call for his help, and do our own endeavour. There are
   very many reasons why men ought not to despair; and there are not very
   many men that ever go beyond a hope till they pass into possession. If
   our fears have any mixture of hope, that is enough to enable and to
   excite our duty; and if we have a strong hope, when we cast about we
   shall find reason enough to have many fears. Let not this fear weaken
   our hands; and if it allay our gaieties and our confidences, it is no
   harm. In this uncertainty we must abide if we have committed sins after
   baptism; and those confidences which some men glory in are not real
   supports or good foundations. The fearing man is the safest; and if he
   fears on his death-bed, it is but what happens to most considering men,
   and what was to be looked for all his life time: he talked of the
   terrors of death, and death is the king of terrors; and therefore it is
   no strange thing if then he be hugely afraid; if he be not, it is
   either a great felicity or a great presumption. But if he want some
   degree of comfort, or a greater degree of hope, let him be refreshed by
   considering,

   1. That Christ came into the world to save sinners. [177] 2. That God
   delights not in the confusion and death of sinners. 3. That in heaven
   there is great joy at the conversion of a sinner. 4. That Christ is a
   perpetual advocate, daily interceding with his Father for our pardon.
   5. That God uses infinite arts, instruments, and devices, to reconcile
   us to himself. 6. That he prays us to be in charity with him, and to be
   forgiven. 7. That he sends angels to keep us from violence and evil
   company, from temptations and surprises, and his Holy Spirit to guide
   us in holy ways, and his servants to warn us and remind us perpetually:
   and therefore since certainly he is so desirous of save us, as appears
   by his word, by his oaths, by his very nature, and his daily artifices
   of mercy, it is not likely that he will condemn us without great
   provocations of his majesty, and perserverance in them. 8. That the
   covenant of the Gospel is a covenant of grace and of repentance, and
   being established with so many great solemnities and miracles from
   heaven, must signify a huge favour and a mighty change of things; and
   therefore that repentance, which is the great condition of it is a
   grace that does not expire in little accents and minutes, but hath a
   great latitude of signification, and large extension of parts, under
   the protection of all which persons are safe even when they fear
   exceedingly. 9. That there are great degrees and differences of glory
   in heaven; and therefore, if we estimate our piety by proportions to
   the more eminent persons and devouter people, we are not to conclude we
   shall not enter into the same state of glory, but that we shall not go
   into the same degree. 10. That although forgiveness of sins is
   consigned to us in baptism, and that this baptism is but once, and
   cannot be repeated; yet forgiveness of sins is the grace of the Gospel,
   which is perpetually remanent upon us, and secured unto us so long as
   we have not renounced our baptism: for then we enter into the condition
   of repentance; and repentance is not an indivisible grace, or a thing
   performed at once, but it is working all our lives: and therefore so is
   our pardon, which ebbs and flows according as we discompose or renew
   the decency of our baptismal promises; and therefore it ought to be
   certain that no man despair of pardon but he that hath voluntarily
   renounced his baptism, or willingly estranged himself from that
   covenant. He that sticks to it, and still professes the religion, and
   approves the faith, and endeavours to obey and to do his duty, this man
   hath all the veracity of God to assure him and give him confidence that
   he is not in an impossible state of salvation unless God cuts him off
   before he can work, or that he begins to work when he can no longer
   choose. 11. And then let him consider, the more he fears the more he
   hates his sin that is the cause of it, and the less he can be tempted
   to it, and the more desirous he is of heaven; and therefore such fears
   are good instruments of grace, and good signs of a future pardon. 12.
   That God in the old law although he made a covenant of perfect
   obedience and did not promise pardon at all after great sins, yet he
   did give pardon, and declared it so to them for their own and for our
   sakes too. So he did to David, to Manasses, to the whole nation of the
   Israelites, ten times in the wilderness, even after their apostacies
   and idolatries. And in the prophets the mercies of God and his
   remissions of sins were largely preached, though in the law God put on
   the robes of an angry judge and a severe lord. But therefore in the
   Gospel, where he hath established the whole sum of affairs upon faith
   and repentance, if God should not pardon great sinners that repent
   after baptism with a free dispensation, the Gospel were far harder than
   the intolerable covenant of the law. 13. That if a proselyte went into
   the Jewish communion, and were circumcised and baptized, he entered
   into all the hopes of good things which God had promised or would give
   to his people; and yet that was but the covenant of works. If, then,
   the Gentile proselytes, by their circumcision and legal baptism, were
   admitted to a state of pardon, to last so long as they were in the
   covenant, even after their admission, for sins committed against
   Moses's law, which they then undertook to observe exactly; in the
   Gospel, which is the covenant of faith, it must needs be certain that
   there is a greater grace given, and an easier condition entered into,
   than was that of the Jewish law; and that is nothing else but that
   abatement is made for our infirmities, and our single evils, and our
   timely-repented and forsaken habits of sin, and our violent passions,
   when they are contested withal, and fought with, and under discipline,
   and in the beginnings and progresses of mortification. 14. That God
   hath erected in his church a whole order of men, the main part and
   dignity of whose work it is to remit and retain sins by a perpetual and
   daily ministry; and this they do, not only in baptism, but in all their
   offices to be administered afterwards, in the holy sacrament of the
   eucharist, which exhibits the symbols of that blood which was shed for
   pardon of our sins, and therefore, by its continued mystery and
   repetition declares that all that while we are within the ordinary
   powers and usual dispensations of pardon, even so long as we are in any
   probable dispositions to receive that holy sacrament. And the same
   effect is also signified and exhibited in the whole power of the keys,
   which, if it extends to private sins, sins done in secret, it is
   certain it does also to public. But this is a greater testimony of the
   certainty of the remissibility of our greatest sins; for public sins,
   as they always have a sting and a superadded formality of scandal and
   ill example, so they are most commonly the greatest; such as murder,
   sacrilege, and others of unconcealed nature, and unprivate action; and
   if God, for these worst of evils, hath appointed an office of ease and
   pardon, which is and may daily be administered, that will be an uneasy
   pusillanimity and fond suspicion of God's goodness to fear that our
   repentance shall be rejected, even although we have committed the
   greatest or the most of evils. 15. And it was concerning baptized
   Christians that St. John said, If any man sin, we have an advocate with
   the Father, and he is the propitiation for our sins;' and concerning
   lapsed Christians St. Paul gave instruction, that if any man be
   overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a man in the
   spirit of meekness; considering lest ye also be tempted.' The
   Corinthian Christian committed incest, and was pardoned; and Simon
   Magus after he was baptized, offered to commit his own sin of simony,
   and yet St. Peter bid him pray for pardon; and St. James tells, that if
   the sick man sends for the elders of the church, and they pray over
   him, and he confess his sins, they shall be forgiven him.' 16. That
   only one sin is declared to be irremissible, the sin against the Holy
   Ghost, the sin unto death,' as St. John calls it, for which we are not
   bound to pray - for all others we are; and certain it is no man commits
   a sin against the Holy Ghost, if he be afraid he hath, and desires that
   he had not; for such penitential passions are against the definition of
   that sin. 17. That all the sermons in the Scripture written to
   Christians and disciples of Jesus, exhorting men to repentance, to be
   afflicted, to mourn and to weep, to confession of sins, are sure
   testimonies of God's purpose and desire to forgive us, even when we
   fall after baptism; and if our fall after baptism were irrecoverable,
   than all preaching were in vain, and our faith were also vain, and we
   could not with comfort rehearse the creed, in which, as soon as ever we
   profess Jesus to have died for our sins, we also are condemned by our
   own conscience of a sin that shall not be forgiven; and then all
   exhortations and comforts and fasts and disciplines were useless and
   too late, if they were not given us before we can understand them; for,
   most commonly, as soon as we can, we enter into the regions of sin, for
   we commit evil actions before we understand, and together with our
   understanding they begin to be imputed. 18. That if it could be
   otherwise, infants were very ill provided for in the church who were
   baptized, when they have no stain upon their brows but the misery they
   contracted from Adam; and they are left to be angels for ever after,
   and live innocently in the midst of their ignorances and weaknesses and
   temptations and the heat and follies of youth, or else to perish in an
   eternal ruin. We cannot think of speak good things of God if we
   entertain such evil suspicions of the mercies of the Father of our Lord
   Jesus. 19. That the long-sufferance and patience of God is indeed
   wonderful; but therefore it leaves us in certainties of pardon, so long
   as there is the possibility to return, if we reduce the power to act.
   20. That God calls upon us to forgive our brother seventy times seven
   times, and yet all that is but like the forgiving a hundred pence for
   his sake who forgives us ten thousand talents; for so the Lord
   professed that he had done to him that was his servant and his
   domestic. 21. That if we can forgive a hundred thousand times, it is
   certain God will do so to us, our blessed Lord having commanded us to
   pray for pardon as we pardon our offending and penitent brother. 22.
   That even in the case of very great sins, and great judgments inflicted
   upon the sinners, wise and good men and presidents of religion have
   declared their sense to be, that God spent all his anger, and made it
   expire in that temporal misery; and so it was supposed to have been
   done in the case of Ananias: but that the hopes of any penitent man may
   not rely upon any uncertainty, we find in holy Scripture that those
   Christians who had for their scandalous crimes deserved to be given
   over to Satan to be buffeted, yet had hopes to be saved in the day of
   the Lord. 23. That God glories in the titles of mercy and forgiveness,
   and will not have his appellatives so finite and limited as to expire
   in one act, or in a seldom pardon. 24. That man's condition were
   desperate, and like that of the fallen angels, equally desperate, but
   unequally oppressed, considering our infinite weaknesses and
   ignorances, (in respect of their excellent understanding and perfect
   choice,) if he could be admitted to no repentance after his infant
   baptism; and if he may be admitted to one, there is nothing in the
   covenant of the Gospel but he may also to a second, and so for ever, as
   long as he can repent and return and live to God in a timely religion.
   25. That every man is a sinner - in many things we offend all;' [178]
   and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves;' [179] and
   therefore either all must perish, or else there is mercy for all; and
   so there is, upon this very stock, because Christ died for sinners,'
   [180] and God hath comprehended all under sin, that he might have mercy
   upon all.' [181] 26. That if ever God sends temporal punishments into
   the world with purposes of amendment, and if they be not all of them
   certain consignations to hell, and unless every man that breaks his
   leg, or in punishment loses a child or wife, be certainly damned, it is
   certain that God in these cases is angry and loving, chastises the sin
   to amend the person, and smites that he may cure, and judge that he may
   absolve. 27. That he that will not quench the smoking flax, nor break
   the bruised reed - will not tie us to perfection and the laws and
   measures of heaven upon earth; and if, in every period of our
   repentance, he is pleased with our duty, and the voice of our heart,
   and the hand of our desires, he hath told us plainly that he will not
   only pardon all the sins of the days of our folly, but the returns and
   surprises of sins in the days of repentance, if we give no way, and
   allow no affection, and give no place to anything that is God's enemy;
   all the past sins, and all the seldom-returning and ever-repented evils
   put upon the accounts of the cross.

   An Exercise against Despair in the Day of our Death.

   To which may be added this short exercise, to be used for the curing
   the temptation to direct despair, in case that the hope and faith of
   good men be assaulted in the day of their calamity.

   I consider that the ground of my trouble is my sin; and if it were not
   for that, I should not need to be troubled; but the help that all the
   world looks for is such as supposes a man to be a sinner. Indeed, if
   from myself I were to derive my title to heaven, then my sins were a
   just argument of despair; but now that they bring me to Christ, that
   they drive me to an appeal to God's mercies, and to take sanctuary in
   the cross, they ought not, they cannot, infer a just cause of despair.
   I am sure it is a stranger thing that God should take upon him hands
   and feet, and those hands and feet should be nailed upon a cross, than
   that a man should be partaker of the felicities of pardon and life
   eternal; and it were stranger yet that God should do so much for man,
   and that a man that desires it, that labours for it, that is in life
   and possibilities of working his salvation, should inevitably miss that
   end for which that God suffered so much. For what is the meaning, and
   what is the extent, and what are the significations, of the divine
   mercy in pardoning sinners? If it be thought a great matter that I am
   charged with original sin, I confess I feel the weight of it in loads
   of temporal infelicities and proclivities to sin; but I fear not the
   guilt of it, since I am baptized, and it cannot do honour to the
   reputation of God's mercy that it should be all spent in remissions of
   what I never chose, never acted, never knew of, could not help,
   concerning which I received no commandment, no prohibition. But,
   blessed be God, it is ordered in just measures that that original evil
   which I contracted without my knowledge; and what I suffered before I
   had a being was cleansed before I had an useful understanding. But I am
   taught to believe God's mercies to be infinite, not only in himself but
   to us; for mercy is a relative term, and we are its correspondent: of
   all the creatures which God made, we only, in a proper sense, are the
   subjects of mercy and remission. Angels have more of God's bounty than
   we have, but not so much of his mercy; and beasts have little rays of
   his kindness, and effects of his wisdom and graciousness in petty
   donatives, but nothing of mercy; for they have no laws, and therefore
   no sins, and need no mercy, nor are capable of any. Since, therefore,
   man alone is the correlative, or proper object and vessel of reception
   of an infinite mercy, and that mercy is in giving and forgiving, I have
   reason to hope that he will so forgive me that my sins shall not hinder
   me of heaven; or because it is a gift, I may also, upon the stock of
   the same infinite mercy, hope he will give heaven to me; and if I have
   it either upon the title of giving or forgiving, it is alike to me, and
   will alike magnify the glories of the divine mercy. And because eternal
   life is the gift of God, [182] I have less reason to despair; for if my
   sins were fewer, and my disproportions towards such a glory were less,
   and my evenness more, yet it is still a gift, and I could not receive
   it but as a free and a gracious donative, and so I may still: God can
   still give it me; and it is not an impossible expectation to wait and
   look for such a gift at the hands of the God of mercy; the best men
   deserve it not, and I, who am the worst, may have it given me. And I
   consider that God hath set no measures of his mercy, but that we be
   within the covenant, that is, repenting persons, endeavouring to serve
   him with an honest, single heart; and that within this covenant there
   is a very great latitude and variety of persons and degrees and
   capacities; and therefore that it cannot stand with the proportions of
   so infinite a mercy that obedience be exacted to such a point, which he
   never expressed, unless it should be the least, and that to which all
   capacities, though otherwise unequal, are fitted and sufficiently
   enabled. But, however, I find that the Spirit of God taught the writers
   of the New Testament to apply to us all in general, and to every single
   person in particular, some gracious words which God in the Old
   Testament spake to one man upon a special occasion in a single and
   temporal instance. Such are the words which God spake to Joshua; I will
   never fail thee, nor forsake thee:' and upon the stock of that promise
   St. Paul forbids covetousness and persuades contentedness, [183]
   because those words were spoken by God to Joshua in another case. If
   the gracious words of God have so great an extension of parts, and
   intention of kind purposes, then how many comforts have we upon the
   stock of all the excellent words which are spoken in the prophets and
   in the Psalms? and I will never more question whether they be spoken
   concerning me, having such an authentic precedent so to expound the
   excellent words of God; all the treasures of God which are in the
   Psalms are my own riches, and the wealth of my hope; there will I look,
   and whatsoever I can need, that I will depend upon. For certainly, if
   we could understand it, that which is infinite (as God is) must needs
   be some such kind of thing: it must go whither it was never sent, and
   signify what was not first intended, and it must warm with its light,
   and shine with its heat, and refresh when it strikes, and heal when it
   wounds, and ascertain where it makes afraid, and intend all when it
   warns one, and mean a great deal in a small word. And as the sun,
   passing to its southern tropic, looks with an open eye upon his
   sun-burnt Ethiopians, but at the same time sends light from its
   posterns, and collateral influences from the back side of his beams,
   and sees the corners of the east when his face tends towards the west,
   because he is a round body of fire, and hath some little images and
   resemblances of the Infinite; so is God's mercy when it looked upon
   Moses: it relieved St. Paul, and it pardoned David, and gave hope to
   Manasses, and might have restored Judas if he would have had hope, and
   used himself accordingly. But as to my own case, I have sinned
   grievously and frequently; [184] but I have repented it; but I have
   begged pardon; I have confessed it and forsaken it. I cannot undo what
   was done, and I perish if God hath appointed no remedy, if there be no
   remission; but then my religion falls together with my hope, and God's
   word fails as well as I. But I believe the article of forgiveness of
   sins; and if there be any such thing I may do well, for I have and do
   and will do that which all good men call repentance, that is, I will be
   humbled before God, and mourn for my sin, and for ever ask forgiveness,
   and judge myself, and leave it with haste, and mortify it with
   diligence, and watch against it carefully. And this I can do but in the
   manner of man; I can but mourn for my sins, as I apprehend grief in
   other instances, but I will rather choose to suffer all evils than to
   do one deliberate act of sin. I know my sins are greater than my
   sorrow, and too many for my memory, and too insinuating to be prevented
   by all my are; but I know also that God knows and pities my
   infirmities, and how far that will extend I know not, but that it will
   reach so far as to satisfy my needs is the matter of my hope. But this
   I am sure of, that I have in my great necessity prayed humbly and with
   great desire, and sometimes I have been heard in kind, and sometimes
   have had a bigger mercy instead of it; and I have the hope of prayers,
   and the hope of my confession, and the hope of my endeavour, and the
   hope of many promises, and of God's essential goodness; and I am sure
   that God hath heard my prayers, and verified his promises in temporal
   instances, for he ever gave me sufficient for my life; and although he
   promised such supplies, and grounded the confidences of them upon our
   last seeking the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, yet he hath
   verified it to me who have not sought it as I ought; but therefore I
   hope he accepted my endeavour, or will give his great gifts and our
   great expectation even to the weakest endeavour, to the least, so it be
   a hearty piety. And sometimes I have had some cheerful visitations of
   God's Spirit, and my cup hath been crowned with comfort, and the wine
   that made my heart glad danced in the chalice, and I was glad that God
   would have me so; and therefore I hope this cloud may pass; for that
   which was then a real cause of comfort is so still if I could discern
   it, and I shall discern it when the veil is taken from mine eyes. And,
   blessed be God, I can still remember that there are temptations to
   despair; and they could not be temptations if they were not apt to
   persuade, and had seeming probability on their side; and they that
   despair think they do it with the greatest reason; for if they were not
   confident of the reason, but that it were such an argument as might be
   opposed or suspected, then they could not despair. Despair assents as
   firmly and strongly as faith itself; but because it is a temptation,
   and despair is a horrid sin, there it is certain those persons are
   unreasonably abused, and they have no reason to despair, for all their
   confidence; and, therefore, although I have strong reasons to condemn
   my despair, which therefore is unreasonable, because it is a sin, and a
   dishonour to God, and a ruin to my condition, and verifies itself if I
   do not look to it. For as the hypochondriac person that thought himself
   dead made his dream true when he starved himself because dead people
   eat not; so do despairing sinners lose God's mercies by refusing to use
   and to believe them. And I hope it is a disease of judgment, not an
   intolerable condition, that I am falling into; because I have been
   afflicted, because they see not their pardon sealed after the manner of
   this world; and the affairs of the Spirit are transacted by immaterial
   notices, by propositions and spiritual discourses, by promises which
   are to be verified hereafter: and here we must live in a cloud, in
   darkness under a veil, in fear and uncertainties; and our very living
   by faith and hope is a life of mystery and secrecy, the only part of
   the manner of that life in which we shall live in the state of
   separation. And when a distemper of body or an infirmity of mind
   happens in the instances of such secret and reserved affairs, we may
   easily mistake the manner of our notices for the uncertainty of the
   thing; and therefore it is but reason I should stay till the state and
   manner of my abode be changed before I despair: there it can be no sin
   nor error, here it may be both; and if it be that, it is also this, and
   then a man may perish for being miserable, and be undone for being a
   fool. In conclusion, my hope is in God, and I will trust him with the
   event, which I am sure will be just, and I hope full of mercy. However
   now I will use all the spiritual arts of reason and religion to make me
   more and more to love God, that if I miscarry, charity also shall fail,
   and something that loves God shall perish and be damned, which if it be
   possible than I may do well.

   These considerations may be useful to men of little hearts and of great
   piety; or if they be persons who have lived without infamy, or begun
   their repentance so late that it is very imperfect, and yet so early
   that it was before the arrest of death. But if the man be a vicious
   person, and hath persevered in a vicious life till his death-bed, these
   considerations are not proper. Let him inquire, in the words of the
   first disciples after Pentecost, Men and brethren, what shall we do to
   be saved?' and if they can but entertain so much hope as to enable them
   to do so much of their duty as they can for the present, it is all that
   can be provided for them: an inquiry, in their case, can have no other
   purposes of religion or prudence. And the minister must be infinitely
   careful that he do not go about to comfort vicious persons with the
   comforts belonging to God's elect, lest he prostitute holy things, and
   make them common, and his sermons deceitful, and vices be encouraged in
   others, and the man himself find that he was deceived, when he descends
   into his house of sorrow.

   But because very few men are tempted with too great fears of failing,
   but very many are tempted by confidence and presumption, the ministers
   of religion had need be instructed with spiritual armour to resist this
   firey dart of the devil, when it operates to evil purposes.

  SECTION VI.

    Considerations against Presumption.

   I have already enumerated many particulars to provoke drowsy conscience
   to a scrutiny and to a suspection of himself, that by seeing cause to
   suspect his condition he might more freely accuse himself, and attend
   to the necessities and duties of repentance; but if either before or in
   his repentance he grow too big in his spirit, so as either he does some
   little violences to the modesties of humility, or abates his care and
   zeal to his repentance, the spiritual man must allay his forwardness by
   representing to him, 1. That the growths in grace are long, difficult,
   uncertain, hindered, of many parts and great variety. 2. That an infant
   grace is soon dashed and discountenanced, often running into an
   inconvenience and the evils of an imprudent conduct, being zealous and
   forward, and therefore confident, but always with the least reason and
   the greatest danger; like children and young fellows, whose confidence
   hath no other reason but that they understand not their danger and
   their follies. 3. That he that puts on his armour ought not to boast as
   he that puts it off; and the apostle chides the Galatians for ending in
   the flesh after they had begun in the spirit. 4. That a man cannot
   think too meanly of himself, but very easily he may thing too high. 5.
   That a wise man will always, in a matter of great concernment, think
   the worst, and a good man will condemn himself with hearty sentence. 6.
   That humility and modesty of judgment and of hope are very good
   instruments to procure a mercy and a fair reception at the day of our
   death; but presumption or bold opinions serve no end of God or man, and
   is always imprudent, ever fatal, and of all things in the world is its
   own greatest enemy; for the more any man presumes, the greater reason
   he hath to fear. 7. That a man's heart is infinitely deceitful, unknown
   to itself, not certain in his own acts, praying one way and desiring
   another, wandering and imperfect loose and various, worshipping God and
   entertaining sin, following what it hates, and running from what it
   flatters, loving to be tempted and betrayed; petulant, like a wanton
   girl running from, that it might invite the fondness and enrage the
   appetite of the foolish young man, or the evil temptation that follows
   it; cold and indifferent one while, and presently zealous and
   passionate, furious and indiscreet; not understood of itself, or any
   one else, and deceitful beyond all the arts and numbers of observation.
   8. That it is certain we have highly sinned against God, but we are not
   so certain that our repentance is real and effective, integral and
   sufficient. 9. That it is not revealed to us whether or no the time of
   our repentance be not past; or, if it be not, yet how far God will give
   us pardon, and upon what condition, or after what sufferings or duties,
   is still under a cloud. 10. That virtue and vice are oftentimes so near
   neighbours that we pass into each other's borders without observation,
   and think we do justice when we are cruel; or call ourselves liberal
   when we are loose and foolish in expenses; and are amorous when we
   commend our own civilities and good nature. 11. That we allow to
   ourselves so many little irregularities, that insensibly they swell to
   so great a heap that from thence we have reason to fear an evil; for an
   army of frogs and flies may destroy all the hopes of our harvest. 12.
   That when we do that which is lawful, and do all that we can in those
   bounds, we commonly and easily run out of our proportions. 13. That it
   is not easy to distinguish the virtues of our nature from the virtues
   of our choice: and we may expect the reward of temperance, when it is
   against our nature to be drunk; or we hope to have the coronet of
   virgins for our morose disposition, or our abstinence from marriage
   upon secular ends. 14. That it may be we call every little sigh or the
   keeping a first-day the duty of repentance, or have entertained false
   principles in the estimate and measures of virtues; and, contrary to
   the steward in that gospel, we write down fourscore when we should be
   set down but fifty. 15. That it is better to trust the goodness and
   justice of God with our accounts than to offer him large bills. 16.
   That we are commanded by Christ to sit down bids us sit up higher. 17.
   That when we have done all that we can, we are unprofitable servants;'
   and yet no man does all that he can do, and therefore is more to be
   despised and undervalued. 18. That the self-accusing publican was
   justified rather than the thanksgiving and confident Pharisee. 19. That
   if Adam in paradise, and David in his house, and Solomon in the temple,
   and Peter in Christ's family, and Judas in the college of apostles, and
   Nicholas among the deacons, and the angels in heaven itself, did fall
   so foully and dishonestly, then it is prudent advice that we be not
   high-minded, but fear; and when we stand most confidently take heed
   lest we fall: and yet there is nothing so likely to make us fall as
   pride and great opinions, which ruined the angels, which God resists,
   which all men despise, and which betrays us into artlessness, and a
   reckless, undiscerning and an unwary spirit.

   4. Now the main parts of the ecclesiastical ministry are done; and that
   which remains is, that the minister pray over him and remind him to do
   good actions as he is capable; to call upon God for pardon; to put his
   whole trust in him; to resign himself to God's disposing; to be patient
   and even; to renounce every ill word or thought, or indecent action,
   which the violence of his sickness may cause in him; to beg of God to
   give him his Holy Spirit to guide him in his agony, and his holy angels
   to guard him in his passage.

   5. Whatsoever is besides this concerns the standers by; that they do
   all their ministers diligently and temperately; that they join with
   much charity and devotion in the prayer of the minister; that they make
   no outcries or exclamations in the departure of the soul; and that they
   make no judgment concerning the dying person, by his dying quietly or
   violently, with comfort or without, with great fears or a cheerful
   confidence, with sense or without, like a lamb or like a lion, with
   convulsions or semblances of great pain, or like an expiring and a
   spent candle; for these happen to all men without rule; without any
   known reason, but according as God pleases to dispense the grace or the
   punishment, for reasons only known to himself. Let us lay our hands
   upon our mouth, and adore the mysteries of the divine wisdom and
   providence, and pray to God to give the dying man rest and pardon, and
   to ourselves grace to live well, and the blessing of a holy and a happy
   death.

  SECTION VII.

    Offices to be said by the Minister in his Visitation of the Sick.

   In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. "Our
   Father, which art in heaven," etc.

   Let the Priest say this Prayer secretly

   O eternal Jesus, thou great lover of souls, who hast constituted a
   ministry in the church to glorify thy name, and to serve in the
   assistance of those that come to thee, prefessing thy discipline and
   service, give grace to me the unwrothiest of thy servants that I, in
   this my ministry, may purely and zealously intend thy glory, and
   effectually may minister comfort and advantages to this sick person;
   (whom God assoil from all his offences;) and grant that nothing of thy
   grace may perish to him by the unworthiness of the minister; but let
   thy Spirit speak to me, and give me prudence and charity, wisdom and
   diligence, good observation and apt discourses a certain judgment and
   merciful dispensation, that the soul of thy servant may pass from this
   state of imperfection to the perfections of the state of glory, through
   thy mercies, O eternal Jesus. Amen.

   The Psalm.

   Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice;
   let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. Psalm
   cxxx.

   If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who should stand.

   But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayst be feared.

   I wait for the Lord; my soul doth wait; and in his word do I hope.

   My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the
   morning.

   Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with
   him is plenteous redemption.

   And he shall redeem his servants from all their iniquities. Psalm cxxx.

   Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the wickedness of my
   heels shall compass me about? Psalm xlix. 5.

   No man can be any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom
   for him. Ver. 7.

   For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceasern for ever.
   Ver. 8.

   That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. Ver. 9.

   But wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and
   leave their wealth to others. Ver. 10.

   But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall
   receive me. Ver. 15.

   As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
   satisfied when I awake in thy likeness. Psalm xvii. 15.

   Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulness of
   joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. Psalm xvi. 11.

   Glory be to the Father, etc.

   As it was in the beginning, etc.

   Let us Pray.

   Almighty God, Father of mercies, the God of peace and comfort, of rest
   and pardon, we thy servants, though unworthy to pray for thee, yet, in
   duty to thee and charity to our brother, humbly beg mercy of thee for
   him, to descend upon his body and his soul; one sinner, O Lord, for
   another, the miserable for the afflicted, the poor for him that is in
   need; but thou givest thy graces and thy favours by the measures of thy
   own mercies, and in proportion to our necessities. We humbly come to
   thee in the name of Jesus, for the merit of our Saviour, and the
   mercies of our God, praying thee to pardon the sins of this thy
   servant, and to put them all upon the accounts of the cross, and to
   bury them in the grave of Jesus; that they may never rise up in
   judgment against thy servant, nor bring him to shame and confusion of
   face in the day of final inquiry and sentence. Amen.

    II.

   Give thy servant patience in his sorrows, comfort in this his sickness,
   and restore him to health, if it seems good to thee, in order to thy
   great ends and his greatest interest. And however thou shalt determine
   concerning him in this affair, yet make his repentance perfect, and his
   passage safe, and his faith strong, and his hope modest and confident;
   that when thou shalt call his soul from the prison of the body, it may
   enter into the securities and rest of the sons of God in the bosom of
   blessedness and the custodies of Jesus. Amen.

    III.

   Thou, O Lord, knowest all the necessities and all the infirmities of
   thy servant; fortify his spirit with spiritual joys and perfect
   resignation, and take from him all degrees of inordinate or insecure
   affections to this world, and enlarge his heart with desires of being
   with thee, and of freedom from sins, and fruition of God.

    IV.

   Lord, let not any pain or passion discompose the order and decency of
   his thoughts and duty; and lay no more upon thy servant than thou wilt
   make him able to bear; and together with the temptation do thou provide
   a way to escape, even by the mercies of a longer and a more holy life,
   or by the mercies of a blessed death; even as it pleaseth thee, O Lord,
   so let it be.

    V.

   Let the tenderness of his conscience and the Spirit of God call to mind
   his sins, that they may be confessed and repented of; because thou hast
   promised that if we confess our sins we shall have mercy. Let thy
   mighty grace draw out from his soul every root of bitterness, lest the
   remains of the old man be accursed with the reserves of thy wrath; but
   in the union of the holy Jesus, and in the charities of God and of the
   world, and the communion of all the saints, let this soul be presented
   to thee blameless and entirely pardoned, and thoroughly washed, through
   Jesus Christ our Lord.

   Here also may be inserted the Prayers set down after the holy Communion
   is administered.

   The prayer of St. Eustatius the Martyr, to be used by the sick of dying
   man, or by the priests or assistants in his behalf, which he said when
   he was going to martyrdom.

   I will praise thee, O Lord, that thou hast considered my low estate,
   and hast not shut me up in the hands of mine enemies, nor made my foes
   to rejoice over me; and now let thy right hand protect me, and let thy
   mercy come upon me; for my soul is in trouble and anguish because of
   its departure from the body. O let not the assemblies of its wicked and
   cruel enemies meet it in the passing forth, nor hinder me by reason of
   the sins of my past life. O Lord, be favourable unto me, that my soul
   may not behold the hellish countenance of the spirits of darkness, but
   let thy bright and joyful angels entertain it. Give glory to thy holy
   name and thou thy majesty; place me by thy merciful arm before thy seat
   of judgment, and let not the hand of the prince of this world snatch me
   from thy presence, or beat me into hell. Mercy, sweet Jesus. Amen.

   A prayer taken out of the Euchologion of the Greek church to be said
   by, or in behalf of, people in their danger, or at their death.

   beborboronenos taiz anartiaiz, etc.

    I.

   Bemired with sins and naked of good deeds, I that am the meat of worms
   cry vehemently in spirit; cast not me a wretch away from thy face;
   place me not on the left hand, who with thy hands didst fashion me; but
   give me rest unto my soul, for thy great mercy's sake, O Lord.

    II.

   Supplicate with tears unto Christ, who is to judge my poor soul, that
   he will deliver me from the fire that is unquenchable. I pray you all,
   my friends and acquaintance, make mention of my in your prayers, that
   in the day of judgment I may find mercy at that dreadful tribunal.

    III.

   Then may the Standers-by pray.

   When in unspeakable glory thou dost come dreadfully to judge the whole
   world, vouchsafe, O gracious Redeemer, that this thy faithful servant
   may in the clouds meet thee cheerfully. They who have been dead from
   the beginning, with terrible and fearful trembling stand at thy
   tribunal, waiting thy just sentence. O blessed Saviour Jesus! None
   shall there avoid thy formidable and most righteous judgment. All kings
   and princes with servants stand together, and hear the dreadful voice
   of the judge condemning the people which have sinned into hell; from
   which sad sentence, O Christ, deliver thy servant. Amen.

   Then let the sick man be called to rehearse the articles of his faith;
   or, if he be so weak he cannot, let him (if he have not before done it)
   be called to say Amen when they are recited, or to give some testimony
   of his faith and confident assent to them.

   After which it is proper (if the person be in capacity) that the
   minister examine him, and invite him to confession, and all the parts
   of repentance, according to the foregoing rules; after which he may
   pray the prayer of absolution.

   O Lord Jesus Christ, who hath given commission to his church, in his
   name to pronounce pardon to all that are truly penitent, he of his
   mercy pardon and forgive thee all thy sins, deliver thee from all evils
   past, present, and future, preserve thee in the faith and fear of his
   holy name to thy life's end, and bring thee to his everlasting kingdom,
   to live with him for ever and ever. Amen.

   Then let the sick man renounce all heresies, and whatsoever is against
   the truth of God or the peace of the church, and pray for pardon for
   all his ignorances and errors, known and unknown.

   After which let him (if all other circumstances be fitted) be disposed
   to receive the blessed sacrament, in which the curate is to minister
   according to the form prescribed by the church.

   When the rites are finished, let the sick man, in the days of his
   sickness, be employed with the former offices and exercises before
   described; and when the time draws near of his dissolution, the
   minister may assist by the following order of recommendation of the
   soul.

    I.

   O holy and most gracious Saviour Jesus, we humbly recommend the soul of
   thy servant into thy hands, thy most merciful hands; let thy blessed
   angels stand in ministry about thy servant, and defend him from the
   violence and malice of all his ghostly enemies; and drive far from
   hence all the spirits of darkness. Amen.

    II.

   Lord, receive the soul of this thy servant; enter not into judgment
   with thy servant, spare him whom thou hast redeemed with thy most
   precious blood; deliver him from all evil, for whose sake thou didst
   suffer evil and mischief; from the crafts and assaults of the devil,
   from the fear of death, and from everlasting death, good Lord, deliver
   him. Amen.

    III.

   Impute not unto him the follies of his youth, nor any of the errors and
   miscarriages of his life; but strengthen his in his agony; let not his
   faith waver, nor his hope fail, nor his charity be disordered; let none
   of his enemies imprint upon him any afflictive or evil phantasm; let
   him die in peace, and rest in hope, and rise in glory. Amen.

    IV.

   Lord, we know, and believe assuredly, that whatsoever is under thy
   custody cannot be taken out of thy hands, nor by all the violences of
   hell robbed of thy protection: preserve the work of thy hands; rescue
   him from evil; take into the participation of thy glories him to whom
   thou hast given the seal of adoption, the earnest of the inheritance of
   the saints. Amen.

    V.

   Let his portion be with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; with Job and David,
   with the prophets and apostles, with martyrs and all thy holy saints,
   in the arms of Christ, in the bosom of felicity, in the kingdom of God,
   to eternal ages. Amen.

   These following prayers are fit also to be added to the foregoing
   offices in as there be no communion or intercourse but prayer.

   Let us Pray.

   O almighty and eternal God, there is no number of thy days, or of thy
   mercies; thou hast sent us into this world to serve thee, and to live
   according to thy laws; but we by our sins have provoked thee to wrath,
   and we have planted thorns and sorrows round about our dwellings; and
   our life is but a span long and yet very tedious, because of the
   calamities that enclose us in on every side; the days of our pilgrimage
   are few and evil; we have frail and sickly bodies, violent and
   distempered passions, long designs and but a short stay, weak
   understandings and strong enemies, abused fancies, perverse wills. O
   dear God, look upon us in mercy and pity; let not our weaknesses make
   us to sin against thee, nor our fear cause us to betray our duty, nor
   our former follies provoke thy eternal anger, nor the calamities of
   this world vex us into tediousness of spirit and impatience; but let
   thy Holy Spirit lead us through this valley of misery with safety and
   peace, with holiness and religion, with spiritual comforts and joy in
   the Holy Ghost; that, when we have served thee in our generations, we
   may be gathered unto our fathers, having the testimony of a holy
   conscience in the communion of the catholic church, in the confidence
   of a certain faith, and the comforts of a reasonable, religious, and
   holy hope, and perfect charity with thee our God and all the world;
   that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
   powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth,
   nor any other creature, may be able to separate us from the love of
   God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

    II.

   O holy and most gracious Saviour Jesus, in whose hands the souls of all
   faithful people are laid up till the day of recompence, have mercy upon
   the body and soul of this thy servant, and upon all thy elect people
   who love the Lord Jesus and long for his coming, Lord, refresh the
   imperfection of their condition with the aids of the Spirit or grace
   and comfort, and with the visitation and guard of angels, and supply to
   them all their necessities known only unto thee; let them dwell in
   peace, and feel thy mercies pitying their infirmities, and the follies
   of their flesh, and speedily satisfying the desires of their spirits;
   and when thou shalt bring us all forth in the day of judgment, O then
   show thyself to be our Saviour Jesus, our advocate, and our judge.
   Lord, then remember that thou hast for so many ages prayed for the
   pardon of those sins which thou art then to sentence. Let not the
   accusations of our consciences, nor the calumnies and aggravation of
   devils, nor the effects of thy wrath, press those souls which thou
   lovest, which thou didst redeem, which thou dost pray for; but enable
   us all, by the supporting hand of thy mercy, to stand upright in
   judgment. O Lord, have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us; O Lord, let
   thy mercy lighten upon us, as our trust is in thee. O Lord, in thee
   have we trusted; let us never be confounded. Let us meet with joy, and
   for ever dwell with thee, feeling thy pardon, supported with thy
   graciousness, absolved by thy sentence, saved by thy mercy, that we may
   sing to the glory of thy name eternal hallelujahs. Amen. Amen. Amen.

   Then may be added in the behalf of all that are present those
   ejaculations.

   O spare us a little, that we may recover our strength before we go
   hence and be no more seen. Amen.

   Cast us not away in the time of age; O forsake us not when strength
   faileth. Amen.

   Grant that we may never sleep in sin or death eternal, but that we may
   have our part of the first resurrection, and that the second death may
   not prevail over us. Amen.

   Grant that our souls may be bound up in the bundle of life; and in the
   day when thou bindest up thy jewels remember thy servants for good, and
   not for evil, that our souls may be numbered amongst the righteous.
   Amen.

   Grant unto all sick and dying Christians mercy and aids from heaven;
   and receive the souls returning unto thee, whom thou hast redeemed with
   thy most precious blood. Amen.

   Grant unto thy servants to have faith in the Lord Jesus, a daily
   meditation of death, a contempt of the world, a longing desire after
   heaven, patience in our sorrows, comfort in our sicknesses, joy in God,
   a holy life, and a blessed death; that our souls may rest in hope, and
   my body may rise in glory, and both may be beatified in the communion
   of saints, in the kingdom of God, and the glories of the Lord Jesus.
   Amen.

   The Blessing.

   Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,
   that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
   covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working
   in you that which is pleasing in his sight; to whom be glory, for ever
   and ever. Amen.

   The Doxology.

   To the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings, and the Lord of
   lords, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man
   can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see, be honour and
   power everlasting. Amen.

   After the sick man is departed, the minister, if he be present, or the
   major-domo, or any other fit person, may use the following prayers in
   behalf of themselves: --

    I.

   Almighty God, with whom do live the spirits of them that depart hence
   in the Lord, we adore thy majesty, and submit to thy providence, and
   revere thy justice, and magnify thy mercies, thy infinite mercies, that
   it hath pleased thee to deliver this our brother out of the miseries of
   this sinful world. Thy counsels are secret, and thy wisdom is infinite;
   with the same hand thou hast crowned him, and smitten us; thou hast
   taken him into regions of felicity, and placed him among saints and
   angels, and left us to mourn for our sins; and thy displeasure, which
   thou hast signified to us by removing him from us to a better, a far
   better place. Lord, turn thy anger into mercy, thy chastisements into
   virtues, thy rod into comforts; and do thou give to all his nearest
   relatives comforts from heaven, and a restitution of blessings equal to
   those which thou hast taken from them. And we humbly beseech thee of
   thy gracious goodness shortly to satisfy the longing desires of those
   holy souls who pray, and wait, and long for thy second coming.
   Accomplish thou the number of thine elect, and fill up the mansions in
   heaven which are prepared for all them that love the coming of the Lord
   Jesus; that we, with this our brother, and all others departed this
   life in the obedience and faith of the Lord Jesus, may have our perfect
   consummation and bliss in thy eternal glory, which never shall have
   ending. Grant this for Jesus Christ's sake, our Lord and only Saviour.
   Amen.

    II.

   O merciful God, father of our Lord Jesus, who art the first fruits of
   the resurrection, and by entering into glory hath opened the kingdom of
   heaven to all believers, we humbly beseech thee to raise us up from the
   death of sin to the life of righteousness; that being partakers of the
   death of Christ, and followers of his holy life, we may be partakers of
   his Spirit and of his promises; that when we shall depart this life we
   may rest in his arms, and lie in his bosom, as our hope is this our
   brother doth. O suffer us not, for any temptation of the world, or any
   snares of the devil, or any pains of death, to fall from thee. Lord,
   let thy Holy Spirit enable us with his grace to fight a good fight with
   perseverance, to finish our course with holiness, and to keep the faith
   with constancy unto the end, that at the day of judgment we may stand
   at the right hand of the throne of God, and hear the blessed sentence
   of Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared
   for you from the beginning of the world.' O blessed Jesus, thou art our
   judge, and thou art our advocate; even because thou art good and
   gracious, never suffer us to fall into the intolerable pains of hell,
   never to lie down in sin, and never to have our portion in the
   everlasting burning. Mercy, sweet Jesus, mercy. Amen.

   A Prayer to be said in the Case of sudden Surprise by Death, as by a
   mortal Wound, or evil Accidents in Childbirth, when the Forms and
   Solemnities of Preparation cannot be used.

   O most gracious Father, Lord of heaven and earth, Judge of the living
   and the dead, behold thy servants running to thee for pity and mercy in
   behalf of ourselves and this thy servant, whom thou hast smitten with
   thy hasty rod and a swift angel; if it be thy will, preserve his life,
   that there may be place for his repentance and restitution; O spare him
   a little, that he may recover his strength before he go hence and be no
   more seen. But if thou hast otherwise decreed, let the miracles of thy
   compassion and thy wonderful mercy supply to him the want of the usual
   measures of time, and the periods of repentance, and the trimming of
   his lamp; and let the greatness of the calamity be accepted by thee as
   an instrument to procure pardon for those defects and degrees of
   unreadiness which may have caused this accident upon thy servant. Lord,
   stir up in him a great and effectual contrition, that the greatness of
   the sorrow, and hatred against sin, and the zeal of his love to thee,
   may in a short time do the work of many days. And thou, who regardest
   the heart and the measures of the mind more than the delay and the
   measures of time, let it be thy pleasure to rescue the soul of thy
   servant from all the evils he hath deserved, and all the evils that he
   fears: that in the glorifications of eternity, and the songs which to
   eternal ages thy saints and holy angels shall sing to the honour of thy
   mighty name and invaluable mercies, it may be reckoned among thy
   glories that thou hast redeemed this soul from the dangers of the
   eternal death, and made him partaker of the gift of God, eternal life,
   through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

   If there be time, the prayers in the foregoing offices may be added,
   according as they can be fitted to the present circumstances.

  SECTION VIII.

    Peroration concerning the Contingencies and Treatings of our departed
    Friends after Death, in order to their Burial, etc.

   When we have received the last breath of our friend, and closed his
   eyes, and composed his body for the grave, then seasonable is the
   counsel of the Son of Sirach: Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and
   use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be
   evil spoken of; and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness. But take no
   grief to heart; for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him
   good, but hurt thyself. [185] Solemn and appointed mournings are good
   expressions of our dearness to the departed soul, and of his worth, and
   our value of him; and it hath its praise in nature, and in manners, and
   in public customs; but the praise of it is not in the Gospel, that is,
   it hath no direct and proper uses in religion. For if the dead did die
   in the Lord, then there is joy to him; and it is an ill expression of
   our affection and our charity to weep uncomfortably at a change that
   hath carried my friend to the state of a huge felicity. But if the man
   did perish in his folly and his sins, there is indeed cause to mourn,
   but no hopes of being comforted; for he shall never return to light, or
   to hopes of restitution; therefore, beware lest thou also come into the
   same place of torment; and let thy grief sit down, and rest upon thy
   own turf, and weep till a shower springs from thy eyes to heal the
   wounds of thy spirit; turn thy sorrow into caution, thy grief for him
   that is dead to thy care for thyself who art alive, lest thou die and
   fall like one of the fools whose life is worse than death, and their
   death is the consummation of all felicities. The church in her funerals
   of the dead used to sing psalms, and to give thanks for the redemption
   and delivery of the soul from the evils and dangers of mortality; and
   therefore we have no reason to be angry when God hears our prayers, who
   call upon him to hasten his coming, and to fill up his numbers, and to
   do that which we pretend to give him thanks for. And St. Chrysostom
   asks, "To what purpose is it that thou singest, Return unto thy rest, O
   my soul,' etc., if thou dost not believe thy friend to be in rest? and
   if thou dost, why dost thou weep impertinently and unreasonable?"
   Nothing but our own loss can justly be deplored; and him that is
   passionate for the loss of his money or his advantages we esteem
   foolish and imperfect; and therefore have no reason to love the
   immoderate sorrows of those who too earnestly mourn for their dead,
   when, in the last resolution of the inquiry, it is their own evil and
   present or feared inconveniences they deplore; the best that can be
   said of such a grief is, that those mourners love themselves too well.
   Something is to be given to custom, something to fame, to nature, and
   to civilities, and to the honour of the deceased friends; for that man
   is esteemed to die miserable for whom no friend or relative sheds a
   tear [186] or pays a solemn sigh. I desire to die a dry death, but am
   not very desirous to have a dry funeral: some flowers sprinkled upon my
   grave would do well and comely; and a soft shower to turn those flowers
   into a springing memory, or a fair rehearsal, that I may not go forth
   of my doors as my servants carry the entrails of beasts.

   But that which is to be faulted in this particular is when the grief is
   immoderate and unreasonable; and Paula Romana deserved to have felt the
   weight of St. Jerome's severe reproof, when at the death of every of
   her children she almost wept herself into her grave. But it is worse
   yet, when people by an ambitious and a pompous sorrow, and by
   ceremonies invented for the ostentation of their grief, fill heaven and
   earth with exclamations, and grow troublesome because their friend is
   happy, or themselves want his company. It is certainly a sad thing in
   nature to see a friend trembling with a palsy, or scorched with fevers,
   or dried up like a potsherd with immoderate heats, and rolling upon his
   uneasy bed without sleep, which he cannot be invited with music, or
   pleasant murmurs, or a decent stillness; nothing but the servants of
   cold death, poppy and weariness, can tempt the eyes to let their
   curtains down; and then they sleep only to taste of death, and make an
   essay of the shades below: and yet we weep not here; the period and
   opportunity for tears we choose when our friend is fallen asleep, when
   he hath laid his neck upon the lap of his mother, and let his head down
   to be raised up to heaven. This grief is ill-placed and indecent. But
   many times it is worse; and it hath been observed, that those greater
   and stormy passions do so spend the whole stock of grief that they
   presently admit a comfort and contrary affection, while a sorrow that
   is even and temperate goes on to its period with expectation and the
   distances of a just time. The Ephesian woman that the soldier told of
   in Petronius was the talk of all the town, and the rarest example of a
   dear affection to her husband. She descended with the corpse into the
   vault, and there, being attended with her maiden, resolved to weep to
   death, or die with famine, or a distempered sorrow: from which
   resolution nor his, not her friends, nor the reverence of the principal
   citizens, who used the entreaties of their charity and their power,
   could persuade her. But a soldier that watched seven dead bodies
   hanging upon trees just over against this monument crept in, and awhile
   stared upon the silent and comely disorders of the sorrow; and having
   let the wonder awhile breathe out at each other's eyes, at last he
   fetched his supper and a bottle of wine with purpose to eat and drink,
   and still to feed himself with that sad prettiness. His pity and
   first-draught of wine made him bold and curious to try if the maid
   would drink; who, having many hours since felt her resolution faint as
   her wearied body, took his kindness, and the light returned into her
   eyes, and danced like boys in a festival: and fearing lest the
   pertinaciousness of her mistress's sorrows should cause her evil to
   revert, or her shame of approach, essayed whether she would endure to
   hear an argument to persuade her to drink and live. The violent passion
   had laid all her spirits in wildness and dissolution, and the maid
   found them willing to be gathered into order at the arrest of any new
   object, being weary of the first, of which, like leeches, they had
   sucked their fill, till they fell down and burst. The weeping woman
   took her cordial, and was not angry with her maid, and heard the
   soldier talk; and he was so pleased with the change, that he who first
   loved the silence of the sorrow was more in love with the music of her
   returning voice, especially which himself had strung and put in tune:
   and the man began to talk amorously, and the woman's weak head and
   heart were soon possessed with a little wine, and grew gay, and talked,
   and fell in love; and that very night, in the morning of her passion,
   in the grave of her husband, in the pomps of mourning, and in her
   funeral garments, married her new and stranger-guest. For so the wild
   foragers of Lybia, being spent with heat, and dissolved by the too fond
   kisses of the sun, do melt with their common fires, and die with
   faintness, and descend with motions slow and unable to the little
   brooks that descent from heaven in the wilderness; and when they drink
   they return into the vigour of a new life, and contract strange
   marriages; and the lioness is courted by a panther, and she listens to
   his love, and conceives a monster that all men call unnatural, and the
   daughter of an equivocal passion and of a sudden refreshment. And so
   also was it in the cave at Ephesus: for by this time the soldier began
   to think it was fit he should return to his watch and observe the dead
   bodies he had in charge: but when he ascended from his mourning
   bridal-chamber, he found that one of the bodies was stolen by the
   friends of the dead, and that he was fallen into an evil condition,
   because, by the laws of Ephesus, his body was to be fixed in the place
   of it. The poor man returns to his woman, cries out bitterly, and in
   her presence resolves to die to prevent his death, and in secret to
   prevent his shame: but now the woman's love was raging like her former
   sadness, and grew witty, and she comforted her soldier, and persuaded
   him to live, lest by losing him who had brought her from death and a
   more grievous sorrow, she should return to her old solemnities of
   dying, and lose her honour for a dream, or the reputation of her
   constancy without the change and satisfaction of an enjoyed love. The
   man would fain have lived if it had been possible, and she found out
   this way for him; that he should take the body of her first husband,
   whose funeral she had so strangely mourned, and put it upon the gallows
   in the place of the stolen thief; he did so, and escaped the present
   danger to possess a love which might change as violently as her grief
   had done. But so have I seen a crowd of disordered people rush
   violently and in heaps, till their utmost border was restrained by a
   wall, or had spent the fury of the first fluctuation and watery
   progress, and by and by it returned to the contrary with the same
   earnestness, only because it was violent and ungoverned. A raging
   passion is this crowd, which, when it is not under discipline and the
   conduct of reason, and the proportions of temperate humanity, runs
   passionately the way it happens, and by and by as greedily to another
   side, being swayed by its own weight, and driven any whither by chance
   in all its pursuits, having no rule but to do all it can, and spend
   itself in haste, and expire with some shame and much indecency.

   When thou hast wept awhile, compose the body to burial; which that it
   be done gravely, decently, and charitably, we have the example of all
   nations to engage us and of all ages of the world to warrant: so that
   it is against common honesty and public fame and reputation not to do
   this office.

   It is good that the body be kept veiled and secret, and not exposed to
   curious eyes, or the dishonours wrought by the changes of death
   discerned and stared upon by impertinent persons. When Cyrus was dying,
   he called his sons and friends to take their leave, to touch his hand,
   to see him the last time, and gave in charge, that when he had put his
   veil over his face no man should uncover it: and Epiphanius's body was
   rescued from inquisitive eyes by a miracle. Let it be interred after
   the manner of the country, and the laws of the place, and the dignity
   of the person. For so Jacob was buried with great solemnity, and
   Joseph's bones were carried into Canaan after they had been embalmed
   and kept four hundred years; and devout men carried St. Stephen to his
   burial, making great lamentation over him. And Elian tells that those
   who were the most excellent persons were buried in purple; and men of
   an ordinary courage and fortune had their graves only trimmed with
   branches of olive and mourning flowers. But when Marc Anthony gave the
   body of Brutus to his freed-man to be buried honestly, he gave also his
   own mantle to be thrown into his funeral pile: and the magnificence of
   the old funeral we may see largely described by Virgil in the obsequies
   of Misenus, and by Homer in the funeral of Patroclus, It was noted for
   piety in the men of Jabesh-Gilead, that they showed kindness to their
   lord, Saul, and buried him; and they did it honourably. And our blessed
   Saviour, who was temperate in his expense, and grave in all the parts
   of his life and death, as age and sobriety itself, yet was pleased to
   admit the cost of Mary's ointment upon his head and feet, because she
   did it against his burial; and though she little thought it had been so
   nigh, yet because he accepted it for that end he knew he had made her
   apology sufficient: by which he remarked it to be a great act of piety,
   and honourable, to inter our friends and relatives according to the
   proportions of their condition, and so to give a testimony of our hope
   of their resurrection. [187] So far is piety; beyond it may be the
   ostentation and bragging of a grief, or a design to serve worse ends.
   Such was that of Herod, when he made too studied and elaborate a
   funeral for Aristobulus whom he had murdered; and of Regulus for his
   boy, [188] at whose pile he killed dogs, nightingales, parrots, and
   little horses; and such also was the expense of some of the Romans,
   who, hating their left wealth, gave order by their testament to have
   huge portions of it thrown into their fires, bathing their locks, which
   were presently to pass through the fire, with Arabian and Egyptian
   liquors and balsam of Judea. In this, as in every thing else, as our
   piety must not pass into superstition or vain expense, so neither must
   the excess be turned into parsimony, and chastised by negligence and
   impiety to the memory of their dead.

   But nothing of this concerns the dead in real and effective purposes;
   nor is it with care to be provided for by themselves: but it is the
   duty of the living. [189] For to them it is all one [190] whether they
   be carried forth upon a chariot or a wooden hier; whether they rot in
   the air or in the earth; whether they be devoured by fishes or by
   worms, by birds or by sepulchral dogs, by water or by fire, or by
   delay. When Criton asked Socrates how he would be buried, he told him,
   I think I shall escape from you, and that you cannot catch me; but so
   much of me as you can apprehend, use it as you see cause for and bury
   it; but, however, do it according to the laws. There is nothing in this
   but opinion and the decency of fame to be served. When it is esteemed
   an honour and the manner of blessed people to descend into the graves
   of their fathers, there also it is reckoned as a curse to be buried in
   a strange land, or that the birds of the air devour them. [191] Some
   nations used to eat the bodies of their friends, and esteemed that the
   most honoured sepulture; but they were barbarous. The magi never buried
   any but such as were torn of beasts. The Persians besmeared their dead
   with wax, and the Egyptians with gums and with great art did condite
   the bodies and laid them in charnel-houses. But Cyrus the elder would
   none of all this, but gave command that his body should be interred,
   not laid in a coffin of gold or silver, but just into the earth from
   whence all living creatures receive birth and nourishment, and whither
   they must return. Among Christians the honour which is valued in the
   behalf of the dead is, that they be buried in holy ground; that is, in
   appointed cemeteries in places of religion, there were the field of God
   is sown with the seeds of the resurrection. [192] that their bodies
   also may be among the Christians, with whom their hope and their
   portion is and shall be for ever. "Quicquid feceris, omnia haec eodem
   ventura sunt." That we are sure of: our bodies shall all be restored to
   our souls hereafter, and in the interval they shall all be turned into
   dust, by what way soever you or your chance shall dress them. Licinus
   the freed-man slept in a marble tomb, [193] but Cato in a little one,
   Pompey in none; and yet they had the best fate among the Romans, and a
   memory of the biggest honour. And it may happen that to want a monument
   may best preserve their memories, while the succeeding ages shall, by
   their instances, remember the changes of the world, and the dishonours
   of death, and the equality of the dead: and James the Fourth, [194]
   king of the Scots, obtained an epitaph for wanting of a tomb; and King
   Stephen is remembered with a sad story, because four hundred years
   after his death his bones were thrown into a river that evil men might
   sell the leaden coffin. It is all one in the final event of things.
   [195] Ninus the Assyrian had a monument erected, whose height was nine
   furlongs, and the breadth ten, saith Diodorus: but John the Baptist had
   more honour when he was humbly laid in the earth between the bodies of
   Abdias and Elizeus. And St. Ignatius, who was buried in the bodies of
   lions, and St. Polycarp, who was burned to ashes, shall have their
   bones and their flesh again with greater comfort than those violent
   persons who slept among kings, having usurped their thrones when they
   were alive, and their sepulchres when they were dead.

   Concerning doing honour to the dead, the consideration is not long.
   Anciently the friends of the dead used to make their funeral orations,
   [196] and what they spake of greater commendation was pardoned upon the
   accounts of friendship; but when Christianity seized upon the
   possession of the world, this charge was devolved upon priests and
   bishops, and they first kept the custom of the world, and adorned it
   with the piety of truth and of religion; but they also so ordered it,
   that it should not be cheap; for they made funeral sermons only at the
   death of princes or of such holy persons, who shall judge the angels.
   The custom descended, and in the channels mingled with the veins of
   earth through which it passed; and now-a-days men that die are
   commended at a price, and the measures of their legacy is the degree of
   their virtue. But these things ought not so to be: the reward of the
   greatest virtue ought not to be prostitute to the doles of common
   persons, but preserved like laurels and coronets, to remark and
   encourage the noblest things. Persons of an ordinary life should
   neither be praised publicly nor reproached in private; for it is an
   office and charge of humanity to speak no evil of the dead (which, I
   suppose, is meant concerning things not public and evident;) but then
   neither should our charity to them teach us to tell a lie, or to make a
   great flame from a heap of rushes and mushrooms, and make orations
   crammed with the narrative of little observances, and acts of civil,
   and necessary, and eternal religion.

   But that which is most considerable is, that we should do something for
   the dead, something that is real and of proper advantage. That we
   perform their will, the laws oblige us, and will see to it; but that we
   do all those parts of personal duty which our dead left unperformed,
   and to which the laws do not oblige us, is an act of great charity and
   perfect kindness: and it may redound to the advantage of our friends
   also, that their debts be paid even beyond the inventory of their
   movables.

   Besides this, let us right their causes and assert their honour. When
   Marcus Regulus had injured the memory of Herennius Senecio, Metius
   Carus asked him what he had to do with his dead? and became his
   advocate after death, of whose cause he was patron when he was alive.
   And David added this also, that he did kindnesses to Mephibosheth for
   Jonathan's sake; and Solomon pleaded his father's cause by the sword
   against Joab and Shimel. And certainly it is the noblest thing in the
   world to do, an act of kindness to him whom we shall never see, but yet
   hath deserved it of us, and to whom we would do it if he were present;
   and unless we do so our charity is mercenary, and our friendships are
   direct merchandise, and our gifts are brocage: but what we do to the
   dead or to the living for their sakes is gratitude, and virtue for
   virtue's sake, and the noblest portion of humanity.

   And yet I remember, that the most excellent prince Cyrus, in his last
   exhortation to his sons upon his death-bed, charms them into peace and
   union of hearts and designs, by telling them that his soul would be
   still alive, and therefore fit to be revered and accounted as awful and
   venerable as when he was alive: and what we do to our dead friends is
   not done to persons undiscerning as a fallen tree, but to such who
   better attend to their relatives, and to greater purposes, though in
   other manner, than they did here below. And therefore those wise
   persons, who in their funeral orations made their doubt with an ei tis
   aisphnsiz toiz teteleutnkosi teri ton enphase gegnomenon, "If the dead
   have any perception of what is done below," which are the words of
   Isocrates, in the funeral encomium of Evagoras, did it upon the
   uncertain opinion of the soul's immortality; but made no question if
   they were living they did also understand what could concern them. The
   same words Nazianzen uses at the exequies of his sister Gorgonia, and
   in the former invective against Julian: but this was upon another
   reason; even because it was uncertain what the state of separation was,
   and whether our dead perceive anything of us, till we shall meet in the
   day of judgment. If it was uncertain then, it is certain since that
   time we have had no new revelation concerning it; but it is ten to one
   but when we die we shall find the state of affairs wholly differing
   from all our opinions here, and that no man or sect hath guessed
   anything at all of it as it is. here I intend not to dispute, but to
   persuade; and therefore, in the general, if it be probable that they
   know or feel the benefits done to them, though but by a reflex
   revelation from God, or some under-communication from an angel, or the
   stock of acquired notices here below, it may the rather endear us to
   our charities or duties to them respectively; since our virtues use not
   to live upon abstractions, or inducements, but then thrive when they
   have material arguments, such which are not too far from sense.
   However, it be, it is certain they are not dead; and though we no more
   see the souls of our dead friends than we did when they were alive, yet
   we have reason to believe them to know more things and better; and if
   our sleep be an image of death, we may also observe concerning it, that
   it is a state of life so separate from communications with the body,
   that it is one of the ways of oracle and prophecy [197] by which the
   soul best declares her immortality, and the nobleness of her actions
   and powers, if she could get free from the body, (as in the state of
   separation, or a clear dominion over it,) as in the resurrection. To
   which also this consideration may be added, that men a long time live
   the life of sense before they use their reason; and till they have
   furnished their head with experiments and notices of many things, they
   cannot at all discourse of anything: but when they come to use their
   reason, all their knowledge is nothing but remembrance; and we know by
   proportions, by similitudes and dissimilitudes, by relations and
   oppositions, by causes and effects, by comparing things with things;
   all which are nothing but operations of understanding upon the stock of
   former notices, of something we knew before, nothing but remembrances:
   all the heads of topics, which are the stock of all arguments and
   sciences in the world, are a certain demonstration of this; and he is
   the wisest man that remembers most, and joins those remembrances
   together to the best purposes of discourses. From whence it may not be
   improbably gathered, that in the state of separation, if there be any
   act of understanding, that is, if the understanding be alive, it must
   be relative to the notices it had in this world; and therefore the acts
   of it must be discourses upon all the parts and persons of their
   conversation and relation, excepting only such new revelation which may
   be communicated to it; concerning which we know nothing. But if by
   seeing Socrates I think upon Plato, and by seeing a picture I remember
   a man, and by beholding two friends I remember my own and my friend's
   need; (and he is wisest that draws lines from the same centre, and most
   discourses from the same notices;) it cannot be very probable to
   believe, since the separate souls understand better if they understand
   at all, that from the notices they carried from hence, and what they
   find there equal or unequal to those notices, they can better discover
   the things of their friends, than we can here by our conjectures and
   craftiest imaginations and yet many men here can guess shrewdly at the
   thoughts and designs of such men with whom they discourse, or of whom
   they have heard, or whose characters they prudently have perceived. I
   have no other end in this discourse, but that we may be witnesses of
   our transient affections and forgetfulness. Dead persons have religion
   passed upon them, and a solemn reverence; and if we think a ghost
   beholds us, it may be we have upon us the impressions likely to be made
   by love, and fear, and religion. However, we are sure that God sees us,
   and the world sees us; and if it be matter of duty towards our dead,
   God will exact it; if it be matter of kindness, the world will: and as
   religion is the band of that, so fame and reputation are the endearment
   of this.

   It remains, that we who are alive should so live, and by the actions of
   religion attend the coming of the day of the Lord, that we neither be
   surprised nor leave our duties imperfect, nor our sins uncancelled, nor
   our persons unreconciled, nor God unappeased; but that, when we descend
   to our graves, we may rest in the bosom of the Lord, till the mansions
   be prepared where we shall sing and feast eternally. Amen.

   To Deum laudamus.

   THE END.

       manu pretia, procurationes, officiorumque per officia processus,
       cum interim ad latus mors est; quae quoniam nunquam cogitatur nisi
       aliena, subinde nobis ingerantur morialitatis exempla, non diutius
       quam miramur hasura.--Seneca.: [265]1
     * Ne tamen ad Stygias famulus descenderet umbras, Ureret implicitum
       cum scelerata lues, Cavimus: [266]1
     * Nec tamen putaverant ad rem pertinere, ubi inciperent, quod

       parente omnium, constitutum.: [270]1
     * Nihil infelicius eo eui nihil unquam contigit adversi. Non licuit
       illi se experii.: [271]1
     * Nihil sibi quisquame de futuro debet promittere. Id quoque, quod
       tenetur, per manus exit, et ipsam quam premimus, horam casus
       incidit. Volvitur tempus rata quidem lege, sed per
       obscurum.--Seneca.: [272]1
     * Nola quad cupio statim senere, Nec victoria mi placet parata.:
       [273]1
     * Non acccpimus brevem vitam, sed fecimus; nec inopes ejus sed
       prodigi sumus.: [274]1

       levitatis, sed saepe etiam tristes firmitate et constantia sunt

       animo mecum ante peregi.: [279]1
     * Nunc festinatos nimium sibi sentit honores, Actaque lauriferae
       damnat Syllana juventae.: [280]1
     * Nune si depositum non inficiatur amicus, So reddat veterem cum tota
       aerugine follem, Prodigicsa fides et Thuscis digna libellis.:
       [281]1
     * Omnia, crede mihi, etiam felicibus dubia sunt.: [282]1
     * Omnino si quicquan est decorum, mibil est profecto magis quam
       acquabilitas univerae vitae, turn singularum actionem; quam autem
       conservare non possis, si aliorum naturam imitans omittas tuam.:
       [283]1

     * Quem si inter miseros posueris, miserrimus; inter felices,
       felicissimus reperiebatur.: [289]1
     * Qui homo culpam admisit in se, nullus est tam parvi pretis quin
       pudent, quin purget sese.: [290]1
     * Qui levi comminatione pellitur, non opus est, ut fortitudin et
       armis invadatur.: [291]1
     * Qui quotidie vit suae manum imposuit, non indiget tempore.: [292]1
     * Quia lex cadem manet omnes, Gemitum dare sorte sub una, Cognataque
       funera nobis Aliena in morte dolere. Prud. Hymn. Exequiis
       Defunctor.: [293]1
     * Quicquid feceris, omnia haec eodem ventura sunt.: [294]1
     * Quid brevi fortes jaculamur evo Multa?: [295]1
     * Quid debent laesi facere, ubi rei ad paenam confugiunt?: [296]1
     * Quid sit futurum cras, fuge querere, et Quem fors dierum cunque
       debit, lucro Appone.: [297]1
     * Quis sapiens bono Confidat fragili? dum licet, utere:: [298]1

     * Saevi quoque et implacabiles domini crudelitatem suam impediunt,
       si, quando paenitentia fugitivos reduxit, dedititiis hostibus

     * Sanctiusque ae reverentius visum de actis Deorum credere quam

       occupatorum animi velut sub jugo sunt, respicere non possunt.:
       [305]1
     * Sed potes, Publi, geminare magna Sccula fama. Quem sui raptum
       gemuere cives, Hie diu vixit. Sibi quisque famam Scribat haeredem:
       rapiunt avarae aetera Lunae.: [306]1
     * Si sapis, utaris totis, Colme, diebus; Extremumque tibi semper
       adese putes.: [307]1

       vulnus suum fratri et magistro voluerit confiteri, magister qui
       linguam habet ad curandum, facile ci prodesse non poterit. Si enim
       erubeseat aegrotus vulnus medico coniteri, quod ignorat medicina
       non curat. St. Hierom. ad caput 10. Ecces. Si enim hoc fecerimus,
       et revelaverimus peccata nostra non sol im Deo, sed et his qui

       peccata nostra.: [308]1
     * Sic longius aevum Destruit ingentes animos, et vita superstes

       praevertit trista leto, Dedecori est fortuna prior.: [309]1
     * Summum futuri judieli praejudicium est, si quis ita deliquert ut a
       communicatione orationis et conventus et oranis sancti commercii
       relegetur.: [310]1
     * Tantum doluerunt, quantum doloribus se inserueruent.: [311]1
     * Tentaris numeros, ut melius, quicquid erit, pati, Seu plures
       hyemes, seu tribuit Jupiter ultimam.: [312]1
     * Totus hic locus contemneudus est in nobis, non negligendus in
       nostris.: [313]1
     * Tu milhi, quod rarum est, vivo sublime dedisti Nomen, ab exsequiis
       quod dare fama solet.: [314]1

       inopi lingua desertas invocat artes.: [321]1
     * Vinum Dominicum ministratoris gratia est : [322]1
     * Virtutes avidae periculi monstrant, quam non paeniteat tanto pretio

     * cerno equidem gemina constratos morte Phillippos, Thessaliaeque
       rogos, et fun eta gentis Iberae.: [325]1
     * concedendum est gementi.: [326]1
     * homines precarit spiritus et male haerentis : [327]1
