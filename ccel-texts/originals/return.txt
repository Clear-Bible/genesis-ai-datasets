                                    Foreword

   This book is designed mainly for those who are beginners in the study
   of prophetic and dispensational truth, though should it fall into the
   hands of those who are "looking for that blessed hope and the glorious
   appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ" and who have,
   perhaps for years, been giving earnest heed to the "more sure Word of
   prophecy," we trust that it will afford meat in due season and
   stimulate praise to God for the marvelous and blessed prospect which
   His Word sets before us.

   Many books have already appeared before the public presenting in clear
   and Scriptural language the various aspects of the subject of our
   Lord's Return, and we hesitated long before we decided to add one more
   to the number. The different chapters in this volume have been given by
   the writer in sermon and lecture form to numerous audiences both in
   this country and in England, and it is only the repeated requests of
   many of those who have heard these addresses which has caused us to now
   set them down in writing; so that they may be preserved in a more
   permanent form and obtain a still wider hearing. They are sent forth
   with the prayer that the God of all grace will condescend to use them
   in blessing to His dear people and in the conversion of lost sinners
   even more widely than in their oral delivery.

   While it is true that many books which treat of the Redeemer's Return
   have been issued and widely circulated, yet, there are still great
   numbers of the Lord's people who know next to nothing about this
   precious theme. Notwithstanding the fact that the Second Coming of
   Christ occupies a prominent place in the Holy Scriptures,
   notwithstanding the fact that this subject is a most practical one
   having, as it does, some bearing on every phase of our present and
   future life, and notwithstanding that it is calculated to awaken a deep
   interest in "things to come" and lead to definite heart-searching
   nevertheless, the vast majority of our pulpits entirely ignore the
   subject and in consequence great numbers of our church-members are in
   almost total ignorance concerning those things which God's Word
   declares will shortly come to pass. It is with the earnest desire to
   reach a few of these that this book has been prepared and is now sent
   forth.

   We wish it to be clearly understood that there is nothing in these
   pages except that which we have ourselves first received. We lay no
   claim at all to originality. We have read diligently many works on
   prophetic themes and have sought to "prove all things" and to "hold
   fast that which is good." It is impossible for us now to do more than
   make this general acknowledgment of our indebtedness to other students
   of the Word. We have gleaned in many fields, gathering a fragrant
   flower here and there, and all that we now attempt is to arrange these
   in simple form, leaving our readers to admire the products of the
   labors of others into which we have entered.

                                  Introduction

   The Redeemer's Return! Here is a theme which in this day is regarded by
   many well-meaning people as an ideal of visionaries or as the pet hobby
   of certain cranks. So grievously has the study of Prophecy been
   ignored, so little place is given in the modern pulpit to the
   exposition of eschatology, and so generally is the daily reading of the
   Bible neglected by those in the pew, that it is an easy matter to
   persuade the average church-goer that the subject of the Second Coming
   of Christ is impractical and one that had better be left alone.
   Moreover, this subject has suffered so grievously at the hands of those
   who are the enemies of the Cross, that many Christians have been
   prejudiced against it. Satan has not been slow to avail himself of the
   wild and unscriptural teaching of such men as Irving and Joseph Smith,
   and more recently, Dowie and Pastor (?) Russell; nay, he has employed
   them to cast reproach on those who do seek to search and interpret the
   Prophetic Scriptures. Yet, notwithstanding, it is the imperative duty
   of every believer to seriously and prayerfully examine the Scriptures
   for himself and see what the Word of God has to say about Coming
   Events. In that Word we are plainly warned that in the "last days" (of
   this age) there should arise those who ridicule and mock at the very
   doctrine of which we are now speaking (see 2 Pet. 3:3, 4). Therefore we
   need not be surprised if we hear and read of those who seek to cast
   reproach upon this blessed theme; instead, as the Dispensation draws to
   a close, we should expect just what we now hear and see on every side.

   The Redeemer's Return! Is there anything that can be compared with this
   momentous and stupendous prospect? Excepting the Cross of Calvary, the
   greatest event of all in the past history of the world was the Advent
   of God's Son to our earth. The Divine Incarnation was the theme of Old
   Testament prophecy. The very first promise ever given to fallen man was
   that the woman's Seed should come and bruise the Serpent's head (Gen.
   3:15). When the Divine revelation was committed to writing, numerous
   passages recorded the promised descent of God's Son to this earth. The
   prophets of Israel made known the fact that the Coming One was to be of
   the stock of Abraham and a lineal descendant of David, and thus for
   fifteen centuries the Hope of Israel was the Messianic Hope. And, when
   the fullness of time was come God sent forth His Son born of a woman.

   It is impossible for us to fully estimate the tremendous importance of
   the first Advent of Christ to this earth, The Divine Incarnation is
   without a parallel in the annals of the human race. Heaven itself was
   stirred at the miraculous birth of the God-Man. Unto the angels was
   entrusted the honorous commission of announcing the birth of the
   Saviour. Heathendom was affected, the good news being conveyed to
   Chaldea by means of a mysterious "star" which heralded the birth of the
   King of the Jews. The Coming of Christ to this world changed its
   chronology, for all civilized time is now by common consent dated from
   the Bethlehem manger. As the result of the first Advent a new era was
   inaugurated, a new prospect was set before the sons of men, the door of
   mercy was flung wide open, and command was given that the glad tidings
   should be made known to every creature.

   But wondrous and blessed as was the first Advent of our Lord in many
   respects, His Second Coming will be even more momentous. At His first
   appearing He was here in weakness and humiliation, but at His second He
   shall come in power and glory. When He was here before He was "despised
   and rejected of men," but when He comes back again every knee shall bow
   before Him and every tongue confess His Lordship. When He was here
   before He paid tribute to Caesar, but when He returns He shall reign as
   King of Kings and Lord of lords. When He was here before His personal
   ministry was confined to the land of Palestine, but when He returns
   "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,
   as the waters cover the sea" (Hab. 2:14). Who can comprehend or
   enumerate the blessings which shall attend the Return of our Redeemer!
   Then will it be that the "dead in Christ" shall be raised from their
   graves and the living saints "changed," so that every believer will
   then be "conformed to the image of God's Son." Then it will be that the
   Lord's servants will be rewarded for their labors and those that were
   despised and hated by the world shall be recognized and honored by the
   Christ of God. Then it will be that Israel shall repent of their sins,
   receive Christ as their Messiah and Saviour, and be restored to the
   Holy Land. Then will the promise made to the patriarchs be literally
   and completely fulfilled. Then it will be that that old Serpent the
   Devil shall be removed from these scenes where he has wrought such
   havoc and produced such misery, to be chained for a thousand years in
   the Bottomless Pit. Then it will be that a groaning Creation shall be
   delivered from its present bondage, when the Curse which now rests upon
   all Nature shall be removed, and when the wilderness and the solitary
   place shall be made glad; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as
   the rose (Is. 35:1). And, best of all, then it shall be that Christ
   Himself shall enter into His blood-brought inheritance, when He shall
   see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied. Therefore, ought not
   such a subject, which presents such a glorious prospect, gladden our
   hearts and secure our most diligent attention!

   God does not desire His dear people to remain in ignorance of His
   future purposes concerning them, concerning His Son, and concerning
   this earth. Said the apostle as he was moved by the Holy Spirit, "We
   have also a more sure Word of Prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye
   take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day
   dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts" (2 Pet. 1:19). If then we
   give diligent heed to the Prophetic Word, if we will prayerfully study
   that which God has been pleased to reveal unto us concerning things to
   come, and if we will believe in our hearts all that the prophets have
   spoken, then shall we be like the Thessalonians of whom it could be
   said--"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
   I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the
   Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace
   and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
   woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren are not
   in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all
   the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the
   night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others, but
   let us watch and be sober" (1 Thess. 5:1-6).

   The Redeemer's Return! This was the great hope of the early Christians.
   In the first century of the Christian era it was the normal and regular
   thing to find that the expectation of the returning Saviour filled the
   vision and hearts of His followers. The apostles themselves taught
   their converts to look for the appearing of Christ. Writing to the
   Thessalonian saints the apostle Paul reminded them how they had "turned
   to God from idols to serve the living and true God; and to wait for His
   Son from heaven" (1 Thess. 1:9, 10). Writing to the twelve tribes
   scattered abroad, the apostle James bade them be patient and stablish
   their hearts, basing his exhortation on the fact that "The Coming of
   the Lord draweth nigh" (Jas. 5:8). Writing to "the strangers scattered
   throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia "who were in
   heaviness through manifold temptations," the apostle Peter expressed
   the wish that the trial of their faith "might be found unto praise and
   honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ"(1 Pet. 1:7). Writing
   to his "little children" (a term of endearment) the apostle John
   lovingly exhorted them to abide in Christ so that when He should appear
   they might have confidence and "not be ashamed before Him at His
   coming" (1 John 2:28). Writing of the apostasy which was to come, the
   apostle Jude quoted the prophecy of Enoch, who declared, "Behold, the
   Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon
   all" (Jude 1:14, 15). Thus we find that it was the uniform practice of
   the apostles to hold up a returning Saviour before the children of God.

   Right at the close of the first century A. D. when the time had come
   for the Sacred Canon to be completed, our Lord Himself sent His angel
   to communicate a special message to each of the seven Churches which
   were in Asia, and in five of them, namely, in the Epistles addressed to
   the Churches in Ephesus, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis and Philadelphia
   (see Rev. 2:5, 16, 25; 3:3, 11) Christ makes distinct reference to His
   imminent appearing, while His last words to His loved disciple were,
   "Surely I come quickly" (Rev. 22:20).

   We have thus shown that this Age began with a ringing testimony to the
   truth of our Lord's Return. Each of the apostles, of whose writings we
   have any inspired record, taught their converts to look for their
   Saviour's appearing. Alas! that this testimony was not maintained.
   Alas! that this Blessed Hope should ever have become dim. Alas! that it
   should, for more than a thousand years, have been almost totally lost
   to the Lord's people. Yet so it was. The immediate successors of the
   apostles turned their attention to other things: as it was with the
   Pharisees in the days of our Lord, so these tithed anise and mint but
   "omitted the weightier matters." Instead of expounding the Prophetic
   Scriptures and setting before the Church its one great Hope, the early
   "Church Fathers," for the most part, spent their time in wrangling
   among themselves. Even before the apostles themselves had left the
   earth, false teachers crept in and began to devour the flock, and
   within three centuries the whole professing Church had become
   Paganized. Then followed the Dark Ages--aptly named, for the lamp of
   Prophecy had ceased to shine and the prospect of the speedy return of
   the Morning Star had completely disappeared. As our Lord Himself had
   foretold, the virgins all slumbered and slept: no longer were His
   people looking for the Coming of the Bridegroom. [1]

   We need not remind our readers it was during this period known as the
   Dark Ages that the Roman Catholic Church sprang into prominence and the
   power, holding sway over all Europe and binding burdens on the souls of
   men which were grievous to be borne. The Bible was withheld from the
   laity and the vain traditions of men were substituted for the living
   Oracles of God. Instead of proclaiming salvation by the finished work
   of Christ, the multitudes were taught that heaven could only be
   obtained by penance, legal works, priestly mediation, and purgatorial
   fires. Instead of teaching her people that the hope of the saints was
   the appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Rome taught
   that the hope of humanity lay in the subjugation of the entire world to
   the imperial rule of the Pope. Instead of exhorting believers to "look
   up" (Luke 21:28), the Roman Pontiff sought to dazzle the eyes of his
   devotees with the gorgeous ceremonialism of an earthly ritual.

   After a thousand years of spiritual darkness the Sun of Righteousness
   shone forth over Europe with healing in His beams. During the sixteenth
   century God raised up a number of mighty men who, by the power of His
   Spirit, were delivered from the iron shackles of the Papacy and made to
   rejoice in the freedom into which, the Lord Jesus brings His people.
   Under God, these men brought about what is known as the great
   Reformation. During this Reformation the Holy Scriptures were restored
   to the people and given to them in their own native tongues. The
   glorious doctrine of Justification by Faith alone, was sounded forth
   throughout Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the British Isles, and
   multitudes were "added unto the Lord." Many precious truths, which for
   long centuries had lain buried beneath the rubbish heap of human
   traditions, were recovered and given out to the masses. But the
   Reformation, glorious as it was, witnessed only a partial recovery of
   long lost truths. The Hope of the Church was not yet restored! The
   prospect of a soon returning Redeemer was not yet set before God's
   people again. Three more centuries passed by before the third part of
   our Lord's prophecy in the Parable of the Virgins received its
   fulfillment. It was not until the nineteenth century that the midnight
   cry arose "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him" (Matt.
   25:6). Then it was that God raised up another band of witnesses, sent
   forth by Him to herald the approach of His Son. The result has been
   that an ever increasing number of the saints have given studious
   attention to the prophetic portions of the Word, until, to-day, in
   every section of Christendom, there are companies of believers who are
   eagerly waiting for the Shout of the Lord which shall call them away
   from this earth to be for ever with Him. It is our humble desire to
   unite with these witnesses of God in testifying that the Coming of the
   Lord "draweth nigh." The Signs of the times speak plainly to those who
   have ears to hear, and singly and collectively bear witness to the fact
   that this Dispensation of Grace is now almost ended. The prophecies of
   the New Testament show clearly that we are living in the "last days" of
   this Age, and by the help of the Spirit of Truth we would herein call
   attention to those Scriptures which make known to us the stupendous
   events which shall surely and shortly come to pass.

   [1] No doubt the parable of the Bridegroom in Matthew 25 refers
   primarily to the Jewish remnant in the tribulation period as its
   opening word "Then" indicates, but, like all prophecy, this has a
   double fulfillment and unquestionably applies to the Christian
   profession.

                                  Chapter One

                       The Need of the Redeemer's Return

   Is there any real need for Christ to return? So far as God's children
   are concerned only one answer is possible to this question. There is.
   Christians of every shade of religious belief are agreed that there is
   an imperative need for our Lord to come back again. As to the precise
   character of that need, as to the particular urgency of that need,
   opinions may vary, but concerning the need itself this is universally
   admitted. Even post-millennarians teach that Christ must come back at
   the end of time to judge the wicked and reward the righteous. But we
   hope to show that the need for His return is much deeper and much wider
   than the reason put forth by the post-millennarians.

   Suppose Christ never returns--then what? Has this alternative been
   weighed as it deserves? The present order of things cannot continue
   indefinitely; such a supposition is unthinkable. No one is satisfied
   with present conditions. Even those who despise the teachings of God's
   Word, hope for a better day, a Golden Age, an era of blessedness, such
   as this earth has never yet witnessed. And pre-millennarians believe
   that this Golden Age can be ushered in by nothing short of the personal
   return of Christ Himself. Here then, in general, is the reason why we
   believe the Redeemer must come back again. We say "in general," for in
   the remainder of this chapter we shall seek to show there is at least a
   tenfold necessity for our Lord's Second Advent.
     __________________________________________________________________

I. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE DECLARATIONS OF OLD TESTAMENT
PROPHECY.

   It is very apparent to any one who has read thoughtfully through the
   Old Testament that the First Advent of our Lord did not exhaust the
   burden and scope of the numerous predictions which had been made
   concerning Him. Many of the things foretold of Israel's Messiah were
   not accomplished during the days when He tabernacled among men. Many of
   the promises found in God's Word connected with the Person of Christ,
   still await their ratification. While it is true that the First Advent
   of the Lord Jesus literally and remarkable fulfilled many of the Old
   Testament prophecies concerning Him, yet, it is also true that many
   others were not then fulfilled. [2] To several of these we shall now
   call our readers attention.

   "And I will put enmity between thee (the "serpent") and the woman, and
   between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
   bruise his heel" (Gen. 3:15). There is much in this remarkable verse
   which we cannot now consider in detail, yet we will endeavor to present
   an outline of its contents. This is not a single prophecy but a
   compound one and at least seven separate predictions are included in
   it:--

   First, the woman is to have a seed: as we know, this pointed forward to
   our Lord's humanity. Second, He was to be peculiarly the woman's
   "seed," not the man's, hence we read, "When the fullness of time was
   come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman" (Gal. 4:4, Greek).
   Third, the woman's "Seed" was to bruise the Serpent: in other words,
   Satan was to be His particular antagonist. Fourth, He was to bruise the
   Serpent's head. Fifth, He Himself was to be bruised in the "heel" by
   the Serpent; and hence it is written, He was "bruised for our
   iniquities" (Is. 53:5). Sixth, there was to be "enmity" between the
   Serpent and the one who gave birth to the "Seed," namely Israel (cf.
   Rev. 12:1-6). And then, after making mention of the enmity between the
   Serpent and the woman, we read, Seventh, "And between thy seed--the
   Serpent's "seed," i.e., the Son of Perdition--and her "Seed." In other
   words, this agelong "enmity" was to head up in a conflict between the
   Antichrist and the true Christ. For our present purpose it is
   sufficient to single out the fourth and fifth of the above items,
   which, in their historical order, have been reversed.

   "Thou shalt bruise His heel." That old Serpent the Devil was to be
   permitted to attack and wound the only vulnerable part of our Lord's
   person--His humanity, here intimated by the word "heel." How this
   portion of the prophecy was fulfilled our readers will know. No sooner
   was the Lord Jesus born in Bethlehem of Judaea than the "Dragon" sought
   to encompass His destruction (Rev. 12:4). Immediately following His
   baptism, which was the inauguration of His public ministry, He was
   tempted or "tried" by the Devil for forty days (Mark 1:13). On the eve
   of His crucifixion our Lord expressly declared, "This is your hour, and
   the Power of Darkness: (Luke 22:53). Thus was Satan allowed to bruise
   the "heel" of the woman's Seed.

   But we also read, "It shall bruise thy head," that is, Christ shall
   bruise Satan's "head." The head is the seat and source of power, and in
   the Scripture we are now considering is placed in sharp antithesis with
   the "heel" of the woman's Seed. Stripped of its prophetic symbolism, it
   can only mean that Christ is to depose Satan and reduce him to a state
   of impotency. This interpretation is fully confirmed in Rev. 20 where
   we learn that a day is coming when the Devil shall be bound and cast
   into the Bottomless Pit to remain there securely confined throughout
   the Millennial Era. What we now desire to emphasize particularly is,
   that, this part of the Edenic prophecy was not fulfilled when our Lord
   was upon earth before, and has not yet been fulfilled. Therefore, if
   this prediction is be realized our Lord must return to this earth and
   deprive the Devil of his power, for He alone is competent for such a
   task.

   Again; we read in Is. 9:6, 7, "For unto us a Child is born, unto us a
   Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His
   name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the
   Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His
   government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David,
   and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment
   and with justice from henceforth even for ever." Here again we meet
   with a prophecy which has already received a partial fulfillment, but
   which has not yet been completely realized. Unto Israel a Child was
   "born," unto Israel a Son was "given;" but, during the days of His
   First Advent the "government" for He is not yet seated upon His
   own"throne: (see Rev. 3:21). Observe particularly that, above, it is
   repeated "of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no
   end." His "government" and "peace" are inseparably connected. The
   latter part of this prophecy therefore looks forward to the time of His
   Second Advent, for "When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and
   all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His
   glory" (Matt. 25:31). Then will it be that He shall inaugurate a Reign
   of Peace, for then it shall be (and not till then) that "He shall judge
   among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall
   beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into
   pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither
   shall they learn war any more" (Micah 4:3). Thus we see that the
   declarations of the Prophetic Word require and necessitate the personal
   return of Christ to this earth, for only thus and only then will they
   be literally and completely fulfilled. Many other Old Testament
   predictions could be cited to the same effect, but one more must
   suffice.

   "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a
   righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
   judgment and justice in the earth. In His days Judah shall be saved,
   and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is His name whereby He shall be
   called, the Lord our Righteousness. Therefore, behold, the days come,
   saith the Lord, that they shall no more say, the Lord liveth, which
   brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; But, the
   Lord liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of
   Israel out of the North country, and from all countries whither I had
   driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land" (Jer. 23:5-8). In
   the first place, observe, here, that unto David (Israel) God promised
   to raise up a King who should reign and prosper. Without a doubt this
   prophecy refers to our Lord Jesus Christ who was born "King of the
   Jews" (Matt. 2:2), for it was uttered shortly after the Jews were
   carried down into Babylon, since which they have had no human King. It
   needs no argument to prove that the terms of this prophecy were
   certainly not fulfilled at the time of our Lord's First Advent, for
   then, the Jews would not own Him, but demanded His death, and when
   Pilate inquired of them, "Shall I crucify your King?" (John 19:15), the
   leaders of the nation answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
   Furthermore, this prophecy was not fulfilled when our Lord took His
   seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high, for note, it says that
   Israel's King shall "execute judgment and justice in the earth," not
   "from the heavens." Again; we observe that it declares, "In His days
   Judah shall be saved, and Israel (the ten tribes) shall dwell safely"
   which certainly did not come to pass during the days of our Lord's
   humiliation. No; this prophecy, like scores of other Messianic
   predictions recorded in the Old Testament, looks forward to the time of
   our Lord's Second Advent to the earth, which Advent is imperative if
   the terms of this prophecy are to be realized.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] It is this very thing which has proven such a stumbling-block to
   the Jews and humanly speaking, has been the reason why so many of them
   have failed to see in "Jesus of Nazareth" the Messiah of Israel. But,
   as we shall show above, those Messianic prophecies found in the Old
   Testament which were not fulfilled at His first Advent will be
   fulfilled at His Second.
     __________________________________________________________________

II. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY HIS OWN AFFIRMATIONS.

   During the course of His public ministry our Lord made frequent
   reference to His Second Coming. When we consider how few of His
   discourses have been transmitted to us and how brief is the inspired
   record of His teachings as found in the New Testament Scriptures, we
   are deeply impressed with the importance of our present inquiry as we
   note how much there is in the Gospel narratives which relates to our
   Redeemer's Return. Not only do we find many incidental references, but
   most of His "parables" treat of those things which have to do with His
   Second Advent, and, furthermore, several whole chapters in the Gospels
   are devoted to a fuller setting forth of the same great event. Unto our
   Lord's own teaching, then, upon His Second Coming we turn our
   attention. We cannot now review all that He said upon the subject, but
   must content ourselves with singling out two or three of His utterances
   thereon.

   In Matt. 24 and 25 we have two whole chapters occupied with this theme,
   and in them we find that again and again our Lord made mention of His
   Return--"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
   unto the west: so shall also the coming of the Son of man be" (24:27),
   which means that our Lord's Return to this earth will be visible,
   public, and attended with awe-inspiring glory. The same ideas are
   presented in the 30th verse of the same chapter--"And then shall appear
   the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of
   the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds
   of heaven with power and great glory." Further down in the chapter, our
   Lord bids His people make preparation for His appearing because He may
   return at any moment. "Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour
   as ye think not the Son of Man cometh" (vs. 44). In the next chapter,
   in the Parable of the Virgins, the subject of the Bridegroom's Coming
   is again brought before us, while the closing verses furnish us with a
   detailed description of His judgment of the living nations which
   introduces the setting up of His Millennial Kingdom--"When the Son of
   Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then
   shall He sit upon the throne of His glory: and before Him shall be
   gathered all nations: and He shall separate them one from another, as a
   shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats" (Matt. 25:31, 32).

   In the nineteenth of Luke we have the Parable of the Nobleman which is
   very plain and pointed: "He said therefore, A certain nobleman went
   into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. And
   He called His ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said
   unto them, Occupy till I come. But his citizens hated Him, and sent a
   message after Him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.
   And it came to pass, that when He was returned, having received the
   kingdom, then He commanded these servants to be called unto Him, to
   whom He had given the money, that He might know how much every man had
   gained by trading" (Luke 19:12-15). The "Nobleman" is the Lord Jesus.
   The "journey into the far country" was His Ascension to heaven. The
   "Kingdom" which He went to "receive" is His Millennial Kingdom for
   which He taught His disciples to pray. The "return" is His Second
   Advent to this earth. The "servants" are believers. The "money" (marg.
   "silver," which in Scripture symbolizes redemption) seems to typify the
   Gospel, which has been committed into our hands to proclaim to a lost
   world. The "occupying till He comes" is the faithful giving out of the
   Gospel and the daily witnessing for Him during the time of His absence.
   The "message" sent by "His citizens" refers to the continued rejection
   of Christ and His Gospel by the Jews during the days of the apostles
   and particularly under the ministry of Stephen. The rewarding of the
   servants at the time of His Return, is the allotting to them of places
   of honor in His Millennial Kingdom. That to which we would specially
   call attention is the fact that our Lord here expressly declares He
   will "return," come back again to this earth.

   Perhaps the most explicit of all the statements which the Lord Jesus
   made upon our present theme is that recorded in the opening verses of
   John 14. Our Lord was alone with His disciples. He was about to be
   separated from them. For three years they had companied with Him, but
   now the cross with all its suffering and shame lay athwart His path.
   The realization of His approaching death had filled His followers with
   fear and anguish. Their hearts were heavy and sad. Turning to them in
   their grief, the Master speaks words of solace and cheer--"Let not your
   heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My
   Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told
   you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place
   for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I
   am, there ye may be also" (John 14:1-3). These words of our Lord can
   have only one possible meaning: He was going away, but He would return
   again, return in person to receive His own unto Himself. Such was His
   positive and unconditional promise. Thus we see that the fulfillment of
   His promises, the keeping of His Word, necessitates the personal Return
   of our blessed Redeemer.

   The testimony of our Lord given while He was here upon earth was
   confirmed, and rendered even more unequivocal, if that were possible,
   by His post-ascension utterances. Fifty years after He had returned to
   heaven the Lord Jesus sent His angel to the beloved John on the Isle of
   Patmos to give unto him "The Revelation" and in it we hear our Lord
   saying, no less than six times, "Behold, I come quickly." This is His
   last promise, His final word to His people now on earth. He is coming
   back again. He Himself has said so. He said so repeatedly during the
   days of His earthly ministry. He said so in language about which there
   was no ambiguity whatsoever. He said so both to His friends and to His
   enemies. He said so again fifty years after His ascension to heaven.
   And He cannot lie. He is Himself the "Truth"--the Truth incarnate. He
   is "The Faithful and True Witness," therefore He must keep His Word,
   fulfill His promises, and Return in person.

III. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE RATIFICATION OF THE HOLY
SPIRIT.

   While our Lord was here upon earth and on the eve of His crucifixion,
   He promised to send His disciples another Comforter, even the Spirit of
   Truth. He further promised the apostles that, when the Spirit came to
   them, He would guide them "into all truth." Therefore, it is to the
   Divinely inspired writings of these apostles we must turn if we would
   learn all that God has been pleased to reveal concerning our present
   inquiry.

   As we read the Epistles of the New Testament it is highly important for
   us to keep in mind the fact that we have in them not the suppositions
   and speculations of their human writers but reliable and authoritative
   information communicated by the Holy Spirit Himself, for "All Scripture
   is given by inspiration of God" (2 Tim. 3:16). As we turn to the
   Epistles we find that each writer made some contribution to our present
   theme: Peter and Paul, James, John, and Jude all referred to the
   prospect and certainty of the Return of our Redeemer.

   The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian saints, "I thank my God always
   on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus
   Christ; that in every thing ye are enriched by Him, in all utterance,
   and in all knowledge; even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in
   you. So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our
   Lord Jesus Christ: who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may
   be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor. 1:4-8). To
   the Philippian saints he wrote, "For our citizenship is in heaven; from
   whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall
   change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious
   body, according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all
   things unto Himself" (Phil. 3:20, 21). To the Colossians he wrote,
   "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
   with Him in glory" (Col. 3:4). To the Thessalonians he wrote, "For what
   is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the
   presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?" (1 Thess. 2:19). To
   the Hebrews he wrote, "So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
   many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time
   without sin unto salvation" (9:28).

   The apostle James wrote, "Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the
   coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious
   fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the
   early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for
   the coming of the Lord draweth nigh" (5:7, 8).

   The apostle Peter wrote, "Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be
   sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you
   at the revelation of Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 1:13). "And when the Chief
   Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth
   not away" (1 Pet. 5:4).

   The apostle John wrote, "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it
   doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall
   appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And every
   man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure"
   (1 John 3:2, 3). And again, "For many deceivers are gone forth into the
   world, even they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the
   flesh" (2 John 7, R. V.).

   The apostle Jude wrote, "Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking
   for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life" (vs. 21).

   Here then is an argument simple but conclusive. Each Epistle writer of
   the New Testament makes mention of the Redeemer's Return. These men
   were not hallucinated. They were not giving expression to impracticable
   ideals which would never be realized. Their writings were Divinely
   inspired. These holy men were "moved by the Holy Spirit" and recorded
   truth "not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy
   Spirit teacheth" (1 Cor. 2:13). The very fact, then, that the Holy
   Spirit of God has, through the apostles, testified again and again,
   ratifying the declarations of Old Testament prophecy and affirmations
   of Christ Himself, necessitates and demands the personal Return of our
   Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

IV. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE HUMILIATION OF THE CROSS.

   The degradation which the Lord Jesus endured when He was here upon
   earth before, requires that He shall come back again in power and glory
   in order to vindicate Himself. Is it reasonable to suppose that the
   last view which this world shall have of our blessed Lord before He
   takes His seat upon the Great White Throne to judge the wicked dead,
   shall be that of the "lowly Nazarene"? Surely not. Need we remind our
   readers of the depths of humiliation into which our Redeemer descended?
   Born in a manger, with the beasts of the field for His first
   companions, and a bed of straw for His cradle! Sharing the home of
   humble Jewish peasants and spending His youth and early manhood at the
   carpenter's bench! During His public ministry, so poor and so lightly
   esteemed that the common courtesies of hospitality were denied Him--"He
   had not where to lay His head!" Despised and rejected of men; the butt
   of Pharisaic contempt and the center of Jewish ridicule! His life
   seemingly ending in defeat as He hung helpless upon the cross, enduring
   the shame of a criminal's execution and taunted by his heartless
   enemies! Is this the only sight which the earth is to have of the Lord
   of Glory? Is the Son of God to retire from this world in apparent
   defeat without any subsequent opportunity for vindicating Himself?
   Surely not. Is it not evident then that He who was here before in
   humiliation must yet come back to be glorified in His saints and to be
   admired in all them that believe? Does not the very fitness of things,
   do not the claims of equity and righteousness, insist, that He who was
   the willing Victim shall yet return as the triumphant Victor? Does not
   the Cross of Calvary necessitate that our Lord shall yet come back to
   our earth in order to substantiate His claims and ratify His promises?

   "For dogs have compassed Me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed
   Me: they pierced My hands and My feet. I may tell all My bones: they
   look and stare upon Me. They part My garments among them, and cast lots
   upon My vesture" (Ps. 22:16-18). Such was the picture that was painted
   by prophecy. But this scene was not to be the finale. In this very same
   Psalm we read, "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto
   the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
   Thee. For the kingdom is the Lord's: and He is the Governor among the
   nations"(vss. 27, 28).

   "And they that had laid hold on Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high
   priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled" (Matt. 26:57).
   See our blessed Lord standing there before the Jewish Sanhedrim,
   arraigned before His own creatures! Mark Him as He offers no defense in
   response to the false witnesses that testified against Him, and then
   ask, Is this to be the last thing? Is there to be no sequel to this? We
   do not have to seek far for an answer, for on this very occasion the
   Redeemer declared, "Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see
   the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the
   clouds of heaven"(Matt. 26:64). And again, it is written, "Behold, He
   cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which
   pierced Him." Yes, the Crucified Saviour is coming back again, coming
   back to vindicate Himself in a world where He once endured the
   contradiction of sinners against Himself, and, coming back to rule and
   reign as He first appeared in order to suffer and die.

V. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE PRESENT EXALTATION OF SATAN.

   One of the greatest mysteries in all God's creation is the Devil. For
   any reliable information concerning him we are shut up to the Holy
   Scriptures. It is in God's Word alone that we can learn anything about
   his origin, his personality, his fall, his sphere of operations, and
   his approaching doom. One thing which is there taught us about the
   great Adversary of God and man, and which observation and experience
   fully confirms, is, that he is a being possessing mighty power. It
   would appear, from a study of the Bible, that Satan is the most
   powerful creature(not "Being") in all the Universe. He has access to
   the Heaven of heavens and appears before God day and night to accuse
   His saints (Rev. 12:10). In Old Testament prophecy he is denominated
   "The anointed Cherub" (Ezek. 28:14) and from other Scriptures we learn
   that the "cherubim" are the highest order among the celestial
   hierarchies. Satan is represented as being at the head of an organized
   kingdom of evil, with hosts of wicked spirits ever ready to perform the
   bidding of their mighty chief. He is likened to a "roaring lion"--the
   King of the beasts--going about seeking whom he may devour (1 Pet.
   5:8). When our Lord was here upon earth, Satan had the power to carry
   Him to a pinnacle of the Temple and to "shew unto Him all the kingdoms
   of the world in a moment of time"(Luke 4:5). From the Epistle of Jude
   we learn that, "Michael the archangel, when contending with the Devil
   he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a
   railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee" (Jude 1:9).
   Sufficient has been said to show that Satan is a creature wielding
   tremendous power.

   But not only does God's Word enlighten us upon the great power which
   our Enemy possesses, it also informs us about the sphere in which he
   works and makes known the location of his kingdom. In the very first
   mention in Scripture of that old Serpent, the Devil, he is seen in Eden
   having unbarred access to our first parents. In the next reference, we
   read of him coming before the Lord, as one who came "From going to and
   fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it" (Job 1:7). This
   earth of ours is the scene of his present activities. Milton's
   conception of Satan now seated upon a throne in Hell is altogether
   lacking in Scriptural verification. The New Testament is in perfect
   agreement with the Old. In his conflict with our Lord, the Devil
   declared that all the kingdoms of the world had been delivered unto him
   (Luke 4:6) and Christ never repudiated or even challenged his claim,
   nay, He three times acknowledged that Satan is "The Prince of this
   world" (John 12:31, etc.). In 2 Cor. 4:4 he is termed the "god of this
   age" (Greek), that is, the director of its false religions and the
   object worshipped by their devotees--compare 1 Cor. 10:20. While in 1
   John 5:19, R. V. we are told, "The whole world lieth in the Evil One."

   We have thus seen that Satan is an exalted creature possessing and
   wielding prodigious power and that this world of ours is his present
   kingdom. For six thousand years he has been the avowed enemy of God and
   man. But are things going to continue thus throughout all time? Is
   Satan to be allowed "free rein" for ever? Surely there will yet be an
   end made to his power and dominion. But what and who is going to depose
   him? Humanity is helpless before him. Man is unable to chain him. The
   Church cannot dethrone him, or it would have done so long ago.
   Legislation is impotent, for human governments cannot vote him out of
   the world. Who then shall overthrow the Kingdom of Darkness? There is
   only one answer possible. There is only One sufficient for such a task,
   and that is the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, the very fact of Satan's
   present exaltation and man's utter inability to overthrow him, demands
   and necessitates the personal Return of our Redeemer to vanquish the
   Devil and imprison him in the Bottomless Pit.

VI. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE PRESENT DISORGANIZATION OF
ISRAEL.

   Israel--the mystery and miracle of history! Israel--about whom more
   than half the Bible is concerned! Israel--to whom God gave the Land of
   Palestine. Israel--concerning whom it is written, "And the Lord hath
   avouched thee this day to be His peculiar people, as He hath promised
   thee, and that thou shouldest keep all His commandments. And to make
   thee high above all nations which He hath made, in praise, and in name,
   and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the Lord thy
   God as He hath spoken" (Deut. 26:18, 19). Israel--from whom, according
   to the flesh, Christ came!

   Of old, Israel was honored of God as was no other nation. To them were
   entrusted the Holy Oracles, to them was given the Holy Law, to them
   came the Holy One. But look at Israel to-day and what do we see? Ten of
   their Tribes "lost;" and those who compose the remaining two, more
   despised and hated than any other people upon earth. Instead of being a
   blessing to all people, Israel seems to be a curse. Instead of enjoying
   the inheritance of the Promised Land they are homeless wanderers, while
   Jerusalem is trodden down by the Gentiles. Instead of rejoicing in God
   their Saviour Israel knows Him not, a "veil" being over their hearts.

   But God's purposes in connection with Israel have not yet been fully
   realized. A wonderful history lies behind them and a wonderful history
   stretches before them. True, their sorrow is not yet ended. True, a
   dark valley yet lies before them. True, they must yet pass through the
   time of Jacob's trouble (Jer. 30:7). True, God has not yet fully
   avenged the Crucifixion of His beloved Son. But, ere long He will have
   done so, and then shall they be brought back again into favor with Him.
   Many are the promises which speak of Israel's restoration. In Is. 14:1,
   2 we read, "For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
   Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be
   joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. And the
   people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of
   Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and
   handmaids: and they shall take them captive, whose captives they were:
   and they shall rule over their oppressors." Again, in Jer. 16:14-16 we
   are told, "Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it
   shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of
   Israel out of the land of Egypt; But, the Lord liveth, that brought up
   the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all lands
   whither He had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land
   that I gave unto their fathers."

   But, How are the above promises to be realized? When shall these
   prophecies be fulfilled? The answer is, At the Second Advent of Christ.
   He declared, "For I say unto you, Ye shall not see Me henceforth, till
   ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord" (Matt.
   23:39). And a day is coming when Israel will say this. As it is
   written, "And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and
   they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn
   for Him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness
   for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. In that day
   shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of
   Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon" (Zech. 12:10, 11). Then, and
   thus, shall Israel repent for their awful sin of rejecting and
   crucifying their own Messiah.

   "Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to
   take out of them a people for His name. And to this agree the words of
   the prophets; as it is written, after this, I will return, and will
   build again the tabernacle of David (Israel), which is fallen down: and
   I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up" (Acts
   15:14-16). And again, we read in Rom. 11:26, "And so all Israel shall
   be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer,
   and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob" (Rom. 11:26). It is to be
   observed that in these two Scriptures Israel's restoration is linked to
   the Return of their Messiah. Here then is a further necessity for the
   Second Advent of Christ--the present humiliation and disorganization of
   Israel and the promises of God to restore and rehabilitate them,
   requires that our Lord shall come back again to this earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

VII. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE PRESENT DEGRADATION AND
DESOLATION OF THE WORLD.

   Here is a reason which ought to carry conviction to every mind. If
   there is anything which imperatively needs our Redeemer to Return it is
   surely this poor sin-cursed world of ours! Look at it and what do we
   see? A world everywhere racked with suffering and out of joint. A world
   convulsed with misery entailed by the Fall. A world now in its very
   death-throes, with hope almost completely gone. Everything that man
   could devise to better conditions and make this world a happier place
   has been tested and proven a failure. Every possible form of human
   government has been tried, each new one being as unsuccessful as the
   previous ones. Theocracy, democracy, and mobocracy (the French
   Revolution, and Russia today) have each been weighed in the balances
   and found wanting. Legislation, education and civilization have all
   been built upon, only to find in the day of testing that they were
   merely foundations of sand. Look where you will, on land or sea, in the
   air or beneath the waters, and you will witness sin and death holding
   high carnival. The world is dying for want of a competent Ruler.

   On all sides iniquity is abounding more and more. Crime is increasing,
   morality is decreasing; godlessness and lawlessness are growing apace;
   while over all, hangs the dreadful pall of the world-war. In the
   physical world, despite all our enlightenment, modern discoveries and
   the organized activities of medical science, disease is carrying off an
   ever increasing multitude year by year. The educational world is mainly
   under the control of infidels and agnostics, under whose leadership the
   rising generation is taught that the faith once for all delivered to
   the saints is an idle superstition, or at best a religious garment
   which we have now outgrown. In the economic world, greed and dishonesty
   are rapidly eating out the very vitals of commercial stability, while
   the fight between capital and labor threatens a revolution such as this
   world has not witnessed since the days when the streets of Paris ran
   with blood. In the political realm there is so much chicanery, and
   "graft" and "party" principles are so selfishly pursued, that the
   self-respecting man is becoming loath to get mixed up with such filth
   and rottenness. Each "party" is as corrupt as the other, and the
   believer in Christ who is subject to God's Word will not hesitate to
   separate himself from that which offers his Lord no place and has no
   concern for His glory. In the moral realm, decay and putrefaction are
   witnessed upon all sides. Temperance Reform Societies, Purity-campaigns
   and Civic-righteousness Leagues are powerless to stem the tide of evil.
   The Drink-Bill of every civilized (?) nation is growing heavier every
   year. Immorality, both among the masses and those in high places,
   prevails to such a fearful extent, that our large cities are modern
   Sodoms and Gomorrahs. In the religious world, we gaze upon an apostate
   Christendom. Our Theological Seminaries, with very rare exceptions, are
   teaching Darwinism and Higher Criticism, while our pulpits are busily
   occupied with "echoing" these God-dishonoring and Scripture-denying
   heresies, and on all sides the Gospel is supplanted by political
   harangues or moral essays. The majority of our churches are more than
   half empty, while the mid-week prayer meeting is almost entirely a
   thing of the past. The few faithful servants of God that are left on
   earth are boycotted, maligned and persecuted. The Lord's Day has become
   a day of pleasure-seeking and now, Sabbath-desecration, in the form of
   seven days a week work on the farms and in the munition factories, has
   been legalized by every nation that is now at war. And, as we have
   said, over all hangs the dreadful pall of this World War! Literally
   millions of men in the prime of their manhood have already been
   slaughtered, while millions more have been maimed for life in the vain
   effort to destroy militarism and establish a lasting peace. Innumerable
   homes have been plunged into grief, and there is no guarantee or even
   prospect but what millions more will suffer a like fate.

   To-day the world stands helpless before the inrushing tide of evil
   which threatens to decimate almost half of the human race, and in its
   impotency a grief-stricken humanity is everywhere lifting up piteous
   hands to Heaven as it cries for a Deliverer. True, the cry may not
   always be articulated, yet it is audible nevertheless. True, the world,
   as a whole, is blind to its spiritual wretchedness and apostate
   condition. True, the canal mind is still enmity against God, yet,
   intelligent men realize that the present order of things is a complete
   failure and are ready and longing for a New Order. The world cries for
   deliverance, what shall be Heaven's response? Again we say that only
   one answer is possible. While the Holy Scriptures reveal the fact that
   the severest of God's judgments have not yet been poured upon this
   world, which has for so long lived in pleasure and wantonness; while
   the Holy Scriptures reveal the fact that the darkest hour of the night
   of earth's sufferings and sorrows has not yet arrived; yet, they also
   teach, that at the close of this night, the Sun of Righteousness shall
   arise with healing in His wings (Mal. 4:2). "Say to them that are of a
   fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with
   vengeance, even God with a recompense; He will come and save you. Then
   the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall
   be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of
   the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
   streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and
   the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where
   each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. And a highway shall be
   there, and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness; the
   unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the
   wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. No lion shall be
   there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be
   found there: but the redeemed shall walk there: And the ransomed of the
   Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy
   upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and
   sighing shall flee away"(Isa. 35:4-10). That will be Heaven's response
   to earth's agonized cry! Therefore we say that the present degradation
   and desolation of the world necessitates our Redeemer's Return to take
   the government upon His shoulder and to rule and reign in
   righteousness, for then, and not till then, will every world problem
   find its final solution.

VIII. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE LAMENTATION OF ALL CREATION.

   The effects of the Fall have been far-reaching--"By one man sin entered
   the world"(Rom. 5:12). Not only was the entire human family involved
   but the whole "Kosmos" was affected. When Adam and Eve sinned, God not
   only pronounced sentence upon them and the Serpent but He cursed the
   ground as well--"And unto Adam He said, because thou hast hearkened
   unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
   commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, Cursed is the ground
   for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life:
   thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee" (Gen. 3:17, 18).
   These words suggest a solemn and far-reaching line of thought--Sin not
   only brings punishment to the actual transgressor but it also involves
   others in its terrible consequences. The punishment which was meted out
   to the antediluvians was not limited to the human family, it fell upon
   the lower orders of creation as well--all were swept away by the flood!
   The judgments which God sent upon the haughty Pharaoh extended to the
   fishes in the rivers and the cattle in the fields as well as to all his
   subjects! When the Angel of Death passed through the land of the Nile,
   he slew all the first-born of beasts as well as the first-born of the
   Egyptians (Ex. 12:12). When Jehovah's wrath visited the land of
   Palestine in the days of Israel's apostasy it descended upon the animal
   kingdom as well as the human, for we read, "How do the beasts groan!
   the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea,
   the flocks of sheep are made desolate" (Joel 1:18). And again, "How
   long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither for the
   wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the
   birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end" (Jer. 12:4).

   To what extent the entire universe has suffered the evil consequences
   of sin it is impossible to say, but certain it is that they are not
   limited to our earth. Adam was not the first offender, for before his
   fall Satan also had apostatized from his Maker. What other worlds were
   affected by Satan's fall Scripture does not inform us, yet we may infer
   from those principles which are revealed in God's Word that the awful
   consequences of Satan's rebellion were far-reaching in their scope.
   Astronomical observation reveals the fact that there are numbers of
   far-distant worlds upon which no life exists, while Scripture speaks of
   "wandering stars." The moon is a ruined planet where Death holds
   absolute sway and death is the wages of sin. If then Adam's
   transgression brought down upon the earth which he inhabited a curse
   from God, may we not soberly conclude that the fall of the highest of
   all God's creatures brought down a Divine curse upon those worlds over
   which he may have exercised a delegated rulership? Be this as it may,
   Scripture does reveal the fact that the consequences of sin have
   reached far beyond the four corners of our earth. We read "The heavens
   are not clean in His sight" (Job 15:15), and again, in Rom. 8:22 we are
   told, "For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
   pain together until now."

   In the last mentioned Scripture we learn that the whole creation is in
   pain and misery. Surely this is abnormal. Surely things were not like
   this at the beginning, nor were they;' and surely things will not
   continue thus forever, nor will they. We quote now the entire passage
   in which the above statement is found--"For I reckon that the
   sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
   glory which shall be revealed to usward. For the earnest expectation of
   the creation waiteth for the revealing of the Sons of God. For the
   creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of
   Him who subjected it in hope that the creation itself also shall be
   delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory
   of the children of God" (Rom. 8:18-21, R. V.). The order of thought
   here appears to be as follows:- The whole of God's creation, which is
   directly concerned and connected with our earth, (The "whole creation"
   cannnot be taken absolutely for the unfallen angels must be excluded)
   suffered the consequences of Adam's sin, being brought under the
   bondage of corruption as the direct result. But this "bondage" is not
   to last for ever. A hope is set before creation: a promise has been
   given that it shall be "delivered" and in expectation of the
   fulfillment of this promise and the realization of this hope creation
   now "waits." The "hope" of creation is linked with "the manifestation
   of the sons of God" and "the liberty of their glory." The sons of God
   will be manifested or revealed with their Redeemer at the time of His
   Return for it is written "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear,
   then shall ye also appear with Him in glory"(Col. 3:4). It is at the
   Second Coming of Christ, His return in "glory" that His people shall
   enter into the liberty of their glory. Then will it be that creation
   shall be delivered from its present bondage of corruption. Thus we
   learn that though the whole creation has suffered in consequence of
   sin, yet shall it soon share in the glorious benefits of the Death of
   Christ who came to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. How clear
   then is the need of our Redeemer's Return! None but creation's Creator
   (John 1:3) can emancipate it from its sufferings. Hence we say that the
   present lamentations of Creation necessitate and demand the personal
   Return of our Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

IX. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE SUPPLICATIONS OF THE CHURCH.

   While our Lord was here upon earth He gave His disciples a pattern
   prayer saying, "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which
   art in heaven Hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come" (Matt. 6:9, 10).
   The Redeemer taught His saints to look forward to the future, to be
   occupied with God's interests and purposes, and to pray for the coming
   of His Kingdom, i.e., the Millennial Kingdom. Thus we learn that our
   hope has to do, not with the present kingdoms of this world, but with
   the coming Kingdom of God, which hope will be realized at the return of
   the Redeemer Himself. It is clear from a number of Scriptures that the
   coming of God's Kingdom synchronizes with the Return of Christ (see
   Luke 19:12; Rev. 11:15, etc.). The Hope of the Church centers in Christ
   and has to do with the future rather than with the present, for "hope"
   always looks forward. Therefore it is that the prayers of the Church
   must conform to and correspond with its hope.

   The last promise ever made by our Lord, made some fifty or sixty years
   after His ascension, given to the beloved John on the Isle of Patmos
   but recorded for the encouragement and joy of all His people throughout
   the Christian dispensation, was "Surely I come quickly" (Rev. 22:20).
   The response to this promise is the prayer inspired by the Holy Spirit,
   "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." As this dispensation draws to its close
   and as the Return of Christ is daily coming nearer, the Holy Spirit is
   causing many to make this prayer their own. As the result of the
   recovery of the "Blessed Hope" which throughout the Dark Ages was lost
   to the Church, and as the result of the proclamation which is now being
   sounded forth far and wide, "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out
   to meet Him," companies of God's saints all over the earth are now
   daily crying, "Even so Come Lord Jesus." And our God is a
   prayer-hearing and a prayer-answering God! He who has taught so many of
   its members to long and pray for the Return of their Saviour must
   satisfy that longing and answer that prayer. Therefore we say that the
   expectations and supplications of the Church of God which He purchased
   with His own Blood necessitate the personal Return of our Redeemer.
     __________________________________________________________________

X. THE REDEEMER'S RETURN IS NECESSITATED BY THE EXPECTATION OF THE DEAD IN
CHRIST.

   This argument may be summarized thus:--The Intermediate state into
   which the souls of the redeemed pass at death is not the perfect state,
   it is but an "unclothed" (2 Cor. 5:1-3) condition. Like their brethren
   who are still upon earth, those now in Paradise are "waiting for the
   adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body" (Rom. 8:23). A countless
   multitude of those who fell asleep in Jesus are yet in the disembodied
   state, and in that state they are "waiting," waiting for the time when
   this corruptible shall put on incorruption and when this mortal shall
   put on immortality. Those, who while on earth, looked and longed for
   the Return of their Redeemer, and who are still waiting that blest
   event shall not wait thus forever, as it is written, "For the Lord
   Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
   archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise
   first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
   with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
   ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:16, 17).

   In the last book of the Bible, where the veil that separates between
   the present and the future and between this world and the next is
   pulled aside, we find a Scripture that bears closely upon the point now
   under consideration. We refer to Rev. 6:9, 10--"And when he had opened
   the fifth seal, I saw under the alter the souls of them that were slain
   for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held. And they
   cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost
   Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
   This passage, stript of its symbolism, signifies that martyred
   believers now in the Intermediate state are waiting with eager
   expectation the time when God shall avenge their death, which time is
   reached immediately before our Lord returns to this earth. That which
   we wish to specially emphasize is the fact that souls now in Paradise
   are here represented as crying "How long?" Thus we learn that those
   "present with the Lord," as well as believers still "in the body," are
   eagerly expecting and waiting for the time of their Redeemer's Return.
   The answer made to these disembodied "souls" is very striking--"And
   white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto
   them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their
   fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they
   were, should be fulfilled" (Rev. 6:11).

   The "dead in Christ" are waiting in hope, waiting for the fulfillment
   of that promise, "So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown
   in corruption; it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor; it
   is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It
   is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body" (1 Cor.
   15:42-44). Is their hope nothing more than an idle dream? Are they to
   wait thus for ever? No, blessed be God. His Word, declares that at the
   time of our Redeemer's Return, "Them also which sleep in Jesus will God
   bring with Him"(1 Thess. 4:14). Therefore we say that the present
   unclothed condition of the dead in Christ with their expectation of the
   Resurrection morn requires and necessitates the personal Return of our
   Lord.

   To sum up. At least ten reasons require that Christ shall come back
   again -- the declarations of Old Testament prophecy; the affirmations
   of our Lord Himself; the ratification of the Holy Spirit through the
   writers of the New Testament Epistles; the humiliation of the Cross,
   requiring a corresponding vindication of Christ in power and glory; the
   present disorganization of Israel; the exaltation of Satan and the
   powerlessness of man to depose him; the degradation and desolation of
   the world; the lamentations of a Creation waiting to be delivered from
   its bondage of corruption; the supplications of the Church crying "Even
   so, come, Lord Jesus;" and the expectation of the dead in Christ
   waiting for their glorification, singly and collectively necessitate
   and demand the personal Return of our Redeemer.

                                  Chapter Two

                       The Hope of the Redeemer's Return

   In 1 Cor. 13:13 we learn there are three cardinal Christian graces
   namely, faith, hope, and love. Concerning the first and third of these,
   believers, generally, are well informed, but regarding the second, many
   of the Lord's people have the vaguest conceptions. When Christians are
   questioned upon the subject of Faith they are, for the most part, able
   to answer promptly and intelligently; but interrogate the average
   church-member about the believer's Hope, and his replies are indistinct
   and uncertain. Let Christian Love come up for discussion and we all
   feel that we are upon solid ground, but when asked to pursue the theme
   of Christian Hope many step cautiously and hesitatingly.

   That there is the greatest confusion of thought and belief among
   Christians concerning their Hope may readily be proven by questioning a
   number regarding the nature of their hope. Ask the average church-goer
   what his hope is, and he will say, Salvation--he hopes to be saved when
   he comes to die. Ask another and he will tell you that Death is his
   hope, for it is then that he will be released from all the sufferings
   of the flesh. Ask a third and he would say that Heaven was his hope.
   Perhaps this last reply would better express the common and popular
   belief than either of the others. But to say that our hope is future
   happiness, is to say no more than any heathen would say. There are
   several Scriptures which distinguish between Heaven and the believer's
   Hope. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
   according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a living
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an
   inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
   reserved in heaven for you" (1 Pet. 1:3-4). Here the "living hope" unto
   which we have been begotten is separated in thought from the
   "inheritance" which is "reserved in heaven" for us. Though closely
   connected, Heaven and the believer's Hope are certainly not synonymous
   as is clear from Col. 1:5 where they are again distinguished--"For the
   hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the
   word of the truth of the Gospel." Heaven is not here said to be the
   believer's hope, for the hope is "laid up" for him "in heaven." What
   then is our Hope?

   It is strange that there should be such ignorance and confusion upon
   this subject for Hope is made almost as prominent in the New Testament
   as is either Faith or Love. The Church epistles have much to say upon
   the subject. In the epistle to the Romans when setting forth the
   consequences or results of justification, the apostle wrote, "Therefore
   being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we
   stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God" (5:1). And again in
   8:24, 25--"For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not
   hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth? But if we hope for that
   which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it" (R. V.). To the
   Corinthians Paul wrote, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ,
   we are of all men most miserable" (1 Cor. 15:19). To the Galatians he
   wrote, "For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
   faith" (5:5). For the Ephesians he prayed that the eyes of their
   understanding might be enlightened, and that they might know "what is
   the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His
   inheritance in the saints" (Eph. 1:18), and in setting forth the
   sevenfold Unity of the Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of
   your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of
   all" (4:4-6), and there can no more be two different hopes than there
   can be two Lords, or two faiths.

   To the Thessalonian saints the apostle Paul wrote, "Sorrow not, even as
   others which have no hope"(1 Thess. 4:13), and again, "Now our Lord
   Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us,
   and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through
   grace"(2 Thess. 2:16). Unto Titus he wrote, "For the grace of God that
   bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
   godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the
   glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ"
   (Titus 2:11-13). And unto the Hebrews he said, "And we desire that
   every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of
   hope unto the end. ** That by two immutable things, in which it was
   impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have
   fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: which hope we
   have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which
   entereth into that within the veil" (6:11, 18, 19).

   The apostle Peter found cause for rejoicing in that God had "according
   to His abundant mercy, begotten us again unto a living hope by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Pet. 1:3); and again, he
   exhorted his readers to "Be ready always to give an answer to every man
   that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and
   fear" (1 Pet. 3:15).

   The apostle John wrote, "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it
   doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall
   appear we shall be like him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every
   man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure"
   (1 John 3:2, 3). Thus we see that the New Testament abounds in passages
   which speak of the believer's hope."

   In all ages God's people have had a hope set before them, and that hope
   has always centered in Christ. In Eden God gave to Adam the promise
   that the woman's Seed should come and bruise the Serpent's head and the
   anticipation of the fulfillment of this promise constituted the hope of
   the saints in those far-off days. Said Jacob, "I have waited for Thy
   salvation, O Lord" (Gen. 49:18). The Hope that God set before Abram was
   that his "Seed" should be a blessing unto all nations, which hope, as
   we learn from Gal. 3:16, had particular reference to Christ. The Hope
   which God set before Moses was expressed as follows, "I will raise them
   up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put My
   words in His mouth; and He shall speak unto them all that I shall
   command Him" (Deut. 18:18). For the fulfillment of this prophecy see
   John 12:49; 14:10, etc. The Hope which God set before David was stated
   as follows, "And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with
   thy fathers, I will set up thy Seed after thee, which shall proceed out
   of thy bowels, and I will establish His Kingdom. He shall build a house
   for My name, and I will establish the throne of His Kingdom for ever"
   (2 Sam. 7:12, 13). And later, through His prophets, God again and again
   set before Israel the Hope of the appearing of their Messiah. This
   leads us to inquire now into--
     __________________________________________________________________

I. The Character of Our Hope

   As there is so much confusion and uncertainty respecting this branch of
   our subject, and in order to clear away the rubbish which human
   devisings have gathered around it, we will deal first with the negative
   side of the character of our Hope.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. Our Hope is not the Conversion of the World.

   We pray that these pages may be read by many who will be startled by
   the above statement. A world which shall eventually be saved by the
   preaching of the Gospel has been the expectation of almost all
   Christendom. That the Gospel shall yet triumph over the world, the
   flesh, and the Devil is the belief of the great majority of those who
   profess to be the Lord's people. In the seminaries, in the pulpits, in
   the Christian literature of the day, and in the great missionary
   gatherings where placards bearing the words "The world for Christ" are
   prominently displayed, has this theory been zealously heralded. It is
   supposed that anything short of a converted "world" is a concept
   dishonoring and derogatory to the Gospel. We are told the Gospel cannot
   fail because it is the power of God, and though the Church has failed,
   yet, a day is surely coming when this captivating ideal shall be
   realized. To believe other than this, is to be dubbed a "pessimist,"
   yea, it is to be looked upon as a hinderer and traitor to the cause of
   Christ. But what are the plain facts?

   The Lord Jesus Christ preached the Gospel, preached it faithfully,
   lovingly, zealously and untiringly. But with what results? Was the
   world "converted" under His preaching? Should it be said this question
   is not a fair one because He preached only locally, we accept the
   correction, but ask further, Was Palestine converted under His
   preaching? We have only to glance at the four Gospels to find an
   answer. In the Sermon on the Mount, our Lord declared that the "many"
   were on the broad road that leadeth to destruction and that only a
   "few" were on the narrow path that leadeth unto life. In the Parable of
   the Sower He announced that out of four castings of the good seed from
   His hand three of them fell upon unfruitful ground. Again, we are told,
   "He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew
   Him not. He came unto His own, and His own knew Him not. He came unto
   His own, and His own received Him not" (John 1:10, 11). No; the Gospel
   as preached by the Son of God Himself held out no promise of a world
   converted by the proclamation of it, for after three and a half years'
   ministry such as this world has never witnessed before or since, there
   was but a handful who responded to the gracious appeals of the Gospel
   from His lips--there were but one hundred and twenty all told that
   waited in the upper room for the coming of the Holy Spirit which He had
   promised to send to His followers (Acts 1:15).

   How was it in the days of the apostles? During the first generation of
   the Church's history, wonderful things happened which were well
   calculated to convert the world if anything could. Eleven men who had
   been trained by our Lord Himself were now sent forth to herald the glad
   tidings of salvation. The Holy Spirit was poured forth upon them, and
   in addition to the Eleven, Saul of Tarsus was miraculously saved and
   sent forth as the apostle to the Gentiles. But what success attended
   their efforts? How were they received by the world? Again we have but
   to turn to the New Testament Scriptures to find our answer. Like their
   Master, they, too, were despised and rejected of men. The apostles were
   everywhere spoken against and regarded as the offscouring of the earth.
   Some of them were cast into prison, others were slain by the sword. One
   suffered death by crucifixion and the last of the little band was
   banished to the Isle of Patmos. True it is that their labors were not
   entirely in vain. True it is that God honored His own Word and numbers
   were saved, and here and there churches were organized. But the
   multitudes, the great masses, both of Jews and Gentiles, remained
   unmoved and unconverted. The actual conditions, in the days of the
   apostles then, gave no promise of a world converted by the Gospel.

   How is it in our own day? "Ah!" it will be said "times have changed
   since then: Christ and His apostles lived in the days of Paganism and
   barbarism, but under the enlightenment of our modern civilization this
   twentieth century is far otherwise." Yes, but all is not gold that
   glitters. We do not deny, we praise God for the fact, that to-day there
   are far more Christians upon earth than there were in the first
   century. But there are far more sinners too! What we are discussing now
   is the Conversion of the world. Has the growth of the Church of God
   kept pace with the increase of the earth's population? We trow not.
   To-day there are probably 1,000,000,000 souls on earth who have never
   even heard the name of Christ! How then can we talk about a converted
   world when upwards of two-thirds of humanity is destitute of the
   Gospel? Moreover, what of Christendom itself? How much of that which
   bears the name of Christ is truly Christian? What proportion of those
   who term themselves the children of God, are really entitled to that
   name? More than half of professing Christendom is found within the
   pales of the Greek and Roman Catholic Churches! And what of
   Protestantism itself? What of the evangelical churches filled with
   their worldly, pleasure-loving, theater-going, Sabbath-desecrating,
   prayer-meeting-neglecting members? No; my reader, be not deceived with
   appearances or high-sounding phrases. God's flock is only a "little
   flock" (Luke 12:32). There is but a remnant according to the election
   of grace" (Rom. 11:5).

   Has the Gospel failed? Have God's purposes been defeated? Certainly
   not. The Gospel was never designed to convert the world. God never
   purposed to regenerate all humanity in this dispensation, any more than
   He did under the Mosaic Economy, when He suffered the nations to walk
   in their own ways. God's purpose for this Age is clearly defined in
   Acts 15:14--"Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the
   Gentiles, to take out of them a people for His name." In full harmony
   with this, the apostle Paul declared, "I am made all things to all men,
   that I might be all means save some"(1 Cor. 9:22). Clearly then, the
   Hope of the Church is not the Conversion of the World.

   Having dwelt at some length upon the general, let us now come to the
   particular--
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. Our Hope is not the Salvation of the Soul.

   In the New Testament the word "Salvation" has a threefold scope--past,
   present and future, which, respectively, has reference to our
   deliverance from the penalty, the power, and the presence of sin. When
   we say, above, that our Hope is not the Salvation of the soul, we mean
   that it is not our deliverance from the wrath to come which is the
   prospect God sets before His people. To certain of our readers it may
   appear almost a wearisome waste of time for us to discuss these points,
   but for the sake of the class for which this work is specially designed
   we would ask them to bear with us in patience. In these days when the
   Bible is so grievously neglected both in the pulpit and in the pew, we
   cannot afford to take anything for granted. Multitudes of those in our
   churches are ignorant of the most elementary truths of the Christian
   faith. Experience shows that comparatively few people are clear about
   even the A, B, C, of the Gospel. Talk to the average church-member, and
   only too often it will be found that he has nothing more than a vague
   and uncertain hope about his personal salvation. He is "trying to live
   up to the light that he has," he is "doing his best," and he hopes
   that, somehow, everything will come out right in the end. He does not
   dare to say I know I have passed from death unto life, but he hopes to
   go to Heaven at the last.

   Nowhere does Scripture present the Salvation of the soul as the
   believer's hope. Salvation from the guilt, the penalty, the wages, of
   sin is something for which believers thank God even now. Said our Lord
   to His disciples, "Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven"
   (Luke 10:20). The present-tense aspect of our salvation is presented in
   many Scriptures--"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My
   word and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and
   shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life"
   (John 5:24). How simple and definite this is! Eternal life is something
   which every believer in Christ already possesses, and for him there is
   no possibility of future condemnation in the sense of having to endure
   God's wrath. Again we read, "Beloved now are we the sons of God" (1
   John 3:2). We do not have to obey God's commandments, walk worthy, and
   serve the Lord, in order to become God's children, we are to do these
   things because we are, already, members of the household of faith. The
   salvation or redemption of our bodies is future, for it will not be
   until our Saviour's return that he "shall" change our vile body, that
   it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body" (Phil. 3:21). But the
   salvation of the soul, deliverance from the wrath to come, is an
   accomplished fact for every sinner, that has received the Lord Jesus
   Christ as his or her personal Saviour. All such have been "accepted in
   the Beloved" (Eph. 1:6). All such have been "made meet to be partakers
   of the inheritance of the saints in light" (Col. 1:12). all such have
   been "perfected for ever" (Heb. 10:14). So far as their standing before
   God is concerned.

   As another has said, "Salvation is not away off yonder at the gates of
   Heaven; salvation is at the cross. The grace of God that bringeth
   salvation hath appeared, and it brings salvation all the way down to
   where the sinner is--right there. You know our Lord's own picture of
   it. It is the illustration to which my mind recurs most instantly--that
   illustration of the good Samaritan. You know how beautifully that
   shadows out this blessed truth; that just as the good Samaritan went
   down the Jericho road and ministered to the wretch who lay there half
   dead, pouring oil into his wounds right there where he lay, just so the
   grace of God, that brings salvation, has come to the sinner in the
   place where he lies in his sins. No matter how great a sinner he may
   be, if he can be persuaded to turn the eye of faith toward the cross,
   there salvation comes" (Dr. C. I. Scofield). Again--

  3. Our Hope is not Death.

   Of all the extravagant and absurd interpretations of Scripture which
   have found a place among sober expositors is the belief that Death is
   the Hope which God has set before the believer. How it ever came to
   find acceptance it is difficult to say. It is true that there are a
   number of passages which speak of the Lord returning suddenly and
   unexpectedly, but to make the words "At such an hour as ye think not
   the Son of man cometh" and "Behold I come as a thief in the night" mean
   that death may steal in upon the believer without warning is to reduce
   the Word of God to meaningless jargon and is to make sane exposition
   impossible. Scripture says what it means, and means what it says. True
   there are Parables in the Bible; true there are some passages which are
   highly symbolical; but where this is the case the context usually gives
   clear intimation to that effect, and where it does not, the plain and
   literal force should always be given to the language of Holy Writ. In
   Scripture "death" means death, and the coming again of the Son of man
   means His coming, and the two expressions are not synonymous. As we
   have said, the Return of Christ and death (sometimes) each, alike, come
   suddenly and unexpectedly, but there all analogy between them ends.

   It is passing strange that Bible teachers should have confounded Death
   with the Second Coming of Christ. The former is spoken of as an "Enemy"
   (1 Cor. 15:26), whereas the latter is termed "that blessed hope" (Titus
   2:13), and surely these two terms cannot refer to the same thing. At
   the Return of our Lord we shall be made like Him (1 John 3:2), but
   believers are not made like Him at death, for death introduces them
   into a disembodied state. That "death" is not the believer's Hope is
   clear from many Scriptures. In 1 Pet. 1:3 the apostle returns thanks
   because we have been begotten again "unto a living hope." The saint of
   God has a living hope in a dying scene: a glorious prospect beyond this
   vale of tears. In 2 Tim. 4:8 the apostle Paul reminds us that there is
   laid up a crown of righteousness unto all them that love Christ's
   "appearing," which is further proof that death is not the Second Coming
   of Christ, for who is there that "loves" death? Death is my going to
   Christ, but His Return is Christ coming to me. Death is a cause of
   sadness and sorrow, but the Return of the Lord is a cause of joy and
   comfort--"Wherefore comfort one another with these words" (1 Thess.
   4:18, see context). Death lays the body in the dust, but at the Return
   of our Redeemer His people arise from the dust--"the dead in Christ
   shall rise first" (1 Thess. 4:17). Death is the "wages of sin," which
   means that death is the penalty of sin, but so completely has that
   penalty been borne by our Saviour that we read, "So Christ was once
   offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall
   He appear the second time without sin unto salvation" (Heb. 9:28).
   Death was certainly not the hope of the early Christians as is clear
   from 1 Thess. 1:9, 10 where we read, "Ye turned to God from idols to
   serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven" -
   these Thessalonian saints were looking for Christ not death. Finally;
   death cannot be our Hope, for death will not be the portion of all
   believers as is clear from the language of 1 Cor. 15:51, "We shall not
   all sleep." What then is our Hope? We answer--
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. Our Hope is the personal Return of our Redeemer.

   "Jesus Christ our hope" (1 Tim. 1:1). Jesus Christ is the believer's
   "all in all" (Col. 3:11). He is "our peace" (Eph. 2:14). He is "our
   life" (Col. 3:14). He is "made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
   sanctification, and redemption" (1 Cor. 1:30). And, we repeat, He is
   "our Hope." But hope always looks forward. Hope has to do with the
   future. "We are saved in hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
   what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we
   see not, then do we with patience wait for it" (Rom. 8:24, 25). This
   means that what we hope for is that which we do not yet posses. [3] As
   another has said, "Man was not made for the present, and the present
   was not intended to satisfy man. ** It is for the future, not the
   present, that man exists" (W. Trotter).

   The Hope of the believer is clearly set forth in Titus 2:13--"Looking
   for that blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and
   our Saviour Jesus Christ" (R. V.). Our Hope is the personal Return of
   Christ when He shall come back again to receive us unto Himself. Our
   Hope is to be taken out of this scene of sin and suffering and sorrow
   to be where Christ is(John 14:1-3). Our Hope is to be caught up to meet
   the Lord in the air and be for ever "with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:16,
   17). Our Hope is to be "made like" Him, and this hope will be realized
   when "we shall see Him as He is" (1 John 3:2). This is the "one hope"
   of our calling" (Eph. 4:4). This is the only Hope for everything else
   has failed.

   The hope of Philosophy has failed. Philosophy was the beau-ideal of the
   ancients. When Greece and Rome were the leading nations of the earth,
   the goal of every ambitious young man's desire was to become a
   philosopher. Philosophers were respected and honored by all. Philosophy
   set out to solve the "riddle of the universe" and to explain the
   rationale of all creation. It was expected that philosophy would find a
   solution to every problem and devise a remedy for every ill. But what
   were its fruits? "The world by wisdom knew not God" (1 Cor. 1:21). When
   the apostle Paul came to Athens--one of the principal centers of
   philosophic culture--he found an altar erected to "The Unknown God"
   (Acts 17:23). The only place the word "philosophy" is found in the
   Scriptures is in Col. 2:8, where we read "Beware lest any man spoil you
   through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after
   the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." Philosophy proved a
   willo'-the-wisp. Never was philosophy so thoroughly systematized and so
   ably expounded as it was in the days of Socrates, and never was society
   more corrupt. The ruins of ancient Greece bear witness to the failure
   and inadequacy of philosophy.

   The hope of Legislation has failed. It was the dream of the celebrated
   Plato that he could establish an ideal Republic by compiling and
   enforcing a perfect code of laws. But a perfect Code of Law was
   compiled a thousand years before Plato was born. God Himself gave to
   Israel a Code of Law on Mount Sinai--with what results? No sooner was
   that Law given than it was broken. The children of Israel declared,
   "All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient" (Ex. 24:7),
   but their words were an empty boast. The truth is that imperfect
   creatures cannot keep a perfect law, nor can imperfect men be induced
   to administer and enforce it. There is not a land in all the world
   where all the statutes of the State, or nearly all, are rigidly
   enforced. What then is the use of electing worthy and able legislators
   and for them to enact righteous laws if their successors refuse to
   enforce them? The present universal failure to do this testifies to the
   impotency of Law while it is left in human hands.

   The hope of human Government has failed. The Roman Empire experimented
   for many centuries and tried no less than seven different forms of
   government, but each in turn failed to accomplish the desired effects,
   and the last state of that Empire was worse than the first. Everything
   from absolute monarchy to absolute Socialism has already been weighed
   in the balances and found wanting. Revolting at tyrannical yokes
   imposed upon their subjects by the European rulers, our forefathers in
   this country sought to establish a free Republic, a democratic form of
   government, a government managed by the people and for the people. What
   have been its fruits? Are economic conditions in the United States
   better than those in England or Italy? Are relations between Capital
   and Labour more amicable and satisfactory? Is there less political
   corruption in high places, and fairer representation of the oppressed?
   Is there more contentment and satisfaction among the masses? We fear
   not. When we witness the methods employed in the average political
   campaign, when we read through the reports of the police courts, when
   we behold the strikes and lock-outs in every part of the country, when
   we peer beneath the surface and gaze upon the moral state of the
   masses, and when we hear the angry cries of the poor laborer and his
   half-starved family, we discover that the only hope for America as well
   as Europe is that our Lord shall come back again and take the
   government upon His shoulder.

   The hope of Civilization has failed. How much all of us have heard of
   "the march and progress of Civilization" during the past two
   generations! What an Utopia it was going to create! The masses were to
   be educated and reformed, injustices were to cease, war was to be
   abolished, and all mankind welded into one great Brotherhood living
   together in peace and good will. Civilization was to be the agency for
   ushering in the long-looked-for Millennium. Any one who dared to
   challenge the claims made on behalf of the enlightenment of our
   twentieth century, or called into question the transformation which the
   upward march of Civilization was supposed to be effecting, was regarded
   as an "old fogey" who was not abreast of the times, or, as a
   "pessimist" whose vision was blinded by prejudice. Was not "Evolution"
   an established fact of science and did not the fundamental principle of
   Evolution--progress and advancement from the lower to the higher--apply
   to nations and the human race as a whole, if so, we should soon
   discover that we had outgrown all the barbarities of the past. War was
   now no longer to be thought of, for those cultured nations within the
   magic pale of civilization would henceforth settle their differences
   amicably by means of arbitration. It was true that the great Powers
   continued building enormous armies and navies, but these, we were told,
   would merely be used to enforce Peace. But oh! what a madman's dream it
   has all proven. The Hope of Civilization, like every other hope which
   has not been founded upon the sure and certain Word of God, has also
   proved to be nothing more than an entrancing mirage, a tragic delusion.
   The great World War, with all its unmentionable horrors, its
   inhumanities, its barbaric ruthlessness, has rudely wakened a lethargic
   humanity to the utter insufficiency of all merely human expediencies,
   and has demonstrated as clearly as anything has ever been demonstrated
   that "Civilization" is nothing more than a high-sounding but empty
   title.

   We repeat again, the ONLY hope of the Church is the personal Return of
   the Redeemer to remove His people from these scenes of misery and
   bloodshed to be for ever with Himself; and the ONLY hope for this poor
   sin-cursed and Satan-dominated world is the Second Advent of the Son of
   Man to rule and reign over the earth in righteousness and peace. This
   is the world's LAST hope, for every other hope has failed it! We turn
   now to consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] In Scripture, "hope" is something more than desire or longing: it
   is a joyous expectation, a definite assurance. Faith is that which lays
   hold of God's promises; hope is that spiritual grace which sustains the
   heart until the promise is "received."
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

II. THE AUTHORIZATION OF OUR HOPE.

   The insufficiency and failure of the various hopes of the world
   reviewed above, serve only to furnish a background upon which, by way
   of contrast, may shine forth more prominently and gloriously the
   certainty and sufficiency of our hope. Every hope of man which
   originates in his own mind and heart is doomed to end in
   disappointment. If men refuse the light which is furnished by Divine
   revelation then they must expect to remain in darkness, and, as our
   Lord said, "If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how
   great is that darkness!" (Matt. 6:23). The value of a hope lies in the
   authorization of it, what then are the grounds for our hope?

   What warrant have we for expecting the Return of the Redeemer? After
   all that has been said in the previous pages and in view of the various
   Scriptures therein cited, a lengthy reply to this question is not
   necessary. In brief, it may be said, the inspired and infallible Word
   of Him who cannot lie is our warrant and authorization for looking for
   that Blessed Hope. But, briefly, to particularize.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. We have the Promise of the Lord Jesus Himself.

   We have already quoted from John 14 in other connections but we now
   refer to it again. On the eve of His crucifixion our Saviour turned to
   His disciples and said, "I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go
   and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto
   Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also" (John 14:2, 3). Here is
   an assertion about which there is no ambiguity whatever. Here is a
   promise that is positive and unequivocal. Here is a word of comfort
   from the lips of Truth incarnate. The Lord who has gone away from this
   earth to prepare a place for His people is coming back again for them,
   coming back in person, coming to receive them to Himself that they may
   be with Him for evermore.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. We have the word of God's messengers at the time of His Son's Ascension.

   These words are recorded in the first chapter of the Acts which
   presents a scene of unusual interest and importance. Our Lord's sojourn
   upon earth was now to terminate. The time of His departure was at hand.
   The great purpose of the Divine incarnation had been accomplished. The
   cross and the empty sepulcher lay behind, and now the Saviour of
   sinners was to be exalted to the right hand of the Majesty on high.
   Together with a few of His disciples He went as far as Bethany, and
   lifting up His hands He blessed them, and while in the act of blessing
   them He was "parted from them, and went up into heaven" (Luke 24:50,
   51). And a cloud received Him out of their sight, and then we are told,
   "While they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, two men
   stood by them in white apparel: which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why
   stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from
   you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go
   into heaven" (Acts 1:10, 11). Here again is a statement that is clear
   and simple. Here again is a promise that is plain and positive. The
   Lord Jesus has gone up into heaven, but He is not to remain there for
   ever. The "same Jesus" which ascended is to descend: the "same Jesus"
   which was seen returning to this earth. The absent One is coming back,
   coming back in person in "like manner" as He went away.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. We have the inspired testimony of the apostles.

   We have already shown in a previous chapter that each of the apostles
   bore witness to the Second Coming of Christ. Their testimony is clear,
   full, and uniform. At this point we shall select but a single passage,
   a familiar one, from the epistles of the apostle Paul. In 1 Thess.
   4:13-18 we read, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,
   concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others
   which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
   even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For
   this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive
   and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent (i.e., "go
   before" them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from
   heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the
   trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which
   are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
   clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
   Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words."

   The above passage is the most comprehensive statement upon the
   Redeemer's Return which is to be found in the apostolic writings. The
   importance of the communication contained therein is intimated by the
   prefatory clause--"This we say unto you by the word of the Lord," an
   expression which is always reserved for those passages of Divine
   revelation which are of peculiar importance or solemnity. Here again we
   learn that Christ is going to return in person--"The Lord Himself."
   Here again we have a positive promise--"The Lord Himself shall
   descend." And here again, the Second Coming of Christ is presented as
   the "blessed hope" of the Church--"comfort one another with these
   words." We reserve further comment upon this passage for a later
   chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. Finally, we have the Promise of the Lord given from the Throne.

   We have previously pointed out that, some fifty or sixty years after
   His ascension to the right hand of God, Christ sent His angel to the
   beloved John on the Isle of Patmos saying, "Surely I come quickly" Rev.
   22:20). This was our Lord's last promise to His people, as though to
   intimate that He would have them continually occupied with His imminent
   Return. Perhaps this will be the best place to meet an objection that
   is frequently made by those who seek to find flaws in the Word of God.
   It is said that the Lord Jesus here made a mistake. He declared that He
   was coming quickly and more than eighteen centuries have passed since
   then and yet He has not returned!

   The explanation of this supposed difficulty is very simple. When the
   Lord Jesus said, "Surely I come quickly," He spoke from Heaven, and
   Heaven's measurement of time is very different from earth's. Never once
   while He was here upon earth did the Saviour say or even hint that He
   would return "quickly." On the contrary He gave plain intimation that
   after His departure a lengthy interval would have to pass ere He came
   back again. In the Parable of the Nobleman He spoke of Himself as One
   taking a journey into "a far country" (Luke 19:12). On another occasion
   He represented an evil servant saying, during the time of His absence,
   "My Lord delayeth His coming" (Matt. 24:28). While in the Parable of
   the Talents He openly declared that "After a long time the Lord of
   those servants cometh and reckoneth with them" (Matt. 25:19). What we
   would here press upon the attention of our readers is, that, each of
   these utterances were made by our Lord during the time when He was
   still upon earth and therefore they must be considered from earth's
   viewpoint; but when the Lord Jesus said "Surely I come quickly" He
   spoke from Heaven and concerning Heaven's measurement of time we need
   to bear in mind that word "Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing,
   that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
   as one day" (2 Pet. 3:8). In the light of the last quoted Scripture it
   is easy to understand Rev. 22:20--if our Lord returns before the
   present century terminates He will have been away but two days!

   "Surely I come quickly." These are the words of our ascended Lord. This
   is His promise, sent from the very Throne of Heaven. This is His final
   word to His people before they hear his "shout" calling them to be with
   Himself. This, then, is the warrant, the ground, the authorization of
   our Hope. Let us now consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

III. THE BLESSEDNESS OF OUR HOPE.

   It is both interesting and profitable to notice the several adjectives
   which are used in connection with the believer's Hope. In 2 Thess. 2:16
   it is termed a "good hope." In Heb. 6:19 it is described as a hope
   "both sure and steadfast." In 1 Pet. 1:3 it is denominated "a living
   hope." In Eph. 4:4 it is styled the "one hope" of our calling. While in
   Titus 2:13 it is spoken of as blessed hope." The blessedness of our
   Hope is that which is now particularly to engage our attention. In what
   respects is our hope a "blessed" one? We answer--
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. Because of its bearing upon Israel.

   Israel's future blessings wait for the Return of their Messiah. When He
   was here before He was despised and rejected by His brethren according
   to the flesh, but when He comes back again to this earth they shall
   welcome and worship Him. That prophecy of Zechariah's which received a
   partial fulfillment when He was here before, is yet to receive a
   further and complete fulfillment, in the days of His Second Advent.
   This is clear from the words which immediately follow these which had
   reference to His entry into Jerusalem a few days before His
   crucifixion--"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
   Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is just, and having
   salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of
   an ass. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from
   Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and He shall speak
   peace unto the heathen: and His dominion shall be from sea even to sea,
   and from the river even to the ends of the earth" (Zech. 9:9, 10). And
   note further the closing verses of the same chapter--"And the Lord
   their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for
   they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon His
   land. For how great is His goodness, and how great is His beauty! corn
   shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids" (vss. 16,
   17). The real "Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem" is yet future. Our Lord
   is to enter the royal city again and at the time of His return He shall
   enter it as King in fact and in full manifestation of that fact. Then
   it is that Zion's King shall come to her "having salvation," and then
   it is that Israel shall marvel at His grace and at His excellency; and
   then it will be that the daughter of Jerusalem shall be exalted and be
   once more owned and blessed by Jehovah. It is on the return of Christ
   to this earth that Israel shall enter into the enjoyment of that
   inheritance which was given unto their fathers, and under the reign of
   their Messiah shall become a blessing to all nations. Again; the
   Redeemer's Return is a blessed Hope.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. Because of its bearing upon the Gentiles.

   This aspect of our subject has not received the attention which it
   deserves. It has been assumed by some that the present dispensation is
   the time when God is blessing the Gentiles and that in the Millennium
   the Jews will be the special objects of God's favor. It is true that in
   the Millennium Israel shall enter into the enjoyment of their
   inheritance and that at that time they shall occupy the chief position,
   governmentally, among the nations, but it is a mistake to suppose that
   the Gentiles will receive less notice from God then than they do now.
   During this Age God is merely taking out of the Gentiles a people for
   His name, and hence it is that the vast majority of them are still
   living amid the darkness of heathendom. But it will not always be thus.
   The restoration of Israel to God's favor will result in wide blessing
   to the Gentiles.

   In the eleventh chapter of Romans, where the apostle is showing that
   Israel's present "blindness" is not to continue forever, he declares,
   "I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but
   rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to
   provoke them to jealousy. Now if the fall of them (Israel) be the
   riches of the world (i.e., the enrichment of the Gentiles by the
   Gospel), and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how
   much more their fullness? (that is, How much more will Israel's
   latter-day blessing enrich the Gentiles). For if the casting away of
   them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them
   be, but life from the dead?" (vss. 11, 12, 15). How clear it is from
   these verses that, universal blessings for mankind are not to be
   brought about by the indefinite prolongation of this present
   dispensation and the preaching of the Gospel, but by the restoration of
   Israel, after Christendom has been cut off for its non-continuance in
   God's goodness. As another has said, "The end of apostate Judaism was
   judgment: the end of apostate Gentile Christianity will be judgment
   also. But just as blessing came to us when judgment fell upon the Jew,
   so when judgment falls upon Christendom, blessing will be restored to
   Israel, and Israel's restoration will bring still fuller blessing to
   the world than any it has had during the present dispensation; it will
   be as "life from the dead!" (W. Trotter).

   The words of Simeon recorded in Acts 15 are in perfect agreement with
   the teaching of Romans 11--"Simeon hath declared how God at the first
   did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. And
   to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, after this,
   I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David (i. e.,
   Israel), which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins
   thereof, and I will set it up; that the residue of men might seek after
   the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom My name is called, saith the
   Lord, who doeth all these things" (vss. 14-17). It is to be noted that
   here again the "seeking of the Lord" by the "residue of men and all the
   Gentiles" is subsequent to the restoration of Israel.

   There are many prophecies in the Old Testament which speak of the
   Millennial blessedness of the Gentiles. We single out one or two
   without commenting extensively upon them. "And the glory of the Lord
   shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth
   of the Lord hath spoken it" (Is. 40:5). "O sing unto the Lord a new
   song; for He hath done marvelous things: His right hand, and His holy
   arm, hath gotten Him the victory. The Lord hath made known His
   salvation: His righteousness hath He openly shewed in the sight of the
   heathen. He hath remembered His mercy and His truth toward the house of
   Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God"
   (Ps. 98:1-3). Once more the order is the same: God's righteousness is
   displayed before the "heathen" and His salvation is made known to the
   ends of the earth following God's dealing in mercy with Israel.

   One more quotation must suffice: "And ye shall know that I am in the
   midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else: and My
   people shall never be ashamed. And it shall come to pass afterward,
   that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh"(Joel 2:27, 28). Like all
   prophecy, this one receives a double fulfillment. It is to be observed
   that when Peter quoted from Joel on the Day of Pentecost he did not
   say, "And now is fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet Joel"
   (Acts 2:16), because the words of Joel quoted above will not be filled
   until the Millennium, then and not till then, will God's Spirit be
   poured out upon "all flesh"--for that glad day, the earth waits the
   Second Advent of our Lord. Thus we see that the Return of Christ to
   this earth to usher in the Millennium will be attended with gracious
   and wide blessing to the Gentiles, for then it will be that "The earth
   shall be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters
   cover the sea" (Is. 11:9). Again, the Return of the Redeemer is a
   Blessed Hope.

  3.Because of its bearing upon the Church.

   Concerning this point we shall here merely generalize, for this
   precious aspect of our subject will come up for consideration again in
   a later chapter. In a word, we may say that, the Hope of the Church
   lies in the future and not in the present, is heavenly and not earthly.
   To His disciples our Lord said, "In the world ye shall have
   tribulation" (John 16:30). This is the present portion of the Church
   which is His body: this is all that the believer is to expect from the
   world in which he is now living. We are not to be surprised if the
   world "hates" us, because it first hated our Divine Master. Said the
   apostle "Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
   believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake." Yea, we are assured
   that "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution." The Lord's path to the Throne was via the Cross, and we
   are called to "follow His steps." The Hope of the Church then lies not
   in this world, but above it; not in the present, but in the future.

   At first sight it may appear strange, especially to unbelievers, that
   the Christian should speak of his hope. In contrast to the wicked who
   have "no peace," the saint has a satisfying portion. The believer has
   already drunk of that "living water" of which those who drink shall
   "never thirst." The believer is already in possession of "eternal
   life," but he has not yet entered into the full and unhindered
   enjoyment of it--that is still before him as the object of his hope. In
   one sense then, the Christian is satisfied, in another sense he is not.
   The believer already knows One, yea, is now indwelt by One who can
   satisfy him. He knows Christ, possesses Christ, enjoys Christ; but, as
   yet, he has not seen Christ. It is by faith (not feelings) that we know
   and enjoy Christ, but the more we know and enjoy Him thus, the more we
   long to behold Him--"Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now
   ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
   of glory; receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
   souls" (1 Pet. 1:8, 9).

   "Yes, my brethren, believing in Christ, whom we have not seen, we love
   Him; we rejoice in Him with unspeakable joy; we receive the salvation
   of our soul. But to see Christ--to have the salvation which He wrought
   out on the cross applied to our bodies as well as to our soul--to have
   it perfected in our experience even as it respects our soul--to have it
   consummated thus in all who are follow-partakers with us of Christ--to
   be with Him, and with them, in our Father's house--to behold His glory
   which the Father has given Him--to appear with Him in glory when He
   appears--to reign with Him over a ransomed and redeemed and happy
   creation--to fulfill our part in the universal harmony of all in heaven
   and all in earth, when all shall bow the knee to Jesus, when every
   tongue shall own Him Lord, and all voices shall join to celebrate His
   praise,--this, and far more than this--far more than heart can conceive
   or tongue explain, is what we wait for; and, above all, we wait for Him
   whose return shall introduce us to all this perfect blessedness--we
   wait for God's Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even
   Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come. HE IS OUR HOPE. We
   know Him now by faith as our Saviour, our Lord, our life, our peace,
   our joy, our all. AND HE IS OUR HOPE. He is plainly said to be so in 1
   Tim. 1:1--"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God
   our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ OUR HOPE." And what He is thus in so
   many plain words expressly declared to be in this passage, He is shown
   to be by the uniform, unvarying testimony of Gospels, Acts, Epistles,
   and Revelation ("Plain Papers on Prophetic Subjects" by W. Trotter [4]
   ). Again, the Redeemer's Return is a "Blessed Hope"--

  4. Because of its bearing upon Christ Himself.

   Our Lord Himself is waiting that blest moment when He shall rise from
   the Father's Throne, descend to the air and catch up His loved and
   redeemed ones to be for ever with Himself. What other meaning can
   possibly be given to that remarkable word recorded in Rev. 1:9--"I
   John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in
   the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ." And again we read, "But this
   Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on
   the right hand of God. From henceforth expecting till His enemies be
   made His footstool" (Heb. 10:12, 13). Yes, for well nigh two thousand
   years, our Lord has patiently waited for the last predestined member to
   be added to the Church which is His body. Nay, may we not go further,
   and reverently say, from all eternity the Lord Jesus has been waiting
   to possess that people given to Him by the Father before the foundation
   of the world! It was for this "joy" that was set before Him that He
   despised the cross and endured its shame (Heb. 12:2). It was for this
   "one pearl" which He esteemed of "great price"--oh! wondrous
   thought--that He went and sold all that He had to buy it (Matt. 13:46).
   It is for this blood-purchased people that He has been interceding on
   high since the day of His ascension. And at His Second Advent the time
   of waiting, the long interval of His "patience," will be ended. Then it
   will be that He shall come to receive us unto Himself. Then it will be
   that He shall present the Church to Himself "a glorious church, not
   having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy
   and without blemish" (Eph. 5:27). Then it will be that "He shall see of
   the travail of His soul and be satisfied"(Is. 53:11). O blessed Hope.
   Well may we cry "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." For Him, too, as well as
   for us, this is "that blessed hope."

   And now, dear reader, What is your hope? What is it that is occupying
   your heart and filling your vision? Is it the prospect of a speedily
   returning Redeemer? If you are truly the Lord's then do you not yearn
   to see Him face to face? Do you not long to fall at His feet and say
   "my Lord and my God"? Surely you do, for you cannot be fully satisfied
   in this world. How could you be? How can you find satisfaction in a
   world from which your Saviour is absent? "Earth is a wilderness, not
   merely (no, nor chiefly) because of its trials and its hardships, its
   sorrows and its pangs, its disappointments and reverses, but because He
   is not here. Heaven would not be heaven to the saint if Jesus were not
   there. He, His presence (as that which introduces us to it), His coming
   is our hope--the hope of the Christian, the hope of the Church. May our
   hearts cherish it as we have never done! May its brightness so attract
   us that earth's fairest, loveliest, most enchanting scenes may be
   weariness itself to our hearts, as detaining us from the object of our
   hopes! May that object so animate us that earth's heaviest
   afflictions--the narrowest, most rugged, and most thorny portions of
   the narrow way--may be welcome to us, as the path that leads us onwards
   to the goal of our expectations the home of our heart, the Jesus whose
   presence makes it what it is, whose love made Him tread a narrower and
   a darker path than this, and whose smile of ineffable satisfaction
   shall crown the faith that has trusted Him, the love that has followed
   Him, and the patience of hope which has waited for Him, throughout this
   dreary journey, along this narrow way, amid the darkness and solitude
   of this long and dismal night" (W. Trotter).

                                 Chapter Three

                       The Fact of the Redeemer's Return

   It has been pointed out by another that the New Testament is concerned
   mainly with the presentation of three great facts: first, that the Son
   of God has been to the earth but has gone away; second, that the Holy
   Spirit has come down to this earth and is still here; third, that the
   Son of God is coming back again to this earth. To quote--"These are the
   three great subjects unfolded in the New Testament Scriptures; and we
   shall find that each of them has a double bearing: it has a bearing
   upon the world, and a bearing upon the church; upon the world as a
   whole, and upon each unconverted man, woman, and child in particular;
   upon the church as a whole, and upon each individual member thereof, in
   particular. It is impossible for any one to avoid the bearing of these
   three grand facts upon his own personal condition and future destiny"
   ("Papers on the Lord's Coming" by C. H. M. [5] ). A few words now on
   each of these facts.

   First; the Son of God has been to this earth but has gone away. Here is
   a fact marvelous in its nature and far-reaching in its effects. This
   world has been visited by its Creator. The very feet of the Lord of
   Glory have trod this earth on which we now dwell. From heaven's throne
   there descended the Only-begotten of the Father, and for upwards of
   thirty years He tabernacled here among men. His appearing was not
   attended with regal pomp and outward splendor. His glory was veiled and
   His Divine prerogatives were laid aside. He who was in the form of God
   took upon Himself the form of a servant. He who thought it not robbery
   to be equal with God, was made in the likeness of men. He who had
   received the worship of angels was born in a manger. What an infinite
   stoop! What amazing condescension! What matchless grace! Were it not
   that we have grown so familiar with the recital of these things, were
   it not that our cold hearts had lost their sense of wonderment, we
   should be overwhelmed with adoring gratitude. Were it not that we were
   so occupied with the things of this world and our own interests we
   should prostrate ourselves before God in worship and cry, "Worthy is
   the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
   strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing"(Rev. 5:12). Here then is
   the first great fact presented in the New Testament--the Son of God
   came down to this earth.

   How was He received? What welcome did He meet with? What effect did the
   coming of the "Mighty God" (Is. 1:6) have upon the world? What effect
   would we suppose it to have had? Should we expect to learn that the
   birth of the God-man was hailed as the most wondrous and blessed event
   in all history? Should we expect to find the rulers of the earth
   casting their scepters at His feet? Should we expect to find Him an
   Object of universal worship? Such expectations would but betray our
   ignorance of the depths of human depravity. Of sinners it is written
   "They did not like to retain God in their knowledge" (Rom. 1:28). And
   why? Because "the carnal mind is enmity against God" (Rom. 8:7).--such
   it was demonstrated to be when God was manifested in the flesh. "There
   was no room for them in the inn" (Luke 2:7) sums up the whole tragic
   story. The Christ of God was not wanted. His ineffable holiness
   condemned the vile wickedness of sinners. He came here to "heal the
   broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering
   of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised," but
   the world hated Him, "hated" Him "without a cause"(John 15:25). Men
   said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill Him" (Mark 12:7), and no
   ordinary death would suffice and appease the hatred of their wicked
   hearts. He must die the death of a criminal, He must be crucified- a
   form of punishment reserved for slaves who were guilty of the vilest
   crimes (Josephus). By wicked hands He was "crucified and slain" (Acts
   2:20).

   "Where sin abounded grace did much more abound" (Rom. 5:20). Marvelous
   are the ways of God. He maketh, even the "wrath of man" to praise Him
   (Ps. 76:10). Those wicked hands of men which nailed to the Cross the
   Lord of Glory, were but fulfilling, unknown to themselves, the eternal
   purposes of Jehovah. The Lord Jesus as "delivered by the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God" (Acts 2:23). These words bring before
   us the Divine side of that mysterious transaction. As He hung there on
   the Cross the Lord Jesus suffered not only at the hands of man, but He
   was also smitten by the hand of God (Is. 53:4, 10) because it was then
   and there that He "bare our sins in His own body on the tree" (1 Pet.
   2:24). On the Cross, our blessed Saviour who knew no sin was "made sin
   for us" (2 Cor. 5:21). It was because He hung there as the Sin-Bearer
   that Jehovah said, "Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, and against
   the man that is My Fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the Shepherd,
   and the sheep shall be scattered" (Zech. 13:7). Thus, the Death of
   Christ must be viewed from two great standpoints. From the side of the
   world His death was a deliberate, cold-blooded murder; from the side of
   God it was a satisfaction rendered unto His justice and holiness which
   had been outraged by sin. From the side of the world, the Cross was the
   climatic display of its sin and guilt; from the Divine side it was
   God's provision to remove the sin and guilt of all who believe. From
   man's side, the world has yet to account to God for the death of His
   Son. Therefore it is that God has a "controversy" with the nations. My
   reader, you are living in a world over which hangs the judgment of God!
   And the day of His vengeance draws near. God has yet to reckon with a
   world that is stained with the blood of His beloved Son and soon will
   His fearful wrath be poured out upon it. How rarely, in these days, is
   this side of the Cross pressed upon men's consciences and hearts. The
   Death of the Lamb of God secured our salvation, but it consummated the
   world's guilt.

   Christ is absent. Why? Because the world rejected Him. Yet, if the
   world disowned Him, the heavens received Him. If men despised Him, God
   hath highly exalted Him, and given Him the name which is above every
   name. We shall consider now, though, more briefly, the second great
   fact.

   God the Holy Spirit has come down to this earth and is still here.
   This, also, is an amazing and stupendous fact. God did not abandon the
   world to which in love He sent His Son, even though that love was
   requited by the crucifixion of the Holy One. How strictly just it would
   have been had God then and there entirely deserted this rebellious race
   of ours! He "spared not" the angels that sinned but "cast them down to
   hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto
   judgment" (2 Pet. 2:4), why then should He continue to deal in mercy
   with a race that had committed a crime which far surpassed in
   wickedness any sin of which the angels could have been guilty? Ah!
   God's ways are "past finding out." Where sin abounded grace did much
   more abound. The day of God's wrath was postponed. A world guilty of
   murdering God's beloved Son was granted a reprieve. In marvelous
   long-sufferance God gave the world an opportunity, a protracted
   opportunity, to repent and thus reap the benefits of the Death Divine.

   The Holy Spirit has come down to this earth. Here is an amazing fact of
   stupendous magnitude. There is a Divine person on earth to-day. He has
   been here, now, for eighteen centuries unseen, unknown, and
   unappreciated by the world, yet here, nevertheless. Like the absence of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, the presence of the Holy Spirit has a double
   bearing--a bearing upon the world, and a bearing upon the Church. His
   relation to the world is a solemn and an awful one. The Holy Spirit is
   here to convict the world of its terrible crime in rejecting and
   crucifying the Son of God. This is clear from the language of John
   16--"When He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of
   righteousness, and of judgment. Of sin, because they believe not on Me.
   Of righteousness because I go to My Father, and ye see Me no more; Of
   judgment because the prince of this world is judge" (vss. 8-11). These
   verses do not refer to the work of the Holy Spirit in individual
   sinners, but speak of the consequences of His presence on earth toward
   the world. It is true that by His gracious operations the Holy Spirit
   brings sinners to repentance, but this is not the subject of the above
   verses: there, as we have said, we have set forth the relation of the
   Holy Spirit toward the "world" in general. The above quotation brings
   before us the significance of the Spirit's presence on earth rather
   than defines the character of His work. In the sense that He is now
   here, the Holy Spirit would not be present at all if the Lord Jesus had
   not been cast out by the world. The Holy Spirit is here to fill the
   place of an absent Christ. The presence of the Holy Spirit is the
   demonstration of the fact that Christ is absent. Therefore it is that
   His presence here "reproves the world," reproves the world "of the
   cause of Christ's absence, reproves the "world" of its awful crime in
   putting to death the Lord of Glory. He reproves the world of "sin."
   Furthermore; the presence here of the Holy Spirit reproves the world of
   "righteousness," of righteousness because Christ has gone to the Father
   and the world sees Him no more, nor will it see Him until He returns in
   judgment. The "righteousness" of which the Spirit reproves or convicts
   the world is the righteousness of God the Father in His exaltation to
   His own right hand of the One cast out by the world. Finally, the
   presence here of the Holy Spirit convicts the world of "judgment"
   because Satan, the prince of this world, is already judged, though the
   sentence has not yet been executed. So much then for the world-ward
   bearing of the fact of the Holy Spirit's presence on earth.

   Like the fact of our Lord's rejection by the world, the presence of the
   Holy Spirit on earth also has a bearing upon the Church--a blessed
   bearing. God has overruled the issues of this second great fact. Though
   the presence here of the Holy Spirit condemns the world, it involves
   infinite blessing for the Church. Churchward, the Holy Spirit is here
   to take the place of our absent Saviour. He is here to "quicken" (John
   3:6) as Christ quickened (John 5:21). He is here to "teach" (John
   14:26) as Christ taught (Matt 7:29). He is here to "comfort" (John
   16:7) as Christ comforted (John 14:1). In short, the Holy Spirit is
   here to do for God's people what Christ would have done for them had He
   remained on the earth. The consequences, then, of the presence here of
   God the Holy Spirit are unspeakably solemn as regards the world, but
   infinitely precious as regards the saints.

   We are now prepared to consider the third great fact which is presented
   to our notice in the New Testament scriptures that fact which forms the
   subject of this chapter--the fact of the Redeemer's Return. And--
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. The Statement of this Fact.

   To state in the fewest possible words the broad fact itself--the Lord
   Jesus is coming back again. As we have seen, He has gone away form this
   world. He ascended on high. But heaven is not to retain Him for ever.
   Scripture declares that He is to vacate His Father's throne where He is
   now seated, that He will descend to the air and receive His people unto
   Himself, and, that subsequently, He will return to the earth to set up
   His Millennial Kingdom.

   The fact of our Lord's Return is set forth in the New Testament as
   clearly and as fully as either of the other two facts to which we have
   referred. The fact and truth of the second advent of Christ occupies a
   commanding position in the New Testament. In our Lord's tender farewell
   address to His disciples (John 14-16) the prospect and promise of His
   Return was the first subject to which He directed their attention (John
   14:1-3). After He had left His disciples, yea, while in the very act of
   ascending, He sent two of His angels to tell them "This same Jesus,
   which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as
   ye have seen Him go into heaven" (Acts 1:11). In the first Epistle
   which the apostle Paul was inspired to write, namely, the
   "Thessalonian," he referred in every chapter to the Redeemer's Return.
   In his instructions to the Corinthians concerning their celebration of
   the Lord's Supper, he wrote, "As often as ye eat this bread, and drink
   this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till He come" (1 Cor. 11:26). As
   we have already stated in another connection, the first promise that
   was given to fallen man was that the woman's Seed should come and
   bruise the Serpent's head--a prophecy which will not receive its
   fulfillment until the time of our Lord's Return. The last recorded
   words of our blessed Saviour, found in the closing chapter of the
   Bible, were, "Surely I come quickly" (Rev. 22:20). Thus we see that at
   the beginning and also at the end of the Sacred Volume, the Blessed
   Hope is given prominence, while between these two utterances of God
   Himself are literally hundreds of verses which bear directly upon this
   precious theme. The same Book which tells us that our Lord came to this
   earth and went away; the same Book which tells us that God the Spirit
   is now present on the earth, also declares that the Lord Jesus is
   coming back again, and, as another has said, "If we admit one fact we
   must admit all: if we deny one, we must deny all; inasmuch as all rest
   upon precisely the same authority. They stand or fall together."

   The fact of our Lord's Return is stated in the most positive, emphatic,
   and unequivocal language. "I will come again" (John 14:3). He did not
   say, "I may come again," or "I intend to come again," but "I will come
   again." Moved by the Holy Spirit the apostle Paul wrote "The Lord
   Himself shall descend from heaven" etc. (I Thess. 4:16). The apostle
   did not say "We shall go to the Lord," or "The Lord will send for us"
   but "The Lord Himself shall descent." The fact of our Lord's Return is
   not set forth in mysterious and obscure figures of speech, but is
   stated in language so plain and simple that he who runs may read and is
   expressed in terms of finality, beyond which there is no appeal. "For
   yet a little while and He that shall come will come, and will not
   tarry" (Heb. 10:37). And again, "Surely I come quickly" (Rev. 22:20).
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The Interpretation of this Fact.

   This third great fact which is presented to our notice in the New
   Testament must be interpreted on precisely the same lines and by the
   same canons as the other two Facts, i.e., the Scriptures which set
   forth the Second Advent of Christ must be received just as we receive
   those statements which tell us of His first advent and of the descent
   to earth of the Holy Spirit. Those verses which treat of the Redeemer's
   Return must be taken at their face value: they must be received by
   faith just as they read: they must be understood literally. We press
   this point upon our readers because there have been many teachers who
   have sought to spiritualize the Scriptural references to our Lord's
   second coming and who have treated them as though their language must
   be regarded as figurative and symbolical. Just as the Lord Jesus came
   to the earth the first time in person so will He come the second time.
   Our Redeemer is to return bodily and visibly. The language of Holy Writ
   gives as much reason for believing in a literal and personal return of
   Christ as it did for His First Advent. "Occupy till I come." "If I will
   that he tarry till I come." "Ye do shew the Lord's death till He come."
   "Ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; and to
   wait for His Son from heaven." These are representative passages, and
   no one reading them for the first time without theological bias would
   ever think that they meant anything else than a literal, personal
   Advent. And yet the plain language of the Word has been twisted and
   distorted and made to teach almost anything and everything other than
   its obvious signification. We shall not weary our readers by examining
   and refuting at length every forced and fanciful interpretation which
   has been indulged in by various commentators, such a task is
   unnecessary and would be unprofitable. Those theories which have gained
   the most adherents may be grouped into three classes.

   First; there is a class of commentators who regard the coming of the
   Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost as the fulfillment of Christ's
   promise to return. This view is based upon our Lord's Word in John 14
   where, after declaring to His disciples that He would give them
   "Another Comforter" who would abide with them forever," He immediately
   added, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" (vs. 18).
   But to regard the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost as the
   accomplishment of Christ's promise "I will come again" is to confuse
   the Persons of the Holy Trinity. A sufficient refutation of this error
   is found in the fact that the Epistles which were all of them written
   after Pentecost contain numerous references to and promises concerning
   the personal return of Christ.

   Second; another class of commentators regard the destruction of
   Jerusalem by the Roman armies in A. D. 70 as the fulfillment of our
   Lord's promise to come back to the earth and, untenable as this theory
   is, strange to say, it has met with a very wide acceptation among
   Christian theologians. This theory is based upon a careless exposition
   of Matt. 24. At the beginning of this chapter we learn that His
   disciples asked our Lord three questions: First, "Tell us, when shall
   these things be?" The "these things" look back to the previous verse
   where Christ had foretold the destruction of the temple. Second, "And
   what shall be the sign of Thy coming? Third, "And of the end of the
   age?" Now in order to understand our Lord's complete answer to these
   three questions it is necessary to pay close attention to the parallel
   passages found in Mark 13 and Luke 21. A careful comparison of these
   chapters will make plain the different answers which our Lord returned
   to His disciples' questions. In His answers He made a clear distinction
   between the destruction of Jerusalem and His subsequent personal
   return, though we must remember that as "history repeats itself" some
   of the signs which heralded the approach of each event were common to
   both. When speaking of the former He said, "When ye shall see Jerusalem
   compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh"
   (Luke 21:20); but when referring to the latter He declared, "And there
   shall be signs in the sun and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon
   the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves
   roaring; men's hearts failing them with fear, and for looking after
   those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven
   shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a
   cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come
   to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
   draweth nigh" (Luke 21:25-28) [6] (see footnote). That the destruction
   of Jerusalem did not exhaust the predictions made by our Lord with
   reference to His own return is evident from the fact that in the book
   of Revelation--written at least twenty years after the destruction of
   Jerusalem--He promises, no less than six times, to "come again."

   Third; another class of commentators regard the death of the believer
   as the fulfillment of our Lord's promise to come back again and receive
   His own unto Himself. This error has already been refuted in an earlier
   chapter so that nothing further needs now to be said concerning it.

   In Acts 3:18 we have enunciated a principle which supplies a sure and
   certain key to prophetic interpretation--"But those things, which God
   before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should
   suffer, He hath so fulfilled." The important words here are "so
   fulfilled." How had the Old Testament prophecies concerning the
   "sufferings" of Christ been "fulfilled?" The answer is literally. And,
   in like manner, will be accomplished those unfulfilled prophecies which
   speak of the coming "glory" of Christ. Just as those predictions which
   made it known that Christ should be sold for "thirty pieces of silver,"
   that His hands and His feet should be "pierced," that He should be
   given "vinegar, mingled with gall" to drink,--just as these were
   fulfilled to the letter, so the Scriptures which declare that he shall
   "descend from heaven with a shout," that "every eye shall see Him" when
   He comes back to earth, that He shall return in power and great glory
   and shall be accompanied by "ten thousands of His saints"--just so
   shall these predictions be fulfilled to the very letter.

  3. The twofold bearing of this Fact.

   We come now to a point concerning which it behooves believers,
   particularly young believers and beginners in the study of prophecy, to
   be quite clear upon. Like the other two great Facts which we have
   reviewed--the First Advent of our Lord to this earth and His going
   away, and the presence now of the Holy Spirit upon this earth--this
   third great fact of the Redeemer's Return also has a double bearing, a
   bearing upon the Church and a bearing upon the world. The Second Coming
   of Christ will occur in two stages. Just as a man living in New York
   might take a railroad journey to California, and while enroute break
   his journey at Chicago, so Christ will break His journey from heaven to
   earth. He is now in heaven; He will return to the earth. His ultimate
   destination is the Mount of Olives (Zech. 14:4), but He first breaks
   His journey in the air (1 Thess. 4:16). It is highly important to the
   understanding of unfulfilled prophecy that these two stages in the
   Return of Christ should be clearly distinguished, failure to do so will
   inevitably result in the utmost confusion. There are not yet to be two
   Returnings of Christ, but on Return in two stages.

   The two stages in the Return of Christ are clearly distinguished in the
   New Testament. We now call attention to some of the leading differences
   between them. 1. The first stage will be in grace, the second will be
   in judgment. 2. The first stage will reach no farther than the air, the
   second will reach to the earth itself. 3. The first stage is when the
   Redeemer returns to catch up the saints unto Himself, the second is
   when He returns to the earth to rule it with a rod of iron. 4. The
   first stage will be secret, unseen by the world, the second will be
   public and seen by every eye. 5. The first stage is Christ returning as
   "The Morning Star" (Rev. 22:16), the second is His appearing as "The
   Sun of Righteousness" (Mal. 4:2). 6. At the first stage he comes for
   His saints (John 14:3), at the second He returns with His saints (Jude
   1:14). 7. The first stage, His secret coming for His saints, is not the
   subject of a single Old Testament prophecy, the second stage, when He
   returns to the earth, is referred to in numerous Old Testament
   predictions. 8. The first stage of Christ's Return will be followed by
   God's blessings being poured upon the earth, and by the Holy Spirit
   being poured out upon all flesh. 9. The first stage will be followed by
   Satan coming down to this earth in great wrath (Rev. 12:9), the second
   will be followed by Satan being removed from the earth for a thousand
   years (Rev. 20:2, 3). 10. Between the present hour and the first stage
   of Christ's Return nothing intervenes, no prophecy needs first to be
   fulfilled, for our Lord may return at any moment; but before the second
   stage of Christ's Return can occur many prophecies must first be
   fulfilled. 11. Concerning the first stage of our Lord's Return we "wait
   for God's Son from heaven" (1 Thess. 1:10), whereas the second stage is
   distinguished as "the coming of the Son of Man." 12. The first stage
   was typified by the translation of Enoch to heaven (Heb. 11:5), the
   second was foreshadowed by Elijah who has yet to return to this earth
   to herald the judgments of the great and terrible day of the Lord (Mal.
   4:5). 13. The first stage is our Lord's Coming as our Saviour (Heb.
   9:28), the second is His return to earth as King(Rev. 19:11, 16). 14.
   The first stage will be followed by the saints coming before the
   "judgment-seat" (Bema) of Christ to be judged according to their works
   and rewarded for their service ((2 Cor. 5:10), the second will be
   followed by the "Throne of glory" upon which shall set the Son of Man
   who will judge the nations that are upon earth at the beginning of His
   millennial reign and apportion them their positions in His Kingdom
   (Matt. 25:31-46). Here then is the double bearing of the Fact of the
   Redeemer's Return--it respects first His own people and then the whole
   world.

   These two stages in the Redeemer's Return are in strict accord with the
   order of events which transpired at His First Advent. At the first
   coming of the Lord Jesus there was a secret or private manifestation of
   Himself, and subsequently a public revelation. The newly-born Saviour
   was actually seen by very few. The shepherds in the field, the wise men
   from the East, Anna and Simeon in the temple saw the Redeemer in the
   days of His infancy, but Herod and Pilate, the scribes and the
   Pharisees--the unbelieving civic and religious heads--saw Him not!
   After His return from Egypt on the death of Herod, He retired to
   Nazareth and it was not until an interval of nearly thirty years had
   passed that He was publicly manifested. Thus will it be at His second
   coming. First there will be the secret manifestation (in the air) unto
   His own people, and then after an interval of seven years or more He
   will be publicly revealed to the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. The Fact of the Redeemer's Return was typified in the lives of Joseph and
  Solomon.

   In the Old Testament there are numerous references to the Second Coming
   of Christ, references both direct and typical, but in every instance it
   was His return to the earth which was in view. The secret coming of
   Christ into the air, to catch up the saints to Himself, was an event
   quite unknown to the Old Testament prophets, an event kept secret until
   revealed by God to the apostle Paul who, when writing to the
   Corinthians upon this particular aspect of our subject, said, "Behold,
   I show you a mystery [7] (footnote); We shall not all sleep, but we
   shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
   last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
   incorruptible, and we shall be changed" (1 Cor. 15:51, 52).

   Many of the Old Testament characters were remarkable types of Christ:
   In Adam we see Christ's headship; in Abel, Christ put to death by His
   own brethren according to the flesh; in Enoch, Christ's ascension to
   heaven; in Noah, Christ providing a "refuse" for His own; in
   Melchizedek, Christ's Kingship; in Abraham, Christ's Nazariteship; in
   Isaac, Christ the willing Sacrifice; in Jacob, Christ toiling for a
   "bride;" in Moses, Christ the faithful Servant; in Aaron, Christ the
   great High Priest; in Joshua, Christ conducting His people into their
   inheritance. And so we might continue right through the Old Testament.

   Foremost among the typical personages of the Old Testament is Joseph.
   In almost every detail of his life we see Christ typified. The son of
   his father's love, yet the object of his brethren's bitter hatred. His
   very name meaning "adding" as Christ is adding to the inhabitants of
   Heaven by the seed which issues from His travail. Sent by his father to
   inquire after his brethren's welfare, he is despised and rejected by
   them. They plot against his life and sell him into the hands of
   strangers. While yet in his youth he was carried down into Egypt. In
   Egypt he entered into the degradation of slavery and rendered faithful
   service to his master. He was sorely tempted yet sinned not, but though
   innocent he was falsely accused and cast into prison. While in
   prison--the place of shame--he was associated with two others, one of
   whom--the butler--heard from his lips a message of cheer telling of his
   restoration to the king's favor, the other--the baker--receiving the
   sentence of death. So, when the Lord Jesus hung upon the Cross--the
   place of shame--two malefactors were crucified with Him one of whom
   heard from His lips a message of cheer telling of his restoration to
   God's favor, while the other died in his sins. Surely such perfect
   typification of Christ, such numerous points of analogy are not so many
   co-incidences, but are a Divine delineation of the person and work of
   the Redeemer--a picture drawn by the hand of the Holy Spirit Himself!
   If then the type is perfect, if the picture be complete, ought we not
   to look for something in it which foreshadowed our Lord's exaltation
   and coming glory? Assuredly. Nor do we look in vain--The sequel to
   Joseph's humiliation clearly pointed forward to the Return of our Lord
   to this earth in power and majesty.

   Above, we followed the typical history of Joseph to the point where he,
   through no fault of his own, was sentenced to suffer the shame of being
   cast into an Egyptian prison. But at this point of Joseph's life there
   was a dramatic change. Joseph's history did not terminate in shame and
   suffering but in power and glory. From the dungeon he was exalted to
   Egypt's throne! And, mark, his sovereignty was foretold years before he
   entered into the enjoyment of it. As a boy he dreamed of seeing the
   other sheaves all bowing down before his, which signified that his
   brethren would yet pay homage to him. So the prophetic Scriptures bear
   witness to the coming sovereignty of our Lord over this earth many
   centuries before He actually takes the scepter in His hands. After his
   exaltation to the Throne of Egypt Joseph's sovereignty was publicly
   recognized and acknowledged, for all men were compelled to "bow the
   knee" before him (Gen. 41:42), and thus will it be with our Saviour
   when He takes unto Himself His power and sits upon the Throne of His
   Glory. To complete the picture, we find that after Joseph's exaltation
   his brethren were reconciled to him, and then in wondrous grace they
   are given a land in which to dwell--the land of Goshen, the best in all
   Egypt; so when Christ returns to earth His brethren according to the
   flesh--Israel--shall be reconciled to Him and receive from Him the land
   of Palestine in which to dwell throughout His beneficent reign. Thus,
   as Joseph was exalted to power and glory after the period of his
   humiliation was ended, so shall our blessed Redeemer yet return to
   earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of lords.

   In the glorious reign of Solomon which followed the checkered career of
   David we have another striking type of the position which the Redeemer
   shall occupy during the Millennium. This is one of the composite types
   of Scripture. There are a number such where two or more objects or
   persons were necessary in order to give a complete picture. For
   example: in the great Levitical offerings (Lev. 1-6) we find five--the
   Burnt, the Meal, the Peace, the Sin, and the Trespass offerings--were
   required to give a complete foreshadowing of the person and work of the
   Redeemer. In the Tabernacle, no less than seven pieces of furniture in
   addition to its structure and materials, were needed to set forth fully
   the varied glories of Christ. So it was with reference to living
   persons. Enoch and Noah, Moses and Aaron, Elijah and Elisha
   supplemented each other in their typical characteristics. Thus it was
   with David and Solomon- the latter was the complement of the former and
   the two must be studied together in order to secure a complete picture.
   David was a type of Christ in His humiliation, Solomon foreshadowed
   Christ in His glorification, David pointed to Christ at His First
   Advent, Solomon looked forward to Christ at His Second Advent.

   In many particulars David typified the humiliation of his "greater
   son." He was born in Bethlehem of Judea. He is described as "of a
   beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon," thus reminding us of
   Him who "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and
   man," and who to the believer is the Fairest among ten thousand and the
   altogether Lovely One. By occupation he was a "shepherd," and during
   his shepherd life he repeatedly entered into conflict with wild beasts.
   He was preeminently a man of prayer and is the only one in all
   Scripture termed a "man after God's own heart." He was the one who slew
   Goliath--the opposer of God's people, and type of Satan, foreshadowing
   the conflict between the Serpent and the woman's Seed who, by His
   death, delivered God's people from the toils of their great Enemy. When
   his arch-enemy Saul was in his power he acted in great mercy by sparing
   his life, just as in Gethsemane our blessed Lord refused to summon the
   angels to destroy His foes and as on the Cross He prayed for the
   forgiveness of His murderers. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted
   with grief, suffering chiefly from those of His own household.

   After David came Solomon who foreshadowed the glory and the millennial
   reign of Christ. The word "Solomon" means "Peaceable" and thus his name
   suggests the Kingdom of Christ over which He shall rule as the "Prince
   of Peace." He was "anointed" some time before he was crowned: so the
   Lord Jesus was "anointed with the Holy Spirit" (Acts 10:38) at His
   baptism but is yet awaiting the day of His coronation. Gentiles took
   part in the crowning of Solomon (1 Kings 1:38, 39), typifying the
   universal homage which Christ shall receive during the Millennium. At
   the time of his coronation, Solomon was followed by an army of soldiers
   (the "Cherethites and the Pelethites") (1 Kings 1:38), just as our
   returning King shall be accompanied by "the armies in heaven" (Rev.
   19:14). Solomon was not only King of Israel but, like the One he
   foreshadowed, he was King of Kings (see 1 Kings 4:21, 24). During his
   reign "Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and
   under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of
   Solomon" (1 Kings 4:25): so it will be with Israel again during the
   Millennium (see Jer. 23:6). Solomon was the builder of Israel's Temple,
   so also we read of Christ that He will "return and will build again the
   tabernacle of David, which is fallen down" (Acts 15:16); and again,
   "Behold the Man whose name is the Branch; and He shall grow up out of
   His place, and He shall build the temple of the Lord" (Zech. 6:12). At
   the dedication of the Temple, Solomon was the one who offered up the
   sacrifices to God (1 Kings 8:63), thus foreshadowing the One who shall
   be "a priest upon His throne" (Zech. 6:13). Solomon's fame spread
   abroad far and wide so that "all the earth sought to Solomon" (1 Kings
   10:23) and came up to Jerusalem to pay him homage, and thus will it be
   with David's "son" and Lord--"It shall come to pass, that every one
   that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem, shall
   even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts"
   (Zech. 14:16). During Solomon's reign, for the first and last time
   until the Millennium, all Palestine rested in peace. The glory and
   majesty of Solomon's reign has never been equaled before or
   since--"King Solomon exceeded all the Kings of the earth for riches and
   for wisdom" (1 Kings 10:23); "And the Lord magnified Solomon
   exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such
   royal majesty as had not been on any King before him in Israel" (1
   Chron. 29:25). Thus we see that the peaceful, international, and
   glorious reign of Solomon, following the death of David, typified the
   millennial reign of the Redeemer.

  5. The Fact of the Redeemer's Return was foreshadowed in the Ritual on the
  annual day of Israel's Atonement.

   The order of events on the Day of Atonement are described in Leviticus
   16, a chapter which is exceedingly rich in its typical signification.
   The Day of Atonement had to do with the putting away of Israel's sins,
   therefore, its dispensational application refers mainly to Israel
   though, as we shall see, the Church was also typically represented. We
   shall not now attempt anything more than a bare outline of the
   happenings of that most memorable day on Israel's sacred calendar. The
   order of its ritual was as follows:--

   First, Aaron washed in water and then attired himself in the holy linen
   garments. It is to be noted that Aaron was provided with two sets of
   garments--those which were "for glory and for beauty" (Ex. 28:2), and
   the plain linen garments which were used when he offered sacrifice to
   God: the change from the latter into the former is referred to in Lev.
   16:23, 24. It was the plain, linen garments which were worn by the high
   priest on the Day of Atonement, because, clad thus in robes of spotless
   white he prefigured the sinlessness of the One who came to put away sin
   by the sacrifice of Himself.

   Second, Aaron offered "a bullock of the sin-offering" to "make an
   atonement for himself and for his house"(vs. 6). Our Great High Priest
   was without sin, He "knew no sin," yet He became so identified with His
   people that God "made Him to be sin for us" (2 Cor. 5:20), hence in the
   type Aaron makes atonement not only for his "house" but for "himself"
   as well. But observe particularly "and for his house." That is where
   the Church is seen, the Church which by Peter is termed "a spiritual
   house, a holy priesthood" (1 Pet. 2:5; Heb. 3:6).

   Third, Aaron took two goats and presented them before the Lord at the
   door of the tabernacle where he cast lots upon them--"one lot for the
   Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat" (vss. 7, 8). The two goats
   bring before us the two great sides of Christ's cross-work, namely, the
   Divine and the human. The death of the Lord Jesus not only provided a
   salvation for lost sinners but it also vindicated and glorified God
   Himself. On the Cross Christ met the claims of God's justice, satisfied
   the demands of His holiness, vindicated His governmental rights and
   publicly exemplified His righteousness. "One lot for the Lord," then,
   is what God obtained in the death of His beloved Son.

   Fourth, the goat of the sin-offering was killed and its blood brought
   within the veil and sprinkled both upon and before the mercy-seat. (vs.
   15). The mercy-seat was God's "throne" in Israel. Observe that the
   blood was sprinkled but once upon the mercy-seat and seven times before
   it (vss. 14, 15). Once was sufficient to meet all the claims of God,
   for that which the blood of the goat typified--the "precious blood" of
   Christ--was of infinite value in the sight of heaven, but seven times
   it needed to be sprinkled to meet our deep, deep need in order to
   provide for us a perfect standing ground before God!

   Fifth, after making atonement for the holy place and the alter--showing
   there is that, even in our communion with and worship of God, which
   needs cleansing- Aaron laid both his hands on the head of the second,
   live, goat, and confessed over him "all the iniquities of the children
   of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, and putting
   them upon the head of the goat" and sending him away into the
   wilderness, into "a land not inhabited" (vss. 21, 22). Just as the
   first goat represented the great truth of propitiation, the Divine side
   of Christ's cross-work, the satisfying and glorifying of God, so this
   second goat represented the other great truth of substitution, the
   manward side of Christ's cross-work, the acting of the Lord Jesus as
   the Surety of His people and bearing away their sins "as far as the
   east is from the west." The laying on of the priest's hands upon the
   head of the innocent goat signified an act of identification, the
   counterpart of which now enables us to say by faith "I was crucified
   with Christ" (Gal. 2:20--Greek). The confession of Israel's iniquities
   over its head, intimated the transference of guilt, pointing forward,
   as it did, to Christ bearing "our sins in His own body on the tree" (1
   Pet. 2:24). The thrice repeated "all" evidenced the completeness of the
   atonement there made, and thus it was with the Anti type "who gave
   Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity" (Titus
   2:14). The sending away of the goat bearing Israel's sins into "a land
   not inhabited," typified the complete removal of sin; and blessed be
   God our sins have all been completely taken away so that it is written
   "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
   Jesus" (Rom. 8:1).

   Sixth, after atonement had been effected, the high priest came out of
   the Holy of Holies, attired himself in his robes of beauty and glory
   returned to the waiting Congregation in the outer court (vss. 23, 24).
   It is in this last act of Aaron that we arrive at the point which is
   specially germane to our present study. The Anti type, our great High
   Priest, has already made atonement and has passed through the veil into
   the Holy of Holies on high "now to appear in the presence of God for
   us," but soon He shall divest Himself of the sacrificial garments and
   attired in robes of glory and beauty He shall come forth to His waiting
   people whose sins and iniquities shall be remembered "no more for
   ever." It is to this coming forth of our High Priest that Heb. 9:28
   (speaking in the very language of the above type) refers--"So Christ
   was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for
   Him shall He appear the second time without sin (our sins gone) unto
   salvation." Thus we see that the Ritual of Israel's annual Day of
   Atonement foreshadowed not only the cross-work of Christ and His
   present session at God's right hand but that it also typified and
   looked forward to His return in glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. The Fact of the Redeemer's Return is illustrated in the Gospel narratives.

   We refer now to the incident of Christ walking over the water to the
   aid of His storm-tossed disciples, the dispensational significance of
   which has already been pointed out by several writers.

   Immediately after our Lord had fed the five thousand, He retired into a
   mountain while His disciples went down unto the sea, and entering into
   a ship, they essayed to journey to Capernaum. But as they rowed "the
   sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew." It was dark, and Jesus
   was not come to them, and all the progress they had made after hours of
   hard rowing was "twenty-five or thirty furlongs." Then it was that
   Jesus drew nigh, and with a gracious "It is I; be not afraid" He
   stilled their fears. The statement that follows is a remarkable
   one--"Then they willingly received Him into the ship: and immediately
   the ship was at the land whither they went"(John 6:15-21). At the risk
   of being considered "fanciful" we shall attempt to expound the typical
   and dispensational bearings of the above incident.

   Christ on the mount, praying, points to His present position on high
   where He is interceding for us at the right hand of God. The restless,
   tossing sea, aptly figures the world's unrest in its opposition to God.
   The ship in the midst of the sea represents the Church which is in the
   world but not of it. The storm beating down upon the ship caused by the
   "great wind" that blew, prefigures the attacks and assaults upon the
   Church by the "Prince of the power of the air," seeking to destroy it
   during the time of Christ's absence. The rowing of the disciples and
   their failure to make headway against the storm, shows the
   powerlessness of the Church to improve the world as such. Nineteen
   centuries of Gospel preaching and Christian witnessing have failed to
   effect any real change in the world at large. The unrest of the world
   still continues, its hostility while not so open is yet just as real,
   and Christ is "hated" as bitterly as ever. The Church may pull at its
   oars, but it cannot still the sea--the storm will not be hushed until
   the Lord Jesus appears! All that the disciples could do was to keep the
   ship from sinking, and in that they were successful. There again our
   type is perfect. The world may be hostile to the Church and Satan may
   fling his angry winds and waves against it but, as its Founder
   declared, His church is built upon the Rock and "the gates of Hades
   shall not prevail against it," and blessed be God they have not. After
   almost two thousand years of human and Satanic opposition, after every
   conceivable weapon has been employed to encompass its destruction,
   Christ's Church still survives. And in the midst of the storm; at the
   darkest hour, in the fourth watch, Christ came to the deliverance of
   His disciples. So it will be at His Second Advent: He will come back to
   and for the Church which He ransomed with His own blood. He came to His
   disciples and, be it noted, He appeared not with a word of reproach but
   with a message of cheer--"It is I; be not afraid." Thus will it be at
   the Redeemer's Return: He will descent from heaven with a shout of
   welcome, bringing joy and gladness to the hearts of His own. Observe
   the blessed sequel--"and immediately the ship was at the land whither
   they went." The typical meaning of this is obvious: when our Lord comes
   back again the Church's conflicts will be over, its journey is then
   completed, its voyage ended, its destined harbor is safely reached.
   "Even so, come, Lord Jesus.


   "For the coming of the Bridegroom,

   Whom, tho' yet unseen, we love;

   For the King of saints returning

   In His glory from above;

   For the shout that shakes the prison,

   For the trumpet loud and clear,

   For the voice of the archangel,

   The Church is waiting here.

   For the light beyond the darkness,

   When the reign of sin is done;

   When the storm has ceased its raging,

   And the heaven has been won;

   For the joy beyond the sorrow,

   Joy of the eternal year,

   For the resurrection splendor,

   We are waiting, waiting here."
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. The Fact of the Redeemer's Return had a spectacular setting forth on the
  Mount of Transfiguration.

   The Transfiguration of Christ is perhaps as familiar as any of the
   leading events recorded in the four Gospels, yet is it less understood
   than the other great crises in His blessed life. The purpose and
   meaning of the Transfiguration is defined in the closing verse of
   Matthew 16--"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
   shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in His
   Kingdom." This is a verse which has puzzled many Bible readers, yet its
   meaning is simple if we pay heed to its exact wording. Observe that
   Christ did not here say, "There be some standing here which shall not
   taste of death till the Son of man come in His Kingdom" but "until they
   see the Son of man coming in His Kingdom." The little word "See"
   furnishes the key to the above declaration. Observe further, that our
   Lord said to his disciples, "There be some standing here, which shall
   not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in His
   Kingdom."

   The above verse is the closing one of Matthew 16 and it is exceedingly
   unfortunate that a chapter division has been made to immediately follow
   it and thus obscure its real meaning to many readers. What follows in
   the next chapter is the fulfillment of Christ's promise to the
   disciples as is clear from its opening statement--"And after six days
   Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up
   into a high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them"--the
   "And" connecting Matthew 17 with chapter 16, the "after six days"
   dating from the promise given the disciples, and the "some" finding its
   fulfillment in "Peter, James, and John." Here then is the key to the
   significance of the Transfiguration scene--it was the disciples seeing
   "the Son of Man coming in His Kingdom:" it was a pattern and sample of
   the glory in which our Lord shall return to the Mount of Olives; it was
   a visible representation, a spectacular setting forth of each of the
   leading elements which shall be found in Christ's Millennial Kingdom.
   To particularize.

   "And after six days"--"about an eight days after" (Luke). Every detail
   in the description of this remarkable event is worthy of our closest
   study. A careless and flippant reader might ask, "Why are we told that
   our Lord was transfigured just six days after He had given His promise
   to the disciples?--What does it matter to us whether it was six or
   sixteen days?" But the reverent student of Holy Scripture has learnt
   that everything in God's Word has a meaning and value. "Six days
   after," then it was a seventh-day scene, a Sabbatical scene, in a
   word--a Millennial scene. Some students will differ from us upon this
   point, but we record it as our belief that the above words furnish
   Scriptural verification of a view which was commonly held by the
   ancients, by the Rabbis and by the Church "Fathers," namely, that in
   line with the statement found in 2 Pet. 3:8--"One day is with the Lord
   be regarded as a definition of the duration of earth's history, i.e.,
   six thousand years of toil and labor followed by a thousand years of
   rest and peace, the Sabbath-day thus pointing forward to the
   Millennium.

   "And his face did shine as the sun, and His rainment was white as the
   light" (Matt. 17:2). With this statement should be compared Peter's
   inspired commentary--"For we have not followed cunningly devised
   fables, when we make known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He received
   from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to
   Him from the excellent Glory (i. e., the Shekinah Glory), "This is My
   beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. And this Voice which came from
   heaven we hear, when we were with Him in the holy mount" (2 Pet.
   1:16-18). During the days of Christ's humiliation when He endured the
   contradiction of sinners against Himself, we are told, "His visage was
   so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men"
   (Is. 52:14), but here on the Mount of Transfiguration "His face did
   shine as the sun." The disciples were favored with a glimpse of Christ
   in His resurrection glory! It is thus He now appears in Heaven as is
   evident from the blinding effects of Christ's glory as manifested to
   Saul of Tarsus on the Damascus road. And it is thus He will appear when
   He shall return to this earth, arising as "The Sun of righteousness
   with healing in His wings" (Mal. 4:2).

   "And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with
   Him" (vs. 3). From the fact that Moses (representative of the Law) and
   Elijah (standing for the Prophets) were with Christ at this time we may
   learn that the Old Testament saints shall have their part and place
   with Christ in His Millennial Kingdom. There is also another fact
   revealed here--precious thought!--when our Lord returns to the earth He
   will be accompanied by two classes of saints here represented by Moses
   and Elijah, namely, those who have passed through death and those who
   have been "changed" and raptured to heaven without seeing death. The
   three disciples--Peter, James, and John--may be regarded as
   representatives of the Church, not, of course, the Church in its Divine
   unity, but in individual capacity.

   "While He yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
   behold a voice out of the cloud which said, This is My beloved Son, in
   whom I am well pleased: hear ye Him" (vs. 5). The mention of the
   "bright cloud" here is deeply significant, the more so as it was out of
   it that the Voice of God was heard speaking. This was the "Cloud" which
   had been withdrawn from Israel centuries before but which now suddenly
   appeared again. This was the "Cloud" in which Jehovah appeared of
   old--the Cloud of the Shekinah glory. It was the "Cloud" which filled
   the Tabernacle--"Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and
   the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle" (Ex. 40:34). This was the
   "Cloud" which guided Israel throughout their wilderness
   wanderings--"And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle,
   the children of Israel went forward in all their journeys: but if the
   cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it
   was taken up" (Ex. 40:36, 37). This was the "Cloud" in which Jehovah
   appeared in the Holy of Holies upon the mercy-seat (Lev. 16:2). This
   was the "Cloud" which filled the Temple of Solomon (1 Kings 8:10).
   Little wonder then that the disciples "fell on their faces and were
   sore afraid" (vs. 7)! The appearing of the Shekinah "Cloud" on the
   mount of transfiguration was the intimation that it shall be visible to
   Israel again in the Millennial Kingdom. That it will be is further
   evident from the prophecy of Is. 4:5--"And the Lord will create upon
   every dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud
   and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for above
   all the glory shall be a defense"--the context here, shows that this
   has reference to the Millennium. See further Ezek. 43.

   "And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus
   only" (vs. 8). This touch to the picture is a very beautiful one. It
   tells us that in the Millennium our blessed Lord shall be exalted high,
   above all, that He shall occupy the position of pre-eminency, that all
   human glories shall pale and disappear before His. As it is written,
   "And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of
   men shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day"
   (Is. 2:17).

   The hour when the Transfiguration occurred is significant. From Luke's
   account we gather that it happened at night, for we read, "But Peter
   and they that were with him were heavy with sleep" (Luke 9:32). Thus
   will it be at the close of the long, dark night of Israel's
   dispersion--they shall look up and behold their Messiah returning in
   power and glory, accompanied by ten thousands of His saints who shall
   be on such terms of holy familiarity with Him (compare "Moses and
   Elijah talking with Him") that the world shall marvel at that wondrous
   grace which made them "joint-heirs with Christ."

   The Transfiguration also revealed the blessedness of that time when
   Christ shall set up His millennial Kingdom. "Lord, it is good for us to
   be here" (vss. 4) was the exclamation that fell from the lips of the
   astonished Peter. Thus will it be in the Millennium. "Lord, it is good
   for us to be here" will well express the contentment and the joy of
   those who will be upon earth in those days. O! what a time that will
   be. Satan removed, the Antichrist destroyed, and all that opposes the
   Gospel swept from the face of the earth. Israel penitent and restored,
   the heathen nations then completely evangelized, and creation itself
   delivered from its bondage of corruption. The saints "with Christ,"
   wearing their glorified bodies and participating in His reign over an
   earth full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord. Christ Himself on
   the throne, the Holy Spirit poured out upon all flesh, and outwardly,
   God's will done upon the earth as it is in heaven. Yes, then indeed,
   shall it be said, "Lord, it is good to be here."

   Striking indeed was the vision vouchsafed to the three favored
   disciples. Remarkably full was that manifestation of the glory of
   Messiah's coming Kingdom. But, the sequel to the Transfiguration was
   equally wonderful in its typical signification, and was needed to
   complete this spectacular setting forth of the Redeemer's Return to the
   earth.

   "And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a certain
   man, kneeling down to Him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son: for
   he is a lunatic, and sore vexed: for oftentimes he falleth into the
   fire, and oft into the water.** And Jesus rebuked the demon: and he
   departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour" (vss.
   14, 15, 18). What a sight was this which confronted our Lord and His
   disciples as they came down from the "holy mount"! What a picture of
   Israel in particular and of the world in general! Thus will it be at
   the time of our Lord's Return to this earth. The first thing which the
   Saviour did after He had given the disciples a vision of His glory in
   the coming Kingdom, was to cast out a demon; and the first thing He
   will do when He returns to the earth, will be to cast out the Devil and
   secure him for a thousand years in the Bottomless Pit (Rev. 20:2, 3).
   God hasten that blessed day!

   Thus we see that the Fact of the Redeemer's Return not only occupies a
   prominent position in the didactic instruction of the Church Epistles,
   but that it was also the subject of Old Testament prophecy and
   typology, was pictorially illustrated in the miracles recorded in the
   Gospels, and received a spectacular setting forth in the wonderful
   scene which was enacted upon the Mount of Transfiguration.

                                  Chapter Four

                       The Time of the Redeemer's Return


   "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the

   sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and

   the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the

   heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the

   sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all

   the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see

   the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven

   with power and great glory" (Matt. 24:29, 30).

   Having shown the Necessity of Christ's Return, having dwelt upon the
   Hope of His appearing, having pondered some of the bearings and types
   of the Fact of His Second Advent, we are now ready to discuss the Time
   of His Return and to consider the question--When is our Lord coming
   back again? By the "Time" of the Redeemer's Return we do not mean the
   date, but the position which this great event occupies in God's
   dispensational programme. Concerning this phase of our subject there is
   wide difference of opinion. Two positions have been taken and the
   advocates of each appeal to the Scriptures in support of their
   conflicting views. These two positions are known as Pre-millennialism
   and Post-millennialism. The word "millennium" means a thousand years,
   and "pre" means before and "post" means after. One school of
   theologians believe and teach that the Lord Jesus will return before
   the Millennium, another school insist that He will not come back again
   until the close of the Millennium, in fact not until the end of the
   world, the end of time itself. As the point at issue between these
   schools is of great importance and as this book may fall into the hands
   of a number of people who are bewildered by this contradictory
   testimony and who are anxious to know what the Scriptures really say
   upon the matter, we have decided to devote a separate chapter to an
   examination of the question--Will Christ return before or after the
   Millennium?

   When is our Lord coming back again? In seeking a satisfactory and
   authoritative answer to this question our first need is a candid mind,
   and unprejudiced heart, a teachable spirit. It is impossible for us to
   grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord while we cling to our
   own pre-conceptions. The initial requirement in every student of Holy
   Scripture is that he shall bow to the authority of the Word and
   submissively receive at its face value all that God has revealed. We
   need to approach the Sacred Volume in the attitude of learners, willing
   to have our own ideas of Truth corrected, and prepared to have our
   beliefs formed and moulded by the teaching of Holy Writ. Such as
   assertion may perhaps appear a platitude, yet we are fully assured that
   it is a timely reminder. One of the main hindrances which prevents many
   of God's children apprehending Divine Truth is that they read the Bible
   through the eyes of others; they read it with opinions already firmly
   formed, they read it with prejudicial interest. This is largely true
   with reference to the subject of our present inquiry. People have been
   taught by some "Doctor of Divinity," or Seminary professor that the
   world is growing better, that the Gospel will eventually win all men to
   Christ, and that the Millennium is to be ushered in by the efforts of
   the church. It is difficult for those who have been taught thus to set
   aside the effects of such teaching and come to the study of the Bible
   to find out exactly what it says concerning these things. Yet we must
   do so if we would learn God's mind on the matter. It is "What saith the
   Scriptures?" not What does our church teach? not What does our Creed or
   Catechism say? not What did my godly parents tell me? but--What saith
   the Scriptures? We repeat, in seeking an answer to the question--When
   will our Lord return? Before or after the Millennium? we need to
   approach the Bible with an open mind, willing to be instructed by the
   One who inspired it, and coming to it in the spirit of the child Samuel
   saying, "Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth."

   What is the Time of our Lord's Return? As stated above, two general
   answers are returned to this question. One class of theologians argue
   that our Lord will not come back again until after the Millennium;
   another class declare that He will return before the Millennium. In
   order to be fair to each of these schools we will first give a brief
   description of their respective positions.
     __________________________________________________________________

I. Post and Pre-millennialism Defined.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. The position of Post-millennialism.

   Post-millennialists teach that the great purpose of the Divine
   incarnation was that the Lord Jesus through His death and resurrection
   should found and establish a spiritual Kingdom. They tell us that the
   Jews who expected their Messiah to set up a material and visible
   Kingdom on the earth were mistaken. They insist that the only Kingdom
   Christ has or will ever have is an unseen, spiritual and heavenly
   Kingdom, the subjects of which are the members of His Church, in whose
   hearts Christ now rules. They declare that the Redeemer is even now
   reigning, reigning as King over this earth and that he will continue
   thus to reign, unseen, until He has overcome all enmity and opposition
   and won His very enemies unto Himself. The instrument by which He is to
   achieve this glorious victory is the church, and the church, we are
   told, is here to civilize as well as evangelize the earth.
   Post-millennialists teach that while the Church is an institution and
   organization separate from the State yet is it interested in the
   welfare of the State and that it is the duty of Christ's followers to
   take part in politics and see to it that the best men securable are
   elected to office and that they must be encouraged to frame and enforce
   laws which make for civic and social righteousness.

   In present-day conditions post-millennarians see the fulfilling of
   their hopes and the promise of a speedy success crowning their efforts.
   They regard the multiplication of educational advantages, the
   discoveries and inventions of modern science, the improvements in
   hygienic and sanitary conditions, the growing demand for nation-wide
   prohibition, the increasing number of hospitals and agencies to relieve
   suffering, the modern trend toward interdenominationalism and religious
   unionism, as so many heralds of the near approach of the Millennium.
   They believe that the utilization and perfecting of such agencies will
   usher in the Golden Age, an age of world peace and prosperity, an age
   when all will know the Lord from the least to the greatest. It is not
   until the close of this Millennium that they look for Christ to return:
   then it is they expect Him to come back and "wind up" all things, judge
   the human race and settle the eternal destiny of every individual of
   it. Post-millenarians believe in a general resurrection and a general
   judgment at the end of time. Such a brief and in general is the
   position and belief held by post-millennialists. We turn now to
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The position of Pre-millennialism.

   At every point the teaching of pre-millennarians is diametrically
   opposed to that of the post-millennialists. Pre-millenarians regard the
   Jewish expectation of a literal, visible, material Kingdom as being set
   up on the earth by their Messiah as a hope authorized by the Word of
   God because clearly revealed and expressly foretold by the Old
   Testament prophets. They believe this Messianic Kingdom is now in
   abeyance but will yet be established. They do not hold that Christ is
   now reigning as King, on the contrary, they look upon Him as at present
   exercising His high-priesthood, and they do not expect Him to enter
   into the office of His kingship until He returns to the earth and sits
   upon the throne of His father David.

   Pre-millennialists do not believe that it is the mission of the Church
   to civilize the world, but instead, they are deeply impressed that the
   great duty and business of the Church is to evangelize the nations.
   While recognizing that civilization is a bi-product of evangelism, yet
   they insist that their marching orders are contained in Christ's
   mandate--Go, preach the Gospel to every creature. Believing this, and
   realizing that a full obedience to their Lord's command will require
   all their strength, time and talents, they (or, at least, an increasing
   number of them) look upon politics, social-reform movements,
   humanitarian efforts, etc. as outside of their own jurisdiction, as
   something which is an integral part of that world from which their
   Master was cast out, the "friendship" of which is expressly declared to
   be "Enmity with God" (Jas. 4:4). While they rest with unshaken
   confidence upon the Divine promise that God's Word shall not return
   unto Him void but that it shall accomplish that which He pleases and
   prosper in the thing whereto He sends it, and while they go forth
   preaching the Gospel in the assurance that the Holy Spirit will use and
   bless it to the conversion of many of those that hear it, yet
   pre-millennialists can find on promise anywhere in the New Testament
   that the world as a whole shall improve during the time of Christ's
   absence from it; on the contrary, they read that "In the last days
   perilous times shall come" and that "Evil men and seducers shall wax
   worse and worse"(2 Tim. 3:1, 13).

   Pre-millennialists do not believe there can be any Millennium until
   Christ returns to the earth, takes its government upon His shoulder,
   and reigns in power over it. They do not believe that there can be any
   real improvement in moral and spiritual conditions down here while
   Satan is free, and realizing the utter impotency of man to cope with
   his powerful Enemy they recognize that the only hope for this poor
   world is the Second Advent of Christ to earth and His removal of Satan
   from it. They believe that before this can happen Christ will first
   come for His Church and instead of interposing a thousand years between
   the present and this blessed event, they are looking for Him to return
   at any moment. Such in brief and in general is the belief and position
   of pre-millennialism.

   Now it is very evident that both of these positions cannot be sound and
   tenable, that one of them must be false and unscriptural.
   Post-millennialism and pre-millennialism cannot both be right, one of
   them is most certainly wrong. Which of them is in error? Again we would
   urge upon our readers the need of drawing near to God and praying Him
   for a teachable spirit and asking Him to enable them to approach the
   examination of this issue with an unprejudiced mind and an open heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

II. Post and Pre-millennialism Examined.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. An examination of Post-millennialism.

   Post-millennialists teach that the only Kingdom over which Christ will
   ever reign is a spiritual and celestial one. They say that those Jews
   who expected their Messiah to set up a visible and material Kingdom on
   the earth were mistaken, that they erred in the interpretation of their
   prophetic Scriptures and cherished a carnal and unworthy hope. Let us
   examine this assertion in the light of God's Word. In Psalm 132:11 we
   read "The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David; He will not turn from
   it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne." This was one
   of many Messianic prophecies scattered throughout the Old Testament
   Scriptures. It is a prophecy which has never yet been fulfilled. When
   our Lord Jesus was here upon earth He did not sit upon any "throne,"
   instead of occupying a Throne He was nailed to a cross. True, He is now
   seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high, but this is not the
   fulfillment of what Jehovah "swore in truth." David never occupied a
   heavenly throne; his throne was an earthly one, he reigned in
   Jerusalem; and God has declared that the Lord Jesus shall sit upon
   David's throne. This Old Testament prophecy was confirmed in New
   Testament times. In Luke one we learn that an angel appeared unto Mary
   and said, "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. And,
   behold, thou shalt call His name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be
   called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the
   throne of His father David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob
   for ever; and of His Kingdom there shall be no end" (Luke 1:30-33).

   The above is not a single prophecy but a compound one. It is made up of
   five separate items. Mary, the "virgin," was to conceive and bring
   forth a son; her son's name was to be called "Jesus;" Jesus was to
   become great and recognized as the Son of God; the Lord promised to
   give unto Him the "throne of David," and over the "House of Jacob" He
   was to reign for ever. Utterly unlikely as it appeared to human wisdom
   at the time, part of this prophecy has already been
   fulfilled--literally fulfilled. There was a literal birth, Mary's son
   was literally named "Jesus," and a literal "greatness" has become His
   portion; by what sleight of hand then can the exegetical knife be run
   through this prophecy and a literal reign over the "House of Jacob" be
   denied?

   Post-millennialists teach that Christ is reigning as King to-day and
   that He will continue to reign thus, unseen, until He has subdued and
   won all His enemies. But the first part of this assertion is altogether
   lacking in scriptural authority. Nowhere in the New Testament are we
   told that Christ has already begun His Kingly reign, and nowhere in the
   Epistles is He denominated the "King of the Church." It is true that
   Christ is now seated upon a "throne," but not upon His own Throne.
   Christ is seated on the Throne of His Father, but His own Throne and
   the Father's Throne are clearly distinguished in Scripture--To him that
   overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My Throne, even as I also
   overcame, and am set down with My Father in His Throne" (Rev. 3:21). It
   is not until after He has vacated His Father's Throne and returns to
   this earth that He will occupy His own throne as is clear from Matt.
   25:31--"When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy
   angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the Throne of His glory."

   Post-millennialists teach that the world is to be conquered by the
   Church. Their favorite slogan is "The world for Christ." It is supposed
   that in order to capture the world the Church must make concessions to
   and compromises with the world. Post-millennialists insist that it is
   the bounden duty of all Christians to help forward every movement which
   makes for civic and social righteousness. But of such it may be said,
   yea, it has been said by the Holy Spirit Himself--"For they being
   ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own
   righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of
   God" (Rom. 10:3). The New Testament knows no righteousness apart from
   the Cross and places no value upon a reformation which is divorced from
   regeneration. Post-millennialists argue that believers ought to take
   part in politics and that it is their business to look after the
   regulation of legislation. But politics gave Christ no place and where
   Christ has no place His followers must have none. The Lord Jesus has
   left us an example that we should follow His steps, but we search the
   records of His earthly life in vain to discover any mention of Him
   taking part in the politics of Palestine in His day.

   Post-millennialists teach that the Gospel is yet to convert the world
   and that before Christ returns to earth all men will know Him from the
   least unto the greatest. A captivating concept surely, but upon what is
   it based? Certainly not upon the declarations of the New Testament. We
   are commanded to preach the Gospel to every creature, but nowhere is
   there a promise that the time will come when every creature will
   believe the Gospel. The Lord Jesus taught that "As the days of Noah
   were, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be" (Matt. 24:37).
   What were the conditions in Noah's days? Did all men then then receive
   the messengers of God's servants? Nay verily: On another occasion
   Christ said, "Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat,
   they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the
   same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
   heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be when the Son of
   Man is revealed" (Luke 17:28-30)--do these words present the picture of
   our Lord returning to a world which has been won by the Gospel? Nay
   verily. Our Lord very plainly intimated that He did not expect to
   return to a world where Christianity had universally triumphed: "When
   the Son of Man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?' (Luke 18:8)!

   Post-millennialists teach that our Lord will not return until the close
   of the Millennium and that then there will be a general resurrection of
   the dead, followed by a general judgment, at which every member of the
   human race will stand before the great Judge to have his eternal
   destiny decided. Such a conception is anti-scriptural in every part of
   it. In the nineteenth chapter of Revelation we see Heaven opened and
   the Lord Jesus coming forth seated on a white horse and with Him are
   the "armies which are in heaven." Accompanied by His saints the King of
   Kings and Lord of lords returns to this earth as is evident from the
   next verse, for there we are told that He shall "smite the nations and
   rule them with a rod of iron." In Rev. 19 Christ is seen making a
   footstool of His enemies preparatory to the inauguration of His reign
   of blessing, and in the next chapter we read, "And I saw an angel come
   down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great
   chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, that old serpent,
   which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years. And cast
   him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him,
   that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years
   should be fulfilled" (Rev. 20:1-3). In the verses that follow we are
   told that those who have part in the first resurrection shall reign
   with Christ throughout the thousand years. Thus we learn that Christ
   leaves heaven and returns to the earth before the Millennium commences.
   The concept of a general resurrection and a general judgment is equally
   un-scriptural as we shall show later.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. An examination of Pre-millennialism.

   Pre-millennialists, as their name indicates, are looking for their
   Redeemer to return before the Millennium begins, looking for Him to
   introduce and usher in the Millennium itself. To them a Millennium
   without Christ is unthinkable. From their cradles they have been taught
   to pray, "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is done in
   heaven," and they cannot conceive of a Kingdom without a King. The
   Millennium is the time when men's desire for a Golden Age will be
   realized, but that Golden Age cannot dawn until the Sun of
   righteousness arises with healing in His wings. The Millennium is the
   time when the sword shall be made into a plough-share and the spear
   into the prunning-hook, when for a thousand years there shall be no
   war, but earth-wide peace will only be made possible by the return and
   personal presence of the Prince of Peace.

   Pre-millenialists believe that in the Millennium Christ will set up on
   the earth a visible, material Kingdom, that He will occupy the literal
   throne of David and reign from Jerusalem as the King of the Jews. They
   base their belief upon many plain declarations in Scripture to that
   effect. Isaiah predicted it--"And it shall come to pass in that day,
   that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high,
   and the Kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered
   together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in
   the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. Then the moon
   shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall
   reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before His ancients
   gloriously." Ezekiel foretold it--"And He said unto me, Son of man, the
   place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will
   dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever, and My holy name,
   shall the House of Israel no more defile by their admonitions that they
   have committed" (Ezek. 43:7), while at the close of his prophecy he
   says of Jerusalem in the Millennium, "And the name of the city from
   that day shall be, The Lord is there." Zephaniah heralded it--"Sing, O
   daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with the heart,
   O daughter of Jerusalem. The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, He
   hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even the Lord, is in the
   midst of thee" (Zeph. 3:14-17). Zechariah announced it--"Sing and
   rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the
   midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be joined to the
   Lord in that day, and shall be My people: and I will dwell in the midst
   of thee, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent Me unto
   thee. And the Lord shall inherit Judah His portion in the holy land and
   shall choose Jerusalem again" (Zech. 2:10-12, and see further 8:3, 23
   and 14:16).

   Pre-millenialists believe that the Messianic reign and Kingdom of the
   Lord Jesus are yet future. They believe that Christ Himself so taught.
   In the Parable of the Nobleman, He declared, "A certain nobleman went
   into a far country to receive for Himself a Kingdom," and to return.
   And it came to pass, that when He was returned, having received the
   kingdom, then He commanded these servants to be called unto Him, to
   whom He had given the money, that he might know how much every man had
   gained by trading" (Luke 19:12, 15). Here we learn that Christ's return
   and His reception of the "Kingdom" are inseparably connected together.
   Not only do the Scriptures plainly refute the assertion that Christ is
   now reigning, but existing conditions cannot be made to square with
   this belief. How absurd it is to say that Christ is now reigning over
   the earth when His authority is despised and rejected by the whole of
   the unbelieving world! No Christ-rejector can be termed a follower of
   the Lamb, and if he is not a "follower" then he is not subject to the
   will and rule of the Lord Jesus, and if he is not subject to Christ,
   then in no sense is Christ his "King." Moreover, the conditions which
   prevail upon earth to-day repudiate the idea that Christ is even now
   reigning over it. The scepter which the first man lost has never been
   restored, the "Curse" has not yet been removed, and Satan is still at
   large! But all these things will be changed when the Lord Jesus takes
   the government upon His shoulder and reigns in power and righteousness.

   Pre-millennialists believe that it is God's purpose in this Age to take
   out of the nations "a people for His name" (Acts 15:14). To effect this
   the Gospel has been given and the Holy Spirit has come down to this
   earth. As the Gospel is preached, as many as are ordained to eternal
   life believe (Acts 13:48), for though "many be called," there are "but
   few chosen" (Matt. 20:16). God's purpose in this dispensation is an
   Elective one, and let it be said with emphasis, God's purpose has not
   failed, is not failing, will not fail--"Remember the former things of
   old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none
   like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
   the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I
   will do all My pleasure" (Is. 46:9, 10). The Gospel is not a failure,
   the Holy Spirit has not failed in His mission, it is theologians who
   have failed--failed to understand the purpose of God and to read aright
   His present programme.

III. Post-millennialism Refuted.

   The post-millennial position rests largely upon a mis-translation. In
   Matt. 13:39 we read "The harvest is the end of the world," and again in
   Matt. 24:3--"And as He sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came
   unto Him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and
   what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?" Now
   the Greek word which is used in the above passages is entirely
   different from the one found in John 3:16--"God so loved the Kosmos."
   In the verses quoted above the word is not "Kosmos" but aion and ought
   to have been rendered "age"--"the harvest is the end of the age." In
   the marginal rendering of the R. V. Matt. 13:39 reads "The harvest is
   the consummation of the age." Both of the Greek words which are
   translated "world" in the King James Version occur in Heb. 9:26--"For
   then must He often have suffered since the foundation of the Kosmos:
   but now once in the end of the aion hath He appeared to put away sin by
   the sacrifice of Himself." Here it is evident that "aion" cannot mean
   "world." The Lord Jesus was offered as a sacrifice for sin more than
   eighteen hundred years ago, and the end of the "world" has not come
   yet. It was at the consummation or end of the Mosaic age that our Lord
   appeared and died upon the cross in order to effect our salvation. So,
   in the above instances read, "The harvest is the end of the age," the
   present age and not the end of time, for just as the Mosaic age was
   followed by the Christian age, so the present Dispensation shall be
   followed by the Millennium. That the "harvest" referred to by our Lord
   in the Parable of the Tares takes place at the end of this age rather
   than at the end of the "world," is further seen by a comparison of Joel
   3:13-17 and Rev. 14:14-20 which refer to the same "harvest" and where
   this harvest is definitely placed at the commencement and not at the
   consummation of Messiah's reign. That our Lord will return before the
   Millennium rather than at its close is clear from many considerations.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. The condition of the world when our Lord returns proves that His Second
  Advent cannot be post-millennial.

   God's Word makes known the exact conditions which are to obtain here
   immediately preceding the Redeemer's Return. The Holy Spirit has given
   a number of graphic portrayals of the world as it will exist when our
   Lord comes back to it. One of these pictures is to be found in Isaiah
   2--"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is
   proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be
   brought low: And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and
   lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan. And upon all the high
   mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up. And upon every
   high tower, and upon every fenced wall, and upon all the ships of
   Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. And the loftiness of man
   shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and
   the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. And the idols He shall
   utterly abolish. And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and
   into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of
   His majesty, when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth. In that day a
   man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they
   made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; to
   go into the clefts of the rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the
   glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth." Do
   these verses picture a world ready to receive a returning Christ? No;
   they tell us that in "the Day of the Lord"--that which immediately
   follows the present "Day of Salvation"--men will be "proud and lofty;"
   it intimates that idolatry shall prevail universally; it tells us that
   instead of men coming forward to welcome the Lord Jesus, they shall
   flee from Him in terror.

   Another passage which describes the conditions which are to prevail on
   earth at the time of our Lord's Return is found in 2 Thess. 1:7-9--"And
   to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be
   revealed from heaven with His might angels, in flaming fire taking
   vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of
   our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting
   destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His
   power; when He shall come to be glorified in His Saints, and to be
   admired in all them that believe." Observe that here we are expressly
   told that our Lord comes back again to take vengeance on "them that
   know not God and that obey not the Gospel." It is utterly impossible to
   make this statement harmonize with the concept of Christ returning to a
   world which had previously been won to Him by the Gospel.

   Again, in 2 Pet. 3:3, 4 we read, "Knowing this first, that there shall
   come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and
   saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell
   asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
   creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of." Observe that the
   apostle is describing conditions that are to obtain in "the last days,"
   i.e., the last days of this present dispensation. Here again we learn
   then, that instead of this Age closing with the universal acceptation
   of the Gospel, instead of the last days witnessing a world reconciled
   to God, instead of the Christian era closing with earth-wide prayer for
   the Coming of the King, we are told that, "there shall come in the last
   days scoffers," a class of people who have no concern for God's glory
   but who walk after their own lusts; and further, we are told that these
   "scoffers" shall mock at those who are looking for the appearing of our
   Saviour and that the "ignorance" of these scoffers is due to a wilful
   and deliberate rejection of God's revealed truth.

   Putting together the above pictures we learn that in the days which
   precede Christ's Second Advent the earth will be filled with proud
   idolaters, with those that know not God and obey not the Gospel, and
   with those who mock and scoff at the prospect of a speedily returning
   Redeemer. Further; we learn that the actual return of Christ is
   introduced not by Gospel successes but by Divine judgments. Thus we say
   that the condition of the world when our Lord comes back to it proves
   that His Second Advent occurs not at the close of an era of Millennial
   blessedness, but at the end of a dispensation wherein God has dealt
   with infinite long-sufferance with a race of rebels, and that at His
   coming He takes "vengeance" on His enemies ere setting up His Messianic
   Kingdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The Teaching of Matthew 13 proves that no era of Millennial blessing
  precedes Christ's Second Advent.

   In Matt. 13 we have the record of seven parables--the number of
   completeness--which our Lord uttered consecutively. These parables are
   prophetic in their significance and scope. They deal with conditions
   which are to obtain here during the time of our Lord's absence. They
   are concerned with the visible profession of Christianity and they look
   forward to the closing scenes of the present dispensation. As there is
   much in them upon which we cannot now comment at length we shall
   content ourselves with singling out only that which bears upon our
   present inquiry.

   The chapter opens with the well-known Parable of the Sower who went
   forth to sow. It pictures the broad-cast sowing of the good Seed by the
   Saviour Himself, and in His interpretation of the parable we learn that
   the "Seed" is the Word of God. The parable sets before us the beginning
   of the Christian dispensation and makes known to us the manner and
   extent of the reception of the Redeemer's mission and message. It gives
   us the ratio of the Gospel's success and forewarns us that all men are
   not going to receive God's Word, that the majority will not, that only
   a fractional minority will. It shows us that the proclamation of the
   Word is to encounter Satanic opposition, yea, that the world, the
   flesh, and the Devil, will combine in their efforts to prevent it
   bringing forth fruit.

   The result of the sowing is plainly stated. Three castings out of four
   were fruitless! Most of the seed fell upon barren ground. The greater
   part of the field which, in our Lord's interpretation, we learn is "the
   world," completely failed to bring forth any increase. Some of the seed
   fell by the wayside and the fowls of the air picked it up; some fell
   upon the rocks and the sun burnt it up; some fell among thorns and it
   was choked. Only one fourth of it fell upon "good ground" and even
   there the fruitage varied and decreased in its yield from a
   hundred-fold to thirty-fold (see vs. 23). In His interpretation, the
   Lord tells us that the different kinds of ground on which the Seed fell
   represent various classes of people who hear the Word.

   Now what light does the above parable throw upon our present inquiry? I
   throws a clear light and in its light we discover the fallacy of the
   post-millennial position. There is no hint whatever in this parable
   that a time was to come when the whole of the field would be covered
   with waving wheat, instead, the only possible inference which can be
   drawn from it flatly repudiates such a conception. Who would dare to
   suggest that the Divine Sower Himself, the "Lord of the harvest" would
   be followed by other sowers who should prove more successful than He?
   The results of our Lord's own sowing were prophetic of the history of
   the entire Christian dispensation. In no period of this Age has the
   whole field--the world--been receptive to the Seed, in no period have
   more than a fractional minority received the Word and brought forth
   fruit unto perfection. In every generation, from the time when our Lord
   walked the earth in the days of His flesh until now, the emissaries of
   Satan and the cares and riches of the world have combined to choke and
   make unfruitful the Word of God. From this parable then it is
   impossible to deduce any promise of a world ultimately converted by the
   Gospel.

   The second of the parables found in Matt. 13--that of the Wheat and the
   Tares--brings out even more forcibly than the previous one the fact
   that there can be no Millennium of earth-wide blessedness before our
   Lord's return. The Parable of the Tares is also prophetic in its
   bearing. It makes known to us that which succeeded our Lord's own
   ministry. Immediately following the Divine Sower's scattering of the
   good Seed, an Enemy was "the Wicked One" and it is to be particularly
   noted that he sowed neither thorns nor thistles but "tares"--a bastard
   wheat--which so closely resembles the genuine article that the one
   cannot be distinguished from the other until the time of harvest. Here
   then is seen the efforts of the Evil One to neutralize the gracious
   work of the Son of God. The interpretation of this parable was supplied
   by the Lord Himself: just as the wheat represents the "children of the
   Kingdom," so the tares symbolize the "children of the Wicked One." Let
   it be noted, however, that the "tares" do not represent wicked men as
   such, but "the ministers of Satan," "false apostles, deceitful workers"
   (2 Cor. 11:13) who were secretly introduced by the Enemy amongst God's
   people just as the tares were sown among the wheat.

   Part of this parable began to be fulfilled in the days when the New
   Testament was written. In the false teachers who harassed the early
   disciples we may see the mingling of the tares with the wheat. The
   "children of the Wicked One" were the Judaizers who entered in among
   the churches of Galatia and who taught that salvation could not be
   secured by faith alone, that Circumcision was also necessary. The
   "tares" may be seen in Hymeneus and Philetus of whom we read, "who
   concerning the Truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past
   already; and overthrow the faith of some" (2 Tim. 2:17, 18). The
   apostle Peter referred to the same class when he wrote, "But there were
   false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false
   teachers among you, who privily ("secretly") shall bring in damnable
   heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon
   themselves swift destruction" (2 Pet. 2:1). Jude, likewise, had
   reference to such when he declared, "For there are certain men crept in
   unawares(as the "tares" were sown secretly among the wheat), who were
   before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
   grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God,
   and our Lord Jesus Christ" (Jude 4). Thus we see that at a very early
   date the tares were mingled with the wheat.

   Again we ask, What light does this parable throw upon the point now
   under discussion? And once more the answer is, much every way. In our
   Lord's declaration that the tares should grow together with the wheat
   until the time of harvest, which He expressly declares is the end of
   the age, we discover how preposterous, erroneous, and unscriptural is
   the teaching that the Gospel will yet win the world to Christ. At the
   time of harvest the world is still a mixed field, and this fact cuts
   away all ground for supposing that before our Lord returns the tares
   will be all rooted up or changed into wheat. Instead of the tares being
   transformed into wheat before the Millennium is ushered in, we are told
   that at the time of harvest the tares are bound into bunches and
   afterward cast into the fire--a very different picture that from the
   children of the Wicked One being reconciled to God! In the words "Let
   both grow together till the harvest" two solemn facts are
   revealed--first, Satan shall continue to hinder the success of the
   Gospel without interruption till the end of the age; and second, the
   Christian profession once corrupted shall continue thus to the close of
   the dispensation. And thus it has proven. Finally, be it observed, that
   in the casting of the tares--the children of the Wicked One--into the
   furnace of fire, we learn once more that the Age closes not with the
   universal reception of the Gospel but with Divine judgment upon the
   wicked!

   The third parable of Matt. 13--that of the Mustard-seed--differs from
   the former ones in that it was not interpreted by our Lord.
   Post-millennialists have taken advantage of this fact and have made it
   teach that which gives countenance to their own pre-conceived theories.
   In this parable they see the promise of a world conquered by the
   Gospel. Now, whatever this parable may or may not signify, it certainly
   must not be made to contradict the teaching of the two which have gone
   before it. As already stated, the seven parables recorded in Matt. 13
   form part of one connected discourse by our Lord and are so many
   prophetic representations of the development of the Christian
   profession during the time of His absence. This third parable then
   cannot set forth the universal diffusion of the Truth because the
   previous ones show that this is prevented by the opposition of Satan,
   which opposition is to continue until the end of the age. What then
   does this third parable teach?

   The position which this parable occupies in the series is one of the
   keys to its interpretation. The first parable is concerned with the
   beginning of this dispensation, the time when our Lord was here upon
   the earth. The second deals, prophetically, with conditions that
   obtained in the lifetime of the apostles, showing us the false
   teachers--the children of the Wicked One--who crept in among God's
   people in their day. This third parable then looks forward to a later
   period and presents a prophetic picture which saw its materialization
   in the fourth century of our era. The growth of the little mustard-seed
   into a great tree represents the development of the Christian
   profession from an insignificant commencement into a system of imposing
   proportions. In the fourth century A. D., Christianity was popularized
   by Constantine who adopted it as the State religion and compelled more
   than a million of his subjects to be baptized at the point of the
   sword. The parable of the Tares shows us Christianity corrupted by the
   insidious introduction of the children of the Wicked One among the
   children of God: the parable of the mustard-seed forecasted the growth
   and spread of a corrupted Christianity. This assertion of ours may
   easily be verified by the details of the parable itself.

   The mustard-seed developed into a great tree--an abnormal thing in
   itself, nay, a monstrosity - so the popularization of Christianity in
   the days of Constantine produced an unnatural and ungainly system which
   was foreign to its spirit and nature. Observe that the "fowls of the
   air" came and lodged in the branches of the great tree. In the first
   parable of the series the Lord Himself tells us that the birds of the
   air represent the emissaries of Satan. The great tree then, stands for
   a nominal and national Christianity, a monstrous, world-system, that
   which in our day is the aggregate of the so-called "Christian nations."
   In a word, the great tree symbolizes Christendom which in Rev. 18 is
   said to be the "hold of every foul spirit and a cage for every hateful
   bird."

   Further confirmation of our assertion above, that the great tree which
   issued from the mustard-seed represents the abnormal growth of a
   corrupted Christianity is furnished in Daniel 4 where we have recorded
   a dream which came to the first head of the Gentile powers. In this
   dream Nebuchadnezzar also saw a "great tree," and in the fate which it
   met with we learn the end which is appointed to the tree of our
   parable. To quote--"I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth,
   and the height thereof was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and
   the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the
   end of all the earth: The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit
   thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had
   shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
   thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. I saw in the visions of my head
   upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from
   heaven; He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off
   his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the
   beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches" (Dan.
   4:10-14).

   To sum up our comments upon this parable. Instead of lending favor to
   the position of post-millennialism, its teaching--viewed in the light
   of Daniel 4--absolutely shatters the foundation of that system. Instead
   of teaching that the professing Church shall conquer the world, it
   shows that the world has conquered the professing Church. The
   mustard-seed symbolizes the outward character of the Christian
   profession at the beginning of this dispensation, when its devotees
   were few in number, poor in this world's goods, and despised by the
   great ones of the earth. In the third century A. D., the professing
   Church was like unto a humble little seed, unpretentious in appearance
   and insignificant in its dimensions. But in the fourth century there
   was a dramatic change. Constantine became a nominal Christian and
   adopted Christianity as the State religion. Then it was that the "tree"
   grew and became strong in the earth, putting out its branches in all
   directions. But then it was, also, that the fowls of Satan found
   shelter within its imposing boughs. However, great as the tree has
   become, its end is sure. Just as we learnt in the previous parable that
   the tares shall yet be consigned to the fire, so shall this great
   "tree" yet be cut down and brought to nought.

   We turn now to the fourth parable of Matt. 13--the parable of the
   Leaven, the leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
   till the whole was leavened. This parable is one of the foundation
   passages of post-millennialists. In it they see clear proof that the
   Reign of Righteousness, the Golden Age, is to be brought about by the
   efforts of the Church. The woman, we are told, symbolizes the Church,
   the three measures of meal the human race, and the leaven the Gospel,
   which, working silently but surely shall yet permeate the whole of
   humanity and influence all men Godward and heavenward. But the
   assumption that the leaven here signifies the influence and power of
   the Gospel will not stand the test of the Scriptures, for in the Word
   of God "leaven" is uniformly employed as a figure of that which is
   evil. The Israelites in Egypt were commanded to put away all leaven
   from their houses on the night of the Passover, and to eat the lamb
   with un-leavened bread. Leaven was rigidly excluded from every one of
   the Levitical offerings which typified Christ. When our Lord was here
   upon earth He bade His disciples "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
   and of the Sadducees" (Matt. 16:11). Writing to the Corinthians the
   apostle exhorted them to "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye
   may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover
   is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old
   leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the
   unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (1 Cor. 5:7, 8). Thus we see
   that, in harmony with its nature, leaven, is uniformly used as a figure
   of evil. How strange then that sober expositions should ever have
   regarded sour dough--a form of incipient putrefaction--as a symbol of
   the unadulterated Word of God working in the hearts of men!

   What then is the meaning of the parable of the Leaven? We answer that
   just as the former one brings before us the external development of a
   corrupted Christianity, so this one shows us the internal working of
   corruption within the Christian profession. The third parable brings
   us, historically, to the time of Constantine; the fourth carries us
   forward to the time of the rise and growth of the Roman Catholic
   Church. The "woman" in our parable figures the "mother of harlots and
   abominations of the earth" (Rev. 17:5)--"that woman Jezebel, which
   calleth herself a prophetess' (Rev. 2:20). Her act in "hiding" the
   leaven comports well with the secrecy and stealth which has ever
   characterized the methods of the Roman hierarchy. The action of the
   woman is further evidence that the post-millennial interpretation of
   this parable is erroneous, for there is nothing secret about the
   proclamation and spread of the Gospel. Said our Lord to His disciples,
   "What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear
   in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops" (Matt. 10:27); and wrote
   the apostle, "But having renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
   walking in craftiness, not handling the Word of God deceitfully"(2 Cor.
   4:2). But both "craftiness" and "deceit" did mark this woman's action.
   She stealthily introduced into the meal a corrupting element, and
   though the resulting bread might be rendered more palatable,
   nevertheless it had been polluted. The three measures of meal stand for
   the whole of Christendom, and as Dr. Haldeman has pointed out, it is
   very remarkable that there are just three great divisions in
   Christendom, namely, the Roman Catholic, the Greek, and the Protestant
   Churches. And how true it is that these three divisions of the meal
   have each and all been thoroughly corrupted by the leaven introduced by
   the "woman"! Everywhere there are relics of Romanism, even in all the
   so-called Protestant churches.

   To say that this parable teaches that the Gospel is to win the whole
   world to Christ is to put light for darkness and is to make error equal
   truth. If the leaven represents the Gospel, the woman the church, and
   the meal the entire human race, then we have to confess that our Lord
   erred in His judgment and entirely over-estimated the power of the
   Gospel to find a response in the hearts of men, for after eighteen
   centuries of Gospel preaching we cannot point to a single country where
   all its subjects make even a profession of Christianity; nay, the world
   over, we cannot find a single city, town, or hamlet where everyone of
   its inhabitants is a believer in the Lord Jesus. No; this parable shows
   us the secret working of a putrefying element which spreads nought but
   corruption,--Can then the Millennium be introduced by the universal
   diffusion of a corrupted Christianity!

   In these four parables we discover the methods used by Satan to hinder
   the work of true Christianity. At the beginning he sought to oppose by
   catching away the Seed, which method was pursued throughout the first
   century when the Devil endeavored to exterminate and annihilate the
   Word of God by means of the sword and the bonfire. In the second
   parable we see him changing his tactics aiming to destroy Christianity
   by mingling his own children among the people of God. In the third we
   see how by a master-stroke of the Enemy the Christian profession was
   Paganized and as the result the world was won over by dazzling the eyes
   of men with a gorgeous ritual, with imposing architecture, and with the
   sanction and approval of the Roman Emperors themselves. In the fourth
   we discover how he succeeded in corrupting the doctrines and practices
   of Christianity by introducing into its midst a foreign and putrefying
   element which has resulted in the leavening of the entire mass.

   We shall not tarry long with the last three parables of this series.
   There is nothing at all in them, any more than in those already
   considered, which confirms and establishes the post-millennial
   teaching. A treasure buried in the field (which is "the world") can
   scarcely figure the universal success of the Gospel. A "pearl"--which
   is an object taken out of the "sea" (symbol of the nations) is no
   picture of a world won to Christ. While the Drag-net--the last of the
   series--enclosing as it does "every kind" of fish, the "bad" as well as
   the good, surely refutes the assertion that at the close of time Christ
   will return to find all men reconciled to Himself.

  3. Our Lord's Olivet discourse shows that there is no universal triumph of the
  Gospel before His Second Advent.

   The Olivet Discourse of our Lord is recorded in Matthew 24, Mark 13,
   and Luke 21. We cannot now attempt a detailed exposition of these
   highly interesting and important chapters, but would simply single our
   from them a few things which throw light upon our present inquiry. At
   the beginning of Matt. 24 we find that three of His disciples asked our
   Lord, "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign
   of Thy coming, and of the end of the age?" (vs. 3). What then was the
   answer which our Saviour returned to these questions? Did He reply
   saying that the Age would end with the universal triumph of the Gospel?
   Did He tell them that the Sign of His coming would be a converted world
   that would be eagerly awaiting His return to it? If so, this clearly
   decides the issue once for all, for there can be no appeal against the
   declarations of the One who was truth incarnate.

   As we read the verses which record our Lord's reply to the questions of
   His disciples we find that instead of Him painting a picture in bright
   and attractive colors, He portrayed a set of conditions which were
   pathetic and tragic in their bearing and nature. Instead of intimating
   that things on earth would improve during the time of His absence, He
   showed that they would get worse and worse. Instead of promising an era
   of peace and prosperity, He predicted a time of blood-shed and famine.
   Instead of telling the disciples that truth would be universally
   diffused and received, He forewarned them of the coming of false
   prophets who should deceive many. Instead of teaching that His
   followers would grow more zealous and faithful to Him, He announced
   that because iniquity should abound the love of many would "wax cold."
   Instead of saying that He should come back here to be received with an
   open-armed welcome, He predicted that on His return "all the tribes of
   the earth shall mourn." It is true that He said, "This Gospel of the
   Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
   nations," yet a little further down in the same chapter He very plainly
   intimated that it should meet with an almost universal rejection - "For
   as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man
   be," proves this.

   It is therefore well nigh impossible for us to imagine anything more
   directly opposed to the post-millennial theory than what we find here
   in this address of our Lord's. It would appear from His utterances as
   if He, with omniscient vision, foresaw the very teaching which is so
   common in our day and that He designedly and deliberately anticipated
   and repudiated it. In verses 29 and 30 of Matt. 24 we read,
   "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
   darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
   fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And
   then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall
   all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man
   coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." The
   "tribulation" here spoken of is described in verses 21 and 22 of this
   same chapter--"For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not
   since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
   And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be
   saved." How different this from the glowing pictures painted by the
   post-millennialists! That the things here mentioned cannot possibly
   have reference to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus is evident from
   the fact that "immediately after the tribulation" of those days the sun
   was not"darkened," the moon did not"cease to give her light," and the
   Son of Man was not seen "coming in the clouds of heaven." No; these
   verses describe conditions which are to prevail at "the end of the
   Age." Observe particularly that it is said, "Immediately after the
   tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened" etc., and that
   "then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the
   Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven." The conditions then which
   are to immediately precede the Second Advent of Christ are not those of
   Millennial blessedness but those of unparalleled tribulation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. The present working of the Mystery of Iniquity proves that there can be no
  Millennium before the Redeemer's Return.

   "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come
   except there come a falling away first, and that Man of Sin be
   revealed, the Son of Perdition" (2 Thess. 2:3). In the first Epistle to
   the Thessalonians the apostle makes mention of the Second Coming of
   Christ in every chapter, and in the first chapter of the second Epistle
   he recurs again to the same theme--"The Lord Jesus shall be revealed
   from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on
   them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
   Christ" (vss. 7, 8). Then, at the opening of chapter two in the Second
   Epistle he further says, "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto Him, that
   ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor
   by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at
   hand." Observe that here the apostle speaks of "The Day of Christ"
   which is different from "The Coming of Christ." The "day of Christ"
   signifies the Millennium and is used in contrast with "Man's day" (1
   Cor. 4:3, margin) which denominates the dispensation in which we are
   now living. Here then the apostle expressly states that "that day (the
   Day of Christ) shall not come except there come a falling away first,
   and that Man of Sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition."

   The "Man of Sin" is the Antichrist who at the very close of this Age
   will oppose and exalt himself "above all that is called God, or that is
   worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing
   himself that he is God" (2 Thess. 2:4). In the seventh verse of this
   same chapter the apostle tells us "For the mystery of iniquity doth
   already work: only He who now letteth (hindereth) will let (hinder),
   until He be taken out of the way." Notice that the "Mystery of
   Iniquity" was said to "work" referring to the action of the leaven
   which was corrupting the meal even in the apostle's own lifetime. That
   which has "hindered" the full development of the Mystery of Iniquity"
   and which now prevents the revelation of the Antichrist is the presence
   on earth of God the Holy Spirit. But He is to be "taken out of the
   way"--removed from the earth when the saints are raptured to heaven.
   Then will the Devil be allowed "free rein" and the Son of Perdition
   will be publicly manifested. In the days of Antichrist God will send
   men strong delusion, "that they should believe a lie; that they all
   might be damned," who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
   unrighteousness" (vs. 12). The career of the Antichrist will be cut
   short by the return of our Redeemer to the earth--"whom the Lord shall
   consume with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the
   brightness of His coming" (vs. 8). The "Mystery of Iniquity" then, will
   be brought to a conclusion only by the Return of Christ in judgment
   which is another proof that there can be no Millennium before the
   Second Coming of Christ.

   To sum up the teaching of 2 Thess. 1:6-2:12. The testimony of this
   passage is in perfect accord with the declarations of the Lord Jesus in
   Matthew 24. Instead of teaching that before Christ returns all men will
   be converted by the Gospel, it distinctly affirms that the Day of
   Christ (the Millennium shall not come "except there come a falling away
   first" (Greek "apostasy"). Instead of teaching that this Age will close
   by witnessing a universal turning unto the Truth it explicitly states
   that it will terminate with God giving up multitudes "that they should
   believe a lie." Instead of teaching that this Dispensation will end
   with Christ exalted in the hearts of all, it declares that it will
   close with the manifestation and exaltation of the Antichrist and with
   the Lord coming back in judgment to destroy the Wicked One and to take
   vengeance on those that know not God and have scorned the Gospel of His
   Son.

IV. PRE-MILLENNIALISM ESTABLISHED.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. Christ does not "receive the Kingdom" until the time of His Second Advent.

   We must quote once more a passage that has already engaged our
   attention in another connection, namely, the Parable of the Nobleman.
   Before quoting from it, however, we would first observe that this
   parable was uttered by our Lord in order to correct a mistaken notion
   that was being entertained by certain of His auditors: "And as they
   heard these things, He added and spake a parable, because He was nigh
   to Jerusalem, and because they thought the kingdom of God should
   immediately appear" (Luke 19:11). Here is further proof that the
   "Kingdom," referred to subsequently by our Lord was not a spiritual
   Kingdom instituted by Him just after His death and resurrection, but
   was a Kingdom which was not to "appear" for a considerable length of
   time, in fact not until He returned again to the earth. To quote once
   more from this parable--

   "He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to
   receive for Himself a Kingdom and to return. ** And it came to pass,
   that when He was returned having received the Kingdom, then He
   commanded these servants to be called unto Him, to whom He had given
   the money, that He might know how much every man had gained by trading"
   (Luke 19:12, 15). Thus we see that our Lord's receiving of the Kingdom
   and His return synchronize. The Kingdom to which was the subject of
   numerous Old Testament prophecies. It was the "Kingdom" mentioned by
   Daniel in 7:13, 14 of his prophecy--"And I saw in the night visions,
   and, behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven,
   and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near before Him.
   And there was given Him(compare "received" in the above parable)
   dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,that all peoples, nations, and
   languages, should serve Him." As the context here shows, the time when
   the Son of Man is "given" this Kingdom is immediately following the
   destruction of t he Gentile powers which from the Book of Revelation,
   we know will occur just prior to the Millennium. If further proof be
   needed that Christ's "receiving of the Kingdom" takes place before and
   not after the Millennium it is furnished by 1 Cor. 15:24 where we are
   told that at the close of the Millennium--which is the time when He
   shall have "put down all rule and all authority and power"--He shall
   deliver "up the Kingdom to God, even the Father." If then Christ
   "delivers up" the Kingdom to the Father at the close of the Millennium
   then the conclusion is irresistible that He "receives" the Kingdom at
   the beginning of the Millennium.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The "Times of Restitution" can be ushered in only by the Second Advent of
  Christ.

   "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
   out, when the Times of Refreshing shall come from the presence of the
   Lord; And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
   you: Whom the heaven must receive until the Times of Restitution of all
   things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets
   since the world began" (Acts 3:19-21). The "Times of Restitution" here
   promised to Israel on the condition of their national repentance is one
   of the names of the Millennium itself. It is termed thus because at
   that time Israel shall be restored to favor with God again. It is
   termed thus because at that time Palestine shall be restored, restored
   to its original fertility, when it shall again be "a land that floweth
   with milk and honey." It is termed thus because at that time the animal
   creation shall be restored, restored to Edenic conditions, when once
   again "the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb." It is termed thus
   because at that time Creation shall be restored and delivered from its
   present bondage of corruption, restored to its original freedom and
   glory.

   The "Times of Restitution" is defined in the very passage where this
   expression occurs, defined in the previous words "the Times of
   Refreshing" which shall come from the presence of the Lord." Note
   particularly that these "Times of Restitution" cannot come until Christ
   Himself comes back again. This is expressly affirmed in the words "Whom
   the heaven must receive until." Observe it does not say "Whom the
   heaven must receive or retain during the Times of Restitution," still
   less "until the end of the Times of Restitution"--which it most
   certainly would say were the teaching of post-millennialism true--but
   "until the Times of Restitution," that is, until those times arrive.
   When these "Times" come then shall the Lord arrive. When these "Times"
   come then shall the Lord return, and when He returns then shall come
   "Times of Refreshment" for His people on earth.

   Observe, further, that we are told, these "Times of Restitution" were
   spoken of by all God's holy prophets. Of what "Times of Restitution"
   then did the Old Testament prophets speak? We answer, of Millennial
   "Times," when all nations of the earth shall be brought beneath the
   sway of Messiah's scepter. The Old Testament prophets uniformly connect
   the Times of "Restitution" with the Coming of Christ to the earth and
   they certainly knew of no Kingdom being brought in by the efforts of
   the Church. The able declaration of Peter then proves two things:
   First, that until the Times of Restitution the Heaven must retain our
   Lord; second, that as soon as these "Times" arrive, Christ shall
   assuredly return. Hence, there can be no Millennium until Christ comes
   back again to the earth, but as soon as He does come back again the
   Millennium will be inaugurated.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. The Restoration of Israel is only made possible by the Second Advent of
  Christ.

   Under this head we shall seek to prove briefly three things--that
   Israel as a nation will be restored, that Israel's restoration occurs
   at the Return of Christ, that Israel's restoration will result in great
   blessing to the whole world.

   That Israel as a nation will be actually and literally restored is
   declared again and again in the Word of God. We quote now but two
   prophecies from among scores of similar ones:--"Behold, the days come,
   saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a
   King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in
   the earth. In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell
   safely: and this is His name whereby He shall be called, The Lord our
   righteousness. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that
   they shall no more say, The Lord liveth which brought up the children
   of Israel out of the land of Egypt; But, The Lord liveth, which brought
   up and which led the seed of the House of Israel out of the north
   country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they
   shall dwell in their own land"(Jer. 23:5-8). Again; "Thus saith the
   Lord God; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the
   heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and
   bring them into their own land: And I will make them one nation in the
   land upon the mountains of Israel; and one King shall be King to them
   all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be
   divided into two kingdoms any more at all: Neither shall they defile
   themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things,
   nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all
   their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them:
   so shall they be My people, and I will be their God. And David My
   Servant shall be King over them; and they all shall have one shepherd:
   they shall also walk in My judgments, and observe My statutes, and do
   them. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob My
   servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein,
   even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever:
   and My Servant David shall be their prince for ever. Moreover I will
   make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant
   with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set My
   sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. My tabernacle also shall
   be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
   And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when My
   sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore" (Ezek. 37:21-28).

   That Israel's restoration synchronized with our Lord's Return to the
   earth may be seen from the following Scriptures:--"And it shall be said
   in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him; and He will
   save us: This is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and
   rejoice in His salvation" (Isaiah 25:9 and read on to the end of the
   following chapter). See further the whole of Isaiah 60 which follows
   the opening verse--"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory
   of the Lord is risen upon them." In Acts 3 we learned that Peter
   declared to Israel that if they would "Repent and be converted" that
   God would "send Jesus Christ unto them" and that following Christ's
   Return there would be the "Times of Restitution," even the Times of
   Refreshing which should "come from the presence of the Lord" (Acts
   3:19-21). In Acts 15:16 we read, "After this, I will return and will
   build again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down." And in Rom.
   11:25, 26 we are told, "Blindness in part is happened to Israel, until
   the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be
   saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer,
   and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob."

   That Israel's restoration results in great blessing to the whole world
   may be seen from the following quotations--"And the remnant of Jacob
   shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord, as the
   showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the
   sons of men" (Micah 5:7). "Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the
   face of the world with fruit"(Is. 27:6). While in Romans 11 we are told
   that the restoration of Israel will bring even greater blessing to the
   world than did their casting away--"If the fall of them (Israel) be the
   riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the
   Gentiles; how much more their fullness! If the casting away of them be
   the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but
   life from the dead!"(Rom. 11:11, 15).
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. A groaning Creation can be delivered only by the Second Advent of Christ.

   The difference in belief between post and pre-millennialists concerning
   this point is as great as the difference between light and darkness.
   Post-millennialists believe that Christ will not return until the end
   of time and that then He will come to judge the human race. As to what
   is going to happen at the end of time Scripture does not leave us in
   ignorance. Says the apostle Peter, "But the day of the Lord will come
   as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with
   a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth
   also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up" (2 Pet. 3:10).
   Post-millennialists then look for the world (the Kosmos) to be "burned
   up" and for "the heavens" to "pass away" at the time of Christ's
   Return; in other words, they look for the destruction of the old
   creation as the consequent of the Second Advent. But pre-millennialists
   look for the emancipation of all creation from its present bondage as
   one of the glorious results of our Redeemer's Return. They base this
   belief on the teaching of Rom. 8:18-24, a passage which has already
   been examined in an earlier chapter. Without again entering upon a
   detailed exposition of the entire passage, let us seek to summarize its
   contents.

   "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now"
   (vs. 22). This is the lot of all Nature to-day. The world groans
   beneath an accumulating load of sin and wretchedness. Man groans: his
   soul groans, and so does his body. Animals groan. The earth itself
   groans, sometimes like a great giant in awful pain. How then can the
   world enjoy a thousand years of rest and peace and blessedness whilst
   the whole creation is in travail! The whole creation is here
   personified and represented as sending up to heaven a loud and
   agonizing groan. And God in heaven hears it: His ear is not heavy that
   it cannot hear, nor is His arm shortened that it cannot save. A day of
   liberation for the groaning creation hastens on. It is announced in the
   very passage we are now reviewing. The day when this groaning creation
   will be delivered is the day when Christ returns to usher in the
   Millennium and when the saints shall be revealed in glory with Him. The
   time of creation's deliverance is here said to be at "the manifestation
   of the sons of God" (vs. 19 and compare Col. 3:3). This manifestation
   of God's sons is in verse 23 denominated "The Adoption, to wit, the
   redemption of our body" which has reference to the "first
   resurrection"--the "resurrection of the just." A groaning creation then
   is waiting for the Return of Christ and with Him the Saints manifested
   in glory, for then, and not till then, will it be emancipated from its
   present thraldom.

   Here then is the answer to our question--What is the time of the
   Redeemer's Return? He shall return before the Millennium. He shall come
   back to usher in the Millennium and set up His Messianic Kingdom,
   restore Israel, and deliver a groaning creation. As to how near His
   pre-millennial coming may be we leave for consideration in the next two
   chapters.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  Chapter Five

                     The Imminency of the Redeemer's Return


   "For yet a little while, and He that shall come

   will come, and will not tarry" (Heb. 10:37).

   In the previous chapter we sought to do nothing more than prove that
   our Redeemer would return before the Millennium, the date of His
   return, either the approximate or the precise date, we did not touch
   upon. Nowhere in the Bible is the actual time of the Second Advent made
   known, instead, it is presented as an event which may occur at any
   hour; or, in other words, the Fact of the Saviour's appearing is
   invariably set forth in the language of Imminency. When we say that the
   Redeemer's Return is an imminent event, we do not mean it will occur
   immediately, but that He may come back in our own lifetime, that He may
   come back this year; yet, we cannot say that He will do so. The Fact of
   the Second Advent is certain because expressly revealed in Holy Writ;
   the Date of the Second Advent is uncertain because it has not been made
   known by God. Here then we have a truth, which is simple to grasp, yet
   one which is of fundamental importance and great practical value. The
   majority of the errors and heresies which have gathered around this
   subject are directly traceable to the ignoring of this elementary
   consideration. For example: if the Lord's people had given due heed to
   the fact that Scripture presents the Second Coming of Christ as
   something which may happen at any hour, then the post-millennial
   teaching that our Lord will not come back again for more than a
   thousand years, would never have obtained the hearing and acceptance
   which it has received. Furthermore; if the wondrous truth that our
   Redeemer might return today once took firm hold on our hearts, it would
   revolutionize our lives and provide us with a spiritual dynamic which
   is incalculable in its reach and incomparable in its value. Without
   expatiating any further upon the general bearings of this aspect of our
   theme, let us not proceed to show that--
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. Our Lord Himself spoke of His Return in the language of Imminency.

   In the Olivet discourse, where the Master replied to the inquires of
   His disciples concerning the Sign of His Coming and of the End of the
   Age, He said--"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord
   doth come. But know this, that if the good man of the house had known
   in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would
   not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also
   ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh. Who
   then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over
   His household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that
   servant, whom his Lord when He cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say
   unto you, That He shall make him ruler over all His goods. But and if
   that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth His coming;
   and shall begin to smite his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with
   the drunken; the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he
   looketh not for Him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, And shall
   cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there
   shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 24:42-51). [8]

   An analysis of the above passage reveals the following important
   truths. First; the "hour" of our Lord's Return is unknown to His
   people. Second; because we know not the exact time of His appearing, we
   must be in an attitude of constant expectation and watchfulness. Third;
   the Lord will return unexpectedly, even in such an hour as His own
   people "think not." Fourth; the faithful and wise servant is he who
   shall give meat in due season to those of the Lord's household during
   the time of Christ's absence, and the one who is found so occupied at
   the time of His appearing shall be richly rewarded. Fifth; the one who
   shall say in his heart "My Lord delayeth His coming" is an "evil
   servant," and such an one shall receive a portion of shame and
   suffering at our Lord's Return.

   The Parable of the Ten Virgins intimates that the Lord Jesus desired
   His people to maintain an attitude of constant readiness for the
   appearing of the Bridegroom. At the beginning of the parable He
   pictures all of the "virgins" taking their lamps and going forth to
   "meet" Him. The interpretation of this part of the parable is very
   simple. In the early days after our Lord's departure from the earth,
   His followers detached themselves from all worldly interests and set
   their affections on Christ--His return being their one hope and great
   desire. But while the Bridegroom tarried the expectation of His
   appearing disappeared, and spiritual sloth and sleep was the inevitable
   consequence, and this condition prevailed until the midnight cry
   arose--"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him." The
   effect of this cry is seen in the arousing of both the wise and the
   foolish virgins. The need of preparation and watchfulness is disclosed
   in the doom that overtook those who had no oil in their vessels. The
   practical application of the whole parable was made by the Lord
   Himself--"Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
   wherein the Son of Man cometh." (Matt. 25:13).

   At the close of St. Mark's account of the Olivet discourse he records
   at greater length than does St. Matthew our Lord's command to His
   disciples to watch for His return--"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for
   ye know not when the time is. For the Son of Man is as a man taking a
   far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants,
   and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye
   therefore: for ye know not when the Master of the house cometh, at
   even, or at midnight, or at the cock crowing, or in the morning: Lest
   coming suddenly He find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say
   unto all, Watch" (Mark 13:33-37). A careful reading of these verses
   makes it apparent that the design of the Master was to impress upon His
   disciples two things: first, that while it was certain He would return,
   yet it was uncertain when He would appear; second, that in view of the
   uncertainty of the exact hour of His second coming the Lord's followers
   must maintain an attitude of constant watchfulness, looking for Him to
   return at any moment.

   On another occasion the Lord said to His disciples, "Let your loins be
   girded about, and your lights burning: and ye yourselves like unto men
   that wait for their Lord, when He will return from the wedding: that
   when He cometh and knocketh, they may open unto Him immediately.
   Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh shall find
   watching: verily I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make
   them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. And if He
   shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find
   them so, blessed are those servants" (Luke 12:35-38). The comparison is
   a very impressive one. The believer is exhorted to be like a faithful
   servant, standing on the threshold with loins girded and his lamp
   lighted, peering through the darkness for the first sign of his
   returning Master and listening eagerly with attentive ear for the first
   sounds of His approaching steps.

   "For even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
   In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the
   house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the
   field, let him likewise not return back. ** I tell you in that night
   there shall be two men in one bed: the one shall be taken, and the
   other shall be left. Two women shall be girding together: the one shall
   be taken and the other left" (Luke 17:30-35). The force of this passage
   is in full harmony with the others already considered. The Lord's
   appearing is to be unannounced and unexpected. It will occur while men
   are busy at their daily vocations, and therefore it behooves us to be
   constantly on the qui vive. In passing, we may observe how the last
   quoted Scripture brings out the marvelous scientific accuracy of the
   Bible. We are told in verse 31 above, that it shall be "day" (in
   another part of the earth), thus anticipating a comparatively recent
   discovery of science and demonstrating that the Lord Jesus was
   perfectly cognizant of the rotundity and rotation of the earth!

   "And take heed to yourselves, least at any time your hearts be
   overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,
   and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on
   all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore,
   and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these
   things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man"
   (Luke 21:34-36). Mark particularly, above, the words "lest at any time
   your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting (self-indulgence) ** and so
   that day come upon you unawares." Daily, nay, hourly, readiness is
   required of us. Language could not be more explicit. Let those who
   speak so disparagingly of the "any moment theory" weigh the words "at
   any time" and remember they were uttered by the Lord Himself. The
   precise Date of the Second Advent has been designedly withheld from us
   in order that we should maintain our attitude of watchfulness and that
   we remain on the very tiptoe of expectation.

   Just here we must take note of an objection that is brought against the
   position we are now advocating, namely, In view of the fact that in the
   above quotations it is clear that our Lord taught His disciples to look
   for His Return in their own lifetime, how can we harmonize this with
   His teaching in Matthew 13 where we found He foretold that certain
   conditions must arise before the end of this age could arrive? How can
   we square the presentation of the Redeemer's Return in the language of
   imminency with the predictions that before He came back the little
   mustard-seed must grow into a great tree and the whole of the three
   measures of meal be completely leavened? At first sight this appears a
   real difficulty, but further reflection will show it is more apparent
   than actual.

   When we examine the parables of Matthew 13 in the presence of the above
   objection our first question must be, What impression were these
   parables calculated to make upon the minds of the apostles, or on
   Christians in apostolic days? That these parables contain prophetic
   pictures which it has taken many centuries to fully develop is evident
   to intelligent believers living now, but we insist that these
   predictions were couched in such terms that there was nothing in their
   surface and obvious signification which forbade the apostles and their
   converts looking for the Redeemer to return in their own lifetime. In
   other words, there was nothing direct in these parables which argued
   the inevitable postponement of the Second Advent until a long interval
   of time had elapsed after they were uttered by the Lord Jesus. In our
   exposition of Matthew 13 (see the previous chapter) we showed how, very
   early in the apostolic era, these parables began to receive their
   fulfillment, and, as we would now point out, they were fulfilled to
   such an extent that as a matter of fact they presented no necessary
   obstacles to the first century saints who believed in the Imminent
   appearing of the Saviour.

   The first parable need not here detain us, for, the Sowing of the Seed
   was done by Christ Himself while He was here in person on the earth.
   Concerning the parable of the Tares it is sufficient to say that within
   the lifetime of the apostles themselves, long before the end of the
   first century was reached, Satan had succeeded in covertly introducing
   his children among the people of God. It is true the parable teaches
   that the wheat and the tares were to grow together until the harvest
   and that the harvest would not be until the end of the age, but there
   is nothing in the parable which intimated that a protracted interval
   lay between the sowing and the harvest, nay, there was nothing in it
   which discouraged the belief that the crop might hasten rapidly and the
   harvest occur in the lifetime of the apostles themselves.

   The third parable foretold that the little mustard-seed was to become a
   great tree and, as we say, it was the growth of Christianity
   (previously corrupted) which was thus symbolized. But let it be
   carefully noted that nothing at all was said in the parable as to how
   great the "tree" was to become. Furthermore, we know that even in the
   days of the apostles Christianity had made marvelous progress and had
   spread through extensive regions. At the time our Lord uttered the
   parable His followers were but a mere handful and there is nothing to
   indicate that up to the hour of His ascension His flock was anything
   more than a "little" one. But contrast the conditions that we read of
   in the Book of Acts. Mark the three thousand which were converted on
   the day of Pentecost. Take note of such expressions as, "And believers
   were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women"
   (Acts 5:14); "Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and
   preached Christ unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed
   unto those things which Philip spake ** when they believed Philip
   preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of
   Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women" (8:5, 6, 12);
   "And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were
   come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus, And
   the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and
   turned unto the Lord. Then tidings of these things came unto the ears
   of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas,
   that he should go as far as Antioch. Who, when he came, and had seen
   the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of
   heart they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full
   of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the
   Lord"(11:20-24). Take into consideration the churches which were
   planted in Galatia, Corinth, Thessalonia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colosse,
   Babylon (1 Pet. 5:13), Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis,
   Philadelphia, Laodicea, and then it will be seen that the predicted
   growth of the mustard-seed could present no obstacle to the disciples'
   continual expectancy of Christ's appearing. And, if it be further
   objected that our parable foretold the corruption as well as the growth
   of Christianity, the answer is that the apostolic Epistles record the
   fulfillment of this part of the parable too. Read such passages as
   Phil. 3:18, 19, where the apostle says, "For many walk, of whom I have
   told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the
   enemies of the Cross of Christ; whose end is destruction, whose God is
   their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly
   things;" (2 Thess. 2:7) and from such Scriptures we may discover how
   extensively the meal had been "leavened" in that early day. Thus the
   parables of the mustard-seed and the Leaven had been so far fulfilled
   in the lifetime of the apostles themselves that none could say the end
   of the age might not even then be near at hand.

   One other Scripture needs to be noted in this connection ere we turn to
   our next point. It has often been objected by post-millennialists that
   in view of our Lord's declaration "This gospel of the kingdom shall be
   preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then
   shall the end come" (Matt. 24:14), that it was impossible for the
   apostles to be expecting Christ to return in their own lifetime. But
   this objection is disposed of by several passages recorded in the New
   Testament itself. In Acts 19:10 we read, "And this continued by the
   space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word
   of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks." And again, in Col. 1:5, 6 we
   are told, "For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye
   heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel: which is come unto
   you, as it is in all the world" and in verse 23 of the same chapter "be
   not moved away from the hope of the Gospel, which ye have heard, and
   which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I
   Paul am made a minister." From these passages then it is abundantly
   clear that no such formidable hindrance as imagined by
   post-millennialists interposed between the apostles and the hope of the
   imminent return of the Redeemer. Scripture thus affords positive
   evidence that the Gospel had been so widely diffused by the apostles
   themselves that nothing further necessarily and inevitably intervened
   between them and the realization of their hope.

   Having thus, we trust, satisfactorily, disposed of the most plausible
   and forcible objection which can be brought against the pre-millennial
   and imminent Return of our Lord, let us now consider.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] The above Scripture refers primarily to our Lord's Return to the
   earth, as is evident from the fact that He here styles Himself "The Son
   of Man;" yet, like all prophecy it has at least a double bearing and
   therefore may properly be applied to His secret Coming to the air.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The Apostles referred to the Redeemer's Return in the language of
  Imminency.

   "Knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for
   now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far
   spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of
   darkness, and let us put on the armour of light" (Rom. 13:11, 12). The
   "salvation," to which the apostle here refers is the completing and
   consummating of our salvation, when we shall, in spirit and soul and
   body, be fully conformed to the image of God's Son. The time when this
   will be realized is the time of our Redeemer's Return, for, "when He
   shall appear we shall be like Him"(1 John 3:2). That time will be the
   believer's "day," that "perfect day" unto which the path of the just
   "shineth more and more" (Prov. 4:18). The "night," spoken of above, is
   the present period during which the Light of the world is absent.
   Observe that the apostle, under the Holy Spirit, regarded the night as
   "far spent," and the day as "at hand!"

   "And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly"(Rom.
   16:20). The reference here is to Gen. 3:15 where we have recorded
   Jehovah's promise to our first parents that the woman's Seed should
   bruise the head of the Serpent. As believers will, in the coming day,
   rule and reign "with Christ" (see Rev. 3:21; 19:14, 20:4) it is here
   said "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet." In the use
   of the word "shortly" we learn that the apostle did not regard the
   fulfillment of this promise as something which lay in the far distant
   future, but rather as that which was even then impending.

   "I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is
   given you by Jesus Christ; That in everything ye are enriched by Him,
   in all utterance, and in all knowledge, even as the testimony of Christ
   was confirmed in you; So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for
   the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ"(1 Cor. 1:4-7). From this passage
   we learn: first, that these Corinthian saints were "waiting" for the
   Coming of the Lord Jesus, which proves they were looking for Him to
   return in their generation; second, that the apostle commanded them for
   their attitude, yea, "thanked God always on their behalf;" third, that
   this expectation on the part of these Corinthian believers was the very
   summum bonum of Christian experience, inasmuch as it is said, they
   "came behind in no gift," and then as a climax it is added--"Waiting
   for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   "Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
   Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
   some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the
   Day approaching"(Heb. 10:24, 25). The coming "Day" with its glories and
   blessedness was that which filled the apostle's vision. The promised
   "Day"--the Day of Christ--which was to follow this dark night of sorrow
   when the Bridegroom is absent, was the hope which stayed his heart. He
   could "see," by faith, that day was approaching, and on the fact of its
   imminency he bases an exhortation to those who are partakers of the
   heavenly calling to conduct themselves in the present in a manner
   befitting those who are the children of light. Again, in this same
   chapter the apostle says, For yet a little while, and He that shall
   come will come, and will not tarry" (vs. 37). How clear it is from
   these words that the Holy Spirit desired the first century believers to
   be "looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the
   great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ"!

   So real was the hope of the Redeemer's Return to the heart of the
   apostle Paul and so imminent did this event appear to him that we find
   he included himself among those who might not fall asleep but be among
   the living saints when the Assembling Shout should be heard. Said he,
   "Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
   be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye" (1 Cor. 15:51, 52).
   Again, "For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we look for
   the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our(not "your")
   vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body" (Phil.
   3:19, 20). Once more, "For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven
   with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of
   God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we(not "ye") which
   are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
   clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
   Lord" (1 Thess. 4:16, 17). The enemies of the faith have seized upon
   these very statements to show that the apostle Paul was in error, that
   he wrote by unaided human wisdom, that he merely recorded in his
   Epistles his own beliefs, and that in some of these he was clearly
   mistaken. But such an objection is quite pointless to the saints who
   believe that "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God." We hope to
   show further on in this chapter why the Holy Spirit moved the apostles
   to write of the Second Advent of Christ as an event which might take
   place in their own day.

   The apostle Paul was not alone in this regard: we find that the other
   apostles also regarded the Return of our Lord as something which might
   occur at any time. The apostle James wrote, "Be ye also patient;
   stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh"(Jas.
   5:8). There is no ambiguity about this language: such a statement not
   only argued the pre-millennial Coming of Christ, inasmuch as His Coming
   could not be said to have "drawn nigh" if a whole Millennium
   intervened, but it also announced the imminency of His
   return--something which might be expected at any time. The apostle
   Peter declared, "But the end of all things (all things connected with
   this present regime) is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto
   prayer" (1 Pet. 4:7). The apostle was expecting the speedy winding up
   of this present economy and the introduction of a new order of things
   when his Lord returned and took the government upon His shoulder. The
   apostle John said, "Little children it is the last time: and as ye have
   heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists;
   whereby we know that it is the last time" (1 John 2:18). The "last
   time" or "last hour" (Greek hora) must be distinguished from "the last
   days" (2 Tim. 3:1) and "the last day" (Greek hemera--John 6:39). The
   "last days" refer to the closing decades of this present dispensation.
   The "last day" looks forward to the Millennium when the saints shall
   participate in the "first resurrection"--it is the last Day of God's
   dispensational week, foreshadowed by the Sabbath. The "last hour" is
   connected with the Antichrist. It is the "last hour" of Satan's freedom
   for, excepting the "little season" referred to in Rev. 20, after this
   dispensation Satan will be for ever banished from these scenes. This
   dispensation then is Satan's "last hour" as the "Prince of this world"
   and it is during the closing moments of this "last hour" that the
   Antichrist shall be revealed. The force then of the apostle's statement
   was to the effect that though the personal Antichrist had not appeared
   up to the time when he wrote this epistle, yet, the saints must not
   conclude from this that the Second Coming of Christ was necessarily a
   long way off. No; even then there were many Antichrists by which they
   were to know it was the "last time." Thus we see that the testimony of
   the apostles was uniform and explicit. They were looking for their Lord
   to return at any time. Such ought to be our attitude too.


   "Let not my eyes with tears be dim,

   Let joy their upward glance illume;

   Look up, and watch, and wait for Him--

   Soon, soon the Lord will come.

   Soon will that star-paved milky way,

   Soon will that beauteous azure dome,

   Glories, ne'er yet conceived display--

   Soon, soon the Lord will come.

   Changed in the twinkling of an eye,

   Invested with immortal bloom,

   I shall behold Him throned on high,

   And sing, "The Lord is come!"

   One beam from His all-glorious face

   These mortal garments will consume,

   Each sinful blemish will efface--

   Lord Jesus, quickly come!

   What will it be with Thee to dwell,

   Thyself my everlasting Home!

   Oh, bliss- Oh, joy ineffable!

   Lord Jesus, quickly come!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. Why was the fact of our Lord's Return presented in the language of
  Imminency and the exact date withheld?

   At first sight it may appear strange that our Lord has not made known
   to us the precise date of His appearing. He has caused many details
   concerning the Blessed Hope to be recorded in the Word. He has made
   known many things which are to transpire at His second advent, and in
   view of the fact that so much has been revealed it may strike us as
   peculiar that the very point upon which human curiosity most desires
   enlightenment should have been left undefined. We need hardly say that
   it was not ignorance on our Lord's part which caused Him to leave the
   hour of His second coming un-determined, though some of His enemies
   have dared to charge this against Him, basing their evil indictment
   upon Mark 13:32--"But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not
   the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father." These
   words need occasion no difficulty if we pay due attention to the
   particular Gospel in which they are found, namely, Mark's- the Gospel
   of the Servant of Jehovah. The purpose of Mark's Gospel is to present
   the Lord Jesus as the perfect Servant, the obedient Servant, the
   Servant whose meat it was to do the will of Him that sent Him, and "the
   servant knoweth not what his lord doeth" (John 15:15). Mark 13:32 does
   not call into question our Lord's omniscience but asserts that, as a
   Servant, He waited Another's will. A little reflection will reveal the
   perfect wisdom of our Lord in concealing the exact date of His Return.
   One reason was that He desired to keep His people on the very tiptoe of
   expectation, continually looking for Him.

   Again; this question needs to be pondered in the light of the Unity of
   Christ's church. The tendency with all of us is to regard believers as
   so many detached individuals, instead of viewing the saints as "one
   body" (1 Cor. 12:13) "members one of another" (Rom. 12:5). The church
   is not an organization, it is a living organism, a "body" of which
   Christ is the "head." Hence, the Imminency of the Redeemer's return is
   to one member precisely what it is to all the members. and therefore it
   is that first century believers were just as truly and just as much
   interested in the appearing of the Saviour as are believers now living
   in the twentieth century. The object of hope then is the object of hope
   now, for the Body is one, and conversely, the object of hope now must
   necessarily have been the object of hope then. Consequently, the early
   Christians, by virtue of the Unity of the saints, were exhorted to walk
   in the light and blessing of a hope which is common to the entire
   church.

   The Return of our Lord might not have been revealed at all, but in that
   case a most powerful dynamic to godly living would have been withheld
   from the church. The Imminency of the Redeemer's second advent was
   revealed as an incentive to watchfulness and preparedness. If then the
   fact of our Lord's return had not been presented in the New Testament
   as something which might occur at any time, but, instead, had been
   expressly postponed and fixed to happen in some particular and distant
   century, then all believers who lived in the centuries preceding that
   one would have been robbed of the comfort which is to be found in the
   assurance that Christ may return at any hour and would have lost the
   purifying effects which such a prospect is calculated to produce. As it
   has been well remarked, "It is not that He desires each succeeding
   generation to believe that He will certainly return in their time, for
   He does not desire our faith and our practice to be founded on an
   error, as, in that case, the faith and practice of all generations
   except the last would be. But it is a necessary element of the doctrine
   concerning the second coming of Christ, that it should be possible at
   any time, that no generation should consider it improbable in theirs"
   (Archbishop Trench).

   Here then is the simple but sufficient answer to our question. The
   second coming of Christ is presented in the language of imminency
   because of the far-reaching effects it is designed to exert on those
   who lay hold of the promise, "Surely I come quickly." The imminent
   return of the Redeemer is a practical hope. It is the commanding motive
   of the New Testament. The Holy Spirit has linked it with every precept
   and practice of Christian character and conduct. As another has so well
   expressed it: "It arms admonitions, it points appeals, it strengthens
   arguments, it enforces commands, it intensifies entreaties, it arouses
   courage, it rebukes fear, it quickens affection, it kindles hope, it
   inflames zeal, it separates from the world, it consecrates to God, it
   drys tears, it conquers death" (Brookes). To amplify this statement in
   detail--

   The hope of our Lord's second advent produces loyalty and faithfulness
   to Christ."Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his Lord
   shall make ruler over His household, to give them their portion of meat
   in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when He cometh
   shall find so doing. Of a truth, I say unto you, that He will make him
   ruler over all that He hath. But and if that servant say in his heart,
   My Lord delayeth His coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants
   and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; The Lord of that
   Servant will come in a day when he looketh not for Him, and at an hour
   when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him
   his portion with the unbelievers" (Luke 12:42-46). The moral purpose of
   this parable (see context of above quotation) is apparent. While the
   steward maintained an attitude of watchfulness he was faithful and
   sober, but when he said in his heart "my Lord delayeth His coming" he
   began to beat his fellow-servants and to eat and drink and be drunken.
   Watching for the Lord then is an incentive to loyalty and fidelity,
   while unwatchfulness results in worldliness of heart, carelessness of
   walk and carnality of life.

   The Return of our Lord is presented as a motive to brotherly love- "And
   the Lord made you to increase and abound in love one toward another,
   and toward all men, even as we do toward you: To the end He may
   stablish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our
   Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints" (1
   Thess. 3:12, 13). In view of the fact that our Lord may return at any
   hour, how awful are divisions between the Lord's own people. Soon shall
   each of us appear before the Bema of Christ where every wrong will be
   righted and every misunderstanding cleared up. The Lord is at hand,
   therefore let us sink our petty differences, forgive one another even
   as God hath for Christ's sake forgiven us, and increase and abound in
   love one toward another.

   The perennial hope of Christ's second advent is used as a call to a
   godly walk- "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
   to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
   should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.
   Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" (Titus 2:11-13). How clear it is from
   these words that the Blessed Hope is intended to check the spirit of
   self-pleasing and self-seeking in the believer and to promote holiness
   in the daily life. As says the apostle John, "He that hath this hope in
   Him purifieth himself even as He is pure" (1 John 3:3).

   The return of our Lord is designed to comfort bereaved hearts--"For I
   would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
   asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if
   we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which
   sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say unto you by the
   word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of
   the Lord shall not prevent (go before) them which are asleep. For the
   Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
   the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall
   rise first: Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with
   these words"(1 Thess. 4:13-18). Those to whom the apostle was writing
   were sorrowing over the loss of loved ones. But observe, he does not
   seek to solace by telling them that shortly they would die and join the
   departed in heaven. No; he held up before them the prospect of a
   returning Saviour who would bring back the sleeping saints with Him.

   The promise of the Redeemer's return is calculated to develop the grace
   of patience--"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the
   Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
   earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and
   the latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the
   coming of the Lord draweth nigh" (Jas. 5:7, 8). These words were
   addressed to saints who were poor in this world's goods and who were
   groaning beneath the oppression of unrighteous employers. How timely is
   this word of exhortation to many a twentieth-century saint! How many of
   God's poor are now crying unto the Lord for deliverance from pecuniary
   difficulties, from tyranny and injustice! These cries have reached the
   ears of the Lord of hosts, and just as He intervened of old on behalf
   of Israel in Egypt, so will He speedily come and remove His people from
   their present cruel task-masters. In the meantime, the word is, "Be
   patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord."

   The hope of our Lord's return is the antidote for worry- "Let your
   forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand, In nothing be
   anxious"(Phil. 4:5, 6, R.V.). Brethren in Christ, why be so fearful
   about meeting next year's liabilities? Why be anxiously scheming and
   fretting about the future? Why be worrying about the morrow? Tomorrow
   you may be in heaven. Before tomorrow dawns the assembling Shout may be
   given. At any hour thy Saviour may come.The Lord is at hand and His
   appearing will mean the end of all your trials and troubles. Look not
   then at your dangers and difficulties, but for your Redeemer. In
   nothing be anxious.

   The prospect of a speedily returning Saviour is employed to stimulate
   sobriety and vigilance- "Knowing the time, that now it is high time to
   awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we
   believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
   cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of
   light"(Rom. 13:11, 12). As we have shown in a previous chapter the
   "salvation" here spoken of is that mentioned in Heb. 9:28 ("unto them
   that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto
   salvation") which salvation is brought to us at Christ's second advent.
   Note, particularly, that this salvation is not presented as a distant
   hope, to be realized at some remote period, but is set forth as that
   which is nigh at hand.

   Ere closing this chapter one other question claims our attention--
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. Why is it that our Lord has tarried till now? Why has not the Redeemer
  returned long ere this?

   At first sight perhaps this inquiry might appear almost irreverent and
   some may feel inclined to remind us that "secret things belong unto the
   Lord." In response we would say, It is not in any spirit of idle
   curiosity nor is it to indulge an inquisitive speculation that we take
   up this question, but simply because we believe that a humble
   examination of it will prove profitable to our souls, inasmuch as the
   answer to our inquiry demonstrates the wisdom and grace of Him with
   whom we have to do.

   Of old, the mother of Sisera cried concerning her son, "Why is his
   chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariot?"
   (Judges 5:28). We might well appropriate these words to our present
   inquiry. On the eve of His death, the Lord Jesus said "I go to prepare
   a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
   again and receive you unto Myself, that where I am there ye may be
   also," but eighteen centuries have run their weary course since then
   and He has not yet returned! Is not this deeply mysterious? A world in
   which iniquity abounds more and more; an Israel without a home and
   without a king; a church rent by divisions and, like Samson, shorn of
   its power; a groaning creation and a war stricken earth , all unite in
   crying with the souls under the alter "How long, O Lord!" (Rev. 6:10).

   Why then such delay? Why has the millennial era of blessedness been
   thus postponed? Why has not the Redeemer returned to enter into His
   blood-bought inheritance long ere this? Stupendous questions surely.
   Questions which sometime or other exercise the hearts of all the saints
   of God. Is it possible to discover a satisfactory answer? A complete
   answer--No; for now we "know in part." But an answer--yes, an answer
   that will at least enable us to see, even though it be through a glass
   darkly, something of the meaning of our Lord's delay. Why this
   protracted interval since the time of His departure? Why has He not
   returned long ere this? We answer--

   First, because God would give man full opportunity to develop his
   schemes and thereby demonstrate the world's need of a competent Ruler.

   Man cannot complain that God has not allowed him full opportunity to
   experiment and test his own plans. Man has been permitted to do his
   utmost in ruling and regenerating the world. God, as it were, has put
   the reins of government into his hands, and withdrawn for a season.
   Why? To show whether man was sufficient for these things. To show
   whether or not man was capable of governing himself. To show whether
   man was competent to grapple successfully with the powers of evil which
   war upon his soul.

   Throughout the ages man's efforts have been directed toward ruling and
   regenerating the world. Man has been given full scope. With what
   results? With the result that the incurable hatred of the human heart
   to God and the utter depravity of human nature have been fully
   displayed. How has man used the freedom, the opportunities, the
   privileges, the talents with which his Maker has endowed him? To what
   profit has he turned them? Have they been used with the purpose of
   glorifying God or of deifying himself? To ask the question is quite
   enough. Loud have been man's boasts. Lofty have been his claims.
   Pretentious has vauntings. Such terms as improvement, advancement,
   enlightenment, evolution, civilization, have been his favorite slogans.
   But the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, and the folly of
   the world's wisdom and the vanity of man's claims are now displayed
   before our eyes. What has "civilization" effected? With all our
   so-called enlightenment and progress unto what have we attained? Let
   the records of our Law-courts tell us. Let the columns of the daily
   newspapers make response. Let the economic political and moral
   conditions of the day make answer. Let the world war with all its
   inhumanities, its barbarities, its fiendish atrocities, give reply. And
   mark, it cannot be said that these things are due to man's ignorance
   and inexperience. Man is not just starting out to make history. We are
   now living in the twentieth century of the Christian era. Man then
   cannot complain that God has not given him plenty of time to mature his
   plans. No; God has given ample time, time enough to show that he is an
   utter failure, time enough to demonstrate that he is totally incapable
   of governing himself, time enough to prove that if relief comes at all
   it must come from outside himself.

   Here then is the first part of our answer. Christ's return has been
   delayed in order to provide opportunity for man's plans to fully
   develop. God waits till harvest-time. He has been waiting for the
   harvest time of man's schemes and efforts. He has been waiting
   patiently with sickle in hand, and as soon as the crops of human
   industry have fully matured, the word will go forth--"Thrust in thy
   sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the
   harvest of the earth is ripe"(Rev. 14:15).

   Why has not our Lord returned long ere this?--We answer--

   Second, in order that God might fully display His long-sufferance.

   "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with
   the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord
   is not slack concerning His promise as some men count slackness; but is
   longsuffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that
   all should come to repentance" (2 Pet. 3:8, 9). All through these
   nineteen centuries the Lord has been saying, "Come unto Me all ye that
   labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest." Ever since the
   Saviour left the earth, God has been dealing with the world in mercy
   instead of visiting it with judgment. God's patience toward our wicked
   race has been truly marvelous. Wonderful it is that the vials of His
   wrath have not been emptied upon the nations long ere this. What
   long-sufferance Jehovah hath shown in bearing with such rebels these
   twenty centuries! Why is it that the Day of Salvation has lasted until
   it now exceeds in length every dispensation that has preceded it? Why
   is it that the door of mercy still stands open wide and God is yet
   beseeching sinners to be reconciled to Himself? Why is it that Christ
   has not long, long ago returned in flaming fire to take vengeance on
   them that know not God and obey not His Gospel? Why is it that He is
   not even now seated upon the Throne of His Glory and saying to His
   enemies, "Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for
   the devil and his angels"? Why? Ah! why? Because the Lord God is
   longsuffering to usward, not willing that any should perish. Suppose
   that Christ had returned five, ten, twenty, fifty years ago, then, in
   such case, how many who read these lines rejoicing that they have been
   accepted in the Beloved, would have perished in their sins! Join, then,
   with the writer in returning thanks for the marvelous long-sufferance
   of our gracious God.

   Why has not the Lord returned ere this? We answer--

   Third, in order that God might fully test the faith of His own people.

   This has ever been His way. Why those years of waiting before Abraham
   received Isaac? Why that protracted bondage in Egypt, when the chosen
   groaned beneath the burdens imposed on them by their cruel taskmasters?
   Why those four centuries of silence between the ministries of Malachi
   and John the Baptist? Why a four thousand years interval from the
   giving of the promise of the woman's Seed until its realization?
   Why?--to test the faith of His people, to demonstrate the reality of
   their confidence in Him. So in this dispensation. Why has our Lord
   tarried so long in the Father's house? Why these eighteen centuries for
   His church to journey through the wilderness of the world? Why is it
   that the first, the second, and the third "watch" has passed and yet
   our Lord has not come? Why did God permit the Blessed Hope to be
   recovered almost a hundred years ago, and still the Bridegroom tarries?
   Why this earnest expectation on the part of His own for three
   generations past and even now the heavens are silent? Why tarry the
   wheels of His chariot? Why?--because God would fully test the faith of
   His people. Why is He pleased to do this? To the praise of the glory of
   His grace. Perhaps to demonstrate to the angels, to whom we are "made a
   spectacle"(1 Cor. 4:9), that God has a people who by His grace can
   trust Him even amid the darkness of a profound mystery! Wonderful are
   the ways of our God. Scoffers may cry "Where is the promise of His
   coming?" Evil servants may exclaim "my Lord delayeth His coming," and
   our own wicked hearts may sometimes be tempted to murmur against the
   long delay, nevertheless, it shall yet be seen that He "doeth all
   things well."

                                  Chapter Six

                       The Signs of the Redeemer's Return

   As we have shown in the last chapter, the apostles and their converts
   looked for Christ to return in their own lifetime. They did not affirm
   that He would but they believed that He might. But eighteen centuries
   have passed since then and yet He has not come. The question therefore
   arises, What evidence is there that the second advent of our Lord is
   now nigh at hand--that is, nigh as judged even by human measurement of
   time? May there not be another eighteen centuries which must yet run
   their weary course before the Sun of righteousness arises with healing
   in His wings? Have we any means for ascertaining the approximate period
   when our Lord may be expected to appear? Have we any good ground for
   believing that another long interval will not yet elapse before the
   Saviour comes back again?

   In connection with other great events which God has brought about in
   human affairs, fair warning has been given to announce their approach.
   The Flood-judgment, the length of sojourn and the deliverance of the
   children of Israel from Egypt, and the time of our Lord's first advent,
   may be cited as illustrations. Thus, before each of the marked
   interpositions of God in the past, plain intimation of their approach
   was given. Has then the time--the approximate time--of the great
   consummating event of all events been left shrouded in such secrecy
   that it is impossible for us to know anything about it until it
   arrives? Nay verily. The inspired language of Holy Writ declares--"But
   of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write
   unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the Lord so
   cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and
   safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
   woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not
   in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all
   the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the
   night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others, but
   let us watch and be sober" (1 Thess. 5:1-6). Words could scarcely be
   plainer.

   God does not desire His people to remain in ignorance concerning the
   period when His Son shall return. Just as of old, He said concerning
   the impending destruction of Sodom "Shall I hide from Abraham that
   thing which I do?" so has God graciously taken the Church into His
   counsels and revealed to us a "part of His ways" at least. We do not
   know the day or the hour, we are unable to determine the precise year
   when the Redeemer shall return, but we do know that His coming is now
   near at hand. We know it from the testimony of God's living oracles. He
   has not left us in darkness, but has placed in our hands the more sure
   Word of Prophecy "whereunto we do well that we take heed, as unto a
   light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star
   arise in our hearts." The prophets of Old Testament times are commended
   because that they "searched what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
   which was in them did signify, when He testified beforehand the
   sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow"(1 Pet. 1:11);
   surely, then, a similar "searching" is commendable in us.

   As we study the Old Testament Scriptures we discover that a number of
   "Signs" were given to herald the first advent of Christ. There were
   conditions to be realized and certain events which would come to pass,
   and as these conditions were met and as these events occurred those who
   "looked for redemption in Jerusalem" (Luke 2:38) saw in these things so
   many intimations of the approach of Messiah's advent and His public
   manifestation. The Scriptures of Israel revealed the fact that the
   Redeemer would be born in Bethlehem of Judea (Micah 5:2); they foretold
   that He should be a lineal descendant of David and therefore of the
   Tribe of Judah (Ps. 132:11); they announced that a forerunner should go
   before Him make straight His way (Isaiah 40:3); they went so far as to
   set forth the approximate date of His appearing, namely, before the
   scepter had departed from Judah (Gen. 49:10), while the Temple was yet
   standing (Mal. 3:1), and sometime before the sixty-ninth week of Daniel
   had run its course (Dan. 9:24-27). In like manner, the New Testament
   Scriptures also record certain "Signs" in connection with our Lord's
   second coming to the earth. We say "to the earth," for let it be
   distinctly understood that Scripture interposes nothing whatever
   between the present hour and the coming of Christ for His saints, when
   He descends into the air and catches them up to Himself. All the
   "Signs" recorded in the Word of God have to do with His return to the
   earth. But as there will be only a comparatively short interval between
   the two stages in the second coming of Christ, the Signs which proclaim
   the one announce the other. If the fulfillment of certain inspired
   predictions declare that the return of Christ to the earth is near at
   hand, then His descent to the air is so much nearer still. If we know
   that the end of the Age itself is now almost reached, then it is doubly
   certain that the rapture of the saints may occur at any hour. Yet, we
   repeat, the various Signs to which we shall call our readers' attention
   have to do with our Lord's return to the earth. We repeat this for the
   sake of warning, for as another has said, the business of the Christian
   is not to be looking for signs but listening for a Shout (Haldeman).
   Yet, while we ought not to be looking for signs we may look at them (W.
   Scott).

   As we have said, the Old testament Scriptures foretold certain things
   concerning the Lord when He should appear: fore-announced Signs were to
   characterize the times of His advent. But the Jews failed to discern
   these Signs and the Saviour reproached them for their failure. Said He,
   "When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is
   red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is
   red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky;
   but can ye not discern the Signs of the Times?" (Matt. 16:2, 3). The
   reason why the Pharisees and Sadducees were blind to the significance
   of the things which were then transpiring before their eyes, was that
   they were ignorant of the contents of that Book in which these Signs
   were recorded. This is clear from the words of our Lord on many
   occasions--"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures"(Matt. 22:29). The
   reason why they were ignorant of the contents and real meaning of the
   Scriptures was because they had substituted their own "tradition" for
   the Word of God (Mark 7:13). And history has repeated itself! We are
   living in a day when the vast majority of people are unable to "discern
   the Signs of the Times," when our religious leaders "err, not knowing
   the Scriptures" because they are following their own "tradition" rather
   than the Word of God. The Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees and
   Sadducees because they could "discern the face of the sky" but would
   not take the necessary pains to "discern the Signs of the Times." Then
   let us beware lest we fall through the same example of unbelief. Let us
   approach the Scriptures reverently and prayerfully, seeking to discover
   our position on the calendar of prophecy and thus be prepared for the
   solemn yet blessed events now so near at hand.

   While it is true that the great majority of the Jews who lived during
   the days of our Lord's first advent failed to discern the Signs of the
   Times and in consequence did not profit by the announcements of their
   prophets, nevertheless, there were a few who were "waiting for the
   Consolation of Israel" (Luke 2:25), And so it is now. By the grace of
   God, there is a remnant today who are reading the Signs of the Times in
   the light cast by the prophetic Word. At some of these Signs we shall
   now look. And
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. The Recovery and Revival of the Blessed Hope itself.

   In Daniel 12:4, 9, 10 we read--"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words,
   and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and
   fro, and knowledge shall be increased. ** And he said, Go thy way,
   Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the Time of the
   End. Many shall be purified, and made white and tried; but the wicked
   shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the
   wise shall understand." [9] As we shall yet seek to show this prophecy
   is a composite one and its fulfillment is being manifested in many
   different directions. That to which we would now direct attention is
   the manner in which this prediction has been accomplished in connection
   with the Scriptures and particularly in regard to the modern interest
   and wide-spread study of Prophecy.

   As is well known, the book of Daniel is largely composed of prophecies,
   prophecies which refer frequently to the closing days of the Times of
   the Gentiles. The Scripture now before us makes known seven fats,
   namely--first, that the contents of Daniel's prophecies were to be
   "shut up" and "sealed;" second, that the book of Daniel should not
   remain a "sealed" book for ever; third, that at "the Time of the End"
   it should be unsealed, for it was to be "shut up" only "to" and "till"
   the Time of the End; fourth, that at the Time of the End there should
   be a "running to and fro," in other words, there should be a revival of
   interest in the prophetic word, an earnest inquiry and seeking for
   light; fifth, that as the result of this revival of interest in and
   study of the prophetic word "knowledge shall be increased;" sixth, as
   the consequence of this "increase of knowledge" many would be
   "purified, and made white, and tried;" seventh, that notwithstanding
   this, the wicked would "do wickedly" and none of them would
   "understand," thus are we told in this last item that the understanding
   of the Word of God is a matter of spiritual discernment and not a
   question of intellectual acumen: if it were the latter then the wicked
   might understand as readily as the righteous (compare Matt. 13:10-15).
   Let us briefly consider these seven points and note how remarkably they
   are verified in present-day conditions.

   Daniel was informed that the things he had seen and the communications
   which he had heard were not to be turned to use for the present. All
   was to be as a sealed book until a distant day, in fact would be "shut
   up" until the Time of the End. How accurately and literally this part
   of our prediction has been fulfilled may best be seen by reviewing the
   writings of theologians and commentators who lived prior to the last
   century. For the most part the prophecies of Daniel have been utterly
   neglected until recently, and where attempts were made to open up its
   contents the wildest theories were indulged and the most absurd
   interpretations were adopted. There was no spiritual understanding. The
   book was "shut up!" But the book of Daniel was not to be shut up for
   ever. God had some wise purpose in making these disclosures to His
   prophet, He had some good reason in making known to Daniel the trend
   and end of the various world empires.

   At the Time of the End the contents of the book of Daniel were to be
   opened and unsealed, for many would "run to and fro" and knowledge
   would be "increased." How plainly has this mark of the end been
   manifesting itself during the past century! Though, the masses still
   turn from prophecy as from a sealed book, yet what a stir and study has
   it awakened in many earnest minds! "Many" have turned to the word of
   prophecy (witness the great number of books now written on the subject)
   and given their most sedulous attention to the understanding of its
   contents. Particularly has this been the case with the book of Daniel
   itself. Large numbers of God's people have been moved to inquire
   concerning the things recorded therein and have spared no pains or cost
   to obtain a knowledge of them, and under the blessing of God and the
   guidance of His Spirit light upon this book is steadily increasing and
   its mysterious hieroglyphics are becoming clearer and plainer as the
   fulfillment of its predictions draws nearer. Expositors of this
   important book may differ in details but in the main they are agreed
   and their leading conclusions are the same.

   The result of this earnest and widespread study of prophecy is seen in
   the increased devotion and consecration of God's people--"many shall be
   purified and made white." Side by side with increasing light on
   prophecy has come a deepened sense of responsibility toward the lost.
   It is a striking fact that the remarkable growth in Foreign Missions of
   last century synchronized with the widespread turning to the prophetic
   Word. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the heathen were,
   with rare exceptions, utterly neglected, so also was it with the book
   of Daniel. On the other hand, it strict accord with Daniel's prophecy,
   side by side with the increase of prophetic light and its purifying
   effects on the people of God, we find the "wicked doing wickedly" and
   that none of them "understand"--i.e., that the wicked are in utter
   ignorance of the terrible times (referred to in Daniel) which lie just
   ahead of them.

   One of the most marked and blessed results of the widespread inquiry
   and enlightenment upon the subject of prophecy has been the recovery
   and revival of the Blessed Hope. We believe it is to this that Daniel's
   prophecy (in its present-day application) refers when it says "but the
   wise shall understand." The "wise" are those who are governed by God's
   Word and whose thoughts are formed by the teaching of Holy Writ, for
   "The entrance of Thy words giveth light" (Ps. 119-130). What is it that
   the "wise" understand? They "understand" the meaning of the days in
   which they are living. They "understand" that the last days of the age
   are upon us. They "understand" that we have now reached "the Time of
   the End." They "understand" that "the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."

   Parallel with the prophecy of Daniel is the teaching of Christ in the
   parable of the Bridegroom and the virgins. This parable sets forth the
   several attitudes of the Lord's people, in different periods of this
   Dispensation, with reference to their expectation of the Redeemer's
   Return and was uttered in response to the disciples questions (recorded
   at the beginning of the previous chapter) "What shall be the sign of
   Thy coming and of the end of the age?" At the beginning of the
   Christian era all His followers were waiting for the Lord's appearing.
   Then followed a mixed condition--part were wise and part were foolish.
   Then, while the Bridegroom tarried, "they all slumbered and slept." The
   Blessed Hope was lost and the church lapsed into a condition of
   spiritual apathy. But this sleep was to be broken. It was foretold that
   at the midnight hour a cry should be made--"Behold, the Bridegroom
   cometh; go ye out to meet Him" (Matt. 25:6). This was a prophetic
   announcement that just before our Lord returned, a loud and distinct
   testimony concerning His coming would be sounded upon the dull ear of
   Christendom. This Cry is now going forth. Everywhere the servants of
   God are proclaiming the news that the Lord is at hand. All over the
   world the cry is being raised, "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye
   out to meet Him." Never since the days of the apostles has there been
   so much yearning and longing, preaching and teaching, watching and
   praying, upon the subject of Christ's second coming as there is now.

   The parable of the Bridegroom and the virgins corresponds very closely
   with the prophecy of Daniel 12. The midnight Cry--the recovery of the
   Blessed Hope--matches the unsealing of the prophetic word and the
   "increase" of "knowledge." The arising of the virgins agrees with the
   "running to and fro." The "trimming" of their lamps--preparation for
   the Lord's appearing--tallies with the many being "purified." The two
   classes--the wise and the foolish virgins--corresponds exactly with the
   two classes mentioned by Daniel--the "wise" and the "wicked," for just
   as it is said that "none of the wicked shall understand," so the
   foolish virgins shall declare "our lamps are gone out"--they will be in
   the dark!

   One other Scripture which confirms us in saying that one of the Signs
   which heralds the Return of Christ is the midnight Cry, is to be found
   in 2 Pet. 3:3, 4--"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the
   last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying Where is
   the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all
   things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
   Observe that it is in the "last days" (of this Age) that there should
   arise a class who shall scoff at the promise of Christ's return, which
   is further intimation that at the Time of the End there would be a
   renewed and special testimony to the Blessed Hope.

   To return to Daniel's prophecy. "But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words
   and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and
   fro, and knowledge shall be increased"(Dan. 12:4). These words must not
   be limited to an application which confines it to the increase of light
   on the prophetic word, but should be taken in their widest
   signification. We believe they have reference to the recent and
   phenomenal increase both in Travel and Knowledge. The words "run to and
   fro" would seem to point to modern methods of transportation. How this
   mark of the end time is being manifested today is well known to all.
   "Railways cover the earth, and steamers track the sea like a mighty
   spider's web" (Blackstone). Automobiles have become commoner than
   horses, and appearances indicate that within a few years at most
   aeroplanes will be used as a regular means of travel. Observe that our
   text says, "Many shall run to and fro." Restlessness now seems to be
   common to human nature. The rising generation is obsessed with this
   spirit of running to and fro. Witness the enormous growth of
   immigration. Study railroad statistics and mark the rapid increase in
   the number of passengers carried, now numbering hundreds of millions
   annually. How accurately these words "many shall run to and fro"
   describe present-day conditions! Everything is in a turmoil. Everybody
   is on the run, and hence it is that the Day of Rest has become a thing
   of the past.

   "And knowledge shall be increased." What advances have been made in the
   educational realm! Facilities which hitherto were available to only a
   privileged class are now open to the children of the artisan and common
   laborer. Illiteracy will soon be a thing of the past. By the
   multiplication of schools, colleges and universities "knowledge" has
   been marvelously increased. Another agency for increasing knowledge is
   the press. "The public press, with its ceaseless streams of news and
   information, covers the earth with its ever increasing circulation,
   like falling leaves from some mighty tree of knowledge. And of the
   making of many books, there is truly no end" (Blackstone).

   Witness the remarkable increase of scientific knowledge. Contrast our
   present-day knowledge of astronomy, archeology, zoology, physiology,
   psychology, with what was known about them even one hundred years ago.
   How wonderfully man has harnessed to his service the forces of Nature!
   Things never dreamed of by our grandparents are now actualities, and
   many of them mere common places. What discoveries have been made! What
   inventions have been perfected! What triumphs have been achieved on
   land and sea, in the air and under the waters! How the discovery and
   utilization of electricity has revolutionized every department of our
   life! Truly, scientific knowledge has been increased.

   The above parable corresponds very closely with the first three found
   in Matthew 13. Like them it is prophetic in its scope. Its
   dispensational application is simple yet remarkable. The sowing of the
   seed here is the same as the sowing of the seed in Matthew 13 and
   relates to the gracious mission of the Lord and His apostles at the
   beginning of this dispensation. The seed was the Word of God (Luke
   8:11). The period of "sleep" (Compare Matt. 13:25; 25:5) was the
   spiritual lethargy of the third and fourth centuries which merged into
   the "Dark Ages," and corresponded with the order of nature. The natural
   seed sown into the ground becomes corrupt and dies, or almost dies; and
   so it was with the Divine seed. The epistles of the New Testament
   furnish evidence of how quickly and how sadly the purity of the Word
   became corrupted with the grossest errors and adulterations. But yet it
   lived. And more, it "grew." The language used in the parable describing
   the order of growth corresponds exactly with its prophetic fulfillment.
   There was first the "blade," which in nature continues in a feeble
   state of vitality for a long time. So it was with the Divine "seed" all
   through the "Dark Ages." "Then the ear:" does not this point
   prophetically, to the Reformation period when copies of the Scriptures
   were multiplied a hundredfold and given once more to the masses in
   their own tongue. "After that the full corn in the ear." How
   remarkable! as the harvest approaches, the original seed now
   re-appears, though greatly multiplied in quantity. And this is exactly
   what we are witnessing today. Many long lost truths, truths which have
   been buried beneath the soil of human tradition, have been given back
   to the people of God. And, as to multiplication in quantity, contrast
   the millions of copies of the Scriptures now in circulation with the
   limited number in use in the first century when printing was unknown.
   Yes, the Seed has "grown" though man "knoweth not how." But note the
   next words: "But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he
   putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come." How unspeakably
   solemn! What follows the "full corn in the ear?" "Immediately," we are
   told, "he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come." Compare
   with this Matt. 13:39--"the harvest is the end of the age." And compare
   further Rev. 14:15--"Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is
   come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!" Thus by
   putting side by side our Lord's teaching in the above parable with the
   prophecy of Daniel we find that the "full corn in the ear" corresponds
   with "increase of knowledge" and "immediately he putteth in the sickle
   because the harvest is come" ("the harvest is the end of the age"Matt.
   13:39) agrees with the "Time of the End."

   To review and sum up: From Daniel 12 we learn that at the Time of the
   End knowledge shall be increased; from Matthew 25 we learn there would
   be a recovery of the Blessed Hope and a proclamation concerning the
   imminent Return of the Bridegroom; from 2 Peter 3 we also learn that in
   the "last days" there is to be a renewed and special testimony borne
   respecting the second coming of Christ; and in Mark 4 we learn that the
   Divine seed (the Word) was to grow until it brought forth the "full
   corn in the ear" and that this increase of fruitage occurred
   "immediately" before the harvest. How wonderful and how perfect is the
   harmony of Scripture! The fact that these things are now spread before
   our eyes declares in language loud and clear to all who have ears to
   hear that the Time of the End has been reached, that the Bridegroom is
   now at hand, that the "last days" are already entered upon, and that
   the Harvest--symbol of Divine judgment--is impending and to be expected
   "immediately."

   [9] While this prophecy has primary reference to Daniel's people, the
   Jews, and so far as they are concerned will receive its accomplishment
   in the "godly remnant" of the Tribulation period, yet like all
   prophecy, this also has a double fulfillment and therefore has a
   secondary application to the Church of God today.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The Apostasy which prepares the way for the Antichrist.

   The question has often been raised and is still hotly disputed as to
   whether the world is getting better or worse. Are conditions in general
   more propitious or more iniquitous? From one viewpoint conditions are
   improving, from another they are deteriorating. Good and evil are now
   both of them rapidly coming to a head. This is exactly what our Lord
   foretold in the parable of the Tares--"Let both grow together until the
   harvest" (Matt. 13:30). Both the wheat and the tares are growing. Hence
   it is that present-day conditions are so conflicting. Godliness and
   lawlessness, good and evil are, side by side, each advancing, the
   conflict between them ever increasing in severity. And hence it is that
   side by side with the increase of spiritual light and prophetic
   knowledge, we are now witnessing also a wide-spread departure from the
   Truth. As the light increases the shadows deepen. It is written, "The
   path of the just shineth more and more unto the perfect day" (Prov.
   4:18); but, it is written again, "Evil men and seducers shall wax worse
   and worse"(2 Tim. 3:13).

   Of old, the question was asked, "Watchman what of the night!" and the
   answer from the lonely watcher upon his lofty tower was "The morning
   cometh, and also the night" (Is. 21:11, 12). Here again we meet with a
   seemingly conflicting testimony. Yet, the conditions which prevailed in
   Isaiah's day are precisely the same which characterize ours. "The
   morning cometh," the morning of the Perfect Day. As we have shown
   above, the intimations of the approaching Morn are unmistakable. The
   increasing light vouchsafed by God upon His Word together with the
   recovery of the Blessed Hope, herald the approach of the Morning Star,
   which shall precede by a few years the arising of the Sun of
   righteousness with healing in His wings.

   "And also the night." The Night which shall draw down the curtain upon
   "man's day." The Night of the world's judgment, when "the darkness
   shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people" (Is. 60:2). The
   Night of the Great Tribulation when "the sun shall be darkened, and the
   moon shall not give her light" (Matt. 24:29). The Night when the Power
   of Darkness shall be given full sway for a little season because men
   loved darkness rather than light. That Night which shall so soon come
   upon Christendom because it has turned away from God's Word which is a
   lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. And the intimations of
   the approaching Night are as marked and as plain as are the heralds of
   the coming Day. Consider one of them.

   "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
   except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be
   revealed, the son of perdition." (2 Thess. 2:3). The "day" mentioned
   here is the Day of the Lord (see Is. 2) which follows the present day
   of man. The Day of the lord succeeds the Day of Salvation, now so
   nearly ended, and its character and course is fully described in the
   last book of the Bible. The "man of sin, the son of perdition" referred
   to in our text will come before us for consideration in a later
   chapter, sufficient now to say that he makes his appearance some time
   after the Rapture of the Church and that he continues in his terrible
   course of open defiance of God until the Lord Jesus returns in power to
   the earth when He shall destroy this Wicked One by the brightness of
   His coming. The "falling away" (apostasy--Greek) is one of the things
   which shall be the harbinger of the Day of the Lord and prepare the way
   for the revelation of the Antichrist. The fact that the "falling away"
   has already commenced, yea, has even now advanced a terrible distance,
   is proof that the appearing of the Man of Sin is nigh at hand, and
   therefore that the "last days" of this dispensation are upon us.

   The "falling away" which 2 Thess. 2:3 predicts has reference to
   departure from the Word of God, and apostasy from the faith once
   delivered unto the saints. Specifically, it refers to repudiation of
   the Truth by those who are its professed friends. The fulfillment of
   this solemn prophecy has now been going on for upwards of half a
   century, and sad to say, the circle in which it is receiving its
   accomplishment is ever growing wider and wider. More than forty years
   ago the late C. H. Spurgeon protested faithfully and fearlessly against
   the "Downgrade movement" of his day, and owing to the doctrinal
   looseness and theological unsoundness of many of its leading spirits
   withdrew from the English Baptist Union. The "Downgrade" has gone on
   apace since then. The majority of our Seminaries in which our preachers
   receive their theological training, are hot-beds of rationalism,
   skepticism, and infidelity. The deadliest foes of the Faith are now to
   be found inside of the professing Church and not outside as hitherto.
   The "vain philosophies" and Scripture-denying heresies of such
   agnostics as Darwin and Huxley are now openly espoused and
   enthusiastically proclaimed from many of our leading pulpits.

   The "falling away" has had an awful exemplification in the "Higher
   Criticism" movement, a movement which originated with atheists but has
   operated within the professing Church. The "Higher Critics" are men who
   deny the supernatural element in the Scriptures, who undermine their
   authority and belittle their value. They are rationalists whose minds
   are blinded by the god of this world, whose they are and whom they
   serve. No censure of them can possibly be too severe. The inspired
   apostle referred to them when he said, "But there were false prophets
   also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you,
   who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord
   that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction" (2 Pet.
   2:1). The words that follow this terrific indictment, reveal the sad
   havoc wrought by these apostates, and tells us of the doom which awaits
   them--"And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom
   the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness
   shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment
   now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not"
   (vs. 2, 3).

   The "falling away" is evidenced on every hand. Not only are many of our
   Seminaries cesspools of spiritual corruption, not only are hundreds of
   our pulpits now filled by traitors to the cause they profess to
   champion, not only is every cardinal doctrine of the faith attacked and
   denied by the very ones paid to defend them, but the evil effects of
   such teaching from our religious leaders has influenced multitudes of
   souls committed to their care. The man in the pew, following the lead
   of his teachers, has lost faith in the Bible as a Divine revelation,
   and in consequence, no longer submits to its authority. Hence it is
   that there is such a "falling away" in the number of genuine
   conversions--we say "genuine" conversions because there are multitudes
   of those who come forward to shake some popular preacher by the hand,
   multitudes of card-signers, "trail-hitters" etc., etc. Hence it is that
   there has been such a sad and such a wide-spread "falling away" from
   the old time family worship. Hence it is that we now witness such a
   lamentable "falling away" from the mid-week prayer-meeting. Hence it is
   that there is such an awful "falling away" from the observance of the
   Holy Sabbath. Hence it is that there is such a fearful "falling away"
   from the moral standards of former days. Hence it is that there is now
   such an ever-growing "falling away" from Sunday School attendance all
   over the land. Yes, the "falling away" has commenced and is already far
   advanced.

   The "falling away" is also to be seen in the many false systems of
   recent development. We may cite as illustrations the "New Theology"
   formulated and popularized by R. J. Campbell; "Christian Science" (so
   called) with its repudiation of sin and the vicarious Sacrifice of
   Christ; "Russellism" with its horrible blasphemies upon the person of
   our Lord and its erroneous and soul-destroying heresy of the "second
   chance;" "Spiritualism" with its intercourse with demons who
   impersonate the dead. Formerly, three-fourths of the votaries of these
   anti-Christian systems were outwardly attached to the Truth, inasmuch
   as they were members of evangelical denominations. The same "falling
   away" may be seen in the rapid decay of Protestantism and the silent
   but sure growth of Roman Catholicism.

   The "falling away" which characterizes our day was referred to by the
   apostle when he said, "For the time will come when they will not endure
   sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves
   teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from
   the truth, and shall be turned unto fables" (2 Tim. 4:3, 4). That time
   has arrived! Church-goers today will not endure "sound doctrine." Those
   who preach the total depravity of man, who insist upon the imperative
   necessity of the new birth, who set forth the inflexible righteousness
   and holiness of God, and who warn against the Eternal and conscious
   torment awaiting every rejector of Christ, find it almost impossible to
   obtain a hearing. Such preachers are regarded as puritanical
   pessimists, and are not wanted. In these degenerate times, the masses
   demand that which will soothe them in their sins and amuse them while
   they journey down the Broad Road. The multitude is affected with
   "itching ears" which crave novelty and that which is sensational. They
   have ears which wish to be "tickled," ears which eagerly drink in the
   songs of professional and unsaved soloists and choristers, ears which
   are well pleased with the vulgar slang of our modern evangelists.
   Concurrent with this "Falling away" we may note,
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. The Laodicean state of Christendom.

   In Revelation two and three we have seven Epistles addressed to the
   seven churches in Asia. These Epistles--in keeping with the nature of
   the book in which they are found--are prophetic in their scope. They
   record the sentences of the Divine Judge who appears in the midst of
   these churches (see 1:13-20) inspecting and passing decisions. They
   contain a panorama of the Church's history. They give us a complete
   outline of the entire course of the Christian profession, of going from
   bad to worse, until at the end a condition is reached which compels the
   Lord to utterly repudiate that which bears His name. We cannot now do
   more than hurriedly trace the order of thought and point out the
   leading features in these seven prophetic pictures. [10]

   The first of these Epistles is addressed to the church at Ephesus and
   is recorded in Revelation 2:1-7. In it we have viewed the originating
   cause of the declination which began in the apostolic age. "Thou hast
   left thy first love" (vs. 4)--the cooling of the church's affection for
   Christ was the source of all the evil that followed. There was much
   outward zeal, but the heart was not right, and where love declines evil
   practices soon follow. Even so was it at the early date contemplated by
   the first of these seven Epistles, for at Ephesus we learn there were
   "false apostles" (vs. 2) and "Nicolaitanes" whose deeds were "hateful"
   to Christ and the Ephesians themselves (vs. 6). "Remember therefore
   from whence thou art fallen, and repent" (vs. 5) shows the beginning of
   the downward path.

   In the second Epistle addressed to the church in Smyrna and recorded in
   Revelation 2:8-11, we have a prophetic picture which describes the
   conditions that prevailed from John's time till the beginning of the
   fourth century A.D.--a period of persecution and martyrdom. Here we are
   shown a Judaizing Christianity spreading within the church, and mention
   is made of the "synagogue of Satan" (vs. 9).

   In the Epistle to the third church--Pergamos (Rev. 2:12-17)--we find
   the progress in evil is still more marked. The prophetic application of
   this Epistle carries us on to the days of Constantine when the church
   and the world joined hands. This unholy alliance was foreshadowed by
   the name of the church addressed, for Pergamos signifies a "marriage."
   Here we read of "Satan's throne"). Here, too, mention is again made of
   the Nicolaitanes, but whereas in Ephesus it was the "deeds of the
   Nicolaitanes" (vs. 6) that were mentioned, here it is the "doctrine of
   the Nicolaitanes" (vs. 15)--false practices had now become articles of
   faith. Observe that at first the church "hated" their deeds (vs. 6),
   here their evil beliefs were tolerated and cherished.

   In the fourth Epistle--to Thyatira (Rev. 2:18-29) we have disclosed a
   yet fouler condition of ecclesiastical corruption and are carried
   forward to the rise of Roman Catholicism, which is here termed
   "Jezebel"--"Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because
   thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess,
   to teach and to seduce My servants to commit fornication, and to eat
   things sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her space to repent of her
   fornication; and she repented not" (vss. 20, 21). That "space" began at
   the Reformation period and has lasted till now, but the Papacy is still
   unchanged.

   In the fifth Epistle addressed to the church in Sardis (3:1-6) we are
   brought down to the days of Martin Luther and his contemporaries, when
   many of God's people were delivered from Popery. Observe here "Thou
   hast a name" (vs. 1). That name was "Protestantism" which defined both
   their claim and testimony. But note further, "Thou hast a name that
   thou livest, and art dead." Thus it has proven; so it is today.
   Protestantism is now nothing more than a "name," its vitality has long
   since departed. How this latter-day condition was anticipated by the
   very terms of this Epistle may be seen by the language of verses 2 and
   3--"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready
   to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember
   therefore how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast, and
   repent." Alas! that this admonition passed unheeded. "But, are all
   within the circle of Protestantism now spiritually dead?" it may be
   asked. No; and mark the prophetic accuracy of this Epistle--"Thou hast
   a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments" (vs.
   4)!

   In the sixth Epistle addressed to the church in Philadelphia (3:7-13)
   we are brought down to the last century. Three things are to be noted
   here. First, Philadelphia signifies "brotherly love" and it was during
   the last century particularly that this Christian grace was
   acknowledged and displayed. Not until the nineteenth century was the
   truth of the Unity of the Church recovered and the common brotherhood
   of believers practically owned. Second, the Lord sets before this
   church an "open door" (vs. 8), a door which He had opened Himself. This
   was the "door" which led to the Foreign Mission field, and it was not
   until last century that age-long barriers were so wonderfully removed
   by God and world-wide evangelism made practically easy. Third, "Thou
   hast a little strength"(vs. 8) accurately describes the condition of
   the church during the last hundred years.

   We turn now to consider at a little more length the seventh Epistle,
   addressed to the church of the Laodiceans (Rev. 3:14-22). This Epistle
   portrays the last state of the professing church on earth, a state
   characterized by high pretensions and self-sufficiency, but so utterly
   nauseous to Christ that He declares "I know thy works, that thou art
   neither cold nor hot: I would that thou wert cold or hot. So then
   because thou art lukewarm I will sue thee out of My mouth"(vss. 15,
   16).

   The word Laodicea means "the rule of the laity or people." It is the
   people's church, not Christ's for notice He is outside (vs. 20),
   standing and knocking for admission. Its condition is described as
   "lukewarm:" it is neither one thing nor the other, partly hot and
   partly cold. How accurately this describes the present day condition of
   the professing church! A condition of mixture--mixed up with the world,
   claiming to be heavenly and yet clinging to everything that is earthly;
   bearing the name of Christ, and yet misrepresenting Him and putting Him
   to an open shame. Much religion but little life. Much activity but
   little vitality. Much doing but little accomplished. Much display but
   little power. Neither hot nor cold: neither out and out for God, nor
   out and out for the Devil. "Luke warm," as though hot and cold water
   had been poured into the same vessel. This is exactly what we have in
   the churches today--intense worldliness and wickedness veneered over
   with humanitarian and religious pretenses.

   Another characteristic of Laodicea is the spirit of boosting--"Thou
   sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing"
   (vs. 17). Loud and lofty are the pretensions of the professing church,
   but how shallow they really are! There is much ostentatious parading of
   resources, but it is an empty profession. There is self-conceit, showy
   attainments, architectural display, intellectual acquirements,
   influential numbers, but Christ is excluded! In this church (see the
   Epistle), unlike all the previous ones, there is nothing whatever in it
   that Christ commends--sad commentary upon its true condition! But this
   is merely negative: there is much in it that He condemns--"and knowest
   not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
   naked" (vs. 17). The church is utterly ignorant of its actual and
   deplorable state. Its leaders are crying "Peace and safety" when
   "sudden destruction" is upon them (1 Thess. 5:3). Unspeakably sad is
   this. Whenever there is recognition of our condition and our need,
   there is hope, for recognition and acknowledgement of weakness is the
   secret of strength (2 Cor. 12:9). But self-complacency is fatal. For
   self-righteousness there is no remedy. Though self-sufficient and
   self-righteous the professing church will shortly be "spued out" by the
   One whose name it bears.

   Now observe particularly that this "Laodicean" Epistle is the final one
   of the series. It sets before us the last state of the professing
   church on earth. In keeping with this note the time-mark here. The Lord
   speaks of "supping" (vs. 20). It is eventime. It is the closing meal of
   the day! The end is at hand. The church is feasting inside and the
   Saviour is standing outside. Such was what was predicted eighteen
   centuries ago, and such is what we now witness in Christendom today.
   Christ is now outside the professing church undesired, unheard,
   unknown. And, we repeat, this Epistle is the final one of the series:
   there is no eighth which follows it. The Laodicean condition is the
   last phase of apostate Christendom. Nought remains but its spueing out.
   The very next thing we read of in Revelation after the Laodicean
   Epistle is--"After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in
   heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
   talking with me; which said, Come up hither" etc. (4:1) which clearly
   symbolizes the catching up of the saints. But we turn now to consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] These Epistles to the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 1:11) were
   addressed to churches which were in existence when John wrote the
   Apocalypse and therefore their local application was to these historic
   assemblies. But that these Epistles have a wider, a prophetic
   application and signification is clear from several considerations. In
   the first place the number of the churches here addressed-seven-is
   significant. There were other churches in Asia besides those addressed,
   but they are here ignored. The fact that Christ addressed Himself to
   seven, neither more nor less, seems to argue that, in harmony with the
   uniform significance of this numeral, a complete outline of something
   is here presented. In the second place, there is some "mystery"
   connected with these seven Epistles as is clear from our Lord's words
   in Rev. 1:20. This is further borne out by the call which is sounded in
   each Epistle-"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
   unto the churches"-imitating that they contain a special message heard
   only by those who are attent to the "still small" voice." In the third
   place, the order of these Epistles (in their contents) corresponds
   exactly with the history of the professing church and this agreement
   cannot be a mere coincidence, but must be due to Divine design.
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. The Prophecy of the Perilous Times.

   This prophecy is found in 2 Tim. 3 and is another delineation of the
   professing church in the last days. It is particularly to be noted that
   the verses we are about to consider, describe not mankind in general
   but Christendom in particular. Note now the several lines in this
   picture. Lengthy comment is needless.

   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For
   men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
   blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy." "Men shall be
   lovers of their own selves"--two things, closely connected, are
   referred to: selfishness and egotism. Self-lovers! Was there ever a
   time when there was so much self-seeking and self-pleasing, and so
   little self-sacrifice by professing Christians?
   "Covetous"--money-lovers. What fortunes are now amassed by those who
   claim to be not their own but bought with a price! Our average
   church-member is as greedy and grasping as the worldling.
   "Boasters"--intellectual boasting--laying claim to the possession of a
   wisdom and scholarship unknown to our forefathers; ecclesiastical
   boasting, evidenced in denominational pride; and what is most obnoxious
   of all, spiritual boasting--the profession of superior piety, the
   advertising of a "victorious life," "baptism of the Spirit," "sinless
   perfection," etc. "Proud"--proud of their culture, liberality and
   broadmindedness. How different from the One who said, "Take My yoke
   upon you, and learn of Me: for I am meek and lowly in
   heart.""Blasphemers"--Christian Scientists (?), Russellites, Higher
   Critics, etc. "Disobedient to parents." When was this deplorable sign
   of insubordination so rife as it is today? Instead of parents ruling
   their children, children now rule their parents, and, of course, the
   parents are to blame. This failure to exercise parental authority, this
   rebellion in the young which will brook no restraint, is the certain
   forerunner of the downfall of the State, fostering, as it does, the
   spirit of lawlessness. "Unthankful"--temporal blessings received as a
   matter of course without any recognition of their Giver. God's
   providential mercies unappreciated. Returning of thanks at mealtime,
   almost entirely a thing of the past. "Unholy" which has reference to
   the utter absence of separation from the world: the disappearance of
   the Nazarite spirit.

   Behold further characteristics of the Perilous Times--"without natural
   affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,
   despisers of those that are good. Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers
   of pleasure more than lovers of God" (2 Tim. 3:4). It is needless to
   enlarge upon each separate item, but mark the first and the last of
   those enumerated here. "Without natural affection." How terribly this
   is exemplified today in the enormous increase of divorces, in the
   abandonment of their infant offspring by unnatural mothers, and in the
   neglect of the poor, the sick, the aged! "Lovers of pleasure more than
   lovers of God." See our church-members on the Lord's day, preferring a
   ride in their automobiles to the assembling of themselves together with
   the people of God. Mark them on prayer-meeting nights at the
   picture-shows instead of at the throne of grace. And witness the
   musical programmes, the entertainments, the ice-cream suppers etc.,
   held in our church-houses.

   "But, it may be asked, "have not these things always been true of men
   in general?" Perhaps so, more or less, though never to the same extent
   as now. But these verses do not describe "general conditions," they
   depict Christendom as it exists in the "last days." This is clear from
   the next verse--"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power
   thereof: from such turn away" (vs. 5). There is music but it is of the
   siren kind, not the singing, and making melody in our hearts to the
   Lord. There is eloquence but it is the wisdom which man's words
   teacheth, and not that which speaks for God and wins souls. There is
   fervour but it is the heat of carnal excitement born of novelty and
   sensationalism, and not that which cometh down from above. There is
   zeal, but it is without knowledge. There is a demand for righteousness,
   but it is civic and social righteousness and not the righteousness of
   God. There is love but it is a sickly sentimentality and not that which
   is the fulfilling of the law. There is gospel-preaching, but it is
   "another gospel" and not the gospel of the grace of God. There is much
   religion, but it is lacking in life. There are notorious evangelistic
   campaigns, but they are devoid of spirituality. There is much
   ritualistic performance but it is a form of godliness without its
   power.

   "For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
   silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts" (vs. 6). We
   believe the reference is to Mormonism, yet the principle is of still
   wider application. How striking it is that we should read of "silly
   women" in this inspired list of "last days" characteristics! Observe
   the way this is fulfilled in modern Feminism! Observe the words "led
   away with divers lusts," which might be freely rendered "ambitious
   desires." This craving for publicity, this deplorable masculinity, this
   denial of man's headship, this unsurping of authority, is one of the
   most striking Signs of the Times. We refer, not only to the modern
   Suffragette movement which makes every self-respecting woman blush for
   shame at the immodesty of her sisters, but also to the attitude and
   position taken by so many "silly women" in the churches. How sad it is
   to see the plain command of God--"Let your women keep silence in the
   churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak" (1 Cor.
   14:34)--now so generally disregarded. Today there are not a few who
   unblushingly denounce the inspired apostle as "an old bachelor with
   narrow ideas" (Ironside).

   Now mark that what we have been considering above is a part of a
   Divinely drawn picture describing the Perilous Times of the "last
   days." How clear it is that the Perilous Times are now upon us, Times
   that are "perilous" to the souls of God's people, "perilous" to the
   spread of the Gospel, "perilous" to the whole of Christendom. How
   evident it is to those who have eyes to see that we have already
   entered into the "last days." And how dark are the immediate prospects
   for the world!

   Take note of one other item in this striking prophecy--"But evil men
   and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived"
   (2 Tim. 3:13). Surely moral conditions cannot get much worse than they
   are now. Immorality has come in like a flood which is ever swelling and
   widening in its course. "Uncleanness is rampant. There is an army of
   over thirty thousand painted prostitutes in Chicago alone. This sin of
   impurity, the greatest of the age, is literally undermining and
   honeycombing the nations till they are now tottering to their fall."
   (R.V. Miller). How true this statement is appears from a recent speech
   made by Secretary Daniels of the U.S. Navy. In the course of an address
   which he delivered before the Clinical Congress of Surgeons of North
   America he said:--"There is not an army in the field whose
   effectiveness is not reduced by reason of immoral diseases. The navy
   suffers likewise and business halts because venereal diseases destroy
   the manhood of workmen and fighters. During the last statistical year
   men of the American navy lost 141,387 days' sickness from a small group
   of absolutely preventable diseases contracted by sin. This means that
   every day throughout the year there are 456 men disabled by this
   disgraceful malady. In the navy of 1915 there were admitted for
   treatment for venereal diseases 112 persons in every 1,000, and in the
   army 84 for every 1,000. In civil life the number afflicted is quite as
   large proportionately as in the military service. It has been printed
   that Hecht of Vienna, stated that at one time the equivalent of three
   entire Austrian divisions of 60,000 men was under treatment for
   venereal diseases, while the German army in Belgium, representing only
   a small part of the total German forces, is reported during the first
   five months of its occupation to have furnished 35,000 such patients.
   Canadian and Australian officers have deplored the ravages of this
   disease. The late figures from the British army gave 78,000 cases, and
   all other countries have also been weakened." Surely such appalling
   figures as these, furnished by so eminent an authority, declare plainly
   that the "Perilous Times" of the "last days" are upon us! Does some one
   ask, What will be the outcome? We answer, the same as of old. God still
   lives and reigns, and just as surely as He destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah
   for similar wickedness, so surely shall He pour out His indignation and
   wrath upon the present generation of evil-doers. Yea, He has already
   begun to do so, and this leads us to consider--

  5. The Overturning which is visible on every hand.

   "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it shall be no more, until
   He come whose right it is" (Ezek. 21:27). In close accord with this
   prophecy through Ezekiel is the word recorded in Haggai 2:6, 7--"For
   thus saith the Lord of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I
   will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.
   And I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall
   come." Note carefully the coupling of these two things together--the
   coming of the Desire of all nations (the Lord Jesus), and the shaking
   of all nations. Surely this is just what we see going on before our
   eyes today! Verily, God is now "shaking" and "overturning" everything
   that is on the earth. What has been the watchword and catchword that
   has rung in our ears during the last decade? Reform! Reform! Reform!
   Governments must be reformed. Churches must be reformed. Creeds must be
   reformed. The Bible must be reformed, and conformed to "modern
   thought." Schools must be reformed. Everything must be reformed. The
   marriage-laws and divorce-laws must be reformed and deformed. What does
   all this indicate? Nothing is any longer right.

   This demand for reform is not merely local, it is not confined to some
   cotery of enthusiasts. It is worldwide. It is enveloping the earth. It
   has swept over Europe and across this continent, and has now reached
   the lethargic East. In Turkey and Egypt, in Japan and China, in
   Mesopotamia and India, in Asia and Africa, peoples who have been
   stagnant for centuries are now aroused, and the cry is going
   forth--Down with the old regime; Down with ancient institutions. Down
   with everything which brooks restraint. Never before were such
   conflicting forces at work. Never before were the foundations of
   society so seriously threatened. "I will shake all nations"--surely the
   appointed time for this is now here. "I will overturn, overturn,
   overturn"--truly this is exactly what God is doing today. Revolution is
   in the air, but those who are able to read the Signs of the Times can
   see that revolution is moving rapidly toward dissolution, the
   dissolution of the old order. Closely connected with the overturning of
   ancient institutions we may consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. The present Distress of Nations.

   "And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
   stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea
   and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them with fear, and for
   looking after those things which are coming to pass on the earth: for
   the powers of heaven shall be shaken" (Luke 21:25, 26). As we have
   already remarked more than once, prophecy invariably has a double
   fulfillment at least, and so we believe it is with the one just quoted.
   Directly, it has reference to conditions that will prevail during the
   Great Tribulation which immediately precedes the return of the Lord to
   the earth itself, but there is much to be said in favor of giving this
   prediction a present-day application. It agrees exactly with the
   conditions which now exist. Mark five of the characteristics here
   enumerated:--

   First, "Distress of nations." How well these words describe the
   well-nigh universal groaning and anguish of mankind! "Distress" is now
   no longer confined to any one people but is international and
   earth-wide in its reach. The "distress" and suffering caused by the
   exorbitant cost of living when it is becoming more and more difficult
   to secure even the bare necessaries of life. The "distress" occasioned
   by increasing taxation and the accumulation of national debts which
   must prove intolerable burdens for future generations to bear. The
   "distress" caused by shortage of fuel and food-stuffs so that one half
   of the world is living upon short rations. The "distress" of
   bereavement which is now in millions of homes which mourn the loss of
   loved ones slain in battle.

   Second, "with perplexity." Statesmen unable to discover any way out of
   present difficulties. Men of Solomonic astuteness at their wits' end,
   fearful of what they see approaching and powerless to hinder and
   prevent it. Problems between capital and labor becoming more acute and
   insoluble. Situations arising which the wisest of our statesmen,
   despite all our boasted enlightenment and progress, are unable to cope
   with successfully. "Perplexity" by reason of political corruption,
   economic agitations, and revolutionary troubles.

   Third, "the sea and the waves roaring." In Scripture, the sea is used
   to figure the peoples of the earth which, away from God, know no rest.
   Like the sea, the masses today are in a seething turmoil. Everywhere
   there is fermentation and dissatisfaction. When were human politics so
   confused, so contradictory, so threatening as they are now? When was
   law so utterly impotent to restrain the violent passions of men? Every
   day brings new indications of disquietude and convulsion. Every
   government on earth is being shaken to its very foundations. Mark the
   political changes which almost weekly take place in the great world
   powers. The time for listless indifference is gone. No longer may we
   quietly fold our hands and take our ease. There is among the nations a
   spirit of restlessness, insubordination, anarchy; a consuming desire to
   overthrow every established system which has made for law and order; a
   spirit and desire which is too deeply rooted, too furious, too general,
   to be long withstood. It is something more than a passing tumult or the
   frenzy of an hour. Every day it is gathering strength and ere long it
   will burst every bound that legislation can devise. The waves of human
   passion are rising higher, and higher and threaten to swamp the
   landmarks of the ancients and take possession of the whole earth.

   Fourth, "Men's hearts failing them with fear, and for looking for those
   things which are coming on the earth." We live in a day of
   unprecedented agitation and unparalleled tribulation. Conditions on
   earth have now reached such a pass that no human skill an steer clear
   of the mighty maelstrom which is rapidly drawing all nations within its
   awful whirl. Human society is becoming panic-stricken. Heart failure
   both physically and morally is seizing thousands of victims. Little
   wonder that suicides are increasing at such an alarming rate. Men's
   hearts are "failing them." And well they may. Confidence between man
   and man has disappeared. Friendships have become barren formalities,
   little more than selfish conveniences. Human compassion is no more.
   Conscience is dead, and men are giving up in hopeless despair as they
   discern still worse evils presaged by present-day conditions. Feverish
   eyes are moving to and fro in dread expectation of the approaching
   total collapse of civilization.

   Fifth, "the powers of heaven shall be shaken." In Scripture the powers
   of nature are frequently used symbolically. "Mountains" figure
   "Kingdoms" (Dan. 2:35; Jer. 51:25); "waters" represent "peoples" (Rev
   17:11); and the sun, moon, and stars, typify human governments (Rev.
   12:1). In the Great Tribulation the physical "powers of heaven will be
   literally"shaken," but we take it that the present-day application of
   our text is to be regarded symbolically, having reference to human
   governments. And when were the political heavens so "shaken" as they
   are today? Note the development of the "Young Turk" Party in Turkey.
   Mark the growing popularity of a revolutionary Socialism. Witness the
   revolution in Portugal, and the yet more recent revolutions in Mexico,
   China and Russia. Ancient dynasties are being overthrown; thrones are
   tottering; kingdoms are being broken up. The very cement by which human
   society has been welded together is corroded so that Civilization is
   now like walls without mortar--ready to fall to pieces.

   What is the message voiced by these universal conditions? What do they
   say to the children of God? The answer to these questions is found in
   the same passage where these things are described--"And when these
   things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for
   your redemption draweth nigh"(Luke 21:28). Let us next consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. The conflict between Capital and Labor.

   "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
   come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth
   eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be
   a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye
   have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of
   the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept
   back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are
   entered into the ears of the Lord of sabbath. Ye have lived in pleasure
   on the earth and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a
   day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and He doth
   not resist you. Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the
   Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
   earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and
   the latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the
   coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Grudge not one against another,
   brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the Judge standeth before the
   door" (James 5:1-9).

   Observe that the above passage makes express reference to "the last
   days" (vs. 3). It tells us that in these "last days" there shall be a
   class of "rich men" (vs. 1). It speaks of them having "heaped treasure
   together" (vs. 3). It declares that their riches have been acquired by
   "fraud" (vs. 4). It makes mention of them having "condemned and killed
   the just" (vs. 6). It intimates that their rapacity and dishonesty will
   evoke and provoke a loud "cry" (vs. 4) from their victims. It denounces
   them for having "lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton" (vs.
   5). It pictures the sorrows and anguish brought upon the laboring
   classes whose cries have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts
   (vs. 4). It announces the terrible judgments of heaven which shall yet
   descend upon them for their crimes, and predicts that they shall "weep
   and howl for the miseries that shall come upon them" (vs. 1).

   What human wisdom could have delineated so faithfully the present
   conflict between capital and labor! What mortal mind could have
   foretold, almost two thousand years beforehand, the amazing and
   heart-rending situation that is now before our eyes. Who but men "moved
   by the Holy Spirit" could have foreseen the recent rise of
   multi-millionaires, the accumulation and concentration of three fourths
   of the wealth of the world in the hands of scarcely one hundred men,
   the hoarded riches of the capitalist and monopolist, the extravagant
   and voluptuous living of the wealthy, the suffering which should be
   brought upon the laborer by the rapacity of his merciless employer! How
   remarkable is this prophecy in view of our twentieth century trusts and
   syndicates which corner the markets, hoard up raw materials, and rob
   the masses by fixing extortionate prices! And what is the significance
   of these things? They are another proof that the end of the age is
   reached. They are further intimation that the "last days" are upon us.
   The cries of the distressed poor have reached heaven, and the Divine
   Judge is just about to come to the deliverance of His people and deal
   in vengeance with those who have robbed them. The Lord's people are not
   to resist and fight: the command is "Grudge not one against another,
   brethren, lest ye be condemned." Believers are here urged to stablish
   their hearts and be patient, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."
   We turn now to consider.
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. The Rejuvenation and Restoration of Israel.

   The Jew has been termed the mystery and miracle of history. Terrible
   have been the privations and persecutions which he has suffered and yet
   has he survived them all. For two thousand years Israel has been a
   homeless wanderer among the nations and yet has he preserved his
   individuality. Sore have been the Divine judgments inflicted upon him
   and yet God has not made a full end of Jacob's children.

   In other chapters we have called attention to some of the numerous
   prophecies in both the Old and New Testaments which announce the
   revival of Israel, their return to Palestine, and their restoration to
   God's favor, and ere pointing out the manner in which some of these
   predictions are beginning to receive their fulfillment, we would quote
   just one other. In Matt. 24:32, 33 we have a part of our Lord's answer
   to the disciples' questions--"What shall be the sign of Thy coming and
   of the end of the age?" Here our Lord says, "Now learn a parable of the
   fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye
   know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these
   things, know that He (margin) is near, even at the doors." The fig-tree
   symbolizes the nation of Israel--compare Matt. 21:19 etc. The putting
   forth of its leaves after the long winter of dispersion among and
   subjugation to the Gentiles, points to the reinvigoration of this
   ancient people. The taking on of new life by Israel is a sure sign that
   the return of the Redeemer is near at hand.

   That the Fig-tree has begun to put forth leaves is evident to all who
   are acquainted with the leading events of the day. God is once more
   placing the Jew before the eyes of the men as those by whom He has
   blessed the world in the past and through whom He has purposed to bless
   it in the future. In a most noticeable manner the Jew is today
   commanding the attention of both the church and the world. Until the
   last fifty years the Jew had no place on our missionary program, but
   now we behold "Missions to the Jews" springing up in many lands. Others
   besides Christians are interested: the future of Palestine is being
   carefully pondered by all the leading diplomats. In every realm the Jew
   is pushing to the front. More and more his rights and claims are being
   recognized, and as he is allowed to enjoy common privileges he is
   making his mark in all the leading professions and arts: many of our
   most influential positions are now filled by the descendants of
   Abraham, and it is well known that they control the fiances of the
   world.

   Perhaps the most significant and portentous episode in Israel's history
   since their dispersion was the formation of the "Zionist Society." The
   Zionist movement has for its aim the return of the Jews to Palestine,
   and for its ultimate object the purchase of the Holy Land. During the
   past twenty years this movement has spread with startling rapidity.
   "All over the earth societies have been formed, bodies have been
   legally incorporated, and vast sums of money subscribed. Children are
   being taught that the day of Israel is at hand, and are speeding the
   ancient word "Zion" from lip to lip" (Haldeman). At the time the War
   began, there were upwards of 100,000 Jews who had returned to the land
   of their fathers. Colonies had been established everywhere and soil
   which had lain idle for centuries was once more tilled and sown by the
   offspring of David. "The land, as foretold by Jeremiah, is being bought
   and sold at the very gates of Jerusalem. The Jew is already the
   preeminent factor in the once holy city. He controls its business and
   is the present guaranty of its prosperity. His synagogues are rising
   within the shadow of the Mohammedan mosques. His lamentations for the
   city of the ancient splendors, and his prayer for the restoration of
   the former glory, and the swift descent of an avenging Messiah, resound
   every Friday beneath the moss covered stones of Solomon's walls, where
   thousands turn their faces and weep as they contemplate the past,
   reciting the penitential Psalms, and whose same tear-wet faces shine as
   they sing of the day when Zion shall be as a garden planted of the
   Lord, and when the holy hill of the great solemnities shall be the
   place for the soles of the feet of Him who is their promised King"
   (Haldeman). If all this became possible under the Turkish government
   who shall say what shall come to pass if, as now appears most probable,
   Palestine should become a British or American protectorate! Yes, the
   rejuvenation of the Jews and their return to Palestine is one of the
   most striking Signs of the Times. It tells us that the Times of the
   Gentiles are rapidly drawing to a close. The budding of the Fig-tree
   evidences that Israel's summer is nigh at hand and that their Messiah
   is even at the doors. Let us next consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

  9. The limitations of Earth's great Week.

   We are well aware that in broaching this point we shall probably evoke
   the criticism of honored brethren and be charged with "setting a date"
   for the Return of our Lord. Nevertheless, we feel constrained to set
   down our honest convictions, only asking our readers to examine in the
   light of Holy Writ what we now advance tentatively and not
   dogmatically.

   In ancient times it was commonly held by Jewish rabbis before our
   Lord's first advent, and by many of the most eminent of the church
   fathers afterwards, that the Creation week of Genesis one defined the
   limits of earth's history. Before we proceed with our argument we shall
   first quote from three who lived in the second and third centuries, not
   that we appeal to them as authorities, but simply to show that the view
   was commonly held in the century which immediately followed the
   apostles and before the Blessed Hope was lost.

   In the thirteenth chapter of the apocryphal Epistle of Barnabas,
   written about 150 A.D., we read--"God made in six days the works of His
   hands, and He finished them the seventh day, and He rested the seventh
   day and sanctified it. Consider, my children, what this signifies: He
   finished them in six days. The meaning of it is this: that in six
   thousand years the Lord will bring all things to an end. For with Him
   one day is a thousand years, as Himself testifieth. Therefore,
   children, in six days, that is, in six thousand years--Shall all things
   be accomplished. And what is that He saith, And He rested the seventh
   day? He meaneth this: that when His Son shall come, and abolish the
   season of the wicked one, and judge the ungodly, and shall change the
   sun, moon and stars, then He shall gloriously rest in that seventh day.
   ** Behold, He will then truly sanctify it with blessed rest, when we
   (having received the righteous promise, when iniquity shall be no more,
   all things being renewed by the Lord) shall be able to sanctify it,
   being ourselves first made holy."

   Next we quote from the writings of the distinguished Irenaeus who was a
   disciple of Polycarp, who, in turn, was a disciple of John the apostle.
   It has been said that "for learning, steadfastness and zeal, he was
   amongst the most renowned of the early fathers." Consider then his
   testimony--"In whatever number of days the world was created, in the
   same number of thousands of years it will come to its consummation.
   God, on the sixth day, finished the works which He made; and God rested
   on the seventh day from all His works. This is a history of the past
   and a prophecy of the future; for a day with the Lord is as a thousand
   years." Similarly, Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, who was martyred in the
   year 258, wrote--"In the Divine arrangement of the world, seven days
   were at first employed, and in them seven thousand years were
   included."

   It may be objected to the above quotations that they are merely the
   opinions and speculations of fallible men, and that their views find no
   warrant in the Word of God. It is true that they were the beliefs of
   eminent saints, beliefs which were shared by many of God's people in
   ancient times, and it is also true that this appeal to antiquity is no
   proof of the authenticity of the view we now advocate; but to say that
   it is has no warrant in God's Word is more than we are prepared to
   admit, yea, as we shall seek to show there is not a little in the
   Scriptures which seems to countenance and confirm it.

   First, we would appeal to the Septenary system of the sacred calendar
   of Israel. Here we cannot do better than quote from the late Dr.
   Johnson--"Through the whole Scripture, both of the Old and New
   Testaments, there is a striking typical representation of some great
   and important Sabbath, as a great septenary that has not yet taken
   place, and which evidently appears to be the Millenarian Septenary, as
   the great Sabbath of the whole earth. God blessed the seventh day, and
   hallowed it. In the Decalogue this peculiar distinguishment of the
   seventh day, or weekly sabbath, was most solemnly renewed. Every
   seventh year was appointed a sabbatical year. And the commencement of
   the year of jubilee which was every fiftieth year, was to be fixed by
   the running of a septenary of sabbatical years. "Thou shalt number
   seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years, and the
   space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine
   years" (Lev. 25:8). The number seven, because used in Scripture to
   complete all the sacred divisions of times, was regarded by the Jews as
   the symbol of perfection, and is used in this sense in Scripture. The
   question then arises, Is it to be supposed that all these events, which
   are interwoven with the Mosaic dispensation, which was itself
   symbolical or typical, and which are introduced into the New Testament,
   and abound so much in the Book of Revelation, have no antetype to
   correspond to them?--no great sabbatical septenary to which they all
   point and in which they all shall be accomplished? Is it not highly
   probable that they are all typical of the seventh millenary of the
   earth, which is the great Sabbath?" To which we answer, we certainly
   believe so.

   Second; God is a God of order. In Scripture, in creation and in
   history, we find innumerable evidences that God works according to a
   mathematical plan. Numerical design is stamped upon all His handiwork.
   This fact is so freely recognized that we need not pause to illustrate.
   What we would now ask is, Is it likely that in His great dispensational
   plan He has departed from His general rule? We cannot believe it. But
   we are not left to bare conjecture. That part of God's age plan which
   is already before us gives plain intimation that He who knows the end
   from the beginning and has "framed the ages" (Heb. 1:2-Greek) has
   appointed symmetrical lines to the main divisions and the limits of the
   world's history. From Adam to Abraham there were two thousand years.
   From Abraham to the Divine incarnation there was another two thousand
   years. May there not be another two thousands years then between the
   first and the second advents? We firmly believe there will be. God's
   ways in the past foreshadow His dealings in the future, for He changeth
   not. That the proportions of the present dispensation will correspond
   with the preceding two great divisions of the world's time we shall
   seek to demonstrate in our next argument.

   Third; we would here call attention to a statement made in connection
   with the resurrection of Lazarus. In John 11:6, 7 we learn that "When
   He had heard therefore that he (Lazarus) was sick, He abode two days
   still in the same place where He was. Then after that saith He to His
   disciples, Let us go into Judea again." Why are we told the exact
   length of time our Lord remained away from Judea after that He received
   word of Lazarus' sickness? There must be some good reason for the
   record of this fact. There is nothing superfluous or meaningless in
   God's Word. We believe that there is a deeper meaning to this than
   appears on the surface. Before we suggest what this meaning is, let us
   note another important word in this connection. In John 11:17 we read
   "Then when Jesus came, He found that he (Lazarus) had lain in the grave
   four days already." Again, we ask, Why this information concerning the
   precise number of days that Lazarus had lain in the grave? Is the
   answer far to seek? Did not Lazarus typify the condition of man at that
   time?--the time of the first advent, the time "when Jesus came." In
   what condition did the Son of God find the one who had been made in His
   own image? He found him dead--dead in trespasses and sins. And how long
   had man been in this state? According to God's estimate of time--a
   thousand years as a day--exactly four days, for there can be little
   doubt that from Adam to Christ was just that length of time. Here then
   is the key to the "two days" of verse 6. Lazarus not only represented
   the natural man in his spiritually dead condition, but as the one whom
   "Jesus loved" he typified the nation of Israel, and just as Christ,
   after abiding for two days outside the land, said "Let us go into Judea
   again" and there, and then, raised Lazarus, so after two thousand years
   absence from the earth, our Lord shall return to Judea and restore
   Israel to life. "A fanciful supposition" says someone. Not at all, is
   our reply. Our conclusion is in perfect harmony with the express
   testimony of Scripture. Listen, "After two days will He revive us: in
   the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight"
   (Hosea 6:2)!

   If further proof be required to show that our Lord will be absent from
   the earth "two days" (two thousand years) we have another typical hint
   in John 4:43, 45--"Now after two days He departed thence, and went into
   Galilee. ** Then when He was come into Galilee, the Galileans received
   Him," and then follows the record of the healing of the nobleman's son.
   Who can fail to see in this dispensational picture which will be
   realized in the millennium! As John 11 presents our Lord's return to
   Judea after an interval of "two days" which is followed, typically, by
   the restoration of Israel, so here, in John 4, after "two days" our
   Lord comes into Galilee "of the Gentiles" which is followed, typically,
   by their "healing"! The same time-mark is found in John 2:1. It was on
   the third day" - after "two days" that "there was a marriage in Cana of
   Galilee," where the wine (symbol of joy, see Ps. 104:15) is provided by
   Christ--the "best" kept till "the last" and where He "manifested forth
   His glory" (vs. 11)--how perfect the type!--which clearly pictures
   another millennial scene, and this also is on "the third day"--the
   "third" after two days absence from the earth! Still other
   illustrations might be adduced but these are sufficient. "Four days"
   from Adam to the first advent, "two days" of absence, making a total of
   six (6,000 years) and then the Lord returns to usher in the "seventh
   day," the Millennium, when the sick will be healed, the dead raised,
   the wine provided, and the glory of Christ fully manifested.

   Fourth; in 2 Pet. 3:8 we read, "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this
   one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
   thousand years as one day." Two things here are to be particularly
   noted. First, the immediate context of these words directly connects
   them with the second advent of Christ! In verses 3 and 4 the apostle
   tells us that in the last days "scoffers" should ask, "Where is the
   promise of His coming?" to which they add, "for since the fathers fell
   asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
   creation." The force of this is obvious: men will point to the world
   around and declare that everything is stable and prosperous, refusing
   to see any indications of the approaching doom of Christendom. In reply
   the apostle declares, "For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by
   the Word of God the heavens which were of old, and the earth standing
   out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then was,
   being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth,
   which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire
   against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men." Having
   silenced the objection of the "scoffers," the apostle now addresses
   himself to the saints, saying, "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this
   one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
   thousand years as a day. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise,
   as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to usward, not
   willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
   repentance." Thus we see that these words are directly connected with
   the subject of our Lord's return. In the second place, observe the
   words, "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing." The "be not
   ignorant" is in apposition to the "this they (the "scoffers") willingly
   are ignorant of" (vs. 5). The "this one thing" calls attention to the
   importance of what he was about to say. God forbid that His people
   today should be "willingly ignorant of" what He has been pleased to
   make known to us. If, then, Scripture distinctly tells us that "one day
   is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day,"
   are we not fully justified in concluding that the six days' work of
   Genesis one foreshadowed six thousand years of human toil and labor,
   and that the seventh day, the Sabbath, which God "blessed" and
   "sanctified" and on which He "rested from all His work" typified that
   dispensation of blessing which shall follow the six thousand years of
   human effort, a dispensation over which the Prince of Peace shall
   preside, and a dispensation which will last exactly "a thousand years"!

   Fifth; as we have pointed out in an earlier chapter, the
   Transfiguration upon the holy mount was a seventh day scene. Matthew
   says, "And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
   brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, and was
   transfigured before them" (Matt. 17:1, 2). Luke says, "And it came to
   pass about an eight days after these sayings. He took Peter and John
   and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. And as He prayed, the
   fashion of His countenance was altered, and His rainment was white and
   glistering" (Luke 9:28, 29). Why these time-marks? The
   "transfiguration" was a spectacular setting forth of the leading
   features and characteristics of the millennial kingdom, and the fact
   that the Gospels present this as a seventh day scene certainly seems to
   add weight to the conclusion that the Millennium will follow six
   thousand years (six days) of human toil and labor, and thus be the
   antitypical fulfillment of the seventh day of Gen. 2:3.

   Sixth; the Millennium is distinctly termed "a Sabbath-keeping"--Heb.
   4:9.

   Seventh, whatever may be thought of what we have advanced above,
   personally, we know of nothing whatever in Scripture which contradicts
   it. It is true that Acts 1:7 is often appealed to but it is clear from
   1 Thess. 5:1-7 that it will not bear the construction that is
   frequently placed upon it. We may be considered "fanciful," but if so,
   we are fanciful in company with a goodly and godly number--"Luther
   entertained it. Melancthon wrote it on the fly-leaf of his Bible, as a
   matter not to be disputed. Thousands of divines since his time have
   received it as part of their faith. And when we come, to place together
   certain statements of the Scriptures, there seems to me to be a weight
   of testimony in its favor sufficient to warrant us in regarding it as
   sacred truth. Look at these sentences:--

   "In six days the Lord made heaven and earth."

   "On the seventh day He rested and was refreshed."

   "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years."

   "There remaineth therefore a keeping of Sabbath to the people of God."
   (Quoted from "The Last Times" by J. A. Seiss).

   What then is the practical value of this computation? This, that it
   furnishes us with another proof that the coming of the Lord draweth
   nigh. No doubt there is Divine design about the present confusion in
   human chronology. It is impossible for us to ascertain with certainty
   the precise year of grace in which we are now living. But it is almost
   certain, as certain as any human calculation can be, that the year 5900
   A.M. was passed considerably more than a decade ago, and therefore less
   than a century is now required to complete the sixth millennium. The
   end of the sixth day is nigh at hand, and as we know that the
   Tribulation period which follows the Rapture will last at least seven
   years and probably much longer, then the descent of Christ into the air
   to catch up His saints to Himself is that much nearer still. Let it be
   distinctly understood that the period of "two days" when our Lord is
   absent, has to do with His absence from the earth and that His coming
   back to the earth at the close of the 6000 years to usher in the
   Millennium follows some years after the first stage of His second
   advent, so that in no sense are we "fixing a date" for the coming of
   Christ for His saints--the date of that event is absolutely "hidden in
   God." Yet, as we say, we know that the approximate time this must be
   very near, because at the close of the present century (and how far
   this century has progressed we cannot say for certain) the Millennium
   itself will begin, and before that arrives there is the Tribulation
   period which may last forty or even seventy years. Consider now--
     __________________________________________________________________

  10. The analogy between the two Advents of Christ.

   That there will be a close analogy between the first and second Advents
   of our Lord is intimated by two Scriptures which contain a similar
   expression. In Gal. 4:4 we read, "When the fullness of time was come
   God sent forth His Son, born of a woman." This, of course, has
   reference to the first advent. In Eph. 1:10 we are told "that in the
   dispensation of the fullness of times H might gather together in one
   all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth;
   even in Him." This has reference to that which shall immediately follow
   the second advent. The Millennium will be "the Dispensation of the
   fullness of times" inasmuch as it will be the final one of earth's
   Ages. The "gathering together in one all things in Christ, both which
   are in heaven, and which are on earth" points to the uniting of
   heaven's and earth's interests under His blessed reign. Then will be
   fulfilled that word of John 1:51--"Hereafter ye shall see heaven open,
   and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man,"
   for then will perfect communication be established between heaven and
   earth, or rather, earth and heaven. In order to understand the force of
   this expression "fullness of times" let us ponder the words "fullness
   of time" (Gal. 4:4) in the light of the conditions which prevailed at
   the Divine incarnation.

   The coming of Christ to this earth was not some sudden, isolated,
   unexpected event. The advent of our blessed Lord, and with it the dawn
   of Christianity, marked a climax and a consummation. The world was
   prepared through long processes for the coming of the one and the
   preaching of the other. From Paradise to Bethlehem the centuries were
   preparing for the appearing of Emmanuel. As the processes of creation
   prepared the earth for man, so all history prepared the way for the
   birth of the Saviour. The Holy Scriptures focus the preparation in one
   race, but all peoples shared in the process. Outside of the elect, God
   was at work, and all streams converged to one center.

   If we look closely at the character of the age when Christ was born, we
   may, in some measure at least, understand the "fullness" of which Gal.
   4:4 makes mention. It consisted chiefly in two things - preparation and
   need. There was a wonderful combination of circumstances tending to
   prepare the world for the Gospel, and a terrible climax in the world's
   need of redemption. The break up of old heathen faiths and the passing
   away of the prejudices of antiquity disposed men for a new revelation
   which was spiritual, humane and universal. The utter failure of Pagan
   religion from its immorality, and of pagan philosophy from its
   impotency to cure that immorality and the misery which accompanied it,
   called loudly for some fresh faith which should be both pure and
   powerful.

   The century immediately preceding our Lord's advent was probably the
   most remarkable in all history. Everything was in a state of
   transition. Old things were passing away and there seemed little
   prospect that they would give birth to a better and brighter future.
   The fruit of the ancient order was rotting upon the tree without
   yielding the seeds of a new order. And yet there were strange rumors of
   coming relief afloat, and singular hopes stirred the hearts of men that
   some Great One was to appear and renovate the world. But to
   particularize--

   The world had reached its climacteric of sin.

   History has given a faithful record of the terrible moral conditions
   which obtained among men in the century which immediately preceded our
   Lord's appearing. At Rome, which was then the metropolis of the world,
   the Court of Caesar was steeped in luxury and licentiousness. To
   provide amusement for his senators, six hundred gladiators fought a
   hand to hand conflict in the public theater. Not to be outdone, Pompey
   turned five hundred lions into the arena to engage an equal number of
   his braves, and delicate ladies (?) sat applauding and gloating over
   the flow of blood that followed. At this period children were the
   property of the State, to be disposed of as was deemed best for the
   public interests. Weak and sickly infants were looked upon as a useless
   encumbrance and generally suffered an early and cruel death. The aged
   and infirm were often banished to an island of the Tiber, there to
   starve out their few remaining days. Marriage, if such this holy
   institution could then be called, was wholly a matter of sensual
   caprice. Divorces were so common and frequent that it became the custom
   for women to count them by the number of rings worn on their fingers.
   Almost two-thirds of the population of the entire civilized (?) world
   were computed to have been slaves. Those who were in this unhappy
   situation were treated with the utmost cruelty. Their masters had
   absolute power over them and were permitted to scourge or put them to
   death at pleasure. This right was exercised in the most merciless
   manner. When punished capitally slaves were generally crucified. So
   wretched was the lot of mankind that the sanest of the philosophers of
   that time calmly advocated suicide as the best way of escape from the
   miseries of life.

   Conditions in Greece were even worse. Sensual indulgence and every
   species of cruelty were carried to the highest pitch. Eating, or we
   should say, gluttony, became the chief occupation, everything being
   ransacked to gratify the appetite. Fornication was indulged without
   restraint. Parents were at liberty to expose their children to perish
   with cold and hunger or to be eaten up by wild beasts. Such exposure
   was frequently practiced and passed without punishment or censure. Wars
   were carried on with the utmost ferocity. If any of the vanquished
   escaped death slavery of the most abject kind was the only prospect
   before them and in consequence death was considered preferable to
   capture. The nature of their conflicts then can well be imagined. The
   Greeks commonly sacrificed their captives at the tombs of their heroes.
   With what truth then did the Scriptures declare that, "the dark places
   of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty"!

   We say then, the world had reached its climacteric of sin. Often-times
   a disease cannot be treated until it comes to a head.' In view of the
   above conditions surely the world was ready for the appearing of the
   Great Physician, and surely we can now discover a deeper meaning in the
   words, "When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His Son."

   The world had reached its consummation of Want.

   It had been predicted of old that the Messiah should be "the Desire of
   all nations," and to this end there must be a complete exposure of the
   failure of all human plans of deliverance. This time had fully come
   when Christ was born. Never before had the abject misery and need of
   men been so apparent and so extensive. Philosophy had lost its power to
   satisfy men, and the old religions were dead.

   The Greeks and Romans, stood at the head of the nations at the time our
   Lord appeared on the earth, and the religious state of these people in
   that age is too well known to require any lengthy description from us.
   Without exception all were idolaters. The fundamental truth of the
   Unity of God was held by the Jews alone. Among the heathen, Polytheism
   and Pantheism were the popular concepts. Innumerable deities were
   worshipped and to these deities were attributed the most abominable
   characteristics. Pagan worshipers represented their gods as guilty of
   drunkenness, thefts, quarrels and incest. Mercury was a thief; Bacchus
   a drunkard; Venus was a harlot; and Saturn murdered his own children.
   The worship of their devotees entirely correspond with the characters
   their gods bore. Human sacrifices were frequently offered upon their
   altars.

   Among the Romans, infidelity and atheism were rampant. The altars were
   forsaken and the temples were deserted. The general skepticism of his
   countrymen seems to have been voiced by the bitter words of
   Pilate--"What is truth?"

   Judaism was also fully ripe for the accomplishment of ancient prophecy.
   Sadduceeism had leavened the ruling classes and afflicted the whole
   nation with rationalism. Phariseeism, which represented the ideas and
   ideals of the popular party, was too often only formal and
   hypocritical, and at best was cold and hard "binding heavy burdens" and
   laying on men's shoulders a load which they refused to touch with their
   fingers (Matt. 23:4). The Jewish people were under the government of
   Rome and were thoroughly dejected. Was there then no eye to pity, no
   arm to save? Was God unmindful of the tragic conditions of mankind? No;
   blessed be His name. The "fullness of time" had now come. Earth's
   fields were "white unto harvest." A platform was erected on which the
   glories of God's grace might be exhibited. His own blessed Son now
   appeared among men and the glorious Gospel was proclaimed far and wide.
   The "fullness of time," then, spoke of ripeness of opportunity and
   consummation of need.

   History repeats itself. As it was in connection with the first advent
   so it is concerning the second. Just as there was a definite and
   unmistakable movement in all history preparing the way for the
   Dispensation of Grace, so is there a similar one going on now making
   ready the world for the Millennium. Just as the world's urgent need was
   fully demonstrated before the Saviour appeared among men, so shall it
   also be ere He comes back as the Prince of Peace to take the government
   upon His shoulder. And to those who have "understanding of the times,"
   to those whose eyes are not blinded by the glare of a false and foolish
   optimism, it is evident that the "fullness of times" is rapidly drawing
   nigh, yea, that it is already almost upon us.

   History is repeating itself. Conditions in the world today more closely
   resemble those which obtained just before the first coming of Christ,
   than have those of any other generation since then. Today the same
   luxury and licentiousness; the same skepticism and credulity; the same
   coldness and formality among those who profess to be God's people; the
   same lack of natural affection toward children and disrespect for the
   aged; the same military spirit and lust for blood, followed now by the
   enslaving of the conquered--deportation of the Belgians. The need of
   the world for a competent and righteous Ruler was never so apparent as
   now. The "Dispensation of the fullness of times" must be at hand. As
   all History prepared the world for our Lord's first advent, so it is
   now "making straight His way" for His second coming, when He shall be
   seen not in a manger but on a throne of Glory; not as the victim, but
   as the Victor.

   But we must restrain our pen and conclude in few words. We have
   examined many Scriptures, we have listened to the evidence of numerous
   witnesses, we have compared sundry and independent lines of prophecy,
   and we have found that they harmonize in their testimony, that they are
   mutually corroborative, that each sustains the truthfulness of the
   others, that singly and unitedly they affirm with voice loud and clear
   "the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh!" Never before did the Church of
   God gaze upon such a constellation of Signs attesting the near approach
   of the Redeemer, as it does today. Never before was there such
   unmistakable demonstration that this Gospel age is rapidly drawing to a
   close. Never before was there such reason for the sinner to heed that
   word "Seek ye the Lord while He may be found; Call ye upon Him while He
   is near." And never before was there such urgent need for believers to
   obey that admonition--"Let your loins be girded about, and your lights
   burning: and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord"(Luke
   12:36, 37). The Bridegroom cometh! Then trim your lamps and go forth to
   meet Him.

                   The Beneficiaries of the Redeemer's Return

                                       or

                            The Scope of the Rapture


   "The coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with

   all His saints" (1 Thess. 3:13).

   We come now to a phase of our subject which has given rise to much
   controversy. Sad it is that the "Blessed Hope" should have been an
   occasion for contention. But, just as men have divided into different
   camps over every fundamental doctrine of Scripture, so have sides been
   taken in regard to various points which bear upon our Lord's Return.
   Alas! "What is man?" Surely "an enemy hath done this." One of the
   points upon which Bible teachers and students are divided is that of
   the scope of the Rapture. Some have taught that at our Lord's descent
   into the air all of His saints will be caught up to meet Him; while
   others insist that only a small part of the Church will be removed from
   the earth at that time--that part which is obedient, faithful,
   spiritual. Thus, translation to heaven at the second coming of Christ
   is made a matter of merit and reward.

   What saith the Scriptures? Do they teach a partial or a total rapture
   of the Church which is Christ's body? Do they declare that all
   believers will be removed from earth at the time our Lord descends from
   His Father's throne, or, that only a few of them will? Clearly, they
   cannot teach both, and surely a matter of such moment is not left
   indeterminable. We cannot believe that a question of such importance is
   left an open one. Yet, we are not unmindful of the fact that the
   advocates of each position referred to above, appeal to the Word in
   support of their views. But just here we would ask, Are the Scriptures
   pressed into service really relevant to the point at issue, and will
   they actually bear the interpretation which is given them?

   What saith the Scriptures? and particularly, What is the explicit
   teaching the the Church Epistles? If we are seeking to find the
   inspired answer to the question, Will the whole Church or only a part
   of it, escape the judgments of the Great Tribulation? then, surely, it
   is to the Church Epistles we must turn for information. We are not here
   arguing that there are no Scriptures which treat of the first stage of
   Christ' second coming outside of the Church Epistles, for doubtless
   there are--for example John 14:1-3--yet, we repeat, If the question
   before us concerns the Church, then the testimony of the Church
   Epistles must decide the dispute. If this much be granted--and
   personally we do not see why it should not--then the range of our
   inquiry is narrowed down and the issue is simplified. It is highly
   significant that almost all of the passages which are in dispute (as to
   interpretation) between the advocates of the conflicting schools are
   outside of the Church Epistles: in other words, the verses which are
   made the occasion for controversy are found, for the most part, in the
   Gospels, in Hebrews, or in the Apocalypse.

   To one who is a beginner in the study of Dispensational truth and is
   unacquainted with human writings upon the second coming of Christ, the
   teaching of the Church Epistles on this subject appears to be simple
   and harmonious. Those passages which deal at greatest length with the
   return of our Lord and the taking of His people to be with Himself,
   seem to set forth no limitations in regard to the number of the saints
   which shall be translated. Such expressions as, "The dead in Christ
   shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air" (1 Thess.
   4:16, 17); "They that are Christ's at His coming" (1 Cor. 15:23); and
   "We shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye" (1
   Cor. 15:51); certainly appear to teach the rapture of the entire
   Church, and, ought not we be very slow to accept any conflicting line
   of teaching which would compel us to abandon the obvious meaning of
   these verses, and instead, have to give them a strained interpretation
   so as to harmonize them with something which is foreign to their plain
   signification? Yea, is it not evident that any system of teaching which
   would compel us to do this carries with it its own condemnation?

   What then saith the Scriptures and what is the testimony of the Church
   Epistles? The present writer believes there can be only one answer to
   this question, namely, that every member of Christ's body will be
   raptured at the time our great Head comes to conduct His blood-bought
   people to His Father's House. We believe this, not only because a
   number of Scriptures expressly affirm it, but also because some of the
   great basic principles which underlie both the Gospel, and what is
   known as "Church truth," demand this conclusion and repudiate the other
   alternative. We would now humbly submit to the prayerful and careful
   attention of our readers some of the grounds for our belief in a total
   rather than in a partial rapture of the Church which, in faithfulness
   to our apprehension of God's Truth on this subject, we must denominate
   the partial-rapture theory.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. Because GRACE is that which characterizes all God's dealings with His own
  during this dispensation and grace, necessarily, eliminates all distinctions
  of personal merits.

   The advocates of the partial-rapture theory declare that only those who
   are intelligently and eagerly looking for the Lord will be caught up at
   His return. They affirm that none save those who are walking worthily
   and who are faithful to the end will be taken to be with the Lord when
   He descends into the air, and that only such, will, subsequently,
   "reign" with Him during the millennial era. They teach that all
   un-spiritual believers will be left behind on earth to suffer the
   judgments of the Great Tribulation. As a consequence, not a few of the
   Lord's people have been harassed and distressed, fearful lest they
   should be among the number who are rejected by the Lord at His coming.
   We are told that none but those who attain some high standard of
   spirituality will be raptured, but when we ask for a precise definition
   of this standard none can enlighten us; when we inquire, How faithful
   and how worthy we must be in order to be among the select company who
   shall be taken to the Father's House, none can give us a satisfactory
   reply. Hence, instead of the Return of our Lord being a blessed hope it
   becomes a source of bewilderment and anxiety.

   It appears to the writer that there is one Scripture which simply and
   satisfactorily disposes of every objection which can be brought against
   the affirmation that the entire Body of Christ will be raptured at the
   appearing of our great Head. We refer to 2 Thess. 2:16--"Now our Lord
   Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us,
   and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through
   grace." Here we learn that the "Hope" which has been given to God's
   people in this Age, like every other blessing we enjoy, is "a good hope
   through grace," hence, all questions of worthiness, merit, desert, are
   forever ruled out. Let us settle it once for all that the Dispensation
   in which we are living is a unique one, that it is fundamentally
   different from all that have preceded it and from that which is to
   follow it--the Millennium. This is the Dispensation of Grace, and grace
   obliterates all distinctions, grace eliminates all questions of merits;
   grace makes every blessing a Divine and free gift. But, the human heart
   is essentially legalistic. Man wishes to have a hand in his own
   salvation and desires to contribute something to the price of his
   redemption. When, by grace, the Holy Spirit has taught a soul that the
   Finished Work of Christ is the sole ground of our justification before
   God, when he has learnt from the Scripture of Truth that the Blood of
   the Cross cannot be plussed by anything from the creature, then it is
   that the Enemy comes to that heart and seeks to disturb its peace and
   rob it of the liberty wherewith it has been made free, by insisting
   that faith in Christ merely puts us in a salvable condition, that
   believing the Gospel simply places us on an extended probation, and
   that only if we obey God's commands and walk worthily before Him shall
   we be taken to Heaven at the close of our earthly pilgrimage. This is
   Law mingled with Grace; thus is the precious Blood supplemented by
   human works. Instead of realizing that good works flow from a heart
   that is filled with gratitude to God and which are constrained by the
   love of Christ, the believer is led to believe that good works must be
   performed by him as a condition of his eternal salvation. But, even
   when the believer has been delivered from this error, the legalistic
   tendency of the human heart still seeks an outlet, and in our day it is
   manifested in reference to the Blessed Hope of the believer. The saints
   are now taught that their Rapture and Glorification are not "through
   grace" but will be the result of personal effort and attainment. Thus
   does the leaven of legalism work to the robbing of God of His glory and
   the believer of his peace.

   Again we say, let us settle it once for all that we are living in the
   Dispensation of Grace (John 1:17; Eph. 3:2) and that every blessing we
   enjoy is a gift of Divine clemency. We are justified by grace (Rom.
   3:24). We are saved by grace (Eph. 2:8). The Holy Scriptures are termed
   "The Word of His Grace" (Acts 20:32). The Third Person of the Holy
   Trinity is denominated "The Spirit of Grace" (Heb. 10:29). God is
   seated upon a Throne of Grace (Heb. 4:16). And, the Good Hope which is
   given us is "through grace" (2 Thess. 2:16). It is all of Grace from
   first to last. It is all of Grace from beginning to end. It was grace
   that predestinated us before the world began (2 Tim. 1:9), and it will
   be grace that makes us like Christ at the consummation of our
   salvation. Thank God for such a "Blessed Hope."

  2. Because the Rapture is the CONSUMMATION OF OUR SALVATION and therefore,
  being an integral and essential part of our salvation it cannot, in anywise,
  be determined by our personal worthiness.

   Our salvation will not be complete until the Return of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. In the New Testament "salvation" is threefold in its
   scope--past, present, and future; and it is threefold in its
   character--from the penalty of sin, from the power of sin, and from the
   presence of sin. The penalty of sin is "death" (separation from God),
   and we are delivered from it because our Substitute died for us on the
   Cross--"Who His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree" (1
   Pet. 2:24). But while every believer has been completely and eternally
   saved from the penalty of sin--from the wrath to come--while it is true
   that there is no sin ON us (all our iniquities were "laid" on
   Christ--Is. 53:6), yet, sin is still IN us. The evil nature remains
   even in the one who has been born again. Yet, notwithstanding this,
   Christ also indwells each of His own people and from Him may be drawn
   grace and strength and thus, day by day, we are being saved from the
   power of sin. But we shall yet be saved from the very presence of
   sin--"For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we look for
   the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body,
   that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the
   working whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself"
   (Phil. 3:20, 21). At our Lord's return we shall be completely
   emancipated from the dominion and pollution of sin. It was this the
   apostle Paul had before him when he wrote--"And the very God of peace
   sanctify you wholly--completely, i.e. in each part of our threefold
   being--and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
   blameless unto (at) the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thess.
   5:23).

   We have thus shown that our salvation will not be consummated until the
   Return of our blessed Saviour, that not until then shall we be
   completely "conformed" to the image of God's Son (Rom. 8:29). It is not
   until Christ's second advent that the purpose of our predestination
   will be fully realized, for it is not until then we shall be
   "glorified" (Rom. 8:30). If then salvation is by grace and if Christ is
   our Saviour- our Saviour from the presence of sin as well as from its
   penalty and power--then our own works (our obedience, faithfulness,
   service, etc.) are not the determining factor, nor even a contributing
   factor. Salvation is not partly of grace and partly of works, if it
   were we should have ground for "boasting" and Christ would be robbed of
   at least a part of His glory. Once we see that the time of our Lord's
   Return is the time when our salvation is consummated, and once we see
   that salvation is by grace, through faith, and not of works, then it
   will be clear that it cannot, in anywise, be determined by our personal
   worthiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. Because to make our Rapture dependent upon anything in us is to attack the
  Finished Work of Christ.

   We do not charge the advocates of the partial-rapture theory with
   intentionally doing this, nay we are fully satisfied that most if not
   all of them would shrink back in horror from wittingly committing such
   a sin. Yet, we do say that this is the logical and actual outcome of
   their teaching. A long drawn-out argument is not needed to prove this
   after what we have said above under the first two heads. If the Rapture
   is the consummation of the application of our salvation then anything
   which makes that salvation, or any part thereof, dependent upon
   anything in or from us, necessarily attacks the Finished Work of Christ
   upon which alone our salvation rests.

   As we have already said, the Rapture is the time when Christ returns to
   conduct His blood-bought people to the Father's House (John 14:1-3).
   What then is it that gives title and fitness for the Father's House?
   Surely there can be only one answer to this question. Surely none but
   those who are ignorant of the character and contents of the Gospel of
   God would declare that our wretched works are needed to supplement the
   Cross-Work of Christ. But, blessed be God, the point we are now
   considering is not left to be determined by logical deductions, but is
   the express subject of Divine revelation. In Col. 1:12 we are exhorted
   to give thanks unto the Father "which hath made us meet to be partakers
   of the inheritance of the saints in light." The "inheritance of the
   saints in light" is not a matter of attainment as certain teachers are
   today affirming, but is an occasion of thanksgiving to God, because it
   is due solely to His grace. Observe carefully the tense of the verb
   here: it is not we are "being made meet," still less that we are making
   ourselves meet, but "which HATH made us meet." Again we ask, What is it
   that gives us title to the inheritance of the saints in light? And we
   reply, Nought but the precious blood and infinite merits of our great
   God and Saviour Jesus Christ. What was it that qualified the "Prodigal"
   for a place at the Father's table? Did he have to submit to a lengthy
   probation after he returned home and before he was permitted to feast
   with the Father? No; the "best robe"--which is the portion of every
   believer--was all that was needed. Was not the "Repentant Thief" made
   meet for the inheritance of the saints in light the same hour in which
   he believed? Unquestionably, for our Lord assured him, "Today shalt
   thou be with Me in Paradise." If then the "best robe" was all that the
   Prodigal needed to fit him for a place at the Father's table, and if
   repentance toward God and faith in our lord Jesus Christ was sufficient
   to translate the Dying Thief to Paradise, is it not clear that nothing
   further will be demanded of those whom the Lord shall conduct to the
   Father's House at the time of His Return?
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. Because the Rapture of a part of the Church only, would leave the remainder
  of it still upon the earth and that would prevent the manifestation of the Man
  of Sin.

   The picture that is presented in 2 Thess. 2 is an exceedingly solemn
   one. There we learn that the mystery of iniquity which was at work even
   in the days of the apostle Paul and which has been hindered from coming
   to complete fruition will yet head up in the appearing of the Man of
   Sin, the Son of Perdition. The coming of this Devil-Man will be "after
   the working of Satan will all power and signs and lying wonders and
   will all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish." Then
   it will be that the Devil is allowed "free rein." Then it is that,
   through the Anit-christ, Satan will deceive the whole world. There will
   be many on earth at that time who in former days had listened unmoved
   to the preaching of the Gospel and had treated with scorn or
   indifference its gracious offers. hence, "because they loved not the
   truth, that they might be saved ** God shall send them strong delusion,
   that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who
   believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness."

   We have said above that 2 Thess. 2 pictures a time when the Devil will
   be allowed "free rein." This will be the season when all his diabolical
   scheming will attain its full development in the manifestation of the
   Son of Perdition. Today it is otherwise. In this Dispensation, satan is
   held in check, and his plans are not permitted to fully materialize.
   Today it is impossible for the Man of Sin to appear on the stage of
   this world as the above passage clearly intimates. Says the apostle,
   "Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
   things? And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may
   be revealed in his own season. For the mystery of lawlessness doth
   already work: only there is one that restraineth now until He be taken
   out of the way" (2 Thess. 2:5-7, R.V.).

   The "mystery of lawlessness" (in contrast to "the mystery of
   godliness," i.e. "God manifest in the flesh"--1 Tim. 3:16) will
   terminate in the Satanic parody of the Divine incarnation--the bringing
   forth by Satan of the Man of Sin, the Son of Perdition. This Man of Sin
   will be revealed "in his own season." That "season has not yet arrived.
   The reference is to the Great Tribulation period. There are two
   entities which are now preventing the appearing of the Anti-christ.
   They are referred to in 2 Thess. 2 as "that which restraineth" and
   there is "One that restraineth now until He be taken out of the way."
   The former is the Church which is the body of Christ; the latter is the
   Holy Spirit Himself. The Church which is indwelt and energized by the
   Holy Spirit is now hindering and preventing the full development of the
   Mystery of Lawlessness and the consequent appearing of the Lawless One.
   Not until the whole of the Church and the Holy Spirit leave this
   earth("until He be taken out of the way") can the Man of Sin appear.

   Here then is a simple but conclusive argument which all should be able
   to grasp. Passing by the question of--How would it be possible for the
   Holy Spirit to be "taken our of the way" while many of those whom He
   indwells are left behind on the earth--we would point out the obvious
   fact that no part of the Church can be left behind on earth at the
   Return of Christ into the air, or, otherwise, there would still be a
   hindrance to the consummating of the Mystery of Lawlessness. [11]
   Christ declared that His disciples were "the salt of the earth." They
   are God's preservative. They are His instrument for preventing
   everything on earth going to utter decay and rottenness. But in the
   Tribulation period everything on earth will have gone to utter
   corruption as is clear from the words of our Lord--"For wheresoever the
   carcass is, there will be eagles be gathered together" (Matt. 24:28)--a
   prophetic utterance which will receive its fulfillment at the very
   season of which we are now treating. We are told that in the days which
   immediately preceded the Flood "All flesh had corrupted his way upon
   the earth" (Gen. 6:12) and our Lord declared, "But as the days of Noah
   were, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be" (Matt. 24:37)
   i.e.--His coming back to the earth: the conditions which He will find
   prevailing here at that time.

   We repeat, at the Rapture and during the Tribulation period everything
   on earth will be morally and spiritually rotten. Even God's judgments
   at that time will have no other effect than to cause earth's-dwellers
   to "blaspheme God" (Rev. 16:11 etc.). Hence, is it not evident that the
   whole of the salt(except that which has "lost its savor," i.e., formal
   professors) must have first been removed: that the church and the Holy
   Spirit which now make impossible this total corruption must first be
   "taken out of the way"!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [11] It is true that during the Tribulation period there will be a
   godly "Jewish remnant" upon earth, but they will not hinder the final
   development of "the mystery of lawlessness" and the appearing of the
   Man of Sin and that for two reasons. First, this "remnant" will not
   come to the fore with their testimony until some time after the "Son of
   Perdition" is revealed (quite a number of Scriptures would have to be
   quoted to prove our assertion, but note the exact point at which the
   "two witnesses" of Rev. 11 are manifested), and second, the Jewish
   "remnant" will not be indwelt or empowered by the Holy Spirit for He
   will have been previously "taken out of the way."
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. Because for the believer there is "no judgment" and all upon earth during
  the Tribulation period are unquestionably the subjects of God's judgments.

   One of the most blessed, most remarkable and most far reaching
   utterances which fell from our Lord's lips while He tabernacled among
   men is that recorded in John 5:24 "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
   that heareth My word, and believeth Him that sent Me, hath eternal
   life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into
   life." Nothing could be simpler than this. The one who has received
   Christ as his or her Saviour is for ever beyond the reach of Divine
   "judgment." We quote this verse from the Gospels because the same
   assurance is given to us in the Church Epistles. There, also, we read,
   "There is therefore now no judgment to them which are in Christ Jesus"
   (Rom. 8:1).

   In the above verses an unequivocal assertion is made which requires no
   great learning to understand. Every believer has been justified by God
   Himself, justified eternally, justified "from all things" (Acts 13:39).
   The result of this decision in the High Court of Heaven for those who
   have been pronounced righteous is that there is for them "no judgment."
   Hence it ought to be clear that no believing sinner who has been
   "accepted in the Beloved" can possibly be left on earth during the
   Great Tribulation, for at that time God's sore "judgments will be on
   the earth. That then will be the time when God's Judgments are let
   loose needs no arguing--the last book in the Bible makes that
   abundantly clear. The "seven golden vials" in which are stored up the
   concentrated and long suppressed "wrath of God" (Rev. 15) will then be
   poured forth upon the world which crucified the Lord of Glory. To teach
   then, that any of the members of Christ's Body will be left behind on
   earth to suffer these judgments is to repudiate the express testimony
   of our Lord to the contrary, is to undetermine the glorious doctrine of
   Justification, and is to make God's children the subjects of His
   "wrath" instead of the objects of His love and grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. Because nothing can separate believers from the Love of Christ.

   To those that believe perhaps the most precious and amazing truth in
   all God's Word is Christ's Love for His own. Unlike human love, His
   love knows no change. Unlike human love, nothing can separate us from
   His love--"Who (or "what") shall separate us from the love of Christ?
   Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
   nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For Thy sake we are
   killed all the day long: we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that
   loved us" (Rom. 8:35-37).

   The time when our Lord's Love will be fully exhibited and publicly
   displayed (before all Heaven's inhabitants) is that time when He shall
   rise up from the Father's Throne where He is now seated. Then it will
   be that he shall descend from heaven with a "shout." What will occasion
   this "shout"? What is it that He is descending for? Is it that He may
   return to the earth and take its government upon His shoulder? Is it
   that He may be coronated the King of kings? Is it that He may vanquish
   His blatant enemies? Is it that He may bind that old Serpent the Devil?
   No; important as these may be, there is something else which must take
   the precedence; there is something else which lies much nearer to His
   blessed heart. He descend to receive to Himself His blood-bought
   people. Why? Because He loves them. He comes for that Church which He
   loved and for which He gave Himself in order "that He might present it
   (not a part of it) to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy and without
   blemish" (Eph. 5:27). Ah! this will be the time when "He shall see of
   the travail of His soul and be satisfied," and think you He would be
   "satisfied" by seeing an incomplete Church? To teach then that a part
   of the Church will be left behind when our Lord comes back again to
   receive His people unto Himself is to declare that something
   (unfaithfulness or unworthiness) will separate some of the saints from
   their Redeemer's Love and thus Rom. 8:35 is repudiated. Moreover, it is
   to deny the comforting declaration of John 13:1--"Having loved His own
   which were in the world, He loved them to the end." Therefore, we say,
   Because nothing shall or can separate any believer from the Love of
   Christ, not one shall be left behind when He returns to take unto
   Himself His blood-washed people. As it was declared of Israel of old in
   connection with their leaving Egypt (type of the world)--"There shall
   not a hoof be left behind"(Ex. 10:26).
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. Because the inevitable tendency of the partial-rapture theory is to get
  believers occupied with themselves instead of with Christ.

   We shall not now attempt to argue at length what is a matter of common
   observation. One of the favorite devices of the Enemy is to get the
   believer occupied with something other than Christ who is "Our Hope."
   And, let us say it with emphasis, Satan cares not what that "something"
   may be, providing it shuts out our blessed Lord. This is his favorite
   device for the sinner. While ever the sinner is taken up with his own
   works of righteousness, the Finished Work of Christ is excluded from
   his vision. So it is with the believer. We are bidden to "Seek those
   things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God"
   (Col. 3:1). But to hinder him from doing this Satan is ever seeking to
   get the believer concerned with something else. With some it is "the
   mammon of unrighteousness;" with others it is "the care of this world."
   With some it is politics and civic affairs; with others it is
   Temperance reform work and Social-uplift activities. With some it is an
   intellectual study of doctrine or prophecy divorced from
   heart-occupatin with Christ; with others it is their own experiences
   and attainments.

   The life-task of the believer--blessed privilege--was defined by the
   Lord Himself in that word to Martha, "But one thing is needful" (Luke
   10:42)--i.e., to sit at His feet and find our delight in Him. O that we
   might come to the place where we can say actually and experimentally,
   "Thou O Christ art all I want, more than all in Thee I find." But, as
   we have said, this is exactly what Satan seeks to prevent, and one of
   his "wiles' for preventing it (so it appears to the writer) is the
   partial-rapture theory which today is unsettling so many of the Lord's
   dear people. Teach that participation in the Rapture is a reward for
   faithfulness, and at once, the eyes are turned from Christ to self.
   Necessarily so; for immediately, I shall be occupied with my
   faithfulness, my obedience, my diligence, my service, the effect of
   which will be the drawing of invidious distinctions and the cultivating
   of an I-am-holier-than-thou spirit. But teach that the Rapture is "a
   good hope through grace" and I shall be occupied with my returning
   Lord. The Holy Spirit is here to glorify Christ and not to magnify
   personal attainments, and whether or not a line or system of teaching
   proceeds from Him may be judged by its logical and actual tendency to
   glorify Christ by getting His people occupied with their Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  8. Because the partial-rapture theory introduces a situation that is full of
  Confusion.

   The leading advocates of the partial-rapture theory teach that all
   believers who fail to come to the standard necessary for participation
   in the Rapture will not only be left behind on earth to suffer the
   judgments of the Great Tribulation but that such will have no part or
   place in the Millennial kingdom, and therefore that they will not be
   raised from the dead until after the thousand years. [12] Now apart
   from the fact that there is no Scripture which teaches a resurrection
   of saints at the close of the Millennium, we affirm that such a theory
   as the above involves confusion of the worst kind. We are told that
   certain saints (many of them) because of their unfaithfulness or
   failure to "look" for their returning Saviour will not be raptured at
   the time our Lord descends to the air, in fact will not be "glorified"
   until the close of the thousand years. Unquestionably there have been
   many saints all through this Dispensation who failed to measure up to
   the standard fixed by partial-rapturists and yet, dying hundreds of
   years ago, they have during all the intervening centuries been "present
   with the Lord" (2 Cor. 5:8). What absuridy is it then which teaches
   that these saints who have been with the Lord all these centuries, will
   nevertheless, be separated from Him during the Millennium!

   Again. During the Tribulation period there will be on earth a Jewish
   remnant who will cry unto God in the language of the Imprecatory
   Psalms. These Jews, harassed by the Anti-christ and persecuted by his
   followers, will cry--"Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they
   may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of
   the earth" (Ps. 59:13). They will exclaim:--"Keep not Thou silence, O
   God: hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God. For, lo, Thine
   enemies make a tumult: and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.
   They have taken crafty counsel against Thy people, and consulted
   against Thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off
   from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in
   remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they
   are confederate against Thee. ** Let them be confounded and troubled
   forever; yea let them be put to shame and perish" (Ps. 83:1-5, 13-15,
   17). Now could such prayers as these ascend from the lips of the
   members of the body of Christ who have been saved by grace! The above
   are inspired prayers which the Jews will appropriate to themselves in
   the time of "Jacob's Trouble," but who can imagine Christians praying
   such prayers? We have been instructed to be "king one to another,
   forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you"
   (Eph. 4:32). The saints of this Dispensation are told "Bless them which
   persecute you: bless, and curse not" (Rom. 12:14). The requirement of
   the Church Epistles is, "See that none render evil for evil unto any
   man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to
   all men" (1 Thess. 5:15). If then a part of the Church were on earth
   during the Tribulation period we should have the following strange
   anomaly--The Jews praying to God to take vengeance upon their enemies
   and Christians praying to God to "forgive" these same foes! Surely a
   theory which involves such confusion as this cannot be according to the
   Scriptures.

   The truth is that partial-rapturist's confound entrance into the
   Kingdom with position of honor in it. All believers who belong to this
   Dispensation will partake of the blessedness of the Millennial era and
   will reign with Christ throughout it, but all will not be on the same
   level. Special positions of honor will be allotted to those who have
   qualified themselves for such (Luke 19:17, etc.). Special "prizes"
   await those who shall win these marks of distinction. But this is quite
   another thing from entrance into the Millennial Kingdom itself.
   Entrance into that Kingdom is solely a matter of Divine grace, but an
   "abundant entrance" into it is conditional upon our present fidelity to
   the Lord. New birth admits us into the Kingdom of God (John 3:5), but
   diligent service, faithfulness unto death, and loving the appearing of
   Christ are the several conditions for the "crowns."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] The present argument will not apply against those who hold to a
   modified view, of a resurrection of the left-behind believers at the
   close of the Tribulation period.
     __________________________________________________________________

  9. Because the Church Epistles plainly teach that ALL believers will be
  raptured at the time of our Lord's Return.

   In Rom. 8:30 we read, "Whom He justified, them He also glorified."
   Glorification is co-extensive with justification. This is admitted by
   all: the point at issue is- Will all be glorified at the same time? We
   answer, as surely they will. Do we not read "We shall all be changed in
   a moment, in the twinkling of an eye" (1 Cor. 15:51, 52)? "We shall all
   be changed" at the same moment, for the passage continues "At the last
   trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
   incorruptible, and we (all living believers) shall be changed."

   In 1 Cor. 15:22, 23 we read, "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
   shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the
   firstfruits: afterward they that are Christ's at His coming." Note
   particularly the words, "They that are Christ's at His coming." How
   simple! how all-inclusive! how blessed! It is not "They that are
   faithful or worthy." It is not "they that have attained some high
   standard of moral excellence." It is not "they that have been unusually
   diligent and successful in service." But "They that are Christ's." That
   is all. It is simply a question of belonging to Christ, being one of
   His people.

   In 2 Cor. 5:10 we are told "For we must all appear before the
   judgment-seat of Christ; they every one may receive the things done in
   his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."
   That un-faithful believers are not excluded from this appearing before
   the Bema of Christ is clear from 1 Cor. 3--"Every man's work shall be
   made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be
   revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's word of what sort
   it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
   receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer
   loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire" (1 Cor.
   3:13-15). There will be some in that day who will "suffer loss,"
   nevertheless, they will be present at the Bema with their
   fellow-believers and furthermore, they will be "saved." How remarkable
   it is that these comprehensive assurances are found in the Corinthian
   Epistles--addressed to a church whose moral condition was the worst of
   all the churches addressed by the apostle Paul, as if to anticipate
   this modern heresy of limiting the Rapture to spiritual believers!

   In 1 Thess. 4:16 we read, "And to you who are troubled rest with us,
   when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty
   angels ** when He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be
   admired in all them that believe." Observe once more the universality
   of such a promise, and note, too, its simplicity and how it turns back
   to first principles. Our Lord is to be admired in all them that
   believe. All is traced back to simple faith. It is not at all a
   question of worthiness or attainments. The same simple heart trust in
   Christ which delivered us from the wrath to come, shall most certainly
   secure for every saint a participation in the Rapture and a place in
   the Millennial Kingdom, for this last quoted passage carries us forward
   to the Millennium itself.

  10. Because there is not a single Scripture in the Church Epistles which,
  rightly interpreted, teaches a partial rapture.

   How could there be? Scripture cannot contradict itself. If the Pauline
   Epistles explicitly teach and expressly affirm that "all shall be
   changed in a moment," that "they that are Christ's at His coming shall
   be raised from the dead, that "we must all appear before the
   judgment-seat of Christ" and that when our lord returns to the earth to
   be glorified in His saints He shall be "admired in all them that
   believe" then these same Church Epistles cannot teach that a part of
   the Church only shall be taken to be with the Lord, that merely a
   favored selection from among His people shall be conducted by Him to
   the Father's House, and that the remainder shall be left behind on the
   earth to suffer the judgments of the Great Tribulation or be left in
   their graves until the close of the Millennium. Even though there
   should be certain passages which seem to teach or imply a partial
   rapture we know that it cannot be so, and that is is we who fail to
   expound these passages in harmony with those which positively teach a
   total rapture of the Church.

   It is a fundamental principle of Scriptural interpretation that
   whenever God's Word speaks plainly and emphatically on any subject that
   obscure passages which treat of the same theme must be explained in
   accord with those passages about which there is no dubiety. For
   example, when we hear our Lord saying "My sheep shall never perish"
   etc. then we know that in such passages as those of Hebrews 6 and 10,
   which treat of the irrecoverable doom of apostates, the apostle must
   have had before him professors and not persons who had been born again.
   In like manner when we find a passage which appears to bear upon the
   Rapture and which is in anywise ambiguous then we must not make it
   teach that which would conflict with other passages which deal with the
   Blessed Hope and which are plain and positive.

   "That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the
   fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable unto His death; If
   by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead" (Phil.
   3:10, 11). These words, "If by any means I might attain unto the
   out-resurrection from among the dead" (Greek) are understood by
   partial-rapturists to refer to a select resurrection from among the
   dead at the time of our Lord's Return, and hence, they conclude that as
   the resurrection here referred to is spoken of as a matter of
   attainment, then, only a select company of believers will participate
   therein. But let us ask the question, Does the apostle here refer to a
   physical resurrection? In the New Testament the terms "death" and
   "resurrection" have a fourfold scope, viz:--physical death and
   resurrection, spiritual death and resurrection, judicial death and
   resurrection, and experimental death and resurrection. We need not
   submit proof texts for the first, but we will do so with reference to
   the last three.

   In John 5:24-26 we read, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, He that
   heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting
   life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death
   unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now
   is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that
   hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He
   given to the Son to have life in Himself." Now the words "death" and
   "life" in this passage can only refer to spiritual death, spiritual
   life, and spiritual resurrection--"passed from death unto life." By
   nature we are spiritually dead--"dead in trespasses and sins" (Eph.
   2:1), but by the new birth we pass from death unto life. Regeneration
   is therefore a spiritual resurrection.

   Further. In Rom. 6:2 we read, "How shall we that died to sin (Greek),
   live any longer therein? and in Col. 3:1--"If then ye be risen with
   Christ seek those things which are above." These two verses refer to
   the believer's judicial death and resurrection. This side of the truth
   is little known or understood, but we cannot now dwell upon it at any
   length. One word sums it all up--identification. On the Cross there was
   a double identification--all believers understand the first side of it,
   but few are clear upon the second. In the reckoning of God and in the
   eye of the Law Christ was identified with us as lost sinners. He took
   our place and bore our sins. He endured the full penalty of the broken
   law in our stead. But further, (and it is deeply important that we
   should apprehend this) in the reckoning of God and in the eye of the
   Law all believers were identified with Christ. Hence, every believer
   can say "I was crucified (Greek) with Christ" (Gal. 2:20). In the sight
   of God I died on the Cross because Christ hung there as my substitute
   and what a substitute does or suffers is imputed to the account of the
   one on whose behalf he is acting. Hence, we repeat, in God's sight,
   when Christ died I died, "died to sin," died to the law, died to the
   world, died to everything that had to do with my old standing in Adam.

   But further still. Death did not retain Christ. He rose again, and in
   the reckoning of God I rose too, for all believers were identified
   (reckoned one with) with Christ in His resurrection, so that it is
   written, "But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith
   He loved us, even when we were dead in sins (spiritually, and
   therefore, judicially), hath quickened (made alive) us together with
   Christ" (Eph. 2:4, 9). It is not our individual spiritual quickening
   (the new birth) that is here in view, but our judicial identification
   with Christ--"together with Christ." The next verse goes farther still
   and informs us that, in the reckoning of God, all believers were
   identified with Christ in His ascension--"And hath raised us up
   together (Christ and His people), and made us sit together in the
   Heavenlies (Greek) in Christ Jesus." Observe that this is "in Christ
   Jesus" which refers to our position before God (compare "in Christ
   Jesus" Rom. 8:1) and is not at all a question of experience or
   attainment. We are now prepared to consider the fourth aspect of
   "death" and "resurrection."

   Every believer in Christ has "died to sin," died judicially not
   experimentally, died in the sight of God because he was "crucified with
   Christ." Here then is where faith comes in. God says I am"dead to sin"
   (Rom. 6:2), but "I don't feed dead to sin: my experience shows me
   otherwise" says one. Beloved, it is not a question of "feelings" or
   "experience" but of believing the testimony of God. Hear Him: "Reckon
   ye also yourselves to have died indeed unto sin (Greek) and to be alive
   unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. 6:11). Here then is the
   experimental death and resurrection. By faith I am to translate into my
   practical life what is true of me judicially. Believing God's Word
   which tells me I have died unto sin and that I am alive unto God
   through (or rather "IN") Jesus Christ our Lord, I am now to live in the
   realization and power of that truth. This is what the apostle had
   reference to when he said, "Mortify(put to death) therefore your
   members which are upon the earth" (Col. 3:5): the "therefore" looking
   back to the previous verses where he had been discussing the believer's
   judicial death and resurrection. It was as though he said, See to it
   that your practical state corresponds with the standing which you have
   before God "in Christ."

   Returning now to Philippians 3. Here Paul is speaking of "resurrection"
   but, as we have seen, the New Testament treats of four different orders
   of resurrection, to which of them then is the apostle here referring?
   Is he here speaking of physical resurrection, spiritual resurrection,
   judicial resurrection, or experimental resurrection? The context must
   decide. A close reading of the entire passage will make it evident that
   it is experimental resurrection which the apostle had before him. The
   whole passage refers to his practical experience and is a biographical
   amplification of Romans 6:11. Beginning at the seventh verse he
   says--"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
   Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things (how evident it is that
   the apostle is here recounting a practical experience!), and do count
   them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in Him, not having
   mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through
   the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: That I
   may know Him (the Greek word here is "ginosko" and means know
   intimately), and the power of His resurrection" (verses 3 to 10). The
   apostle yearned to live as one who had been raised from the dead. He
   longed to walk in "newness of life." He desired that he should no
   longer "serve sin." And the fellowship of His sufferings, being made
   conformable unto His death." The apostle longed to tread the same path
   his Lord had trod, to be baptized with the baptism He had been baptized
   with, and to drink of the cup which He drank (Mark. 10:38, 39).

   "If by any means I might attain unto the out-resurrection from among
   the dead" (Phil. 3:11), that is, if, by any means I might experience
   the full and blessed effects of complying completely with the terms of
   Rom. 6:11--reckon myself indeed to have died unto sin and be alive unto
   God. The apostle longed to apprehend or lay hold of that for which he
   had been apprehended, namely, to be "conformed to the image of God's
   Son." What he desired above every thing else for himself, was that he
   might realize practically in his daily life, that which was true of him
   judicially in regard to his standing before God. But had the apostle
   fully achieved his ambition? Had he arrived at the place where he was
   now beyond the reach of the lusts of the "old man"? Did he never yield
   to temptation? Was he delivered from the very presence of sin? Nay,
   verily. The language of the next verse is very emphatic--"Not as though
   I had already attained, either were already perfect" (vs. 12). Here is
   proof positive that in the previous verse the apostle was not writing
   about a future resurrection of the body, for if participation in the
   first resurrection (or of an eclectic resurrection at the return of
   Christ) is the reward for a life of exceptional spirituality, the
   apostle here acknowledges that he himself did not measure up to the
   required standard--and if he did not, who has? No, this passage proves
   too much for the partial-rapturist, for in making the resurrection of
   believers a matter of spiritual attainment he excludes the Apostle Paul
   himself! It should be evident that the apostle is here referring to an
   experimental resurrection, something which had to do with his practical
   everyday life. Someone once said to an Irish brother, "Pat, you are
   dead to sin: Your old man was crucified with Christ." "Yes," was the
   reply "but, I'm frequently troubled with my ghost." Says the apostle,
   "I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do,
   forgetting those things which are behind (his successes and his
   failures; his attainments and his sins), and reaching forth unto those
   things which are before, I press toward the mark (goal) for the prize
   of the high calling (or "vocation") of God in Christ" (vss. 13, 14). A
   further word on this last verse.

   Note the apostle speaks of "the prize of the high calling" which is
   quite distinct from the "high-calling" itself. The "high-calling of God
   in Christ Jesus" is the judicial position which is occupied by every
   believer. It is to this the apostle referred when he said, "I
   therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of
   the vocation(the "high-calling") wherewith ye are called"(Eph. 4:1),
   and for those who do "walk worthy" there is a "prize." Did the apostle
   succeed in winning it? We certainly believe so. 2 Tim. 4 is the SEQUEL
   toPhil. 3! Listen to the beloved apostle as he has arrived at the close
   of his earthly pilgrimage--"I am now ready to be offered, and the time
   of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished
   my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a
   crown of righteousness (the "prize" he so earnestly coveted), which the
   Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me
   only, but unto all them also that love His appearing" (2 Tim 4:6-8).
   May grace be given both reader and writer to fight the good fight of
   faith, to finish our course with joy, and to contend earnestly for the
   faith once for all delivered unto the saints.

                                 Chapter Eight

                The Churchward Results of the Redeemer's Return

   What will take place when our Lord comes back again to receive His
   blood-bought people unto Himself? What will be His portion and what
   will be their portion in that happy day? What will be the results of
   Christ's second advent insofar as they affect the Church? We say "the
   Church," though it would be more accurate to speak of the saints, for
   Old Testament believers equally with the New Testament believers, will
   share in the wondrous blessings and glories of that glad occasion. How
   then will the Redeemer's return affect the redeemed? We leave for
   consideration in our next chapter the question of the worldward results
   of Christ's second advent. For the present, we confine ourselves to the
   results, Chruchward, of the Saviour's appearing. What will these be?
   What will be the order of events? Surely these questions are of
   entrancing interest and profound importance. And blessed be God, they
   are not left unanswered. It is true that the Holy Scriptures were not
   written to gratify an idle curiosity, and that many questions which
   engage our minds are passed over in silence; nevertheless, upon
   everything that concerns our vital interests sufficient has been
   revealed to satisfy every trusting heart.

   Were we to attempt an exhaustive reply to the questions asked above, we
   should be carried far beyond the limits of a comparatively brief
   chapter. All we shall now essay will be to present to our readers an
   outline which sets forth the most prominent features of this phase of
   our subject as they are unfolded in the Word of God. Seven items will
   engage our attention, namely:--The descent from Heaven of the Lord
   Himself, The Resurrection of the sleeping saints, the Translation of
   living believers, the Transformation of every saint into the image of
   our glorified Saviour, the Examination and Rewarding of our works, the
   Presentation of the Church by Christ unto Himself, and the
   Manifestation of the Church with Christ in glory. May the One who has
   been given to take of the things of Christ and shew them unto us,
   illumine our understandings and draw out our hearts in adoring worship.

   The one Scripture which sets forth more fully than any other the order
   of events which shall occur at the Redeemer's return for His saints, is
   found in 1 Thess. 4. In the course of these pages we have had occasion
   to refer to this passage a number of times in various connections, but
   we would ask our readers to bear with us while we quote it once more.
   "For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
   voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
   Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be
   caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
   air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:16, 17). In
   this passage three things claim special notice: first, the descent of
   the Lord Himself; second, the resurrection of the sleeping saints;
   third, the translation to heaven of those believers which shall be
   alive on the earth at that time. Before we enlarge upon these, we would
   first call attention to the close relation the above passage bears to
   our Lord's words as recorded in the opening verses of John 14--"Let not
   your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My
   Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told
   you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place
   for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that were I
   am, there ye may be also" (John 14:1-3). There is a fourfold
   correspondence between these two passages: the Saviour said, "I will
   come again;" the apostle wrote, "The Lord Himself shall descend from
   heaven." The Saviour avowed, "I will receive you unto Myself;" the
   apostle declared that the saints shall be "caught up together to meet
   the Lord in the air." The Saviour promised, "Where I am, there ye may
   be also;" the apostle assures us, "So shall we ever be with the Lord."
   The Saviour prefaced His gracious promises by saying, "Let not your
   heart be troubled;" the apostle concludes by saying "Wherefore comfort
   one another with these words." To borrow the language of T.B.Baines,
   "There can surely be no question that these passages, running so
   closely parallel, relate to the same event." How wonderful is the
   verbal agreement of Holy Writ! How the comparison of one passage with
   another, brings out the unmistakable unity of the Scriptures! And how
   this demonstrates for fact that behind all the human amanuenses there
   was One superintending and controlling Mind! Verily our faith rests
   upon an impregnable rock! But to return to 1 Thess. 4. Let us view
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. The Lord's descent from Heaven.

   "The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout." The Lord
   Himself--who had compassion on the multitude, shed tears at the
   graveside of Lazarus, and wept over Jerusalem; who healed the sick,
   cleansed the leper, and restored the dead to life; who stilled the
   angry waves, cast out demons, and emancipated the captives of Satan;
   who was despised and rejected of men, condemned to a malefactor's
   death, and was crucified on the accursed tree; who rose again on the
   third day, ascended to heaven, and took His place at the right hand of
   the Majesty on high; who has been given the Name which is above every
   name, at which Name every knee shall yet bow, "of things in heaven, and
   things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue
   should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
   Father." Yes "this same Jesus" shall descend from heaven with a shout.

   Forty days after our Crucified Saviour had risen from the tomb, He
   ascended into Heaven "far above all principality, and power, and might,
   and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
   also in that which is to come," and took His seat upon the Father's
   Throne. There He has remained throughout this dispensation waiting,
   patiently waiting for the promised harvest. As He declared, "Except a
   corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it
   die, it bringeth forth much fruit" (John 12:24). The Lord Jesus was the
   "Corn of Wheat" that died, and the Church which is His body is the
   "much fruit" that will be the immediate issue out of that death; we say
   the "immediate issue," for in the Millennium many others shall then
   also enter into the salvation which was purchased upon the cross.

   For nineteen long centuries has the Christ of God waited for the fruit
   of His travail. As the apostle James says, "Behold, the husbandman
   waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for
   it" (Jas. 5:7). Long indeed has the Lord of the harvest waited. Thus,
   too, we read of "The kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ" (Rev. 1:9).
   Slowly but surely has the Church which is His body been growing,
   growing "till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
   the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph. 4:13). And now the time of
   waiting is over. The last member has been added to the Body; the last
   living stone has been fitted into that Temple which the Holy Spirit is
   now building (Eph. 2:21); the last moments of the dispensation of grace
   have run out. Now has come that hour for which the Redeemer has waited
   so long. Now has come the time for the Head to be united to the Body.
   Now it is that the Saviour is to see of the travail of His soul and be
   satisfied.

   "The Lord Himself shall descend." Unspeakably precious is this word to
   the hearts of His own. Christ is coming in person to effect the object
   which He has in view. The joy of welcoming His blood-bought people must
   be exclusively His own. Angels cannot be commissioned to perform it, as
   will be the case when He gathers His scattered people Israel (see Matt.
   24:31). Gabriel was granted the honorus privilege of announcing to Mary
   the first advent of Christ, yet not even to him will be entrusted this
   work. Christ Himself shall give the gathering shout. The Lord Himself
   shall descent. "I will come again" was His promise. The same blessed
   Lord Jesus who loved His own unto death, and who has gone to prepare a
   place for them, is the very One who has pledged His word to return for
   them. He will not send the arch-angel to conduct us to the Father's
   House. No; the Lord Himself is the One who shall descend from Heaven
   with a shout"--with a "shout" of triumph, with a "shout" of joy, with a
   "shout" of welcome. That Voice which summoned Lazarus from the tomb,
   shall again be heard calling the sleeping saints forth from their
   graves. That Voice of the Shepherd who addresseth His own sheep by
   name, shall then be heard calling His "little flock" from the valley of
   the shadow of death unto pastures ever green. That Voice which is "as
   the sound of many waters" (Rev. 1:15) shall then be heard summoning His
   people Home. "The Voice of my Beloved; behold, He cometh leaping upon
   the mountains skipping upon the hills" (Song of Solomon 2:8). And what
   is it that the Voice of the Beloved shall say? "My Beloved spake, and
   said unto me, Rise up, My love, My fair one, and come away. For, lo,
   the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on
   the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of
   the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her green
   figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, My
   love, My fair one, and come away" (vss. 10-13). We turn now to
   consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The Resurrection of the sleeping saints.

   "And the dead in Christ shall rise first." This is the second blessed
   event which shall occur at the Redeemer's return--the sleeping saints
   will be awakened and raised. This brings us to a branch of our subject
   upon which there is much ignorance and confusion in Christendom
   generally. The idea which popularly obtains is that of a general
   resurrection at the end of time. So deeply rooted is this belief and so
   widely is it held that to declare there will be two resurrections--one
   of saints and another of sinners, the two being separated by a thousand
   years--is to be regarded as a setter forth of strange ideas and
   extravagant fancies. Nevertheless, the teaching of Scripture upon this
   point is exceedingly plain and explicit. Probably many of those who
   will read these pages are already clear upon this distinction, but the
   sake of those who are not we must briefly outline the teaching of God's
   Word upon this subject, first quoting, however, from one whose writings
   have been justly esteemed by Christians of every shade of thought.

   John Bunyan who was certainly a close student of the Divine Oracles
   wrote, "Now when the saints that sleep shall be raised thus
   incorruptible, powerful, glorious and spiritual; and also those that
   then shall be found alive, made like them; then forthwith, before the
   unjust are raised, the saints shall appear before the judgment-seat of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, there to give an account to their Lord the Judge
   of all things they have done; and to receive a reward for their good
   according to their labor. They shall rise, I say, before the wicked,
   they being themselves the proper "children of the resurrection," that
   is, those that must have all the glory of it, both as to preeminency,
   and sweetness; and, therefore, they are said, when they rise, to rise
   from the dead; that is, in their rising, they leave the reprobate world
   behind them. And it must be so, because also the saints will have done
   their account, and be set upon the throne with Christ as kings and
   priests with Him to judge the world, when the wicked world are raised."

   But without citing human testimony any further, let us turn to the
   teaching of Christ and the inspired writings of His apostles. On one
   occasion the Lord said, "But when thou makest a feast, call the poor,
   the maimed, the lame, the blind; And thou shalt be blessed; for they
   cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed if there is to be
   but one resurrection--a general resurrection of all the dead--then why
   did our Lord make the above distinction and qualification of "the
   resurrection of the just"? Again, in Luke 20:34, 35 we read, "The
   children of this world marry, and are given in marriage. But they which
   shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection
   from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage." What can be
   the meaning of such words as "they which shall be accounted worthy to
   obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead" if All the dead
   alike are sure of participating in an indiscriminate resurrection.
   Worthiness to obtain the resurrection from the dead certainly implies
   there will be some who are not esteemed worthy, and hence will not be
   partakers of the resurrection here mentioned; therefore, the conclusion
   is irresistible that there must be two distinct resurrections. That
   there will be is further seen from the language of John 5:28,
   29--"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which, all that
   are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that
   have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
   evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." Here the two resurrections
   are sharply distinguished both as to name and participants, and as we
   shall see, there is to be a long interval of time between them.

   The testimony of the apostolic Epistles is in strict harmony with the
   teaching of our Lord recorded in the four Gospels. In 1 Cor. 15:21-23
   we read, "For since by man came death, by man came also the
   resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
   shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the
   firstfruits: afterward they that are Christ's at His coming." It is
   important to notice that the resurrection of the wicked is not
   contemplated in this chapter at all, but is strictly limited to the
   resurrection of Christ and His saints. The words "all be made alive"
   are qualified by the clause which immediately precedes them. It has
   reference solely to those who are "in Christ." Christ Himself is the
   "firstfruits" (the reference is to the type of Lev. 23:10) and the
   harvest that is garnered at His return are "they that are Christ's."
   Again, we are told that the people of God in Old Testament times who
   refused to accept deliverance from death at the hands of their
   persecutors, did so "that they might obtain a better resurrection"
   (Heb. 11:35) which expression is quite meaningless if there is but one
   general resurrection in which saints and sinners shall alike
   participate.

   One other Scripture yet remains to be considered, namely Rev. 20:4-6
   "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto
   them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of
   Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast,
   neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads,
   or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
   years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
   years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy
   is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second
   death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ,
   and shall reign with Him a thousand years." Here we learn not only that
   the resurrection of the saints is quite distinct from that of the
   wicked, but we are also expressly told that an interval of a thousand
   years lies between the two. It were meaningless to speak of the
   resurrection of the "blessed and holy" as the first resurrection" if
   there is no second resurrection of the wicked to follow. The righteous
   shall all be raised before the Millennium begins, but the lost shall
   not be raised until its close. Thus we see that the uniform teaching of
   the New Testament respecting the resurrection of sleeping believers is
   in perfect accord with our Thessalonian Scripture--"The dead in Christ
   shall rise first." None but the "dead in Christ" will come forth from
   their graves in response to the assembling shout of our descending Lord
   at the time of His second advent. But now consider,

  3. The Translation of living believers.

   "Then we which are alive and remain (on the earth) shall be caught up
   together with them (the resurrected ones) in the clouds, to meet the
   Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord." In connection
   with this statement we would call attention to another Scripture which
   at first sight appears to have no bearing upon it at all. We refer to
   the words of our Lord recorded in John 12:32--"And I, if I be lifted up
   from the earth, will draw all men unto Me." We hesitate to set forth
   our own understanding of this passage because it differs widely from
   the generally received interpretation of it. It is from no desire to
   pander to the modern and miserable craving for novel expositions of
   Scripture that we advance our own view, but simply because necessity is
   laid upon us. "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto
   Me" _the word "men" inserted in italics has no equivalent in the
   original, and hence we must understand the "all" to refer to all
   believers. The question we would now raise is, What does the "drawing
   unto Christ" here have reference to? Personally, we do not think it has
   any reference to salvation, for where coming to Christ for salvation is
   in view it is the "Father" who is said to do the "drawing." This may be
   verified by a reference to John 6:44, where we read, "No man can come
   to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw him." Therefore we
   submit that our Lord's words here point to the catching up of the
   saints at the time of His return, that it is then He will "draw" them
   all "unto Himself." The words "I ** will draw all unto Me" correspond
   very closely with that other word of His which has reference to this
   same event--"I ** will receive you unto Myself" (John 14:3). We would
   further suggest that the reason why this "drawing" of all believers
   unto Himself at the time of His return is linked with His "lifting up"
   is to show us that this consummating blessing, like every other we
   enjoy, is based upon His cross-work for us. Finally; it is highly
   significant, and seems to corroborate our interpretation, that in the
   verse immediately preceding the one now under consideration, our Lord
   said, "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
   world be cast out." It was then--"now"--at the Cross, that the Divine
   sentence was passed but it will not be until the Rapture that it will
   receive its execution. It is immediately following the "catching up" of
   the saints, their "drawing" to Christ, that God's "judgment" will fall
   upon "this world," as it is then also that its "prince"--"Satan"--will
   be "cast out" of his present domains (see Rev. 12:7-9). Who are the
   ones that shall be "drawn" unto Christ at that day? The answer is found
   in our Thessalonian Scripture--"Then we which are alive and remain
   shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
   of the air." We have already contemplated the resurrection of the
   sleeping saints, let us now say a few words concerning those believers
   who shall be alive on earth at that time.

   It is often said, "There are many things in this life which are
   uncertain, but one thing is sure: we must all die; we must all pay
   nature's debt." Nothing is more common than to hear such affirmations
   as these which set death before the believer as his inevitable
   prospect. Such assertions are regarded as axiomatic. Frequently they
   are repeated from the pulpit. But not so do the Scriptures teach. The
   Word of God distinctly declares, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall
   all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye" (1 Cor. 15:51,
   52). So that instead of it being certain that all will die, it is
   absolutely certain that all believers will not die. A whole generation
   of Christians, namely, those that are alive upon the earth when our
   Lord descends from Heaven will be "changed in a moment," and without
   passing through death at all, shall be caught up together with the
   resurrected saints to meet the Lord in the air.

   The prospect which God's Word sets before every believer is the
   imminent return of Christ. Not a dread anticipation of death, but
   "looking for the Saviour" is to be our daily occupation. Translation to
   Heaven and not the grave is our goal. That is why it is termed "that
   blessed hope," and that is why we are said to be "begotten again unto a
   living hope"--a living hope in a dying scene. This hope was active in
   the hearts of the first-century saints. The Thessalonians had "turned
   to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His
   Son from heaven." They were waiting for Christ not death. Observe that
   in our text the apostle includes himself among the number of those who
   might be alive on the earth at the time of Christ's second
   advent--"Then we (not "ye") which are alive and remain shall be caught
   up;" and again, "We shall not all sleep." The beloved apostle was not
   looking the "the king of terrors" but for "the King of Glory."


   Lord, tis for Thee Thy coming we wait;

   The sky not the grave is our goal:

   The rapture, not death, we gladly await,

   Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, O my soul.

   A striking illustration and type of the removal to heaven of those
   believers which shall be on the earth at the time of our Lord's return
   is found in the rapture of Enoch, "By faith Enoch was translated that
   he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated
   him" (Heb. 11:5). Here was a man of like passions with us, who was
   raptured to Heaven without seeing death. Such is the blessed prospect
   which Scripture sets before the Christian as his present hope. We
   repeat, that all believers on earth at the time of our Lord's descent
   into the air, shall altogether escape the gloomy portals of the tomb
   and be translated to Heaven to meet the Lord and be for ever with Him.
   This will be the fulfillment of our Lord's promise "I will come again
   and receive you unto Myself." Observe that our Lord does not say, "I
   will come again and take you unto Myself," but "I will come again and
   receive you unto Myself." The thought suggested by this distinction is
   exceedingly precious. "Taking" is an action confined to myself. I may
   enter an empty room and take a book from the table. But receiving is an
   action that brings in another. If I "receive" a book the necessary
   inference is that someone handed it to me. Exactly so will it be at the
   Rapture. The saints of God are not left alone in this cold
   wilderness-world. The "other Comforter, even the Spirit of truth" has
   come to take up His abode in the church, and it is from Him that the
   Lord Jesus will "receive" it. * And observe further that our Lord did
   not say "to Heaven," or "to the Father's House," but "unto Myself." The
   person of Christ is to be the Object before the eye and heart. Thus it
   was the martyr Stephen--"Lord Jesus receive my spirit." Thus it was
   with the apostle Paul--"To depart and be with Christ which is far
   better;" and again, "absent from the body, present with the Lord." The
   heart occupied with Him.

   "To meet the Lord in the air. Why should the Church meet the Lord in
   "the air," rather than on the earth? We would suggest a twofold reason.
   First, Because the Church is heavenly not earthly. It is heavenly in
   its origin (1 Cor. 15:48). It is heavenly in its calling (Heb. 3:1). It
   is heavenly in its citizenship (Phil. 3:20). It is heavenly in its
   blessings (Eph. 1:3). It is heavenly in its destiny (1 Pet. 1:4).
   Therefore will the Church meet its Head in the "air"--the atmospheric
   heavens. But second; I believe this joyous meeting between the Lord and
   His blood-bought people is to be in the air, rather than in the Heaven
   of heavens, for the purpose of privacy. The eyes of the world shall not
   gaze upon that holy scene, nor will even the angels (so far as
   Scripture indicates) witness that first moment when the Redeemer shall
   meet the redeemed.

   "And so shall we ever be with the Lord," which, as we have seen
   corresponds with His own blessed promise, "That where I am there ye may
   be also." Wondrous privilege! Marvelous prospect! Truly, such love
   "passeth knowledge." The place which is due to the Son is the same
   place which shall be accorded the sons. We are made "joint heirs with
   Christ." His inheritance and blessedness shall be shared with His
   redeemed. He shall come Himself to conduct us to His place! But are we,
   shall we be, fit, to dwell in such a realm? The answer to this question
   leads us to consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. The Transformation of each believer into the Image of our glorified
  Saviour.

   In the beginning, man was made in the image and likeness of God, but
   sin came in and as the consequence that image has been defaced and that
   likeness marred. Has then the purpose of Jehovah been thwarted? Not so:
   "The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever" (Ps. 33:11). Therefore it
   is written, "For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of His Son" (Rom. 8:29). The time when this
   purpose and promise of God will be realized is at the Return of His
   Son. It is then that God's elect will be completely "conformed to the
   image of His Son." It is then that they shall "be changed, in a moment,
   in the twinkling of an eye." It is then that "this corruptible shall
   put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality." But to
   particularize.

   In Rom. 7:24 the question is asked, "O wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Part of the answer to
   this interrogation is recorded in Rom. 8:11--"But if the Spirit of Him
   that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up
   Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His
   Spirit that dwelleth in you." This Scripture has been the occasion of
   considerable controversy of late and some wild fancies have been
   indulged concerning it, yet is its meaning quite simple. The
   "quickening of our mortal bodies" does not refer to resurrection, nor
   to "healing," but to that "change" which shall take place in the
   physical beings of those believers on earth at the Redeemer's return.
   Here, as everywhere, the apostle has the "blessed hope" before his
   heart and he would interpose nothing between (not even death and
   resurrection) the present moment and the realization of that hope. The
   "quickening of our mortal bodies," the "changing" of them in a moment,
   is described in Phil. 3:20, 21 _"For our citizenship is in heaven; from
   whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; Who shall
   change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious
   body, according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all
   things unto Himself." These present corruptible bodies of ours shall be
   transformed into bodies like unto that glorious body now worn by our
   Lord. That is, like His body as it appeared on the mount of
   transfiguration--dazzling in its splendor; like unto His body as it
   appeared unto Saul as he journeyed to Damascus--scintillating with a
   brilliancy which surpassed the shining of the midday sun. What a
   glorious transformation that will be! Each saint will be given a body
   of glory fitted to and for the scene to which he shall go, as his
   present body is fitted to this earth. Scientists tell us that the
   little sparkling diamond which we admire so much, was once a piece of
   carbon, a fragment of charcoal which has undergone a marvelous
   transformation, converting the little piece of black charcoal into the
   resplendent jewel. This, perhaps, is Nature's type of the glorious
   transformation that awaits us, when the Saviour shall take our present
   mortal body and fashion it like unto His glorious body.

   Physical transformation is not all that awaits the believer. At our
   Lord's return there will be a mental, moral and spiritual
   transformation too. In 1 John 3:2 we are told, "Beloved, now are we the
   sons of God, and it doth not yet appear, we shall be like Him; for we
   shall see Him as He is." The emphasis here is often thrown upon the
   wrong words. Some read this verse as though it had reference to present
   ignorance of our future condition, the clause "it doth not yet appear
   what we shall be," being understood to signify "We don't really know
   now what we shall yet be." But this is a mistake, for we do "know" as
   this very verse informs us--"we know that, when He shall appear, we
   shall be like Him. The emphatic words are "It doth not yet appear what
   we shall be." What we are really going to be like awaits its
   manifestation till our Lord's appearing. Let us illustrate. I hold in
   my hand a small seed: it is unlovely in appearance and gives no promise
   at all of what it will ultimately become. It doth not yet appear what
   it shall be. But I plant that seed in the ground, and a few weeks later
   it has become a strong plant, and one morning I wake and find it
   covered with the most beautiful flowers. Now the potentialities of that
   little seed are fully manifested. So it is with the believer. He looks
   at his own heart and wonders if after all he is a child of God. His
   body is just the same as the bodies of unbelievers, and viewed by the
   eye of sense he seems to be no different from them in anywise. No;
   because his real "life is hid with Christ in God" (Col. 3:30--it doth
   not yet appear what he shall be, nevertheless he knows (by faith) that
   when Christ shall appear, he shall be like Him, for he shall see Him as
   He is.

   "We shall be like Him." Who dare limit this exceeding great and
   precious promise? "Like Him" physically, for our vile body shall then
   be "fashioned like unto His glorious body." "Like Him" mentally! Today
   we are very unlike Him mentally: our minds now are often harassed with
   evil thoughts, they are clouded and darkened by the effects of the
   Fall, and are subject to many limitations; but when Christ appears that
   which is "perfect" shall come and then, no longer shall we see through
   a glass darkly and know in part, but we shall know as we are known. We
   shall be "like Him" morally and spiritually. Sin will be erased from
   our beings; every trace and effect of the Fall shall be eradicated from
   our persons. Then will God's predestinating purpose be fully realized.
   Then shall we be completely "conformed to the image of His Son."
   Blessed transformation! Glorious prospect! We shall be like Him.


   "High in the Father's house above

   My mansion is prepared,

   There is the home, the rest I love,

   And there my bright reward.

   With Him I love, in spotless white,

   In glory I shall shine;

   His blissful presence my delight,

   His love and glory mine.

   All taint of sin shall be removed,

   All evil done away;

   And I shall dwell with God's Beloved

   Through God's eternal day."
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. The Examination and Rewarding of the believer's works.

   "Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give every man
   according as his work shall be" (Rev. 22:12). If it is true that the
   general teaching of Christendom upon the subject of the Resurrection is
   unscriptural, the popular conception of future judgment is still more
   erroneous. It is generally believed that at the end of time saints and
   sinners shall all stand before the judgment-bar of God; that they will
   be divided into two great classes--"the sheep and the goats;" that
   those whose names are found written in the book of life will pass into
   Heaven, and that the wicked will be consigned to the Lake of Fire. For
   this conception (excepting the last clause) there is not a single verse
   of Scripture when rightly interpreted. So far as believers are
   concerned the Sin question has been closed forever, for their sins were
   all judged at the Cross where their Substitute died the Just for the
   unjust. Consequently, all who have believed in the Lord Jesus are
   forever beyond the Curse of the Law. This is clear from our Lord's own
   words--"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and
   believeth on Him sent Me, hath everlasting life and shall not come into
   condemnation," or as the Revised Version more correctly renders it,
   "shall not come into judgment" (John 5:24). How erroneous then the
   prevailing conception; and how absurd! Shall the apostle Paul, who has
   already been in Heaven for more than eighteen hundred years, yet have
   to appear before the judgment-bar of God, in order to ascertain whether
   he shall spend eternity in Heaven or in the Lake of Fire? How could
   this be, when we are distinctly told "There is therefore now no
   condemnation (judgment) to them which are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1).
   Furthermore, observe that it is said of the sleeping saints they are
   raised in glory" (1 Cor. 15:43). How then could a glorified saint be
   consigned to the Lake of Fire? And if there is no possibility of him
   going there, then what need is there for any Assize to decide his
   eternal destiny? No; the judgment of the Great White Throne concerns
   the wicked only.

   But are we not told in 2 Cor. 5:10 "We must all appear before the
   judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in
   his body; according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad"?
   Yes, we are. Let us then examine this Scripture. First, it is to be
   remarked that the Greek word which is here translated "judgment-seat"
   is "Bema." At the time the New Testament was written the Bema was not a
   judicial bench upon which a judge sat, passing sentence upon criminals
   (an entirely different word was used for it), but was the throne from
   which the judge distributed prizes to the victors in the games. Such
   will be the Bema of Christ.

   In the second place, the purpose of the appearing of believers "before
   the Bema of Christ" is not to test their title and fitness for Heaven,
   but in order that their works may be examined and their service
   rewarded. A Scripture which throws much light upon this is to be found
   in 1 Cor. 3:11-15, "For other foundation can no man lay than that is
   laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation
   gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work
   shall be made manifest: for the day will declare it: because it shall
   be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what
   sort it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereon, he
   shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall
   suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire." Here we
   learn that the foundation of the believer's salvation is Jesus Christ
   Himself and that his subsequent works and service are likened to a
   building which he erects upon this foundation. The different kinds of
   works and service are likened to a building which he erects upon this
   foundation. The different kinds of works which the believer
   performs--good and bad--are regarded as two classes of materials which
   he employs in the building he is erecting. In the day of Christ's
   appearing his building is to be tested by fire, which means that his
   works will be examined and the motives which produced them carefully
   scrutinized. Those works which will endure the searching process will
   be rewarded, those which are worthless will perish, and in the latter
   instance, the individual, though saved, will "suffer loss."

   When the Lord returns, every servant will be called upon to give an
   account of his stewardship. Notice will be taken of how our talents
   were employed and how our time was redeemed. The whole life of the
   believer will be examined in detail in the light of the Throne and his
   deeds measured by the Divine standard. Words spoken now and actions
   performed in this world, will then be weighed in the Balances of the
   Sanctuary. Things will then be seen in their true colors and labeled at
   their real worth by the impartial hand of the Omniscient Christ.

   The difference between the two classes of materials mentioned in the
   above Scripture points to a most solemn truth. "Gold, silver, precious
   stones are of intrinsic value, whereas "wood, hay, stubble" are a
   natural growth. In Scripture "gold" symbolizes the Divine nature,
   "silver" Divine redemption, and "precious stones" the Divine glory.
   Those works of the believer which have issued from the Divine nature
   within us, are based upon Christ's redemption, and have been performed
   for God's glory, will receive reward; but those which were wrought by
   those who felt they must do something, those performed in the energy of
   the flesh, those done merely for self-aggrandisement will all be burned
   up. What a conflagration there will be in that day! What surprises
   there will be at the Bema of Christ! An hundred-dollar subscription,
   given to get a name, will be ashes in that day; while a dime given to
   help the poor for the Lord's sake will receive an imperishable reward.


   "Deeds of merit as we thought them

   He will show us were but sin:

   Little acts we had forgotten

   He will tell us were for Him."

   No work done out of love for Christ will lose its reward. "For God is
   not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have
   shewed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the saints" (Heb.
   6:10). All that endures the test of that day will be publicly,
   abundantly and eternally rewarded. There, before His Father and in the
   presence of the holy angels, our gracious Redeemer will delight to say
   to the rewarded one, "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast
   been faithful over a few things, I will made thee ruler over many
   things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" (Matt. 25:23).

   The subject of rewards is a wide one and we can only deal briefly with
   it here. Four crowns are mentioned in the New Testament: the
   Incorruptible crown (1 Cor. 9:25), which is the reward for faithful
   service; the crown of Righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8), which is given to
   those who love Christ's appearing; the crown of Glory (1 Pet. 5:4),
   which is reserved for faithful pastors who have tended the flock; and
   the crown of Life (Rev. 2:10), which is a special reward reserved for
   martyrs. Each crown is conditional, conditional upon faithfulness to an
   absent Christ. But to return now to 2 Cor. 5:10.

   The prospect of our manifestation before the Bema of Christ is both
   joyous and solemn. It is "joyous" because it is then that everything
   will come out into the light and all misunderstandings will be cleared
   up; because everything which will not endure the Divine test will be
   "burned up;" and because every work which was done with an eye single
   to God's glory will receive commendation from our blessed Lord Himself.
   It is "solemn" because then it will be seen how much of our work was
   nothing but "wood, hay, and stubble;" because we shall then discover
   how sadly we had failed to "redeem the time;" and because we shall
   "suffer loss." Ah! my brethren it behooves us to live in the light of
   that day now so near at hand. Let our chief ambition be that all we say
   and do shall meet with the approval of our Lord at the Bema. Yes, the
   contemplation of the Bema is solemn and searching. He who has lived in
   selfish ease and carnal gratification will be the loser throughout all
   eternity. But he who has "denied himself" out of love for and gratitude
   to the Saviour, shall yet hear His "Well done" and enter into His joy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. The presentation of the Church by Christ to Himself.

   When every saint of God shall have been made like Christ, made "like
   Him" physically, mentally, morally and spiritually, and after each
   individual's life and works have been examined before the Bema, then is
   the Church publicly presented and Eph. 5:25-27 is fulfilled--"Christ
   also love the Church, and gave Himself for it; That He might sanctify
   and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word, That He might
   present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle,
   or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish." The
   word "present" here means "to set alongside of." Christ is yet going to
   set the Church alongside of Himself. The Church will share His glory
   and reign with Him throughout the Millennium. As saith the
   Scriptures--"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My
   throne" (Rev. 3:21). The Church will then have been fitted for this
   exalted position, for observe that Christ presents the Church to
   Himself "a glorious Church." In that day none of the defiling "spots"
   of sin shall be found in the Church, and not a "wrinkle"--the mark of
   age and corruption--shall mar its beauty, but with youth eternally
   renewed the Church shall then perfectly reflect the glory of Christ.
   Then shall He be able to say, "Thou art all fair, My love; there is no
   spot in thee" (Song of Solomon 4:7).

   Another Scripture which tells of the presentation of the Church is to
   be found in Jude 24--"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from
   falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory
   with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and
   majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen." We believe the
   reference here to the "exceeding joy" is that of Christ Himself. This
   was "the joy" that was set before Him when He endured the Cross and
   despised the shame (Heb. 12:2).

   Closely connected with the public Presentation of the Church is,

  7. The Manifestation of the Church with Christ.

   The last time the world saw the Lord Jesus He was alone--all alone in
   death. But when He returns to this earth He will not be alone. His
   saints will accompany Him. He is the "Firstborn among many brethren"
   (Rom. 8:29), and when He appears again they will be with Him. "He that
   goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come
   again, bringing His sheaves with Him" (Ps. 126:6). Yes, that blessed
   One who humbled Himself to become the Sower shall return with "His
   sheaves"--"Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints"
   (Jude 1:14).

   "The Spirit Himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
   children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
   joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may
   also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this
   present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall
   be revealed in us" (Rom. 8:16-18). Observe that "the glory" here
   mentioned is to be revealed, and revealed in us; and further, that it
   is a glory which we shall share with Christ glorified together." When
   will this glory be "revealed in us" together with Christ? The answer is
   at the time of His return to this earth, for "When Christ, who is our
   life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory" (Col.
   3:4)--"in glory" for before this, our present bodies will have been
   "fashioned like unto His glorious body." It is in connection with this
   appearing of Christ with His saints in glory that we read, "For the
   earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the manifestation of
   the sons of God" (Rom. 8:10). In that day the sons of God--whose life
   is now "hid with Christ in God"--will be manifested manifested with
   Christ in glory. Then will our Lord's prayer be fully
   answered--"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which
   shall believe on Me through their word; That they all may be one; as
   Thou, Father, are in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in
   Us: that the world may believe that Thou has sent me. And the glory
   which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as
   we are one" (John 17:20-22).


   "Soon shall come that glorious day

   When, seated on Thy throne,

   Thou shalt to wondering world's display

   That Thou with us art One."

   These are the Results of the Redeemer's Return as they affect the
   Church--results in part for the half hath not been told. The Lord
   Himself descends from Heaven with a shout, awakening the sleeping
   saints and translating them together with living believers, to meet Him
   in the air. Then, all are conformed to the image of God's Son and made
   "like Him." Next, the saints appear before the Bema that their works
   may be examined and their service rewarded. Finally, as Christ prepares
   to return to the earth, He sets the Church, now glorious within and
   without, alongside of Himself, and as He appears before the eyes of the
   world the Church appears with Him, to be the object of never-ending
   wonderment and admiration as it is seen what great things the Lord hath
   wrought for those who were by nature children of wrath and deserving of
   nought but eternal condemnation. In view of such a prospect must we not
   long for God to hasten the glad day of our Lord's return, and are we
   not compelled to cry "Even so, Come, Lord Jesus"!

                                  Chapter Nine

                 The Worldward Results of the Redeemer's Return

   In the last chapter we considered seven of the Churchward Results of
   the Redeemer's Return. We saw that the One who left His disciples
   almost nineteen centuries ago, is coming back again, that the Lord
   Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout; that this Shout will be
   heard by all the saints whether alive on the earth or asleep in their
   graves, and that at the time He gives this Shout our Lord will exert a
   miraculous "drawing" power which shall "catch up" His people unto
   Himself so that they meet Him in the air, after which they come before
   the Bema in order that their works may be examined and their service
   rewarded; subsequently, after an interval of seven years or more, the
   Lord returns to the earth accompanied by His people in glory. It is
   concerning the Interval which follows the Rapture and some of the
   things which shall occur during this period of time which are now to
   engage our attention. What is to take place on earth after the Church
   has been removed from it? What are the conditions that will obtain in
   this world during the interval which divides the two stages in the
   second advent of Christ? What is the course of events which shall
   culminate in the Return of the Redeemer to the Mount of Olives to usher
   in the long-promised Millennium? The Scriptures which make answer to
   these questions are exceedingly numerous and our chief difficulty is to
   select and classify.

   What will occur on earth after the saints have been removed? In seeking
   to summarize the predictions which bear upon this time, we shall
   confine ourselves again to seven of the most prominent items, namely,
   the Consternation of the world at the removal of the Church, the
   Hopeless condition of those left behind, God's dealings with the earth
   in judgment, the character and career of the Antichrist, the situation
   of the Jews during this period, the Battle of Armageddon, and the
   Return of Christ to the earth itself. Before we study these seriatim, a
   further word or two is necessary to prepare the reader for what
   follows.

   The length of time which separates between the secret coming of Christ
   to the air for the purpose of catching up His people and His subsequent
   and public return to the earth itself is not clearly defined in
   Scripture. It is certain, however, that this interval will last at
   least seven years and if, as the writer believes and an increasing
   number of prophetic students conclude, a goodly proportion of the Jews
   are to return to Palestine, if their Temple in Jerusalem is to be
   re-built, if Babylon is to be restored until it becomes again the
   metropolis of the world, then it will last much longer, possibly
   seventy years in all. For the sake of convenience we shall refer to
   this interval as the Tribulation period, though to be strictly accurate
   the "great Tribulation" is but three and a half years in length, the
   final three and a half years before the Lord Jesus returns to the
   earth.

   Anyone who has given himself at all seriously to the study of Prophecy
   will immediately recognize the difficulty of seeking to arrange in
   chronological order the things which are shortly coming to pass.
   Concerning the exact sequence of details we cannot be absolutely
   dogmatic, but so far as the general outline is in question that is
   plain. With these explanatory remarks let us now turn directly to the
   subject before us. And,
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. The World's Consternation at the sudden and secret Removal of the Church.

   One can better imagine than describe the awe-inspiring effect upon the
   world which will be occasioned by the secret removal of the Church. We
   say "secret removal" for we know of nothing in Scripture which
   intimates that our Lord's Shout shall be heard by any save His own
   people, and judging from the analogies furnished by the cases of the
   translation of Enoch and Elijah nothing will be known of the Church's
   rapture until after it has occurred. That the world will not witness
   the catching up of believers to meet their Saviour in the air seems to
   be further borne out by the fact that their translation and
   transformation will be so swiftly accomplished that it is all said to
   occur "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye." We take it then that
   the removal of the Church will be both sudden and secret.

   Some day in the near future, how near none can say, but probably in the
   lifetime of the present generation, the world will awaken to find that
   a most startling phenomenon has occurred. A large number of their
   fellow-men and women will have mysteriously disappeared, leaving no
   traces behind them! In many a home there will be more than one vacant
   chair. In many an office and store there will be vacant stools. From
   every walk of life there will be taken those who "Chose rather to
   suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures
   of sin for a season: esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches
   than the treasures of the world: for they had respect unto the
   recompense of the reward" (Heb. 11:25, 26). Possibly some seats in the
   Senate and some thrones will be vacant, for God's children are
   "scattered abroad" (John 11:52) in many spheres and callings. The
   phenomenon of the missing ones will be no local one, but earthwide in
   its range. It is highly probable that from every village, town, and
   city, in this land, there shall be taken those who are caught up to met
   the Lord in the air. Imagine then the amazement, the consternation, the
   commiseration of those that are left behind! Imagine the panic which
   shall seize their hearts. If they search, their search will be in vain.
   No trace of the missing ones will be forth-coming. Imagine again the
   dismay and the awe, as the news is received from other lands that his
   same mysterious phenomenon has occurred there too! Will it take the
   left-behind ones very long to find a solution to the mystery? Will it
   be very difficult for them to find an explanation which will account
   for the disappearance of God's people from the earth? We believe not.
   The imminent coming of Christ has been so widely proclaimed both by
   voice and pen that there are now comparatively few people who are in
   complete ignorance upon this subject. Today the wise of this world may
   sneer and scoff at the truth that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh,
   but then, when it is too late to profit from the witness that is now
   being borne, it shall be seen that those who were looking for that
   blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour
   Jesus Christ were no mere visionaries and fanatics, but sober men and
   women whose faith was founded upon the unerring Word of God. O what
   anguish will fill those who gave no heed to the faithful warning of
   their godly friends! And here we would pause a moment and ask, Reader,
   How is it with you? Suppose that Christ should come today--and He may-
   in which class would you be found? Would you be among the "wise"
   virgins who are ready for the Bridegroom's appearing, or would you be
   numbered among the "foolish" virgins who had made no adequate
   preparation for this great event? Pass not this question lightly by. It
   is now the most momentous question which can possibly engage your
   attention. You say, you hope you would be among those that are ready.
   But you cannot afford to be uncertain upon this matter, the issues are
   far too serious and solemn. Stop right here we beseech you and honestly
   examine yourself and see whether you be in the faith. Do you know
   within your heart that you are un-prepared, that all your efforts have
   been directed toward the securing for yourself a comfortable position
   in this world? Then, let us ask, "What shall it profit a man, if he
   shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" Do you say, I have
   already faced that question and I know now how to make the necessary
   preparation. Are you constrained to ask, "What must I do to be saved?"
   Then the answer, God's own answer, is ready at hand--"Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." Appropriate the provision
   which Divine grace has made for lost sinners. Flee to Christ while
   there is yet time. Turn away from self with all its resolutions and
   failures, its doings and its sins and cast yourself on the Lord Jesus.
   Heed that pressing word, "Behold, now is the accepted time; behold now
   is the day of salvation." Boast not thyself of tomorrow, for thou
   knowest not what a day may bring forth. Tomorrow may be too late.
   Before tomorrow the Lord may have come, and then the door of mercy will
   be closed against you. And this leads us to consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The Hopeless condition of the left-behind ones.

   What will happen when Christendom awakens to the solemn fact that the
   real Church, the Church of God, has been removed from this earth and
   taken to be with the Lord? Again we say, it is not difficult for our
   imagination to supply the answer. But we are not left to the exercise
   of our imagination; the Holy Scriptures contain a plain and full reply
   to our inquiry. The Word of God intimates that following the Rapture of
   the saints many of the left-behind ones will earnestly seek the
   salvation of their souls. Multitudes of men and women will, for the
   first time in their lives, all upon the name of the Lord and cry unto
   Him for mercy. But their cry will not be heard. Their seeking will be
   in vain, because they have delayed the all-important matter of their
   salvation until it is too late. The door of mercy will then be closed,
   for the Day of Salvation will have ended. Often had these left-behind
   ones been warned, but in vain. Servants of God had faithfully set
   before them their imperative need of fleeing from the wrath to come;
   knowing the terror of the Lord, they had sought to persuade their
   unsaved hearers to be reconciled to God, only to be laughed at for
   their pains. And now the tables will be turned. God will laugh at them,
   laugh at their calamity and mock at their fear. Listen to the solemn
   declaration of Holy Writ--"Because I have called, and ye refused; I
   have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at
   nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof; I also will laugh
   at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear
   cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when
   distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then they shall call upon Me, but
   I will not answer; they shall seek Me early, but they shall not find
   Me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the
   Lord: They would none of My counsel: they despised all My reproof.
   Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled
   with their own devices." (Prov. 1:24-31). Unspeakably solemn words are
   these--words which ought to be thundered forth from every pulpit in the
   land. Many the time had these same people heard the Gospel preached,
   but they had deliberately hardened their hearts. Many the time had they
   been urged to "Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him
   while He is near" (Is. 55:6), but they despised the invitations of
   Divine grace. Now they shall reap as they have sown. Hitherto they had
   mocked God; now God shall mock them. Hitherto Go had called to them,
   but they had refused to attend; now shall they call upon God and He
   will decline to answer them.

   Parallel with this solemn declaration is the Old Testament Scriptures
   we find our Lord Himself testified, "Strive to enter in at the strait
   gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be
   able when once the Master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to
   the door, and ye being to stand without, and to knock at the door,
   saying Lord, Lord, open unto us; and He shall answer and say unto you,
   I know ye not whence ye are" (Luke 13:24, 25). These words contain an
   amplification of His utterance concerning the "foolish
   virgins"--"Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
   open to us. But He answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
   not" (Matt. 25:11, 12). Whoever the "great multitude" of Rev. 7 may be,
   it is certain that none in Christendom who have rejected the Gospel
   during the present dispensation will be among that number. 2 Thess.
   2:10-12 is equally explicit. The Anti-christ shall come "with all
   deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they
   received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for
   this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
   believe a lie: that ALL might be damned who believed not the truth, but
   had pleasure in unrighteousness." Let it then be distinctly understood
   that, there will be no "second chance" for present-day Christ rejectors
   left behind on the earth after the removal of the Church, for when the
   Church goes the Holy Spirit, too, is taken away. Knocking and crying
   then will be useless. The door has been closed. The Day of Salvation is
   over. An angry God shall then mock those who have mocked Him. As it was
   with Israel of old, so shall it then be with a God-forsaken
   Christendom--"Therefore will I also deal in fury: Mine eye shall not
   spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in Mine ears with
   a loud voice, yet will I not hear them" (Ezek. 8:18). Unsaved reader,
   consider thy peril. The Lord is at hand, and if you are not among the
   number caught up to meet Him in the air, then your doom will be
   eternally sealed. "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life:
   and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of
   God abideth on him" (John 3:36). But not only shall the left-behind
   ones seek the Lord in vain, but they shall be the objects of His wrath.
   This leads us to consider--
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. God's dealings with the earth during the Tribulation period.

   The interval of time which separates the removal of the Church from the
   earth to the return of Christ to it, is variously designated in the
   Word of God. It is spoken of as "the day of vengeance" (Is. 61:2). It
   is called "the time of Jacob's trouble" (Jer. 30:7). It is the "hour of
   temptation, which shall come upon all the world" (Rev. 3:10). It is
   denominated "the great day of the Lord" (Zeph. 1:14). It is termed "the
   great tribulation" (Matt. 24:21). It is the time of God's "controversy
   with the nations" (Jer. 25:31). In Dan. 12:1 it is described as "a time
   of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that
   same time." Our Lord referred to this same period when He said; "For in
   those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of
   the creation, which God created unto this time, neither shall be. And
   except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be
   saved: but for the elect's sake, whom He hath chosen, He hath shortened
   the days" (Mark 13:19, 20). As one reads these unspeakably solemn
   Scriptures the question naturally occurs to our minds, Why will this
   period be visited with sorer afflictions than any season which has
   preceded it since the commencement of human history? The answer is,
   Because this will be the time when the thrice holy God avenges the
   Death of His blessed Son. God has a "controversy with the nations,"
   observe "the nations" not "nation" for the Gentiles, equally with the
   Jews, shared in the awful crime of the Crucifixion. It is written in
   Rom. 12:19, "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give
   place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,
   saith the Lord." And, as in everything, so here, the Holy One sets us a
   perfect example--"Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He
   suffered, He threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth
   righteously"(1 Pet. 2:23). Yes, He committed Himself unto Him that
   judgeth righteously, and now the time will have come when His cause
   shall be espoused and when the righteous Judge shall exact full
   satisfaction for that awful crime perpetrated nineteen centuries ago.
   On the Cross, the Smitten One cried, "Pour out Thine indignation upon
   them, and let Thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their
   habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents. For they
   persecute Him whom Thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of Thy
   wounded" (Ps. 69:24-26). Then will be the time when God answers that
   prayer.

   Yes, my reader, you are living in a world which is stained with the
   blood of God's own Son, and which in the sight of Heaven now lies
   beneath the guilt of that terrible crime, a crime which each new
   generation since then has perpetuated by "Crucifying to themselves the
   Son of God afresh, and putting Him to an open shame" (Heb. 6:6). Long
   have God's judgments been withheld. Long has His grace been displayed.
   But soon shall this dispensation of grace close, and then shall the
   Lord God make answer to His Son's cry and "pour out His indignation"
   upon the world which murdered the Lord of Glory. This "pouring out of
   God's indignation" is described in numerous passages. We read in Zeph.
   1:14-18, "The great day of the Lord is near, and hasteth greatly, even
   the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there
   bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a
   day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a
   day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm
   against the fenced cities, and against the high towers. And I will
   bring distress upon men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and
   their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.
   Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in
   the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by
   the fire of His jealousy: for He shall make even a speedy riddance of
   all them that dwell in the land." Again we read, "Behold, the whirlwind
   of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall
   fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the
   Lord shall not return, until He have done it, and until He have
   performed the intents of His heart: in the latter days ye shall
   consider it" (Jer. 30:23, 24). And once more we are told, "For, behold,
   the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that
   it shall leave them neither root nor branch" (Mal. 4:1).

   No less than thirteen chapters--6 to 19--in the last book of the Bible
   are devoted to a description of the terrible judgments which God will
   pour upon the earth during the Tribulation period. We cannot now review
   all of these chapters, but will confine ourselves to a brief
   examination of a portion of the sixth. "And there went out another
   horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take
   peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there
   was given unto him a great sword" (Rev. 6:4). The symbolism here is
   easily interpreted. The "red horse" denotes blood-shed and slaughter.
   Peace is taken "from the earth" not merely from one country, or even
   from a whole continent, but from the earth itself. The fulfillment of
   this is yet future. But coming events cast their shadows before them,
   and the length of the shadows which are even now cast across the earth,
   shows how near we have approached to the dread reality itself. Today,
   the saints of God are "the salt of the earth," preserving the human
   race from going to utter corruption, and the Holy Spirit who is now
   here exerts a restraining influence upon the powers of evil. But in the
   day contemplated by Rev. 6 the Holy Spirit will have gone, the Church
   will have been removed, and then will the wildest passions of men be
   let loose and a time of mutual slaughter and universal carnage shall
   ensue.

   "And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair
   of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four
   living creators say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures
   of barley for a penny" (Rev. 6:5, 6). The "black horse" symbolizes
   lamentation and mourning: the "balances" that which will be employed
   for carefully weighing out the cereals: the "penny" is a day's wage
   (see Matt. 20:2). Added to the horrors of universal war, depicted by
   the previous "seal" judgment, there will be an unparalleled scarcity of
   food, and the very necessaries of life will be sold at famine prices.
   For centuries God has blessed the earth with abundant crops, but His
   mercies have been received without thanksgiving. But in that day there
   shall be a general scarcity of food and multitudes will die of
   starvation.

   "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him
   was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given unto them
   over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword; and with hunger,
   and with death, and with the beasts of the earth" (Rev. 6:8). As it was
   in connection with His plagues upon Egypt of old, so during the
   Tribulation period God's judgments will increase in severity. The "pale
   horse" signifies Death, and his rider is thus denominated. Death is
   accompanied by Hades: the former seizing the body, the latter claiming
   the soul. In this one judgment no less than a fourth of earth's
   inhabitants will be slain by God's avenging agents, while those that
   are left will be tormented by the pangs of hunger and terrified by wild
   beasts.

   "And I beheld when he opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great
   earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon
   became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth, even as a
   fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
   wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;
   and every mountain and island were moved out of their places" (Rev.
   6:12-14). In addition to the horrors of war, famine, and wild beasts,
   there will follow the most fearful convulsions of Nature. First, there
   is a "great earthquake," an earthquake unparalleled in the history of
   man, and beside which the destruction of Pompeii and the catastrophe at
   San Francisco will, by comparison, fade away into utter insignificance.
   God Himself terms this a great earthquake--great in its severity and
   great in its reach, for it will shake the entire earth and even the
   mountains and islands of the sea will be moved out of their places.
   Next, we are told that, to add to the sufferings of earth's afflicted
   inhabitants, the "sun" will be darkened, as though it were reluctant to
   shine upon such a scene of judgment and death. Furthermore; the moon
   will be transformed into an object of horror. Long had men despised the
   precious blood which the Lamb of God shed upon the Cross. But now the
   day will have come when God will compel all men to look upon blood. Now
   that it is too late for the blood of Christ to save them, God will mock
   them by turning the moon into blood, so that it shall no longer shed
   its silvery light as hitherto, but will then cast a crimson glow upon
   the scene of God's judgments. As though this were not enough, the
   heavens will exhibit their wrath upon the earth which crucified their
   Creator, and will cast their stars upon it. All nature will be
   convulsed and all the earth will be encompassed by these unparalleled
   plagues.

   A similar picture of the Divine judgments which will be inflicted at
   this time is furnished by the prophet Isaiah, "Behold the day of the
   Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land
   desolate. And He shall utterly destroy the sinners out of it. For the
   stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their
   light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall
   not cause her light to shine. And I will punish the world for their
   evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy
   of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the
   terrible. I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
   than the golden wedge of Ophir. Therefore I will shake the heavens, and
   the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of
   hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger" (Is. 13:9-13). These words
   are to be taken at their face value and understood literally.

   What shall be the effect of all this? Let us return to Revelation 6 and
   read the Holy Spirit's own description of the consternation of mankind
   at this time. "And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the
   rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
   bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the
   rocks of the mountains; And they said to the rocks and the mountains,
   Fall on us, and hide us from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great day
   of His wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?" (Rev. 6:15-17).
   A prayer meeting is convened--one unrivaled for size and earnestness,
   and one to which all classes and conditions of men assemble. Kings and
   rulers will be present. Hitherto they were more often found at
   Race-meetings than Prayer-meetings. all classes of men will be there.
   Many an opportunity for prayer had they missed in the past. Many the
   time they had lain down at night upon a pray-less bed. They had
   regarded prayer as a profitless occupation, as so much time wasted, as
   an exercise fit only for women and children. But now they fall
   prostrate on their faces. When prayer would have availed, they scorned
   it; now that it is useless they go at it with a will. Such is the
   pravity and folly of human nature. But note the object of their
   prayers! They pray not to the living God, but to the inanimate rocks
   and mountains. They cannot pray to the Lord God for they never learned
   how to address Him, and now it will be too late to learn for the Holy
   Spirit, who is the inspirer of all real prayer, has been "taken out of
   the way." They pray not to the Rock, but to the rocks. They had made
   material things their gods, and so to these they now address their
   petitions. Note, too, the burden of their prayers! They ask to be
   hidden from the face of God and from the wrath of the Lamb. When they
   had opportunity, they refused to acknowledge His Love, they slighted
   the overtures of His Mercy, so now they have to endure His wrath. To
   see God's face is the deepest longing of His people: to be "hid from
   His face" will be the one desire of those left behind for judgment.

   Above, we have reviewed only down to the end of the sixth "Seal"
   judgment. There is a seventh which is itself divided into the seven
   "Trumpet" judgments, the seventh of which is again divided, divided
   into the seven "Vial" judgments. Little does the world dream of what is
   coming upon it. The present war with all its horrors gives but a faint
   conception of what will shortly come to pass on this earth. Not only
   will peace be entirely removed from the earth, not only will all Nature
   be convulsed by the outpouring of God's wrath, but the Bottomless Pit
   will be opened and out of it shall issue two hundred millions of
   supernatural locusts, having tails like scorpions and stings in their
   tails, and for five months they will "torment" those who have not been
   destroyed by the previous plagues. The torment inflicted by these
   infernal creatures will be so unendurable, that we are told "And in
   those days shall men seek death." But mark the still more awful
   sequel--"and shall not find it: and shall desire to die, and death
   shall flee from them"(Rev. 9:6). At a later stage, earth's inhabitants
   will be "scorched with great heat" and so terrible will be their
   suffering and so incurable is the wickedness of their hearts as it will
   then be manifested, that we read, "and they gnawed their tongues for
   pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their
   sores, and repented not of their deeds" (Rev. 16:9-11). Such will be a
   part of the "indignation" which God will yet pour out upon this guilty
   world as His response to that cry made by His beloved Son as he hung
   upon the Cross. But we must turn now and consider another prominent
   feature of the Tribulation period, namely,

  4. The revelation and career of the Anti-christ.

   Who is the Anti-christ?

   Varied and wild have been the answers to this question. In
   pre-christian times there were many who regarded Antiochus Epiphanes as
   the one whom Daniel and the other prophets described. At the beginning
   of this dispensation Nero was looked upon as the predicted Man of Sin.
   After the Reformation the Papacy was selected as the fulfiller of the
   prophecies given through the Patmos seer. And in our day there have
   been those who consider the Kaiser to be the Son of Perdition. It
   cannot be denied that each of these infamous characters have manifested
   various characteristics which will yet be fully displayed by the
   Anti-christ, yet, they none of them match complete the delineation of
   the Man of Sin which is given in the prophetic word. There is one
   Scripture which is quite sufficient to prove that none of those
   mentioned above are the Anti-christ, a Scripture, moreover, which makes
   it certain that he has not yet been revealed, and cannot be revealed
   until after the Rapture of the Church. We refer to 2 Thess. 2:7,
   8--"For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is One
   that restraineth now, until He be taken out of the way. And then shall
   be revealed the Lawless One" (R.V.). The One who now "restrains" is the
   Holy Spirit, and the time when He is "taken out of the way" is at the
   removal of the Church which is His "temple." Here then is a conclusive
   argument: the Anti-christ cannot be "revealed" or publicly manifested
   while God the Spirit is on the earth.

   Who is the Anit-christ? Having shown who cannot have been the
   Anti-christ, let us now consider the positive answer to our question.
   In the first place, he will be a man, a real man, just as truly man as
   the Son of God was the Son of Man. The Anti-christ is termed "The Man
   of Sin" (2 Thess. 2:3). In the second place, he will be a Jew, if he
   were not he would be unable to make good his claims to be the real
   Christ; if he were not a Jew he could not deceive the Jews. That he
   will be a Jew, seems clear from Dan. 11:37. In the third place, he will
   be the Super-man, he will be a supernatural character, he will be the
   Son of the Devil. It is clear from Rev. 20:10 that there is an Evil
   Trinity, as there is the Holy Trinity. The Anti-christ will be the
   second person of the Evil Trinity as the Lord Jesus is the Second
   Person of the Holy Trinity. As Jesus Christ was the God-Man, so the
   Anti-christ will be the Devil-Man.

   There are at least three Scriptures which prove the super-human
   character of the Anti-christ. The first is found in Gen. 3:15. In this
   verse there is a double"enmity" spoken of: God says, "I will put enmity
   between thee and the woman," that is, between Satan and Israel, for
   Israel was the woman that bore Christ (see Rev. 12); "And between thy
   seed and her seed." Observe particularly that two"seeds" are here
   spoken of, "thy seed" (the antecedent is plainly the "Serpent") and
   "her seed" the woman's Seed. The woman's "Seed" was Christ, the
   Serpent's "Seed" will be the Anti-christ. The Anti-christ then, will be
   more than a man, he will be the actual and literal Seed of that old
   Serpent the Devil, as Christ was, according to the flesh, the actual
   and literal Seed of the woman. "Thy seed," Satan's seed, refers to a
   specific individual, just as "her Seed" refers to a specific
   Individual.

   The second Scripture which proves that the Anti-christ will be
   super-human, the offspring of Satan, is found in John 8:44--"Ye are of
   your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was
   a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because
   there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his
   own; for he is a liar, and the father of it." In the Greek there is the
   definite article before "lie"--the lie, "The Lie." There is but one
   other passage in the New Testament where "The Lie" is mentioned and
   that is in 2 Thess. 2:11 where again the definite article is found in
   the Greek, and here the reference to the Anti-christ is unmistakable. A
   threefold reason may be suggested as to why the Anti-christ should be
   termed "The Lie." First, because his fraudulent claim to be the real
   Christ will be the greatest falsehood palmed upon humanity. Second,
   because he is the direct antithesis of the real Christ who is "The
   Truth" (John 14:6). Third, because he is the Son of Satan who is the
   arch-Liar. But to return to John 8:44--"When he (the Devil- speaketh
   (concerning) The Lie, he speaketh of his own." His "own" what? His
   "own" Son--the remainder of the verse makes this very plain--"for he
   (the Devil) is a Liar and the father of it" i.e., of "The Lie." The Lie
   then is Satan's "Son"! The third Scripture which proves that the
   Anti-christ will be superhuman is even still plainer. In 2 Thess. 2:3
   he is expressly said to be "The Son of Perdition."

   Who is the Anti-christ? He will be a man, a Jew, a supernatural being,
   the "Seed" of the Serpent, the Son of Perdition. Where is he today? It
   is possible that even now he may be on the earth, though personally we
   hardly think this is likely. But if he is not yet born then the
   unequivocal answer is, He is in the Abyss or Bottomless Pit (Rev.
   11:7). This Scripture contains the first reference to "the Beast" in
   the Revelation. The question naturally arises, How did he get there?
   and when was he sent there? In answering this question we are well
   aware that we shall call down upon us the criticism and censure of
   brethren that we honor and love, yet, notwithstanding, we must again be
   true to our convictions and faithful in presenting what we believe to
   be the teaching of Holy Scripture on this solemn and mysterious
   subject. When was the "Beast" consigned to the Bottomless Pit? We
   answer, when Judas Iscariot died! The Anti-christ will be Judas
   Iscariot re-incarnated. The proof for this startling assertion (we may
   say, a by no means novel one, though our study of this point has been
   conducted independently) will now be humbly submitted to the critical
   attention of our readers.

   Who was Judas Iscariot? He was the one by whom the Lord of Glory was
   betrayed. He was a "man" (Matt. 26:24). But was he more than a man? Let
   Scripture make answer. In John 6:70 we read, "Have not I chosen you
   twelve, and one of you is a Devil?" It is hardly necessary to say that
   in the Greek there are two different words for "Devil" and "demon."
   There are many demons but only one Devil. Further, in no other passage
   is the word "Devil" applied to anyone but to Satan himself. Now here in
   John 6:70 our Lord says of Judas that he is "ho diabolos" not
   "daimonizomai": the definite article is employed--one of you is "the
   Devil." Judas then was the Devil incarnate, just as the Lord Jesus was
   God incarnate. Christ Himself said so, and we dare not doubt His word.
   Again, in John 17:12 He said, "Those that Thou gavest Me I have kept,
   and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition." Here then is the
   answer of Scripture itself. Who was Judas Iscariot? He was the Devil
   incarnate; he was the Son of Perdition.

   Now let us see how Scripture connects the Anti-christ with Judas and
   shows that they are one and the same person. In the first place, as we
   have already pointed out, the first reference to "the Beast" (the
   Anti-christ) in the Revelation is 11:7, where we read of "the beast
   that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit." We asked, How and when did
   he go there? And we answered, at the death of Judas. Have we any
   Scripture which supports this assertion? We believe so. Mark the
   language used in Acts 1:25, "That he may take part of this ministry and
   apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to
   his own place." Of no one else in all the Bible is it said that at
   death he went "to his own place." Put these two Scriptures
   together--Judas went "to his own place," the Beast ascends out of the
   Abyss. Again, in Rev. 17:8 we read, "The Beast that thou sawest was,
   and is not; and shall ascend out of the Bottomless Pit, and go into
   perdition." This verse is generally understood to refer to the revived
   Roman Empire and with this interpretation we are in accord, but we
   believe it is a mistake to limit it to this. In the Apocalypse, the
   Roman Empire and its final and Satanic Emperor are very closely
   connected, so much so, that at times it is difficult to distinguish
   between them. But in Rev. 17 they are distinguishable. In verse 8 we
   are told that the Beast "shall ascend out of the Bottomless Pit," and
   that he shall "go into perdition" In verse 11 we are told, "And the
   Beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven,
   and goeth into perdition." Now nearly all expositors are agreed that
   the Beast of verse 11--"the eighth (head, and form of government of the
   Roman Empire) is the Anti-christ himself; then why not admit the same
   of verse 8? In both, the designation is the same--the Beast; and in
   both, we are told he "goeth into perdition." We take it, then, that
   what is predicated of "the Beast" in 17:8 is true of both the Roman
   Empire and of its last head or Emperor (the Anti-christ)--of the
   former, in the sense that it is infernal in its character. Viewing it
   now as a declaration of the Anti-christ, what does it tell us about
   him? Four things. First, he "was." Second, he "is not." Third, he shall
   "ascend out of the Bottomless Pit." Fourth, he shall "go into
   perdition." The various time marks here concern the Beast in his
   relation to the earth. First, he "was" i.e., on the earth. Second, he
   "is not" i.e. now on the earth (cf. Gen. 5:24, "Enoch was not for God
   took him," i.e. "was not," any longer on the earth). Third, he shall
   "ascend out of the Bottomless Pit" (where he now is) which agrees with
   11:7. Fourth, he shall "go into perdition." We learn then from this
   Scripture that at the time the Apocalypse was written that the Beast
   "was not" then on the earth, but that he had been on it formerly.
   Further, we learn that in John's day the Beast was then in the
   Bottomless Pit but should yet ascend out of it. Here then is further
   evidence that the Anti-christ who is yet to appear has been on earth
   before! If this is not sufficient to prove that the Anti-christ will be
   a reincarnation of Judas our next Scripture ought to decide the matter.
   As we have seen in John 17:12 Christ termed Judas "the Son of
   Perdition" and in 2 Thess. 2:3 we find that the Man of Sin is similarly
   designated--"that Man of Sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition." These
   are the only two places in all the Bible where this name occurs, is it
   not clear then that Judas and the Man of Sin are one and the same
   person? What other conclusion can a simple and unprejudiced reader of
   the Bible come to? [13]

   Who is the Anti-christ? We have dwelt upon his mysterious person, and
   we would now call attention to a number of passages in Scriptures
   (which the reader will do--will to look up and prayerfully study) in
   which he is variously denominated and described. He is the "bloody and
   deceitful man" of Ps. 5:6. He is the "man of the earth" of Ps 10:18. He
   is the "Head over many countries" of Ps. 110:7. He is the "little horn"
   of Dan. 7:20-27. He is the "vile person" of Dan. 11:21. He is the
   "proud man" of Hab. 2:5. He is the rider on the four horses in Rev. 6.
   He is the "fallen star" of Rev. 9:1. He is the "Beast" of Rev. 13:1-8.
   He is the "Lawless One" of 2 Thess. 2:8, 9.

   As can be well imagined the Scriptures draw a sharp contrast between
   Christ and the pseudo Christ. It is remarkable how complete the
   antithesis is. We give a twelve-fold contrast between their various
   designations. The one is called the Christ (Matt. 16:16), the other the
   Anti-christ (1 John 4:3). The one is called "the Man of Sorrows" (Is.
   53:3, the other "the Man of Sin" (2 Thess. 2:3). The one is called "the
   Son of God" (John 1:34), the other "the Son of Perdition" (2 Thess.
   2:3). The numerical value (the gematria) of the name Jesus is 888, the
   number of the Anti-christ's name is 666 (Rev. 13:18). The one is called
   the Seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15), the other the Seed of the Serpent
   (Gen. 3:15). The one is called the Lamb (Is. 53:7). the other "the
   Beast" (Rev. 11:7). Christ is called "the Holy One" (Mark 1:24), the
   Anti-christ is termed "the Wicked One" (2 Thess. 2:8). The one is
   called "the Truth" (John 14:6), the other "the Lie" (John 8:44). The
   one is called "the Prince of Peace" (Is. 9:6), the other "the Profane
   Prince" (Ezek. 21:25). The one is called "the Glorious Branch" (Is.
   4:2), the other "the Abominable Branch" (Is. 14:19). The one is called
   "the Good Shepherd" (John 10:11), the other "the Idol Shepherd" (Zech.
   11:17). The one is called "the Mighty Angel" (Rev. 10:1), the other
   "the Angel of the Bottomless Pit" (Rev. 9:11).

   Not only do the Scriptures point a complete contrast between Christ and
   the Anti-christ in their several names and titles but the same is true
   in regard to their respective characters and careers. Christ came down
   from heaven (John 3:13), but the Anti-christ comes up out of the
   Bottomless Pit (Rev. 11:7). Christ came in Another's name (John 5:43),
   but the Anti-christ will come in his own name (John 5:43). Christ came
   to do the Father's will (John 6:38), but the Anti-christ will do his
   own will (Dan. 11:36). Christ wrought in the power of the Holy Spirit
   (Luke 4:14), but the Anti-christ will be energized by Satan (Rev.
   13:4). Christ submitted Himself to God (John 5:30), but the Anti-christ
   will defy God (2 Thess. 2:4). Christ "humbled" Himself (Phil. 2:8), but
   the Anti-christ will "exalt" himself (Dan. 11:36). Christ honored the
   God of His fathers (Luke 4:16), but the Anti-christ will refuse to do
   so (Dan. 11:37). Christ cleansed the Temple (John 2:14-16), but the
   Anti-christ will defile the temple (Matt. 24:15). Christ ministered to
   the needy (Luke 4:18), but the Anti-christ will refuse to do so (Zech.
   11:16). Christ was rejected of men (Is. 53:3), but the Anti-christ will
   be accepted by all the world (Rev. 13:4). Christ "leadeth" His flock
   (John 10:3), but the Anti-christ will "leave" his flock (Zech. 11:17).
   Christ was slain for the people (John 11:51), but the Anti-christ will
   slay the people (Dan. 11:44). Christ glorified God (John 17:4), but the
   Anti-christ will blaspheme God (Rev. 13:6). Christ was received up into
   Heaven (Luke 24:51), but the Anti-christ goes down into Hell (Rev.
   19:20).

   The remarkable career of the Anti-christ is sketched in a number of
   different Scriptures, some of which we shall now briefly consider. In
   Daniel 7 the prophet is given a vision of the four great
   world-empires--Babylonish, Medo-Persian, Grecian and Roman--which are
   symbolized by as many "beasts." The fourth beast is described in verse
   7--"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
   dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
   teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces (referring to the conquests
   under the Caesars), and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it
   was diverse from all the beasts that were before it (entirely different
   in its form of government); and it had ten horns." In verse 24 these
   "ten horns" are said to be "ten kings that shall arise" which
   corresponds with Rev. 17:12 where the Roman Empire revived and in its
   final form is again in view. In Dan. 7:8 we read, "I considered the
   horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn,
   before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the
   roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and
   a mouth speaking great things." The "little horn," which occupies a
   prominent place in this chapter, symbolizes the Anti-christ who will be
   the Head of the revived Roman Empire. The part that he will play is
   described in verses 20 to 26 in this same chapter. "And of the ten
   horns that were in his head (i.e., of the beast which represents the
   Roman Empire), and of the other (the Anti-christ) which came up, and
   before whom three fell (three of the kings); even of that horn that had
   eyes (symbol of intelligence), and a mouth that spake very great
   things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. I beheld, and the
   same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until
   the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the
   Most high; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom
   (which looks forward to the Millennium). Thus he said, The fourth beast
   shall be the fourth kingdom on earth (i.e., the fourth universal
   kingdom after the Times of the Gentiles had begun), which shall be
   diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall
   tread it down, and break it in pieces. And the ten horns are ten kings
   that shall arise (in the Tribulation period): and another shall rise
   after them: and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue
   three kings. And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and
   shall wear out the Saints of the Most High, and think to change times
   and laws: and they (the "times and laws") shall be given into his hand
   until a time (a year) and times (two years) and the dividing of time
   (half a year--three and a half years in all). But the judgment shall
   sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy
   it unto the end." Here we are told, first, that the Anti-christ will
   "have a mouth speaking very great things: which we know from 2 Thess. 2
   refers to his audacious claim to be God Himself. Second, that he will
   "make war with the saints." These "saints" are the godly Jewish remnant
   which will refuse to render him homage and in consequence will be slain
   (cf. Rev. 20:4). Third, he will "speak great words against the Most
   High" which clearly identifies him with the Man of Sin. Fourth, he will
   "think (purpose) to change times and laws," the reference being to the
   religious feasts and festivals of Israel which the Anti-christ will
   abolish, for everything which bears testimony to God he will seek to
   destroy. Fifth, his "dominion" shall be taken away from him, for at the
   close of the Tribulation period he will be cast into the Lake of Fire
   (Rev. 19:20).

   In Daniel 8 the "little horn" is mentioned again. Many regard this
   "little horn" as symbolizing a different personage from the one brought
   before us in the previous chapter, and this, because here he is said to
   arise out of the third kingdom (Greece), whereas in chapter 7 he is
   seen coming up out of the fourth (the Roman Empire). But this we regard
   as a mistake. To us, this method of interpretation appears very much
   like the reasoning of the Jews who of old denied that their Messiah
   could come out of Nazareth because it was written that He should be
   born in Bethlehem. Or, to make these two "little horns" separate
   characters seems to us like the device of the ancient Rabbis who taught
   there would be two Messiahs, the one suffering Messiah and the other a
   triumphant Messiah. No; rather do we regard each of the "little horns"
   as representing the same person, but viewing him in different
   connections and relationships. That each of the "little horns" do point
   to the Anti-christ seems clear from a comparison of what is predicted
   of them with what is said of the Anti-christ in other places.

   To quote now from Daniel 8: "And out of one of them came forth a little
   horn which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the
   east, and toward the pleasant land (Palestine). And it waxed great,
   even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of
   the stars to the ground and stamped upon them (probably a symbolical
   reference to his deposing of certain rulers, corresponding with the
   plucking up of the "three kings" in the previous chapter). Yea, he
   magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily
   sacrifice was taken away (which action clearly identifies him with the
   Anti-christ), and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And a host
   was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression,
   and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced and
   prospered" (vss 9-12). Here again the Anti-christ is seen subduing
   governmental powers and enlarging his own kingdom. Here again we see
   him inflated with egotism--"magnifying himself," which is a
   characteristic mark of all the prophecies which describe the
   Anti-christ, a mark by which we are enabled to identify him. And here
   again we see him opposing the Jews, and destroying that which bears
   witness to God--"taking away the daily sacrifice."

   In Dan. 11:36-45 we have another prophetic picture of the character and
   career of the Anti-christ. We do not quote the whole of this passage
   but merely the first two and last verses of it. "And the king shall do
   according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself
   (the last two words showing that he is the same character as symbolized
   by the "little horn"--compare 8:11) above every god, and shall speak
   marvelous things against the God of gods (cf. 7:25). and shall prosper
   till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall
   be done. Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
   of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.
   And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in
   the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none
   shall help him." Here we are told the Anti-christ will be a "king." He
   will be king of the Jews and king over the restored Roman Empire in its
   ten-kingdomed form. He will be a king of kings. His blatant impiety is
   pointed out in the words "he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself
   against every god." The words "Neither shall he regard the God of his
   fathers" call attention to his Jewish nationality. "Nor the Desire of
   women" (cf. Haggai 2:7) is a Hebraism for the Messiah. The birth of the
   Messiah was the great hope of Israel and every Jewish maiden desired
   above everything else to have the honor of being the mother of the
   promised One. The Anti-christ then will deny both the Father and the
   Son (see 1 John 2:22). The closing verse refers to his destruction.

   In 2 Thess. 2 we also read, "Let no man deceive you by any means: for
   that day (the day of Christ--the Millennium) shall not come, except
   there come a falling away first, and that Man of Sin be revealed, the
   Son of Perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
   called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
   Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. ** For the Mystery of
   Iniquity doth already work: only He who now letteth (restraineth) will
   let (restrain), until He (the Holy Spirit) be taken out of the way. And
   then shall that Wicked One be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
   with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of
   His coming (to the earth itself) even him, whose coming is after the
   working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and will
   all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they
   received not the love of the truth, they that they might be saved. And
   for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
   believe the Lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the
   truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness" (vss. 3, 4, 7-12).
   Incredible as it may seem, Satan will be permitted to travesty the
   miracle of Bethlehem. Observe that the incarnation of the Son of God is
   termed "the mystery of godliness" (1 Tim. 3:16) while, above, the
   incarnation of the Son of Perdition is styled "the mystery of
   iniquity." Satan is going to send forth his own son into this world,
   born under supernatural circumstances and combining in his person the
   human and Satanic natures. The daring blasphemy of the coming
   Anti-christ is also mentioned again. He will "sit in the Temple" a
   re-built Temple in Jerusalem "shewing himself that he is God." He will
   assume the place and prerogatives of the true Christ, will in fact
   claim to be Christ Himself. His audacious claim will be supported by
   imposing credentials, for he will work miracles by which he will
   deceive the whole world, Apostate Christendom, previously "spued out"
   by Christ (Rev. 3:16) will be given over by God to believe the Lie,
   that is, they will be completely deceived and will readily accept the
   Anti-christ as the Lord Jesus. But his end is sure. The Lord shall
   "consume him with the spirit of His mouth, and destroy him with the
   brightness of His coming."

   One other Scripture must suffice. In Rev. 13 we read, "And I stood upon
   the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having
   seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his
   heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a
   leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the
   mouth of a lion: and the Dragon (the Devil) gave him (the Anti-christ)
   his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his
   heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and
   all the world wondered after the Beast. And they worshipped the Dragon
   which gave power unto the Beast: and they worshipped the Beast, saying,
   Who is like unto the Beast? who is able to make war with him? And there
   was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and
   power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he
   opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and
   His tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto
   him to make war with the saints and to overcome them: and power was
   given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that
   dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in
   the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"
   (vss. 1-8).

   The last quoted Scripture is a case in point where it is difficult to
   distinguish between the kingdom and its king, the empire and its
   emperor. The "beast" which is here seen rising out of the "sea"
   symbolizes the revival and restoration of the old Roman Empire and
   corresponds with Daniel's fourth beast. In Scripture the "sea" figures
   the restless nations away from God. Revelation 13 contemplates a time
   of political upheaval and social disturbance. Out of revolutionary
   conditions will issue the revived Roman Empire, the last head of which
   will be the Anti-christ. Many students of prophecy regard the head of
   this Empire as another person than the Anti-christ. It is supposed
   there will be two men on earth at this time, the one controlling
   political affairs, the other dominating the religious realm. But we
   fail to see anything in Scripture which justifies this distinction. On
   the contrary, it seems most in accord with analogy to believe that just
   as the Lord Jesus will yet combine these offices and functions, so the
   pseudo christ will fill this double role. [14] It is true there will be
   two Satanic characters on earth during the Tribulation period and the
   second of these if brought before us in the second "Beast" of Rev. 13.
   This second Beast we regard as the "False Prophet" of Rev. 19:20;
   20:10. He is the third person in the Trinity of Evil. That the Second
   Beast of Rev. 13 is Satan's parody of the Holy Spirit (the Third Person
   in the Holy Trinity) rather than of Christ Himself, seems clear from
   what is here predicted of him. Just as the Holy Spirit "speaks not of
   Himself" (John 16:13) but is here to glorify Christ, so the second
   Beast causes men to worship the first Beast. And just as the advent of
   the Holy Spirit was accompanied by the descent of tongues of fire (Acts
   2:3), so this second Beast "maketh fire come down from heaven on the
   earth in the sight of men" (13:13). Finally, that the second Beast (and
   not the first) is the "False Prophet" is abundantly clear from Rev.
   19:20 where we are told, "And the Beast was taken, and with him the
   False Prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived
   them that had received the mark of the Beast, and them that worshipped
   his image." The marks of identity here are so plain that it seems
   impossible to mistake them. In Rev. 13 it is the second Beast that
   "deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles
   which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast;" and here in Rev.
   19 it is the False Prophet that is said to have "wrought miracles
   before him" with which he deceived the Beast's worshipers. Hence we
   unhesitatingly affirm that the False Prophet is the Second Beast of
   Rev. 13.

   We do not now attempt a full interpretation of the symbolical
   description of the Anti-christ contained in what is said above of the
   first Beast, a hint here and there is all we shall essay. The
   Anti-christ will combine in his personality the characteristics of the
   leopard (beauty and subtlety) of the bear (strength and cruelty), and
   of the lion (boldness and ferocity). He will be vested with full power
   and authority from Satan as the Lord Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit.
   He will compel the admiration of the whole world and will be
   universally worshipped. He will be a warrior of international renown
   and none will be able to resist his terrible power. But his career will
   be cut short: after his rise to full power only forty-two months, or
   three and a half years, will be allowed him by God.

   Putting together the various Scriptures at which we have little more
   than glanced, we learn that the Anti-christ will be a supernatural
   being--the Son of Perdition; that he will be revealed subsequent to the
   departure of the Holy Spirit from the earth (which occurs at the
   Rapture of the saints); that he will be the greatest soul-destroyer
   that has ever trod this earth. He will be the Super-Man for whom the
   world is already looking. He will personify all the godless culture of
   the last days, and will be endowed with a supernatural wisdom. He will
   be the consummation of vileness--"the Wicked One;" he will be the
   personification of evil--"the Man of Sin;" he will be the incarnation
   of the Devil--"the Son of Perdition." He will pose as the Christ of God
   and will substantiate his claims by performing wonderful miracles. He
   will be welcomed and cordially received by all Christendom. He will
   utterly deceive the majority of the Jews who will hail him as their
   long-expected Messiah. He will rule over a restored Roman Empire thus
   travestying Christ who, in the Millennium, will sit as a priest upon
   His throne. He will be a warrior of world-wide renown, a statesman of
   unrivaled skill, a man of transcendent genius, before whom the exploits
   of Caesar, Charlemagne and Napoleon will appear trifling. Kings will be
   his toys and thrones his playthings. Toward the close of his reign he
   will throw off his mask, no longer assuming to be the real Christ, but
   standing forth in his own colors he will deny both God the Father and
   God the Son, will seek to exterminate the Jews and everything else
   which bears witness to the living God; will set up his own image in the
   rebuilt Temple at Jerusalem, and under pain of death will compel all to
   worship it and receive his mark upon their bodies. But he will meet
   with summary judgment at the end, as we shall yet see. We turn now to
   consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

   [13] It is further to be noted that the Anti-christ is twice termed
   "Death and Hades" (Is. 28:18; Rev. 6:8) as if to intimate he came from
   Hades the place which receives the souls of the dead.

   [14] See "Appendix" P. 397.

  5. The Situation of the Jews during this Period.

   As we have seen in earlier chapters, the declarations of Holy Writ make
   it very clear that Israel will yet be restored to God's favor and be
   rehabilitated in Palestine. But before that glad time arrives, the Jews
   have to pass through a season of sore trouble and affliction, during
   which God severely chastises them for their sins and punishes them for
   the rejection and crucifixion of their Messiah. Fearful indeed have
   been the past experiences of "the nation of the weary feet" but a
   darker path than ever yet lies before them. Their cruel bondage in
   Egypt, their captivity in Babylon, and their grievous handling by
   Titus, were but faint foreshadowings of what they shall yet be called
   upon to undergo. In Jer. 30:4-7 we read--"And these are the words that
   the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. For thus saith
   the Lord; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of
   peace. Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
   wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in
   travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? Alas! for that day is
   great, so that none is like it: it is even the Time of Jacob's trouble;
   but he shall be saved out of it." This Time of Jacob's Troubles was
   described in part when, in answer to His disciples' question concerning
   the end of the age, our Lord said, "Then shall they deliver you up to
   be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations
   for My name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray
   one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall
   arise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the
   love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end (of
   the Tribulation period which terminates the Age), the same shall be
   saved" (Matt. 24:9-13).

   It has also been pointed out that considerable numbers of the Jews have
   recently turned their faces Zionward and returned to the land of their
   fathers, but before the revelation and rise of the Anti-christ to
   temporal power, many others will also have returned to Palestine. This
   is clear from Dan. 9:27, where we learn that Anti-christ (the "prince"
   or head of the restored Roman Empire) will ratify a treaty with Israel
   for seven years, under which he guarantees them protection and allows
   them to rebuild their Temple and restore its ancient ritual. It is to
   this Covenant between Anti-christ and the Jews that Is. 28:18 refers,
   "And your covenant with Death (a title of Anti-christ, in
   contradistinction to the true Christ who is "the Life") shall be
   disannulled, and your agreement with Hell shall not stand; when the
   overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down
   by it (probably a reference to Zech. 14:1, 2).** For the Lord shall
   rise up as in mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the valley of
   Gibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass
   His act, His strange act." It is to be noted that this "Covenant"
   between Anti-christ and Israel is established during the early part of
   his reign, or certainly, at the very commencement of Daniel's
   seventieth week (see Dan. 9:24-27--a most important passage), while he
   is posing as the true Christ and before he throws off his mask and
   denies both the Father and the Son. It is in the midst of this final
   seven years that he openly defied heaven and earth, breaks his covenant
   with the Jews in Palestine, causes their sacrifices to cease and in
   their place demands that they shall set up an image to himself which,
   like Nebuchadnezzar and his image, he will require to be worshipped by
   all under pain of death. It is to the setting up of this "image" in the
   Temple that our Lord had reference when He said, "When ye therefore
   shall see the abomination of desolation (for the meaning of
   "abomination" see 1 Kings 11:5-7--it is an "image" to a false god),
   spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whose
   readeth, let him understand). Then let them which be in Judea flee into
   the mountains: Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take
   anything out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field return
   back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to
   them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not
   in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day: For then shall be (the)
   great Tribulation such as was not from the beginning of the world to
   this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be
   shortened, there should no flesh he saved: but for the elect's sake
   (i.e. for the sake of the godly Jewish remnant) those days shall be
   shortened." The above Scripture is a warning from our Lord to the godly
   Jews who will be on earth subsequent to the Rapture of the Church, and
   who are informed that when they see Anti-christ's image set up in their
   re-built Temple then let them know the time for the outpouring of God's
   wrath is at hand. The part of wisdom for them in that day will be to
   flee from Jerusalem lest they share its judgment. Be it noted it is
   those who read--i.e., the Holy Scriptures, and particularly Daniel and
   the Revelation who will "understand." Following this timely warning--by
   which, doubtless, many godly Jews will profit in that day--our Lord
   continues, "Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
   there; believe it not. For there shall arise false christs and false
   prophets (observe false "prophets" as well as false christs; and note
   the order--false christs which is headed up in the Anti-christ the
   first "beast" of Rev. 13, and "false prophets" which is headed up in
   the False Prophet the second "beast" of Rev. 13!), and shall show great
   signs and wonders (even make the "image" speak, see Rev. 13:15;
   insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect
   (but it will not be possible, for the elect will "read" and
   "understand"). Behold, I have told you before" (vss. 23-25).

   A small minority of the Jews (typified by the three "Hebrew children"
   in the days of Nebuchadnezzar), a godly remnant, will refuse to receive
   the Beast and worship his image and, in consequence, will be subjected
   to fierce persecution. This pious "remnant" forms the subject of
   numerous Old Testament prophecies. We single out but one--"In that day
   (the Tribulation period) shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
   wherein thou hast transgressed against Me: for then I will take away
   out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt
   no more be haughty because of My holy mountain. I will also leave in
   the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in
   the name of the Lord. The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor
   speak lies (profess allegiance to The Lie): for they shall feed and lie
   down, and none shall make them afraid"(Zech. 3:11-13, and cf. Is.
   10:20, 21; Joel 2:32; 3:1, 2 etc.). Many of the Jews who comprise this
   remnant will be slain by the Anti-christ, but at least 144,000 of them
   (see Rev. 7) will be miraculously preserved by God. Jehovah will
   undertake for them as He did for the three "Hebrew children" of old.
   Then it shall be seen that "He that dwelleth in the secret place
   (compare Rev. 12:6!!) of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of
   the Almighty." Then will they find the Lord their "refuge" and
   "fortress." And then will be fulfilled His promise--"Surely He shall
   deliver thee from the Snare of the Fowler (the Anti-christ), and from
   the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers and under
   His wings shalt thou trust." And then will they behold with their eyes
   and "see the reward of the Wicked One" (see the whole of Ps. 91). Many
   of the Psalms record the experiences and prayers of the godly Jewish
   remnant during this period: see Psalms 10 (which vividly pictures the
   Anti-christ), 37 (which contains words of admonition and encouragement
   for them; see especially verse 10!) 43 (note verse 1!), 44 (which
   reveals their hope in God, 55 (and note particularly verses 20, 21!),
   74 (and note verse 10!), 80 (their cry for deliverance, etc.) We may
   add that many of the later Psalms view Israel in the Millennium.

   It is during the Tribulation period that Elijah the prophet returns to
   the earth and Mal. 4:5, 6 is fulfilled--"Behold, I will send you Elijah
   the prophet before the coming the the great and dreadful day of the
   Lord (i.e. before the final three and a half years); and he shall turn
   the heart of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the
   children to their fathers." Doubtless Elijah is one of the "two
   witnesses" of Rev. 11 who testify for God twelve hundred and sixty days
   in Jerusalem; after which they are slain, resurrected, and translated
   to heaven. At the close of the Tribulation period Anti-christ marshals
   his forces and goes up to besiege Jerusalem, and this leads us to
   consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

  6. The Battle of Armageddon.

   The Battle of Armageddon! What extravagant speculations have been
   indulged concerning it! What unscriptural theories have been
   entertained respecting it! To begin with; this appears from the term
   employed. Nowhere in the Bible do we read of "The Battle of
   Armageddon." The Scriptural expression is "The Battle of that great day
   of God Almighty" (Rev. 16:14). This Battle of the great day of God
   Almighty will bring the Tribulation period to a close and will witness
   the return of Christ to the earth to usher in the Millennium. This
   "Battle" is the subject of numerous prophecies, several of which we
   shall briefly examine.

   The Battle of that great day of God Almighty will terminate the most
   blatant movement of all in the impious career of the Anti-christ. After
   he has thrown off the mask, denied both the Father and the Son and
   openly defied Heaven, he will seek to exterminate everything which
   either directly or indirectly witnesses to God. His first effort in
   this direction is brought before us in Rev. 17:16--"And the ten horns
   which thou sawest upon the Beast (the "ten kings" vs. 12), these shall
   hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat
   her flesh, and burn her with fire"--in other words, completely abolish
   her. Who this "whore" is we learn in the previous verses. It is
   "Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of harlots and abominations of
   the earth" (vs. 5). It is the Papacy, which before this time will have
   succeeded in gathering within its fold the whole of apostate
   Christendom. After the Rapture of the Church, the whole of Christendom
   will render allegiance to the Pope who will still claim to be Christ's
   "vicar" on earth. Then it is that "the whole" of the three measures of
   meal will be completely leavened (Matt. 13:33). At first, Christendom
   (the "Whore") will be supported by the Beast (Rev. 17:3), but at the
   end he will turn against her and cause his ten satellites to bring
   about her destruction. Having accomplished the destruction of the one
   system in Europe which still professed the name of Christ, the Son of
   Perdition will then turn his attention toward Palestine where the last
   witness of God on earth will be found. The godly remnant of the Jews
   will still refuse to worship him. This enrages the Beast and he gathers
   together his forces and leads them against the Holy Land in a
   determined attempt to annihilate those who dare to defy him, in fact it
   would seem from several Scriptures that the Gentiles headed by the Man
   of Sin will aim at the complete destruction of all of David's
   descendants. Unknown to himself, however, he will be but carrying out
   the eternal purpose of God--"Now also many nations are gathered against
   thee (the daughter of Zion), that say, Let her be defiled, and let our
   eye look upon Zion, But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither
   understand they His counsel, for He shall gather them as the sheaves
   into the floor" (Micah 4:11, 12). The time for God to take vengeance on
   the nations who have flocked to the banner of the Anti-christ has come,
   and He employs the Beast to concentrate his forces so that He may pour
   out His wrath upon them--"Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare
   war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them
   come up: Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks
   into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble yourselves, and
   come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about:
   thither cause thy might ones to come down, O Lord. Let the heathen be
   wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit
   to judge all the heathen round about. Put ye in the sickle for the
   harvest is ripe: come, get you down: for the press is full, the fats
   overflow; for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the
   valley of decision. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the
   stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord also shall roar out of
   Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth
   shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of His people, and the
   strength of the children of Israel. So shall ye know that I am the Lord
   your God dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be
   holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more" (Joel
   3:9-17).

   But to go back a little. Unknown to himself, it is the Lord, who shall
   cause the Anti-christ to assemble his forces in Palestine where they
   shall both meet their just doom. But at first the evil project of the
   Beast will appear to succeed. He besieges Jerusalem and captures
   it--"Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided
   in the midst of thee. For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem
   to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the
   women ravished: and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and
   the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city" (Zech.
   14:1, 2). Jerusalem falls and its people are led forth captives. The
   success of the Anti-christ seems complete. The last witness against the
   Beast now appears to be silenced. But his triumph will be short-lived.
   As the above prophecy continues, "Then shall the Lord go forth, and
   fight against those nations, as when He fought in the day of battle.
   And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is
   before Jerusalem" (vss. 3, 4). The Anti-christ has now to meet One with
   whom he cannot cope, yet, incredible as it may appear, he will make the
   attempt. Just as of old, Pharaoh gathered his chariots together and
   went forth against Israel, though he knew that Jehovah was with them,
   so shall his great Anti-type gather his forces to "make war with the
   Lamb" (Rev. 17:14). The last desperate movement of the Beast will be a
   determined effort to prevent the Lord Jesus returning to the earth
   itself. It is to this Psalm 2 refers--"Why do the nations tumultuously
   assemble, and the people meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth
   set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord,
   and against His Christ, saying, Let us break Their bands asunder, and
   cast away Their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall
   laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak unto
   them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I set
   My King upon My holy hill of Zion" (vss. 1-6). God is about to set His
   King upon Mount Zion, and the Anti-christ will gather all of his forces
   together in the vain attempt to frustrate the Divine purpose. At the
   head of his armies, the Beast marches forth in open hostility against
   God--"And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
   tongue Armageddon" (Rev. 16:16) which is explained in Rev. 19:19--"And
   I saw the Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered
   together to make war against Him that sat on the horse, and against His
   army." The daring challenge of the Beast is accepted. The heavens open
   and Christ appears in flaming fire (cf. Matt. 24:27) ready to take
   vengeance. As it is written, "In that day will I make Jerusalem a
   burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it
   shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered
   together against it. In that day, saith the Lord, I will smite every
   horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open
   Mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the
   people with blindness. In that day shall the Lord defend the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem (i.e. the "residue" of 14:2); and he that is
   feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David
   shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them. And it shall
   come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations
   that come against Jerusalem" (Zech. 12:3, 4, 6-9). How all this will be
   accomplished we shall see under our last heading, namely,
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. The Return of Christ to the earth itself.

   If to-day the presence of the Lord on earth is urgently needed, how
   much greater will be this need at the close of the Tribulation period!
   The Anti-christ in full power, openly blaspheming and blatantly defying
   God! All the world worshipping this Son of Perdition and branded with
   his mark on their foreheads or in their hands as token of their
   allegiance to him! The godly remnant of the Jews in the very last
   extremity and crying, "Keep not Thou silence, O God: hold not Thy
   peace, and be not still O God. For, lo, Thine enemies make a tumult:
   and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty
   counsel against Thy people, and consulted against Thy hidden ones (the
   remnant in the "secret place" of Ps. 91:1; the "prepared place" of Rev.
   12:6). They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
   nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they
   have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against
   Thee" (Ps. 83:1-5! All the forces of the Beast gathered together in a
   last daring effort to prevent the Lord Jesus coming back to this earth
   and entering into His inheritance! But now has struck the appointed
   hour of retribution. Now shall the Lord come "with ten thousands of His
   saints to execute judgment upon all" (Jude 14:15). Yes, "The Lord Jesus
   shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire
   taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
   Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; Who shall be punished with everlasting
   destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His
   power" (2 Thess. 1:7-9).

   A full length picture of our returning Lord is found in Rev. 19, a
   picture awful in its solemnity and fearful in its vividness. Let us sit
   down before it and study it in detail. "And I saw Heaven opened, and
   behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and
   True, and in righteousness He doth judge and make war" (Rev. 19:11).
   Every word here calls for close attention.

   Our Lord comes seated upon a "white horse."

   The Greek word intimates a-war-horse or "charger." Note its color. In
   Scripture, colors are used emblematically. Here, "white" is the fitting
   emblem of the Rider's spotless purity and unsullied holiness.
   Everything in the passage we are now examining is in marked contrast to
   our Lord's first Advent. Then He was seen, meek and lowly, seated upon
   the back of an ass. But now He is coming back to the earth for a
   different work from that which He performed when He was here before. He
   returns now for the purpose of subduing wickedness, to destroy evil
   doers, to overthrow Anti-christ and to remove Satan from these scenes.
   Hence, in keeping with His mission, He appears seated upon a white
   war-charger! "Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most Mighty, with Thy
   glory and Thy majesty. And in Thy majesty ride prosperously, because of
   truth and meekness and righteousness; and Thy right hand shall teach
   thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's
   enemies; whereby the people fall under Thee. Thy throne, O God, is for
   ever and ever: the scepter of Thy Kingdom is a right scepter" (Ps.
   45:3-6).

   He Comes as the "Faithful and True."

   This is in vivid contrast from the abounding unfaithfulness of men. He
   comes now faithful to His promises and true to His threatenings.
   To-day, men may single out those parts of His teachings which accord
   with their own sentiments, and reject and deny His solemn threatenings
   of judgment against the unbelieving; but, in that day, it shall be seen
   that He is Faithful and True to every word He uttered, whether of
   promise or of threatening.

   He comes back again as "Judge."

   Here we have another striking contrast. When he was here before, wicked
   men dared to arraign Him. He was brought before the judgment-bar of
   Caiaphas, Pilate, and Herod. But now the tables shall be turned. He
   Himself shall be the Judge. God hath "appointed a day in the which He
   will judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He hath
   ordained" (Acts 17:31). And now the appointed "Day" (the Millennium)
   has dawned; the ordained Man is at hand. Observe it is said, "In
   righteousness He doth judge" (Rev. 19:11). This also points a contrast.
   He was judged un-righteously. No charge could be preferred against Him.
   He was guiltless; even His judge had to acknowledge "I find no fault in
   Him;" and yet he sentenced Him to death! How un-righteous! But in
   marked contrast, our Lord shall judge "in righteousness:" nought but
   Justice shall He dispense.

   He comes to make war!

   Ah! once our blessed Lord ministered to the needy, fed the hungering
   multitude, healed the sick, gave peace to the burdened conscience.
   Beforetime, He invited the heavy-laden to come to Him for rest. But
   here all is changed. Now He comes seated upon a war-charger, and with
   the express purpose of making war. At the Red Sea, where Jehovah
   destroyed Pharaoh, and his hosts, Israel sang "The Lord is a Man of
   War" (Ex. 15:3), and now has struck the hour when this shall be
   demonstrated as never before. He returns to earth with the deliberate
   design of shedding the blood of His enemies.

   "And His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many
   crowns; and He had a name written that no man knew, but He Himself. And
   He was clothed in a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is called the
   Word of God" (Rev. 19:12, 13).

   He comes with flashing and flaming eyes.

   When He was upon earth before, those eyes had oft-times shone with
   tenderness, as when the children were attracted to Him; had glowed with
   compassion, as when a single look upon guilty Peter melted his heart
   and caused him to go out and weep bitterly; yea, they had been filled
   with tears, as when He stood by the graveside of Lazarus and when He
   wept over the Jerusalem which had rejected Him. But here they flash and
   flame like fire. Now shall they be seen as the eyes of One who is
   thoroughly aroused with holy indignation. But not only do those flaming
   eyes express His anger, they also show forth His omniscience. Those
   flaming eyes shall pierce through every veil of hypocrisy and scorch
   into the very soul of His enemies. They will act as a veritable
   searchlight, penetrating to the thoughts and intents of the heart.

   He comes with head decked with many crowns.

   This, again, is in vivid contrast to the days of old. Once that holy
   brow was covered with sweat of agony so intense that it was as it were
   great drops of blood. Once that head was crowned with thorns--the
   symbol of the Curse. But here it shall be crowned with glory and honor.
   He comes forth now, not as the lowly Sufferer, but as the victorious
   Conquer vested with complete authority. "Many crowns" observe, for in
   that day He shall be King not only of the Jews, but King of the
   Gentiles as well--King of kings. All the world shall then be compelled
   to bow before Him and submit to His universal sovereignty.

   He comes with a Name known to none save Himself.

   In Scripture names express nature--what a person or thing is. So here.
   Christ has a name which no creature can fathom. That is to say, His
   Person is incomprehensible; there are mysterious depths in Him which no
   finite mind can grasp.

   He comes with a vesture dipped in blood.

   At first sight this seems to suggest a comparison rather than a
   contrast, but the verses which follow show that it is another of those
   sharp antitheses with which this passage abounds. Once His raiment had
   been crimsoned by the flowing of His own blood, but now, alas! it is
   from the blood of others. He was lifted up that men might shed His
   blood, but now He descends that He might shed their blood.

   He comes, denominated the Word of God.

   We are told this so that there may be no possibility of mistaking Him.
   This title serves to identify Him and connects the two Advents. He is
   here designated by His Eternal and Divine name. "In the beginning was
   the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1).
   He is no longer called by His name "Jesus" which means "Saviour," but
   is termed "the Word of God" which points to the dignity, majesty, and
   glory of His Person. The use of this Divine title in the present
   connection is deeply significant. When He was here before He came in
   weakness and shame: it was His Humanity that was most prominent; but
   when He comes back again to this earth, He shall return in irresistible
   power and great glory, and His Deity will be most conspicuous.

   "And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite
   the nations: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron; and He treadeth
   the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He hath
   on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord
   of Lords" (Rev. 19:15, 16).

   He comes to smite the nations with a Sword that goeth out of His mouth.

   Here again we have another contrast. When He was here before, He spoke
   words of blessing and cheer: He came not to judge the world, but that
   the world through Him might be saved. But now all is changed. The
   "Sword" which proceedeth out of His mouth is the Word of God (Heb.
   4:12). Throughout the centuries of this Dispensation He has sent forth
   His Word that it may slay sin in men, but in that day He shall send His
   word that it may slay men in sin. In the days of His humiliation, His
   mouth was opened to bless men, now it shall be opened to curse and slay
   them. It is the fulfillment of Isaiah 11:4--"And He shall smite the
   earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips shall
   He slay the wicked." It marks the ease with which He performs His
   purposes: he speaks, and it is done; He gives the command, and it is
   accomplished. Something of this was pre-intimated on the occasion of
   His arrest in the Garden (John 18). When the soldiers came to take Him,
   He said, "Whom seek ye?" and they replied, "Jesus of Nazareth," and we
   read, "Jesus said unto them. I am** and as soon as He had said unto
   them I am, they went backward and fell to the ground"! If so mild an
   utterance prostrated His enemies then, what will it be when He girds
   Himself for judgment!

   He comes to rule the nations with a Rod of Iron.

   How different this is to the popular conception of the "Gentle Jesus"!
   Human sentimentality has pictured our blessed Lord as being so tender
   that He will never find in His heart to punish sin and slay the workers
   of iniquity. For the most part, the world today hears from the pulpit
   only a one-sided presentation of the character of God--that side which
   is most agreeable to man in his fallen condition. But God is not only
   Love, He is Light; not only is He Merciful; He is Holy and Righteous.
   Because He is holy He cannot ignore sin, yea, "He can by no means clear
   the guilty." The claims of His Throne must be maintained, even though a
   thousand worlds be destroyed. Long has God dealt with our race in
   wondrous grace and infinite patience, and evilly have men repaid Him.
   But when Christ returns to the earth, the Dispensation of grace will
   have ended and He comes back, no longer inviting voluntary allegiance,
   but to compel obedience. The insignia of the returning Lord shall be
   the Iron Rod. Iron was the symbol and emblem of the Roman Empire, and
   stood for restless power, rigid rule, and indomitable government.
   History shows us what it meant to be crushed beneath "the iron heel of
   the Romans." And "iron," the Iron Rod and rule, will be the fitting
   emblem of Christ's government in that day when He returns to crush the
   head of the Serpent, subdue His enemies and put down all opposition.

   He comes to tread the Winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty
   God.

   This is the fulfillment of the prophetic word of Isaiah--"Who is this
   that goeth from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is
   glorious in His apparel, travelling in the greatness of His strength? I
   that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore are Thou red in
   Thine apparel, and Thy garments like Him that treadeth the winepress? I
   have troden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with
   Me: for I will tread them in Mine anger, and trample them in My fury;
   and their blood shall be sprinkled upon My garments, and I will stain
   all My raiment. For the day of vengeance is in Mine heart, and the year
   of My redeemed is come.** And I will tread down the people in Mine
   anger, and make them drunk in My fury, and I will bring down their
   strength to the earth" (Is. 63:1-6). Unspeakably dreadful will be the
   carnage for we are told, "The winepress was trodden without the city
   (Jerusalem) and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horses
   bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs" (that is,
   200 miles!) (Rev. 14:20). Yes, terrible shall be the slaughter, but who
   shall say it was not fully merited and demanded. Mercy had been
   slighted and abused. A "murderer" had again been preferred above the
   Lord of life. God Himself was being openly blasphemed. And now the
   Executioner steps forth. This is the hour promised Him by the Father,
   that His enemies shall be made His "footstool" (Ps. 110:1)!

   He comes followed by "armies."

   "And the armies which were in Heaven followed Him upon white horses
   clothed in fine linen, white and clean" (Rev. 19:14). The "armies" that
   follow the Divine Warrior will be made up by both the Old Testament and
   New Testament saints. Those armies are not "angels" as some teach,
   though these "armies" will certainly be accompanied by angels as we
   learn from 2 Thess. 1:7. That the "armies" are not angels appears from
   Jude 14, where those who accompany the Captain of their salvation are
   denominated "saints" a term which is never applied to angels; and also
   from Rev. 17:14, where those that are "with Him" are styled "called and
   chosen and faithful"--language which is applicable to none save the
   children of God. The saints who are one with Christ, then made "like
   Him," will fully share His feelings and participate in His victory,
   though He alone will do the fighting.

   He comes to overthrow the Anti-christ and his legions.

   The issue of this battle, the Battle of that great day of God Almighty
   (popularly but unscripturally called "Armageddon") is never in doubt.
   Its issue is fore-announced. A call is given to the fowls of the air to
   devour the carcasses of the slain before the battle begins--"And I saw
   an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice saying to
   all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather
   yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; That ye may eat
   the flesh of Kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty
   men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the
   flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great" (Rev.
   19:17, 18). It is to this same terrible event the prophet Ezekiel bore
   witness, "Thus saith the Lord God; Speak unto the feathered fowl, and
   to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather
   yourselves on every side to My slaughter that I do sacrifice for you,
   even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat
   flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink
   the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats,
   of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan. And ye shall eat fat till
   ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of My sacrifice which I
   have sacrificed for you. Thus ye shall be filled at My table with
   horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith
   the Lord God. And I will set My glory among the heathen, and all the
   heathen shall see My judgment that I have executed, and My hand that I
   have laid upon them. So the house of Israel shall know that I am the
   Lord their God from that day and forward" (Ezek. 39:17-22). But to
   continue, and complete our review of Rev. 19.

   "And I saw the Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies,
   gathered together to make war against Him that sat on the horse, and
   against His army. And the Beast was taken, and with him the False
   Prophet that wrought miracles before him, and with which he deceived
   them that had received the mark of the Beast, and them that worshipped
   his image. Those both were cast alive into the Lake of Fire burning
   with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of Him that
   sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of His mouth: and all the
   fowls were filled with their flesh" (Rev. 19:19-21). Comment is
   needless. The Anti-christ and the False Prophet are both cast into the
   Lake of Fire where, a thousand years later, Satan shall join them. [15]
   The awful but richly deserved fate which overtakes the armies of the
   Anti-christ is dramatically portrayed in Zech. 14--"And this shall be
   the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have
   fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they
   stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their
   holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. And it shall
   come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord shall be
   among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his
   neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his
   neighbour" (vss. 12, 13). Thus will end the present Age. What a
   termination! What a climax! What consummation of wickedness! This is
   the goal--now so near at hand--toward which all our boasted
   enlightenment, progress, and civilization is headed. The end will
   witness all Christendom (minus the Body of Christ, previously raptured)
   in organized and open revolt and rebellion against Almighty God, to be
   utterly destroyed at the Redeemer's Return.

                   The Consummation Of The Redeemer's Return

                                       or

                              The Millennial Reign

   It should now be evident to every unprejudiced reader that there are
   two distinct stages in the Second Coming of Christ:--His coming to the
   air, and His coming to the earth; His coming for the saints, and His
   coming with the saints. The first great purpose before Him in
   connection with His return is to receive His people unto Himself. Just
   as of old God translated Enoch to Heaven before He sent the Deluge upon
   the ungodly, so will the Church be removed from this earth before the
   vials of His wrath are poured out upon it. The second great purpose
   before the Lord Jesus will be to return to the earth itself, there to
   set up His Kingdom and reign in righteousness, and it is the nature,
   the scope, the blessedness, and the duration of this Kingdom-reign
   which is now to engage our attention.

   In popular parlance the era of the Messiah's reign is referred to as
   the "Millennium" which is a compound word signifying a thousand years.
   From the remotest antiquity men have longed for and talked of a Golden
   Age, of an age in which righteousness and peace should prevail, and
   oppression and war should cease. Poets have sung of it, politicians
   have dreamed about it, and inspired prophets have described it. This
   era of blessedness is variously denominated in the Scriptures. It is
   termed "the Regeneration" (Matt. 19:28); the "Last Day" (John 6:40);
   the "Times of Refreshing" (Acts 3:19); the "Times of Restitution" (Acts
   3:21); the "Kingdom" (1 Cor. 15:24); the "day of Christ" (Phil. 1:6);
   the "Dispensation of the Fullness of Times" (Eph. 1:10).

   There are more Scriptures which treat of the Millennium or Kingdom-age
   than perhaps any other one subject in the Bible. The difficulty is to
   classify them all. For purpose of simplification we shall now consider
   the Millennium under seven heads, namely, the Millennium in relation to
   Satan, to Christ, to the Church, to Israel, to the World, to Creation,
   and to Sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  1. The millennium in relation to Satan.

   In our last chapter we saw that Christ descends from Heaven to find an
   organized effort to prevent him coming back to the earth. Under the
   leadership of Anti-christ, the kings of the earth with their armies
   assemble together at Armageddon with the express purpose of making war
   upon the Lamb (Rev. 17:14). It is in connection with this impious
   revolt that we read, "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh" (Ps.
   2:4), laugh at their folly and madness, "The Lord shall have them in
   derision." As well might a worm seek to resist the tread of an elephant
   as the creature hope to succeed against the Almighty. As well attempt
   to roll back the ocean as aim to frustrate the counsels of the Most
   High. "For the Lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall dis-annul it?
   and His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?" (Is.
   14:27). A short work will our Lord make of the proud rebels--"And the
   Beast was taken, and with him the False Prophet that wrought miracles
   before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of
   the Beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast
   alive into the Lake of Fire burning with brimstone" (Rev. 19:19). This
   accounts for two of the persons in the Trinity of Evil. But one other
   still remains to be dealt with. Before the Messiah's Kingdom can be set
   up, the great Usurper must first be cast out.

   There can be no thousand years of righteousness and peace on earth
   while the great Enemy of God and man is at large. Post-millenarians,
   who expect the Kingdom to be brought in by the preaching of the Gospel
   and the activities of the Church, and Peace-idealists and
   Social-reformers who look for a Golden Age to be brought about by
   legislation and civilization, all leave out of their schemes and
   considerations one dominating factor, namely, the Devil. Behind all
   anti-christian systems back of all the inveterate opposition to the
   Gospel, beneath all the evil and wickedness which stalks rampant
   through the earth, is that old Serpent, the Devil. And nothing finite
   can remove him. Nothing human can disturb him. None on earth can bind
   him. Man is incompetent to cope with his mighty adversary. Legislation
   cannot reach him, and the Church is powerless to rid the world of his
   awful presence. The only One who is mightier than he, is God--the
   Almighty, and there can be no Golden Age, until the Son of God Himself
   returns in person and removes and imprisons the Arch-Foe.

   The removal of Satan from this earth is described in Rev. 20:1-3, "and
   I saw an angel [16] come down from heaven, having the key of the
   Bottomless Pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the
   Dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him
   a thousand years, and cast him into the Bottomless Pit, and shut him
   up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no
   more, till the thousand years shall be fulfilled." Satan will be
   "bound" which is the fulfillment of our Lord's word in Matt.
   12:29--"How can one enter a "strong man's house, and spoil his goods,
   except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house."
   The "strong man" is our , the Devil' his "house" is the children of
   this world, in contradistinction to the children of God who are the
   "House" of Christ (Heb. 3:6); the "binding" of the Strong Man is
   described in the Passage quoted above from Rev. 20; the "spoiling of
   his house" is the delivering of his captives (see Is. 42:7). Satan will
   be "cast into the Bottomless Pit" which is the fulfillment of Is.
   14--"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
   how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations! For
   thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into Heaven, I will exalt
   my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
   congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the
   heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be
   brought down to Hell, to the sides of the Pit" (vss. 12-15). Satan will
   be shut up in the Bottomless Pit and a "seal" shall be set upon him,
   which is God's answer to that which we read of in Matt. 27:66, "So they
   went and made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone, and setting a
   watch--what he has sown that he also reap. Thus will terminate that
   struggle which has lasted for six thousand years, a struggle which has
   been waged for the dominion of the earth.

   At last the "roaring lion" (1 Peter 5:8) will have been overcome,
   overcome by the Lion of the tribe of Judah. The Man with the bruised
   heel will have crushed the Serpent's head, and the word spoken in Eden
   will then be fully accomplished. And who can describe or even imagine
   the blessed consequences! No more shall the brethren be accused before
   God (Rev. 12:10). No more shall the daughters of Abraham be "bound, lo,
   these eighteen years" (Luke 13:16). No more shall satan tempt and try,
   harass and hinder the saints of God. For a thousand years the earth
   shall be rid of the Evil One and in his place there shall come "Times
   of Refreshing from the presence of the Lord." And this leads us to
   consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] We believe this "angel" to be the Lord Jesus Himself--the
   uncreated Angel of the Covenant (Mal. 3:1). If it should be asked, Why
   term Him an angel? the answer is, To connect Him with Israel, the
   covenant and earthly people. See Gen. 22:15, 16; 48:16; Ex. 3:2; and
   compare Rev. 7:2, 3; 8:3; 10:1.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2. The Millennium in relation to Christ.

   It has been divinely ordained that our Lord should fill three great
   offices--the Prophetic, the Priestly, and the Kingly. As Prophet, He
   acts as God's Spokesman: revealing God's mind, communicating God's
   will, unveiling God's heart. As Priest, He acts as Mediator between God
   and men, and by means of His atoning sacrifice He reconciles believers
   to God, represents His peoples' interests before God, interceding for
   them and pleading their cause. As King, He will reign over men,
   enforcing God's laws, and upholding on earth the claims of His Throne.
   It is of Christ as King we shall now speak.

   Toward the close of David's reign, the word of the Lord came to Nathan,
   bidding him go to the king and, among other things, tell him, "And when
   thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will
   set up thy Seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and
   I will establish His Kingdom. He shall build an house for My name, and
   I will establish the throne of His Kingdom for ever" (2 Sam. 7:12, 13).
   At a later date, in one of the great Messianic prophecies, it was
   announced concerning our Lord that "His name shall be called Wonderful,
   Counsellor, The Mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
   Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no
   end, upon the throne of David, and upon His Kingdom, to order it, and
   to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for
   ever" (Is. 9:6, 7). Hence it is that the very first verse of the New
   Testament reads, "The Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son
   of David, (thus linking Him with Israel's throne) the son of Abraham."

   Just before our Lord was born, an angel appeared unto Mary and said,
   "And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son,
   and shalt call His name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called
   the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne
   of His father David: and He shall reign over the House of Jacob for
   ever: and of His Kingdom there shall be no end" (Luke 1:30-33).

   Sometime during our Lord's infancy certain wise men, who were led by a
   star, came to Jerusalem (the royal city), asking, "Where is He that is
   born King of the Jews?" (Matt. 2:2). Our Lord, then, was born King of
   the Jews, but as the inspired Word informs us, "He came unto His own,
   and His own received Him not" (John 1:11). Israel would not own Him;
   instead, they cried, "We have no king but Caesar" (John 19:15). And
   when Pilate wrote an inscription and placed it over the Cross--"This is
   Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews," they desired him to alter it
   and substitute, "He said I am King of the Jews" (John 19:21), which is
   further proof that the Jews had rejected Him as their King.

   It was announced then, in Old Testament prophecy, and confirmed by the
   angel to Mary, that our Lord should occupy the throne of David. In
   order to the fulfillment of this our Lord, according to the flesh,
   sprang from one who was a lineal descendant of David, and therefore, He
   was born "King of the Jews." But as we have seen, Israel rejected their
   King and crucified Him. And what we now desire to emphasize is, that,
   Jesus Christ has never yet assumed the Kingship! On the contrary, He
   taught His disciples to pray, "Thy Kingdom come." Furthermore, He said,
   "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for Himself a
   Kingdom, and to return.** And it came to pass that when He was
   returned, having received the Kingdom" etc. (Luke 19:12-15). Christ's
   receiving of the Kingdom and His return synchronize (cf. 2 Tim. 4:1).
   Christ, then, is not King today, for He has not yet received the
   Kingdom, nor has He yet occupied the throne of His father David.
   Nowhere in the Epistles do we find Him denominated "The King of the
   Church." Jesus Christ is Saviour of the Church, Lord of the Church,
   Head of the Church, but He is not King of the Church, for He has not
   yet entered upon His Kingly office, and He will not do so until the
   beginning of the Millennium. In the Millennium Christ will rule and
   reign over the earth, not only as King of the Jews, but as King of
   kings and Lord of lords. It is then that the prophecy of Zechariah
   shall be fulfilled "And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in
   that day (a yet future day--see the context) shall there be one Lord,
   and His name one" (Zech. 14:9). Our Lord's Kingship over all the earth
   leads us to the consideration of another important line of truth.

   When Adam was created God said, "Let us make man in our image, and let
   them have dominion." At the beginning, earth's scepter was committed
   into the hands of man (see Ps. 8:4-8). But right on the scene of his
   creation came one who disputed Adam's right to earth's sovereignty, and
   who succeeded in wresting the scepter from his hands. Satan brought to
   bear upon him a diabolical temptation: Adam succumbed, and falling, he
   forfeited his dominion over the earth. As the consequence, Satan became
   "The Prince of this world," and as such approached our Lord in the
   temptation, when he took Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and
   "sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And
   saith unto Him, All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall
   down and worship me" (Matt. 4:8, 9). But on the Cross, the Lord Jesus
   re-gained the scepter which Adam lost; and here is the key to Rev. 5.

   In the fifth chapter of the Apocalypse a remarkable scene is brought
   before us. The beloved apostle sees a book--"written within and on the
   back side, sealed with seven seals"--in the right hand of Him that sat
   on the Throne. Then he hears an angel saying, "Who is worthy to open
   the book, and to loose the seals thereof?" Next we are told, "And no
   man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open
   the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was
   found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon."
   Many have been the conjectures concerning this mysterious "book," but
   by comparing Scripture with Scripture we think there can be no doubt as
   to what is here in view. In Jer. 32:6-15 we read of a field being
   bought, and the receipt (the "evidence") of the purchase is termed a
   "book," and this book was "sealed." It is to a similar transaction that
   Rev. 5 refers. The book seen by the apostle contains the title deeds to
   this earth. These title deeds which Adam lost have been recovered by
   Christ. They have been recovered by "purchase," and the price paid was
   the precious blood of the Lamb. In Matt. 13:44 we read of a Man who
   "goeth and selleth all that He hath, and buyeth that field" and in
   verse 38 of the same chapter we are told "The field is the world."
   Hence it is that the apostle was told, "Weep not: behold, the Lion of
   the Tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book,
   and to loose the seven seals thereof" (Rev. 5:5). What is seen in
   vision in Rev. 5 becomes actual fact when the Lord Jesus returns to the
   earth. It will be at that time the "purchased possession"--the
   earth--is "redeemed" (Eph. 1:14). Hence, when He comes back, His first
   act will be to eject Satan from it, establish His Kingdom upon it, and
   exercise "dominion" over it.

   Another Scripture which throws light upon the Millennium in relation to
   Christ is 1 Peter 1:13. Here the second coming of our Lord (to the
   earth) is termed, "The Revelation of Jesus Christ." This is in contrast
   to the first advent. When He was here before, His Divine glory was
   veiled and much of His power and majesty were concealed. But when He
   comes back again His Divine glory shall be fully manifested. Instead of
   appearing as the gentle Lamb, He will come as the Lion of the Tribe of
   Judah. Instead of standing before human tribunals to be judged of men,
   He will summon all nations before Him and sit in judgment upon them.
   Instead of appearing in humiliation, weakness, and shame, He will be
   revealed in regal power and majesty. Instead of coming to be the
   Victim, He will return as the Victor, to sit upon the Throne of His
   Glory. So, then, the Millennium is the time when our Lord enters into
   the exercise of His Kingly office, when He will reign in power and
   exercise dominion over all the earth, and when His personal Glory shall
   be fully manifested. We turn now to consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

  3. The Millennium in relation to the Church.

   As we have seen in previous chapters, it is at the first stage of
   Christ's second coming that the Church is removed from earth. At the
   Redeemer's descent from Heaven, the Church, like Enoch and Elijah, is
   miraculously caught up, caught up to meet the Lord in the air and
   evermore shall it be with its glorious Head. Therefore, when the
   Saviour returns to the earth, the Church will accompany Him. This is
   clear from Col. 3:4 and Jude 14, so often quoted in these pages.

   Exactly what part the Church will play during the Millennium it is not
   easy to say. Few details are revealed. A moment's reflection will show
   why this is the case. It is in the Old Testament that the Millennium
   receives the fullest consideration, whereas the Church is the subject
   of New Testament revelation. Moreover, we must remember that the
   Millennium is the time when God's Kingdom is revealed on earth, whereas
   the Church is a Heavenly creation, and has a heavenly citizenship and
   destiny (Phil. 3:20; 1 Pet. 1:4). Nevertheless, one or two things are
   sure. The Church will be with Christ throughout the Millennium, and not
   only so, the saints will reign with Him--"And they sung a new song,
   saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals
   thereof: for Thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood
   out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made
   us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on (or "over")
   the earth(Rev. 5:9, 10). And again we read, "Blessed and holy is he
   that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath
   no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall
   reign with Him a thousand years"(Rev. 20:6). Who can picture the
   blessed accomplishment of this promise! For two thousand years the
   saints have (more or less) lived as strangers and pilgrims on the
   earth. Many of them have been maligned, ostracized, persecuted and
   martyred. They went forth unto Christ "without the camp, bearing His
   reproach" (Heb. 13:13). But now shall they be richly rewarded. They
   suffered "with Him" and now shall they be also "glorified together"
   (Rom. 8:17). And then will it be fully manifested that "the sufferings
   of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
   shall be revealed in us" (Rom. 8:18).

   In the Parable of the Pounds we have a Scripture which sets forth one
   aspect of the reward which shall be enjoyed by the faithful in that
   day. "And He (Christ) said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because
   thou has been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten
   cities" (Luke 19:17). This Scripture seems to intimate that during the
   Millennium the saints will occupy a prominent part in the government of
   the world. Yes, it is written, "Do ye not know that the saints shall
   judge the world?" (1 Cor. 6:2). Ah! how different things will then be.
   The first shall be last, and the last first. Positions shall be
   completely reversed. Today the children of God (that is, those who
   really walk as such) are despised and hated by the world, but they
   shall yet be placed in authority over the world. This is the promise of
   our Lord: And he that overcometh, and keepeth My works unto the end, to
   him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a
   rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to
   shivers: even as I received of My Father" (Rev. 2:26, 27). Yes,
   Christ's position, Christ's power, Christ's prerogatives, shall be
   shared by His people, for He and they are one.

   Again; it is during the Millennium that the unity of the Church--in
   contradistinction to the innumerable sects in Christendom which now
   divide believers--will be fully manifested, and our Lord's prayer of
   John 17:22, 23 fulfilled--"And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have
   given them; that they may be one, even as We are One: I in them, and
   Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world
   may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast
   loved Me." Not until the "Day of Christ" will the world "know" these
   things, for then it is that we shall all have come "in the unity of the
   faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
   the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph. 4:13). Yes,
   and then it is, also that Christ shall come "to be glorified in His
   saints and admired in all that believe" (2 Thess. 1:10). In that day,
   the Church will be an object of beauty, wonderment, and admiration to
   all the world. It will then be fully seen what great things the Lord
   hath done for His Church, in giving it a higher place--a place nearer
   to Himself than that which even the holy angels will occupy. We turn
   now to consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

  4. The Millennium in relation to Israel.

   "And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark,
   behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those
   pieces. In that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying,
   Unto thy seed have I given this land" (Gen. 15:17, 18). Here the two
   great periods of Israel's history was made known to Abram in figure.
   The vision of the smoking furnace and the burning lamp intimated that
   the history of Abraham's descendants was to be a checkered one. It was
   a prophecy in symbolic action; and like all prophecy was to have a
   double fulfillment. The order was first the sorrow and suffering, and
   then the glory and joy. There was first the smoking furnace of Egyptian
   bondage, and then the burning lamp which typified the brilliant reign
   of Solomon. After which there was the furnace, again, the furnace of
   the Babylonian captivity, and since Israel crucified her Messiah the
   furnace has been seven times hotter than ever before. Yet is it
   written, "For Zion's sake I will not hold My peace, for Jerusalem's
   sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as
   brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth" (Is.
   62:1).

   A remarkable statement is found in Deut. 32:8 which antedates the
   actual history of the Jews. "When the Most High divided to the nations
   their inheritance, when He separated the sons of Adam, He set the
   bounds of the people according to the number of the children of
   Israel." Israel is here seen to be present before the mind of God six
   hundred years before they had any national standing in the earth, and
   two hundred years before the birth of their father Abraham. Yet, even
   at that remote period, God assigned to the descendants of the then
   scattered sons of Adam, their position in the earth according to the
   number of that people which was not then born. Here, then, we learn
   God's purpose concerning the chosen nation--Israel is God's earthly
   center.

   In Gen. 13:14, 15, we read "And the Lord said unto Abram, after that
   Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes and look from the
   place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
   westward. For all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it, and
   to thy seed forever." And again in Gen. 15:18 we are told, "In that
   same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed
   have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river,
   the river Euphrates." The land of Palestine has been given
   unconditionally to Abraham and his descendants, "For the gifts and
   calling of God are without repentance" (Rom. 11:29). But these Divine
   promises have never received anything more than a partial fulfillment.
   The patriarchs themselves were but sojourners in a strange country, so
   much so, they needed to purchase a burying ground in it for their dead.
   It is true that in the days of Joshua, Israel entered into possession
   of the Promised Land, but it is to be particularly noted that they
   entered Canaan under the Covenant of Law (see Deut. 27:1-3, 8-10; 28:1
   etc.), and hence their continued tenure of it was conditioned upon
   their obedience to Jehovah. But, as is well know, they failed to walk
   in the Divine statutes, and turned aside after false gods. And long did
   Jehovah bear with their waywardness. Prophet after prophet was sent
   unto them, calling them to forsake their sins and return unto the Lord
   and He would abundantly pardon. But in vain. Ultimately the point was
   reached when God's patience became exhausted, and in judgment upon them
   He sent them into captivity, from whence nothing more than a remnant
   has ever returned to their own land. It was to the descendants of this
   remnant that the Lord Jesus came. To the "lost sheep of the house of
   Israel" He was sent (Matt. 10:5-7; 15:24). But He received no better
   treatment at their hands than did the prophets who were before Him--"He
   came unto His own and His own received Him not." He was despised and
   rejected of men, and Israel disowned their King and put Him to a
   shameful death. While their Messiah was hanging upon the Cross, "All
   the people said, His blood be on us, and on our children" (Matt.
   27:25), and God took them at their word! A few years later Jerusalem
   was besieged, captured and destroyed by the armies of Titus; hundreds
   of thousands of Jews were slain, and the remainder of them carried away
   into captivity. Since that time they have been a homeless nation, and
   wanderers on the face of the earth. Literally has the prophecy of Hosea
   been fulfilled, "For the children of Israel shall abide many days
   without a king" (Hosea 3:4). And yet, in spite of all, they have
   preserved their national individuality, and have never been absorbed by
   the other nations.

   Now, it is evident that the nation of Israel has been preserved for a
   purpose, and what that purpose is, God's Word makes known. A marvelous
   future yet awaits these descendants of Abraham. Jerusalem is not
   trodden down of the Gentiles, but it is only to continue thus "Until
   the Times of the Gentiles be fulfilled" (Luke 21:24). The tabernacle of
   David, now fallen down, is to be restored (Acts 15:16), and the one who
   has been for so long the sport of the nations shall yet become its
   "head" (Deut. 28:13).

   The restoration of Israel occupies a most prominent place in the
   Scriptures of truth and three things should be particularly noted in
   connection therewith. First, the restoration of Israel cannot take
   place until after the Church has been removed from the earth. Second,
   the restoration of the entire nation will be a gradual one. Third,
   restored Israel will occupy a much more exalted and glorious position
   than any it has held in the past, not excepting the reign of Solomon.
   The first of these three statements is based upon Acts 15:14-17 where
   we are expressly told that it is not until "after" God has taken out of
   the Gentiles a people for His name that He will return and build again
   the tabernacle of David. The second and third statements, above, will
   now be considered at more length.

   In Zech. 12:9, 10 we are told, "And I will pour upon the House of
   David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and
   of supplications: and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced,
   and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourneth for his only son and
   shall be in bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his
   firstborn." Here is the starting-point of Israel's moral restoration,
   namely, the repentance of Judah. Be it noted that this prophecy
   contemplates the House of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem only,
   for it is not until a later date that God deals with the Ten Tribes.
   With the above Scripture should be linked 2 Cor. 3:15, 16--"But even
   unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.
   Nevertheless when it (Israel) shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
   taken away." One of the first consequences of Judah's turning unto the
   Lord in repentance will be the removal of the veil now upon their
   heart.

   The restoration of the Ten Tribes is brought before us in Ezek. 34--the
   whole chapter should be read--"For thus saith the Lord God; behold, I,
   even I, will both search My sheep, and seek them out. As a shepherd
   seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are
   scattered; so will I seek out My sheep, and will deliver them out of
   all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
   And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the
   countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon
   the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places
   of the country. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high
   mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good
   fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of
   Israel. I will feed My flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
   the Lord God" (vss. 11-15). The Ten Tribes restored to Palestine shall
   be united to the House of Judah and the two Houses become one
   again--"Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the Children of
   Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather
   them on every side and bring them into their own land: And I will make
   them a nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one King
   shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations,
   neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
   Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor
   with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but
   I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have
   sinned, and will cleanse them: so they shall be My people, and I will
   be their God. And David My Servant shall be King over them; and they
   all shall have one Shepherd; they shall also walk in My judgments, and
   observe My statutes, and do them. And they shall dwell in the land
   which I have given unto Jacob My Servant, wherein your fathers have
   dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and
   their children's children for ever: and My Servant David shall be their
   Prince for ever. Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them: it
   shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and
   will multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them for
   evermore. My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their
   God, and they shall be My people. And the heathen shall know that I the
   Lord do sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in the midst of
   them for evermore" (Ezek. 37:21-28).

   With the restored and re-united twelve tribes God will make a new
   covenant--"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a
   new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not
   according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day
   that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
   which My covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith
   the Lord: But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the
   house of Israel; after those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in
   their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their
   God, and they shall be My people. And they shall teach no more every
   man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for
   they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of
   them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
   remember their sin no more" (Jer. 31:31-45; cf. 32:37-40; Is. 59:20,
   21).

   Early in the Millennium Jerusalem will be rebuilt: "Thus saith the
   Lord; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and
   have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be builded upon
   her own little hill, and the palace shall remain after the manner
   thereof" (Jer. 30:18, cf. 31:38-40). Furthermore, the Temple itself
   will be re-built, built under the immediate supervision of the Lord
   Himself--"Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, behold the man whose
   name is The BRANCH; and He shall grow up out of His place, and He shall
   build the Temple of the Lord: Even He shall build the Temple of the
   Lord; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon His
   throne; and He shall be a priest upon His throne: and the counsel of
   peace shall be between them both** and they that are far off shall come
   and build in the Temple of the Lord, and ye shall know that the Lord of
   hosts hath sent Me unto you" (Zech. 6:12-15). This Temple, which is
   fully described in Ezekiel 40 and 41, will be an imposing structure of
   vast dimensions, upwards of a mile in extent. The Shekinah Glory shall
   enter it and from it radiate the whole earth--"And, behold, the Glory
   of the God of Israel (i.e., the Shekinah Glory, see 11:23), came from
   the way of the east: and His voice was like a noise of many waters: and
   the earth shined with His glory" (Ezek. 43:2). The Old Testament ritual
   (with a few minor modifications) will be employed in this re-built
   Temple--see Ezek. 46 etc.--and as of old the sacrifices and feasts were
   anticipative, so those offered up and celebrated in the Millennium will
   be commemorative.

   During the Millennium the land of Palestine will be apportioned equally
   among the Twelve Tribes--see Ezek. 47 and 48--and upon thrones shall
   sit the twelve apostles judging the twelve tribes of Israel--"And Jesus
   said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed Me;
   in The Regeneration (i.e., the Millennium) when the Son of Man shall
   sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,
   judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (Matt. 19:28). Apparently, it was
   to this Isaiah referred to when he wrote--"Behold, a King shall reign
   in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment" (Is. 32:1).

   Many are the passages which describe Israel's millennial glory and
   blessedness. The last six chapters of Isaiah are occupied more or less
   with this theme, and from them we quote a few portions. After speaking
   of the Redeemer's return to Zion (Is. 59:20, 21), the prophet
   cries--"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord
   is risen upon thee" (Is. 60:1). The prophet continues--"And the
   Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of they
   rising.** Surely the isles shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish
   first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with
   them, unto the name of the Lord thy God, and the Holy One of Israel,
   because He hath glorified thee. And the sons of strangers shall build
   up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in My wrath
   I smote thee, but in My favor have I had mercy on thee. Therefore thy
   gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night;
   that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the Gentiles, and that their
   kings may be brought. For the nation and kingdom that will not serve
   thee shall perish: yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.** The
   sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and
   all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of
   thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the Lord, The Zion of
   the Holy One of Israel. Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so
   that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency,
   a joy of many generations.** Thy sun shall no more go down; neither
   shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting
   light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Thy people also
   shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land forever, the branch
   of My planting, the work of My hands, that I may be glorified" (Is.
   60:3, 9-12, 14, 15, 20, 21). The Lord shall "appoint unto them that
   mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
   mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they
   might be called Trees of Righteousness, The planting of the Lord, that
   He might be glorified. And they shall build the old wastes, they shall
   raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste
   cities, the desolations of many generations. And strangers shall stand
   and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen
   and your vinedressers. But ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord:
   men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of
   the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves" (61:3-6).
   And again; "And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings
   thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of
   the Lord shall name. Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of
   the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. Thou shalt no more
   be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate:
   but thou shalt be called Hephzibah (My delight is in her), and thy land
   Beulah (Married): for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall
   be married" (62:2-4).

   Not only will Israel enjoy glorious blessings themselves, but, in the
   Millennium, they shall be a blessing to "all families of the earth"
   (Gen. 12:3). Then will be fulfilled that word, "He shall cause them
   that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill
   the face of the world with fruit" (Is. 27:6). And further we are told,
   "And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew
   from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass" (Micah 5:7).

   We turn now to consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

  5. The Millennium in relation to the World.

   The Millennium will be the time, when, instead of Satan being the
   world's "Prince," the Christ of God shall be its King. The form of His
   government will be theocratic not democratic--"And the Lord shall be
   King over all the earth" (Zech. 14:9). The scope or range of His
   government will be world-wide. All nations will be subject to His rule,
   and the uttermost parts of the earth shall be possessed by Him. "He
   shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends
   of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall be before Him;
   and His enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish and of the
   isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Sheba shall offer
   gifts. Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him: all nations shall
   serve Him" (Psalms 72:8-11). This is what is in view in Rev.
   11:15--"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
   heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of
   our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever."

   Perhaps at this point it would be well if we endeavored to meet a
   difficulty which many inquirers experience in connection with the
   Millennium. It may be stated thus. If the saints are all caught up to
   meet the Lord at His descent into the air, and the wicked are all
   destroyed during the Tribulation period, who will be left to inhabit
   the earth during the Kingdom age? The answer is simple. It is a mistake
   to suppose that all who are left behind at the Rapture will be
   subsequently destroyed by God's judgments. It is true that "the slain
   of the Lord will be many," yet the earth will not be entirely
   depopulated. This is evident from Matt. 25:31. It is also true that
   "all" who now believe not the truth will "perish" during the Day of
   God's vengeance--2 Thess. 2, yet many of the children of these
   unbelievers will be spared. Not all of those who will be gathered
   together for the battle of that great day of God Almighty will be
   slain, as is clear from Is. 66:19, where we read of "those that
   escape." The slaughter at Armageddon will be inconceivably dreadful,
   for from that battlefield will flow a river of blood two hundred miles
   in length and several feet in depth, yet we know from Zech. 14:16 that
   a "remnant" will be spared--"And it shall come to pass, that every one
   that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem, shall
   even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts."
   Finally; there will be a Jewish remnant miraculously preserved by God
   (Rev. 12) and these together with their resurrected brethren who were
   slain by the Anti-christ (Rev. 20:4) will form the nucleus from which
   will spring the Millennial Israel.

   The seat of Christ's government will be Jerusalem, the royal city, "And
   many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain
   of the Lord, to the House of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of
   His ways, and we will walk in His paths, for out of Zion shall go forth
   the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" (Is. 2:3).

   The character of Messiah's government is brought before us in Is.
   11:3-5, "And He shall not judge after the sight of His eyes, neither
   reprove after the hearing of His ears: but with righteousness shall he
   judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and
   He shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath
   of His lips shall He slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the
   girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins." During
   the Kingdom age--in contradistinction to the present dispensation of
   Grace wherein God endures with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath
   fitted to destruction--wickedness shall be promptly dealt with and evil
   doers will meet with swift judgment: "Whoso privily slandereth his
   neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath a high look and a proud
   heart will not I suffer. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the
   land, that they may dwell with Me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he
   shall serve Me. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within My house:
   he that telleth lies shall not tarry in My sight. I will early destroy
   all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked-doers from
   the city of the Lord" (Ps. 101:5-8).

   We turn now to some of the results of Christ's government. During the
   Millennium our Lord will rule as "The Prince of Peace." For the first
   time since the flood, the earth will be completely delivered from the
   horrors of war. Then it will be seen that "He maketh wars to cease unto
   the ends of the earth" (Ps. 46:9). The Kingdom age will be a time of
   universal peace--"And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
   and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword
   against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore" (Is. 2:4).

   During the Millennium there shall also be universal blessing. An
   exceedingly sublime picture of the conditions that will then obtain is
   to be found in Is. 35:5-10, "Then the eyes of the blind shall be
   opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the
   lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the
   wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the
   parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land "springs of
   water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass
   with reeds and rushes. And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it
   shall be called the way of holiness: the unclean shall not pass over
   it; but it shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor any
   ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there. And
   the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and
   everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness,
   and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."

   At the beginning of the Millennium there shall be a universal worship
   of Christ--"And it shall come to pass that everyone that is left of all
   the nations which came against Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to
   year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts" (Zech. 14:16).

   What a glorious time the Millennium will be for our poor sin-cursed
   earth! Universal righteousness, universal peace, universal blessing,
   and universal worship! Surely we have reason to pray "Thy kingdom
   come." And now,

  6. The Millennium in relation to Creation.

   The blessings which will be brought to the world upon the establishment
   of the Messianic Kingdom will not be confined to the human family but
   will be extended to all creation.

   As we have shown in earlier chapters, the Curse which was pronounced by
   God upon the ground in the day of Adam's fall, and which resulted in a
   creation that has groaned and travailed ever since, is yet to be
   revoked. Creation is not to remain in bondage for ever. God has set a
   hope before it, a hope, which like ours, centers in the personal return
   of Christ. "For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the
   revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to vanity,
   not of its own will, but by reason of Him who subjected it in hope;
   that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
   corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God" (Rom.
   8:19-21 R.V.). A passage closely connected with the one just quoted is
   found in the ninety-sixth Psalm--"Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
   earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof. Let the
   field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of
   the wood rejoice. Before the Lord: for He cometh, for He cometh to
   judge the earth: He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
   people with His truth" (vss. 11-13). These verses picture the joy of
   all Nature consequent upon the advent of its Creator to the earth.

   One striking effect of Creation's deliverance from its present bondage
   is described in Is. 30:26--"Moreover the light of the moon shall be (in
   the Millennium) as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall
   be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord
   bindeth up the breach of His people, and healeth the stroke of their
   wound." An illustration of the Curse being removed from the "ground" is
   found in Is. 35:1. When the Times of Refreshing shall come from the
   presence of the Lord then shall "the desert rejoice and blossom as the
   rose." This is further amplified in Isaiah 41:17-20--"When the poor and
   needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for
   thirst I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake
   them. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of
   the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry
   land springs of water. I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the
   shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the
   desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together: That they
   may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand
   of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created
   it."

   Not the least of the beneficent changes introduced during the
   Millennium will be the restoration of the animal kingdom to its Edenic
   state. The present ferocity of the wild beast is abnormal and due to
   the fall of man. It is very clear from Genesis 2 that, originally, man
   had full dominion over all the animal kingdom, but this was forfeited
   when he rebelled against his Maker. In the kingdom age--the Times of
   the Restitution of all things spoken of by the prophets--the fierce
   nature of the beasts will be subdued, for in that day, "The wolf also
   shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
   and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little
   child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young
   ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw as the ox.
   And the sucking child shall play on the hole of an asp, and the weaned
   child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt
   nor destroy in all My holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the
   knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea" (Is. 11:6-9).

   By comparing Scripture with Scripture it would appear that, during the
   Millennium, there will be no earthquakes, no tornadoes, no storms at
   sea, but all Nature will be at rest and share in the general blessing
   which the personal presence of Christ shall bring. And yet, there will
   be droughts and plagues upon the rebellious and disobedient (see Zech.
   14:18, 19), which leads us to consider,
     __________________________________________________________________

  7. The Millennium in relation to Sin.

   In spite of the fact that Satan will have been removed from the earth,
   and that Christ reigns in person over it, yet conditions here will not
   be perfect even in the Millennium.

   Unregenerate human nature will remain unchanged. Sin will still be
   present, though much of its outward manifestation will be restrained.
   Discontent and wickedness will not be eradicated from the hearts of
   men, but will be kept beneath the surface by means of the Iron Rod.
   Multitudes will yield to Christ nothing but a "feigned obedience" (Ps.
   18:44, margin). This "feigned obedience" will be the product of power
   not grace; it will be the fruit of fear not love. In Psalm 72, which
   gives a graphic picture of millennial conditions, we read, "They that
   dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him; and His enemies shall
   lick the dust" (vs. 9). Again, we are told in Psalm 110:2 that the Lord
   shall rule in the midst of "enemies." In Psalm 149, wherein the
   children of Zion are bidden to "be joyful in their King," we are told
   that His saints shall "execute vengeance upon the heathen, and
   punishments upon the people; To bind their kings with chains, and their
   nobles with fetters of iron; To execute upon them the judgment written:
   this honor have all His saints. Praise ye the Lord" (vss. 7-9). In
   Micah 5, where we have another description of the judgments which the
   remnant of Jacob will execute upon the Gentiles, we are told, "And the
   remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people, as a lion among
   the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep:
   who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and
   none can deliver. Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries,
   and all thine enemies shall be cut off" (vss. 8-10). These verses do
   not conflict with those Scriptures which speak of great blessings,
   spiritual as well as temporal, coming upon the Gentiles during the
   Millennium, but warn us that the Kingdom age is not the Perfect State,
   and that while most if not all will worship outwardly, yet at heart
   many are still the enemies of the Lord.

   At the close of the Millennium Satan will be temporarily released from
   his prison in order to test humanity: "And when the thousand years are
   expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to
   deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog
   and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as
   the sand of the sea. And they went upon the breadth of the earth, and
   compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city" (Rev.
   20:7-9). Thus will be fully and finally demonstrated the incurable evil
   of the human heart. Even a thousand years of millennial blessedness,
   with Satan away from the earth, will not effect any change in man. Let
   Satan be loosed and allowed to go forth once more and deceive the
   nations, and it shall be seen that the carnal mind is still enmity
   against God, and prefers a Murderer to the Lord Jesus. Nothing avails
   short of a new creation. Miracles, a beneficent environment, temporal
   blessings--nothing without, can alter fallen and depraved human nature.
   "Except a man be born of water (the Word) and of the Spirit he cannot
   enter the kingdom of God" (John 3:5).

   The final revolt of man under the leadership of the Devil will meet
   with swift judgment--"And fire came down from God out of heaven and
   devoured them" (Rev. 20:9). What follows is told us in few words. Satan
   himself is cast into the Lake of Fire where the Beast and the False
   Prophet are, and all of the unsaved dead from Cain onwards will be
   raised from their graves, to stand before the great white Throne and be
   judged according to their works. The purpose of this judgment is to
   determine their respective sentences, for there will be degrees of
   punishment among the lost, as there will be degrees of glory among the
   redeemed. "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was
   cast into the Lake of Fire" (Rev. 20:15). Oh, my reader, is your name
   written in the book of life? If it is not, there is nothing before you
   but a hopeless and endless eternity of suffering, of suffering so
   fearful that no human pen or tongue can adequately depict it.

   "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into
   the Lake of Fire." Unsaved reader, what an awful prospect is thing! The
   day of reckoning fast hastens on. God is yet going to call you to
   account and take full satisfaction to His justice. Long have you defied
   Him, but soon He will put forth His power and deal with you in
   judgment. What He has threatened that will He most surely perform. The
   Lake of Fire! Eternal suffering! Tormented day and night for ever and
   ever! Such a portion will be unendurable, and yet it will have to be a
   endured by every Christ-rejector, and endured for ever and ever. "Can
   thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I
   shall deal with thee? I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it" (Ezek.
   22:14).

   Following the great white Throne judgment and the casting of the host
   into the Lake of Fire, Christ will deliver up the kingdom to God, even
   the Father, "when He shall have put down all rule, and all authority,
   and power. For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His
   feet. And when all things be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also
   Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may
   be all in all" (1 Cor. 15:24, 25, 28; and see further Rev. 21:1-5).

                                   Conclusion

   As we take up our pen to write these closing paragraphs, we do so
   conscious that we have merely skimmed, here and there, the surface of a
   vast ocean of truth. Though upwards of five hundred Scriptures have
   been referred to in these pages, yet, hundreds more could have been
   cited in support of the positions which we have advanced. An exhaustive
   classification and examination of all the passages which are connected,
   directly or indirectly, with the subject of the Redeemer's Return,
   would necessitate many volumes rather than one. Our opponents greatly
   err who suppose that pre-millennialism rests upon a few doubtful and
   obscure passages. The texts upon which we rely are neither few nor
   ambiguous, and their testimony is neither scanty nor uncertain. No
   other doctrine of Scripture can produce a larger, more distinct, and
   more vigorous testimony in its favor. The Coming and Kingdom of the
   Lord Jesus Christ is a theme which pervades the Bible from Genesis to
   Revelation. It is the central burden of prophecy. It is the grand
   solution to the mystery of Divine Providence. It is the one great hope
   of the Church, of Israel, and of creation.

   The personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ to set up His Kingdom on
   the earth and reign over it in power and glory is no novelty of a
   feverish age, no hasty conjecture caught up at random without
   consideration and unsupported by reliable evidence. It is no fable of
   romance, but sober, Scriptural reality, though far beyond what fancy
   ever painted. It is no creation of a disordered mind, but the Golden
   Milestone of Scripture to which all lines of prophecy are rapidly
   converging. It is no pet theory of certain religious fanatics, but the
   approaching Climax of all history. It is no mere dream of idealists,
   but the promised consummation and glorious issue of all the confusion
   and change, the sin and sorrow, the disease and death which have
   desolated the earth for six thousand years. It is the divinely ordained
   Remedy for those deep and manifold evils under which humanity now
   groans and which men are so earnestly, yet vainly, seeking to cure.

   Had we followed the inclinations of our own heart, we should have
   devoted a chapter to the history of Millennarianism. We might have
   quoted from the early Church "fathers" and shown that during the first
   three centuries of the Christian era it prevailed universally, its only
   opponents being the Gnostics. We might have referred to the writings of
   the Reformers, and shown how they one and all looked for the imminent
   coming of Christ. We might have inserted citations from modern authors
   whose piety and scholarship are unquestioned. But we had no desire to
   buttress our position by human authority even of the most ancient and
   honorable kind. Let not our faith stand in the wisdom of men, but in
   the power of God. Unless our theses can be unequivocally maintained
   from Holy Scripture, it were vain to call in human witnesses however
   numerous or however venerable.

   The saddest thing of all in connection with our subject is that
   Christian theologians have divided into opposite camps. And yet it need
   not surprise us that the Second Coming of Christ is a controverted
   doctrine--what doctrine of Scripture is not? Nevertheless, it is the
   bounden duty of every lover of the Lord's appearing to pray earnestly
   that it may please God to lead out a greater number of His children
   into the light, and that there may be a more harmonious and united
   testimony borne to this most important of all truths. We fervently
   trust that one result of our humble labors will be that many who read
   these pages will go forth crying "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye
   out to meet Him." That the masses will give neither heed nor credit to
   the alarm is only to be expected. When Lot warned his sons-in-law of
   the impending doom of Sodom "he seemed as one that mocked"(Gen. 19:14).
   When Israel's prophets clamored for those who would speak unto them
   "smooth things" (Is. 30:10). And when our Saviour announced the
   destruction of Jerusalem His words fell upon ears which scepticism had
   closed. But, notwithstanding, our duty is plain. Results belong unto
   God; our business is to sound the alarm and "to exhort one another: and
   so much the more, as we see the Day approaching" (Heb. 10:25).

   Brethren, the end of the Age is upon us. All over the world, reflecting
   minds are discerning the fact that we are on the very eve of another of
   those far-reaching crises which make the history of our race. Their
   sense of justice tells them that the unbridled lust, the increasing
   oppression, the unparalleled bloodshed, have defied Heaven long enough
   and that the Judge of all the earth must soon rise in His wrath to make
   "a short work" (Rom. 9:28) of it all. Those who look out on present
   conditions are forced to conclude that the consummation of this
   dispensation is at hand. But it is only they who give diligent heed to
   the study of the prophetic Word that have "understanding of the times"
   (1 Chron. 12:32). Let the believer ask, Watchman what of the night: and
   the infallible answer is, "The night cometh"! And it never appeared so
   nigh. Everywhere the shadows are gathering, gathering deeper and
   broader, lengthening out and falling with ominous gloom all over the
   earth. The world's night is at hand.

   The sands in the hour glass of this Day of Salvation have almost run
   out. The Signs of the Times demonstrate it. "But," it may be asked,
   "Have not other ages, as well as the present, been crowded with signs
   of distress?" Undoubtedly. We read, "The thing that hath been, it is
   that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be
   done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there anything
   whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already of old
   time" (Ecc. 1:9, 10)! Many of the Signs which now appear in the sky
   have been visible to former generations, yet, today, they shine out
   more clearly and more prominently than ever before. "But," it may be
   objected, "Have there not always been pessimists who interpreted
   gloomily the events of their day? Have not others, again and again,
   written in similar strain, only to be shamed and discredited?" Be it
   so. But were they not wise men who took the earliest alarm, even though
   their fears were not immediately realized! They read evil in the Signs
   of their Times and gave utterance to their convictions so that their
   fellow-men might be aroused; and surely that was not folly. They unduly
   magnified the evil, and erred in their calculations, yet it cannot be
   denied that their warning was beneficial in its results even though it
   was premature. But today, the Signs are so plain they cannot be
   mis-read, though the foolish may close their eyes and refuse to examine
   them. What these Signs are we have shown at length in Chapter Six and
   if the evidence there furnished has not convinced the reader that the
   Lord is at hand, then there is little hope that any further arguments
   drawn from Scripture will do so. Notwithstanding, we digress for a
   moment in order to call attention to one other Sign entirely different
   from those previously mentioned. In Nahum 2:3, 4 we read, "The chariots
   shall be with flaming torches in the day of His preparation, and the
   fir trees shall be terribly shaken. The chariots shall rage in the
   streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways: they
   shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings." What an
   accurate description of the conditions which now prevail in every city
   and along every public high-way throughout the land! The enormous
   increase in the number of automobiles, so that such a congestion of
   street traffic is produced it may literally be said "They jostle one
   against another in the broad ways;" their flaming torches;" and their
   high rate of speed so that they "run like the lightnings," are here
   accurately depicted. What is to be particularly noted is that this
   phenomenon is peculiar to this present generation, and that we are
   expressly told it is to be a characteristic of "The Day of His
   Preparation."

   "But," it may be asked again, "Why is it that so few of our religious
   leaders and teachers are heralding the approach of Christ?" The answer
   is, Because many of them are blind themselves--"blind leaders of the
   blind." As the Word declares, they are "ever learning and never able to
   come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Tim. 3:7). It is greatly to be
   feared that the majority of our preachers are following the traditions
   of the elders rather than studying the Scriptures for themselves. Their
   prophetical views were formed under Seminary interpretations of
   eschatology and the Seminaries, in turn, are committed to some system
   of theology, a system formulated in most cases by men who lived
   centuries ago. While the Church is deeply indebted, under God, to such
   men as Luther and Calvin, Wesley and Whitefield, yet, it must be borne
   in mind that they lived in an age when Prophecy was almost entirely
   neglected. It was not until last century that the Holy Spirit stirred
   up the people of God to the deep importance of studying prophetic and
   dispensational truth: Previous to the nineteenth century all teaching
   which had reference to the Second Coming of Christ was, with very rare
   exceptions, merely traditional, that is to say, it was nothing more
   than what had been handed down from one generation to another, it was
   merely the reciting of the dreams of others who had gone before. We say
   "the dreams," for after the Hope of the Redeemer's Return was
   lost--while the Bridegroom tarried--all the virgins slumbered and
   slept, and while they slept they dreamed, and wild and weird were their
   dreams. They dreamt that the Church was to conquer the Devil and that
   the Gospel would win the world to Christ. This dream captivated the
   minds of theologians of every shade of religious belief. Each
   succeeding generation recounted this dream in still more glowing
   language, until the climax was reached some four years ago. How much we
   heard of religious progress, of the march of civilization, and of the
   "good time" that was coming! The horrible arts of war were to be
   nothing more than humbling memories of the past. The labors of our
   politicians and the activities of the Church would soon produce an era
   wherein the universal rights of mankind were freely recognized, when
   tyranny and injustice would be overthrown, and when culture and virtue
   would reign supreme. Christian and secular philanthropists
   congratulated each other in view of the Golden Age which their joint
   efforts were hastening on. But the happenings of the last three years
   have rudely dissipated this dream. The dreadful War has shown that much
   which went under the name of civilization was nothing but veneered
   barbarism. The battle fields of Europe bear witness to the fact that
   the optimistic and jubilant spirit which possessed our church leaders a
   few years ago was nothing more than Laodicean self-complacency, saying
   "I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing," when
   in reality Christendom was "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
   blind, and naked" (Rev. 3:17). The blood-soaked earth of today exposes
   the utter vanity of the delusive hope cherished by the
   post-millenarians and gives fulfillment to God's Word which declares
   "For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
   cometh upon them" (1 Thess. 5:3).

   Unless men had been strangely blinded, the analogy of the past ought to
   have corrected the blind optimism of which we have just spoken. Every
   previous dispensation has ended in human failure and Divine judgment!
   The Edenic dispensation saw the fall of man and his expulsion from the
   garden of Eden. At the close of the Noahic dispensation "God looked
   upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had
   corrupted his way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, The end of
   all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence
   through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth" (Gen.
   6:12, 13). The Patriarchal dispensation, when the sword of the
   magistrate was committed into the hands of man, witnessed the revolt
   and overthrow of the Tower of Babel and the destruction of Sodom and
   Gomorrah by fire from heaven. The Abrahamic dispensation ended with the
   people of God in the iron furnace of Egypt and with the overthrow of
   Pharaoh and his hosts at the Red Sea. The dispensation of the
   Wilderness wanderings terminated with the disobedience and death of
   Moses. The dispensation of the Judges closed with "every man doing that
   which was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25). The dispensation of
   the kings ended with God selling His apostate people into the hands of
   Nebuchadnezzar. The dispensation of the Diving Incarnation closed with
   the crucifixion of the Lord of Glory. Why then should this dispensation
   prove an exception to the general rule? Why is it that men are so loath
   to acknowledge that under man's pilotage everything drifts to
   shipwreck? Why, except for the pride of the human heart! According to
   the inspired declarations of Holy Writ, this dispensation, so far from
   closing like a brilliant sunset in a sky from which every cloud shall
   have passed away, will expire in a storm-burst of Divine fury, in which
   the brightest hopes of the flesh will perish like cobwebs in a flame.

   Unspeakably sad have been, and still are, the pernicious effects of the
   post-millennial teaching. Instead of listening to the voice of Divine
   truth many of the profest followers of the Lamb have heeded the siren
   voices of the earth which have drawn them into entangling alliances
   with the world, deceiving them as to their prospects here and
   persuading them to substitute carnal policy for spiritual energy and
   time-serving expendiencies for self-denying faith. O that the children
   of God would hold themselves aloof from the world's plans of social
   amelioration and political aggrandisement, and take up their cross and
   follow their despised and rejected Lord, remembering that "the
   friendship of the world is enmity with God" (Jas. 4:4). Christ has not
   left His Church here to "make the world a better world for the natural
   man to live in, nor to make the natural man a better man to live in the
   world" (Haldeman). No; Christ has left His Church here to preach a
   Gospel which shall result in the formation of a new man, a "perfect
   man" made meet to live in the world to come. So far as this world is
   concerned, nothing awaits it but Divine judgment. Men may busy
   themselves with their own plans and think to evolve a lasting good and
   peace out of the present confusion and strife, but their hope of
   setting the world right is built upon the sand. Yet, as we have seen
   there will shortly be manifested a pseudo Prince of Peace who will
   inaugurate a false millennium and thus deceive the whole world. This
   Impostor will gain the confidence of and obtain dominion over all
   Christendom. History records how in a few short years a young
   lieutenant rose out of comparative obscurity and had Europe at his
   feet, and in Napoleon Bonaparte we have a foreshadowing of what is yet
   going to be when God's time is ripe.

   "But ye, brethren are not in darkness, that that day should overtake
   you as a thief" (1 Thess. 5:4). No; the things which are hidden from
   the wise and prudent are revealed to babes in Christ. As the humble
   believer marks with what readiness educated people accept the most
   absurd crudities offered to them in the name of religion; as he
   observes on every side, thrones and republics creaking and crumbling;
   as he gazes upon immorality which has come in like a flood that is ever
   swelling and widening in its course; as he beholds the increasing
   numbers of those who have a form of godliness but deny its power; as he
   looks in vain for any deep sense of sin, for courageous faith, for an
   unworldly walk, in the majority of those who bear the name of Christ;
   as he takes knowledge of the despised Jew coming into remembrance, and
   the nations of the earth taking more and more notice of this strange
   people; as he hears men of the world, who pay no heed to the Word of
   God, acknowledging that present conditions cannot continue much longer,
   and predicting that a momentous crisis is at hand; and, as he is
   painfully conscious that there is much to show that the Holy Spirit has
   already begun to retire from the earth,--he lifts up his head, knowing
   that his redemption is nigh at hand, yea, that the Redeemer Himself is
   at the door.

   At the door! What a prospect! To look at the present frailty,
   suffering, and groaning of our vile bodies, and then to anticipate the
   moment when they shall be fashioned like unto Christ's glorious body;
   to read the histories and biographies of the apostles, of the early
   Christian martyrs, of the spiritual giants of the Reformation, of the
   choicest saints of the ages, and then to anticipate the time when we
   shall meet them, converse with them, and gather together around our
   blessed Lord; to anticipate that glad hour when everlasting joy shall
   be upon our heads and when sorrow and sighing shall flee away; when the
   joy of meeting shall be spoiled by no fear of separation, and the
   beauty of holiness shall be defiled by no stain of sin--this is a hope
   which may well endure all trials and stay the heart in these days of
   tragedy and anguish. Amidst the increasing darkness and gathering
   storms of these last days, we do not stand bewildered and dejected.
   But, with the blessed promise "Surely, I come quickly" ringing in our
   ears, love responds, "Come out of Thy royal chambers, O Prince of all
   the kings of the earth; put on the robes of Thy imperial majesty; reach
   forth Thy hand and grasp the scepter of universal sovereignty, for the
   voice of Thy Church calls for Thee, and all creation sighs to be
   renewed."


   "The dawn of day is breaking,

   Behold! it streaks the sky,

   And hearts for Him are waking,

   Who soon shall fill each eye;

   Soon! Soon! in brightness beaming,

   "The day-star" shall appear,

   With glory round Him streaming,

   His joyful shout we'll hear.

   Our eyes are looking onward,

   To see the One we love;

   Our feet are pressing forward,

   To tread those courts above;

   Our hearts do leap with pleasure,

   As nearer comes the day

   When love, beyond all measure,

   Shall beckon us away.

   There "face to face" beholding

   The One who came to die,

   His glory all unfolding

   Before each raptured eye,

   With nothing there to hinder

   The hearts deep full employ,

   But all to call forth wonder,

   And ceaseless bursts of joy.

   There on His bosom resting,

   Oh! deep and full repose,

   No more a time of testing--

   No more to meet our foes;

   But there, in brightest glory,

   To gaze upon His face,

   And ever tell that story--

   "The glory of His grace."

   2. "All the world" wonders after the first Beast, Rev. 13:3. Compare 2
   Thess. 2:11, 12--"And for this cause God shall send them strong
   delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be
   damned" etc.

   3. The first Beast is "worshipped"Rev. 13:4. Compare 2 Thess. 2:4--"he
   as God sitteth in the temple of God."

   4. The first Beast has a mouth "speaking great things" Rev. 13:5.
   Compare 2 Thess. 2:4--"who** exalteth himelf above all that is called
   God."

   5. The first Beast makes war upon the saints Rev. 13:7. Compare 2 Thess
   2:4--"Who opposeth **all that is called God," that is, he will seek to
   exterminate and obliterate everything on earth which bears God's name.

   From these five points of analogy it seems clear that the first Beast
   of Rev. 13 and the Man of Sin of 2 Thess. 2 are one and the same
   person.

   In the fifth place, that the second "Beast" is not"the Man of Sin"
   appears from the fact that the second Beast causeth the earth to
   worship the first Beast (Rev. 13:12), whereas the Man of Sin "exalteth
   himself"(2 Thess. 2:4), and compare Dan. 11:36--"And he exalteth
   himself."

   Again,; it has been generally recognized by prophetic students that our
   Lord referred to the Anti-christ when He said, "I am come in My
   Father's name, and ye receive Me not: if another shall come in his own
   name, him ye wlll receive" (John 5:43). If the one here mentioned as
   coming "in his own name" is the Anti-christ then it is certain that the
   second Beast of Rev. 13 cannot be the Anti-christ for he does not come
   "in his own name." On the contrary, the second Beast comes in the name
   of the first Beast as is clear from Rev. 13:12-15. Just as the Holy
   Spirit--the third person in the Holy Trinity--speaks "not of Himself"
   (John 16:13) but is here to glorify Christ, so the second Beast--the
   third person in the Evil Trinity--seeks to glorify the first Beast, the
   Anti-christ.

   If it should be objected that the second Beast is represented as
   working miracles (Rev. 13:13, 14) and that as the Man of Sin is also
   said to come "after the working of Satan with all power and signs and
   lying wonders" (2 Thess. 2:9) therefore the second Beast must be the
   Anti-christ, the answer is, This by no means follows. The power to work
   miracles is common to each person in the Trinity of Evil. Just as God
   the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, each perform
   miracles, so does the Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet. Three
   things are said in connection with the second Beast which correspond
   closely with the work of the Holy Spirit. First, "he maketh fire come
   down from heaven" (Rev. 13:13), compare Acts 2:1-4. Second, "he had
   power to give life unto the image of the Beast" (Rev. 13:15), compare
   John 3:6--"born of the Spirit." Third, "he causeth all, both small and
   great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right
   hand, or in their foreheads" (Rev. 13:16), compare Eph. 4:30--"Grieve
   not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
   redemption.

   Finally; the second Beast is clearly subordinate to the first Beast.
   But would the Jews receive as their Messiah and King one who was
   himself the vassal of a Roman? Was not this the very reason why the
   Jews of old rejected the Lord Jesus, i.e., Because He was subject to
   Caesar and because He refused to deliver the Jews from the Romans!

   In the sixth place, as we have seen, in Dan. 11:36 the Anti-christ is
   termed "the king" and if a king he must possess a kingdom, and can
   there be any doubt as to the identity of this kingdom? Will not
   Anti-christ's kingdom be the very one which Satan offered in vain to
   Christ? namely, "all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them"
   (Matt. 4:8). That the kingdom of the Anti-christ will be much wider
   than Palestine appears from Dan. 11:40-42--"And at the time of the end
   shall the king of the south push at him (the Anti-christ) and the king
   of the north shall come against him (the Anti-christ) like a whirlwind,
   with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he (the
   Anti-christ) shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and
   pass over. He (the Anti-christ) shall enter also into the glorious
   land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape
   out of his (the Anti-christ's) hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief
   of the children of Ammon (compare other Old Testament prophecies
   concerning these three powers). He (the Anti-christ) shall stretch
   forth his hand upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not
   escape." From this Scripture it is also clear that the Anti-christ will
   be at the head of a great army and therefore a political ruler as well
   as a religious chief.

   In the seventh place, it is generally agreed among those students of
   prophecy who belong to the Futurist school that the rider upon the four
   horses of Rev. 6 is the Anti-christ. If this be the case then we have
   further proof that the Anti-christ and the Head of the revived Roman
   empire is one and the same person. This may be seen by comparing three
   Scriptures. In Rev. 6:8, of the rider on "the pale horse," we read,
   "His name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him." In
   Isaiah 28:18, those who will be in Jerusalem during the Tribulation
   period are addressed by Jehovah as follows: "And your covenant with
   Death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with Hell shall not
   stand." What "covenant" can this be except the one mentioned in Dan.
   9:27 where we read of the Roman Prince (the Head of the revived Roman
   empire) confirming the covenant with the many for seven years. Now
   reverse the order of these three passages, and what do we learn? In
   Dan. 9:27 we learn that the head of the Roman empire makes a "covenant"
   with the Jews. In Isaiah 28:18 this "covenant" is said to have been
   made with "Death and Hell." While in Rev. 6:8 the rider on the pale
   horse (which it is generally admitted is the Anti-christ) is named
   "Death and Hell." Hence, from whatever angle we approach the subject it
   is seen that the Anti-christ is the Head of the fourth world-kingdom.

   Finally, we wish to call attention to the employment of the definite
   article in connection with the two "Beasts" of Rev. 13. Wherever we
   read of the Beast, it is the Anti-christ who is in view. In 13:1 we
   read, "And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
   out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns
   ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy"--this is the
   empire itself with its seven mountains and ten kings (see 17:9, 12).
   But from 13:2-8 it is always "the Beast," the Head of the empire, the
   Anti-christ. So in 19:20 and and 20:10. The Anti-christ is termed The
   Beast in contradistinction to Jesus Christ who is denominated "The
   Lamb."
