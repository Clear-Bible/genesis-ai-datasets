   PSALM 67

   The following psalm contains a prayer for a blessing upon the Church,
   that besides being preserved in a state of safety in Judea, it might be
   enlarged to a new and unprecedented extent. It touches shortly upon the
   kingdom of God, which was to be erected in the world upon the coming of
   Christ. [1]

   Psalm 67:1-7

   1. God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine
   upon us. Selah. [2] 2. That they may know thy way upon the earth, thy
   salvation among all nations. 3. Let the people praise thee, O God! let
   all the people praise thee. 4. Let the nations be glad, and shout for
   joy; for he shall judge the people righteously, and thou shalt govern
   the nations upon earth. Selah. 5. Let the people praise thee, O God:
   let all the people praise thee. 6. The earth has given its increase;
   and God, even our own God!, will bless us. 7. God shall bless us, [3]
   and all ends of the earth shall fear him.


   1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us The psalm contains a prediction
   of Christ's kingdom, under which the whole world was to be adopted into
   a privileged relationship with God; but the Psalmist begins by praying
   for the Divine blessing, particularly upon the Jews. They were the
   first-born, (Exodus 4:22,) and the blessing was to terminate upon them
   first, and then go out to all the surrounding nations. I have used the
   imperative mood throughout the psalm, as other translators have done,
   although the future tense, which is that employed in the Hebrew, would
   suit sufficiently well, and the passage might be understood as
   encouraging the minds of the Lord's people to trust in the continuance
   and increase of the Divine favor. The words, however, are generally
   construed in the form of a prayer, and I merely threw out this as a
   suggestion. Speaking, as the Psalmist does, of those who belonged to
   the Church of God, and not of those who were without, it is noticeable
   that yet he traces all the blessings they received to God's free favor;
   and from this we may learn, that so long as we are here, we owe our
   happiness, our success, and prosperity, entirely to the same cause.
   This being the case, how shall any think to anticipate his goodness by
   merits of their own? The light of God's countenance may refer either to
   the sense of his love shed abroad in our hearts, or to the actual
   manifestation of it without, as, on the other hand, his face may be
   said to be clouded, when he strikes terrors into our conscience on
   account of our sins, or withdraws the outward marks of his favor.

   2 That they may know thy way upon the earth. Here we have a clear
   prophecy of that extension of the grace of God by which the Gentiles
   were united into one body with the posterity of Abraham. The Psalmist
   prays for some conspicuous proof of favor to be shown his chosen
   people, which might attract the Gentiles to seek participation in the
   same blessed hope. [4] By the way of God is meant his covenant, which
   is the source or spring of salvation, and by which he discovered
   himself in the character of a Father to his ancient people, and
   afterwards more clearly under the Gospel, when the Spirit of adoption
   was shed abroad in greater abundance. [5] Accordingly, we find Christ
   himself saying,

   "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,"
   (John 17:3)

   3 Let the people praise thee, O God! Having spoken of all nations
   participating in the saving knowledge of God, he next tells us that
   they would proclaim his goodness, and exhorts them to the exercise of
   gratitude. The repetition used clearly shows of itself that he alludes
   to an event of a new and unprecedented kind. Had the allusion been to
   some such manifestation of his favor as he ordinarily made to the Jews,
   we would not have looked for the same vehemency of expression. First he
   says, Let the people praise thee; then he adds, Let all the people
   praise thee Afterwards he repeats the exclamation once more. But he
   appropriately makes mention, between, of rejoicing, and the occasion
   there was for it, since it is impossible that we can praise God aright,
   unless our minds be tranquil and cheerful -- unless, as persons
   reconciled to God, we are animated with the hope of salvation, and "the
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding," reign in our hearts,
   (Philippians 4:7.) The cause assigned for joy plainly in itself points
   to the event of the calling of the Gentiles. The reference is not to
   that government of God which is general in its nature, but to that
   special and spiritual jurisdiction which he exercises over the Church,
   in which he cannot properly be said to govern any but such as he has
   gathered under his sway by the doctrine of his law. The word
   righteousness is inserted in commendation of his government. Language
   almost identical is used by Isaiah and Micah when they speak of the
   times in which the word of salvation would be diffused throughout all
   the earth, (Isaiah 11:4; Micah 4:3.)

   6 The earth has given its increase Mention having been made of the
   principal act of the Divine favor, notice is next taken of the temporal
   blessings which he confers upon his children, that they may have
   everything necessary to complete their happiness. And here it is to be
   remembered, that every benefit which God bestowed upon his ancient
   people was, as it were, a light held out before the eyes of the world,
   to attract the attention of the nations to him. From this the Psalmist
   argues, that should God liberally supply the wants of his people, the
   consequence would be, to increase the fear of his name, since all ends
   of the earth would, by what they saw of his fatherly regard to his own,
   submit themselves with greater cheerfulness to his government.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] This verse contains a manifest allusion to the blessings which the
   priests were taught to pronounce upon the people of Israel, (Numbers
   6:24-26.)

   [3] God, even our own God, will bless us, God shall bless us. There is
   here again clearly an allusion to the formula of blessing in Numbers
   6:24-26, where the name of God is, as here, repeated three times in
   succession.

   [4] "A fin que par la clarte d'icelle les Gentils soyent amenez a la
   participation de la mesme esperance." -- Fr.

   [5] "The petition here offered is, that the Gospel, God's way,' might
   be universally spread; -- a prayer that is not yet accomplished, but is
   in progress towards completion. The mention of nations and peoples, all
   of them, intimates, that the time which is the object of supplication
   is the time when God will no longer be the God of the Jews, but of the
   Gentiles also." -- Walford.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] With this agrees the opinion of the ancient Jews, who apply this
   psalm to future times, to the world to come, the times of the Messiah.
   The particular time and occasion of its composition can only be
   conjectured. Bishop Patrick thinks that it was probably composed by
   David, when, having brought the ark to Jerusalem and offered
   sacrifices, as promised in the psalm foregoing, verse 15, he blessed
   the people in the name of the Lord of Hosts, (2 Samuel 6:17, 18.)
   Horsley views it as "a hymn for the feast of tabernacles, prophetic of
   a general conversion of the world to the worship of God." Calmet is of
   opinion that the composition of this, as well as of the two preceding
   psalms, was posterior to the return of the Jews from Babylon; and that
   the particular occasion was the restoration of fertility to the soil
   after the protracted drought and scarcity recorded by the prophet
   Haggai, (Haggai 1:10,11; 2:17-19.) But though the particular time and
   occasion on which it was written cannot with certainty be determined,
   it is evidently a prayer of the ancient Church for the appearance of
   the Messiah, and the universal diffusion of his gospel.

   PSALM 68

   In this psalm it was David's design to celebrate the victories which,
   through the blessing of God, he had gained over his enemies; [6] but,
   in the opening verses, he commends the power and goodness of God
   generally, as seen in the government of the world at large. From this
   he passes to the consideration of what God had done in redeeming his
   chosen people, and of the continued proofs of fatherly care which he
   had manifested to the posterity of Abraham. He then proceeds to the
   subject which he had more particularly in view, prosecuting it at
   length, and in terms of the most exalted description; praising the
   signal display of Divine power which he, and the whole nation with him,
   had experienced. Now that he had been made king, he infers that the
   Church was brought to a settled condition, and that God, who seemed to
   have departed, would now at length erect his throne, as it were, in the
   midst of it, and reign. In this it would evidently appear, that he
   designed, typically, to represent the glory of God afterwards to be
   manifested in Christ.

   Psalm 68:1-6

   1. God shall arise: his enemies shall be scattered; and they who hate
   him shall flee before him. 2. As smoke is driven away, thou shalt drive
   them away; as wax melteth before the fire, the wicked shall perish from
   the presence of God. 3. But the righteous shall be glad; they shall
   rejoice before God, and leap for exultation. 4. Sing unto God, sing
   praises to his name: exalt him that rideth upon the clouds in Jah [7]
   his name, [or, in his name Jah,] and rejoice before him. 5. A father of
   the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in the habitation of
   his holiness. 6. God who setteth the solitary in families, who
   bringeth, out those who are bound with chains; [8] but the rebellious
   shall dwell in a dry land.


   1. God shall arise: his enemies shall be scattered In this verse the
   Psalmist intimates, as it were by way of preface, the subject which he
   proposed to treat in the psalm, and which related to the truth that
   God, however long he may seem to connive at the audacity and cruelty of
   the enemies of his Church, will eventually arise to avenge it, and will
   prove himself able to protect it by the mere forth-putting of his hand.
   I agree with other interpreters in thinking that the sentiment is
   borrowed from Moses, (Numbers 10:35) [9] There can be little doubt that
   in dictating the form of prayer there referred to, he had an eye to the
   instruction and comfort of all succeeding ages, and would teach the
   Lord's people confidently to rely for safety upon the ark of the
   covenant, which was the visible symbol of the Divine presence. We may
   notice this difference, however, that Moses addressed the words to God
   as a prayer, while David rather expresses his satisfaction and delight
   in what he saw daily fulfilling before his own eyes. Some indeed read,
   Let God arise; but they appear to misapprehend the scope of the
   Psalmist. He means to say that observation attested the truth which
   Moses had declared of God's needing only to rise up that all his
   enemies might be scattered before his irresistible power. Yet I see no
   objections to the other reading, provided the idea now mentioned be
   retained, and the words be considered as intimating that God needs no
   array of preparation in overthrowing his enemies, and can dissipate
   them with a breath. We are left to infer, that when his enemies at any
   time obtain an ascendancy, it is owing to an exercise of Divine
   forbearance, and that rage as they may, it is only with his permission;
   the time being not yet come for his rising. There is much comfort to be
   derived from the circumstance, that those who persecute the Church are
   here spoken of as God's enemies. When he undertakes our defense, he
   looks upon the injuries done to us as dishonors cast upon his Divine
   Majesty. The Psalmist adds a striking figure to illustrate how easily
   God can overthrow the machinations of our enemies, comparing them to
   smoke which vanishes when blown upon by the wind, or wax which melts
   before the fire [10] We consider it utterly incredible that such a
   formidable array of opposition should be made to disappear in a moment.
   But the Spirit takes this method of chiding the fearfulness of our
   carnal minds, and teaching us that there is no such strength in our
   enemies as we suppose, -- that we allow the smoke of them to blind our
   eyes, and the solid mass of resistance which they present to deceive us
   into a forgetfulness of the truth, that the mountains themselves flow
   down at the presence of the Lord. [11]

   3 But the righteous shall be glad It is here intimated by David, that
   when God shows himself formidable to the wicked, this is with the
   design of securing the deliverance of his Church. He would seem
   indirectly to contrast the joy of which he now speaks with the
   depression and grief felt by well affected men under the reign of Saul
   -- suggesting, that God succeeds a season of temporary trouble with
   returns of comfort, to prevent his people from being overwhelmed by
   despondency. He leaves us also to infer, that one reason of that joy
   which they experience is derived from knowing that God is propitious to
   them, and interests himself in their safety. The Hebrew words, mphny,
   mipne, and lphny, liphne, admit of the same meaning; but I think that
   the Psalmist intended to note a distinction. The wicked flee from the
   presence of God, as what inspires them with terror; the righteous again
   rejoice in it, because nothing delights them more than to think that
   God is near them. When commenting upon the passage, Psalm 18:26, we saw
   why the Divine presence terrifies some and comforts others; for "with
   the pure he will show himself pure, and with the froward he will show
   himself froward." One expression is heaped by the Psalmist upon
   another, to show how great the joy of the Lord's people is, and how
   entirely it possesses and occupies their affections.

   4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: exalt him [12] that rideth,
   etc. He now proceeds to call upon the Lord's people to praise God. And
   he begins by pointing out the grounds in general, as I have already
   hinted, which they have for this exercise, because he comprehends the
   whole world under his power and government, adding, that he condescends
   to take the poorest and the most wretched of our family under his
   protection. His infinite power is commended, when it is said that he
   rides upon the clouds, or the heavens, [13] for this proves that he
   sits superior over all things. The Holy Spirit may signify by the
   expression, that we should exclude from our minds every thing gross and
   earthly in the conceptions we form of him; but he would, doubtless,
   impress us chiefly with an idea of his great power, to produce in us a
   due reverence, and make us feel how far short all our praises must come
   of his glory. We would attempt in vain to comprehend heaven and earth;
   but his glory is greater than both. As to the expression which follows,
   in Jah, his name, there has been some difference of opinion. The Hebrew
   preposition v, beth, may here, as sometimes it is, be a mere expletive,
   and we may read, Jah is his name [14] Others read, in Jah is his name;
   [15] and I have no objection to this, though I prefer the translation
   which I have adopted. It is of less consequence how we construe the
   words, as the meaning of the Psalmist is obvious. The whole world was
   at that time filled with the vain idols of superstition, and he would
   assert the claim of God, and set them aside when he brought forward the
   God of Israel. But it is not enough that the Lord's people should bow
   before him with suppliant spirits. Even the wicked, while they fear and
   tremble before him, are forced to yield him reverence. David would have
   them draw near to him with cheerfulness and alacrity; and, accordingly,
   proceeds to insist upon his transcendent goodness shown in
   condescending to the orphans and widows. The incomprehensible glory of
   God does not induce him to remove himself to a distance from us, or
   prevent him from stooping to us in our lowest depths of wretchedness.
   There can be no doubt that orphans and widows are named to indicate in
   general all such as the world are disposed to overlook as unworthy of
   their regard. Generally we distribute our attentions where we expect
   some return. We give the preference to rank and splendor, and despise
   or neglect the poor. When it is said, God is in the habitation of his
   holiness, this may refer either to heaven or to the temple, for either
   sense will suit the connection. God does not dwell in heaven to indulge
   his own ease, but heaven is, as it were, his throne, from which he
   judges the world. On the other hand, the fact of his having chosen to
   take up his residence with men, and inviting them familiarly to himself
   there, is one well fitted to encourage the poor, who are cheered to
   think that he is not far off from them. In the next verse, other
   instances of the Divine goodness are mentioned -- that he gives the
   bereaved and solitary a numerous offspring, and releases the bonds of
   the captive. In the last clause of the verse, he denounces the judgment
   of God against those who impiously despise him, and this that he might
   show the Lord's people the folly of envying their lot as well as strike
   terror into their minds. The sense of the words is, That we ought to
   comfort ourselves under the worst afflictions, by reflecting that we
   are in God's hand, who can mitigate all our griefs and remove all our
   burdens. The wicked, on the other hand, may congratulate themselves for
   a time upon their prosperity, but eventually it will fare ill with
   them. By dwelling in a dry land, is meant being banished, as it were,
   to a wilderness, and deprived of the benefits of that fatherly kindness
   which they had so criminally abused.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] "C'est, Qui est Jah, ou l'Eternel?" -- Fr. marg. "That is, Who is
   Jah, or Jehovah?" Jah seems simply a contraction of the word Jehovah,
   the name which expresses, as far as can be expressed by words, the
   essence, self-existence, and eternity of the Supreme Being.

   [8] The original word vkvsrvt, bakosharoth, which Calvin renders, with
   chains, is rendered by Dathe, ad abundantiam; and by Berlin, ad
   opimitates; and is explained by Simeon, in his Lexicon, as "loca
   omnibus affluentia proprie abundantiae." According to Gesenius, kvsrh
   denotes "happiness, abundance, prosperity." The LXX. render it en
   andreia, in strength, i e., bound firmly. Fry reads, "Bringing forth
   prisoners into scenes of plenty."

   [9] That passage contains the words which Moses used when the ark began
   a procession. Whenever the tabernacle was moved, and the Levites
   marched onward, bearing upon their shoulders the ark of the covenant,
   and the whole host of Israel proceeded on their march, "Moses said,
   Rise up, Lord," etc. Martin observes, that "the God whom these opening
   words of the psalm have in view is manifestly the same of whom it is
   said in verse 18, that he ascended up on high, and led captivity
   captive. Now he of whom that is said, being, according to the
   interpretation of the Apostle Paul, (Ephesians 4:8,) Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, it clearly follows that it was the Son of God, the true
   God, Jehovah the eternal God, whom the Prophet had in his eye in the
   first verse and in the rest of the psalm." [2]See Appendix.

   [10] As wax melteth before the fire, "a proverbial expression, denoting
   speedy dissolution, consumption, and death." -- Bythner.

   [11] "Sed quasi fumo hebetari nostros oculos; falli etiam nos in ipsa
   duritie, quia non reputamus solo Dei conspectu liquefieri montes
   ipsos." -- Lat. "Mais qu'il y a comme une fumee qu'il nous esblouist
   les yeux; semblablement que nons nous abusons quant a leur durete et
   obstination; pource que nous ne venons point a considerer qu'au seul
   regard de Dieu les montagnes mesmes fondent et s'ecoulent." Fr.

   [12] The reading of the Septuagint is, Odopoiesate, "Make way." The
   Hebrew word slv, sollu, has this sense, as well as that of exalt In two
   passages in Isaiah, the forms of expression are very like the present
   passage, (Isaiah 57:14,) "Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way;" and
   (Isaiah 62:10,) "Cast up, cast up the highway." Jerome has, "Praeparate
   viam," "Prepare yea way." Walford adopts the same translation, --
   "Prepare a way for him who rideth through the deserts," -- which he
   explains in the following note: "The imagery is borrowed from the
   custom of Eastern princes, who sent pioneers before their armies, to
   reduce the hills, and carry raised roads through the valleys, to
   facilitate their progress. God is described as riding through the
   deserts, from his having accompanied Israel through the wilderness, to
   conduct them to Canaan."

   [13] The word vrvvt, baaraboth, here rendered the clouds, or the
   heavens, is by the LXX. translated the west, as if it were derived from
   rv, ereb, evening; and by the Vulgate, "Super occasum," "Upon the going
   down of the sun." Others translate it "deserts." Thus, Jerome reads,
   "ascendenti per deserta," "for him that rideth through the deserts." In
   this he is followed by Dr Boothroyd, Bishops Lowth and Horsley, Drs
   Kennicott and Chandler, Fry, and others; but critics of no less note
   read heavens, as Paginus, Buxtorf, and Hammond. "The feminine rvh,"
   says this last critic, "is frequently taken for a plain, and so for the
   desert; but rvvt, in the plural, is acknowledged by the Hebrews to
   signify the heavens." The idea is altogether fanciful which has been
   put forth by some, that this word, which frequently signifies a plain
   or desert, is applied to the highest heavens, "either as being plain
   and void of stars, and so a kind of superior desert, without anything
   in it, or (as the learned Grotius piously conjectures from 1 Timothy
   6:16) because, as a desert, it is aprosoiton, not approached or
   approachable by any."

   [14] This is the rendering in all the ancient versions, as the
   Septuagint, Chaldee, Syriac, Vulgate, etc. Many instances might be
   produced in which v it is redundant; as, for example, Exodus 32:22,
   Proverbs 3:26

   [15] This is the translation given by Horsley, who applies the passage
   to Christ; and his criticism upon it is excellent. "Upon mature
   consideration," says he, "I am inclined to take the text as it stands,
   and render it literally with Jerome, In Jah is his name;' i e., his
   name, who is riding through the wilderness, is in Jehovah, in the
   Self-existent One. He who led the armies of Israel through the
   wilderness, when they first came up from Egypt, was Christ. He who
   brought the captives home from Babylon was Christ. He who shall finally
   bring the revolted Jews home to his Church, and, in a literal sense,
   bring the nation home to its ancient seat, is Christ. Christ,
   therefore, is intended here, under the image of one riding through the
   wilderness, (ascendenti per deserta,' Jerome,) not upon the heavens, at
   the head of the returning captives. His name is in Jah:' Christ's name
   is in Jehovah. sm, the Name,' is used, in the Hebrew language, for the
   thing imperfectly apprehended, to which, however, a name belongs. Thus,
   for God all languages have a name; and all men have an idea of the
   Being intended by that name, as the First Cause, the Maker, and
   Governor of the universe. Yet the human intellect, -- we may say, more
   generally, the created intellect, -- comprehends not the nature of this
   Great Being, nor can it enumerate his attributes. The name of God' is
   the incomprehensible Being who is all that the name imports, more than
   is expressed; more, at least, than any name can express to the finite
   understanding. Thus, when we are commanded to fear the name of God, the
   injunction is, that we carry in our minds a constant fear of the Being
   to whom that name belongs. The name, therefore, of Christ is Christ
   himself, considered as known by a name, but yet imperfectly understood,
   or rather incomprehensible in his nature. The sentence, His name is in
   Jehovah,' is an emphatical assertion of his divinity, introduced here
   to justify and enforce the worship enjoined. Sing unto God, sing
   praises to his name: cast up a way for him that is riding through the
   wilderness.' Who is he that is riding through the wilderness, that we
   should pay him this respect? He,' says the Psalmist, who cannot be
   described.' His name is in Jah.' His name and his nature are involved
   in the name and nature of the Godhead. Name him: you name the
   All-glorious One. Name the All-glorious One: you name him. Name him as
   distinct from the All-Good and Glorious: you name him not aright."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 68:7-10

   7. O God! when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst
   march through the wilderness; Selah: 8. The earth was moved, the
   heavens also dropped at the presence of this God: Sinai at the presence
   of God, the God of Israel. [16] 9. Thou, O God! shalt make a liberal
   [17] rain to fall upon thine inheritance, and thou refreshest it when
   it is weary. 10. Thy congregation [18] shall dwell therein; thou, O
   God! wilt prepare in thy goodness for the poor.


   7 O God! when thou wentest forth before thy people, etc. The Psalmist
   now proceeds to show that the Divine goodness is principally displayed
   in the Church, which God has selected as the great theater where his
   fatherly care may be manifested. What follows is evidently added with
   the view of leading the posterity of Abraham, as the Lord's chosen
   people, to apply the observations which had been just made to
   themselves. The deliverance from Egypt having been the chief and
   lasting pledge of the Divine favor, which practically ratified their
   adoption under the patriarch, he briefly adverts to that event. He
   would intimate that in that remarkable exodus, proof had been given to
   all succeeding ages of the love which God entertained for his Church.
   Why were so many miracles wrought? why were heaven and earth put into
   commotion? why were the mountains made to tremble? but that all might
   recognize the power of God as allied with the deliverance of his
   people. He represents God as having been their leader in conducting
   them forth. And this not merely in reference to their passage of the
   Red Sea, but their journeys so long as they wandered in the wilderness.
   When he speaks of the earth being moved, he would not seem to allude
   entirely to what occurred upon the promulgation of the law, but to the
   fact that, throughout all their progress, the course of nature was
   repeatedly altered, as if the very elements had trembled at the
   presence of the Lord. It was upon Mount Sinai, however, that God issued
   the chief displays of his awful power; it was there that thunders were
   heard in heaven, and the air was filled with lightnings; and,
   accordingly, it is mentioned here by name as having presented the most
   glorious spectacle of the Divine majesty which was ever beheld. Some
   read, This Sinai, etc., connecting the pronoun zh, zeh, with the
   mountain here named; but it is much more emphatical to join it with the
   preceding clause, and to read, the heavens dropped at the presence of
   This God; David meaning to commend the excellency of the God of Israel.
   The expression is one frequently used by the prophets to denote that
   the God worshipped by the posterity of Abraham was the true God, and
   the religion delivered in his law no delusion, as in Isaiah 25:9,
   "This, this is our God, and he will save us." To establish the Lord's
   people in their faith, David leads them, as it were, into the very
   presence of God; indicates that they were left to no such vague
   uncertainties as the heathen; and indirectly censures the folly of the
   world in forsaking the knowledge of the true God, and fashioning
   imaginary deities of its own, of wood and stone, of gold and silver.

   9. Thou, O God! shalt make a liberal rain to fall [19] upon thine
   inheritance Mention is made here of the continued course of favor which
   had been extended to the people from the time when they first entered
   the promised land. It is called the inheritance of God, as having been
   assigned over to his own children. Others understand by the inheritance
   spoken of in the verse, the Church, but this is not correct, for it is
   afterwards stated as being the place where the Church dwelt. The title
   is appropriately given to the land of Canaan, which God made over to
   them by right of inheritance. David takes notice of the fact, that,
   from the first settlement of the seed of Abraham in it, God had never
   ceased to make the kindest fatherly provision for them, sending his
   rain in due season to prepare their food. The words translated a
   liberal rain, read literally in the Hebrew a rain of freenesses, and I
   agree with interpreters in thinking that he alludes to the blessing as
   having come in the exercise of free favor, [20] and to God, as having
   of his own unprompted goodness provided for all the wants of his
   people. Some read a desirable rain; others, a rain flowing without
   violence, or gentle; but neither of these renderings seems eligible.
   Others read a copious or plentiful rain; but I have already stated what
   appears to me to be the preferable sense. It was a proof, then, of his
   Divine liberality, that God watered the land seasonably with showers.
   There is clearly a reference to the site of Judea, which owed its
   fertility to dews and the rains of heaven. In allusion to the same
   circumstance, he speaks of its being refreshed when weary. The reason
   is assigned -- because it had been given to his chosen people to dwell
   in. On no other account was it blessed, than as being the habitation of
   God's Church and people. The more to impress upon the minds of the Jews
   their obligations to Divine goodness, he represents them as pensioners
   depending upon God for their daily food. He fed them upon the finest of
   the wheat, giving them wine, and honey, and oil in abundance -- still
   he proportioned the communication of his kindness so as to keep them
   always dependent in expectation upon himself. Some, instead of reading,
   Thou wilt prepare with thy goodness, etc., render it, Thou wilt prepare
   with rich food; but, without absolutely objecting to this translation,
   I rather think that he adverts to the circumstance of God's being led
   to provide for his people entirely by his own good pleasure.

   Psalm 68:11-14

   11. The [21] Lord shall give the word to the women who announce the
   great army. [22] 12. Kings of armies shall flee -- shall flee; and she
   that tarries at home shall divide the spoil. 13. Though you should lie
   among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with
   silver, and which behind is of the paleness of gold. [23] 14. When the
   Almighty scattered kings in it, thou shalt make it white [24] in
   Salmon.


   11. The Lord shall give the word, etc. David now adverts to the
   victories by which God had signally displayed his power in behalf of
   his people. He had himself been the instrument of restoring peace to
   the country, by putting down its foes, and he had extended the
   boundaries of the kingdom; but he ascribes the praise of all that had
   been done in stratagems and counsels of war to God. In representing God
   as issuing orders for the song of triumph, he intimates, figuratively,
   that it is he who determines the successful issue of battles. Notice is
   taken of the women who announce the army, for it was the custom
   anciently for women to sing the song of triumph, as Miriam, the sister
   of Moses, with her companions, sounded the praises of God upon the
   timbrel, and the women celebrated David's victory upon the harp, when
   he slew Goliath, and routed the Philistines, (Exodus 15:20; Judges
   11:34; 1 Samuel 18:6.) In making this reference to a song of praise,
   the Psalmist, as I have already said, intended to impress the truth
   upon the people, that the victories gained were entirely owing to God;
   though, at the same time, he tacitly reminds them of its being their
   duty to proclaim his benefits with due gratitude.

   From the verse which succeeds, we are taught that the mightiest
   preparations which the enemies of the Church may make for its
   destruction shall be overthrown. We may consider the words as spoken in
   the person of the Psalmist himself, or as forming the song of the women
   mentioned above. It was a circumstance illustrative of the Divine
   favor, that the most formidable kings, before whom the Jews could never
   have stood in their own strength, had been put to flight. That princes,
   who could easily have overrun the world with their forces, should have
   not only departed without obtaining their purpose, but been forced to
   fly to a distance, could be accounted for on no other supposition than
   God's having stood forward signally as their defender. In the Hebrew
   the verb is repeated, they shall flee, they shall flee, signifying that
   the attacks of the enemy had been repelled by Divine assistance once
   and again. The greatness of the spoil taken is intimated by the
   circumstance stated, that a share of it would come even to the women
   who remained at home. While the soldiers would return from battle
   clothed with the spoils, such would be the quantity of booty taken,
   that the females, who took no part in war, would partake of it.

   13. Though ye should lie among the pots [25] Having spoken of God as
   fighting the battles of his people, he adds, by way of qualification,
   that they may lie for a time under darkness, though eventually God will
   appear for their deliverance; There can be little doubt that he hints
   at the state of wretchedness and distress to which the nation had been
   reduced under the government of Saul, for the interposition was the
   more remarkable, considering the misery from which it had emerged. The
   words, however, convey a further instruction than this. They teach us
   the general truth, that believers are, by the hidden and mysterious
   power of God, preserved unhurt in the midst of their afflictions, or
   suddenly recovered so as to exhibit no marks of them. The language
   admits of being interpreted to mean either that they shine even when
   lying under filth and darkness, or that, when freed from their
   troubles, they shake off any defilement which they may have contracted.
   Let either sense be adopted, and it remains true that the believer is
   never consumed or overwhelmed by his afflictions, but comes out safe.
   An elegant figure is drawn from the dove, which, though it lie amongst
   the pots, retains the beauty which naturally belongs to it, and
   contracts no defilement on its wings. From this we learn that the
   Church does not always present a fair or peaceable aspect, but rather
   emerges occasionally from the darkness that envelops it, and recovers
   its beauty as perfectly as if it had never been subjected to calamity.

   14. When the Almighty scattered kings in it We might read extended, or
   divided kings, etc., and then the allusion would be to his leading them
   in triumph. But the other reading is preferable, and corresponds better
   with what was said above of their being put to flight. There is more
   difficulty in the second part of the verse, some reading, it was white
   in Salmon; that is, the Church of God presented a fair and beautiful
   appearance. Or the verb may be viewed as in the second person -- Thou,
   O God! Didst make it fair and white as mount Salmon [26] with snows The
   reader may adopt either construction, for the meaning is the same. It
   is evident that David insists still upon the figure of the whiteness of
   silver, which he had previously introduced. The country had, as it
   were, been blackened or sullied by the hostile confusions into which it
   was thrown, and he says that it had now recovered its fair appearance,
   and resembled Salmon, which is well known to have been ordinarily
   covered with snows. [27] Others think that Salmon is not the name of a
   place, but an appellative, meaning a dark shade. [28] I would retain
   the commonly received reading. At the same time, I think that there may
   have been an allusion to the etymology. It comes from the word tslm,
   tselem, signifying a shade, and mount Salmon had been so called on
   account of its blackness. [29] This makes the comparison more striking;
   for it intimates, that as the snows whitened this black mountain, so
   the country had resumed its former beauty, and put on an aspect of joy,
   when God dispelled the darkness which had lain upon it during the
   oppression of enemies. [30]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] Dr Geddes here observes, that "the poet passes rapidly from former
   times to his own days, and the occasion of composing his psalm, namely,
   the discomfiture and flight of the combined kings of Syria, Ammon,
   Moab, and Edom: for with all these David had been engaged in this war."

   [22] The original word for "the women who announce" is hmvsrvt,
   hamebasseroth It is from vsr, bisser, "to announce joyous tidings;"
   and, being a participle of the feminine gender, is very properly
   referred to women, who were wont to celebrate victories, or any kind of
   good news, with songs and music. But we find it on one occasion used to
   express melancholy news, (1 Samuel 4:17.) The women here are
   represented as announcing the victory by singing congratulatory songs.
   All the difficulty is, whether hmvsrvt, hamebasseroth, be in the dative
   or the genitive case. If in the genitive case, then tsv', tsaba, which
   Calvin renders army, must, as Hammond observes, be rendered company --
   great was the company of the women who thus sang; and tsv', an host, is
   often taken for the congregation or assembly employed in the service of
   God. But it, may also be taken in the dative, as the same critic
   remarks, and as Calvin here renders it. Castellio gives a similar
   translation. "And thus the LXX. may be understood: O Theos Kurios dosei
   rhema tois euangelisamenois (I suppose it should be tais
   euangelisameiais) dunamei pollo; the Lord shall give the word or matter
   to the women that evangelise to or for the great army;' i e., which
   supply the office of proecones thereto, in proclaiming their victories;
   though it is certain the Latin that renders it virtute multa,' by much
   virtue,' did not thus understand it." -- Hammond

   [23] "Et posteriora ejus in pallore auri." -- Lat. In the French it is,
   "Et laquelle par derriere est comme fin or bien jaune;" -- "and which
   behind is as fine yellow gold."

   [24] "Ou, elle fust blanche." -- Fr. marg. "Or, it was white."

   [25] The interpretation of this verse is attended with great
   difficulty. Speaking of it and the following verse, Dr Lowth says, "I
   am not at all satisfied with any explication I have ever met with of
   these verses, either as to sense or construction, and I must give them
   up as unintelligible to me. Houbigant helps out the construction in his
   violent method: Aut invenit viam, aut facit.'" It is pretty generally
   admitted, that in the first part of this verse a "state of wretchedness
   and distress," as Calvin remarks, is indicated; but it is difficult to
   ascertain the meaning of the word sphtym, shephataim, which he renders
   pots, and, consequently, to ascertain to what the allusion particularly
   is. None of the old translators have so rendered it; and numerous
   significations have been given to it. The Chaldee renders it, "bounds
   in the divisions of the way;" the Syriac and Arabic, "paths" or "ways;"
   the Septuagint, kleron, "allotments," "inheritances," or "portions,"
   apparently deriving the word from spht, divisit, ordinavit, and perhaps
   attaching to it a similar idea as in the preceding translations, men's
   portions of land or possessions having been divided and distinguished
   by paths Jerome, adhering to the Septuagint, makes it "inter medios
   terminos." Thus, the word will not be without significance, expressing
   a forlorn and wretched condition, lying down betwixt the bounds; that
   is, in the highways. But many modern critics think that it signifies
   something in relation to pots, and that it may very probably be the
   same as that which the Arabs call 't'phy, Athaphi, stones set in a
   chimney for a pot to rest on, the pots being without legs. "Of these,"
   says Hammond, "the Arabians had three, and the third being commonly (to
   them in the desert) some fast piece of a rock, or the like, behind the
   pot, -- as in a chimney the back of the chimney itself, and that not
   looked on as distinct from the chimney, -- the other two at the sides,
   which were loose, might fitly be here expressed in the dual number
   sphtym; and then the lying between these will betoken a very low,
   squalid condition, as in the ashes, or amidst the soot and filth of the
   chimney." "These two renderings," he adds, "may seem somewhat distant;
   and yet, considering that the termini or bounds in divisions of ways
   were but heaps of stones, or broken bricks, or rubbish, the word
   sphtym, which signifies these, may well signify these supporters of the
   pots also, in respect of the matter of these being such stones or
   broken bricks." Parkhurst takes a view somewhat similar to this last
   interpretation. He reads, "among the fire ranges," or "rows of stones."
   "Those," says he, "on which the caldrons or pots were placed for
   boiling; somewhat like, I suppose, but of a more structure, than those
   which Niebuhr says are used by the wandering Arabs. Their fire-place is
   soon constructed: they only set their pots upon several separate
   stones, or over a hole digged in the earth.' Lying among these denotes
   the most abject slavery; for this seems to have been the place of rest
   allotted to the vilest slaves. So, old Laertes, grieving for the loss
   of his son, is described by Homer (in the Eleventh Book of the Odyssey)
   as, in the winter, sleeping where the slaves did, in the ashes near the
   fire: -- --Oqi dmwev eni oikw
   En koni agci purov.'" See his Lexicon on spht ii. The Chaldee has
   "broken bricks," or "rubbish," that are thrown away; the word,
   according to this sense, being derived from sphh, shephah, to bruise,
   to trample on A similar noun, 'spht, ashpoth, derived from the verb
   sphh, is used in Psalm 113:7, for a dunghill, or the vilest place,
   whither all kinds of rubbish are cast out, and where the poor are said
   to lie. When Job was brought by Satan to the lowest depths of
   affliction, he sat down among the ashes, and scraped himself with a
   potsherd, which indicated the state of extreme sadness and debasement
   to which he was reduced. If this is the sense here, "lying among the
   broken bricks or rubbish" expresses, in like manner as the preceding
   translations, the most mean, dejected, and wretched condition. Harmer's
   attempt to explain this passage is at least very ingenious: -- As
   shepherds in the East betake themselves, during the night, for shelter
   to the caves which they find in their rocky hills, where they can
   kindle fires to warm themselves, as well as dress their provisions, and
   as doves, as well as other birds, frequently haunt such places, he
   conjectures that the afflicted state of Israel in Egypt is here
   compared to the condition of a dove making its abode in the hollow of a
   rock which had been smutted by the fires which the shepherds had made
   in it. He supposes the word here translated pots to mean the little
   heaps of stones on which the shepherds set their pots, there being a
   hollow under them to contain the fire. -- Harmer's Observations, volume
   1, pp. 176, 177. Gesenius thinks the word is equivalent to hmsphtym,
   hammishpethaim, which occurs in Judges 5:16, and which our English
   version makes "sheepfolds," the only difference between the two words
   being, that the word here wants the formative letter m, mem Thus, it
   may refer to the condition of the Israelites when living among their
   flocks in the wilderness. We have not yet exhausted the different
   significations affixed by commentators to this word; but, without
   referring to more, we shall only add, that, according to some, the
   allusion is to the condition of the Israelites in Egypt, who were
   doomed to the drudgery of brick-making and pottery, and had probably to
   sleep among the brick-kilns or earthenware manufactories in which they
   were employed. With respect to the second clause of the verse, in which
   an image taken from the dove is introduced, a difficulty which has been
   stated is, how her feathers can be said to resemble yellow gold. From
   the circumstance, that the splendor of gold is here intermingled,
   Harmer concludes that this is not a description of the animal merely as
   adorned by the hand of nature, but that the allusion is to white doves
   that were consecrated to the Syrian deities, and adorned with trinkets
   of gold, the meaning being, "Israel is to me as a consecrated dove; and
   though your circumstances have made you rather appear like a poor dove,
   blackened by taking up its abode in a smoky hole of the rocks, yet
   shall you become beautiful and glorious as a Syrian silver-coloured
   pigeon, on which some ornament of gold is put." -- Harmer's
   Observations, volume 1, p. 180. But there are certainly doves which
   answer to the description here given, some of them having the feathers
   on the sides of the neck of a shining copper color, which in a bright
   sun must resemble gold. See Encyc. Brit. Art. Columbia. Besides, the
   reference is not necessarily to the color of gold, but to its
   brilliancy. How highly poetical an emblem, to depict the glorious
   change effected in the condition of the Hebrews by the deliverance
   which God had granted them over the proud and formidable enemies who
   had kept them in the degrading condition represented in the first
   clause of the verse!

   [26] Salmon is the name of a mountain in Samaria, in the tribe of
   Ephraim, (Judges 9:48,) white with perpetual snow.

   [27] Carrieres, in his paraphrase, has, "You became white as snow on
   mount Salmon." "We certainly think," says the author of the Illustrated
   Commentary upon the Bible, "that Carrieres has seized the right idea.
   The intention evidently is, to describe by a figure the honor and
   prosperity the Hebrews acquired by the defeat of their enemies, and to
   express this by whiteness, and superlatively by the whiteness of snow.
   Nothing can be more usual in Persia, for instance, than for a person to
   say, under an influx of prosperity or honor, or on receiving happy
   intelligence, My face is made white;' or gratefully, in return for a
   favor or compliment, You have made my face white;' so also, His face is
   whitened,' expresses the sense which is entertained of the happiness or
   favor which has before been received. Such a figurative use of the idea
   of whiteness does, we imagine, furnish the best explanation of the
   present and some other texts of Scripture."

   [28] Instead of "in Salmon," the Targum has, "in the shade of death;"
   and Boothroyd has, "The Almighty having scattered these kings,
   hath by this turned death-shade to splendor." Walford gives a similar
   version, and explains the meaning to be, "Though you have been in
   bondage and the darkness of a dejected condition, you are now
   illuminated with the splendor of victory and prosperity."

   [29] That is, it was so called from the dark shade produced by its
   trees.

   [30] "Que comme les neiges font blanchir ceste montagne, laquelle de
   soy est obscure et noire, ainsi quand il a pleu a Dieu d'oster
   l'obscurite qu'apportoit l'affliction des ennemis, lors on a veu la
   terre reluire d'un lustre naif, et par maniere de dire, porter une face
   joyeuse." -- Fr.

   Psalm 68:15-17

   15. The hill of God, the hill of Bashan, a high hill, [31] the hill of
   Bashan. 16. Why leap ye, ye high hills? the hill which God desireth to
   dwell in; yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever. 17. The chariots of
   God are twenty thousand thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as
   in Sinai, in the holy place.


   15. The hill of God, the hill of Bashan Here he adverts to the spring
   and source of all the kindness which God had shown, this being the
   circumstance that he had chosen mount Zion as the place of his palace
   and temple, whence all blessings should go out to the nation. A Divine
   declaration to that effect had been made to David, and this
   pre-eminence and dignity conferred upon mount Zion is very properly
   adduced as a proof of his being king, lawfully and by Divine
   appointment; for there was an inseparable connection between God's
   dwelling upon that mountain, and David's sitting upon the throne to
   govern the people. The words of the verse admit of two senses. We may
   suppose that the mountain of God is compared to mount Bashan as being
   like it, or we may understand that it is opposed to it. The first is
   the sense adopted almost by all interpreters, that while Bashan was
   famed for its fertility, Zion excelled it. It is of little importance
   which we prefer; but perhaps the distinction would be brought out as
   well were we to construe the words the hill of God by themselves, and
   consider that Bashan with its boasted height is afterwards ordered to
   yield precedence, as if David would say, that there was but one
   mountain which God had consecrated to himself by an irrevocable decree,
   and that though Bashan was renowned for height and fertility, it must
   rank with other mountains, which might in vain exalt themselves to an
   equality with Zion, honored as the chosen residence of God. If we read
   the verse differently, and consider it as applying to mount Zion
   throughout, then the Psalmist extols it as high and illustrious, and
   this because there emanated from it the Divine favor, which
   distinguished the Jews from every other nation.

   16. Why leap ye, [32] ye high hills? In this verse there is no
   obscurity or ambiguity. David having said that there was only one
   mountain in all the world which God had chosen, calls upon the highest
   hills to yield it the pre-eminency. As he repeats in the plural number
   what had been said immediately before of Bashan, this leads me to think
   that he intended first to oppose that mountain, and then all other high
   mountains generally, to Zion. [33] Mountains are here to be understood
   figuratively, and the great truth conveyed is, that the kingdom of
   Christ, which God had begun to shadow forth in the person of David, far
   excels all that is reckoned glorious by the world. The reproof which
   the Psalmist administers, in order to humble the proud boasting of the
   world, is justified by that contempt which we know that carnal and
   ungodly persons entertain of Christ's kingdom, devoted as they are to
   their own pleasures or wealth, and unable to appreciate spiritual
   blessings. The lesson will be felt to be the more useful and necessary,
   if we consider that this vain pride of man rises to an additional
   height, when the slightest occasion is afforded for its exercise. When
   we see those indulging it who have no grounds to do so, we need not
   wonder at the arrogance of such as are possessed of wealth and
   influence. But the Lord's people may afford to leave them to their
   self-complacency, resting satisfied with the privilege of knowing that
   God has chosen to take up his habitation in the midst of them. They
   have no reason to repine at their lot so long as they have union with
   God, the only and the sufficient source of their happiness.

   17. The chariots of God are twenty thousand thousands of angels. [34]
   For the most part, we are apt to undervalue the Divine presence, and
   therefore David presents us with a description fitted to exalt our
   thoughts of it. Owing to our unbelieving hearts, the least danger which
   occurs in the world weighs more with us than the power of God. We
   tremble under the slightest trials; for we forget or cherish low views
   of his omnipotence. To preserve us from this error, David directs us to
   the countless myriads of angels which are at his command, -- a
   circumstance, the consideration of which may well enable us to defy the
   evils which beset us. Twenty thousand are spoken of; but it is a number
   designed to intimate to us that the armies of the living God, which he
   commissions for our help, are innumerable; and surely this should
   comfort us under the deadliest afflictions of this life. In adding that
   the Lord is among them, the Psalmist is still to be considered as
   designing to give us an exalted view of what is included in God's
   presence; for the words suggest that he can no more divest himself of
   his existence than not have this power whereby angels are subordinated
   to his will. Another idea suggested is, that one God is better than a
   universe of angels. The great distance to which we are apt to conceive
   God as removed from us is one circumstance which tries our faith, and
   in order to obviate this, the Psalmist reminds us of Sinai, where there
   was a display of his majesty. The inference was conclusive that he
   still abode in the sanctuary. For why did God appear upon that occasion
   in such a glorious manner? Evidently to show that his covenant formed a
   sacred bond of union between him and the posterity of Abraham. Hence
   the words of Moses --

   "Say not in thine heart, Who shall go up into heaven? or who shall
   descend into the deep? or who shall go over the sea? For the word is
   nigh unto thee," etc. (Deuteronomy 30:12.)

   Sinai accordingly is mentioned by David, to teach us that if we would
   fortify our minds with a firm faith in the Divine presence, we must
   derive it from the Law and the Prophets.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [31] "La montagne des hauteurs," "the hill of highnesses or eminences."
   -- Fr. That is, (says Calvin, on the margin,) "treshaute," "very high."
   The literal rendering of the original words is, "a hill of
   gibbosities," "a hill with humps," i e., projections, eminences. This
   seems peculiarly applicable to Bashan, which had many tops; and this
   may explain the origin of the name of that mountain. It has its name
   from sn, a tooth; and hr vsn, the mountain with teeth, might be given
   to it, from the appearance of the face of it studded over with small
   hills. See Street, in loco What is here rendered "a high hill," is, in
   the Septuagint, rendered oros teturomenon, and in the Vulgate, "mons
   coagulatus," "cheesey, full of cheeses;" or, as Hammond renders it, "a
   hill that yielded much butter and cheese," Bashan being a rich and
   fertile mountain beyond Jordan. Horsley has, "a hill of lofty brows;"
   and Fry, "a hill of swelling heights."

   [32] The word here rendered leap ye "occurs only here," observes
   Hammond, "and is by guess rendered to leap, or lift up, or exalt one's
   self; but may best be interpreted, not leap as an expression of joy,
   but lift up, or exalt yourselves, as an effect of pride;" and he
   understands the meaning to be, Why do ye lift up or exalt yourselves,
   ye high hills, God not having chosen any of the highest hills to build
   his temple on, but the hill of Zion, of a very moderate size, lower
   than the hill of Hermon, and at the foot of it, (Psalm 133:3.) Some
   Jewish commentators, founding their opinion on the cognate Arabic word
   rtsr, would render it, to look after This gives the same sense. What
   look ye for? what expect ye, ye high hills, to be done to you? Ye are
   not those which God has chosen to beautify with his glorious presence,
   but mount Zion is the object of his choice. Aquila and Jerome read,
   "Why contend ye?" Dr Chandler renders it, "Why look askance?" i e.,
   "with jealous leer malign," as Milton expresses it. "Why are ye
   jealous?" Horsley, following Jerome, has, "For what would ye contend?"

   [33] "The Psalmist," says Horsley, "having settled the Israelites
   between their hills, proceeds to the circumstance of God's choice of a
   hill for the site of his temple. He poetically imagines the different
   hills as all ambitious of the honor, anxiously waiting God's decision,
   and ready to enter into a jealous contention; watching each other with
   an anxious eye. The lofty hill of Bashan first puts in his claim,
   pleading his stately height -- The hill for God is the hill of Bashan;
   A hill of lofty brows is the hill of Bashan. The Psalmist cuts short
   the contention -- For what would ye contend, ye hills of lofty brows?
   This is the hill desired of God for himself to dwell in;
   Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever."

   [34] The words 'lphy sn'n, alphey shinan, which Calvin renders
   "thousands of angels," are literally "thousands of repetition;" the
   noun sn'n, shanan, being derived from snh, shanah, he repeated or
   reiterated Accordingly, the reading which many prefer is, "The chariots
   of God are twenty thousand thousands multiplied or reiterated."
   Hammond, who adopts this translation, observes, that "though angels are
   not mentioned, they are to be understood, as Jude 14, muriades hagiai,
   holy myriads." Horsley reads, "Twenty thousand thousand of thousands is
   the cavalry of God." "The cavalry of God," says he, "is every thing in
   nature which he employs as the instruments or vehicles of his power.
   The image, which some would introduce here of God riding in a car drawn
   by angels, I cannot admire; nor do I think that it is really to be
   found in any passage of Scripture rightly understood." But God, though
   not here represented as riding on a car drawn by angels, is
   undoubtedly, in the most magnificent style of Eastern poetry,
   represented as riding on his exalted car, attended by legions of
   angels, mounted also on cars. Comp. Deuteronomy 32:3, and 2 Kings 6:16.
   French and Skinner give a different view of the passage, which brings
   out a very good sense -- "God hath been to them [the Israelites] twice
   ten thousand chariots,
   Even thousand of thousands." Chariots were much used in war by the
   nations of antiquity; and the chosen people were forbidden to use
   chariots and horses in war; but God was to them as effectual a
   safe-guard as innumerable war-chariots would have been. He was "the
   chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof," 2 Kings 2:12. Comp. Psalm
   20:7. And in his protection and aid they were to trust. "When thou
   goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and
   chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the
   Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of
   Egypt." "For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for
   you against your enemies to save you," (Deuteronomy 20:1 and 4.)

   Psalm 68:18-24

   18. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: [35]
   thou hast received gifts among men; [36] even the rebellious, that the
   Lord Jehovah [37] might dwell amongst his people. 19 Blessed be the
   Lord daily: this Lord will load us with deliverances. Selah. 20. He
   that is our God is the God of salvations; and to the Lord Jehovah [38]
   belong the issues from death. 21. Surely God shall wound the head of
   his enemies, the crown of the hair of him who walketh on in his
   wickedness. 22. The Lord said, I will bring back from Bashan; I will
   bring again from the depths of the sea: 23. That thy foot may be
   stained with blood, the tongue of thy dogs even in that of thine
   enemies. 24. They have seen thy goings, O God! even the goings of my
   God, my King, in the sanctuary.


   18. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive There
   can be little doubt that these words are intended to magnify the proofs
   of Divine favor granted upon the elevation of David to the throne, by
   contrasting the state of matters with that under Saul. The ascending on
   high implies the being previously low, and intimates, that under the
   melancholy confusions which had prevailed in the kingdom, there was no
   longer the same conspicuous display of the Divine glory as formerly.
   The government of Saul, which, from the first, had originated in a way
   that was condemnable, was doomed to fall under the displeasure of God,
   while his favor, on the other hand, was to be restored under David; and
   the undeniable appearances of this left no room for doubt that one who
   began his reign under such auspices was the object of the Divine
   choice. David, although he had acquitted himself with courage in the
   battles which were fought, ascribes all the glory of them to God,
   saying, that it was he who had taken captive the enemy, and forced them
   to pay tribute, and reduced the more fierce and rebellious to
   subjection. By the term svrrym sorerim, rebellious, contumacious, or
   revolters, he would evidently seem to mean a distinct class of persons
   from the other enemies, whom he mentions as having been taken captive;
   and it intimates, that while those who did not venture to resist, and
   who surrendered, had been brought under the yoke, the more proud and
   unyielding had been forced into submission. The end designed by this is
   stated in the words which follow, that God might dwell in the midst of
   his people; and that he might demonstrate himself to be an
   all-sufficient protector to those who put their trust in him.

   As the passage which we have now been considering is applied by Paul in
   a more spiritual sense to Christ, (Ephesians 4:8,) it may be necessary
   to show how this agrees with the meaning and scope of the Psalmist. It
   may be laid down as an incontrovertible truth, that David, in reigning
   over God's ancient people, shadowed forth the beginning of Christ's
   eternal kingdom. This must appear evident to every one who remembers
   the promise made to him of a never-failing succession, and which
   received its verification in the person of Christ. As God illustrated
   his power in David, by exalting him with the view of delivering his
   people, so has he magnified his name in his only begotten Son. But let
   us consider more particularly how the parallel holds. Christ, before he
   was exalted, emptied himself of his glory, having not merely assumed
   the form of a servant, but humbled himself to the death of the cross.
   To show how exactly the figure was fulfilled, Paul notices, that what
   David had foretold was accomplished in the person of Christ, by his
   being cast down to the lowest parts of the earth in the reproach and
   ignominy to which he was subjected, before he ascended to the right
   hand of his Father, (Psalm 22:7.) That in thinking upon the ascension,
   we might not confine our views to the body of Christ, our attention is
   called to the result and fruit of it, in his subjecting heaven and
   earth to his government. Those who were formerly his inveterate enemies
   he compelled to submission and made tributary -- this being the effect
   of the word of the Gospel, to lead men to renounce their pride and
   their obstinacy, to bring down every high thought which exalteth
   itself, and reduce the senses and the affections of men to obedience
   unto Christ. As to the devils and reprobate men who are instigated to
   rebellion and revolt by obstinate malice, he holds them bound by a
   secret control, and prevents them from executing intended destruction.
   So far the parallel is complete. Nor when Paul speaks of Christ having
   given gifts to men, is there any real inconsistency with what is here
   stated, although he has altered the words, having followed the Greek
   version in accommodation to the unlearned reader. [39] It was not
   himself that God enriched with the spoils of the enemy, but his people;
   and neither did Christ seek or need to seek his own advancement, but
   made his enemies tributary, that he might adorn his Church with the
   spoil. From the close union subsisting between the head and members, to
   say that God manifest in the flesh received gifts from the captives, is
   one and the same thing with saying that he distributed them to his
   Church. What is said in the close of the verse is no less applicable to
   Christ -- that he obtained his victories that as God he might dwell
   among us. Although he departed, it was not that he might remove to a
   distance from us, but, as Paul says, "that he might fill all things,"
   (Ephesians 4:10.) By his ascension to heaven, the glory of his divinity
   has been only more illustriously displayed, and though no longer
   present with us in the flesh, our souls receive spiritual nourishment
   from his body and blood, and we find, notwithstanding distance of
   place, that his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed.

   19. Blessed be the Lord, etc. David would have us to understand, that
   in recounting the more particular deliverances which God had wrought,
   he did not mean to draw our minds away from the fact, that the Church
   is constantly and at all times indebted for its safety to the Divine
   care and protection. He adds, Blessed be God daily And he intimates,
   that deliverances might be expected from him with great abundance of
   every blessing. Some read, he will load, others, he will carry; [40]
   but it is of little importance which reading we adopt. He points at the
   fact, that God extends continued proofs of his kindness to his people,
   and is unwearied in renewing the instances of it. I read this Lord in
   the second part of the verse, for the letter h, he, prefixed in the
   Hebrew, has often the force of a demonstrative pronoun; and he would
   point out, as it were with the finger, that God in whom their
   confidence ought to be placed. So in the next verse, which may be read,
   this our God is the God of salvation What is here said coincides with
   the scope of what immediately precedes, and is meant to convey the
   truth that God protects his Church and people constantly. In saying
   this God, he administers a check to the tendency in men to have their
   minds diverted from the one living and true God. The salvation of God
   is set before the view of all men without exception, but is very
   properly represented here as something peculiar to the elect, that they
   may recognize themselves as continually indebted to his preserving
   care, unlike the wicked, who pervert that which might have proved life
   into destruction, through their unthankfulness. The Hebrew word in the
   20th verse is salvations, in the plural number, to convince us that
   when death may threaten us in ever so many various forms, God can
   easily devise the necessary means of preservation, and that we should
   trust to experience the same mercy again which has been extended to us
   once. The latter clause of the verse bears the same meaning, where it
   is said, that to the Lord belong the issues of death Some read, the
   issues unto death, [41] supposing that the reference is to the ease
   with which God can avenge and destroy his enemies; but this appears a
   constrained interpretation. The more natural meaning obviously is, that
   God has very singular ways, unknown to us, of delivering his people
   from destruction. [42] He points at a peculiarity in the manner of the
   Divine deliverances, that God does not generally avert death from his
   people altogether, but allows them to fall in some measure under its
   power, and afterwards unexpectedly rescues them from it. This is a
   truth particularly worthy of our notice, as teaching us to beware of
   judging by sense in the matter of Divine deliverances. However deep we
   may have sunk in trouble, it becomes us to trust the power of God, who
   claims it as his peculiar work to open up a way where man can see none.

   21. Surely God shall wound, etc. The enemies of the Church are fierce
   and formidable, and it is impossible that she can be preserved from
   their continued assaults, without a vigorous protection being extended.
   To persuade us that she enjoys such a defense, David represents God as
   armed with dreadful power for the overthrow of the ungodly. The verse
   stands connected as to scope with the preceding, and we might render
   the Hebrew particle 'k, ach, by wherefore, or on which account; but it
   seems better to consider it as expressing simple affirmation. We are to
   notice the circumstance, that God counts all those his enemies who
   unjustly persecute the righteous, and thus assures us of his being
   always ready to interpose for our defense. The concern he feels in our
   preservation is forcibly conveyed by the expressions which follow, that
   he will wound the head of his enemies, and the crown of their hair;
   [43] intimating, that he will inflict a deadly and incurable wound upon
   such as harass his Church. This is still more strikingly brought out in
   what is added immediately afterwards, when God is described as wading
   through destruction.

   22. The Lord said, I will bring back from Bashan. That the Israelites
   might not be led to take an irreligious and self-glorious view of their
   victories; that they might look to God as the author of them; and rest
   assured of his protection in time to come, David sends them back to the
   first periods of their history, and reminds them how their fathers had
   been originally brought by the victorious hand of God out of the lowest
   depths of trouble. He would have them argue that if God rescued his
   people at first from giants, and from the depths of the Red Sea, it was
   not to be imagined that he would desert them in similar dangers, but
   certain that he would defend them upon every emergency which might
   occur. The prophets are in the constant habit, as is well known, of
   illustrating the mercy of God by reference to the history of Israel's
   redemption, that the Lord's people, by looking back to their great
   original deliverance, might find an argument for expecting
   interpositions of a future kind. To make the deeper impression, God is
   introduced speaking himself. In what he says he may be considered as
   asserting his Divine prerogative of raising the dead to life again, for
   his people's passage through the Red Sea, and victory over warlike
   giants, was a species of resurrection. [44] Some read, I will cause the
   enemy to fly from Bashan; [45] but this cannot be received, and does
   not agree with the context, as it follows, I will bring back from the
   depths of the sea In representing God as bedewed or stained with blood,
   David does not ascribe to him anything like cruelty, but designs to
   show the Lord's people how dear and precious they are in his sight,
   considering the zeal which he manifests in their defense. We know that
   David himself was far from being a man of cruel disposition, and that
   he rejoiced in the destruction of the wicked from the purest and most
   upright motives, as affording a display of the Divine judgments. That
   is here ascribed to God which may be asserted equally of his Church or
   people, for the vengeance with which the wicked are visited is
   inflicted by their hands. Some read the close of the verse, the tongue
   of thy dogs in thine enemies, even in him, i.e., the king and chief of
   them all. This is not the meaning of the Psalmist, which simply is,
   that the tongues of the dogs would be red with licking blood, such
   would be the number of dead bodies scattered round.

   24. They have seen thy goings, O God! This verse may refer to
   processions of a warlike kind, or to such as are made in times of peace
   by those who give thanks for victory. It is customary for the people of
   God, on occasions of the latter description, to go forth and present
   peace-offerings in the temple. This has led some to understand by the
   goings of God, [46] the crowds of his people when they proceed to the
   temple. But I am disposed to think that God himself is here represented
   as a king leading and marshalling forth his armies. Accordingly, it is
   added, in the sanctuary, under which expression there is an apt
   allusion to the visible symbol of the Divine presence. The great reason
   why God undertakes the guardianship of his people, and goes before them
   to repel the attacks of the enemy, is his having promised that he will
   hear their prayers in the sanctuary. He is therefore described as if he
   were seen coming out of his holy habitation, that he might conduct his
   people to victory. David calls him his King, to divert the attention of
   the people from himself, and lead them to view a name which belonged to
   a frail mortal man such as he was, in its higher application to the
   supreme Head of all. He speaks, it is true, in the name of the people,
   but not to the exclusion of himself.

   and by virtue of his incarnation, and it is in consequence of his being
   made man that it may be said, the Lord God dwells among them;' for
   Jesus was called Immanuel, God with us,' in consequence of his
   incarnation."

   times, 'dny seven times, and 'l five times in this psalm, yhvh only
   occurs twice." -- Rogers' Book of Psalms in Hebrew, etc. volume 2, p.
   221.

   [39] Paul's words are not exactly those of the Septuagint, the present
   reading of which is, elabes domata en anthropo, "Thou hast received
   gifts for man;" while Paul's words are, edoke domata tois anthropois
   But Bloomfield thinks that en asthropo in the Septuagint is a
   corruption for ep' anthropois; and that Paul read in that version
   elathes domata ep' anthropois, which is the true sense of the Hebrew
   words, being no other than this, "Thou hast received gifts on account
   of men;" i e., to give to men. Paul, therefore, might say edoke instead
   of elathes epi, to make the sense plainer; as also does the Chaldee
   Paraphrast, and the Syriac and Arabic translators. Paul's words are
   evidently not intended to be a regular quotation, as appears from his
   changing the second person into the third.

   [40] "The word mm, amas, which we translate to load, signifies to lift,
   bear up, support, or, to bear a burden for another Hence it would not
   be going far from the ideal meaning to translate, Blessed be the Lord,
   day by day, who bears our burthens for us.'" -- Dr Adam Clarke
   Boothroyd, on the contrary, asserts, that "as an active verb it
   signifies to load, to lay a burthen on another,' but in no instance to
   bear or support one, 1 Kings 12:2."

   [41] The Septuagint has, Tou Kuriou diexodoi tou thanatou, "To the Lord
   belong the passages of death," expressing the ways by which death goes
   out upon men to destroy them. The Vulgate has, "exitus mortus," "the
   goings out of death;" and the Chaldee Paraphrast, "From before the
   Lord, death, and the going out of the soul to suffocation, do contend
   or fight against the wicked." Hammond follows the LXX. He observed,
   that the original words "must literally be rendered goings forth to
   death, and must signify the several plagues and judgments inflicted by
   God on impenitent enemies, the ways of punishing and destroying the
   Egyptians and Canaanites, drowning in the sea, killing by the sword,
   infesting by hornets, etc.; and these are properly to be attributed and
   imputed to God, as the deliverances of the Israelites, his people, in
   the former part of the verse; and to this sense the consequents
   incline, verse 21, Even God shall wound.' Horsley reads the verse, "He
   that is our God is a God of salvation,
   And for death are the goings forth of the Lord Jehovah; "i.e.," says
   he, "When Jehovah takes the field, deadly is the battle to his
   enemies."

   [42] Agreeably to this, Hewlett observes, that the "issues of death
   mean the many providential escapes and deliverances from death;" and
   Boothroyd reads, "For to Jehovah we owe our escapes from death." The
   Syriac version has, -- "The Lord God is the Lord of death and of
   escaping."

   [43] Bishops Hare and Horsley suppose that there is here an allusion to
   the usage of the people in those Arabian regions, who nourished their
   hair on the crown of their head, that by their unshorn heads and shaggy
   hair they might appear more fierce. "The expressions, the head,' and
   the hairy crown,'" observes Bishop Horne, "denote the principal part,
   the strength, the pride, and the glory of the adversary which was to be
   crushed;" and Roberts, in his Oriental Illustrations, observes, that
   "this language, wounding the crown of the hair,' still used in the
   East, is equivalent to saying, I will kill you.'"

   [44] Or, "I will bring again from Bashan," may be thus explained. I
   will perform for my people the like wonders which I did in the days of
   old; I will render them victorious over their proud enemies, as I
   before enabled them to triumph in the conflict with Og king of Bashan,
   (Deuteronomy 3:3, 4;) and I will deliver them from the greatest
   dangers, as I saved them from the Red Sea, by opening up a passage for
   them through the midst of it.

   [45] Walford considers the persons here intended, not God's people, but
   their enemies. "It is evident," says he, "from the next verse, that the
   persons who are here meant are the enemies of God and his people;
   because the purpose for which they were to be brought was, that his
   people might completely triumph over them in their utter slaughter and
   destruction. These, he says, I will bring back from Bashan, and from
   the abysses of the sea; thus referring to the victories that had been
   gained over the kings of the Canaanites, and the triumph of Israel at
   the Red Sea. The design of this declaration is, to express the
   determination of God to bring forth all his enemies to destruction: be
   they on the heights of Bashan, or in the profoundest depths of the
   ocean, they shall not escape; his hand will lay hold upon them, and his
   power utterly destroy them. In Amos 9:2, and in Obadiah 4, there are
   two sublime illustrations of the sentiment that is here delivered."
   "Bashan was east of Judea," says Boothroyd, "and the sea in the west,
   so that the meaning is, that God would bring his enemies from every
   quarter to be slain by his people."

   [46] "This doubtless refers to the order of the procession then on its
   march, and to that of religious processions in general. In the
   religious and festal processions of the Hindoos there is the same order
   and classes of performers. The singers, men and women, precede, singing
   songs appropriate to the occasion; and then the players on instruments
   follow after." -- Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible.

   Psalm 68:25-27

   25. The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after;
   in the midst were the damsels playing with timbrels. [47] 26. Bless ye
   God in the congregations, even the Lord, O ye who are of the fountain
   of Israel! 27. There is little Benjamin their ruler, the princes of
   Judah in their assembly, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of
   Naphtali.


   25. The singers went before It is evident that he does not now speak of
   an army in battle array, but of a solemn assembly held for offering up
   thanksgivings to God for victory. God had openly shown that he was
   their leader in war, and to him the song of triumph is with propriety
   addressed. Mention is made of distinct choirs employed in his service,
   and particularly of such as played upon the timbrel; for, absurd as the
   practice may appear to us, it was then customary for the women to play
   upon that instrument. By the fountain [48] from which they are called
   upon to bless God, some understand the heart, as it is known that those
   praises which proceed from the lips merely, and are hypocritical, meet
   with the Divine reprobation. But I conceive the true meaning to be,
   that all are summoned to praise the Lord who could deduce their origin
   from the patriarch Jacob. Many might not sustain the character which
   answered to their high vocation; but, as the whole race had been chosen
   of God, the Psalmist very properly invites them to engage in this
   devotional exercise. At the same time, I see nothing objectionable in
   the opinion, if any persist in preferring it, that the term is here
   used to distinguish the true saints of God from those who vainly
   boasted of being the posterity of Abraham, while they had degenerated
   from his spirit. Those only who walk in the footsteps of his faith are
   reckoned to be his children. It has caused some surprise that, in a
   general description of the sacred assemblies of the people, precedence
   should have been given to the tribe of Benjamin According to certain
   interpreters, this is owing to the position which it occupied, as being
   next to David; and honor is put upon the tribes of Zebulun and
   Naphtali, [49] which, though they lay at a great distance, were in a
   particular manner friendly and attached to him. Others think that the
   whole nation is represented under the tribes specified, which were at
   once the nearest and most distant. [50] These conjectures [51] are
   probable enough, but the point is one which may be left in uncertainty,
   as there may have been some other reason, which it is impossible for us
   to discover. It has been suggested that Benjamin is called little on
   account of the smallness of its numbers, the tribe having been nearly
   exterminated for the crime of the men of Gibeah, (Judges 19:20;) but
   David would not probably have adverted to any reproach of this kind in
   calling them to take so prominent a part in the praises of God. [52]
   The inspired writers, in speaking of the tribes, often allude to the
   patriarchs from whom they respectively took their origin; nor is it
   surprising that the posterity of Benjamin, who was the youngest of
   Jacob's children, [53] should receive the designation here given to
   them; and the truth is, that even antecedently to the heavy stroke
   which befell them, they were not numerous. Interpreters, by general
   consent, have considered that Benjamin is called ruler, as Saul, who
   was first made king in Israel, belonged to this tribe; but I cannot
   bring myself to think it probable that David would have made such an
   unseasonable allusion to Saul's memory, whose government is everywhere
   represented in Scripture as pregnant with disaster, and which was to be
   buried in that of his successor, whose reign is so prominently brought
   forward in this psalm. The more likely conjecture is, that this title
   of dignity is applied in order to put honor upon a tribe, which some
   might despise for its smallness, and to intimate that the Benjamites,
   though few in numbers, and not possessed of great influence, formed one
   head in Israel as well as the rest. [54] Others may be disposed to
   think that there must have been some illustrious individual in this and
   the two tribes mentioned along with it, or that the whole tribe had
   signalised itself in a recent battle. Though honorable mention is made
   of these tribes, yet the chief place in the numbers assembled together
   at this time is assigned to the princes of Judah. Some think that the
   copulative is understood, and read, the princes of Judah and their
   congregation The Hebrew word which we translate congregation is by
   others translated stoning. [55] But it seems preferable to construe the
   words as implying that this tribe presided over the assembly which
   marched under its auspices in war. The power of summoning the people
   together is thus asserted as belonging to Judah, and it is represented
   as honored with the government and primacy of the kingdom.

   [47] "The musical instrument here rendered timbrels' was a sort of
   small drum, carried in the hand, (Exodus 15:20,) and played on by
   beating with the hand or fingers, as is probable from Nahum 2:7. It was
   used both on civil and religious occasions; and is often mentioned, as
   here, to have been beaten by women, but was sometimes played on by men.
   It was very like, if not the same kind of instrument as the modern
   Syrian diff, which is described by Dr Russell as a hoop, (sometimes
   with bits of brass fixed in it to make a jingling,) over which a piece
   of parchment is distended. It is beat with the fingers; and is the true
   tympanum of the ancients, as appears from its figure in several
   relievos representing the orgies of Bacchus, and the rites of Cybele.
   It is worth observing, that, according to Juvenal, the Romans had this
   instrument from Syria.' Niebuhr also has given us a similar
   description, and a print of an instrument which, (according to his
   German spelling,) he says, they call doff: He informs us that they hold
   it by the bottom, in the air, with one hand, while they play on it with
   the other.' The Oriental diff appears to be very like what is known to
   the French and English by the name of tambourine." -- Mant.

   conjectural emendation gives a good sense; but it seems unnecessary.
   Instead of mmqvr, mimmekor, he proposes to read mqvr, mekor; and then
   the passage would run thus: -- "The fount whence blessings spring to
   Israel's race." Horsley reads, "The Lord of the stock of Israel;" and
   explains it of the Messiah, who was of the stock of Israel according to
   the flesh. Fry conceives that the reading more strictly may be, "from
   the quarry of Israel; dug, as it were, from this pit, hewn from this
   rock. See Isaiah 51:1." "They blessed Elohim in the congregations,
   The Lord from the stock of Israel, (or from the quarry of Israel.)"

   [49] Zebulun and Naphtali were in Galilee, divided from the country of
   the half-tribe of Manasseh; the former by the Jordan, the latter by the
   Lake of Gennesareth.

   [50] Why these tribes in particular? May it be, Judah (having, instead
   of Reuben, succeeded to the blessing which conveyed the privilege of
   having the Chief Ruler and Messiah of his line) and Benjamin (tsyr) the
   youngest? or Judah and Benjamin, as two of the tribes most southern and
   nearest to Jerusalem; and Zebulun and Naphtali, as two of the most
   northern and most remote? as another way of expressing from Dan to
   Beersheba,' to include them all." -- Dr Lowth

   [51] Of other conjectures the following are a specimen: "As for Zebulun
   and Naphtali, why their names are here added rather than any of the
   other tribes, the reason may, perhaps, best be taken from what we find
   prophesied of those two (Genesis 49 and Deuteronomy 33 and Judges 5.)
   by Jacob and Moses and Deborah, that learning and knowledge should be
   most eminent in those two tribes. Of Naphtali it is said, (Genesis
   49:21,) Naphtali is a hind let loose; he giveth goodly words;' and of
   Zebulun, (Judges 5:14,) They shall handle the pen of the writer.'" --
   Hammond. "It then specifies the tribes of Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali,
   not as if they were the only tribes present, but as occupying, perhaps,
   the foremost ranks of the procession, and followed by all the other
   tribes." -- Walford.

   [52] "Car David appelant yci ceux qui devoyent faire le plus grand
   devoir et estre les premiers a annoncer les louanges de Dieu, n'eust
   pas fait mention de ceste acte qui estoit ignominieux, et tendoit
   grandement a leur deshonneur." -- Fr.

   [53] The Septuagint has, "There is Benjamin the younger." He was the
   son of Jacob's old age; and to this there is an allusion in the name,
   which is compounded of vn, ben, a son, and ymyn, yamin, of days,
   (according to the Chaldee plural termination, yn, yin,) intimating that
   he was the son of his father's old age, (Genesis 44:20,) and not, as is
   commonly said, the son of my right hand -- Bythner

   [54] "Caput tamen unum efficere." -- Lat. "Font toutesfois un chef
   comme les autres lignees." -- Fr.

   [55] The word rgmtm, rigmatham, here translated congregation or
   assembly, signifies, according to Parkhurst, a heap of stones for
   defence, a bulwark of stones; and he considers it to be here applied
   metaphorically to the princes of Judah, who, so to speak, were the
   bulwark of Israel. Horsley adopts the same reading: "The princes of
   Judah their bulwark." Hammond, after stating that the word signifies a
   stone, observes, that it "is here used in a metaphorical sense for a
   ruler or governor, as a foundation-stone which supports the whole
   building may fitly be applied to a commonwealth, and then signify the
   prince thereof." In this sense the LXX., no doubt, understood rgmtm,
   rigmatham, who render it hegemones auton, "their governors." "It may
   mean," says Pike, in his Hebrew Lexicon, "their supreme authority,
   signified by stoning, a capital punishment among the Israelites, in the
   same manner as it was represented among the Romans by the Fasces and
   Securis, the instruments of punishment carried before the Consuls."
   Jerome, however, has taken it for another word nearly similar to it in
   its letters, signifying purple, -- "in purpura sua;" -- but this comes
   to the same thing as the Septuagint translation. Dathe has "agmen," "a
   troop;" and according to Gesenius, it signifies "a multitude, crowd,
   band."

   Psalm 68:28-30

   28. Thy God hath commanded thy strength; strengthen, O God! that which
   thou hast wrought in us. 29. From thy temple upon Jerusalem kings shall
   bring presents unto thee. 30. Destroy the company of spearmen,
   (literally, of the reed,) the multitude of bulls with the calves of the
   people, treading with their feet upon pieces of silver: scatter thou
   the people that delight in war.


   28. Thy God hath commanded thy strength Men are always disposed to
   arrogate to themselves the glory of what they may have done instead of
   tracing their success to God, and David reminds the people once more
   that they had not triumphed by their own strength, but by power
   communicated from above. If they had acquitted themselves with energy
   on the field, he would have them consider that it was God who inspired
   them with this valor, and would guard them against the pride which
   overlooks and disparages the Divine goodness. As a consideration which
   might farther tend to promote humility in their minds, he adverts to
   the dependence in which they stood of the future continuance of the
   same favor and protection; this being the great cause of presumptuous
   confidence, that we do not feel our own helplessness, and are not led
   under a sense of it to resort humbly to God for the supply of our
   wants. Another lesson which the passage teaches us is, that more is
   required than that God should visit us at first with his preventing
   grace; that we stand constantly in need of his assistance throughout
   our whole lives. If this be true in the literal warfare, where our
   conflict is with flesh and blood, it must be still more so in matters
   of the soul. It is impossible that we could stand one moment in the
   contest with such enemies as Satan, sin, and the world, did we not
   receive from God the grace which secures our perseverance.

   What is said of the temple in the following verse is intended to carry
   out the same strain of sentiment which has been already expressed. It
   gives the reason why God had exerted his power in behalf of the
   Israelites rather than others; which was, that it might be displayed as
   coming forth from the sanctuary and the ark of the covenant. Hence the
   emphasis with which David calls him in a previous part of the psalm --
   the God of Israel. It was not in vain that God had erected his
   sanctuary, or promised his presence in connection with it; and his
   power is here represented as issuing from the temple, to denote that
   the only security for his favor was to be found in his gracious
   covenant and promises. Some read, From thy temple in Jerusalem -- a
   frigid interpretation, and one which does not express the meaning of
   the Psalmist. His prayer is to the effect that the Divine power might
   be commanded from the sanctuary upon his chosen people, here denoted by
   a common figure of speech by Jerusalem. It may be asked how he speaks
   of the temple, when it had not been yet built. The word temple or
   palace may have been used to express the tabernacle. This, at least, I
   think more probable than that he should speak of the temple by
   anticipation, as some suppose; and there can be no doubt that the ark
   had already been placed in Zion. Having already traced all the honor of
   the recent victories to God, he next proceeds to vindicate his claim to
   reap the fruits of them, by asserting that the kings who had been
   subdued would acknowledge God to have been their conqueror, as well as
   yield themselves tributary to David and his successors, -- a
   circumstance which should lay the people of God under an additional
   obligation to present him with their free-will offerings of praise.

   30. Destroy the company of spearmen Some read rebuke, but I approve of
   the distinction which has been noticed by those who are most skilled in
   the Hebrew language, that while the verb gr, gear, has this meaning
   when the letter v beth, is interposed, it signifies without it to
   destroy. The word, chyt, chayath, which I have rendered company, has
   been translated beast, [56] but no such sense can apply to it here.
   David evidently prays in this passage that God would deliver his chosen
   people by destroying their cruel and bloody enemies. In calling these
   the company of the reed or cane, [57] he does not mean to say that they
   are weak, but alludes to the kind of armor which they wore, and which
   were lances or spears. The reed grows in some countries to a tree, or
   at least has all the consistency of wood, and the people are in the
   habit of making darts from it. In the East missile weapons are commonly
   used in war. He compares them for their fierceness to bulls, so I have
   rendered the word 'vyrym, abbirim; for though it may be translated
   strong or stout persons -- the congregation of the strong -- it
   occasionally bears the other meaning; and as David adds, calves of the
   people, [58] it would seem evident that he uses a figure to represent
   the rage and fury of the enemy, and perhaps their strength, which the
   Israelites were wholly unequal to combat except with Divine assistance.
   It is not so easy to discover the meaning of the next clause in the
   verse, treading upon pieces of silver The Hebrew verb rphs, raphas,
   signifies to tread, or literally, (for it, is here in the hithpael
   conjugations) causing themselves to tread; and some consider that the
   allusion is to the arrogance and vain-glorious boasting of the enemy.
   Others attach exactly the opposite sense to the words, holding that
   they denote submission, and that the enemy would bring pieces of silver
   in token of subjection. [59] But how could we suppose that David would
   pray for the destruction of enemies who were already subdued, and
   paying tribute in the character of suppliants? To this it has been said
   in reply, that enemies may retain their animosity in all its force
   within their own breasts, ready to vent itself in rebellion upon the
   first opportunity, although when deprived of arms they cannot display
   it openly, and that this is especially true of the enemies of the
   Church, whose antipathies are virulent, ever breaking forth afresh so
   soon as an occasion offers. But I see no necessity for doing violence
   to the words of the Psalmist, and would take them in their plain
   acceptation, as meaning that the enemy in their pride trampled upon
   pieces of silver. The reference may be to attachments of silver upon
   their sandals, as the Eastern nations were always proverbial for their
   luxury. [60] What immediately follows by no means favors the sense we
   have formerly adverted to, scatter the people who delight in war, where
   he hints that they sought groundless occasions for quarrel and tumult,
   and gratuitously attacked such as were disposed for peace. When we find
   David, after all the victories he had gained, still commending himself
   and his people to the protection of God, it should teach us to abandon
   the hope of ever seeing the Church placed in a state of perfect
   tranquillity in this world, exposed, as it is, to a succession of
   enemies raised up by the malice of Satan, and designed by God for the
   trial and exercise of our patience. In comparing their enemies to the
   beasts here mentioned, and taking notice that they delighted in war, it
   was no doubt his intention to influence the minds of the people of God
   to the contrary dispositions of clemency and mercy, as being that frame
   of spirit in the exercise of which they might expect to receive the
   Divine assistance. The more violently their enemies raged, and the more
   lawless their attempts might prove, they had only the more reason to
   expect the interposition of God, who humbles the proud and the mighty
   ones of this world. Such being the character of God, let us learn from
   this prayer of David to resort to him with confidence when the objects
   at any time of unmerited persecution, and to believe that he is able to
   deliver us at once from all our enemies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] Instead of the company of spearmen, the greater number of modern
   critics consider the wild beast of the reeds as the most correct
   translation; and this is understood by many to represent the Egyptian
   people and government under the emblem of the hippopotamus or
   river-horse, the behemoth of Scripture. This animal -- which is a
   quadruped of enormous size, of prodigious strength, fierce and cruel in
   its disposition, and whose skin is so impenetrable that no arrows can
   pierce it -- shelters and reposes itself among the tall reeds which
   skirt in abundance the banks of the Nile, (Job 40:21.) It is a very
   appropriate emblem of the Egyptian power, in the height of its
   greatness so formidable, and the inveterate enemy of Israel. And that
   the Psalmist here refers to it has been thought the more probable, from
   his mentioning, in the clause immediately following, the bulls and
   calves of the people, these animals having been honored and worshipped
   as deities by that degenerate and superstitious nation. Or, the wild
   beast of the reeds may, as is supposed by others, denote the same power
   under the representation of the crocodile, to which the characteristics
   of the hippopotamus, now specified, are equally applicable. By this
   ferocious and truculent animal Pharaoh king of Egypt is represented in
   Ezekiel 29:3, 5, and 32:2; and in Psalm 74:14. This, it would appear,
   was anciently employed as an emblem of Egypt. On a medal which the
   Emperor Augustine caused to be struck after he had completely reduced
   this powerful kingdom, Egypt is represented by the figure of a
   crocodile bound with a chain to a palm-tree, with the inscription, Nemo
   antea relegavit. Dathe, however, rejects the opinion, that the
   crocodile, and under it the King of Egypt, is pointed at; and observes,
   that David cultivated peace with the King of Egypt, and that, in verse
   31st, the Egyptians are commemorated as worshippers of the true God. He
   supposes that the wild beast of the reeds may be an epithet applied to
   the lion, who is accustomed to haunt places where reeds grow, and that
   under this image the King of Syria may be referred to, with whom David
   carried on lengthened and bloody wars, as is abundantly evident from
   sacred history. Dr Lowth also supposes that the lion is meant, (see his
   Lectures on Sacred Poetry, volume 1, p. 135;) and the same view is
   adopted by Schnurrer, Rosenmuller, and others.

   [57] The original term is qnh, kane; hence the English word cane

   [58] While by the multitude of bulls some understand powerful leaders,
   by the calves of the people they understand the mass of the people,
   undistinguished for rank or power, and particularly the young men. But
   others, as Bishop Horne, suppose, that by the calves of the people is
   meant the idol-calves of the Egyptians, their Apis, Osiris, etc., whom
   they made the objects of their religious worship. Horsley reads, "The
   assembly of those who place their strength in the calves;" that is, as
   he explains it, "The people of Egypt, who worshipped calves, and
   trusted in them as their gods."

   [59] In Bagster's interlinear version, the rendering is, "shall be each
   submitting itself with pieces of silver." Wheatland and Silvester
   translate, "Till each submiss, from hostile acts shall cease,
   And with the tribute-silver sue for peace."

   [60] Various other explanations have been given of the words, mtrphs
   vrtsy-ksph, mithrappes beratsey-kaseph, rendered by Calvin, treading
   with their feet upon pieces of silver, and by which critics have been
   much perplexed. "Berlin translates the words calcantem frusta argenti,'
   which he explains by pavimentum argento tessellatum.' De Rossi explains
   the words thus, Who advance with laminae of silver under their horses'
   hoofs.' Immanuel Ben Solomon, whose Scholia on select passages of the
   Psalms were published by De Rossi, gives the following explanation.
   Dicit [vates scil.] quod Deus disperdit nationes, quae volunt malum
   inferre Israeli, et coetum taurorum, seu reges illustriores, ut reges
   Assyriae et Babylonis, quorum quisque conculcat frusta argentea; i e.,
   incedunt cum lamina aurea sub pedibus suis ob multitudinem divitiarum
   suarum.'" -- Rogers' Book of Psalms, volume 2, p. 223. Dr Geddes'
   version is: "The assemblage of the potent lords of nations,
   Who tread on tiles of silver;" and he supposes that the poet alludes to
   the floors in the palaces of the Oriental kings, which were paved with
   silver. Dr Jubb renders the phrase, "who excite themselves with
   fragments of silver;" and considers the allusion to be to the dancing
   of the Egyptians before their idol-calves, with the tinkling
   instruments called Sistra. That they were accustomed to dance before
   these idols is evident from Exodus 32:6, where we are taught that the
   people of Israel, in imitation of the Egyptian idolatry, rose up to
   shout and dance before the golden calf; for such is the meaning of the
   words, "they rose up to play," as appears from verses 17, 18, and 19.
   And that they used the sistrum in religious feasts, Herodotus informs
   us in the second book of his History. The words, pieces of silver,
   according to Jubb, signify the little loose pieces of metal with which
   the sistrum was hung round, which produced the jingling noise when the
   instrument was played upon. This description fits the Egyptians; and
   that it really belongs to them may be inferred, with some degree of
   probability, from the following verse, where it is said, "Princes shall
   come out of Egypt," as if the subjugation of this nation, imprecated in
   the preceding verse, were here supposed complete. Tucker has here a
   very good remark. "David," says he, "invokes the Messiah to bring down
   the power of Egypt; but in his abhorrence of their idolatry, deigns not
   to designate them except in the most contemptuous terms. He says not,
   Rebuke the assembly of those who worship bulls and calves, and dance
   round altars to the sound of instruments of silver, but he classes the
   people on a par with the idols which they worshipped, -- the assembly
   of bulls and calves, who dance to bits (or pieces) of silver.'" "The
   sistrum was of an oval figure, or a dilated semicircle, in the shape of
   a shoulder-belt, with brass wires across, which played in holes wherein
   they were stopped by their flat heads. The performer played on it by
   shaking the sistrum in cadence, and thereby the brass wires made a
   shrill and loud noise." -- Mant.

   Psalm 68:31-35

   31. Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
   [or, shall hasten to stretch out] her hands unto God. 32. Sing unto
   God, ye kingdoms of the earth: sing praises to the Lord. Selah. 33. To
   him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which were of old,
   [literally the heavens of ancientness;] lo! he shall send forth in his
   voice a mighty voice. 34. Give strength unto God over Israel; his
   excellency and his strength are in the clouds. 35. O God! thou art
   terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel himself shall give
   strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God!


   31. Princes shall come out of Egypt. He resumes the strain of
   thanksgiving, and confirms what he had previously asserted, that kings
   would come and pay tribute unto God. The examples which he brings
   forward are those of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. This sufficiently
   proves that the prediction must be extended to Christ, by whom the
   Egyptians and Ethiopians were brought under the sway of God. The word
   tryph, tarits, translated, shall soon stretch out, might have been
   rendered, shall cause to run. [61] But it seemed necessary to soften
   the harshness of the figure. It is doubtful whether the allusion be to
   the promptness with which they should yield subjection, or whether he
   means that they would stretch out their hands to entreat pardon, this
   being an attitude common to suppliants. According to either
   interpretation, it is their submission which is intended, and it is
   enough to know that David asserts that Ethiopia and Egypt would come
   under the power of God, and not they only, but the most distant parts
   of the world.

   In the next verse he goes farther than before, and calls upon the
   kingdoms of the earth to praise God, language which implies that those
   who had once been distinguished by their hostility to him would be
   ranked amongst his willing worshippers. There must be the knowledge of
   God, as I have remarked elsewhere, before men can celebrate the praises
   of his name; and we have a proof of the calling of the Gentiles, in the
   fact that Moses and the prophets invite them to offer sacrifices of
   praise. That it might not seem a strange and incredible thing to speak
   of the extension of the worship of God from one land, within which it
   had been hitherto confined, to the whole world, David insists upon
   God's rightful dominion over all parts of the earth. He rideth upon the
   heaven of heavens; that is, as we have observed at the beginning of the
   psalm, he has supreme power over all creatures, and governs the
   universe at his will. This truth is one which, even in its general
   application, is well fitted to beget a reverential consideration of the
   majesty of God; but we must not overlook the more particular reason for
   which it is here introduced. Mention having been made of the Gentiles,
   who lay as yet without the pale of the Church, he proves them to be
   embraced in the government of God by virtue of his sovereignty as
   Creator, and intimates that there was nothing wonderful in the fact,
   that he who sits upon the heavens should comprehend the whole
   inhabitants of the earth under his sway. By the heavens of ancient
   times, it is meant to intimate that the whole human family were under
   his power from the very beginning. We have a signal proof of the
   glorious power of God in the fact, that, notwithstanding the immensity
   of the fabric of the heavens, the rapidity of their motion, and the
   conflicting revolutions which take place in them, the most perfect
   subordination and harmony are preserved; and that this fair and
   beautiful order has been uninterruptedly maintained for ages. It is
   apparent then how the ancientness of the heavens may commend to us the
   singular excellency of the handiwork of God. Having touched upon the
   work of creation, he particularises thunder, for this is what he
   intends by a mighty voice, as in Psalm 29:4. There are two
   constructions which we may put upon the words used, either that by his
   voice of command he calls forth the thunders which shake heaven and
   earth with the loudness of their sound, or that he sends forth his
   mighty voice in the thunder. I have already shown, at some length, in
   commenting upon the other passage just quoted, that there is a
   propriety in God's being represented as thundering; for the phenomenon
   is one which, more than any other, impresses an awe upon the spirits of
   men. And the words are introduced with the exclamation lo! or behold!
   the better to arrest our wandering thoughts, or rather to reprehend our
   security.

   34. Give strength unto God over Israel The expression is in allusion to
   the sentence which went before, and in which God was said to send forth
   a strong or mighty voice. Not that, properly speaking, we can give
   anything to Him, but, disposed as we are to withhold that honor which
   is his due, David subjoins to what he had said of his thundering with a
   mighty voice, an injunction that we should, on our part, be ready to
   sound forth his praises. To guard the Gentile nations against those
   false ideas upon religion in which they were accustomed to indulge, he
   brings them back to the doctrine of the Law, in which God had specially
   revealed himself, and intimates that, if they would not lose themselves
   in error, they must advance by necessary steps from the creation and
   government of the world, to that doctrine in which God had condescended
   to make a familiar revelation of himself to men. So much is included
   when God is spoken of here as the God of Israel But he does not satisfy
   himself with enjoining them to celebrate the power of God with praises
   of the voice. He exhorts them to the exercise of faith, for in reality
   we cannot better ascribe strength unto God, than by reposing in his
   protection as all-sufficient. Thus, after having said that his strength
   is in the clouds; [62] he adds, that he is terrible out of his holy
   places, by which is meant, that he exerts a power in his temple which
   is sufficient to confound his enemies. Some understand heaven and earth
   to be the holy places intended, but this does not agree with the
   context, for it is immediately added, that the God of Israel would give
   strength unto his people. It is evident, therefore, that the Psalmist
   speaks of God's protection of his Church. The plural number is used in
   speaking of the sanctuary, here as in other places, because the
   tabernacle was divided into three parts. He points, in short, to the
   ark of the covenant, as that which the believing people of God should
   recognize as a symbol of confidence, remembering the promise, "I will
   dwell in the midst of you," and thus resting with security under the
   wings of the Divine protection, and confidently calling upon his name.
   Any right which Israel might have in distinction from others to trust
   in the guardianship of God, rested entirely upon that covenant of free
   grace by which they had been chosen to be God's peculiar heritage. Let
   it be remembered, however, that God continues to exert in behalf of his
   Church still these terrible displays of his power of which the Psalmist
   speaks.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] As to the time and occasion of the composition of this psalm, the
   majority of interpreters refer it to the translation of the ark from
   the house of Obed-Edom to Mount Zion, and with this every part of it
   would, no doubt, harmonize. But other critics, as Drs Geddes,
   Boothroyd, and Morrison, think (and Calvin's opinion seems to be the
   same) that it was penned after some great victory; probably after
   David's signal victory over the Ammonites and Syrians, when the ark was
   brought back in triumph to Jerusalem, (1 Chronicles 19:10-19.) That the
   ark accompanied the army in those ways we learn from the words of Uriah
   to David, in 2 Samuel 11:11, compared with 2 Samuel 12:31. As every
   thing under that dispensation was typical or prophetical, it is very
   natural to regard the triumphant manner in which the ark ascended the
   holy mountain, as an emblem of the far more triumphant and glorious
   ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ (of whom the ark, and the
   tabernacle, and the temple itself, were all figures) to the highest
   heavens, after he had overcome his own and his people's enemies; and in
   this application the 18th verse of this psalm is quoted by the Apostle
   Paul, (Ephesians 4:8, 9.) This inspired composition, though highly
   sublime and beautiful, is universally acknowledged by critics to be of
   very difficult interpretation. Dr Adam Clarke pronounces it "the most
   difficult psalm in the whole Psalter;" and, after quoting the words of
   Simon de Muis, -- who observes, that "it may not be improperly termed
   the torture of critics, and the reproach of commentators," -- he says,
   "There are customs here referred to, which I do not fully understand:
   there are words whose meaning I cannot, to my own satisfaction,
   ascertain; and allusions which are to me inexplicable. Yet of the
   composition itself I have the highest opinion: -- it is sublime beyond
   all comparison; -- it is constructed with an art truly admirable; -- it
   possesses all the dignity of the sacred language; -- none but David
   could have composed it; and, at this lapse of time, it would require no
   small influence of the Spirit that was upon him to give its true
   interpretations."
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 69

   There is a close resemblance between this psalm and the twenty-second.
   In the opening verses, David complains of the barbarous cruelty of his
   enemies, and of the grievous wrongs which they had inflicted upon him.
   [63] But his mind, he affirms, was not hereby reduced to such a state
   of distress as to prevent him from patiently relying on the protection
   of God, or to discourage him from continuing in the undeviating course
   of a holy and an upright life. He rather testifies that his piety, and
   the courage and activity which he had manifested in maintaining the
   interests of the divine glory, were the cause of the hostility borne to
   him by the generality of men. After having again complained of being
   not less shamefully than cruelly oppressed by his enemies, he invokes
   God to visit them with deserved punishment. In the close, exulting as
   if he had obtained his highest wishes, he engages to yield to God a
   solemn sacrifice of praise.

   To the chief musician upon Shoshannim of David.

   We have already spoken elsewhere of the word Shoshannim. Its proper
   meaning is uncertain and obscure; but the most probable conjecture is,
   that it was the commencement of some song. If, however, any would
   prefer considering it as the name of some musical instrument, I have no
   objections. But the opinion held by some that this psalm was composed
   at the season of spring, when the lilies begin to blossom, is
   altogether unfounded and frivolous. [64] Before proceeding farther, we
   would have you to observe that David wrote this inspired ode not so
   much in his own name, as in the name of the whole Church, of whose Head
   he was an eminent type, as will be more dearly brought out in the
   sequel. This is highly worthy of our notice, that from this
   consideration we may be led to contemplate with the greater attention
   the representation which is here given of the common condition of all
   the people of God. Besides, it is highly probable that David did not
   here comprehend only one kind of persecution, but all the evils which
   he had suffered during the course of many years.

   Psalm 69:1-5

   1. Save me, O God! for the waters have entered in unto my soul. 2. I am
   sunk in deep mire, where there is no footing, [or standing place:] I am
   come into deep waters, and the flood [65] of the water overfloweth me.
   3. I am weary of crying; my throat has become hoarse therewith: my eyes
   have failed with [or in] waiting for my God. 4. They who hate me
   without cause are more in number than the hairs of my head: my lying
   adversaries, who eagerly desire to destroy me, are increased; [66] that
   which I took not by spoil, then [67] I restored it. 5. O God! thou
   knowest my foolishness; and my faults are not hidden from thee.


   1. Save me, O God! for the waters, etc. Under the figure of waters, the
   Psalmist represents his condition as so extremely distressing that it
   brought him even to the brink of despair; and yet we know that, so far
   from being a soft and an effeminate person, he was one who encountered
   and overcame dreadful temptations with extraordinary courage. Whence we
   may infer the bitterness of the distress with which he was at that time
   afflicted. Some understand the word soul as denoting life; [68] but
   this gives a very cold and unsatisfactory meaning. It rather signifies
   the heart. A man when he falls into an abyss of waters, may prevent for
   some time the water from entering his body, by stopping his mouth and
   his nostrils, but at length, from its being impossible for a human
   being to live without respiration, suffocation will compel him to let
   in the waters, and they will penetrate even to the heart. David by this
   metaphor would intimate, not only that the waters had covered and
   overwhelmed him, but also that he had been forced to draw them into his
   body.

   2. I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing place Here he
   compares his afflictions to a deep sink of mire, where there is still
   greater danger; for if a man fixes his feet upon a solid bottom, he may
   raise himself up, there having been many instances in which persons,
   placing their feet on the bottom, have by a sudden spring emerged and
   escaped the peril of the waters; but when a man finds himself once sunk
   in some slough or muddy river, it is all over with him, he has no means
   of saving himself. [69] The Psalmist adduces additional circumstances
   in illustration of his afflicted condition. He declares that he was
   inundated by the flowing of the waters; an expression indicating the
   disorder and confusion which his distresses and persecutions produced.

   3 I am weary of crying David, in seeking and calling upon God, when his
   affairs were in such a confused and desperate condition, exhibited an
   instance of rare and wonderful patience. He complains of having
   continued crying until he was exhausted and became hoarse, and all to
   no purpose. By the word weary, he does not mean that he gave up with
   prayer, as if he had cast from him all love to and delight in that
   exercise upon finding that it proved unavailing as a means of
   deliverance. He rather describes his untiring perseverance; and the
   same idea is expressed by his hoarse throat and failing eyes. [70] He
   certainly did not cry out before men from mere affectation, nor was
   this hoarseness contracted in the course of one day. We perceive, then,
   that although his bodily senses failed him, the vigor of his faith was
   by no means extinguished. When we reflect that David has spoken, as it
   were, out of the mouth of Christ, and, as it were, out of the mouth of
   all true saints who are the members of Christ, we ought not to think
   that any strange thing happens to us, if at any time we are so
   overwhelmed with death, as to be unable to discern the slightest hope
   of life. Yea, rather let us learn betimes, while God spares us, to
   meditate on this truth, and derive the aid which it is fitted to impart
   under calamity, that even in the most profound depths of adversity
   faith may hold us up, and, what is more, may elevate us to God; there
   being, as Paul testifies, (Romans 8:39) no height nor depth which can
   separate us from the infinite love of Him who swallows up all depths,
   yea, even hell itself.

   4. They who hate me without cause are more in number than the hairs of
   my head The Psalmist now expresses without figure what he had said
   under the metaphors of the mire and of the impetuous rushing of the
   waters. Persecuted as he was by so great a multitude of enemies, he had
   too good reason to be afraid of death in innumerable ways. Nor is his
   language hyperbolical, when he represents his enemies as more in number
   than the hairs of his head, since he was mortally hated and detested by
   the whole kingdom, it being the universal belief that he was a base and
   wicked traitor to his country. Farther, we know from the sacred history
   how numerous and powerful the armies were which Saul sent forth to
   pursue him. He expresses the mortal hatred which they bore to him, when
   he tells us that they were intently set upon his destruction, being
   eagerly desirous to have him cut off by a violent death; and yet he
   avows that he had done nothing to merit such unrelenting persecution.
   The Hebrew word chnm, chinnam, which we have rendered, without cause,
   and which some translate, for nothing, intimates that they were
   impelled by a strong desire to do him injury, although he had not done
   them even the slightest wrong, nor given them the smallest provocation
   by ill usage of any kind. For this reason he applies to his enemies the
   appellation sqr, sheker, that is, liars, because they had no just
   ground to make war upon him, although they pretended the contrary. Let
   us, therefore, after his example, if at any time we are subjected to
   persecution, study to have the support arising from the testimony of a
   good conscience, and to be able freely to protest before God, that the
   hatred which our enemies cherish against us is altogether causeless.
   This implies a self-control to which it is very difficult for a man to
   inure himself; but the more difficult it is, the more strenuous ought
   to be his efforts to attain it. It is mere effeminacy to regard it as
   an intolerable evil to be unrighteously afflicted; and the folly of
   this is very happily exposed by that noble answer of Socrates to his
   wife, who, having one day lamented, in prison, that he was condemned
   wrongfully, received from him this reply, "What then -- would you
   rather that I should have suffered death for my offenses?" Farther,
   David adds, that he not only had to suffer the wrongs of violence, but
   had also to bear much reviling and contumely, as if he had been
   convicted of many crimes; a trial which, to an ingenuous mind, is more
   bitter and hard to bear than a hundred deaths. Many are to be found
   resolutely prepared to encounter death, who are by no means prepared to
   exhibit equal fortitude in the endurance of shame. Farther, David was
   not only despoiled of his goods by the violence of robbers, but he had
   been also mangled in his person, as if he had been a thief and a
   robber: That which I took not by spoil, then I restored it [71] When
   his enemies thus plundered and maltreated him, they doubtless boasted
   that they were acting as the judges of a perverse and wicked man; and
   we know that they were held in honorable estimation as judges. Let us
   therefore learn from this example to prepare ourselves not only to bear
   patiently all losses and troubles, yea, even death itself; but also
   shame and reproach, if at any time we are loaded with unfounded
   accusations. Christ himself, the fountain of all righteousness and
   holiness, was not exempted from foul calumny, why then should we be
   dismayed when we meet with a similar trial? It may well fortify our
   minds against it when we consider, that to persevere steadfastly in the
   practice of righteousness, although such is the reward which we receive
   from the world, is the genuine test of our integrity.

   5. O God! thou knowest my foolishness Augustine has labored to little
   purpose to show in what way these words are applicable to Christ; and
   at length he transfers to his members that which could not properly be
   said of the Head. [72] David here uses the language of irony; and by
   this mode of expressing himself he meant to intimate, that, overwhelmed
   with the unrighteous judgments of men, he betakes himself to God, and
   implores him to appear as the defender of his cause. This is much more
   emphatic than if he had affirmed plainly, and without figure, that his
   integrity was known to God. In this way he administers a sharp rebuke
   to his enemies, and as it were looks down with a noble contempt upon
   the calumnious speeches which they uttered against him; as Jeremiah
   does when he says,

   "O Lord! thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived."
   (Psalm 20:7)

   Some ignorant people put a violent construction on these words of
   Jeremiah, as if they implied that he was actually deceived; whereas he
   is rather to be understood as deriding with bitter sarcasm his
   calumniators, who, in speaking evil of him, were chargeable with
   reproaching and blaspheming God himself. David in like manner, in the
   passage before us, as a means of preserving himself from succumbing
   under the perverse judgments of men, appeals to God as the judge of his
   cause; and possessing as he did the approving testimony of a good
   conscience, he regards in a great measure with indifference the unjust
   estimate which men might form of his character. It were indeed
   desirable that our integrity should also be acknowledged and approved
   of by men, and that not so much on our own account as for the
   edification of our brethren. But if, after we have done all in our
   power to make men form a favorable opinion respecting us, they
   misconstruct and pervert every good word which we utter, and every good
   action which we perform, we ought to maintain such greatness of mind as
   boldly to despise the world and all false accusers, resting contented
   with the judgment of God and with that alone; for those who are over
   anxious about maintaining their good name cannot but often experience
   fainting of heart. Let us be always ready to satisfy men; but if they
   refuse to listen to what we have to say in self-vindication, let us
   proceed in our course through evil report as well as good report,
   following the example of Paul where he fearlessly appeals to the
   judgment of God,

   "who will bring to light the hidden things of dark,"
   (1 Corinthians 4:5)

   [71] "There is an apparent impropriety in the language of this verse,
   though the sense is perfectly clear. It is a proverbial expression, to
   mark the injustice and extortion of the enemies that are referred to,
   who compelled the speaker, without any right, to yield up his goods to
   persons to whom he was not indebted." -- Walford. Horsley observes,
   that this last clause is a proverbial expression, the meaning of which
   is, "I have been accountable for the crimes of others." Dr Adam Clarke
   also remarks, that this is a sort of proverbial expression like these:
   "Those who suffered the wrong pay the costs" -- "Kings sin and the
   people are punished." This pre-eminently applies to Christ, who was
   perfectly holy, but who, by bearing the punishment due to the guilt of
   man, made satisfaction to Divine justice for sins which he never
   committed, and restored those blessings which he never took away.

   [72] According to Augustine, the Messiah, when he says "my foolishness"
   and "my iniquities," speaks of the sins of men which were imputed to
   him, and for which he suffered and died under the curse of the law,
   which treated him as if he had been a sinner, in consequence of the
   sins thus imputed to him. A similar interpretation is given by Bishops
   Horsley and Horne, as well as many others. "The Messiah," says the
   first of these critics, "here, as in many places, may speak of the
   follies and crimes of men, for which he had made himself answerable as
   his own." Admitting, as we are disposed to do, although Calvin takes an
   opposite view, that the passage is applicable to Christ, it may be
   doubted whether this is the correct interpretation. The sins of those
   for whom Christ died, by being imputed to him, no doubt became his in
   the eye of the law, in such a sense as to make him answerable for them.
   But the Scriptures, be it observed, while they speak of him as "wounded
   for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities," and as
   "bearing our sins in his own body on the tree," as if afraid to use any
   forms of expression which would even seem to derogate from his
   immaculate purity, never speak of the sins of those for whom he died as
   his own sins. What Horsley adds, as an additional explanation, is very
   unguarded. "Perhaps," says he, "He who, although he was without sin,
   was yet tempted in all points like up to us, might, in his humility,
   speak of the incitement of the passions in his own mind as weakness and
   fault, making confession of it before the Father." Nothing, doubtless,
   was farther from the mind of the prelate than to teach any thing
   inconsistent with the perfect holiness of the Son of God; and he
   expressly warns that "he was without sin;" but the language which he
   employs is scarcely consistent with this position, and it can convey no
   idea on the subject except an erroneous one. "The prince of this world
   cometh," said Jesus to his disciples, "and hath nothing in me" -- hath
   nothing in me, that is, to use the words of Dr Doddridge, "no guilt of
   mine to give him power over me; nor any inward corruption, to take part
   with his temptations." The explanation of the text, which appears to be
   the most natural and consistent, is that which considers the Savior as
   solemnly appealing to the Father in vindication of his innocence. His
   enemies falsely charged him with crimes, and made these charges the
   ground of their cruel and malignant proceedings against him. The Divine
   Sufferer, therefore, with confidence appeals to God, saying, Thou, who
   art the omniscient and all-righteous Judge, knowest that I am innocent
   of the crimes laid to my charge, and I invoke thee to plead my cause.
   This interpretation, which is adopted by many eminent critics, as Dr
   Boothroyd, Dr Morrison, Walford, and others, is strongly supported by
   the context. The preceding verse contains strong assertions of his
   innocence; and it was very natural to accompany these with an appeal
   from the falsehood and calumny of men, to the all-seeing and righteous
   Judge of the universe.

   Psalm 69:6-9

   6. O Jehovah, Lord of Hosts! let not them that wait for thee be ashamed
   in me: let not them who seek thee be put to shame in me, O God of
   Israel! 7. For on thy account I have suffered reproach: shame hath
   covered my face. 8. I have been a stranger to my brethren, and am
   become an alien to the children of my mother. [73] 9. For the zeal of
   thy house hath eaten me up; and the reproach of them that reproached
   thee are fallen upon me.


   6 O Jehovah, Lord of Hosts! let not them that wait for thee be ashamed
   in me. David declares that he is set forth as an example from which all
   the people of God may derive matter either of hope or despair. Although
   he was held in detestation and execrated by the great body of the
   people, there yet remained a few who were ready to bear just and
   impartial testimony to his innocence; knowing as they did that he was
   unrighteously afflicted by his persecutors, that he constantly reposed
   on the grace and goodness of God, and that no temptations could
   discourage or prevent him from continuing steadfast in the practice of
   true godliness. But when they observed the distresses and calamities to
   which he was notwithstanding subjected, the only conclusion to which
   they were able to arrive was, that all the pains and labor which he had
   taken in devoutly serving God were entirely thrown away. As all the
   instances in which God extends his succor to his servants are so many
   seals, by which he confirms and gives us assurance of his goodness and
   grace towards us, the faithful must have been exceedingly discouraged
   had David been forsaken in the extremity of his distress. The danger of
   their being thus discouraged he now lays before God; not that God has
   ever need of being put in mind of any thing, but because he allows us
   to deal familiarly with him at the throne of grace. The word wait is
   properly to be understood of hope, and the expression to seek God, of
   prayer. The connecting of the two together teaches us the profitable
   lesson, that faith is not all inactive principle, since it is the means
   of stirring us up to seek God.

   7 For on thy account I have suffered reproach He now expresses more
   distinctly what he had stated ironically in the fifth verse, where he
   asserts that his faults were not hidden from God. Nay, he proceeds
   farther, declaring not only that the evil treatment which he met with
   from his enemies was unjust and altogether unmerited, but also that his
   cause was really God's cause, since whatever he had undertaken and
   engaged in was expressly in obedience to the command of God. Saul no
   doubt had other reasons, or at least other pretences, for persecuting
   David; but as the hatred which he entertained against him most
   unquestionably proceeded from God's having called and anointed him to
   be king, David here justly protests that it was not for any wickedness
   which he had committed, but because he had obeyed God, that men in
   general disapproved of and rashly condemned him. It is a source of
   great consolation to true believers when they can protest that they
   have the warrant and call of God for whatever they undertake or engage
   in. If we are hated by the world for making a public confession of the
   faith, a thing which we are to expect, it being evident from
   observation that the wicked ordinarily are never more fierce than when
   they assault the truth of God and the true religion, we have ground to
   entertain double confidence. [74] We also learn from this passage how
   monstrous is the malice of men, who convert into a ground for reproach
   and reprehension the zeal for the Divine glory by which true believers
   are animated. [75] But it is well for us that God not only wipes away
   the reproaches with which the wicked load us, but also so ennobles
   them, that they surpass all the honors and triumphs of the world. The
   Psalmist farther aggravates his complaint by the additional
   circumstance, that he was cruelly cast off by his own relations and
   friends; from which we are taught, that when by our devotedness to the
   cause of religion we cannot avoid exciting the displeasure of our
   brethren against us, it is our duty simply to follow God, and not to
   confer with flesh and blood.

   9 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up [76] David's enemies, no
   doubt, professed that nothing was farther from their mind than to touch
   the sacred name of God; but he reproves their hypocritical pretences,
   and affirms that he is fighting in God's quarrel. The manner in which
   he did this, he shows, was by the zeal for the Church of God with which
   his soul was inflamed. He not only assigns the cause of the evil
   treatment which he received -- his zeal for the house of God -- but
   also declares that whatever evil treatment he was undeservedly made the
   object of, yet, as it were, forgetting himself, he burned with a holy
   zeal to maintain the Church, and at the same time the glory of God,
   with which it is inseparably connected. To make this the more obvious,
   let it be observed, that although all boast in words of allowing to God
   the glory which belongs to him; yet when the law, the rule of virtuous
   and holy living, presents its claims to them, men only mock him, and
   not only so, but they furiously rush against him by the opposition
   which they make to his Word. They do this as if he willed to be honored
   and served merely with the breath of the lip, and had not rather
   erected a throne among men, from which to govern them by laws. David,
   therefore, here places the Church in the room of God; not that it was
   his intention to transfer to the Church what is proper to God, but to
   show the vanity of the pretensions which men make of being the people
   of God, when they shake themselves loose from the control of God's holy
   law, of which the Church is the faithful guardian. Besides, David had
   to deal with a class of men who, although a hypocritical and bastard
   race, professed to be the people of God; for all who adhered to Saul
   boasted of having a place in the Church, and stigmatised David as an
   apostate or a rotten member. With this unworthy treatment David was so
   far from being discouraged, that he willingly sustained all assaults
   for the defense of the true Church. He declares that he is unmoved by
   all the wrongs and revilings which he personally suffered at the hands
   of his enemies. Laying aside all concern about himself, he is
   disquieted and distressed only for the oppressed condition of the
   Church, or rather burns with anguish, and is consumed with the
   vehemence of his grief.

   The second clause of the verse is to the same effect, denoting that he
   has nothing separate from God. Some explain it in a different sense,
   understanding it to mean that the wicked and proud, with the view of
   making an assault upon David, directed their fury and violence against
   God himself, and in this way indirectly pierced the heart of this holy
   man with their blasphemies, knowing as they did that nothing would be
   more grievous to him to bear than this. But this interpretation is too
   forced. Equally forced is that of those who consider David as
   intimating that he did not less prostrate himself in humble
   supplication at the mercy-seat whenever he heard the name of God torn
   by reproaches and blasphemy, than if he himself had been guilty of
   treason against the Divine Majesty. I therefore adhere to the opinion
   which I have already expressed, That David forgot what concerned
   himself, and that all the grief which he felt proceeded from the holy
   zeal with which he burned when he saw the sacred name of God insulted
   and outraged with horrible blasphemies. By this example we are taught,
   that whereas we are naturally so tender and delicate as to be unable to
   bear ignominy and reproach, we must endeavor to get quit of this
   unhappy state of mind, and ought rather to be grieved and agonised with
   the reproaches which are poured forth against God. On account of these,
   it becomes us to feel deep indignation, and even to give expression to
   this in strong language; but we ought to bear the wrongs and reproaches
   which we personally suffer without complaining. Until we have learned
   to set very little value upon our own reputation, we will never be
   inflamed with true zeal in contending for the preservation and
   advancement of the interests of the Divine glory. Besides, as David
   speaks in the name of the whole Church, whatever he says concerning
   himself behoved to be fulfilled in the supreme Head. It is, therefore,
   not surprising to find the Evangelists applying this passage to Christ,
   (John 2:17.) In like manner, Paul, in Romans 15:3, 5, 6, exhorting the
   faithful to imitate Christ, applies the second member to them all, and
   there also teaches us that the doctrine contained in it is very
   comprehensive, requiring them to devote themselves wholly to the
   advancement of the Divine glory, to endeavor in all their words and
   actions to preserve it unimpaired, and to be carefully on their guard
   that it may not be obscured by any fault of theirs. Since Christ, in
   whom there shines forth all the majesty of Deity, did not hesitate to
   expose himself to every species of reproach for the maintenance of his
   Father's glory, how base and shameful will it be for us to shrink from
   a similar lot.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [73] In the East, where polygamy prevails, those who are children of
   the same father, but by different mothers, scarcely look upon each
   other as brothers and sisters at all, but as strangers or enemies;
   while those who are children of the same mother regard each other with
   peculiarly strong affection. Hence said Gibeon to Zebah and Zalmunna,
   who had put to death his brethren, "They were my brethren, even the
   sons of my mother; as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
   would not slay you," (Judges 8:19.) It therefore greatly aggravated the
   affliction of David that he had "become an alien to the children of his
   mother," from whom he might have expected affection and sympathy,
   however much he might have been disregarded by his brethren, who were
   the children of his father's other wives. See [3]volume 2, p. 277, note
   3.

   [74] That is, the confidence arising from the reflection that we are,
   in the first place, suffering unjustly; and, secondly, that we are
   suffering in the cause of God.

   Parkhurst) is, in the Hebrew Bible, generally applied to the fervent or
   ardent affections of the human frame, the effects of which are well
   known to be even like those of fire, corroding and consuming; and,
   accordingly, the poets, both ancient and modern, abound with
   descriptions of these ardent and consuming affections, taken from fire
   and its effects. (See on qn'.)" -- Mant

   Psalm 69:10-13

   10. And I wept, my soul fasted; and that was laid to me as a reproach.
   11. I also made sackcloth my clothing: and I became a proverb to them.
   12. They who sit in the gate defame me: and I am the song of those who
   drink intoxicating liquor. 13. But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O
   Jehovah! in a time of thy favor, [or good-will,] O God: answer me in
   the multitude of thy mercy, in the truth of thy salvation.


   10. And I wept, my soul fasted David here proves, by the signs or
   effects, that his efforts to promote the Divine glory proceeded from a
   pure and well-regulated zeal, inasmuch as he was not impelled or
   inflamed by the impetuosity of the flesh, but rather humbly abased
   himself before God, choosing him to be the witness of his sorrow. By
   this he shows the more evidently the incorrigible perversity of his
   enemies. It frequently happens, that those who set themselves boldly
   for the vindication of the glory of God, provoke and exasperate the
   wicked to a higher pitch by opposing them contentiously and without
   moderation. But David's zeal was so tempered that it ought to have
   softened even the hardness of steel. By this circumstance he, however,
   intended to show that he was oppressed with such violence by the
   frowardness of his enemies, that he dared not even open his mouth to
   speak a single word in defense of the cause of God, and no other means
   were left him of defending it but tears and mourning. He was deprived,
   as we know, of the liberty of giving utterance to the sentiments of his
   heart, or rather his words, as being those of a condemned person, would
   have been repelled with cruel reproaches. It was a proof of the greater
   constancy when in such circumstances he continued to burn with a zeal
   as unabated as ever, and persevered in the voluntary sorrow which he
   had engaged to exercise with the view of maintaining the honor and
   glory of God. He accordingly declares, that he wept and that his soul
   fasted, and that he was clothed with sackcloth; which were the tokens
   of mourning among the Jews. But his enemies turned all these things
   into mockery and jesting; [77] from which it is manifest that they were
   carried away with the fury of demons. It is of importance for us to be
   fortified with such an example, that in the present day we may not be
   discouraged when we meet with the same perversity by which the enemies
   of the Gospel prove themselves to be rather devils than men. We must,
   however, beware of pouring oil upon the fire which is already burning
   too fiercely, and should rather imitate David and Lot, who, although
   they had not liberty to rebuke the wicked, were yet deeply grieved in
   their hearts. And even when the wicked are constrained to hear us,
   mildness and humility will be a powerful means, or rather will be the
   best seasoning, for tempering holy zeal. Those who conceive of David as
   intimating that he resigned himself to suffer punishment in the room or
   stead of his enemies, attempt to confirm their opinion from his having
   clothed himself in sackcloth. But I take it more simply as meaning,
   that when he saw things in such a state of confusion, he voluntarily
   engaged in this sorrowful exercise to testify that nothing was more
   grievous to him than to witness the sacred name of God exposed to
   contumely.

   12. They who sit in the gate defame me Had David been molested only by
   vulgar buffoons and the refuse of the people, it would have been more
   easily endured; for it is not surprising that mean persons, who have no
   regard to what is becoming and honorable, degrade themselves by
   indulging in defamation without shame. But when the very judges,
   forgetful of what is demanded by the dignity of their office, abandon
   themselves to the same audacious conduct, the iniquity and baseness of
   it is greatly aggravated. Accordingly, David expressly complains that
   he was made a by-word and a proverb by those in the highest ranks of
   life. The opinion of some who, by the expression, they who sit in the
   gate, understand the whole people, [78] is both frigid and inconsistent
   with the words of the text; for although men of every rank and
   condition assembled at the gates, yet none but the judges and
   counsellors sat there. [79] This is confirmed by the second clause of
   the verse; for by those who drink strong drink, [80] is doubtless meant
   the rulers who were elevated by their wealth and dignity. It was,
   indeed, very cruel treatment, that this holy man was not only harassed
   by the lower classes of the people, but that the very persons who
   presided in the cause of justice, and the dignitaries of the Church,
   were in this ringleaders to others. As the same thing happens in our
   own day, it is not without cause that the Holy Spirit has set this
   example before our eyes. In the Papacy we find that the higher a man is
   exalted in honor, he is proportionally the more violent and outrageous
   in his opposition to the Gospel and its ministers, that he may exhibit
   himself a more valiant defender of the Catholic faith. Yea, this is a
   malady with which almost all kings and princes are smitten; which
   arises from their not regarding true dignity and excellence as
   consisting in virtue, and from their thinking that they are entitled to
   act without restraint as they please. And what is the estimation in
   which they hold the faithful servants of Christ? It is a fact which
   cannot be denied, that one of the principal things about which they are
   concerned is, to scoff at and defame them, not only at their tables,
   but also on their thrones, in order, if possible, to shame them into a
   renunciation of their faith. In general, also, they sneer at all the
   people of God, and enjoy themselves in descanting upon their
   simplicity, as if they were fools in wearying and wasting themselves in
   the service of God.

   13. But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Jehovah! It was a sign of
   uncommon virtue in David, that even this hard treatment could not shake
   his mind, and sink him into despondency. He informs us of the means by
   which he fortified himself against that terrible stumbling-block. When
   the wicked directed against him their witty and scoffing remarks, as if
   engines of war, to overthrow his faith, the means to which he had
   recourse for repelling all their assaults was pouring out his heart in
   prayer to God. He was constrained to keep silence before men, and,
   being thus driven out from the world, he betook himself to God. In like
   manner, although the faithful in the present day may be unable to make
   any impression upon the wicked, yet they will ultimately triumph,
   provided they retire from the world, and go directly to God to present
   their prayers before him. The meaning, in short, is, that David, having
   tried every means in his power, and finding that his labor was to no
   purpose, left off dealing with men, and dealt with God only. What
   follows, a time of thy favor, O God! is explained otherwise by many
   interpreters, who read the two clauses of the verse in one sentence,
   thus: But as for me, I prayed to God in a time of his favor;
   corresponding to that passage in Isaiah 55:6, "Call ye upon him while
   he is near." Others resolve it thus: I prayed that the time of favor
   might come, and that God would begin to be merciful to me. But David is
   rather speaking of the consolation which he then received by reflecting
   with himself, that although it was now a time of trouble with him, and
   although his prayers seemed to be altogether unavailing, yet God's
   favor would have its turn also. Thus the Prophet Habakkuk says,

   "I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will
   watch to see what he will say unto me." (Habakkuk 2:1)

   In like manner, Isaiah says,

   "I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of
   Jacob;" (Isaiah 8:17)

   and Jeremiah 14:22,) "We will wait upon thee." The only means by which,
   in our affliction, we can obtain the victory, is by our having hope
   shining in us in the midst of darkness, and by our having the
   sustaining influence which arises from waiting for the favor of God.
   After David has thus fortified himself for continued perseverance in
   the attitude of waiting, he immediately adds, Answer me in the
   multitude of thy goodness; and to goodness he joins the truth of
   salvation, [81] intimating that God's mercy is proved by indubitable
   effect when he succours his servants who are reduced to the very depths
   of despair. What prompted him to present this prayer was, the full
   persuasion which he had, that the darkness in which he was now involved
   would in due time be dispelled, and that a serene and unclouded season
   of God's favor would succeed; a persuasion which arose from his
   recalling all his thoughts to God, lest he should faint by reason of
   the harassing treatment which he met with from the wicked.

   Psalm 69:14-18

   14. Deliver me from the mire, that I may not sink: let me be delivered
   from my adversaries, and from the deep waters. 15. Let not the flood of
   waters overflow me; and let not the deep swallow me up; and let not the
   pit [82] close its mouth upon me. 16. Answer me, O Jehovah! for thy
   mercy [83] is good: in the multitude of thy compassions [84] look upon
   me. 17. And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
   hasten! answer me! 18. Draw near to my soul, redeem it; deliver me, on
   account of my enemies.


   14. Deliver me from the mire, that I may not sink. The Psalmist repeats
   the same similitude which he had used before, but in a different
   manner. He had previously said that he was sunk in the mire, and now he
   prays that he may not sink in it. In short, he now prays that those
   things may not now befall him which he had formerly complained of as
   having befallen him. But it is very easy to reconcile this diversity of
   statement; for in the opening of the psalm he spake according to his
   actual feeling and experience; but now, looking to the issue, although
   living in the midst of death, he cherishes the hope of deliverance.
   This is expressed still more clearly in the last clause of the 15th
   verse, where he prays, Let not the pit close its mouth upon me; which
   is as if he had said, Let not the great multitude and weight of my
   afflictions overwhelm me, and let not sorrow swallow me up.

   16. Answer me, O Jehovah! for thy mercy is good. The appeal which he
   here makes to the mercy and compassion of God is an evidence of the
   distressed condition into which he was brought. There can be no doubt
   that he sustained a dreadful conflict, when he had recourse to these as
   the only means of his safety. It is a very difficult matter to believe
   that God is merciful to us when he is angry with us, and that he is
   near us when he has withdrawn himself from us. David, aware of this,
   brings to his view a subject which he may oppose to this distrust, and
   by pleading for the exercise of the mercy and great compassions of God
   towards him, shows, that the only consideration which inspired him with
   hope was the benignant and merciful character of God. When he says, a
   little after, Look upon me, it is a prayer that God would make it
   manifest in very deed that he had heard him by granting him succor. In
   the following verse he utters a similar prayer. And by repeating so
   often the same things, he declares both the bitterness of his grief and
   the ardor of his desires. When he beseeches God not to hide his face,
   it is not from any apprehension which he entertained of being rejected,
   but because those who are oppressed with calamities cannot avoid being
   agitated and distracted with mental disquietude. But as God, in a
   peculiar manner, invites his servants to him, David avows that he is
   one of their number. In thus speaking, as I have already shown, and
   will afterwards have occasion to state at greater length, he does not
   boast of services on account of which he could prefer any claim to a
   divine reward, but rather depends on the gratuitous election of God;
   although, at the same time, he is to be understood as adducing the
   service which he had faithfully yielded to God by whom he was called,
   as an evidence of his godliness.

   18. Draw near to my soul, redeem it. David was doubtless fully
   persuaded by faith that God was near him; but as we are accustomed to
   measure the presence or absence of God by the effects, David here
   tacitly complains, judging according to the flesh, that he is far from
   him. By the expression, Draw near, he means, that in so far as could be
   gathered from his actual condition, God appeared to have no regard to
   his welfare. Again, by calling upon God to draw near to his life, which
   he seemed to have forsaken, he exhibits a striking proof of the
   strength of his faith. The more cruelly he is molested by the wicked
   and proud, the more does he trust that God will appear to deliver him.
   As has been elsewhere observed, it is always to be held as an undoubted
   truth, that since "God resisteth the proud" (James 4:6,) he must at
   length repress the insolence and pride of those who obstinately resist
   him, although he may seem to connive at them for a time.

   Psalm 69:19-21

   19. Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my ignominy: all my
   adversaries are before thee. 20. Reproach hath broken my heart, and I
   am afflicted: and I looked for one to take pity upon me, but there was
   none; and for comforters, but I found none. 21. And they put gall into
   my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.


   19 Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion. This is a confirmation
   of the preceding sentence. Whence is it that the greater part of men
   become dispirited when they see the wicked outrageously rushing upon
   them, and their wickedness, like a water-flood, carrying all before it,
   but because they think that heaven is so obscured and overcast with
   clouds as to prevent God from beholding what is done upon the earth? It
   becomes us, therefore, in this matter, to call to our remembrance the
   doctrine of a Divine Providence, that contemplating it we may be
   assured beyond all doubt, that God will appear for our succor in due
   season; for he cannot, on the one hand, shut his eyes to our miseries,
   and it is impossible for him, on the other, to allow the license which
   the wicked take in doing evil to pass with impunity, without denying
   himself. David, therefore, takes comfort from the consideration that
   God is the witness of his grief, fear, sorrows, and cares; nothing
   being hidden from the eye of Him who is the judge and governor of the
   world. Nor is it a vain repetition when he speaks so frequently of his
   reproach and shame. As he was subjected to such dreadful assaults of
   temptations as might have made the stoutest heart to tremble, it was
   indispensably necessary for his own defense to oppose to them a strong
   barrier for resistance. Nothing is more bitter to men of an ingenuous
   and noble spirit than reproach; but when this is repeated, or rather
   when shame and reproach are heaped upon us, how needful is it then for
   us to possess more than ordinary strength, that we may not thereby be
   overwhelmed? for when succor is delayed, our patience is very apt to
   give way, and despair very easily creeps in upon us. This shame and
   reproach may very properly be referred both to the outward appearance
   and to the actual feelings of the mind. It is well known that he was
   everywhere held in open derision; and the mockeries which he
   experienced could not but strike into him both shame and sorrow. For
   the same reason he subjoins that his enemies are before God, or known
   to him; as if he had said, Lord, thou knowest how, like a poor sheep, I
   am surrounded by thousands of wolves.

   20. Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am afflicted. He expresses
   more distinctly not only that he was confounded, or ashamed at the sad
   aspect which he presented of having been deserted, but that he was well
   nigh overwhelmed with sorrow by lying so long under reproach and shame.
   Whence it is evident that he did not overcome this sorrow without a
   struggle; and that the reason why he so firmly withstood the waves of
   temptations was, not because they did not reach his heart, but because,
   being sorely smitten, he made resistance with a corresponding degree of
   intrepidity. He states, as an additional aggravation of his distress,
   that every office of humanity was withheld from him: that there was
   nobody who had compassion upon him, or to whom he could disburden his
   griefs. Some take the word nvd, nud, for to tell or recount; and
   undoubtedly when we pour out our complaints to our friends, it affords
   some alleviation to our distress. Thus he employs as an argument for
   obtaining mercy from God, the consideration that he was deprived of all
   aid and comfort from his fellow-men.

   21. And they put gall into my meat. Here he again repeats that his
   enemies carry their cruelty towards him to the utmost extent in their
   power. He speaks metaphorically when he describes them as mingling gall
   or poison with his meat, [85] and vinegar with his drink; even as it is
   said in Jeremiah,

   "Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood,
   and give them water of gall to drink." (Jeremiah 9:15)

   But still the Apostle John justly declares that this Scripture was
   fulfilled when the soldiers gave Christ vinegar to drink upon the
   cross, (John 19:28-30;) for it was requisite that whatever cruelty the
   reprobate exercise towards the members of Christ, should by a visible
   sign be represented in Christ himself. We have stated on the same
   principle, in our [4]remarks upon Psalm 22:18, that when the soldiers
   parted the garments of Christ among them, that verse was appropriately
   quoted, "They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
   they cast lots;" although David's object was to express by figurative
   language that he was robbed, and that all his goods were violently
   taken from him, and made a prey of by his enemies. The natural sense
   must, however, be retained; which is, that the holy prophet had no
   relief afforded him; and that he was in a condition similar to that of
   a man who, already too much afflicted, found, as an additional
   aggravation of his distress, that his meat was poisoned, and his drink
   rendered nauseous by the bitter ingredients with which it had been
   mingled.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] The word r's, rosh, here denominated gall, is thought by Celsius,
   Michaelis, Boothroyd, and others, to be hemlock According to Dr Adam
   Clarke and Williams, it refers to bitters in general, and particularly
   those of a deleterious nature. Bochart, from a comparison of this
   passage with John 19:29, thinks that r's, rosh, is the same herb as the
   Evangelist calls hussopos, "hyssop;" a species of which growing in
   Judea, he proves from Isaac Ben Orman, an Arabian writer, to be so
   bitter, as not to be eatable. Theophylact expressly tells us that the
   hyssop was added as being deleterious or poisonous; and Nonnus'
   paraphrase is, "one gave the deadly acid mixed with hyssop." See
   Parkhurst on r's. The word occurs in Deuteronomy 29:18; 32:33; and is,
   in the latter place, rendered poison In Hosea 10:4, it is rendered
   hemlock; and in Amos 6:12, it is put in apposition with a word there
   translated hemlock, although the same word is also rendered wormwood
   Vinegar, we conceive, here means sour wine, such as was given to slaves
   or prisoners in the East. Persons in better circumstances used lemons
   or pomegranates to give their drink a grateful acidity. It was
   therefore a great insult offered to a royal personage to give him in
   his thirst the refreshment of a slave or of a wretched prisoner; and
   David employs this figure to express the insults which were offered to
   him by his enemies. See Harmer's Observations, volume 2, pp. 158, 159.

   Psalm 69:22-29

   22. Let [86] their table before them be for a snare; and their
   prosperity [87] [or things for peace] for a net. 23. Let their eyes be
   darkened, that they may not see; and make their loins continually to
   tremble. 24. Pour out thy wrath upon them; and let thy hot displeasure
   seize them. 25. Let their habitation be desolate; let none dwell in
   their tent; 26. For they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten;
   and they have added to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded,
   [literally of thy wounded ones.] 27. Add iniquity to their iniquity;
   and let them not enter into thy righteousness. 28. Let them be blotted
   out from the book of the living; and let them not be written among the
   righteous. 29. As for me, I am poor and sorrowful; thy salutation shall
   exalt me.


   22. Let their table before them be for a snare. Here we have a series
   of dire imprecations, with respect to which we must bear in mind, what
   we have elsewhere observed, that David did not allow himself recklessly
   to pour out his wrath, even as the greater part of men, when they feel
   themselves wronged, intemperately give way to their own passion; but,
   being under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, he was kept from going
   beyond the bounds of duty, [88] and simply called upon God to exercise
   just judgment against the reprobate. Farther, it was not on his own
   account that he pleaded in this manner; but it was a holy zeal for the
   divine glory which impelled him to summon the wicked to God's
   judgment-seat. It was also owing to this: that he was not carried away
   by violence of passion, like those who are actuated by a desire of
   taking revenge. Since, then, the Spirit of wisdom, uprightness, and
   moderation, put these imprecations into the mouth of David, his example
   cannot justly be pleaded in self-vindication by those who pour forth
   their wrath and spite upon every one that comes in their way, or who
   are carried away by a foolish impatience to take revenge; never
   allowing themselves to reflect for a moment what good purpose this can
   serve, nor making any efforts to keep their passion within due bounds.
   We need wisdom by which to distinguish between those who are wholly
   reprobate and those of whose amendment there is still some hope; we
   have also need of uprightness, that none may devote himself exclusively
   to his own private interests; and of moderation too, to dispose our
   minds to calm endurance. It being evident, then, that David was
   distinguished by these three qualities, whoever would follow him
   aright, must not allow himself to break forth with reckless and blind
   impetuosity into the language of imprecation; he must, moreover,
   repress the turbulent passions of his mind, and, instead of confining
   his thoughts exclusively to his own private interests, should rather
   employ his desires and affections in seeking to advance the glory of
   God. In short, if we would be true imitators of David, we must first
   clothe ourselves with the character of Christ, that he may not
   administer to us at the present day the same rebuke which he gave to
   two of his disciples of old,

   "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of,"
   (Luke 9:55.)

   David had complained that his enemies mingled his meat with gall; and
   now he prays that their table may be turned into a snare for them, and
   that the things which are for peace may be turned into a net for them.
   These expressions are metaphorical, and they imply a desire that
   whatever things had been allotted to them in providence for the
   preservation of life, and for their welfare and convenience, might be
   turned by God into the occasion or instrument of their destruction.
   From this we gather that as things which naturally and of themselves
   are hurtful, become the means of furthering our welfare when we are in
   favor with God; so, when his anger is kindled against us, all those
   things which have a native tendency to produce our happiness are
   cursed, and become so many causes of our destruction. It is an instance
   of the Divine justice, which ought deeply to impress our minds with
   awe, when the Holy Spirit declares that all the means of preserving
   life are deadly to the reprobate, (Titus 1:15;) so that the very sun,
   which carries healing under his wings, (Malachi 4:2,) breathes only a
   deadly exhalation for them.

   23. Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. The Psalmist
   here refers chiefly to two powers of the body, those of the eyes and of
   the loins; and I have no hesitation in considering his language as a
   prayer that God would deprive his enemies of reason and understanding,
   and at the same time enfeeble their strength, that they might be
   altogether unfitted for exerting themselves in any way. We know how
   indispensable it is, in order to the doing of any thing aright, that
   counsel go before to give light, and that there should also be added
   the power of putting what is purposed into execution. The curse here
   expressed impends over the heads of all the enemies of the Church; and,
   therefore, we have no reason to be terrified at the malice or fury of
   the wicked. God, whenever he pleases, can strike them suddenly with
   blindness, that they may see nothing, and by breaking their loins, [89]
   lay them prostrate in shame and confusion.

   24. Pour out thy fury upon them. It is not surprising that David utters
   a lengthened series of imprecations; for we know well that the frantic
   enemies of the Church, into whom it was his object to inspire terror,
   are not easily moved. He therefore lifts up his voice against them in
   tones of greater vehemence, that they might be led to desist from their
   wrongful and insolent conduct. He, however, had principally an eye to
   true believers, who, being oppressed with calamities, have no other
   stay to lean upon, but such as arises from the voice which they hear
   proceeding from the mouth of God, declaring the terrible vengeance
   which is prepared for their enemies, if, indeed, they are among the
   reprobate. As to those of whose repentance and amendment there was some
   hope, David would have had them to be corrected by chastisements; but
   as to those whose repentance and reformation were hopeless, he prays
   that destruction may fall upon their heads, that thus they might not
   escape the punishment which was appointed for them, and which they had
   deserved.

   25 Let their habitation be desolate. Here he proceeds farther than in
   the preceding verse, praying that God would cause his wrath to descend
   to their posterity; and it is no new thing for the sins of the fathers
   to be cast into the bosom of the children. As David uttered these
   imprecations by the inspiration and influence of the Holy Spirit, so he
   took them out of the law itself, in which God threatens that he will

   "visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and
   fourth generation of them that hate him," (Exodus 20:5)

   In this way he desires that the memorial of them may be cursed, and
   that thus God would not spare them even after their death.

   26. For they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten. He brings
   forward the crime with which they were chargeable, to make it manifest
   that they richly deserved such dreadful punishments. Some explain the
   verse in this way: "These enemies, O Lord! not content with the strokes
   which thou hast inflicted, have exercised their cruelty upon a wretched
   man, who had already been wounded by thy hand." And as it is the
   dictate of humanity to succor the afflicted, he who treads down the
   oppressed most assuredly betrays the brutal cruelty of his disposition.
   Others reject this exposition, whether upon sufficient ground I know
   not, observing that David, properly speaking, was not stricken or
   wounded by the hand of God, it being of the violent rage of his enemies
   that he complains through the whole of the psalm. Accordingly, they
   have recourse to a subtle interpretation, and view David as meaning
   that his enemies wickedly pretended that they had just cause against
   him, and boasted of being the ministers of God, whose office it was to
   execute punishment upon him as a wicked person. This is a pretext under
   which the wicked generally shield themselves, and by which they are led
   to think that they may lawfully do what they please against those who
   are in misery, without ever being called to account for it. Thus we
   find this purpose of the wicked expressed in another place,

   "Come let us persecute him, for God hath forsaken him;
   for there is none to deliver him," (Psalm 71:11.)

   But I am rather of opinion that the Psalmist applies the term smitten
   to the man whom God intended to humble as one of his own children; so
   that in the very chastisement or correction, there was engraven a mark
   of God's paternal love. And he employs the expression, the wounded of
   God, almost in the same sense in which Isaiah 26:19 speaks of the dead
   of God, the prophet thereby denoting those who continue under the
   Divine guardianship, even in death itself. This cannot be extended to
   all men in general, but is exclusively applicable to true believers,
   whose obedience God puts to the test by means of afflictions. If from
   this the wicked take occasion to persecute the righteous with greater
   severity, it is not to be wondered at if they involve themselves in
   heavier damnation. Upon seeing such examples set before them, the
   manner in which they should have reasoned with themselves is this,

   "If these things are done in a green tree,
   what shall be done in the dry?" (Luke 23:31.)

   But from their becoming more and more hardened, it is evident that the
   pride and insolence which they manifest against the children of God
   proceed from contempt and hatred of true religion. The Hebrew word
   ysphrv, yesapperu, which is usually translated they will recount, I
   would interpret differently. It properly signifies to number, and may,
   therefore, be properly enough translated to add to or increase, [90]
   giving here the meaning, That the persons spoken of, by adding misery
   to misery, raised grief to its utmost height.

   27. Add iniquity to their iniquity. As the Hebrew word 'vn, avon,
   signifies at times guilt as well as iniquity, some translate the verse
   thus, Add thou, that is, thou, O God! punishment to their punishment
   Others extend it yet further, regarding it as a prayer that wicked men
   might punish them for their wickedness. But it is abundantly evident,
   from the second clause, that what David prays for rather is, as is
   almost universally admitted, that God, taking his Spirit altogether
   from the wicked, would give them over to a reprobate mind, that they
   might never seek or have any desire to be brought to genuine repentance
   and amendment. Some interpret the phrase to come into righteousness as
   meaning to be absolved or acquitted; [91] but it seems to want the
   spirit of the language here used, by which David intends to express
   much more. Accordingly, the words ought to be expounded thus: Let their
   wickedness increase more and more, and let them turn away with
   abhorrence from all thought of amendment, to make it manifest that they
   are utterly alienated from God. [92] As this form of expression is
   familiar to the Sacred Writings, and every where to be met with, we
   ought not to think it harsh; and to wrest it, as some do, for the sake
   of avoiding what may have the appearance of absurdity, is ridiculous.
   The explanation they give of it is, That God adds sins to sins by
   permitting them; [93] and they defend such an exposition by asserting
   that this is an idiom of the Hebrew language, an assertion, the
   accuracy of which no Hebrew scholar will admit. Nor is it necessary to
   bring forward any such quibbles to excuse God; for, when he blinds the
   reprobate, it is sufficient for us to know that he has good and just
   causes for doing so; and it is in vain for men to murmur and to dispute
   with him, as if they sinned only by his impulse. Although the causes
   why they are blinded sometimes lie hidden in the secret purpose of
   Deity, there is not a man who is not reproved by his own conscience;
   and it is our duty to adore and admire the high mysteries of God, which
   surpass our understanding. It is justly said that "God's judgments are
   a great deep," (Psalm 36:6.) It would certainly be highly perverse to
   involve God in a part of the guilt of the wicked, whenever he executes
   his judgments upon them; as, for example, when he executes the judgment
   threatened in the passage before us. The amount is, that the wicked are
   plunged into a deep gulf of wickedness by the just vengeance of Heaven,
   that they may never return to a sound understanding, and that he who is
   filthy may become still more filthy, [94] (Revelation 22:11.) Let it
   further be observed, that I do not explain the righteousness of God as
   denoting the righteousness which he bestows upon his chosen ones in
   regenerating them by his Holy Spirit, but the holiness manifested in
   the life which is so well-pleasing to him.

   28. Let them be blotted out from the book of the living. [95] This is
   the last imprecation, and it is the most dreadful of the whole; but it
   nevertheless uniformly follows the persevered in impenitence and
   incorrigible obduracy of which the Psalmist has spoken above. After
   having taken away from them all hope of repentance, he denounces
   against them eternal destruction, which is the obvious meaning of the
   prayer, that they might be blotted out of the book of the living; for
   all those must inevitably perish who are not found written or enrolled
   in the book of life. This is indeed an improper manner of speaking; but
   it is one well adapted to our limited capacity, the book of life being
   nothing else than the eternal purpose of God, by which he has
   predestinated his own people to salvation. God, it is certain, is
   absolutely immutable; and, further, we know that those who are adopted
   to the hope of salvation were written before the foundation of the
   world, (Ephesians 1:4;) but as God's eternal purpose of election is
   incomprehensible, it is said, in accommodation to the imperfection of
   the human understanding, that those whom God openly, and by manifest
   signs, enrols among his people, are written. On the other hand, those
   whom God openly rejects and casts out of his Church are, for the same
   reason, said to be blotted out. As then David desires that the
   vengeance of God may be manifested, he very properly speaks of the
   reprobation of his enemies in language accommodated to our
   understanding; as if he had said, O God! reckon them not among the
   number or ranks of thy people, and let them not be gathered together
   with thy Church; but rather show by destroying them that thou hast
   rejected them; and although they occupy a place for a time among thy
   faithful ones, do thou at length cut them off, to make it manifest that
   they were aliens, though they were mingled with the members of thy
   family. Ezekiel uses language of similar import when he says,

   "And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that
   divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither
   shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel."
   (Ezekiel 13:9)

   That, however, continues true which is spoken by the Apostle John, (1
   John 2:19,) that none who have been once really the children of God
   will ever finally fall away or be wholly cut off. [96] But as
   hypocrites presumptuously boast that they are the chief members of the
   Church, the Holy Spirit well expresses their rejection, by the figure
   of their being blotted out of the book of life. Moreover, it is to be
   observed that, in the second clause, all the elect of God are called
   the righteous; for, as Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, 4, 7,

   "This is the will of God, even our sanctification, that every one of us
   should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor: for
   God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness." (1
   Thessalonians 4:3, 4, 7)

   And the climax which the same Apostle uses in the 8th chapter of his
   Epistle to the Romans, at the 30th verse, is well known:

   "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom
   he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified,
   them he also glorified." (Romans 8:30)

   29. As for me, I am poor and sorrowful. [97] From this verse we
   perceive more distinctly how David cast away from him the swelling and
   raging passion of those who, with ungovernable fury, pour forth
   imprecation and vengeance. He here, without doubt, offers himself to
   God with the sacrifice of a broken and humble heart, that by this
   meekness of spirit he may obtain favor with him. He therefore adds
   immediately after, Thy salvation shall exalt me. Those assuredly who
   are impelled to avenge themselves by their own ungovernable spirits are
   so far from being humbled, that they exalt themselves to a position to
   which they are not entitled. There is here a mutual relation stated
   between the sorrow with which he was oppressed, and the help of God by
   which he hoped to be lifted up. At the same time, he assures himself
   that the very thing which others considered as a ground for despair,
   would prove to him the cause of his salvation. This sentence might also
   be explained adversatively thus: Although I now mourn under the
   pressure of affliction, yet shall thy salvation, O Lord! exalt me. But
   for my part, I consider it certain that David brings forward his own
   affliction as a plea for obtaining mercy at the hand of God. Nor does
   he say simply that he will be raised up, but he expressly speaks of
   being exalted; and in this he alludes to fortresses which are set upon
   high places; for this is the proper signification of the Hebrew word
   sgv, sagab, here employed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [86] This and the following verses, which are here expressed in the
   form of imprecations, are translated by many in the future tense, as
   predictions: "Their table before them shall be for a snare," etc.

   [87] The LXX. have rendered the word here translated prosperity by a
   word which signifies recompense: "Let their table before them be for a
   snare, kai eis antapodosin, and for a recompense, and for a
   stumbling-block." Paul, in quoting this and the verse immediately
   following, as descriptive of the judgments which befell the Jews after
   their rejection of the Messiah, quotes with some slight difference the
   words of the LXX. He has, Eis antapooma autois, "for a retribution upon
   them." The Psalmist's enemies had given him gall for his meat, and in
   his thirst vinegar to drink, and he denounces on them evils similar in
   kind: as if he had said, Would that their own table may be made bitter
   by misery and misfortune, and the food provided for the nourishment and
   strengthening of their bodies turned, in the righteous retribution of
   God, into the means of their injury and destruction. "Michaelis," says
   Walford, "shows how exactly these comminations were fulfilled in the
   history of the final siege of Jerusalem by the Romans. Many thousands
   of the Jews had assembled in the city to eat the Paschal lamb, when
   Titus unexpectedly made an assault upon them. In this siege the greater
   part of the inhabitants of Jerusalem miserably perished."

   [88] "Mais estant conduit par le Sainct Esprit, il n'a point passe
   outre les limites." -- Fr.

   [89] The loins are the seat of strength in every animal; and hence the
   prayer, "Make their loins continually to tremble," is just a prayer
   that their strength might be impaired, or entirely taken away.

   [90] This is the translation given by the LXX., who read, prosethekan,
   "they added to;" and similar is that of the Syriac, Vulgate, Arabic,
   and Æthiopic versions, and of the learned Castellio, who reads,
   "Sauciorum tuorum numerum adaugentes," "increasing the number of thy
   wounded." "sphr," says Hammond, "signifies to number, and of that we
   know addition is one sort."

   [91] This is the idea attached to it by Horsley, who translates the
   verse thus: "Give them punishment upon punishment, and admit them not
   to thy justification." Cresswell explains it thus: "Let them not be
   restored to thy favor, nor experience thy clemency."

   [92] "Qu'ils sont alienez et bannis de la presence de Dieu." -- Fr.
   "That they are alienated and banished from the presence of God."

   [93] This is the explanation given by Hammond. The Hebrew word ntn,
   nathan, here rendered add, he translates give or permit, which he
   supports in the following note. "That ntm, to give, signifies also to
   permit, appears by Esther 9:13, yntn, let it be given to the Jews,' i
   e., permitted them. So Exodus 12:23, And shall not suffer (the Hebrew
   hath ytn, give) the destroyer to come in; the Chaldee reads ysvq,
   permit,' and the LXX. athesei, to the same sense. So Psalm 16:10, Thou
   shalt not suffer (ytm, again, give) thy Holy One to see corruption.'
   And so tnh vn, give wickedness, is no more than permit: for so it is
   ordinary with God, as a punishment of some former great sin or sins,
   though not to infuse any malignity, yet by withdrawing his grace, and
   delivering them up to themselves, to permit more sins to follow, one on
   the heels of the other, and so to be so far from reforming and amending
   as daily to grow worse and worse, to be more obdurate, and so finally
   never to enter into God's righteousness; i e., into that way of
   obedience required by him, and which will be accepted by him, or (as
   tsdq, in the notion of mercy, may signify being applied to God) into
   his mercy, so as to be made partakers of it." A fuller statement and
   illustration of Calvin's views on this point is given in his
   Institutes, Book I. chapter 18.

   [94] In the French version, the two last verbs of the sentence are put
   in the future tense, by which the idea conveyed is somewhat modified:
   "En sorte qu'ils ne retourneront jamais, a bon sens, et celuy qui est
   ord, deviendra encore plus ord." -- "So that they shall never return to
   a sound understanding, and he who is filthy will become still more
   filthy."

   [95] "This phrase," observes Bishop Mant, "which is not unusual in
   Scripture, alludes to the custom of well ordered cities, which kept
   registers, containing all the names of the citizens. Out of these
   registers the names of apostates, fugitives, and criminals, were
   erased, as also those of the deceased: whence the expression blotting,'
   or erasing names from the book of life.'"

   [96] "Et se retrancher du tout." -- Fr.

   [97] Boothroyd reads, "humbled and afflicted!"

   Psalm 69:30-33

   30. I will celebrate the name of God in a song, and I will magnify him
   in praise. [98] 31. And this will please Jehovah more than a young
   bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 32. The afflicted have seen it, and
   those who seek God shall rejoice at it; and your heart shall live. 33.
   For Jehovah hath hearkened to the afflicted; and hath not despised his
   prisoners.


   30. I will celebrate the name of God in a song. The Psalmist now
   elevated with joy, and sustained by the confident hope of deliverance,
   sings the triumphant strains of victory. This psalm, there is every
   reason to believe, was composed after he had been delivered from all
   apprehension of dangers; but there can be no doubt that the very topics
   with which it concludes were the matter of his meditation, when
   trembling with anxiety in the midst of his troubles; for he laid hold
   upon the grace of God by assured faith, although that grace was then
   hidden from him, and only the matter of his hope. God is here said to
   be magnified by our praises; not because any addition can be made to
   his dignity and glory, which are infinite, but because by our praises
   his name is exalted among men.

   31. And this will please Jehovah more than a young bullock. The more
   effectually to strengthen himself for this exercise, David affirms that
   the thanksgiving which he is about to tender, will be to God a
   sacrifice of a sweet and an acceptable savor. There cannot be a more
   powerful incitement to thanksgiving than the certain conviction that
   this religious service is highly pleasing to God; even as the only
   recompense which he requires for all the benefits which he lavishes
   upon us is, that we honor and praise his name. This sets in a stronger
   light the inexcusableness of those who are so sluggish as, by their
   silence or forgetfulness, to suppress the praises of God. David neither
   omitted nor despised the outward sacrifices which the law enjoined; but
   he very justly preferred the spiritual service, which was the end of
   all the Levitical ceremonies. This subject I have treated at greater
   length on [5]Psalm 50:14. By the way, the humility of David is worthy
   of being noticed, who, although he rose so high as to be a heavenly
   pattern, yet disdained not to humble himself for the common benefit of
   the Church, as if he had belonged to the common class of the people,
   that by the figures of the law he might learn the truth which has since
   been more clearly manifested in the gospel; namely, that the praises of
   God, in so far as they proceed from our mouths, are impure, until they
   are sanctified by Christ. But how gross and stupid is the superstition
   of those who would again bring into use the outward pomp of ceremonies
   which were abolished by the one sacrifice of Christ's death, and think
   that God is truly pacified when they have wearied themselves with doing
   nothing! What does this amount to, but to obscure or cover, by the
   intervention of thick veils, this legitimate service of thanksgiving,
   which David had no hesitation in greatly preferring to the Mosaic
   ceremonies, although these were of divine appointment? By a young
   bullock, he means one of the most choice or select and the idea which
   he intends to convey is, that there was no sacrifice or victim, however
   valuable or precious, that he could offer, in which God would take so
   great delight as in thanksgiving.

   32. The afflicted have seen it. He here shows that the blessed effects
   of his deliverance will extend to others as well as to himself, a point
   which he frequently insists on in the Psalms, as we have seen in Psalm
   22:23, 26, and in many other places. And his object in doing this is,
   partly to commend the goodness and grace of God to true believers, and
   partly that by this as an argument he may prevail with God to succor
   him. Besides, he does not mean that God's people would rejoice at this
   spectacle merely on the ground of brotherly friendship, but because, in
   the deliverance of one man, a pledge would be given to others,
   affording them also assurance of salvation. For this very reason he
   terms them the afflicted. Whoever seek God, (says he,) although they
   may be subjected to afflictions, will nevertheless take courage from my
   example. The first and the second clauses of the verse must be read
   together; for a connected sense would not be preserved were we not to
   understand the meaning to be this, That the example of David would
   afford a ground of rejoicing to all the faithful servants of God when
   they should seek a remedy for their afflictions. He very properly
   conjoins the desire of seeking God with affliction; for all men do not
   so profit under the chastening hand of God as to seek salvation from
   him in the exercise of a sincere and ardent faith. In the concluding
   part of this verse there is a change of person: And your heart shall
   live. But this apostrophe is so far from rendering the sense obscure,
   that, on the contrary, it expresses it the more forcibly, as if a thing
   present were described. In addressing those who were so much under the
   pressure of affliction as to be laid prostrate like dead men, he
   exhibits to their view a kind of image of the resurrection; as if he
   had said, O ye who are dead! unto you new vigor shall be restored. It
   is not meant that faith perishes in the children of God, and remains
   entirely dead until it is quickened into life again by the example of
   the deliverance of others; but that the light which was quenched is
   rekindled, and thus, so to speak, recovers life anew. The Psalmist
   immediately after (verse 33) describes the means by which this will be
   brought about in the children of God, which is, that believing the
   deliverance of David to be a common token or pledge of the grace of God
   presented before them, they will confidently come to the conclusion,
   that God regards the needy, and does not despise the prisoners. We thus
   see that he considers what was done to one man, as a clear indication
   on the part of God that he will be ready to succor all who are in
   adversity. [99]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] Venema and others conjecture, that what follows, from this verse
   to the end of the psalm, was added during the captivity of the Jews in
   Babylon; while others, from the expressions occurring in these verses,
   refer the whole psalm to that period; and observe, that the Hebrew
   letter l, lamed, prefixed to David's name in the title, does not always
   signify of; but sometimes, as in Genesis 1:11, means according to, and
   so may be intended to describe this psalm as being after the manner of
   David. But Paul, in Romans 11:9, ascribes it to David.

   Psalm 69:34-36

   34. Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the seas, and whatever
   creepeth in them. 35. For God will save Zion, and will build the cities
   of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it by inheritance.
   36. And the seed of his servants shall inherit it; and they who love
   his name shall dwell in it.


   34. Let the heavens and the earth praise him. From this we may conclude
   with the greater certainty, that, as I have touched upon above, David
   in the whole of this psalm spake in the name of the whole Church; for
   he now transfers to the Church what he had spoken in particular
   concerning himself. In calling upon the elements, which are destitute
   of thought or understanding, to praise God, he speaks hyperbolically,
   and by this manner of expression, he would teach us that we are not
   animated with sufficient earnestness of heart in celebrating the
   praises of God, the infinitude of which overpasses the whole world,
   unless we rise above our own understandings. But what above all kindled
   this ardor in the heart of David was his concern for the preservation
   of the Church. Moreover, there is no doubt that by the Spirit of
   prophecy he comprehended the whole of that period during which God
   would have the kingdom and priesthood continued among the ancient
   people of Israel. Yet he begins at the restoration of a new state of
   things, which by his means was suddenly brought about upon the death of
   Saul, when a melancholy devastation threatened at once the utter
   destruction of the worship of God, and the desolation of the whole
   country. He says, in the first place, that Zion shall be saved, because
   God would defend the place where he had chosen to be called upon, and
   would not suffer the worship which he himself had appointed to be
   abolished. In the next place, from the ark of the covenant and the
   sanctuary, he represents the divine blessing as extending to the whole
   land; for religion was the foundation upon which the happiness of the
   people rested. He farther teaches, that this change to the better would
   not be of short continuance; but that the people would be always
   preserved safe through the constant and enduring protection of God: And
   they shall dwell there, and possess it by inheritance. He therefore
   intimates, that the promise which God had so often made in the law,
   That they should inherit that land forever, was truly confirmed by the
   commencement of his reign. He contrasts tranquil and settled abode with
   a mere temporary residence; as if he had said, Now that the sacred
   throne is erected, the time is come in which the children of Abraham
   will enjoy the rest which has been promised to them, without fear of
   being removed from it.

   36. And the seed of his servants shall inherit it. In this verse he
   declares that the blessing now mentioned would extend through a
   continued succession of ages -- that, the fathers would transmit to
   their children the possession which they had received, as from hand to
   hand, and the children to their children; and the enduring possession
   of all good things depends upon Christ, of whom David was a type. Yet
   the Psalmist at the same time briefly intimates, that such only as are
   the legitimate children of Abraham shall inherit the land: They who
   love his name shall dwell in it. It was needful to take away all
   grounds for self-gloriation from hypocrites, who, looking to and
   depending solely upon the circumstances connected with the origin of
   their race, foolishly boasted that the land belonged to them by right
   of inheritance, notwithstanding of their having apostatised from the
   faith of their ancestors. Although that land was given to the chosen
   people to be possessed until the advent of Christ, we should remember
   that it was a type of the heavenly inheritance, and that, therefore,
   what is here written concerning the protection of the Church, has
   received a more true and substantial fulfillment in our own day. There
   is no reason to fear that the building of the spiritual temple, in
   which the celestial power of God has been manifested, will ever fall
   into ruins.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] The particular enemies of whom he speaks are uncertain; some
   referring the occasion of the composition of the psalm to his
   persecution by Saul, and others to the rebellion of Absalom. But to
   whatever part of David's eventful life the psalm primarily refers, it
   may be concluded, from the frequency with which it is quoted and
   applied to Christ in the New Testament, that it was prophetic of him,
   of whom David, rejected and persecuted, was an eminent type. It is
   quoted in the New Testament at least seven times; the 4th verse in John
   15:25; the 9th verse in John 2:17, and Romans 15:3; the 21st verse in
   Matthew 27:34, 48, and John 19:28, 29; the 22d and 23d verses in Romans
   11:9, 10; and the 25th verse in Acts 1:16, 20.

   [64] They rest this opinion upon the meaning which they attach to the
   word ssnym, Shoshannim, in the title of the psalm, which they translate
   lilies
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 70

   This psalm is merely a part of the fortieth, and the inscription, To
   call to remembrance, is perhaps designed to indicate this; David having
   taken these five verses out of that other psalm, and accommodated them
   for being used on some particular occasion. I shall only here repeat
   the words of the text; and would refer the reader for the
   interpretation to [6]the proper place.

   To the chief musician of David, to call to remembrance.

   Psalm 70:1-5

   1. O God! make haste to deliver me: O Jehovah! hasten to my help. 2.
   Let those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; let those who
   desire my hurt be turned backward, and put to confusion 3. Let those
   who say to me, Aha! aha! perish as a reward of their shame. 4. Let all
   those who seek thee rejoice and exult in thee: let those who love thy
   salvation say, Let God be magnified for evermore! 5. As for me, I am
   poor and needy: O God! hasten to me: thou art my help and my deliverer:
   O Jehovah! make no delay.

     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 71 [100]

   David, having spoken at the outset of his confidence in God, partly
   calls upon him for deliverance, and partly complains of the pride of
   his enemies. At length, to confirm his faith, he prepares himself for
   yielding a grateful ascription of praise for the benefits which God had
   conferred upon him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 71:1-4

   1. In thee, O Jehovah! do I put my trust; let me not be put to
   confusion for ever. 2. Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me:
   incline thy ear to me, and save me. 3. Be thou to me for a rock of
   strength, [101] [or for a strong rock,] into which I may at all times
   enter: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my tower
   and my fortress. 4. O my God! deliver me from the hand of the wicked
   man; from the hand of the perverse and violent man.


   1. In thee, O Jehovah! do I put my trust. It has been thought that the
   occasion of the composition of this psalm was the conspiracy of
   Absalom; and the particular reference which David makes to his old age
   renders this conjecture not improbable. As when we approach God, it is
   faith alone which opens the way for us, David, in order to obtain what
   he sought, protests, according to his usual manner, that he does not
   pour forth at the throne of grace hypocritical prayers, but betakes
   himself to God with sincerity of heart, fully persuaded that his
   salvation is laid up in the Divine hand. The man whose mind is in a
   state of constant fluctuation, and whose hope is divided by being
   turned in different directions, in each of which he is looking for
   deliverance, or who, under the influence of fear, disputes with
   himself, or who obstinately refuses the Divine assistance, or who frets
   and gives way to restless impatience, is unworthy of being succoured by
   God. The particle lvlm, leolam, in the end of the first verse, which we
   have translated for ever, admits of a twofold sense, as I have shown on
   [7]Psalm 31:1. It either tacitly implies a contrast between the present
   calamities of David and the happy issue which he anticipated; as if he
   had said, Lord, I lie in the dust at present as one confounded; but the
   time will come when thou wilt grant me deliverance. Or not to be
   ashamed for ever, means never to be ashamed. As these verses almost
   correspond with the beginning of the 31st psalm, I would refer to that
   place for those explanatory remarks which I here purposely omit, not
   wishing to tax the patience of my readers by unnecessary repetition.

   In these words of the third verse, Into which I may at all times enter,
   which are not to be found in the other psalm, David briefly prays that
   he may have so ready and easy access to God for succor, as to find in
   him a secure refuge whenever threatened by any immediate danger. Lord!
   as if he had said, let me always find ready succor in thee, and do thou
   meet me with a smile of benignity and grace, when I betake myself to
   thee. The expression which follows, Thou hast given commandment to save
   me, is resolved by some interpreters into the optative mood; as if
   David requested that he might be committed to the guardianship of
   angels. But it is better to retain the past tense of the verb, and to
   understand him as encouraging himself, from his experience in times
   past, to hope for a happy issue to his present calamities. Nor is there
   any necessity for limiting to the angels the verb, thou hast given
   commandment. God, no doubt, employs them in defending his people; but
   as he is possessed of innumerable ways of saving them, the expression,
   I conceive, is used indefinitely, to teach us that he gives commandment
   concerning the salvation of his servants, according as he has purposed,
   whenever he gives some manifest token of his favor toward them in his
   providence; and what he has determined in his own mind, he executes
   sometimes by his nod alone, and sometimes by the instrumentality of men
   or other creatures. Meanwhile, David would intimate that such is the
   all-sufficient power of God intrinsically considered, that without
   having recourse to any foreign aid, his commandment alone is abundantly
   adequate for effecting our salvation.

   4. O my God! deliver me from the hand of the wicked man. Here he uses
   the singular number; but he is not to be understood as indicating one
   man only. [102] It is highly probable that he comprehends the whole
   host of the enemies who assaulted him. We have elsewhere had occasion
   to observe how greatly it contributes to inspire us with the confidence
   of obtaining our requests, when we are so assured of our own integrity,
   as to be able freely to complain before God that we are unjustly and
   wickedly assaulted by our enemies; for we ought not to doubt that God,
   who has promised to become the defender of those who are unjustly
   oppressed, will, in that case, undertake our cause.

   [101] In the Hebrew it is, "Be thou to me for a rock of habitation."
   But instead of mvn, maon, "habitation," many of Dr Kennicott's and De
   Rossi's MSS. have mvz, maoz, "munition," or "defense." "Be thou my rock
   of defence."

   [102] At the same time, it may be observed, that if this psalm was
   written during the rebellion of Absalom, this cruel son or Achitophel
   may be the person whom David has here in his eye, and describes in the
   singular number. If he refers to his own son, how deep must have been
   his agony of soul to be under the necessity of appealing to God in his
   present distressing circumstances, against an unnatural and wicked
   child, around whom all the affections of his heart were intwined! What
   Calvin renders, in the last clause of the verse, "the violent man," is
   literally "leavened man." Leaven seems to be an image for deep and
   inveterate depravity of any kind. "Beware of the leaven of the
   Pharisees and of the Sadducees," said our Lord. -- (Matthew 16:6; see
   also 1 Corinthians 5:8.)

   Psalm 71:5-8

   5. For thou art my expectation, [or hope,] O Lord Jehovah! My trust
   from my youth. 6. Upon thee have I leaned [or have I been sustained]
   from the womb: [103] thou art he that took me out of my mother's
   bowels: my praise is continually of thee. 7. I have been as a prodigy
   to the great ones, [104] and yet [105] thou art my strong confidence.
   8. My mouth shall be filled with thy praise and with thy glory daily.


   5. For thou art my expectation, O Lord Jehovah! The Psalmist here
   repeats what he had said a little before concerning his trust or
   confidence. But some, perhaps, may be inclined to refer this sentence
   rather to the matter or ground afforded him for hope and confidence
   than to the emotions of his heart; supposing him to mean, that by the
   benefits which God had conferred upon him, he was furnished with
   well-grounded hope. And certainly he does not here simply declare that
   he hoped in God, but with this he conjoins experience, and acknowledges
   that even from his youth he had received tokens of the Divine favor,
   from which he might learn, that confidence is to be reposed in God
   alone. By adverting to what God had done for him, [106] he expresses
   the real cause of faith, (if I may so speak;) and from this we may
   easily perceive the powerful influence which the remembrance of God's
   benefits had in nourishing his hope.

   6. Upon thee have I been sustained from the womb. This verse
   corresponds with the preceding, except that David proceeds farther. He
   not only celebrates the goodness of God which he had experienced from
   his childhood, but also those proofs of it which he had received
   previous to his birth. An almost similar confession is contained in
   Psalm 22:9, 10, by which is magnified the wonderful power and
   inestimable goodness of God in the generation of men, the way and
   manner of which would be altogether incredible, were it not a fact with
   which we are quite familiar. If we are astonished at that part of the
   history of the flood, in which Moses declares (Genesis 8:13) that Noah
   and his household lived ten months amidst the offensive nuisance
   produced by so many living creatures, when he could not draw the breath
   of life, have we not equal reason to marvel that the infant, shut up
   within its mother's womb, can live in such a condition as would
   suffocate the strongest man in half an hour? But we thus see how little
   account we make of the miracles which God works, in consequence of our
   familiarity with them. The Spirit, therefore, justly rebukes this
   ingratitude, by commending to our consideration this memorable instance
   of the grace of God, which is exhibited in our birth and generation.
   When we are born into the world, although the mother do her office, and
   the midwife may be present with her, and many others may lend their
   help, yet did not God, putting, so to speak, his hand under us, receive
   us into his bosom, what would become of us? and what hope would there
   be of the continuance of our life? Yea, rather, were it not for this,
   our very birth would be an entrance into a thousand deaths. God,
   therefore, is with the highest propriety said to take us out of our
   mother's bowels To this corresponds the concluding part of the verse,
   My praise is continually of thee; by which the Psalmist means that he
   had been furnished with matter for praising God without intermission.

   7. I have been as a prodigy to the great ones. He now makes a
   transition to the language of complaint, declaring that he was held in
   almost universal abhorrence by reason of the great calamities with
   which he was afflicted. There is an apparent, although only an
   apparent, discrepancy between these two statements; first, that he had
   always been crowned with the benefits of God; and, secondly, that he
   was accounted as a prodigy on account of his great afflictions; but we
   may draw from thence the very profitable doctrine, that he was not so
   overwhelmed by his calamities, heavy though they were, as to be
   insensible to the goodness of God which he had experienced. Although,
   therefore, he saw that he was an object of detestation, yet the
   remembrance of the blessings which God had conferred upon him, could
   not be extinguished by the deepest shades of darkness which surrounded
   him, but served as a lamp in his heart to direct his faith. By the term
   prodigy [107] is expressed no ordinary calamity. Had he not been
   afflicted in a strange and unusual manner, those to whom the miserable
   condition of mankind was not unknown would not have shrunk from him
   with such horror, and regarded him as so repulsive a spectacle. It was,
   therefore, a higher and more commendable proof of his constancy, that
   his spirit was neither broken nor enfeebled with sham but reposed in
   God with the stronger confidence, the more he was cast off by the
   world. The sentence is to be explained adversatively, implying that,
   although men abhorred him as a monster, yet, by leaning upon God, he
   continued in despite of all this unmoved. If it should be thought
   preferable to translate the word rvym, rabbim, which I have rendered
   great ones, by the word many, the sense will be, That David's
   afflictions were generally known, and had acquired great notoriety, as
   if he had been brought forth upon a stage and exposed to the view of
   the whole people. But in my opinion it will be more suitable to
   understand the word of great men, or the nobles. There is no heart so
   strong and impervious to outward influences as not to be deeply pierced
   when those who are considered to excel in wisdom and judgment, and who
   are invested with authority, treat a suffering and an afflicted man
   with such indignity, that they shrink with horror from him, as if he
   were a monster. In the next verse, as if he had obtained the desire of
   his heart, he expresses it to be his resolution to yield a grateful
   acknowledgement to God. To encourage himself to hope with the greater
   confidence for a happy issue to his present troubles, he promises
   loudly to celebrate the praises of God, and to do this not only on one
   occasion, but to persevere in the exercise without intermission.

   Psalm 71:9-13

   9. Cast me not off in the time of my old age: forsake me not in the
   declining of my strength. 10. For my enemies have said of me, and those
   who watch for my life have taken counsel together, 11. Saying, God hath
   forsaken him; follow after him, and ye shall take him: for there is
   none to deliver him. 12. O God! be not far from me: my God: hasten to
   my aid. 13. Let those who are enemies to my life be confounded [108]
   and fail: let those who seek my hurt be covered with reproach and
   shame.


   9. Cast me not off in the time of my old age. David having just now
   declared that God had been the protector of his life at his birth, and
   afterwards his foster-father in his childhood, and the guardian of his
   welfare during the whole course of his past existence; being now worn
   out with age, casts himself anew into the fatherly bosom of God. In
   proportion as our strength fails us -- and then necessity itself impels
   us to seek God -- in the same proportion should our hope in the
   willingness and readiness of God to succor us become strong. David's
   prayer, in short, amounts to this: "Do thou, O Lord, who hast sustained
   me vigorous and strong in the flower of my youth, not forsake me now,
   when I am decayed and almost withered, but the more I stand in need of
   thy help, let the decrepitude and infirmities of age move thee to
   compassionate me the more." From this verse expositors, not without
   good reason, conclude that the conspiracy of Absalom is the subject
   treated of in this psalm. And certainly it was a horrible and tragical
   spectacle, which tended to lead, not only the common people, but also
   those who excelled in authority, to turn away their eyes from him, as
   they would from a detestable monster, when the son, having driven his
   father from the kingdom, pursued him even through the very deserts to
   put him to death.

   10. For my enemies have said of me, etc. He pleads, as an argument with
   God to show him mercy, the additional circumstance, that the wicked
   took greater license in cruelly persecuting him, from the belief which
   they entertained that he was rejected and abandoned of God. The basest
   of men, as we all know, become more bold and audacious, when, in
   tormenting the innocent, they imagine that this is a matter in which
   they have not to deal with God at all. Not only are they encouraged by
   the hope of escaping unpunished; but they also boast that all comes to
   pass according to their wishes, when no obstacle presents itself to
   restrain their wicked desires. What happened to David at that time is
   almost the ordinary experience of the children of God; namely, that the
   wicked, when once they come to believe that it is by the will of God
   that his people are exposed to them for a prey, give themselves
   uncontrolled license in doing them mischief. Measuring the favor of God
   only by what is the present condition of men, they conceive that all
   whom he suffers to be afflicted are despised, forsaken, and cast off by
   him. Such being their persuasion, they encourage and stimulate one
   another to practice every thing harassing and injurious against them,
   as persons who have none to undertake and avenge their cause. But this
   wanton and insulting [109] procedure on their part ought to encourage
   our hearts, since the glory of God requires that the promises which he
   has so frequently made of succouring the poor and afflicted should be
   actually performed. The ungodly may flatter themselves with the hope of
   obtaining pardon from him; but this foolish imagination does not by any
   means lessen the criminality of their conduct. On the contrary, they do
   a double injury to God, by taking away from him that which especially
   belongs to him.

   12. O God! be not far from me. It is scarcely possible to express how
   severe and hard a temptation it was to David, when he knew that the
   wicked entertained the persuasion that he was rejected of God. They did
   not without consideration circulate this report; but after having
   seemed wisely to weigh all circumstances, they gave their judgment on
   the point as of a thing which was placed beyond all dispute. It was
   therefore an evidence of heroic fortitude on the part of David, [110]
   thus to rise superior to their perverse judgments, and, in the face of
   them all, to assure himself that God would be gracious to him, and to
   betake himself familiarly to him. Nor is it to be doubted that, in
   calling God his God, he makes use of this as a means of defending
   himself from this hard and grievous assault.

   While invoking the aid of God, he at the same time prays (verse 13)
   that his enemies may be filled with shame until they be consumed. These
   words, however, may not improperly be read in the future tense; for it
   is frequently the practice of David, after having ended his prayer, to
   rise up against his enemies, and, as it were, to triumph over them. But
   I have followed that which seems more agreeable to the scope of the
   passage. Having had occasion elsewhere to explain this imprecation, it
   is unnecessary for me to repeat, in this place, what I have previously
   said.

   Psalm 71:14-16

   14. But I will hope continually, and will add [111] to all thy praise.
   15. My mouth shall recount thy righteousness and thy salvation daily;
   for I know not the number thereof. 16. I will go in the strengths of
   the Lord Jehovah! I will make mention of thy righteousness only.


   14. But I will hope continually. David again, as having obtained the
   victory, prepares himself for thanksgiving. There is, however, no
   doubt, that during the time when the wicked derided his simplicity, he
   struggled manfully amidst his distresses, as may be gathered from the
   word hope. Although, to outward appearance, there was no prospect of
   deliverance from his troubles, and although the wicked ceased not
   proudly to pour contempt upon his trust in God, he nevertheless
   determined to persevere in the exercise of hope; even as it is a
   genuine proof of faith, to look exclusively to the Divine promise, in
   order to be guided by its light alone amidst the thickest darkness of
   afflictions. The strength, then, of the hope of which David speaks, is
   to be estimated by the conflicts which he at that time sustained. In
   saying, I will add to all thy praises, he shows the confidence with
   which he anticipated a desirable escape from his troubles. It is as if
   he had said -- Lord, I have been long accustomed to receive benefits
   from thee, and this fresh accession to them, I doubt not, will furnish
   me with new matter for celebrating thy grace.

   15. My mouth shall recount thy righteousness Here he expresses more
   clearly what sacrifice of praise he resolved to present to God,
   promising to proclaim continually his righteousness and salvation. I
   have often before had occasion to observe, that the righteousness of
   God does not mean that property of his nature by which he renders to
   every man his own, but the faithfulness which he observes towards his
   own people, when he cherishes, defends, and delivers them. Hence the
   inestimable consolation which arises from learning that our salvation
   is so inseparably linked with the righteousness of God, as to have the
   same stability with this Divine attribute. The salvation of God, it is
   very evident, is taken in this place actively. The Psalmist connects
   this salvation with righteousness, as the effect with the cause; for
   his confident persuasion of obtaining salvation proceeded solely from
   reflecting that God is righteous, and that he cannot deny himself. As
   he had been saved so often, and in so many different ways, and so
   wonderfully, he engages to apply himself continually to the celebration
   of the grace of God. The particle ky, ki, which we have translated for,
   is by some rendered adversatively although, and explained in this way:
   Although the salvation of God is to me incomprehensible, and transcends
   my capacity, yet I will recount it. But the proper signification of the
   word is more suitable in this place, there being nothing which ought to
   be more effectual in kindling and exciting our hearts to sing the
   praises of God, than the innumerable benefits which he has bestowed
   upon us. Although our hearts may not be affected from having
   experienced only one or two of the Divine benefits; although they may
   remain cold and unmoved by a small number of them, yet our ingratitude
   is inexcusable, if we are not awakened from our torpor and indifference
   when an innumerable multitude of them are lavished upon us. Let us
   learn then not to taste of the goodness of God slightly, and, as it
   were, with loathing, but to apply all our faculties to it in all its
   amplitude, that it may ravish us with admiration. It is surprising that
   the authors of the Greek version ever thought of translating this
   clause, I have not known learning, [112] an error unworthy of being
   noticed, were it not that some fanatics in former times, to flatter
   themselves in their ignorance, boasted that, after the example of
   David, all learning and liberal sciences should be despised; even as,
   in the present day, the Anabaptists have no other pretext for boasting
   of being spiritual persons, but that they are grossly ignorant [113] of
   all science.

   16. I will go in the strength of the Lord Jehovah! This may also very
   properly be translated, I will go into the strengths; and this
   interpretation is not less probable than the other. As fear and sorrow
   take possession of our minds in the time of danger, from our not
   reflecting with that deep and earnest attention which becomes us upon
   the power of God; so the only remedy for alleviating our sorrow in our
   afflictions is to enter into God's strengths, that they may surround
   and defend us on all sides. But the other reading, which is more
   generally received, I have thought proper to retain, because it also is
   very suitable, although interpreters differ as to its meaning. Some
   explain it, I will go forth to battle depending upon the power of God.
   But this is too restricted. To go is equivalent to abiding in a steady,
   settled, and permanent state. True believers, it must indeed be
   granted, so far from putting forth their energies without difficulty,
   and flying with alacrity in their heavenly course, rather groan through
   weariness; but as they surmount with invincible courage all obstacles
   and difficulties, not drawing back, or declining from the right way, or
   at least not failing through despair, they are on this account said to
   go forward until they have arrived at the termination of their course.
   In short, David boasts that he will never be disappointed of the help
   of God till he reach the mark. And because nothing is more rare or
   difficult in the present state of weakness and infirmity than to
   continue persevering, he collects all his thoughts in order to rely
   with entire confidence exclusively on the righteousness of God. When he
   says that he will be mindful of it ONLY, the meaning is, that,
   forsaking all corrupt confidences with which almost the whole world is
   driven about, he will depend wholly upon the protection of God, not
   allowing himself to wander after his own imaginations, or to be drawn
   hither and thither by surrounding objects.

   Augustine quotes this text more than a hundred times as an argument to
   overthrow the merit of works, and plausibly opposes the righteousness
   which God gratuitously bestows to the meritorious righteousness of men.
   It must, however, be confessed that he wrests the words of David, and
   puts a sense upon them foreign to their genuine meaning, which simply
   is, that he does not rely upon his own wisdom, nor upon his own skill,
   nor upon his own strength, nor upon any riches which he possessed, as a
   ground for entertaining the confident hope of salvation, but that the
   only ground upon which he rests this hope is, that as God is righteous,
   it is impossible for God to forsake him. The righteousness of God, as
   we have just now observed, does not here denote that free gift by which
   he reconciles men to himself, or by which he regenerates them to
   newness of life; but his faithfulness in keeping his promises, by which
   he means to show that he is righteous, upright, and true towards his
   servants. Now, the Psalmist declares that the righteousness of God
   alone will be continually before his eyes, and in his memory; for
   unless we keep our minds fixed upon this alone, Satan, who is possessed
   of wonderful means by which to allure, will succeed in leading us
   astray after vanity. As soon as hopes from different quarters begin to
   insinuate themselves into our minds, there is nothing of which we are
   more in danger than of falling away. And whoever, not content with the
   grace of God alone, seeks elsewhere for the least succor, will
   assuredly fall, and thereby serve as an example to teach others how
   vain it is to attempt to mingle the stays of the world with the help of
   God. If David, in regard to his mere external condition in life, could
   remain stable and secure only by renouncing all other confidences, and
   casting himself upon the righteousness of God; what stability, I pray
   you to consider, are we likely to have, when the reference is to the
   spiritual and everlasting life, if we fall away, let it be never so
   little, from our dependence upon the grace of God? It is, therefore,
   undeniable that the doctrine invented by the Papists, which divides the
   work of perseverance in holiness between man's free will and God's
   grace, [114] precipitates wretched souls into destruction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [111] Horsley reads, "I shall be added,' or made an addition;'
   literally, be-made-to-be-added to the sum of thy praise.'" "The sense
   is," says he, "that the mercies to the Psalmist would furnish the
   servants of God with a new topic of praise and thanksgiving."

   [112] The present reading of the Septuagint is, Ouk egnon pragmateias,
   "I know not the affairs of men;" but Nobilius, in his Notes on the
   Septuagint, observes, that in some Greek copies it is, grammateias,
   "learning," of which reading Augustine makes mention; and as the
   Vulgate reads, "literaturam," "learning," this makes it more probable
   that the ancient reading of the LXX. was not pragmateias, but
   grammateias. Horsley has followed the LXX. He considers this clause as
   the commencement of a new sentence, and connects it with the 16th verse
   thus: -- "Although I am no proficient in learning;
   I will enter upon [the subject of] the Lord Jehovah's great might;
   I will commemorate thy righteousness." In a foot-note he refers to John
   7:15, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" and to
   Matthew 13:54, 56; and in an additional note he says, "It is strange
   that Houbigant should treat an interpretation with contempt, which is
   supported by the versions of the LXX., Jerome, and the Vulgate; which
   the Hebrew words will naturally bear, and which gives great spirit to
   the sentiment." Street reads: -- "Though I am ignorant of books,
   I will proceed with strength," etc.; and observes, that "The word msphr
   signifies number, but sphr, signifies an epistle, a book."

   [113] "Expertes." -- Lat. "Gros asniers. -- Fr.

   [114] That is, which represents this work as performed, partly by God,
   and partly by a power which man has in himself underived from God.

   Psalm 71:17-19

   17. O God! thou hast taught me from my youth; and hitherto will I
   announce thy wondrous works. 18. And still, O God! when I am old and
   grey-headed, forsake me not, until I declare thy strength to the
   generation, and thy power to all who are to come. 19. And thy
   righteousness, O God! Is very high: for thou hast done great things: O
   God! who is like thee?


   17. O God! thou hast taught me from my youth. The Psalmist again
   declares the great obligations under which he lay to God for his
   goodness, not only with the view of encouraging himself to gratitude,
   but also of exciting himself to continue cherishing hope for the time
   to come: which will appear from the following verse. Besides, since God
   teaches us both by words and deeds, it is certain that the second
   species of teaching is here referred to, the idea conveyed being, that
   David had learned by continual experience, even from his infancy, that
   nothing is better than to lean exclusively upon the true God. That he
   may never be deprived of this practical truth, he testifies that he had
   made great proficiency in it. When he promises to become a publisher of
   God's wondrous works, his object in coming under this engagement is,
   that by his ingratitude he may not interrupt the course of the Divine
   beneficence.

   Upon the truth here stated, he rests the prayer which he presents in
   the 18th verse, that he may not be forgotten in his old age. His
   reasoning is this: Since thou, O God! hast from the commencement of my
   existence given me such abundant proofs of thy goodness, wilt thou not
   stretch forth thy hand to succor me, when now thou seest me decaying
   through the influence of old age? And, indeed, the conclusion is
   altogether inevitable, that as God vouchsafed to love us when we were
   infants, and embraced us with his favor when we were children, and has
   continued without intermission to do us good during the whole course of
   our life, he cannot but persevere in acting toward us in the same way
   even to the end. Accordingly, the particle gm, gam, which we have
   translated still, here signifies therefore; it being David's design,
   from the consideration that the goodness of God can never be exhausted,
   and that he is not mutable like men, to draw the inference that he will
   be the same towards his people in their old age, that he was towards
   them in their childhood. He next supports his prayer by another
   argument, which is, that if he should fail or faint in his old age, the
   grace of God, by which he had been hitherto sustained, would at the
   same time soon be lost sight of. If God were immediately to withdraw
   his grace from us after we have but just tasted it slightly, it would
   speedily vanish from our memory. In like manner, were he to forsake us
   at the close of our life, after having conferred upon us many benefits
   during the previous part of it, his liberality by this means would be
   divested of much of its interest and attraction. David therefore
   beseeches God to assist him even to the end, that he may be able to
   commend to posterity the unintermitted course of the Divine goodness,
   and to bear testimony, even at his very death, that God never
   disappoints the faithful who betake themselves to him. By the
   generation and those who are to come, he means the children and the
   children's children to whom the memorial of the loving-kindness of God
   cannot be transmitted unless it be perfect in all respects, and has
   completed its course. He mentions strength and power as the effects of
   God's righteousness. He is, however, to be understood by the way as
   eulogising by these titles the manner of his deliverance, in which he
   congratulates himself; as if he had said, that God, in the way in which
   it was accomplished, afforded a manifestation of matchless and
   all-sufficient power.

   19. And thy righteousness, O God! is very high. [115] Some connect this
   verse with the preceding, and repeating the verb I will declare, as
   common to both verses, translate, And I will declare thy righteousness,
   O God! But this being a matter of small importance, I will not dwell
   upon it. David prosecutes at greater length the subject of which he had
   previously spoken. In the first place, he declares that the
   righteousness of God is very high; secondly, that it wrought mightily;
   and, finally, he exclaims in admiration, Who is like thee? It is worthy
   of notice, that the righteousness of God, the effects of which are near
   to us and conspicuous, is yet placed on high, inasmuch as it cannot be
   comprehended by our finite understanding. Whilst we measure it
   according to our own limited standard, we are overwhelmed and swallowed
   up by the smallest temptation. In order, therefore, to give it free
   course to save us, it behoves us to take a large and a comprehensive
   view -- to look above and beneath, far and wide, that we may form some
   due conceptions of its amplitude. The same remarks apply to the second
   clause, which makes mention of the works of God: For thou hast done
   great things. If we attribute to his known power the praise which is
   due to it, we will never want ground for entertaining good hope.
   Finally, our sense of the goodness of God should extend so far as to
   ravish us with admiration; for thus it will come to pass that our
   minds, which are often distracted by an unholy disquietude, will repose
   upon God alone. If any temptation thrusts itself upon us, we
   immediately magnify a fly into an elephant; or rather, we rear very
   high mountains, which keep the hand of God from reaching us; and at the
   same time we basely limit the power of God. The exclamation of David,
   then, Who is like thee? tends to teach us the lesson, that we should
   force our way through every impediment by faith, and regard the power
   of God, which is well entitled to be so regarded, as superior to all
   obstacles. All men, indeed, confess with the mouth, that none is like
   God; but there is scarce one out of a hundred who is truly and fully
   persuaded that He alone is sufficient to save us.

   Psalm 71:20-24

   20. Thou hast made me to see great and sore troubles, but turning, thou
   wilt quicken me, and turning [116] thou wilt lift me up from the deep
   places of the earth. [117] 21. Thou wilt multiply my greatness; and
   turning, thou wilt comfort me. 22. I will also, O my God: praise thee,
   for thy truth, with the psaltery; I will sing to thee with the harp, O
   Holy One of Israel! 23. My lips shall rejoice when I sing to thee; and
   my soul, which thou hast redeemed. 24. My tongue also shall daily
   declare thy righteousness: for they who seek my hurt are confounded and
   brought to shame.


   20. Thou hast made me to see great and sore troubles. The verb to see
   among the Hebrews, as is well known, is applied to the other senses
   also. Accordingly, when David complains that calamities had been shown
   to him, he means that he had suffered them. And as he attributes to God
   the praise of the deliverances which he had obtained, so he, on the
   other hand, acknowledges that whatever adversities he had endured were
   inflicted on him according to the counsel and will of God. But we must
   first consider the object which David has in view, which is to render
   by comparison the grace of God the more illustrious, in the way of
   recounting how hardly he had been dealt with. Had he always enjoyed a
   uniform course of prosperity, he would no doubt have had good reason to
   rejoice; but in that case he would not have experienced what it is to
   be delivered from destruction by the stupendous power of God. We must
   be brought down even to the gates of death before God can be seen to be
   our deliverer. As we are born without thought and understanding, our
   minds, during the earlier part of our life, are not sufficiently
   impressed with a sense of the Author of our existence; but when God
   comes to our help, as we are lying in a state of despair, this
   resurrection is to us a bright mirror from which is seen reflected his
   grace. In this way David amplifies the goodness of God, declaring, that
   though plunged in a bottomless abyss, he was nevertheless drawn out by
   the divine hand, and restored to the light. And he boasts not only of
   having been preserved perfectly safe by the grace of God, but of having
   also been advanced to higher honor -- a change which was, as it were,
   the crowning of his restoration, and was as if he had been lifted out
   of hell, even up to heaven. What he repeats the third time, with
   respect to God's turning, goes to the commendation of Divine
   Providence; the idea which he intends to be conveyed being, that no
   adversity happened to him by chance, as was evident from the fact that
   his condition was reversed as soon as the favor of God shone upon him.

   22. I will also, O my God! praise thee. He again breaks forth into
   thanksgiving; for he was aware that the design of God, in so liberally
   succouring his servants, is, that his goodness may be celebrated. In
   speaking of employing the psaltery and the harp in this exercise, he
   alludes to the generally prevailing custom of that time. To sing the
   praises of God upon the harp and psaltery unquestionably formed a part
   of the training of the law, and of the service of God under that
   dispensation of shadows and figures; but they are not now to be used in
   public thanksgiving. We are not, indeed, forbidden to use, in private,
   musical instruments, but they are banished out of the churches by the
   plain command of the Holy Spirit, when Paul, in 1 Corinthians 14:13,
   lays it down as an invariable rule, that we must praise God, and pray
   to him only in a known tongue. By the word truth, the Psalmist means
   that the hope which he reposed in God was rewarded, when God preserved
   him in the midst of dangers. The promises of God, and his truth in
   performing them, are inseparably joined together. Unless we depend upon
   the word of God, all the benefits which he confers upon us will be
   unsavoury or tasteless to us; nor will we ever be stirred up either to
   prayer or thanksgiving, if we are not previously illuminated by the
   Divine word. So much the more revolting, then, is the folly of that
   diabolical man, Servetus, who teaches that the rule of praying is
   perverted, if faith is fixed upon the promises; as if we could have any
   access into the presence of God, until he first invited us by his own
   voice to come to him.

   23. My lips shall rejoice [118] when I sing to thee. In this verse
   David expresses more distinctly his resolution not to give thanks to
   God hypocritically, nor in a superficial manner, but to engage with
   unfeigned earnestness in this religious exercise. By the figures which
   he introduces, he briefly teaches us, that to praise God would be the
   source of his greatest pleasure; and thus he indirectly censures the
   profane mirth of those who, forgetting God, confine their
   congratulations to themselves in their prosperity. The scope of the
   last verse is to the same effect, implying that no joy would be sweet
   and desirable to him, but such as was connected with the praises of
   God, and that to celebrate his Redeemer's praises would afford him the
   greatest satisfaction and delight.

   PSALM 72

   David in this psalm prays to God, in the name of the whole Church, for
   the continual prosperity of the kingdom which was promised him, and
   teaches us at the same time, that the true happiness of the godly
   consists in their being placed under the government of a king who was
   raised to the throne by the appointment of heaven.

   ¶ Of Solomon. [119]

   From the inscription of this psalm we cannot determine who was its
   author. As it is expressly said at the close to be the last of David's
   prayers, it is more probable that it was composed by him than by
   Solomon, his successor. [120] It may, however, be conjectured that
   Solomon reduced the prayer of his father into poetical measure, to make
   it more generally known, and to bring it more extensively into use
   among the people, -- a conjecture which is not improbable. But as the
   letter l, lamed, has many significations in Hebrew, it may be explained
   as denoting that this psalm was composed for or in behalf of Solomon.
   If this is admitted, it is to be observed, that under the person of one
   man there is comprehended the state of the kingdom through successive
   ages. After having carefully weighed the whole matter, I am disposed to
   acquiesce in the conjecture, that the prayers to which David gave
   utterance on his death-bed were reduced by his son into the form of a
   psalm, with the view of their being kept in everlasting remembrance. To
   indicate the great importance of this prayer, and to induce the
   faithful with the greater earnestness to unite their prayers with the
   memorable prayer of this holy king, it is expressly added, that this is
   the last which he poured forth. As Solomon did nothing more than throw
   into the style of poetry the matter to which his father gave
   expression, David is to be considered as the principal author of this
   inspired composition. Those who would interpret it simply as a prophecy
   of the kingdom of Christ, seem to put a construction upon the words
   which does violence to them; and then we must always beware of giving
   the Jews occasion of making an outcry, as if it were our purpose,
   sophistically, to apply to Christ those things which do not directly
   refer to him. But as David, who was anointed king by the commandment of
   God, knew that the terms upon which he and his posterity possessed the
   kingdom were, that the power and dominion should at length come to
   Christ; and as he farther knew that the temporal well-being of the
   people was, for the time, comprehended in this kingdom, as held by him
   and his posterity, and that from it, which was only a type or shadow,
   there should at length proceed something far superior -- that is,
   spiritual and everlasting felicity; knowing, as he did, all this, he
   justly made the perpetual duration of this kingdom the object of his
   most intense solicitude, and prayed with the deepest earnestness in its
   behalf, -- reiterating his prayer in his last moments, with the view of
   distinctly testifying, that of all his cares this was the greatest.
   What is here spoken of everlasting dominion cannot be limited to one
   man, or to a few, nor even to twenty ages; but there is pointed out the
   succession which had its end and its complete accomplishment in Christ.

   Psalm 72:1-6

   1. O God! give thy judgments to the king, and thy righteousness to the
   king's son. 2. He shall judge thy people in righteousness, and thy poor
   ones in judgment. 3. The mountains shall bring forth peace to the
   people, and the hills in righteousness. [121] 4. He shall judge the
   poor of the people; he shall save the children of the afflicted; and
   shall break in pieces the calumniator. 5. They shall fear thee with the
   sun; and generation of generations shall fear thee [122] in the
   presence of the moon. 6. He shall descend as rain upon the mown grass;
   as the showers [123] which water the earth.


   1. O God! give thy judgments to the king. [124] While David, to whom
   the promise had been made, at his death affectionately recommended to
   God his son, who was to succeed him in his kingdom, he doubtless
   endited to the Church a common form of prayer, that the faithful,
   convinced of the impossibility of being prosperous and happy, except
   under one head, should show all respect, and yield all obedience to
   this legitimate order of things, and also that from this typical
   kingdom they might be conducted to Christ. In short, this is a prayer
   that God would furnish the king whom he had chosen with the spirit of
   uprightness and wisdom. By the terms righteousness and judgment, the
   Psalmist means a due and well-regulated administration of government,
   which he opposes to the tyrannical and unbridled license of heathen
   kings, who, despising God, rule according to the dictates of their own
   will; and thus the holy king of Israel, who was anointed to his office
   by divine appointment, is distinguished from other earthly kings. From
   the words we learn by the way, that no government in the world can be
   rightly managed but under the conduct of God, and by the guidance of
   the Holy Spirit. If kings possessed in themselves resources
   sufficiently ample, it would have been to no purpose for David to have
   sought by prayer from another, that with which they were of themselves
   already provided. But in requesting that the righteousness and judgment
   of God may be given to kings, he reminds them that none are fit for
   occupying that exalted station, except in so far as they are formed for
   it by the hand of God. Accordingly, in the Proverbs of Solomon,
   (Proverbs 8:15,) Wisdom proclaims that kings reign by her. Nor is this
   to be wondered at, when we consider that civil government is so
   excellent an institution, that God would have us to acknowledge him as
   its author, and claims to himself the whole praise of it. But it is
   proper for us to descend from the general to the particular; for since
   it is the peculiar work of God to set up and to maintain a rightful
   government in the world, it was much more necessary for him to
   communicate the special grace of his Spirit for the maintenance and
   preservation of that sacred kingdom which he had chosen in preference
   to all others. By the king's son David no doubt means his successors.
   At the same time, he has an eye to this promise:

   "Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne,"
   (Psalm 132:11.)

   But no such stability as is indicated in that passage is to be found in
   the successors of David, till we come to Christ. We know that after the
   death of Solomon, the dignity of the kingdom decayed, and from that
   time its wealth became impaired, until, by the carrying of the people
   into captivity, and the ignominious death inflicted upon their king,
   the kingdom was involved in total ruin. And even after their return
   from Babylon, their restoration was not such as to inspire them with
   any great hope, until at length Christ sprung forth from the withered
   stock of Jesse. He therefore holds the first rank among the children of
   David.

   2. He shall judge thy people in righteousness. Some read this in the
   form of a wish -- O that he may judge, etc. Others retain the future
   tense; and thus it is a prophecy. But we will come nearer the correct
   interpretation by understanding something intermediate, as implied. All
   that is afterwards spoken, concerning the king, flows from the
   supposition, that the blessing prayed for in the first verse is
   conferred upon him -- from the supposition that he is adorned with
   righteousness and judgment. The prayer, then, should be explained thus:
   Govern our king, O God! that he may judge. Or in this way, When thou
   shalt have bestowed upon the king thy righteousness, then he will judge
   uprightly. To govern a nation well, is an endowment far too excellent
   to grow out of the earth; but the spiritual government of Christ, by
   which all things are restored to perfect order, ought much more to be
   considered a gift of heaven. In the first clause of the verse, David
   speaks of the whole people in general. In the second clause, he
   expressly mentions the poor, who, on account of their poverty and
   weakness, have need of the help of others, and for whose sake kings are
   armed with the sword to grant them redress when unjustly oppressed.
   Hence, also, proceeds peace, of which mention is made in the third
   verse. The term peace being employed among the Hebrews to denote not
   only rest and tranquillity, but also prosperity, David teaches us that
   the people would enjoy prosperity and happiness, when the affairs of
   the nation were administered according to the principles of
   righteousness. The bringing forth of peace is a figurative expression
   taken from the fertility of the earth. [125] And when it is said that
   the mountains and hills shall bring forth peace, [126] the meaning is,
   that no corner would be found in the country in which it did not
   prevail, not even the most unpromising parts, indicated by the
   mountains, which are commonly barren, or at least do not produce so
   great an abundance of fruits as the valleys. Besides, both the word
   peace and the word righteousness are connected with each clause of the
   verse, and must be twice repeated, [127] the idea intended to be
   conveyed being, that peace by righteousness [128] should be diffused
   through every part of the world. Some read simply righteousness,
   instead of In righteousness, supposing the letter v, beth, to be here
   redundant, which does not, however, appear to be the case. [129]

   4. He shall judge the poor of the people. The poet continues his
   description of the end and fruit of a righteous government, and unfolds
   at greater length what he had briefly touched upon concerning the
   afflicted among the people. But it is a truth which ought to be borne
   in mind, that kings can keep themselves within the bounds of justice
   and equity only by the grace of God; for when they are not governed by
   the Spirit of righteousness proceeding from heaven, their government is
   converted into a system of tyranny and robbery. As God had promised to
   extend his care to the poor and afflicted among his people, David, as
   an argument to enforce the prayer which he presents in behalf of the
   king, shows that the granting of it will tend to the comfort of the
   poor. God is indeed no respecter of persons; but it is not without
   cause that God takes a more special care of the poor than of others,
   since they are most exposed to injuries and violence. Let laws and the
   administration of justice be taken away, and the consequence will be,
   that the more powerful a man is, he will be the more able to oppress
   his poor brethren. David, therefore, particularly mentions that the
   king will be the defender of those who can only be safe under the
   protection of the magistrate, and declares that he will be their
   avenger when they are made the victims of injustice and wrong. The
   phrase, The children of the afflicted, is put for the afflicted, an
   idiom quite common in Hebrew, and a similar form of expression is
   sometimes used by the Greeks, as when they say huious iatron, the sons
   of physicians, for physicians. [130] But as the king cannot discharge
   the duty of succouring and defending the poor which David imposes upon
   him, unless he curb the wicked by authority and the power of the sword,
   it is very justly added in the end of the verse, that when
   righteousness reigns, oppressors or extortioners will be broken in
   pieces. It would be foolish to wait till they should give place of
   their own accord. They must be repressed by the sword, that their
   audacity and wickedness may be prevented from proceeding to greater
   lengths. It is therefore requisite for a king to be a man of wisdom,
   and resolutely prepared effectually to restrain the violent and
   injurious, that the rights of the meek and orderly may be preserved
   unimpaired. Thus none will be fit for governing a people but he who has
   learned to be rigorous when the case requires. Licentiousness must
   necessarily prevail under an effeminate and inactive sovereign, or even
   under one who is of a disposition too gentle and forbearing. There is
   much truth in the old saying, that it is worse to live under a prince
   through whose lenity everything is lawful, than under a tyrant where
   there is no liberty at all.

   5. They shall fear thee with the sun If this is read as an apostrophe,
   or change of person, it may be properly and without violence understood
   of the king; implying, that the ornaments or distinctions which chiefly
   secure to a sovereign reverence from his subjects are his impartially
   securing to every man the possession of his own rights, and his
   manifesting a spirit of humanity ready at all times to succor the poor
   and miserable, as well as a spirit determined rigorously to subdue the
   audacity of the wicked. But it will be more appropriate, without
   changing the person, to explain it of God himself. [131] The
   preservation of mutual equity among men is an inestimable blessing; but
   the service of God is well worthy of being preferred even to this.
   David, therefore, very properly commends to us the blessed fruits of a
   holy and righteous government, by telling us that it will draw in its
   train true religion and the fear of God. And Paul, when enjoining us in
   1 Timothy 2:2, to pray for kings, expressly mentions what we ought to
   have in view in our prayers, which is, "that we may lead a quiet and
   peaceable life in all godliness and honesty." As there is no small
   danger, were civil government overthrown, of religion being destroyed,
   and the worship of God annihilated, David beseeches God to have respect
   to his own name and glory in preserving the king. By this argument he
   at once reminds kings of their duty, and stirs up the people to prayer;
   for we cannot be better employed than in directing all our desires and
   prayers to the advancement of the service and honor of God. When we
   come to Christ, this is far more truly applicable to him, true religion
   being established in his kingdom and nowhere else. And certainly David,
   in describing the worship or service of God as continuing to the end of
   the world, intimates by the way that he ascends in thought to that
   everlasting kingdom which God had promised: They shall fear thee with
   the sun; and generation of generations shall fear thee in the presence
   of the moon. [132]

   6. He shall descend as the rain upon the mown grass. This comparison
   may seem at first sight to be somewhat harsh; but it elegantly and
   appositely expresses the great advantage which is derived by all from
   the good and equitable constitution of a kingdom. Meadows, we know, are
   cut in the beginning of summer when the heat prevails; and did not the
   earth imbibe new moisture by the falling rain, even the very roots of
   the herbage would wither by reason of the barren and parched state of
   the soil. David, therefore, teaches us that as God defends the earth
   from the heat of the sun by watering it, so he in like manner provides
   for the welfare of his Church, and defends it under the government of
   the king. But this prediction has received its highest fulfillment in
   Christ, who, by distilling upon the Church his secret grace, renders
   her fruitful.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [121] In the Septuagint, in righteousness is connected with the
   following verse -- In righteousness he shall judge the poor of the
   people," Dr Adam Clarke considers this to be the true division.

   [122] "Te craindra," "shall fear thee," is a supplement in the French
   version. There is no supplement in the Latin version.

   [123] "Comme les pluyes drues et longues." -- Fr. "As the plenteous and
   prolonged showers."

   [124] "In other places, those events which God himself brings to pass
   in defending the righteous, and in punishing the wicked, are called his
   judgments, as in Psalm 36:7; but the statutes promulgated by God for
   the regulation of human conduct are also styled his judgments. In this
   sense, the judgments and laws of God may be considered as synonymous
   terms, Psalm 119. 20, 30, 39, 52, 75. The clause is justly explained by
   Jarchi: Knowledge of the judgments -- to wit, of the particular rules
   of right -- which thou hast commanded in the law.' The explication
   given by Kimchi is suitable also: That he may not err in giving forth
   sentences, give him knowledge and understanding, that he may judge with
   judgment and justice.'" -- Rosenmüller on the Messianic Psalms,
   Biblical Cabinet, volume 32, pp. 232, 233.

   [125] As the earth brings forth fruits, so shall the mountains bring
   forth peace. The same figure is used in Psalm 85:12, where it is said,
   "Truth shall spring out of the earth."

   [126] Dathe and Boothroyd take another view. According to them, the
   allusion is to the custom which, in ancient times, prevailed in the
   East, of announcing good or bad news from the tops of mountains, or
   other eminences; by means of which, acts of justice were speedily
   communicated to the remotest part of the country. The same image is
   used in Isaiah 40:9.

   [127] That is, we are to read thus: "The mountains shall bring forth
   peace to the people in righteousness; and the hills shall bring forth
   peace to the people in righteousness."

   [128] "Peace by righteousness." Calvin considers the Psalmist as
   representing peace to be the native fruit or effect of righteousness.
   Such also is the interpretation of Rosenmüller: "And the hills shall
   bring forth peace with justice, or because of justice.' Justice and
   peace are joined together, as cause and effect. When iniquity or
   injustice prevails, general misery is the consequence; and, on the
   contrary, the prevalence of justice is followed by general felicity.
   The sense of the clause is, -- happiness shall reign throughout the
   land, for the people shall be governed with equity."

   [129] Rosenmüller, in like manner, objects to this reading. "Some
   expositors," says he, "consider the prefix v, beth, as redundant, or as
   denoting that the noun is in the accusative case; and that the clause
   may be rendered, And the hills shall bring forth justice Noldius, in
   his Concordance, adduces several passages as examples of a similar
   construction; but they appear, all of them, to be constructed on a
   different principle."

   [130] Many examples of this Hebraism might be quoted. In Ecclesiastes
   10:17, "a son of nobles" is put for "a noble person;" in Psalm 18:45,
   children of the stranger, for strangers; and, in many passages,
   children, or sons of men, for men, simply considered.

   [131] "The poet in this clause addresses God; not the king, of whom he
   speaks always in the third person. The sense is, This king shall
   establish and preserve among his subjects the true religion, -- the
   uncorrupted worship of God. Michaelis, on this passage, justly remarks
   that this could not, without extreme flattery, be predicated of
   Solomon." -- Dathe.

   [132] "With the sun," and "in the presence of the moon," are Hebrew
   idioms, designating the eternity of the Messiah's kingdom. "They shall
   venerate thee with the sun, and in presence of the moon;' that is, as
   long as the sun shines, and is succeeded by the moon, or while the sun
   and moon continue to give light, -- in a word, for ever. Compare verse
   seventh, where the same idea is expressed, only in a slightly different
   manner, -- until there be no moon Psalm 89:37 -- His throne shall be as
   the sun before me, as the moon it shall be established for ever.' The
   word lphny, [translated in presence of,] in this passage, is to be
   understood in the same sense as in Genesis 11:28, Mortuus est Haran,
   l-phny,coram facie Terah; And Haran died before the face of Terah,'
   that is, while Terah still survived. Hence, in Psalm 102:28, where
   lphnyk, coram te, before thee,' is used in reference to God, -- the
   Alexandrine version gives eis aionas for ever.' Here the sense is given
   in the words immediately following, dvr dvrym, generatio generationum,
   a generation of generations' shall venerate thee; -- in other words,
   throughout all generations, or during a continual series of years, men
   shall celebrate thy happy and glorious reign." -- Rosenmüller Calvin
   also reads dvr dvrym, "generation of generations," in the nominative
   case. The translators of our English Bible supply the preposition l,
   lamed, thus making it, "throughout all generations." But in either case
   the meaning is the same.

   Psalm 72:7-11

   7. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and there shall be
   abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth. [133] 8. He shall
   have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the
   earth. 9. The inhabitants of the desert shall bow before him; and his
   enemies shall lick the dust. 10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
   shall bring a present: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring a gift
   to him. 11. And all kings shall prostrate themselves before him; all
   nations shall serve him.


   7. In his days shall the righteous flourish It is unnecessary for me
   frequently to repeat what I have once stated, that all these sentences
   depend upon the first verse. David, therefore, prayed that the king
   might be adorned with righteousness and judgment, that the just might
   flourish and the people prosper. This prediction receives its highest
   fulfillment in Christ. It was, indeed, the duty of Solomon to maintain
   the righteous; but it is the proper office of Christ to make men
   righteous. He not only gives to every man his own, but also reforms
   their hearts through the agency of his Spirit. By this means he brings
   righteousness back, as it were, from exile, which otherwise would be
   altogether banished from the world. Upon the return of righteousness
   there succeeds the blessing of God, by which he causes all his children
   to rejoice in the way of making them to perceive that under their King,
   Christ, every provision is made for their enjoying all manner of
   prosperity and felicity. If any would rather take the word peace in its
   proper and more restricted signification, I have no objections to it.
   And, certainly, to the consummation of a happy life, nothing is more
   desirable than peace; for amidst the turmoils and contentions of war,
   men derive almost no good from having an abundance of all things, as it
   is then wasted and destroyed. Moreover, when David represents the life
   of the king as prolonged to the end of the world, this shows more
   clearly that he not only comprehends his successors who occupied an
   earthly throne, but that he ascends even to Christ, who, by rising from
   the dead, obtained for himself celestial life and glory, that he might
   govern his Church for ever.

   8 He shall have dominion from sea to sea. As the Lord, when he promised
   his people the land of Canaan for an inheritance, assigned to it these
   four boundaries, (Genesis 15:18,) David intimates, that so long as the
   kingdom shall continue to exist, the possession of the promised land
   will be entire, to teach the faithful that the blessing of God cannot
   be fully realised, except whilst this kingdom shall flourish. He
   therefore declares that he will exercise dominion from the Red Sea, or
   from that arm of the Egyptian sea to the sea of Syria, which is called
   the Sea of the Philistines, [134] and also from the river Euphrates to
   the great wilderness. If it is objected that such narrow bounds do not
   correspond with the kingdom of Christ, which was to be extended from
   the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, we reply, that David
   obviously accommodates his language to his own time, the amplitude of
   the kingdom of Christ not having been, as yet, fully unfolded. He has
   therefore begun his description in phraseology well known, and in
   familiar use under the law and the prophets; and even Christ himself
   commenced his reign within the limits here marked out before he
   penetrated to the uttermost boundaries of the earth; as it is said in
   Psalm 110:2,

   "The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion."

   But, soon after, the Psalmist proceeds to speak of the enlarged extent
   of the empire of this king, declaring that the kings beyond the sea
   shall also be tributaries to him; and also that the inhabitants of the
   desert shall receive his yoke. The word tsyym, tsiim, [135] which we
   have translated inhabitants of the desert, is, I have no doubt, to be
   understood of those who, dwelling towards the south, were at a great
   distance from the land of Canaan. The Prophet immediately adds, that
   the enemies of the king shall lick the dust in token of their
   reverence. This, as is well known, was in ancient times a customary
   ceremony among the nations of the East; and Alexander the Great, after
   he had conquered the East, wished to compel his subjects to practice
   it, from which arose great dissatisfaction and contentions, the
   Macedonians disdainfully refusing to yield such a slavish and degrading
   mark of subjection. [136] The meaning then is, that the king chosen by
   God in Judea will obtain so complete a victory over all his enemies,
   far and wide, that they shall come humbly to pay him homage.

   10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents. The
   Psalmist still continues, as in the preceding verse, to speak of the
   extent of the kingdom. The Hebrews apply the appellation of Tarshish to
   the whole coast, which looks towards Cilicia. By the isles, therefore,
   is denoted the whole coast of the Mediterranean Sea, from Cilicia to
   Greece. As the Jews, contenting themselves with the commodities of
   their own country, did not undertake voyages to distant countries, like
   other nations; God having expressly required them to confine themselves
   within the limits of their own country, that they might not be
   corrupted by the manners of strangers; they were accustomed, in
   consequence of this, to apply the appellation of isles to those
   countries which were on the other side of the sea. I indeed admit that
   Cyprus, Crete, and other islands, are comprehended under this name; but
   I also maintain that it applies to all the territories which were
   situated beyond the Mediterranean Sea. By the words mnchh, minchah, a
   present, and 'skr, eshcar, a gift, must be understood any tribute or
   custom, and not voluntary offerings; for it is vanquished enemies, and
   the mark or token of their subjection, which are spoken of. These terms
   appear to be used intentionally in this place, in order to mitigate the
   odium attached to such a mark of subjugation; [137] as if the inspired
   writer indirectly reproved subjects, if they defrauded their kings of
   their revenues. By sv', Sheba, some think Arabia is intended, and by
   sv', Seba, Ethiopia. Some, however, by the first word understand all
   that part of the Gulf of Arabia which lies towards Africa; and by the
   second, which is written with the letter s, samech, the country of
   Sabea, [138] the more pleasant and fruitful country. This opinion is
   probably the more correct of the two. It is unnecessary here to remark
   how foolishly this passage has been wrested in the Church of Rome. They
   chant this verse as referring to the philosophers or wise men who came
   to worship Christ; as if, indeed, it were in their power of
   philosophers to make kings all upon a sudden; and in addition to this,
   to change the quarters of the world, to make of the east the south or
   the west.

   11. And all kings shall prostrate themselves before him. This verse
   contains a more distinct statement of the truth, That the whole world
   will be brought in subjection to the authority of Christ. The kingdom
   of Judah was unquestionably never more flourishing than under the reign
   of Solomon; but even then there were only a small number of kings who
   paid tribute to him, and what they paid was inconsiderable in amount;
   and, moreover, it was paid upon condition that they should be allowed
   to live in the enjoyment of liberty under their own laws. While David
   then began with his own son, and the posterity of his son, he rose by
   the Spirit of prophecy to the spiritual kingdom of Christ; a point
   worthy of our special notice, since it teaches us that we have not been
   called to the hope of everlasting salvation by chance, but because our
   heavenly Father had already destined to give us to his Son. From this
   we also learn, that in the Church and flock of Christ there is a place
   for kings; whom David does not here disarm of their sword nor despoil
   of their crown, in order to admit them into the Church, but rather
   declares that they will come with all the dignity of their station to
   prostrate themselves at the feet of Christ.

   Psalm 72:12-15

   12. For he will deliver the poor when he crieth to him; and the
   afflicted person who hath none to succor him. 13. He will have pity on
   the poor and indigent; and will save the souls [or lives] of the poor.
   14. He will redeem their souls from fraud and violence: and their blood
   will be precious in his sight. 15. And he shall live; and there shall
   be given to him of the gold of Sheba; and prayer shall continually be
   made for him, and daily shall he be blessed.


   12. For he will deliver the poor when he crieth to him. The Psalmist
   again affirms that the kingdom which he magnifies so greatly will not
   be tyrannical or cruel. The majority of kings, neglecting the
   well-being of the community, have their minds wholly engrossed with
   their own private interests. The consequence is, that they unmercifully
   oppress their miserable subjects; and it even happens that the more
   formidable any of them is, and the more absorbing his rapacity, he is
   accounted so much the more eminent and illustrious. But it is far
   different with the king here described. It has been held as a proverb
   by all mankind, "That there is nothing in which men approach nearer to
   God than by their beneficence;" and it would be very inconsistent did
   not this virtue shine forth in those kings whom God has more nearly
   linked to himself. Accordingly, David, to render the king beloved who
   was chosen of God, justly declares, not only that he will be the
   guardian of justice and equity, but also that he will be so humane and
   merciful, as to be ready to afford succor to the most despised;
   qualities too seldom to be found in sovereigns, who, dazzled with their
   own splendor, withdraw themselves to a distance from the poor and the
   afflicted, as if it were unworthy of, and far beneath, their royal
   dignity to make them the objects of their care. David avows that the
   blood of the common people, which is usually accounted vile and as a
   thing of nought, will be very precious in the estimation of this
   heavenly king. Constancy and magnanimity are denoted by the words he
   will redeem; for it would be far short of the duty of a king merely to
   hate fraud and extortion, did he not resolutely come forward to punish
   these crimes and set himself to defend those who are oppressed. [139]
   Under the terms fraud and violence is comprehended all kind of
   wrong-doing; for a man in working mischief is either a lion or a fox.
   Some rage with open violence, and others proceed to wrong-doing
   insidiously and by secret arts. Moreover, we know that supreme
   sovereignty, both in heaven and earth, has been given to Christ,
   (Matthew 28:18,) that he may defend his people not only from all
   temporal dangers, but especially from all the harassing annoyances of
   Satan, until having delivered them at length from all trouble, he
   gather them into the everlasting rest of his heavenly kingdom.

   15. And he shall live. To refer the word live to the poor, as some do,
   seems forced. What David affirms is, that this king shall be rewarded
   with long life, which is not the least of God's earthly blessings. The
   words which follow are to be read indefinitely, that is to say, without
   determining any particular person; [140] as if it had been said, The
   gold of Arabia shall be given him, and prayers shall everywhere be made
   for his prosperity. There is thus again a repetition of what had been
   previously said concerning his power; for if Arabia shall pay him
   tribute, how vast an amount of riches will be gathered from so many
   countries nearer home! Christ, it is true, does not reign to hoard up
   gold, but David meant to teach by this figure, that even the nations
   which were most remote would yield such homage to him, as to surrender
   to him themselves and all that they possessed. It is no uncommon thing
   for the glory of the spiritual kingdom of Christ to be portrayed under
   images of outward splendor. David, in conformity with this usual style
   of Scripture, has here foretold that the kingdom of Christ would be
   distinguished for its wealth; but this is to be understood as referring
   to its spiritual character. Whence it appears how wickedly and wantonly
   the Papists have perverted this passage, and made it subserve their
   purpose of raking to themselves the perishable riches of the world.
   Moreover, when he speaks of the common prayers of the people, by which
   they will commend the prosperity of the king to the care of God, he
   intimates that so well-pleased will they be with being his subjects,
   that they will account nothing so desirable as to yield entire
   submission to his authority. Many, no doubt, reject his yoke, and
   hypocrites fret and murmur secretly in their hearts, and would gladly
   extinguish all remembrance of Christ, were it in their power; but the
   affectionate interest here predicted is what all true believers are
   careful to cultivate, not only because to pray for earthly kings is a
   duty enjoined upon them in the Word of God, but also because they ought
   to feel a special desire and solicitude for the enlargement of the
   boundaries of this kingdom, in which both the majesty of God shines
   forth, and their own welfare and happiness are included. Accordingly,
   in Psalm 118:25, we will find a form of prayer dictated for the whole
   Church, That God would bless this king; not that Christ stands in need
   of our prayers, but because he justly requires from his servants this
   manifestation or proof of true piety; and by it they may also exercise
   themselves in praying for the coming of the kingdom of God.

   Psalm 72:16-20

   16. A handful of corn shall be in the earth upon the top of the
   mountains; the fruit thereof shall be shaken as of Lebanon: [141] and
   they shall go forth from the city as it were a plant of the earth. 17.
   His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued in the
   presence of the sun: and all nations shall bless themselves in him, and
   shall call him blessed. 18. Blessed be Jehovah God! the God of Israel!
   who alone doeth wonderful things. 19. And blessed be his glorious name
   [literally, the name of his glory] for ever; and let all the earth be
   filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen. 20. The prayers of David the son
   of Jesse are ended.


   16. A handful of corn shall be [142] in the earth upon the top of the
   mountains. The opinion of those who take a handful [143] for a small
   portion appears to be well founded. They think that by the two
   circumstances here referred to, a rare and uncommon fertility is
   indicated. Only a very small quantity of wheat, not even more than a
   man can hold in the palm of his hand, has been sown, and that even upon
   the tops of the mountains, which generally are far from being fruitful;
   and yet so very abundant will be the increase, that the ears will wave
   and rustle in the winds as the trees on Lebanon. I do not, however,
   know whether so refined a comparison between seed-time and harvest is
   at all intended by David. His words may be considered more simply as
   denoting that so great will be the fertility, so abundant the produce
   of wheat which the mountain tops shall yield, that it may be reaped
   with full hand. By this figure is portrayed the large abundance of all
   good things which, through the blessing of God, would be enjoyed under
   the reign of Christ. To this is added the increase of children. Not
   only would the earth produce an abundance all kinds of fruits, but the
   cities and towns also would be fruitful in the production of men: And
   they shall go out [144] from the city as the grass of the earth I have
   preferred translating the word Lebanon in the genitive case instead of
   the nominative; for the metonomy of putting the name of the mountain,
   Lebanon, for the trees upon it, which is renounced by others, is
   somewhat harsh.

   17. His name shall endure for ever The inspired writer again repeats
   what he had previously affirmed concerning the perpetual duration of
   this kingdom. And he doubtless intended carefully to distinguish it
   from earthly kingdoms, which either suddenly vanish away, or at length,
   oppressed with their own greatness, fall into ruin, affording by their
   destruction incontestible evidence that nothing in this world is stable
   and of long duration. When he says that his name shall endure for ever,
   it is not to be understood as merely implying that his fame should
   survive his death, as worldly men are ambitious that their name may not
   be buried with their body. He is rather speaking of the kingdom when he
   says that the name of this prince will continue illustrious and
   glorious for ever. Some explain the words lphny-sms, liphney-shemesh,
   which we have rendered, in the presence of the sun, as if he meant that
   the glory with which God would invest the kings of Judah would surpass
   the brightness of the sun; but this is at variance with the context,
   for he had said above, (verse 5th,) in the same sense, with the sun,
   and in the presence of the moon.

   After having, therefore, made mention of the everlasting duration of
   the name of this king, he subjoins, by way of explanation, his name
   shall be continued in the presence of the sun Literally it is, his name
   shall have children, [145] (for the Hebrew verb is derived from the
   noun for son,) that is to say, it shall be perpetuated from father to
   son; [146] and as the sun rises daily to enlighten the world, so shall
   the strength of this king be continually renewed, and thus will
   continue from age to age for ever. In like manner, we shall afterwards
   see that the sun and the moon are called witnesses of the same
   eternity, (Psalm 89:38.) Whence it follows that this cannot be
   understood of the earthly kingdom, which flourished only for a short
   time in the house of David, and not only lost its vigor in the third
   successor, but was at length ignominiously extinguished. It properly
   applies to the kingdom of Christ; and although that kingdom often
   totters upon the earth when assailed with the furious hatred of the
   whole world, and battered by the most formidable engines of Satan, it
   is yet wonderfully upheld and sustained by God, that it may not
   altogether fail. The words which follow, All nations shall bless
   themselves in him, admit of a twofold meaning. The Hebrews often use
   this form of expression when the name of any man is used as an example
   or formula of prayer for blessings. For instance, a man blesses himself
   in David, who beseeches God to be as favorable and bountiful to him as
   he proved himself to be towards David. On the other hand, he is said to
   curse in Sodom and Gomorrah who employs the names of these cities by
   which to pronounce some curse. If, then, these two expressions, they
   shall bless themselves in him, and they shall call him blessed, are
   used in the same sense; the expression, to bless themselves in the
   king, will just mean to pray that the same prosperity may be conferred
   upon us which was conferred upon this highly favored king, whose happy
   condition will excite universal admiration. But if it is considered
   preferable to distinguish between these two expressions, (which is not
   less probable,) to bless one's self in the king, will denote to seek
   happiness from him; for the nations will be convinced that nothing is
   more desirable than to receive from him laws and ordinances.

   18. Blessed be Jehovah God! the God of Israel. [147] David, after
   having prayed for prosperity to his successors, breaks forth in
   praising God, because he was assured by the divine oracle that his
   prayers would not be in vain. Had he not with the eyes of faith beheld
   those things which we have seen above, his rejoicing would have been
   less free and lively. When he says that God alone doeth wonderful
   things, this, no doubt, is spoken in reference to the subject of which
   he is presently treating, with the view not only of commending the
   excellence of the kingdom, but also to admonish himself and others of
   the need which there is that God should display his wonderful and
   stupendous power for its preservation. And certainly it was not owing
   to any of David's successors, a few excepted, that the royal throne did
   not fall a hundred times, yea, was not even completely ruined. To go no
   farther, was not Solomon's most disgraceful apostasy deserving of utter
   destruction? And as to the rest of his successors, with the exception
   of Josias, Hezekiah, Jehoshaphat, and a few others, did they not fall
   from evil to worse, as if each strove to outstrip his predecessor, and
   thus so provoked the wrath of God, as it were deliberately, that it is
   wonderful that he did not immediately launch the thunderbolts of his
   vengeance upon the whole race utterly to destroy them? Moreover, as
   David, being endued with the Spirit of prophecy, was not ignorant that
   Satan would always continue to be a cruel enemy of the Church's
   welfare, he doubtless knew that the grace of God, of which he presently
   speaks, would have great and arduous difficulties to overcome in order
   to continue for ever in his own nation. And the event afterwards
   unquestionably showed by how many miracles God accomplished his
   promises, whether we consider the return of his people from the
   captivity of Babylon, or the astonishing deliverances which followed
   until Christ as a tender branch sprung out of a dead tree. David,
   therefore, with good reason prays that the glory of the divine name may
   fill the whole earth, since that kingdom was to be extended even to the
   uttermost boundaries of the globe, And that all the godly, with earnest
   and ardent affection of heart, may unite with him in the same prayers,
   there is added a confirmation in the words, Amen, and Amen

   20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. We have before
   observed that this was not without cause added by Solomon, (if we may
   suppose him to have put the matter of this psalm into the form of
   poetical compositions) not only that he might avoid defrauding his
   father of the praise which was due to him, but also to stir up the
   Church the more earnestly to pour forth before God the same prayers
   which David had continued to offer even with his last breath. Let us
   then remember that it is our bounden duty to pray to God, both with
   unfeigned earnestness, and with unwearied perseverance, that he would
   be pleased to maintain and defend the Church under the government of
   his Son. The name of Jesse, the father of David, seems to be here
   introduced to bring to remembrance David's origin, that the grace of
   God may appear the more illustrious in having raised from the sheepfold
   a man of mean birth, as well as the youngest and the least esteemed
   among his brethren, and in having advanced him to so high a degree of
   honor, as to make him king over the chosen people.

   [141] "Ou, le Leban." -- Fr. marg. "Or, Lebanon."

   [142] In the French version, the word semee, i.e., sown, is supplied.

   [143] The noun phsh, phissah, here translated handful, is found only in
   this passage. In explaining 1 Kings 18:44, the Chaldee interpreter, for
   the Hebrew words rendered "as a man's hand," has kphst yd, ke-phissath
   yad, which strictly signify, "as if a part of the hand." On this
   authority several expositors, along with Calvin, have understood phsh,
   phissah, as signifying "a small quantity of corn," as much as may lie
   on a man's hand, or as he may hold within it. And some at the beginning
   of the verse supply the conditional particle 'm, im, if But Rosenmüller
   thinks that "others with more propriety consider the noun phsh as
   having the same signification as phsyvn, diffusio, uberitas, spreading
   abroad, plenty,' and as derived from the verb phs', which, both in the
   Chaldee and in the Arabic, means expandit, diffudit se, he spread
   abroad, he enlarged himself.' The Syriac interpreter had, no doubt,
   this sense in view, when he rendered the words multitudinem frumenti,
   an abundance of corn.'"

   [144] The word tsyph, tsits, which Calvin renders shall go out,
   signifies to spring from, to spring up It is used, says Rosenmüller,
   with respect to plants or herbs when, sprouting from the seed, they
   make their appearance above ground in beauty and gracefulness, (Numbers
   17:8 .) It is used to denote also the reproduction of mankind in
   prosperous circumstances, (Isaiah 27:6.) From the noun myr, [from the
   city,] we are at no loss to supply the proper nominative to the
   preceding verb; q d., ex civitatibus singulis cives efflorescent, from
   the cities severally, the citizens shall spring forth.' The expression
   is somewhat similar to that in Psalm 68:27, where the descendants of
   Israel are said to be from the fountain of Israel." The extraordinary
   fertility and great increase of population here predicted took place in
   Palestine under the reign of Solomon, as is evident from 1 Kings 4:20,
   where it is said, that in the time of Solomon "Judah and Israel were
   many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking,
   and making merry." But this prophecy is destined to receive its fullest
   accomplishment under the reign of the Messiah.

   [145] "Filiabitur nomen ejus." -- Henry In the margin of our English
   Bibles it is, "He shall be as a son to continue his father's name."
   Bishop Patrick, therefore, paraphrases it, "His memory and fame shall
   never die, but be propagated from father to son, so long as the sun
   shall shine." Rosenmüller reads, "Sobolescet nomen ejus, his name shall
   increase,' that is, shall be continued as long as the sun endureth; the
   government shall continue to his posterity in perpetual succession."
   "The verb nvn, nun," he adds, "which occurs only in this passage, is
   explained from the noun nyn, nin, Genesis 21:23; Job 18:19; Isaiah
   14:22. In these passages the word has obviously the meaning of
   offspring, and by the Chaldee interpreters, it is constantly rendered
   by the word vr, bar, falius, a son.' It may, therefore, be assumed with
   certainty, that the verb nvn, nun, signifies sobolem procreare, to
   procreate descendants.' It may, however, be added, that the Alexandrine
   has here diamenei, a rendering in which both the Vulgate and Jerome
   concur: perseverabit nomen ejus,' his name shall endure." Dathe takes
   this last mentioned view. He supposes, that instead of ynvn, yinnon, we
   should read ykvn, yikon, stabilietur, -- permanebit; "shall be
   established, -- shall continue." "The verb nvn, nun," says he, "is not
   met with either in the Hebrew or in the cognate tongues, and is
   explained, -- merely by conjecture, -- augescere -- sobolescere, -- to
   increase or multiply,' because, as a noun in some of the dialects, it
   signifies a fish In the Septuagint the word is rendered diamenei; in
   the Vulgate and by Jerome, perseverabit; in the Chaldee, praeparatum
   est; in the Syriac, existet nomen ejus All these, without doubt, read
   ykvn, yikon, prepared, -- established, -- fixed,' -- the word which we
   find in the parallel passage, Psalm 89:38. The letters k, caph, and n,
   nun, it is evident, may very easily be interchanged from their
   similarity in form."

   Fils,) c'est a dire, sera perpetue de pere en fils." -- Fr.

   [147] This psalm concludes the second book of the Psalms, and this and
   the following verse are a doxology similar to that with which the first
   book and the other three are concluded. See [9]volume 2, p. 126, note.

   [120] To this it may be added, as Dathe observes, that "Solomon could
   not, without the imputation of vanity, have predicted in such strains
   the glory of his reign, the admiration with which he would be regarded
   by other nations, and the happiness of his subjects, arising from his
   prudence and virtue." The same writer adds, "But while David, or the
   inspired author, whoever he was, predicted the prosperity of Solomon's
   reign, the promise given (2 Samuel 7) of that greatest and best of
   kings, who was afterwards to arise in the family of David, seems to
   have been brought before his mind. This is the reason that the
   description given is, in various respects, more suited to the reign of
   the Messiah than to the reign of Solomon."

   PSALM 73

   David, or whoever may have been the author of this psalm, contending as
   it were against the judgment of carnal sense and reason, begins by
   extolling the righteousness and goodness of God. He next confesses that
   when he saw the wicked abounding in wealth, and living in the
   indulgence of every kind of pleasure, yea, even scornfully mocking God,
   and cruelly harassing the righteous, and that when he saw, on the other
   hand, how in proportion to the care with which any studied to practice
   uprightness, was the degree in which they were weighed down by troubles
   and calamities, and that in general all the children of God were pining
   away, and oppressed with cares and sorrows, while God, as if sitting in
   heaven idle and unconcerned, did not interfere to remedy such a
   disordered state of matters; it gave him so severe a shock, as almost
   to dispose him to cast off all concern about religion and all fear of
   God. In the third place, he reproves his own folly in proceeding rashly
   and hastily to pronounce judgment, merely from a view of the present
   state of things, and shows the necessity of exercising patience, that
   our faith may not fail under these troubles and disquietudes. At last
   he concludes that, provided we leave the providence of God to take its
   own course, in the way which he has determined in his secret purpose,
   [148] in the end, matters will assume a very different aspect, and it
   will be seen, that, on the one hand, the righteous are not defrauded of
   their reward, and that, on the other, the wicked do not escape the hand
   of the judge.

   A Psalm of Asaph.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 73:1-3

   1. Yet God is good to Israel, to those who are right of heart. 2. As
   for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped. 3.
   For I envied the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.


   As to the author of this psalm, I am not disposed to contend very
   strongly, although I think it probable that the name of Asaph was
   prefixed to it because the charge of singing it was committed to him,
   while the name of David, its author, was omitted, just as it is usual
   for us, when things are well known of themselves, not to be at the
   trouble of stating them. How much profit we may derive from meditation
   upon the doctrine contained in this psalm, it is easy to discover from
   the example of the prophet, who, although he had been exercised in no
   ordinary degree in true godliness, yet had great difficulty in keeping
   his footing, while reeling to and fro on the slippery ground on which
   he found himself placed. Nay, he acknowledges that, before he returned
   to such soundness of mind as enabled him to form a just judgment of the
   things which occasioned his trial, he had fallen into a state of almost
   brutish stupidity. As to ourselves, experience shows how slight
   impressions we have of the providence of God. We no doubt all agree in
   admitting that the world is governed by the hand of God; but were this
   truth deeply rooted in our hearts, our faith would be distinguished by
   far greater steadiness and perseverance in surmounting the temptations
   with which we are assailed in adversity. But when the smallest
   temptation which we meet with dislodges this doctrine from our minds,
   it is manifest that we have not yet been truly and in good earnest
   convinced of its truth.

   Besides, Satan has numberless artifices by which he dazzles our eyes
   and bewilders the mind; and then the confusion of things which prevails
   in the world produces so thick a mist, as to render it difficult for us
   to see through it, and to come to the conclusion that God governs and
   extends his care to things here below. The ungodly for the most part
   triumph; and although they deliberately stir up God to anger and
   provoke his vengeance, yet from his sparing them, it seems as if they
   had done nothing amiss in deriding him, and that they will never be
   called to account for it. [149] On the other hand, the righteous,
   pinched with poverty, oppressed with many troubles, harassed by
   multiplied wrongs, and covered with shame and reproach, groan and sigh:
   and in proportion to the earnestness with which they exert themselves
   in endeavoring to do good to all men, is the liberty which the wicked
   have the effrontery to take in abusing their patience. When such is the
   state of matters, where shall we find the person who is not sometimes
   tempted and importuned by the unholy suggestion, that the affairs of
   the world roll on at random, and as we say, are governed by chance?
   [150] This unhallowed imagination has doubtless obtained complete
   possession of the minds of the unbelieving, who are not illuminated by
   the Spirit of God, and thereby led to elevate their thoughts to the
   contemplation of eternal life. Accordingly, we see the reason why
   Solomon declares, that since "all things come alike to all, and there
   is one event to the righteous and to the wicked," the hearts of the
   sons of men are full of impiety and contempt of God, (Ecclesiastes 9:2,
   3;) -- the reason is, because they do not consider that things
   apparently so disordered are under the direction and government of God.

   Some of the heathen philosophers discoursed upon, and maintained the
   doctrine of a Divine Providence; but it was evident from experience
   that they had notwithstanding no real and thorough persuasion of its
   truth; for when things fell out contrary to their expectation, they
   openly disavowed what they had previously professed. [151] Of this we
   have a memorable example in Brutus. We can hardly conceive of a man
   surpassing him in courage, and all who intimately knew him bore
   testimony to his distinguished wisdom. Being of the sect of the Stoic
   philosophers, he spake many excellent things in commendation of the
   power and providence of God; and yet when at length vanquished by
   Antony, he cried out, that whatever he had believed concerning virtue
   had no foundation in truth, but was the mere invention of men, and that
   all the pains taken to live honestly and virtuously was only so much
   lost labor, since fortune rules over all the affairs of mankind. Thus
   this personage, who was distinguished for heroic courage, and an
   example of wonderful resolution, in renouncing virtue, and under the
   name of it cursing God, shamefully fell away. Hence it is manifest, how
   the sentiments of the ungodly fluctuate with the fluctuation of events.
   And how can it be expected that the heathen, who are not regenerated by
   the Spirit of God, should be able to resist such powerful and violent
   assaults, when even God's own people have need of the special
   assistance of his grace to prevent the same temptation from prevailing
   in their hearts, and when they are sometimes shaken by it and ready to
   fall; even as David here confesses, that his steps had well nigh
   slipped? But let us now proceed to the consideration of the words of
   the psalm.

   1. Yet God is good to Israel. The adverb 'k, [152] ach, does not here
   imply a simple affirmation certainly, as it often does in other places,
   but is taken adversatively for yet, notwithstanding, or some similar
   word. David opens the psalm abruptly; and from this we learn, what is
   worthy of particular notice, that before he broke forth into this
   language, his mind had been agitated with many doubts and conflicting
   suggestions. As a brave and valiant champion, he had been exercised in
   very painful struggles and temptations; but, after long and arduous
   exertion, he at length succeeded in shaking off all perverse
   imaginations, and came to the conclusion that yet God is gracious to
   his servants, and the faithful guardian of their welfare. Thus these
   words contain a tacit contrast between the unhallowed imaginations
   suggested to him by Satan, and the testimony in favor of true religion
   with which he now strengthens himself, denouncing, as it were, the
   judgment of the flesh, in giving place to misgiving thoughts with
   respect to the providence of God. We see then how emphatic is this
   exclamation of the Psalmist. He does not ascend into the chair to
   dispute after the manner of the philosophers, and to deliver his
   discourse in a style of studied oratory; but, as if he had escaped from
   hell, he proclaims, with a loud voice, and with impassioned feeling,
   that he had obtained the victory. To teach us by his own example the
   difficulty and arduousness of the conflict, he opens, so to speak, his
   heart and bowels, and would have us to understand something more than
   is expressed by the words which he employs. The amount of his language
   is, that although God, to the eye of sense and reason, may seem to
   neglect his servants, yet he always embraces them with his favor. He
   celebrates the providence of God, especially as it is extended towards
   genuine saints; to show them, not only that they are governed by God in
   common with other creatures, but that he watches over their welfare
   with special care, even as the master of a family carefully provides
   for and attends to his own household. God, it is true, governs the
   whole world; but he is graciously pleased to take a more close and
   peculiar inspection of his Church, which he has undertaken to maintain
   and defend.

   This is the reason why the prophet speaks expressly of Israel; and why
   immediately after he limits this name to those who are right of heart;
   which is a kind of correction of the first sentence; for many proudly
   lay claim to the name of Israel, as if they constituted the chief
   members of the Church, while they are but Ishmaelites and Edomites.
   David, therefore, with the view of blotting out from the catalogue of
   the godly all the degenerate children of Abraham, [153] acknowledges
   none to belong to Israel but such as purely and uprightly worship God;
   as if he had said, "When I declare that God is good to his Israel, I do
   not mean all those who, resting contented with a mere external
   profession, bear the name of Israelites, to which they have no just
   title; but I speak of the spiritual children of Abraham, who consecrate
   themselves to God with sincere affection of heart." Some explain the
   first clause, God is good to Israel, as referring to his chosen people;
   and the second clause, to those who are right of heart, as referring to
   strangers, to whom God would be gracious, provided they walked in true
   uprightness. But this is a frigid and forced interpretation. It is
   better to adhere to that which I have stated. David, in commending the
   goodness of God towards the chosen people and the Church, was under the
   necessity of cutting off from their number many hypocrites who had
   apostatised from the service of God, and were, therefore, unworthy of
   enjoying his fatherly favor. To his words corresponds the language of
   Christ to Nathanael, (John 1:47,) "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom
   is no guile!" As the fear of God among the Jews was at that time well
   nigh extinguished, and there remained among them almost nothing else
   but the "circumcision made with hands," that is to say, outward
   circumcision, Christ, to discriminate between the true children of
   Abraham and hypocrites, lays it down as a distinguishing characteristic
   of the former, that they are free from guile. And assuredly in the
   service of God, no qualification is more indispensable than uprightness
   of heart.

   2. As for me, etc. Literally, it is, And I: which ought to be read with
   emphasis; for David means that those temptations, which cast an affront
   upon the honor of God, and overwhelm faith, not only assail the common
   class of men, or those who are endued only with some small measure of
   the fear of God, but that he himself, who ought to have profited above
   all others in the school of God, had experienced his own share of them.
   By thus setting himself forth as an example, he designed the more
   effectually to arouse and incite us to take great heed to ourselves. He
   did not, it is true, actually succumb under the temptation; but, in
   declaring that his feet were almost gone, and that his steps had well
   nigh slipped, he warns us that all are in danger of falling, unless
   they are upheld by the powerful hand of God.

   3. For I envied the foolish [154] Here he declares the nature of the
   temptation with which he was assailed. It consisted in this, that when
   he saw the present prosperous state of the wicked, and from it judged
   them to be happy, he had envied their condition. We are certainly under
   a grievous and a dangerous temptation, when we not only, in our own
   minds, quarrel with God for not setting matters in due order, but also
   when we give ourselves loose reins, boldly to commit iniquity, because
   it seems to us that we may commit it, and yet escape with impunity. The
   sneering jest of Dionysius the younger, a tyrant of Sicily, when, after
   having robbed the temple of Syracuse, he had a prosperous voyage with
   the plunder, is well known. [155] "See you not," says he to those who
   were with him, "how the gods favor the sacrilegious?" In the same way,
   the prosperity of the wicked is taken as an encouragement to commit
   sin; for we are ready to imagine, that, since God grants them so much
   of the good things of this life, they are the objects of his
   approbation and favor. We see how their prosperous condition wounded
   David to the heart, leading him almost to think that there was nothing
   better for him than to join himself to their company, and to follow
   their course of life. [156] By applying to the ungodly the appellation
   of foolish, he does not simply mean that the sins which they commit are
   committed through ignorance or inadvertence, but he sets their folly in
   opposition to the fear of God, which is the principal constituent of
   true wisdom. [157] The ungodly are, no doubt, crafty; but, being
   destitute of the fundamental principle of all right judgment, which
   consists in this, that we must regulate and frame our lives according
   to the will of God, they are foolish; and this is the effect of their
   own blindness.

   Psalm 73:4-9

   4. For there are no bands to their death, and their strength is
   vigorous. [158] 5. They are not in the trouble that is common to man;
   neither are they scourged [or stricken] with other men. 6. Therefore
   pride compasseth them as a chain; the raiment of violence hath covered
   them. 7. Their eye goeth out for fatness; they have passed beyond [or
   exceeded] the thoughts of their heart. 8. They become insolent, and
   wickedly talk of extortion: [159] they speak from on high. 9. They have
   set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through
   the earth. [160]


   4 For there are no bands to their death. The Psalmist describes the
   comforts and advantages of the ungodly, which are as it were so many
   temptations to shake the faith of the people of God. He begins with the
   good health which they enjoy, telling us, that they are robust and
   vigorous, and have not to draw their breath with difficulty through
   continual sicknesses, as will often be the case with regard to true
   believers. [161] Some explain bands to death, as meaning delays,
   viewing the words as implying that the wicked die suddenly, and in a
   moment, not having to struggle with the pangs of dissolution. In the
   book of Job it is reckoned among the earthly felicities of the ungodly,
   That, after having enjoyed to the full their luxurious pleasures, they
   "in a moment go down to the grave," (Job 21:13.) And it is related of
   Julius Caesar, that, the day before he was put to death, he remarked,
   that to die suddenly and unexpectedly, seemed to him to be a happy
   death. Thus, then, according to the opinion of these expositors, David
   complains that the wicked go to death by a smooth and easy path,
   without much trouble and anxiety. But I am rather inclined to agree
   with those who read these two clauses jointly in this way: Their
   strength is vigorous, and, in respect to them, there are no bands to
   death; because they are not dragged to death like prisoners. [162] As
   diseases lay prostrate our strength, they are so many messengers of
   death, warning us of the frailty and short duration of our life. They
   are therefore with propriety compared to bands, with which God binds us
   to his yoke, lest our strength and rigour should incite us to
   licentiousness and rebellion.

   5. They are not in the trouble that is common to man. Here it is
   declared that the wicked enjoy a delightful repose, and are as it were
   by special privilege exempted from the miseries to which mankind in
   general are subject. They also are no doubt involved in afflictions as
   well as the good, and God often executes his judgments upon them; but,
   for the express purpose of trying our faith, he always places some of
   them as it were upon an elevated stage, who appear to be privileged to
   live in a state of exemption from calamities, as is here described.
   Now, when we consider that the life of men is full of labor and
   miseries, and that this is the law and condition of living appointed
   for all, it is a sore temptation to behold the despisers of God
   indulging themselves in their luxurious pleasures and enjoying great
   ease, as if they were elevated above the rest of the world into a
   region of pleasure, where they had a nest for themselves apart. [163]

   6. Therefore pride compasseth them as a chain. This complaint proceeds
   farther than the preceding; for we are here told that although God sees
   the ungodly shamefully and wickedly abusing his kindness and clemency,
   he notwithstanding bears with their ingratitude and rebellion. The
   Psalmist employs a similitude taken from the dress and attire of the
   body, to show that such persons glory in their evil deeds. The verb nq,
   anak, which we have rendered, encompasseth them as a chain, comes from
   a noun which signifies a chain. The language, therefore, implies that
   the ungodly glory in their audacity and madness, as if they were richly
   adorned with a chain of gold: [164] and that violence serves them for
   raiment, thinking, as they do, that it renders them very stately and
   honorable. Some translate the Hebrew word syt, shith, which we have
   rendered raiment, by buttocks; but this is a sense which the scope of
   the passage will by no means admit. David, I have no doubt, after
   having commenced at the neck or head -- for the Hebrew verb nq, anak
   which he uses, signifies also sometimes to crown [165] -- now meant to
   comprehend, in one word, the whole attire of the person. The amount of
   what is stated is, that the wicked are so blinded with their
   prosperity, as to become more and more proud and insolent [166] The
   Psalmist has very properly put pride first in order, and then added
   violence to it as its companion; for what is the reason why the ungodly
   seize and plunder whatever they can get on all sides, and exercise so
   much cruelty, but because they account all other men as nothing in
   comparison of themselves; or rather persuade themselves that mankind
   are born only for them? The source, then, and, as it were, the mother
   of all violence, is pride.

   7. Their eye goeth out for fatness. [167] He now adds, that it is not
   wonderful to see the ungodly breaking forth with such violence and
   cruelty, since, by reason of fatness and pampering, their eyes are
   ready to start out of their heads. Some explain the words goeth out as
   meaning, that their eyes being covered and hidden with fat, were, so to
   speak, lost, and could not be perceived in their sockets. But as fat
   causes the eyes to project from the head, I prefer retaining the proper
   meaning of the words. Let it, however, be observed, that David is not
   to be understood as speaking of the bodily countenance, but as
   expressing metaphorically the pride with which the ungodly are inflated
   on account of the abundance which they possess. They so glut and
   intoxicate themselves with their prosperity, that afterwards they are
   ready to burst with pride. The last clause of the verse is also
   explained in two ways. Some think that by the verb vr, abar, which we
   have translated passed beyond, is denoted unbridled presumption; [168]
   for the ungodly are not contented to keep themselves within ordinary
   bounds, but in their wild and extravagant projects mount above the
   clouds. We know, in fact, that they often deliberate with themselves
   how they may take possession of the whole world; yea, they would wish
   God to create new worlds for them. In short, being altogether
   insatiable, they pass beyond heaven and earth in their wild and
   unbounded desires. It would certainly not be inappropriate to explain
   the verb as meaning, that their foolish thoughts can be regulated by no
   law, nor kept within any bounds. But there is another exposition which
   is also very suitable, namely, that the prosperity and success which
   they meet with exceed all the flattering prospects which they had
   pictured in their imaginations. We certainly see some of them who
   obtain more than ever they had desired, as if, whilst they were asleep,
   Fortune laid nets and fished for them, [169] -- the device under which
   king Demetrius was in old time wittily painted, who had taken so many
   cities, although otherwise he was neither skillful nor vigilant, nor of
   great foresight. If we are inclined to take this view of the words,
   this clause will be added by way of exposition, to teach us what is
   meant by that fatness, spoken of before -- that it means that God heaps
   upon the wicked, and fills them with, an abundance of all good things,
   beyond what they had ever either desired or thought of.

   8. They become insolent, and wickedly talk of extortion. Some take the
   verb ymyqv, yamicu, in an active transitive sense, and explain it as
   meaning, that the wicked soften, that is to say, render others
   pusillanimous, or frighten and intimidate them. [170] But as the idiom
   of the language admits also of its being understood in the neuter
   sense, I have adopted the interpretation which agreed best with the
   scope of the passage, namely, that the wicked, forgetting themselves to
   be men, and by their unbounded audacity trampling under foot all shame
   and honesty, dissemble not their wickedness, but, on the contrary,
   loudly boast of their extortion. And, indeed, we see that wicked men,
   after having for some time got every thing to prosper according to
   their desires, cast off all sham and are at no pains to conceal
   themselves when about to commit iniquity, but loudly proclaim their own
   turpitude. "What!" they will say, "is it not in my power to deprive you
   of all that you possess, and even to cut your throat?" Robbers, it is
   true, can do the same thing; but then they hide themselves for fear.
   These giants, or rather inhuman monsters, of whom David speaks, on the
   contrary not only imagine that they are exempted from subjection to any
   law, but, unmindful of their own weakness, foam furiously, as if there
   were no distinction between good and evil, between right and wrong. If,
   however, the other interpretation should be preferred, That the wicked
   intimidate the simple and peaceable by boasting of the great
   oppressions and outrages which they can perpetrate upon them, I do not
   object to it. When the poor and the afflicted find themselves at the
   mercy of these wicked men, they cannot but tremble, and, so to speak,
   melt and dissolve upon seeing them in possession of so much power. With
   respect to the expression, They speak from on high, [171] implies, that
   they pour forth their insolent and abusive speech upon the heads of all
   others. As proud men, who disdain to look directly at any body, are
   said, in the Latin tongue, despicere, and in the Greek, Katablepein,
   that is, to look down; [172] so David introduces them as speaking from
   on high, because it seems to them that they have nothing in common with
   other men, but think themselves a distinct class of beings, and, as it
   were, little gods. [173]

   9. They have set their mouth against the heavens. Here it is declared
   that they utter their contumelious speeches as well against God as
   against men; for they imagine that nothing is too arduous for them to
   attempt, and flatter themselves that heaven and earth are subject to
   them. If any should endeavor to alarm them by setting before them the
   power of God, they audaciously break through this barrier; and, with
   respect to men, they have no idea of any difficulty arising from such a
   quarter. Thus, there is no obstacle to repress their proud and vaunting
   speeches, but their tongue walketh through the whole earth. This form
   of expression seems to be hyperbolical; but when we consider how great
   and unbounded their presumption is, we will admit that the Psalmist
   teaches nothing but what experience shows to be matter of fact.

   [162] "They are not dragged to death," says Poole, "either by the hand
   or sentence of the magistrate, which yet they deserve, nor by any
   lingering or grievous torments of mind or body, which is the case with
   many good men; but they enjoy a sweet and quiet death, dropping into
   the grave like ripe fruit from the tree, without any violence used to
   them, (compare Job 5:26 and 31:13.) The word translated bands occurs in
   only one other place of Scripture, Isaiah 58:6, where in all the
   ancient versions it is rendered bands But bands will bear various
   significations. In the Hebrew style it often signifies the pangs of
   child-birth; and therefore the meaning here may be, they have no pangs
   in their death; i e., they die an easy death, being suffered to live on
   to extreme old age, when the flame of life gradually and quietly
   becomes extinct. It was also used by the Hebrews to express diseases of
   any kind, and this is the sense, in which Calvin understands it. Thus
   Jesus says of the "woman who had a spirit of infirmity," a sore disease
   inflicted upon her by an evil spirit, "eighteen years," "Thou art
   loosed from thine infirmity," (and loosing, we know, applies to bands:)
   he again describes her as "this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath
   bound, lo, these eighteen years;" and farther says, "Ought she not to
   be loosed from this bond?" that is, cured of this sickness? Luke 13:11,
   12, 16. According to this view, the meaning will be, they have no
   violent diseases in their death Horsley reads, "There is no fatality in
   their death." After observing that the word chrtsvvt, translated bands,
   occurs but in one other place in the whole Bible, Isaiah 58:6; where
   the LXX. have rendered it sundesmon, and the Vulgate colligationes, he
   says, "From its sense there, and from its seeming affinity with the
   roots chrph and tsvh, I should guess that in a secondary and figurative
   sense, the word may denote the strongest of all bands or knots,
   physical necessity, or fate; and in that sense it may be taken here.
   The complaint is, that the ordinary constitution of the world is
   supposed to contain no certain provision for the extermination of the
   impious; that there is no necessary and immediate connection between
   moral evil and physical, wickedness and death." The Septuagint reads,
   hoti ouk estin ananeusis en to Thanato auton: "For there is no sign of
   reluctance in their death." The Vulgate, "Quia non est respectus morti
   eorum;" "For they do not think of dying," or, "For they take no notice
   of their death." The Chaldee, "They are not terrified or troubled on
   account of the day of their death."

   [164] There is here a metaphorical allusion to the rich collars or
   chains worn about the necks of great personages for ornament. Compare
   Proverbs 1:9, and Cant. 4, 9. Pride compassed these prosperous wicked
   men about as a chain; they wore it for an ornament as gold chains or
   collars were worn about the neck; discovering it by their stately
   carriage. See Isaiah 3:16. Or there may be an allusion to the office
   which some of them bore; for chains of gold were among the ensigns of
   magistracy and civil power.

   [165] Accordingly, the Chaldee, instead of "compasseth them as a
   chain." has "crowneth them as a crown or diadem does the head."

   [166] "Violence covereth them as a garment. Wicked men that are
   prosperous and proud, are generally oppressive to others; and are very
   often open in their acts of violence, which are as openly done, and to
   be seen of all men, as the clothes they wear upon their backs; and
   frequently the clothes they wear are got by rapine and oppression, so
   that they may properly be called garments of violence. See Isaiah
   59:6." -- Dr Gill.

   oppression and violence; they make their hearts to melt with their
   threatening and terrifying words; or they make them dissolute in their
   lives by keeping them company." Mudge reads, "They behave corruptly;"
   and Horsley, "They are in the last stage of degeneracy."

   [171] The original word, mmrvm, memmarom, for from on high, is

   Psalm 73:10-14

   10. On this account his people will return hither, and waters of a full
   cup will be wrung out to them. 11. And they say, How doth God know? and
   is there knowledge in the Most High? 12. Behold! These are the ungodly,
   and yet they enjoy repose [or quietness] for ever: they heap up riches.
   13. Surely I have purified my heart in vain, and washed my hands daily.
   [174] 14. And I have been scourged daily, and my chastisement has been
   every morning.


   10. On this account his people will return hither. Commentators wrest
   this sentence into a variety of meanings. In the first place, as the
   relative his is used, without an antecedent indicating whose people are
   spoken of, some understand it simply of the ungodly, as if it had been
   said, That the ungodly always fall back upon this reflection: and they
   view the word people as denoting a great troop or band; for as soon as
   a wicked man raises his standard, he always succeeds in drawing a
   multitude of associates after him. They, therefore, think the meaning
   to be, that every prosperous ungodly man has people flocking about him,
   as it were, in troops; and that, when within his palace or magnificent
   mansion, they are content with getting water to drink; so much does
   this perverse imagination bewitch them. But there is another sense much
   more correct, and which is also approved by the majority of
   commentators; namely, that the people of God [175] return hither. Some
   take the word hlm, halom, which we have rendered hither, as denoting
   afflicted; [176] but this is a forced interpretation.

   The meaning is not, however, as yet, sufficiently evident, and
   therefore we must inquire into it more closely. [177] Some read the
   whole verse connectedly, thus: The people of God return hither, that
   they may drain full cups of the water of sorrow. But, in my opinion,
   this verse depends upon the preceding statements, and the sense is,
   That many who had been regarded as belonging to the people of God were
   carried away by this temptation, and were even shipwrecked and
   swallowed up by it. The prophet does not seem to speak here of the
   chosen people of God, but only to point to hypocrites and counterfeit
   Israelites who occupy a place in the Church. He declares that such
   persons are overwhelmed in destruction, because, being foolishly led
   away to envy the wicked, and to desire to follow them, [178] they bid
   adieu to God and to all religion. Still, however, this might, without
   any impropriety, be referred to the chosen seed, many of whom are so
   violently harassed by this temptation, that they turn aside into
   crooked by-paths: not that they devote themselves to wickedness, but
   because they do not firmly persevere in the right path. The sense then
   will be, that not only the herd of the profane, but even true
   believers, who have determined to serve God, are tempted with this
   unlawful and perverse envy and emulation. [179] What follows, Waters of
   a full cup are wrung out to them, [180] seems to be the reason of the
   statement in the preceding clause, implying that they are tormented
   with vexation and sorrow, when no advantage appears to be derived from
   cultivating true religion. To be saturated with waters is put
   metaphorically for to drink the bitterest distresses, and to be filled
   with immeasurable sorrows.

   11. And they say, How doth God know? Some commentators maintain that
   the Prophet here returns to the ungodly, and relates the scoffings and
   blasphemies with which they stimulate and stir up themselves to commit
   sin; but of this I cannot approve. David rather explains what he had
   stated in the preceding verse, as to the fact that the faithful fall
   into evil thoughts and wicked imaginations when the short-lived
   prosperity of the ungodly dazzles their eyes. He tells us that they
   begin then to call in question, Whether there is knowledge in God.
   Among worldly men, this madness is too common. Ovid thus speaks in one
   of his verses:

   "Sollicitor nullos esse putare deos;"
   "I am tempted to think that there are no gods."

   It was, indeed, a heathen poet who spake in this manner; but as we know
   that the poets express the common thoughts of men, and the language
   which generally predominates in their minds, [181] it is certain that
   he spake, as it were, in the person of the great mass of mankind, when
   he frankly confessed, that as soon as any adversity happens, men forget
   all knowledge of God. They not only doubt whether there is a God, but
   they even enter into debate with, and chide him. What else is the
   meaning of that complaint which we meet with in the ancient Latin Poet-

   "Nec Saturnius haec oculis pater adspicit aequis:"

   "Nor does the great god, the son of Saturn, regard these things with
   impartial eyes," -- but that the woman, of whom he there speaks,
   accuses her god Jupiter of unrighteousness, because she was not dealt
   with in the way which she desired? It is then too common, among the
   unbelieving part of mankind, to deny that God cares for and governs the
   world, and to maintain that all is the result of chance. [182] But
   David here informs us that even true believers stumble in this respect:
   not that they break forth into this blasphemy, but because they are
   unable, all at once, to keep their minds under restraint when God seems
   to cease from executing his office. The expostulation of Jeremiah is
   well known,

   "Righteous art thou, O Lord! when I plead with thee; yet let me talk
   with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked
   prosper? Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?"
   (Jeremiah 12:1)

   It appears from that passage that even the godly are tempted to doubt
   of the Providence of God, but at the same time that doubts on this
   subject do not go very deep into their hearts; for Jeremiah at the
   outset protests the contrary; and by doing so, puts, as it were, a
   bridle upon himself. Yet they do not always so speedily anticipate the
   snares of Satan, as to avoid asking, under the influence of a doubting
   spirit, how it can happen, if God really regards the world, that he
   does not remedy the great confusion which prevails in it? Of those who
   impiously prate against God by denying his Providence, there are two
   sorts. Some openly pour out their blasphemies, asserting that God,
   delighting in ease and pleasure, cares about nothing, but leaves the
   government of all things to chance. Others, although they keep their
   thoughts on this subject to themselves, and are silent before men, yet
   cease not secretly to fret against God, and to accuse him of injustice
   or of indolence, in conniving at wickedness, neglecting the godly, and
   allowing all things to be involved in confusion, and to go to wreck.
   But the people of God, before these perverse and detestable thoughts
   enter deep into their hearts, disburden themselves into the bosom of
   God, [183] and their only desire is to acquiesce in his secret
   judgments, the reason of which is hidden from them. The meaning of this
   passage, therefore, is, that not only the wicked, when they see things
   in the world so full of disorder, conceive only of a blind government,
   which they attribute to fortune or chance; but that even true believers
   themselves are shaken, so as to doubt of the Providence of God; and
   that unless they were wonderfully preserved by his hand, they would be
   completely swallowed up in this abyss.

   12. Behold! these are the ungodly. The Psalmist here shows, as it were
   by a vivid pictorial representation, the character of that envy which
   had well nigh overthrown him. Behold! says he, these are wicked men!
   and yet they happily enjoy their ease and pleasures undisturbed, and
   are exalted to power and influence; and that not merely for a few days,
   but their prosperity is of long duration, and has, as it were, an
   endless course. And is there anything which seems to our judgment less
   reasonable than that persons whose wickedness is accounted infamous and
   detestable, even in the eyes of men, should be treated with such
   liberality and indulgence by God? Some here take the Hebrew word vlm,
   olam, for the world, but improperly. It rather denotes in this passage
   an age; [184] and what David complains of is, that the prosperity of
   the wicked is stable and of long duration, and that to see it last so
   long wears out the patience of the righteous. Upon seeing the wicked so
   tenderly cherished by God, he descends to the consideration of his own
   case; and as his conscience bore him testimony that he had walked
   sincerely and uprightly, he reasons with himself as to what advantage
   he had derived from studiously devoting himself to the practice of
   righteousness, since he was afflicted and harassed in a very unusual
   degree. He tells us that he was scourged daily, and that as often as
   the sun rose, some affliction or other was prepared for him, so that
   there was no end to his calamities. In short the amount of his
   reasoning is this, "Truly I have labored in vain to obtain and preserve
   a pure heart and clean hands, seeing continued afflictions await me,
   and, so to speak, are on the watch to meet me at break of day. Such a
   condition surely shows that there is no reward for innocence before
   God, else he would certainly deal somewhat more compassionately towards
   those who serve him." As the true holiness for which the godly are
   distinguished consists of two parts, first, of purity of heart, and,
   secondly, of righteousness in the outward conduct, David attributes
   both to himself. Let us learn, from his example, to join them together:
   let us, in the first place, begin with purity of heart, and then let us
   give evidence of this before men by uprightness and integrity in our
   conduct.

   innocency." The Psalmist may allude to the rite of ablution which was
   in use among the Jews. See Deuteronomy 21:6, and Psalm 26:6. Or he may
   be understood as signifying by the metaphor of washing the hands in
   general, the pains which he took to be blameless in the whole of his
   outward conduct. "Opposite to the phrase, to wash in innocence," says
   Merrick, "is the scelere imbuere of Cicero, (Philipp. v.) Cum autem

   read hlvm, which I take as the participle Pual of the verb hlm,
   Contusus miseria,' scilicet." He reads, "Therefore his [God's] people
   sit woebegone." To make out this translation, he adopts another of the
   various readings of MSS. "For ysyv," says he, "many MSS. have ysvv: I
   would transpose the vau, and read yvsv. The third person future,
   Hophal, signifies is made to sit, is settled, attended with grief and

   [179] While Calvin admits that the words, his people, may refer to true
   believers, he conceives that carnal and hypocritical Israelites are
   rather intended. One great objection to the opinion, that true
   believers are at all intended is, that stumbled though they often are
   at the unequal distributions of the present state, and chargeable
   though they may be with entertaining murmuring thoughts in reference to
   this matter, we can scarcely suppose that they would so far depart from
   every principle of truth and propriety, as to break forth into such
   language as is ascribed in verse 11th to the persons here spoken of,
   "How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?" Neither
   David nor Jeremiah, though much perplexed in reconciling the prosperity
   of the wicked and the afflicted state of God's people, with the
   righteousness and goodness of Divine Providence, ever gave utterance to
   any such language. See Psalm 38 and Jeremiah 12. Walford thinks that
   "it is far more agreeable to the design of the entire passage, to
   interpret the words, his people, of the friends and connections of the
   wicked, who imitate their actions." In support of this it may be
   observed, that the description of the condition, conduct, and words, of
   these prosperous ungodly men, commences at the 4th verse, and seems to
   be continued to the 13th verse, where the Psalmist's reflections upon
   the subject begin, and are continued to the close of the psalm.

   [180] This has also been understood as denoting the prosperity, the
   abundance of all outward good things bestowed upon the persons referred

   Psalm 73:15-17

   15. If I should say, I will speak thus, Behold! the generation of thy
   children: I have transgressed. [185] 16. Although I applied my mind to
   know this, it was a trouble [or, a painful thing] in my sight; 17.
   Until I entered into the sanctuaries of God, and understood [186] their
   latter end.


   15. If I should say, I will speak thus. David, perceiving the
   sinfulness of the thoughts with which he was tempted, puts a bridle
   upon himself, and reproves his inconstancy in allowing his mind to
   entertain doubts on such a subject. We can be at no loss in discovering
   his meaning; but there is some difficulty or obscurity in the words.
   The last Hebrew verb in the verse, vgd, bagad, signifies to transgress,
   and also to deceive. Some, therefore, translate, I have deceived the
   generation of thy children, as if David had said, Were I to speak thus,
   I should defraud thy children of their hope. Others read, I have
   transgressed against the generation of thy children; that is, Were I to
   speak thus, I would be guilty of inflicting an injury upon them. But as
   the words of the prophet stand in this order, Behold! the generation of
   thy children: I have transgressed; and as a very good meaning may be
   elicited from them, I would expound them simply in this way: Were I to
   approve of such wicked thoughts and doubts, I would transgress; for,
   behold! the righteous are still remaining on the earth, and thou
   reservest in every age some people for thyself. Thus it will be
   unnecessary to make any supplement to complete the sense, and the verb
   vgdty, bagadti, I have transgressed, will read by itself, and not
   construed with any other part of the verse. We have elsewhere had
   occasion to observe, that the Hebrew noun dvr, dor, which we have
   rendered generation, is properly to be referred to time. The idea which
   David intends to convey is now perfectly obvious. Whilst worldly men
   give loose reins to their unhallowed speculations, until at length they
   become hardened, and, divesting themselves of all fear of God, cast
   away along with it the hope of salvation, he restrains himself that he
   may not rush into the like destruction. To speak or to declare [187]
   here signifies to utter what had been meditated upon. His meaning,
   therefore, is, that had he pronounced judgment on this subject as of a
   thing certain, he would have been chargeable with a very heinous
   transgression. He found himself before involved in doubt, but now he
   acknowledges that he had grievously offended; and the reason of this he
   places between the words in which he expresses these two states of
   mind: which is, because God always sees to it, that there are some of
   his own people remaining in the world. He seems to repeat the
   demonstrative particle, Behold! for the sake of contrast. He had a
   little before said, Behold! these are the ungodly; and here he says,
   Behold! the generation of thy children. It is assuredly nothing less
   than a divine miracle that the Church, which is so furiously assaulted
   by Satan and innumerable hosts of enemies, continues safe.

   16. Although I applied my mind to know this. The first verb chsv,
   chashab, which he employs, properly signifies to reckon or count, and
   sometimes to consider or weigh. But the words which follow in the
   sentence require the sense which I have given, That he applied his mind
   to know the part of Divine Providence referred to. He has already
   condemned himself for having transgressed; but still he acknowledges,
   that until he entered into the sanctuaries of God, he was not
   altogether disentangled from the doubts with which his mind had been
   perplexed. In short, he intimates that he had reflected on this subject
   on all sides, and yet, by all his reasoning upon it, could not
   comprehend how God, amidst so great disorders and confusions, continued
   to govern the world. Moreover, in speaking thus of himself, he teaches
   us, that when men are merely under the guidance of their own
   understandings, the inevitable consequence is, that they sink under
   their trouble, not being able by their own deliberations and reasonings
   to arrive at any certain or fixed conclusions; for there is no doubt
   that he puts the sanctuaries of God in opposition to carnal reason.
   Hence it follows, that all the knowledge and wisdom which men have of
   their own is vain and unsubstantial; since all true wisdom among men --
   all that deserves to be so called -- consists in this one point, [188]
   That they are docile, and implicitly submit to the teaching of the Word
   of God. The Psalmist does not speak of unbelievers who are wilfully
   blind, who involve themselves in errors, and are also very glad to find
   some color or pretext for taking offense, that they may withdraw to a
   distance from God. It is of himself that he speaks; and although he
   applied his mind to the investigation of divine subjects, not only
   earnestly, but with all humility; and although, at the same time, he
   contemplated, according to his small measure, the high judgments of
   God, not only with attention, but also with reverence, yet he confesses
   that he failed of success; for the word trouble [189] here implies
   unprofitable or lost labor. Whoever, therefore, in applying himself to
   the examination of God's judgments, expects to become acquainted with
   them by his natural understanding, will be disappointed, and will find
   that he is engaged in a task at once painful and profitless; and,
   therefore, it is indispensably necessary to rise higher, and to seek
   illumination from heaven.

   By the sanctuaries of God some, even among the Hebrews, understand the
   celestial mansions in which the spirits of the just and angels dwell;
   as if David had said, This was a painful thing in my sight, until I
   came to acknowledge in good earnest that men are not created to
   flourish for a short time in this world, and to luxuriate in pleasures
   while in it, but that their condition here is that of pilgrims, whose
   aspirations, during their earthly pilgrimage, should be towards heaven.
   I readily admit that no man can form a right judgment of the providence
   of God; but he who elevates his mind above the earth; but it is more
   simple and natural to understand the word sanctuary as denoting
   celestial doctrine. As the book of the law was laid up in the
   sanctuary, from which the oracles of heaven were to be obtained, that
   is to say, the declaration of the will of God, [190] and as this was
   the true way of acquiring profitable instruction, David very properly
   puts entering into the sanctuaries, [191] for coming to the school of
   God, as if his meaning were this, Until God become my schoolmaster, and
   until I learn by his word what otherwise my mind, when I come to
   consider the government of the world, cannot comprehend, I stop short
   all at once, and understand nothing about the subject. When, therefore,
   we are here told that men are unfit for contemplating the arrangements
   of Divine Providence until they obtain wisdom elsewhere than from
   themselves, how can we attain to wisdom but by submissively receiving
   what God teaches us both by his Word and by his Holy Spirit? David by
   the word sanctuary alludes to the external manner of teaching, which
   God had appointed among his ancient people; but along with the Word he
   comprehends the secret illumination of the Holy Spirit.

   By the end of the wicked is not meant their exit from the world, or
   their departure from the present life, which is seen of all men -- for
   what need was there to enter into the sanctuaries of God to understand
   that? -- but the word end is to be regarded as referring to the
   judgments of God, by which he makes it manifest that, even when he is
   commonly thought to be asleep, he only delays to a convenient time the
   execution of the punishment which the wicked deserve. This must be
   explained at greater length. If we would learn from God what is the
   condition of the ungodly, he teaches us, that after having flourished
   for some short time, they suddenly decay; and that although they may
   happen to enjoy a continued course of prosperity until death, yet all
   that is nothing, since their life itself is nothing. As, then, God
   declares that all the wicked shall miserably perish, if we behold him
   executing manifest vengeance upon them in this life, let us remember
   that it is the judgment of God. If, on the contrary, we do not perceive
   any punishment inflicted on them in this world, let us beware of
   thinking that they have escaped, or that they are the objects of the
   Divine favor and approbation; [192] but let us rather suspend our
   judgment, since the end or the last day has not yet arrived. In short,
   if we would profit aright, when we address ourselves to the
   consideration of the works of God, we must first beseech him to open
   our eyes, (for these are sheer fools who would of themselves be
   clear-sighted, and of a penetrating judgment;) and, secondly, we must
   also give all due respect to his word, by assigning to it that
   authority to which it is entitled.

   Psalm 73:18-20

   18. Surely thou hast set them in slippery places; thou shalt cast them
   down into destruction. 19. How have they been destroyed, as it were in
   a moment! they have perished, they have been consumed with terrors. 20.
   As it were a dream after a man is awakened: O Lord! in awaking, [193]
   thou wilt make their image to be despised, [or contemptible.]


   18. Surely thou hast set them in slippery places. David, having now
   gone through his conflicts, begins, if we may use the expression, to be
   a new man; and he speaks with a quiet and composed mind, being, as it
   were, elevated on a watchtower, from which he obtained a clear and
   distinct view of things which before were hidden from him. It was the
   prophet Habakkuk's resolution to take such a position, and, by his
   example, he prescribes this to us as a remedy in the midst of troubles
   -- "I will stand upon my watch," says he, "and set me upon the tower,"
   (Habakkuk 2:1.) David, therefore, shows how much advantage is to be
   derived from approaching God. I now see, says he, how thou proceedest
   in thy providence; for, although the ungodly continue to stand for a
   brief season, yet they are, as it were, perched on slippery places,
   [194] that they may fall ere long into destruction. Both the verbs of
   this verse are in the past tense; but the first, to set them in
   slippery places, is to be understood of the present time, as if it had
   been said, -- God for a short period thus lifts them up on high, that
   when they fall their fall may be the heavier. This, it is true, seems
   to be the lot of the righteous as well as of the wicked; for everything
   in this world is slippery, uncertain, and changeable. But as true
   believers depend upon heaven, or rather, as the power of God is the
   foundation on which they rest, it is not said of them that they are set
   in slippery places, notwithstanding the frailty and uncertainty which
   characterises their condition in this world. What although they stumble
   or even fall, the Lord has his hand under them to sustain and
   strengthen them when they stumble, and to raise them up when they are
   fallen. The uncertainty of the condition of the ungodly, or, as it is
   here expressed, their slippery condition, proceeds from this, that they
   take pleasure in contemplating their own power and greatness, and
   admire themselves on that account, just like a person who would walk at
   leisure upon ice; [195] and thus by their infatuated presumption, they
   prepare themselves for falling down headlong. We are not to picture to
   our imaginations a wheel of fortune, which, as it revolves, embroils
   all things in confusion; but we must admit the truth to which the
   prophet here adverts, and which he tells us is made known to all the
   godly in the sanctuary, that there is a secret providence of God which
   manages all the affairs of the world. On this subject my readers, if
   they choose, may peruse the beautiful verses of Claudian in his first
   book against Ruffinus.

   19. How have they been destroyed, as it were in a moment! The language
   of wonder in which the Psalmist breaks forth serves much to confirm the
   sentiment of the preceding verse. As the consideration of the
   prosperity of the ungodly induces a torpor upon our minds, yea, even
   renders them stupid; so their destruction, being sudden and unlooked
   for, tends the more effectually to awaken us, each being thus
   constrained to inquire how such an event came to pass, which all men
   thought could never happen. The prophet, therefore, speaks of it in the
   way of interrogation, as of a thing incredible. Yet he, at the same
   time, thus teaches us that God is daily working in such a manner as
   that, if we would but open our eyes, there would be presented to us
   just matter for exciting our astonishment. Nay, rather, if by faith we
   would look from a distance at the judgments of God daily approaching
   nearer and nearer, nothing would happen which we would regard as
   strange or difficult to be believed; for the surprise which we feel
   proceeds from the slowness and carelessness with which we proceed in
   acquiring the knowledge of Divine truth. [196] When it is said, They
   are consumed with terrors, it may be understood in two ways. It either
   means that God thunders upon them in such an unusual manner, that the
   very strangeness of it strikes them with dismay; or that God, although
   he may not lay his hand upon his enemies, nevertheless throws them into
   consternation, and brings them to nothing, solely by the terror of his
   breath, at the very time when they are recklessly despising all
   dangers, as if they were perfectly safe, and had made a covenant with
   death. [197] Thus we have before seen David introducing them as
   encouraging themselves in their forwardness by this boasting language,
   "Who is lord over us?" (Psalm 12:4.) I am rather inclined to adopt the
   first sense; and the reason which leads me to do so is, that when God
   perceives that we are so slow in considering his judgments, he inflicts
   upon the ungodly judgments of a very severe kind, and pursues them with
   unusual tokens of his wrath, as if he would make the earth to tremble,
   in order thereby to correct our dullness of apprehension.

   20. As it were a dream after a man is awakened. This similitude is
   often to be met with in the Sacred Writings. Thus, Isaiah, (Isaiah
   29:7,) speaking of the enemies of the Church, says, "They shall be as a
   dream of a night vision." To quote other texts of a similar kind would
   be tedious and unnecessary labor. In the passage before us the metaphor
   is very appropriate. How is it to be accounted for, that the prosperity
   of the wicked is regarded with so much wonder, but because our minds
   have been lulled into a deep sleep? and, in short, the pictures which
   we draw in our imaginations of the happiness of the wicked, and of the
   desirableness of their condition, are just like the imaginary kingdoms
   which we construct in our dreams when we are asleep. Those who, being
   illuminated by the Word of God, are awake, may indeed be in some degree
   impressed with the splendor with which the wicked are invested; but
   they are not so dazzled by it as thereby to have their wonder very much
   excited; for they are prevented from feeling in this manner by a light
   of an opposite kind far surpassing it in brilliancy and attraction. The
   prophet, therefore, commands us to awake, that we may perceive that all
   which we gaze at in this world is nothing else than pure vanity; even
   as he himself, now returning to his right mind, acknowledges that he
   had before been only dreaming and raving. The reason is added, because
   God will make their image to be despised, or render it contemptible. By
   the word image some understand the soul of man, because it was formed
   after the image of God. But in my opinion, this exposition is
   unsuitable; for the prophet simply derides the outward pomp or show
   [198] which dazzles the eyes of men, while yet it vanishes away in an
   instant. We have met with a similar form of expression in Psalm 39:6,
   "Surely every man passeth away in an image," the import of which is,
   Surely every man flows away like water that has no solidity, or rather
   like the image reflected in the mirror which has no substance. The word
   image, then, in this passage means what we commonly term appearance, or
   outward show; and thus the prophet indirectly rebukes the error into
   which we fall, when we regard as real and substantial those things
   which are merely phantoms created out of nothing by our imaginations.
   The word vyr, bair, properly signifies in the city. [199] But as this
   would be a rigid form of expression, it has been judiciously thought by
   many that the word is curtailed of a letter, and that it is the same as
   vhyr, bahair; an opinion which is also supported from the point kamets
   being placed under v, beth. According to this view it is to be
   translated in awakening, that is, after these dreams which deceive us
   shall have passed away. And that takes place not only when God restores
   to some measure of order matters which before were involved in
   confusion, but also when dispelling the darkness he gladdens our minds
   with a friendly light. We never, it is true, see things so well
   adjusted in the world as we would desire; for God, with the view of
   keeping us always in the exercise of hope, delays the perfection of our
   state to the final day of judgment. But whenever he stretches forth his
   hand against the wicked, he causes us to see as it were some rays of
   the break of day, that the darkness, thickening too much, may not lull
   us asleep, and affect us with dullness of understanding. [200] Some
   apply this expression, in awaking, to the last judgment, [201] as if
   David intended to say, In this world the wicked abound in riches and
   power, and this confusion, which is as it were a dark night, will
   continue until God shall raise the dead. I certainly admit that this is
   a profitable doctrine; but it is not taught us in this place, the scope
   of the passage not at all agreeing with such an interpretation. If any
   prefer reading in the city -- in the city thou wilt make their image to
   be despised, -- the meaning will be, that when God is pleased to bring
   into contempt the transitory beauty and vain show of the wicked, it
   will not be a secret or hidden vengeance, but will be quite manifest
   and known to all, as if it were done in the public market place of a
   city. But the word awaking suits better, as it is put in opposition to
   dreaming.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [193] Martin thinks that there is here an allusion to the time at which
   judicial sentences were pronounced, which was in the morning, when men
   awoke from the sleep of night.

   [194] "Comme junchez en lieux glissans." -- Fr.

   [195] "Qu'ils prenent plaisir a contempler leur puissance et grandeur,
   et sy mirent, comme qui voudroit se pourmener a loisir sur la glace."
   -- Fr.

   [196] "De nostre tardivete et nonchalance a profiter en la doctrine."
   -- Fr.

   [197] "They are utterly consumed with terrors; their destruction is not
   only sudden, but entire; it is like the breaking in pieces of a
   potter's vessel, a sherd of which cannot be gathered up and used; or
   like the casting of a millstone into the sea, which will never rise
   more: and this is done with terrors, -- either by terrible judgments
   inflicted on them from without, or with terrors inwardly seizing upon
   their minds and consciences, as at the time of temporal calamities, or
   at death, and certainly at the judgment, when the awful sentence will
   be pronounced upon them. See Job 27:20." -- Dr. Gill.

   [198] With this agree Bishop Horsley and Dr Adam Clarke. The former
   translates: -- "Like the dream of a man beginning to wake publicly,
   O Lord! thou renderest their vain show contemptible." The latter: --
   "Like to a dream after one awaketh,
   So wilt thou, O Jehovah! when thou risest up,
   Destroy their shadowy grandeur." The original word, tslm tselem, for
   image, means likeness, corporeal or incorporeal; and it agrees with
   tsl, tsel, a shade, because an image is, as if the shade or shadow of
   the body. See Bythner on Psalm 39:6. "It seems to be taken here," says
   Hammond, "for that which hath a fantastical only in opposition to a
   real substantial being." "The Hebrew term," says Walford, "means an
   unsubstantial appearance, splendid while it continues, but which in an
   instant disappears." The prosperity which wicked men for a time enjoy,
   their greatness, riches, honor, and happiness, however dazzling and
   imposing, is thus nothing more than an image or shadow of prosperity,
   an empty phantom; and within a short period it ceases to be even so
   much as a shadow, it absolutely vanishes and comes to nothing,
   convincing the good but afflicted man, to whom it seemed to involve in
   doubt the rectitude of the Divine government, what is its real
   character, and that it should never occasion any perplexity to the
   student of Divine Providence.

   [199] The LXX. read, en te polei sou, "in thy city," deriving the
   original word from yr ir, a city Such, also, is the reading of the
   Vulgate, Arabic, and Æthiopic versions. But the word comes from vr, ur,
   to awahe, and is in the infinitive hiph v, beth, excluding h, he,
   characteristic of the conjugation.

   [200] "As a dream of one who awaketh. The thought here is, as a
   pleasing dream vanishes instantly on awaking, so the pleasures of these
   men will vanish, and show their unsubstantial nature, when God shall
   effect his righteous judgement." -- Walford. Then the prosperity of the
   wicked is seen to be fantastic, and to consist only of "such stuff as
   dreams are made of."

   [201] "The Chaldee in their paraphrase refer it to the day of judgment,
   when wicked men shall rise out of their graves, and God proceed in
   wrath against them, (tvsr vrgz dmvthvn, in fury shalt thou scorn or
   despise them,') according to that expression of Daniel 12:2, Many of
   them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to shame and
   everlasting contempt.'" -- Hammond

   Psalm 73:21-24

   21. For my heart was in a ferment, and I was pierced in my reins. 22.
   And I was foolish and ignorant: I was with thee as a brute beast. 23.
   Nevertheless I was continually with thee; thou didst hold my right
   hand. 24. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel; and at length thou
   shalt take me to [or receive me into] glory.


   21. For my heart was in a ferment. The Psalmist again returns to the
   confession which he had previously made, acknowledging that whilst he
   felt his heart pierced with perverse envy and emulation, he had
   complained against God, in a peevish or fretful manner. He compares his
   anger to leaven. Some translate, My heart was steeped in vinegar. But
   it is more suitable to explain the verb thus, My heart was soured or
   swollen, as dough is swollen by leaven. Thus Plautus, when speaking of
   a woman inflamed with anger, says that she is all in a ferment. [202]
   Some read the last clause of the verse, My reins were pierced; and they
   think that ', aleph, in the beginning of the word, 'stvnn, eshtonan,
   the verb for pierced, is put instead of h, he; [203] but this makes
   little difference as to the sense. We know that the word klyvt,
   kelayoth, by which the Hebrews denote the reins, comes from the verb
   kl', kalah, which signifies to desire, to covet earnestly, this word
   being put for the reins, because it is said that the desires of man
   have their seat in that part of the body. David therefore declares that
   these perplexing and troublesome thoughts had been, as it were, thorns
   which pierced him. [204] We have already stated how he came to be
   affected with this pungent and burning vexation of spirit. We will find
   many worldly men who, although they deny that the world is governed by
   the Providence of God, yet do not greatly disquiet themselves, but only
   laugh at the freaks of Fortune. On the other hand, true believers, the
   more firmly they are persuaded that God is the judge of the world, are
   the more afflicted when his procedure does not correspond to their
   wishes.

   22. And I was foolish and ignorant. David here rebuking himself
   sharply, as it became him to do, in the first place declares that he
   was foolish; secondly, he charges himself with ignorance; and, thirdly,
   he affirms that he resembled the brutes. Had he only acknowledged his
   ignorance, it might have been asked, Whence this vice or fault of
   ignorance proceeded? He therefore ascribes it to his own folly; and the
   more emphatically to express his folly, he compares himself to the
   lower animals. The amount is, that the perverse envy of which he has
   spoken arose from ignorance and error, and that the blame of having
   thus erred was to be imputed wholly to himself, inasmuch as he had lost
   a sound judgment and understanding, and that not after an ordinary
   manner, but even the length of being reduced to a state of brutish
   stupidity. What we have previously stated is undoubtedly true, that men
   never form a right judgment of the works of God; for when they apply
   their minds to consider them, all their faculties fail, being
   inadequate to the task; yet David justly lays the blame of failure upon
   himself, because, having lost the judgment of a man, he had fallen as
   it were into the rank of the brute creatures. Whenever we are
   dissatisfied with the manner of God's providence in governing the
   world, let us remember that this is to be traced to the perversity of
   our understanding. The Hebrew word mk, immach, which we have translated
   with thee, is here to be taken by way of comparison for before thee; as
   if David had said, -- Lord, although I have seemed in this world to be
   endued with superior judgment and reason, yet in respect of thy
   celestial wisdom, I have been as one of the lower animals. It is with
   the highest propriety that he has inserted this particle. To what is it
   owing, that men are so deceived by their own folly, as we find them to
   be, if it is not to this, that while they look at each other, they all
   inwardly flatter themselves? Among the blind, each thinks that he has
   one eye, in other words, that he excels the rest; or, at least, he
   pleases himself with the reflection, that his fellows are in no respect
   superior to himself in wisdom. But when persons come to God, and
   compare themselves with him, this prevailing error, in which all are
   fast asleep, can find no place.

   23 Nevertheless I was continually with thee. [205] Here the Psalmist
   declares, in a different sense, that he was with God. He gives him
   thanks for having kept him from utterly falling, when he was in so
   great danger of being precipitated into destruction. The greatness of
   the favor to which he adverts is the more strikingly manifested from
   the confession which he made a little before, that he was bereft of
   judgment, and, as it were, a brute beast; for he richly deserved to be
   cast off by God, when he dared to murmur against him. Men are said to
   be with God in two ways; either, first, in respect of apprehension and
   thought, when they are persuaded that they live in his presence, are
   governed by his hand, and sustained by his power; or, secondly, when
   God, unperceived by them, puts upon them a bridle, by which, when they
   go astray, he secretly restrains them, and prevents them from totally
   apostatising from him. When a man therefore imagines that God exercises
   no care about him, he is not with God, as to his own feeling or
   apprehension; but still that man, if he is not forsaken, abides with
   God, inasmuch as God's secret or hidden grace continues with him. In
   short, God is always near his chosen ones; for although they sometimes
   turn their backs upon him, he nevertheless has always his fatherly eye
   turned towards them. When the Psalmist speaks of God as holding him by
   the right hand, he means that he was, by the wonderful power of God,
   drawn back from that deep gulf into which the reprobate cast
   themselves. He then ascribes it wholly to the grace of God that he was
   enabled to restrain himself from breaking forth into open blasphemies,
   and from hardening himself in error, and that he was also brought to
   condemn himself of foolishness; -- this he ascribes wholly to the grace
   of God, who stretched out his hand to hold him up, and prevent him from
   a fall which would have involved him in destruction. From this we see
   how precious our salvation is in the sight of God; for when we wander
   far from him, he yet continues to look upon us with a watchful eye, and
   to stretch forth his hand to bring us to himself. We must indeed beware
   of perverting this doctrine by making it a pretext for slothfulness;
   but experience nevertheless teaches us, that when we are sunk in
   drowsiness and insensibility, God exercises a care about us, and that
   even when we are fugitives and wanderers from him, he is still near us.
   The force of the metaphor contained in the language, which represents
   God as holding us by the right hand, is to be particularly noticed; for
   there is no temptation, let it be never so slight, which would not
   easily overthrow us, were we not upheld and sustained by the power of
   God. The reason then why we do not succumb, even in the severest
   conflicts, is nothing else than because we receive the aid of the Holy
   Spirit. He does not indeed always put forth his power in us in an
   evident and striking manner, (for he often perfects it in our
   weakness;) but it is enough that he succours us, although we may be
   ignorant and unconscious of it, that he upholds us when we stumble, and
   even lifts us up when we have fallen.

   24. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel. As the verbs are put in the
   future tense, the natural meaning, in my opinion, is, that the Psalmist
   assured himself that the Lord, since by his leading he had now brought
   him back into the right way, would continue henceforth to guide him,
   until at length he received him into His glorious presence in heaven.
   We know that it is David's usual way, when he gives thanks to God, to
   look forward with confidence to the future. Accordingly, after having
   acknowledged his own infirmities, he celebrated the grace of God, the
   aid and comfort of which he had experienced; and now he cherishes the
   hope that the Divine assistance will continue hereafter to be extended
   to him. Guidance by counsel is put first. Although the foolish and
   inconsiderate are sometimes very successful in their affairs, (for God
   remedies our faults and errors, and turns to a prosperous and happy
   issue things which we had entered upon amiss;) yet the way in which God
   ordinarily and more abundantly blesses his own people is by giving them
   wisdom: and we should ask him especially to govern us by the Spirit of
   counsel and of judgment. Whoever dares, in a spirit of confident
   reliance on his own wisdom, to engage in any undertaking, will
   inevitably be involved in confusion and shame for his presumption,
   since he arrogates to himself what is peculiar to God alone. If David
   needed to have God for his guide, how much more need have we of being
   under the Divine guidance? To counsel there is added glory, which, I
   think, ought not to be limited to eternal life, as some are inclined to
   do. It comprehends the whole course of our happiness from the
   commencement, which is seen here upon earth, even to the consummation
   which we expect to realize in heaven. David then assures himself of
   eternal glory, through the free and unmerited favor of God, and yet he
   does not exclude the blessings which God bestows upon his people here
   below, with the view of affording them, even in this life, some
   foretaste of that felicity.

   Psalm 73:25-28

   25. Who is there to me in heaven? [206] And I have desired none other
   with thee [207] upon the earth. 26. My flesh and my heart have failed:
   but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. 27. For,
   lo: they who depart from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all
   those who go a whoring from thee. [208] 28. As for me, it is good for
   me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, that I
   may recount all thy works. [209]


   25. Whom have I in heaven but thee? The Psalmist shows more distinctly
   how much he had profited in the sanctuary of God; for being satisfied
   with him alone, he rejects every other object, except God, which
   presented itself to him. The form of expression which he employs, when
   he joins together an interrogation and an affirmation, is quite common
   in the Hebrew tongue, although harsh in other languages. As to the
   meaning, there is no ambiguity. David declares that he desires nothing,
   either in heaven or in earth, except God alone, and that without God,
   all other objects which usually draw the hearts of men towards them
   were unattractive to him. And, undoubtedly, God then obtains from us
   the glory to which he is entitled, when, instead of being carried first
   to one object, and then to another, we hold exclusively by him, being
   satisfied with him alone. If we give the smallest portion of our
   affections to the creatures, we in so far defraud God of the honor
   which belongs to him. And yet nothing has been more common in all ages
   than this sacrilege, and it prevails too much at the present day. How
   small is the number of those who keep their affections fixed on God
   alone! We see how superstition joins to him many others as rivals for
   our affections. While the Papists admit in word that all things depend
   upon God, they are, nevertheless, constantly seeking to obtain help
   from this and the other quarter independent of him. Others, puffed up
   with pride, have the effrontery to associate either themselves or other
   men with God. On this account we ought the more carefully to attend to
   this doctrine, That it is unlawful for us to desire any other object
   besides God. By the words heaven and earth the Psalmist denotes every
   conceivable object; but, at the same time, he seems purposely to point
   to these two in particular. In saying that he sought none in heaven but
   God only, he rejects and renounces all the false gods with which,
   through the common error and folly of mankind, heaven has been filled.
   When he affirms that he desires none on the earth besides God, he has,
   I suppose, a reference to the deceits and illusions with which almost
   the whole world is intoxicated; for those who are not beguiled by the
   former artifice of Satan, so as to be led to fabricate for themselves
   false gods, either deceive themselves by arrogance when confiding in
   their own skill, or strength, or prudence, they usurp the prerogatives
   which belong to God alone; or else trepan themselves with deceitful
   allurements when they rely upon the favor of men, or confide in their
   own riches and other helps which they possess. If, then, we would seek
   God aright, we must beware of going astray into various by-paths, and
   divested of all superstition and pride, must betake ourselves directly
   and exclusively to Him. This is the only way of seeking him. The
   expression, I have desired none other with thee, amounts to this: I
   know that thou by thyself, apart from every other object, art
   sufficient, yea, more than sufficient for me, and therefore I do not
   suffer myself to be carried away after a variety of desires, but rest
   in and am fully contented with thee. In short, that we may be satisfied
   with God alone, it is of importance for us to know the plenitude of the
   blessings which he offers for our acceptance.

   26. My flesh and my heart have failed. Some understand the first part
   of the verse as meaning that David's heart and flesh failed him through
   the ardent desire with which he was actuated; and they think that by it
   he intends to testify the earnestness with which he applied his mind to
   God. We meet with a similar form of expression elsewhere; but the
   clause immediately succeeding, God is the strength of my heart, seems
   to require that it should be explained differently. I am rather
   disposed to think that there is here a contrast between the failing
   which David felt in himself and the strength with which he was divinely
   supplied; as if he had said, Separated from God I am nothing, and all
   that I attempt to do ends in nothing; but when I come to him, I find an
   abundant supply of strength. It is highly necessary for us to consider
   what we are without God; for no man will cast himself wholly upon God,
   but he who feels himself in a fainting condition, and who despairs of
   the sufficiency of his own powers. We will seek nothing from God but
   what we are conscious of wanting in ourselves. Indeed, all men confess
   this, and the greater part think that all which is necessary is that
   God should aid our infirmities, or afford us succor when we have not
   the means of adequately relieving ourselves. But the confession of
   David is far more ample than this when he lays, so to speak, his own
   nothingness before God. He, therefore, very properly adds, that God is
   his portion. The portion of an individual is a figurative expression,
   employed in Scripture to denote the condition or lot with which every
   man is contented. Accordingly, the reason why God is represented as a
   portion is, because he alone is abundantly sufficient for us, and
   because in him the perfection of our happiness consists. Whence it
   follows, that we are chargeable with ingratitude, if we turn away our
   minds from him and fix them on any other object, as has been stated in
   Psalm 16:4, where David explains more clearly the import of the
   metaphor. Some foolishly assert that God is called our portion, because
   our soul is taken from him. I know not how such a silly conceit has
   found its way into their brains; for it is as far from David's meaning
   as heaven is from the earth, and it involves in it the wild notion of
   the Manicheans, with which Servetus was bewitched. But it generally
   happens that men who are not exercised in the Scriptures, nor imbued
   with sound theology, although well acquainted with the Hebrew language,
   yet err and fall into mistakes even in first principles. Under the word
   heart the Psalmist comprehends the whole soul. He does not, however,
   mean, when he speaks of the heart failing, that the essence or
   substance of the soul fails, but that all the powers which God in his
   goodness has bestowed upon it, and the use of which it retains only so
   long as he pleases, fall into decay.

   27. For, lo! they who depart from thee shall perish. Here he proves, by
   an argument taken from things contrary, that nothing was better for him
   than simply to repose himself upon God alone; for no sooner does any
   one depart from God than he inevitably falls into the most dreadful
   destruction. All depart from him who divide and scatter their hope
   among a variety of objects. The phrase to go a whoring [210] is of
   similar import; for it is the worst kind of adultery to divide our
   heart that it may not continue fixed exclusively upon God. This will be
   more easily understood by defining the spiritual chastity of our minds,
   which consists in faith, in calling upon God, in integrity of heart,
   and in obedience to the Word. Whoever then submits not himself to the
   Word of God, that feeling him to be the sole author of all good things,
   he may depend upon him, surrender himself to be governed by him, betake
   himself to him at all times, and devote to him all his affections, such
   a person is like an adulterous woman who leaves her own husband, and
   prostitutes herself to strangers. David's language then is equivalent
   to his pronouncing all apostates who revolt from God to be adulterers.

   28. As for me, it is good for me to draw near to God. Literally the
   reading is, And I, etc. David speaking expressly of himself, affirms
   that although he should see all mankind in a state of estrangement from
   God, and wandering after the ever-changing errors and superstitions of
   the world, he would nevertheless study to continue always in a state of
   nearness to God. Let others perish, says he, if their headstrong
   passions cannot be restrained, and they themselves prevented from
   running after the deceits of the world; but as for me, I will continue
   steadfast in the resolution of maintaining a sacred communion with God.
   In the subsequent clause he informs us that we draw near to God in a
   right manner when our confidence continues firmly fixed in him. God
   will not hold us by his right hand unless we are fully persuaded of the
   impossibility of our continuing steadfast and safe in any other way
   than by his grace alone. This passage is worthy of notice, that we may
   not be carried away by evil examples, to join ourselves to the wicked,
   and to act as they do, although even the whole world should fall into
   unbelief; but that we may learn to gather in our affections from other
   objects, and to confine them exclusively to God. In the close, the
   Psalmist intimates that after he shall have devoted himself to God
   alone, he shall never want matter for praising him, since God never
   disappoints the hope which his people repose in him. From this it
   follows, that none curse God or murmur against him, but those who
   wilfully shut their eyes and involve themselves in darkness, lest
   knowing and observing his providence, they should be induced to give
   themselves up to his faithfulness and protection.

   of high treason against Jehovah the King of Israel.

   PSALM 74

   The people of God in this psalm bewail the desolate condition of the
   Church, which was such that the very name of Israel was almost
   annihilated. It appears from their humble supplications that they
   impute to their own sins all the calamities which they endured; but at
   the same time they lay before God his own covenant by which he adopted
   the race of Abraham as his peculiar people. Afterwards they call to
   remembrance how mightily and gloriously he had in the days of old
   displayed his power in delivering his Church. Encouraging themselves
   from this consideration, they beseech Him that he would at length come
   to their aid, and remedy a state of matters so deplorable and
   desperate.

   An instruction of Asaph.

   The inscription mskyl, maskil, agrees very well with the subject of the
   psalm; for although it is sometimes applied to subjects of a joyful
   description, as we have seen in the forty-fifth psalm, yet it generally
   indicates that the subject treated of is the divine judgments, by which
   men are compelled to descend into themselves, and to examine their own
   sins, that they may humble themselves before God. It is easy to gather
   from the contents of the psalm, that its composition cannot be ascribed
   to David; for in his time there was no ground for mourning over such a
   wasted and calamitous condition of the Church as is here depicted.
   Those who are of a different opinion allege, that David by the spirit
   of prophecy foretold what had not yet come to pass. But as it is
   probable that there are many of the psalms which were composed by
   different authors after the death of David, this psalm, I have no
   doubt, is one of their number. What calamity is here spoken of, it is
   not easy precisely to determine. On this point there are two opinions.
   Some suppose that the reference is to that period of Jewish history
   when the city and the temple were destroyed, and when the people were
   carried away captives to Babylon under king Nebuchadnezzar; [211] and
   others, that it relates to the period when the temple was profaned,
   under Antiochus Epiphanes. There is some plausibility in both these
   opinions. From the fact that the faithful here complain of being now
   without signs and prophets, the latter opinion would seem the more
   probable; for it is well known that many prophets flourished when the
   people were carried into captivity. On the other hand, when it is said
   a little before that the sanctuaries were burnt to ashes, the carved
   works destroyed, and that nothing remained entire, these statements do
   not apply to the cruelty and tyranny of Antiochus. He indeed shamefully
   polluted the temple, by introducing into it heathen superstitions; but
   the building itself continued uninjured, and the timber and stones were
   not at that time consumed with fire. Some maintain that by sanctuaries
   we are to understand the synagogues in which the Jews were accustomed
   to hold their holy assemblies, not only at Jerusalem, but also in the
   other cities of Judea. It is also a supposable case, that the faithful
   beholding the awful desecration of the temple by Antiochus, were led
   from so melancholy a spectacle to carry their thoughts back to the time
   when it was burnt by the Chaldeans, and that they comprehend the two
   calamities in one description. Thus the conjecture will be more
   probable that these complaints belong to the time of Antiochus; [212]
   for the Church of God was then without prophets. If, however, any would
   rather refer it to the Babylonish captivity, it will be an easy matter
   to solve this difficulty; for although Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel,
   were then alive, yet we know that they were silent for a time, as if
   they had finished the course of their vocation, until at length Daniel,
   a little before the day of their deliverance, again came forth for the
   purpose of inspiring the poor exiles with courage to return to their
   own country. To this the prophet Isaiah seems to have an eye, when he
   says in the fortieth chapter (Isaiah 40:1) of his prophecies at the
   beginning, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, will your God say." The
   verb, which is there in the future tense, shows that the prophets were
   enjoined to hold their peace for a time.

   Psalm 74:1-8

   1. O God! why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thy anger smoke
   against the flock of thy pastures? 2. Remember thy congregation, which
   thou hast possessed of old, the rod of thy inheritance which thou hast
   redeemed, this mount Zion on which thou hast dwelt. 3. Lift up thy
   strokes to destroy for ever every enemy that worketh mischief to thy
   sanctuary. 4. Thy adversaries have roared [213] in the midst of thy
   sanctuaries; they have set up their signs for signs. 5. He who lifted
   up the axes upon the thick trees was renowned as doing an excellent
   work. 6. And now they break in pieces the carved work thereof with axes
   and hammers together. 7. They have set on fire thy sanctuaries; they
   have polluted the dwelling-place of thy name, levelling it with the
   ground. 8. They have said in their heart, Let us destroy them all
   together: they have burned all the tabernacles of God in the land.


   1. O God! why hast thou east us off for ever? If this complaint was
   written when the people were captives in Babylon, although Jeremiah had
   assigned the 70th year of their captivity as the period of their
   deliverance, it is not wonderful that waiting so long was to them a
   very bitter affliction, that they daily groaned under it, and that so
   protracted a period seemed to them like an eternity. As to those who
   were persecuted by the cruelty of Antiochus, they might, not without
   reason, complain of the wrath of God being perpetual, from their want
   of information as to any definite time when this persecution would
   terminate; and especially when they saw the cruelty of their enemies
   daily increasing without any hope of relief, and that their condition
   was constantly proceeding from bad to worse. Having been before this
   greatly reduced by the many disastrous wars, which their neighbors one
   after another had waged against them, they were now brought almost to
   the brink of utter destruction. It is to be observed, that the
   faithful, when persecuted by the heathen nations, lifted up their eyes
   to God, as if all the evils which they suffered had been inflicted by
   his hand alone. They were convinced, that had not God been angry with
   them, the heathen nations would not have been permitted to take such
   license in injuring them. Being persuaded, then, that they were not
   encountering merely the opposition of flesh and blood, but that they
   were afflicted by the just judgment of God, they direct their thoughts
   to the true cause of all their calamities, which was, that God, under
   whose favor they had formerly lived prosperous and happy, had cast them
   off, and deigned no longer to account them as his flock. The verb znh,
   zanach, signifies to reject and detest, and sometimes also to withdraw
   one's self to a distance. It is of no great moment in which of these
   senses it is here taken. We may consider the amount of what is stated
   as simply this, that whenever we are visited with adversities, these
   are not the arrows of fortune thrown against us at a venture, but the
   scourges or rods of God which, in his secret and mysterious providence,
   he prepares and makes use of for chastising our sins. Casting off and
   anger must here be referred to the apprehension or judgment of the
   flesh. Properly speaking, God is not angry with his elect, whose
   diseases he cures by afflictions as it were by medicines; but as the
   chastisements which we experience powerfully tend to produce in our
   minds apprehensions of his wrath, the Holy Spirit, by the word anger,
   admonishes the faithful to acknowledge their guilt in the presence of
   infinite purity. When, therefore, God executes his vengeance upon us,
   it is our duty seriously to reflect on what we have deserved, and to
   consider, that although He is not subject to the emotions of anger, yet
   it is not owing to us, who have grievously offended him by our sins,
   that his anger is not kindled against us. Moreover, his people, as a
   plea for obtaining mercy, flee to the remembrance of the covenant by
   which they were adopted to be his children. In calling themselves the
   flock of God's pastures, they magnify his free choice of them by which
   they were separated from the Gentiles. This they express more plainly
   in the following verse.

   2. Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed of old. [214]
   Here they boast of having been the peculiar people of God, not on
   account of any merit of their own, but by the grace of adoption. They
   boast in like manner of their antiquity, -- that they are not subjects
   who have come under the government of God only within a few months ago,
   but such as had fallen to him by right of inheritance. The longer the
   period during which he had continued his love towards the seed of
   Abraham, the more fully was their faith confirmed. They declare,
   therefore, that they had been God's people from the beginning, that is,
   ever since he had entered into an inviolable covenant with Abraham.
   There is also added the redemption by which the adoption was ratified;
   for God did not only signify by word, but also showed by deed at the
   time when this redemption was effected, that he was their King and
   Protector. These benefits which they had received from God they set
   before themselves as an encouragement to their trusting in him, and
   they recount them before him, the benefactor who bestowed them, as an
   argument with him not to forsake the work of his own hands. Inspired
   with confidence by the same benefits, they call themselves the rod of
   his inheritance; that is to say, the heritage which he had measured out
   for himself. The allusion is to the custom which then prevailed of
   measuring or marking out the boundaries of grounds with poles as with
   cords or lines. Some would rather translate the word svt, shebet, which
   we have rendered rod, by tribe; but I prefer the other translation,
   taking the meaning to be, that God separated Israel from the other
   nations to be his own proper ground, by the secret pre-ordination which
   originated in his own good pleasure, as by a measuring rod. In the last
   place, the temple in which God had promised to dwell is mentioned; not
   that his essence was enclosed in that place, -- an observation which
   has already been frequently made, -- but because his people experienced
   that there he was near at hand, and present with them by his power and
   grace. We now clearly perceive whence the people derived confidence in
   prayer; it was from God's free election and promises, and from the
   sacred worship which had been set up among them.

   3. Lift up thy strokes. Here the people of God, on the other hand,
   beseech him to inflict a deadly wound upon their enemies, corresponding
   to the cruelty with which they had raged against his sanctuary. They
   would intimate, that a moderate degree of punishment was not sufficient
   for such impious and sacrilegious fury; and that, therefore, those who
   had shown themselves such violent enemies of the temple and of the
   worshippers of God should be completely destroyed, their impiety being
   altogether desperate. As the Holy Spirit has dictated this form of
   prayer, we may infer from it, in the first place, the infinite love
   which God bears towards us, when he is pleased to punish so severely
   the wrongs inflicted upon us; and, in the second place, the high
   estimation in which he holds the worship yielded to his Divine majesty,
   when he pursues with such rigour those who have violated it. With
   respect to the words, some translate phmym, pheamim, which we have
   rendered strokes, by feet or steps, [215] and understand the Church as
   praying that the Lord would lift up his feet, and run swiftly to strike
   her enemies. Others translate it hammers, [216] which suits very well.
   I have, however, no hesitation in following the opinion of those who
   consider the reference to be to the act of striking, and that the
   strokes themselves are denoted. The last clause of the verse is
   explained by some as meaning that the enemy had corrupted all things in
   the sanctuary. [217] But as this construction is not to be found
   elsewhere, I would not depart from the received and approved reading.

   4. Thy adversaries have roared in the midst of thy sanctuaries. Here
   the people of God compare their enemies to lions, (Amos 3:8,) to point
   out the cruelty which they exercised even in the very sanctuaries of
   God. [218] In this passage we are to understand the temple of Jerusalem
   as spoken of rather than the Jewish synagogues; nor is it any objection
   to this interpretation that the temple is here called in the plural
   number sanctuaries, as is frequently the case in other places, it being
   so called because it was divided into three parts. If any, however,
   think it preferable to consider synagogues as intended, I would not
   dispute the point. Yea, without any impropriety, it may be extended to
   the whole land, which God had consecrated to himself. But the language
   is much more emphatic when we consider the temple as meant. It thus
   intimates, that the rage of the enemy was so unbounded and
   indiscriminate that they did not even spare the temple of God. When it
   is said, They have set up their signs, [219] this serves to show their
   insulting and contemptuous conduct, that in erecting their standards
   they proudly triumphed even over God himself. Some explain this of
   magical divinations, [220] even as Ezekiel testifies, (Ezekiel 21:21,
   22,) that Nebuchadnezzar sought counsel from the flight and the voice
   of birds; but this sense is too restricted. The explanation which I
   have given may be viewed as very suitable. Whoever entered into the
   Holy Land knew that the worship of God which flourished there was of a
   special character, and different from that which was performed in any
   other part of the world: [221] the temple was a token of the presence
   of God, and by it he seemed, as if with banners displayed, to hold that
   people under his authority and dominion. With these symbols, which
   distinguished the chosen tribes from the heathen nations, the prophet
   here contrasts the sacrilegious standards which their enemies had
   brought into the temple. [222] By repeating the word signs twice, he
   means to aggravate the abominable nature of their act; for having
   thrown down the tokens and ensigns of the true service of God, they set
   up in their stead strange symbols.

   5. He who lifted up the axe upon the thick trees was renowned. The
   prophet again aggravates still more the barbarous and brutal cruelty of
   the enemies of his countrymen, from the circumstance, that they
   savagely demolished an edifice which had been built at such vast
   expense, which was embellished with such beauty and magnificence, and
   finished with so great labor and art. There is some obscurity in the
   words; but the sense in which they are almost universally understood
   is, that when the temple was about to be built, those who cut and
   prepared the wood required for it were in great reputation and renown.
   Some take the verb mvy', mebi, in an active sense, and explain the
   words as meaning that the persons spoken of were illustrious and well
   known, as if they had offered sacrifices to God. The thickness of the
   trees is set in opposition to the polished beams, to show the more
   clearly with what exquisite art the rough and unwrought timber was
   brought into a form of the greatest beauty and magnificence. Or the
   prophet means, what I am inclined to think is the more correct
   interpretation, that in the thick forests, where there was vast
   abundance of wood, great care was taken in the selection of the trees,
   that none might be cut down but such as were of the very best quality.
   May it not perhaps be understood in this sense, That in these thick
   forests the trees to which the axe was to be applied were well known
   and marked, as being already of great height, and exposed to the view
   of beholders? Whatever may be as to this, the prophet, there is no
   doubt, in this verse commends the excellence of the material which was
   selected with such care, and was so exquisite, that it attracted the
   gaze and excited the admiration of all who saw it; even as in the
   following verse, by the carved or graven work is meant the beauty of
   the building, which was finished with unequalled art, But now it is
   declared, that the Chaldeans, with utter recklessness, made havoc with
   their axes upon this splendid edifice, as if it had been their object
   to tread under foot the glory of God by destroying so magnificent a
   structure. [223]

   7. They have set fire to thy sanctuaries. The Psalmist now complains
   that the temple was burned, and thus completely razed and destroyed,
   whereas it was only half demolished by the instruments of war. Many
   have supposed that the order of the words has been here inverted, [224]
   not being able to perceive how a suitable meaning could be elicited
   from them, and therefore would resolve them thus, They have put fire
   into thy sanctuaries. I have, however, no doubt that the sense which I
   have given, although the accent is against it, is the true and natural
   one, That the temple was levelled with the ground by being burned. This
   verse corroborates more fully the statement which I have made, that the
   temple is called sanctuaries in the plural number, because it consisted
   of three parts, -- the innermost sanctuary, the middle sanctuary, and
   the outer court; for there immediately follows the expression, The
   dwelling-place of thy name. The name of God is here employed to teach
   us that his essence was not confined to or shut up in the temple, but
   that he dwelt in it by his power and operation, that the people might
   there call upon him with the greater confidence.

   8. They have said in their heart, Let us destroy them all together. To
   express the more forcibly the atrocious cruelty of the enemies of the
   Church, the prophet introduces them speaking together, and exciting one
   another to commit devastation without limit or measure. His language
   implies, that each of them, as if they had not possessed enough of
   courage to do mischief, stirred up and stimulated his fellow to waste
   and destroy the whole of God's people, without leaving so much as one
   of them. In the close of the verse he asserts that all the synagogues
   were burned. I readily take the Hebrew word mvdym, moadim, in the sense
   of synagogues, [225] because he says ALL the sanctuaries, and speaks
   expressly of the whole land. It is a frigid explanation which is given
   by some, that these enemies, upon finding that they could not hurt or
   do violence to the sanctuary of God in heaven, turned their rage
   against the material temple or synagogues. The prophet simply complains
   that they were so intent upon blotting out the name of God, that they
   left not a single corner on which there was not the mark of the hand of
   violence. The Hebrew word mvdym, moadim, is commonly taken for the
   sanctuary; but when we consider its etymology, it is not
   inappropriately applied to those places where the holy assemblies were
   wont to be held, not only for reading and expounding the prophets, but
   also for calling upon the name of God. The wicked, as if the prophet
   had said, have done all in their power to extinguish and annihilate the
   worship of God in Judea.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [213] "Ont rugi comme lions." -- Fr. "Have roared like lions."

   [214] Archbishop Secker thinks that this verse may be read thus:
   "Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased, hast redeemed of
   old; the tribe of thine inheritance; this mount Zion," etc.

   [215] "That phmym means feet or steps is evident from Psalms 17:5 57:6;
   and 58:10 Lift up thy feet, advance not slowly or by stealth, but with
   large and stately steps, full in the view of all; come to thy
   sanctuary, so long suffered to lie waste; examine what has been done
   there, and let thy grace and aid, hitherto so much withheld, be
   extended to us." -- Gejer To lift up the feet is a Hebraism for "to put
   one's self in motion;" "to set out on a journey," as may be learned
   from Genesis 29:1, where of Jacob it is said, "He lifted up his feet,
   and went into the east country." Lifting up the feet is used for going,
   in the same way as opening the mouth is for speaking.

   [216] "There is another notion of phm, for a mallet or hammer, Isaiah
   41:7 and Kimchi would have that to be the meaning here,hvrm phm, lift
   up thy mallet,' in opposition to the axes and hammers,' verse 6; and
   thus also Abu Walid, lift up thy dashing instruments.' And the LXX.,
   who read, eparon tas cheiras, lift up thy hands,' come near this." --
   Hammond

   [217] This is the sense put upon the words by some Jewish interpreters.
   Thus Abu Walid reads, "Lift up thy dashing instruments, because of the
   utter destructions which the enemy hath made, and because of all the
   evil that he hath done in or on the sanctuary." Aben Ezra has, "because
   of the perpetual desolations," that is, because of thy inheritance
   which is laid waste. Piscator takes the same view: "Betake thyself to
   Jerusalem, that thou mayest see these perpetual desolations which the
   Babylonians have wrought." In like manner, Gejer, who observes that
   this sense is preferable to that which considers the words as a prayer,
   that God would lift up his feet for the perpetual ruin of the enemy,
   because the Psalmist has been hitherto occupied with a mere description
   of misery, and has used nothing of the language of imprecation. But the
   Chaldee has, "Lift up thy goings or footsteps, to make desolate the
   nations for ever;" that is, Come and spread desolation among those
   enemies who have invaded and so cruelly reduced thy sanctuary to ruins.

   [218] Instead of songs of praise and other acts of devotion, nothing
   was now heard in the Jewish places of worship but profane vociferation,
   and the tumultuous noise of a heathen army. This is with great beauty
   and effect compared to the roaring of a lion.

   [219] Hammond reads, "They set up their ensigns for trophies." The
   original word both for ensigns and trophies is 'vt, oth But he observes
   that it requires here to be differently translated. 'vt, oth, signifies
   a sign, and thence a military standard or ensign The setting up of this
   in any place which has been taken by arms, is a token or sign of the
   victory achieved; and, accordingly, an ensign or standard thus set up
   becomes a trophy To convey, therefore, the distinctive meaning, he
   contends that it is necessary in this passage to give different
   renderings to the same word.

   [220] That is, they understand signs to mean such signs as diviners or
   soothsayers were wont to give, by which to foretell things to come.
   Jarchi, who adopts this interpretation, gives this sense: That the
   enemies of God's people having completed their conquest according to
   the auspices or signs of soothsayers, were fully convinced that these
   signs were real signs; in other words, that the art of divination was
   true.

   [221] "Qu'il y avoit un service divine special et different de ce qui
   se faisoit ailleurs." -- Fr.

   [222] "Their own symbols they have set for signs. Profane
   representations, no doubt, agreeable to their own worship. See 1
   Maccabees 1:47." -- Dr Geddes.

   [223] In the English Common Prayer-Book the 5th and 6th verses are
   translated thus: -- "He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees
   was known to bring it to an excellent work. But now they break down all
   the carved work thereof with axes and hammers." Dr Nicholls' paraphrase
   of this is as follows: "It is well known from the sacred records of our
   nation to what admirable beauty the skillful hand of the artificers
   brought the rough cedar trees, which were cut down by the hatchets of
   Hiram's woodmen in the thick Tyrian forests. But now they tear down all
   the curious carvings, that cost so much time and exquisite labor, with
   axes and hammers, and other rude instruments of iron." "This is a clear
   and consistent sense of the passages" says Mant, "and affords a
   striking and well imagined contrast."

   [224] The order of the words is this, slchv v's mqdsk shilchu baesh
   mikdashecha, literally, "They have sent into fire thy sanctuary."

   [225] It has been objected, that if this psalm was composed at the time
   of the captivity of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar, and the desolation of
   the Holy Land by the Chaldeans, mvdy, moadey, cannot signify
   synagogues, because the Jews had no synagogues for public worship or
   public instruction till after the Babylonish captivity. Accordingly, Dr
   Prideaux thinks that the Proseuchae are meant. These were courts
   resembling those in which the people prayed at the tabernacle, and
   afterwards at the temple, built by those who lived at a distance from
   Jerusalem, and who were unable at all times to resort thither. They
   were erected as places in which the Jews might offer up their daily
   prayers. "They differed," says Prideaux, "from synagogues in several
   particulars. For, first, In synagogues the prayers were offered up in
   public forms in common for the whole congregation; but in the
   Proseuchae they prayed as in the temple, every one apart for himself.
   Secondly, The synagogues were covered houses; but the Proseuchae were
   open courts, built in the manner of forums, which were open enclosures.
   Thirdly, Synagogues were all built within the cities to which they did
   belong; but the Proseuchae without." -- Connection of the History,
   etc., Part 1, Book 6, pages 139-141. Synagogues were afterwards used
   for the same purpose as the Proseuchae, and hence both come to be
   designated by the same name. The same author supposes that those places
   in the cities of the Levites, and the schools of the prophets, whither
   the people resorted for instruction, having been called, as well as the
   Proseuchae, mvdy-'l, moadey-el, are also here intended. "The word mvdy,
   moadey," says Dr Adam Clarke, "which we translate synagogues, may be
   taken in a more general sense, and mean any places where religious
   assemblies were held; and that such places and assemblies did exist
   long before the Babylonish captivity is pretty evident from different
   parts of Scripture." See 2 Kings 4:23; Ezekiel 33:31; Acts 15:21. All
   such places were consumed to ashes by the hostile invaders whose
   ravages are bewailed, it having been their purpose to extinguish for
   ever the Jewish religion, and, as the most likely means of effecting
   their object, to destroy every memorial of it.

   Psalm 74:9-12

   9. We see not our signs: there is no longer a prophet, nor any with us
   that knoweth how long. 10. How long, O God! shall the adversary
   reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 11. How long
   wilt thou withdraw thy hand, and thy right hand? in the midst of thy
   bosom consume them. [226] 12. But God is my King from the beginning,
   working deliverances in the midst of the earth.


   9. We see not our signs. Here the pious Jews show that their calamities
   were aggravated from the circumstance that they had no consolation by
   which to alleviate them. It is a powerful means of encouraging the
   children of God, when he enables them to cherish the hope of his being
   reconciled to them, by promising, that even in the midst of his wrath
   he will remember his mercy. Some limit the signs here spoken of to the
   miracles by which God had in the days of old testified, at the very
   time when he was afflicting his people, that he would, notwithstanding,
   still continue to be gracious to them. But the faithful rather complain
   that he had removed from them the tokens of his favor, and had in a
   manner hidden his face from them. [227] We are overwhelmed with
   darkness, as if the prophet had said, because thou, O God! dost not
   make thy face to shine upon us as thou hast been accustomed to do. Thus
   it is common for us to speak of persons giving us signs either of their
   love or of their hatred. In short, God's people here complain not only
   that the time was cloudy and dark, but also that they were enveloped in
   darkness so thick, that there did not appear so much as a single ray of
   light. As to be assured by the prophets of future deliverance was one
   of the chief signs of God's favor, they lament that there is no longer
   a prophet to foresee the end of their calamities. From this we learn
   that the office of imparting consolation was committed to the prophets,
   that they might lift up the hearts which were cast down with sorrow, by
   inspiring them with the hope of Divine mercy. They were, it is true,
   heralds and witnesses of the wrath of God to drive the obstinate and
   rebellious to repentance by threatenings and terrors. But had they
   merely and without qualification denounced the vengeance of God, their
   doctrine, which was appointed and intended for the salvation of the
   people, would have only been the means of their destruction.
   Accordingly, the foretelling of the issue of calamities while yet
   hidden in the future, is ascribed to them as a part of their office;
   for temporary punishments are the fatherly chastisements of God, and
   the consideration that they are temporary alleviates sorrow; but his
   continual displeasure causes poor and wretched sinners to sink into
   utter despair. If, therefore, we also would find matter for patience
   and consolation, when we are under the chastening hand of God, let us
   learn to fix our eyes on this moderation on the part of God, by which
   he encourages us to entertain good hope; and from it let us rest
   assured, that although he is angry, yet he ceases not to be a father.
   The correction which brings deliverance does not inflict unmitigated
   grief: the sadness which it produces is mingled with joy. This end all
   the prophets endeavored to keep in view in the doctrine which they
   delivered. They, no doubt, often make use of very hard and severe
   language in their dealings with the people, in order, by inspiring them
   with terror, to break and subdue their rebellion; but whenever they see
   men humbled, they immediately address them in words of consolation,
   which, however, would be no consolation at all, were they not
   encouraged to hope for future deliverance.

   The question may here be asked, whether God, with the view of assuaging
   the sadness arising from the chastisement, which he inflicted, always
   determined the number of years and days during which they would last?
   To this I answer, that although the prophets have not always marked out
   and defined a fixed time, yet they frequently gave the people assurance
   that deliverance was near at hand; and, moreover, all of them spoke of
   the future restoration of the Church. If it is again objected, that the
   people in their affliction did wrong in not applying to themselves the
   general promises, which it is certain were the common property of all
   ages, I answer, that as it was God's usual way to send in every
   affliction a messenger to announce the tidings of deliverance, the
   people, when at the present time no prophet appeared to be expressly
   sent for that purpose, not without cause complain that they were
   deprived of the signs of the Divine favor which they had been
   accustomed to enjoy. Until the coming of Christ it was highly necessary
   that the memory of the promised deliverance should be renewed in every
   age, to show the people of God that to whatever afflictions they might
   be subjected, he still continued to care for them, and would afford
   them succor.

   10. How long, O God! shall the adversary reproach? Here it is intimated
   that nothing inflicted upon them greater anguish than when they saw the
   name of God blasphemed by the ungodly. By this manner of praying, the
   object of the inspired writer was to kindle in our hearts a zeal for
   maintaining the Divine glory. We are naturally too delicate and tender
   for bearing calamities; but it is a decided proof of genuine godliness,
   when the contumely which is cast upon God grieves and disquiets our
   minds more than all our own personal sufferings. The poor Jews, there
   can be no doubt, were assailed with more kinds of reproach than one
   under a most cruel tyrant, and amongst a barbarous nation. But the
   prophet, speaking in the person of the whole Church, makes almost no
   account of the reproaches cast upon the people in comparison of the
   execrable blasphemies directed against God; according to the statement
   contained in Psalm 69:9, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee
   are fallen upon me." The phrase for ever is again added; for when the
   ungodly continue long unpunished, this has a hardening effect, and
   renders them more audacious, especially when the revilings which they
   pour forth against God seem to pass unnoticed by him. It is, therefore,
   added immediately after in the 11th verse,

   11. How long wilt thou withdraw thy hand? It is easy to see what the
   prophet here intends, and yet interpreters are not agreed as to the
   words. Some by the word hand, in the first part of the verse,
   understand the left hand, to distinguish it from the right hand,
   mentioned in the last clause of the verse. But this is mere trifling;
   for when he uses the term right hand, he simply repeats the same thing
   according to his usual manner. Some translate the verb klh, kalah, the
   last word of the verse, by hinder or restrain, as if the prophet had
   said, Do thou at length stretch forth thy hand, which has been kept too
   long in thy bosom. But this is a forced sense, to which they have
   recourse without any color of reason. Those who translate it consume
   understand the midst of God's bosom, as denoting allegorically his
   temple, [228] an interpretation of which I cannot approve. It will be
   better to continue the interrogation to the last word in this way: "How
   long wilt thou withdraw thy hand? Yea, wilt thou withdraw it from the
   midst of thy bosom? Consume, therefore, these ungodly men who so
   proudly despise thee." We may also not improperly view the words as a
   prayer that as God's enemies persuaded themselves that he was slothful
   and idle, because he did not bestir himself, nor openly lift up his
   hand; he would cause them to feel that he was perfectly able to destroy
   them with his nod alone, although he should not move so much as a
   finger.

   12. But God is my King from the beginning. In this verse, as we have
   often seen to be the case in other places, the people of God
   intermingle meditations with their prayers, thereby to acquire renewed
   vigor to their faith, and to stir up themselves to greater earnestness
   in the duty of prayer. We know how difficult it is to rise above all
   doubts, and boldly to persevere in a free and unrestrained course of
   prayer. Here, then, the faithful call to remembrance the proofs of
   God's mercy and working, by which he certified, through a continued
   series of ages, that he was the King and Protector of the people whom
   he had chosen. By this example we are taught, that as it is not enough
   to pray with the lips unless we also pray in faith, we ought always to
   remember the benefits by which God has given a confirmation of his
   fatherly love towards us, and should regard them as so many testimonies
   of his electing love. It is quite clear that the title King, which is
   here applied to God, ought not to be restricted merely to his
   sovereignty. He is addressed by this appellation because he had taken
   upon him the government of the Jewish people, in order to preserve and
   maintain them in safety. We have already stated what is implied in the
   words, from the beginning. By the midst of the earth some think that
   Judea is intended, because it was situated as it were in the midst of
   the habitable globe. There is no doubt that it is to be understood of a
   place which stands prominently in view. We find the expression used in
   this sense in these words which God commanded Moses to speak to
   Pharaoh,

   "And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people
   dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest
   know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth,"
   (Exodus 8:22.)

   The simple and natural meaning, therefore, is, that God had wrought in
   behalf of the chosen people many deliverances, which were as open and
   manifest as if they had been exhibited on a conspicuous theater.

   Psalm 74:13-17

   13. Thou hast divided the sea by thy [229] power: thou hast broken the
   heads of the dragons [230] upon the waters. 14. Thou hast broken the
   head [231] of Leviathan [232] in pieces, and hast given him for food to
   thy people in the wilderness. 15. Thou hast cleaved [or divided] the
   fountain and the torrent: thou hast dried up mighty rivers. 16. The day
   is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast ordained [233] the light
   [234] and the sun. 17. Thou hast set [or fixed] all the boundaries of
   the earth: thou hast made the summer and the winter.


   13. Thou hast divided the sea by thy power. The prophet now collects
   together certain kinds of deliverances highly worthy of remembrance;
   all of them, however, belonging to the first deliverance by which God
   emancipated his people from the tyranny of Egypt. We will find him
   afterwards descending to the general commendation of the goodness of
   God which is diffused through the whole world. Thus from the special
   grace which God vouchsafes to his Church, he passes on to speak of the
   good-will which he displays towards all mankind. In the first place, he
   says, Thou hast divided, or cleaved, the sea. Some think that the
   following clause is subjoined as an effect of what is stated in the
   first clause, -- God, by drying up the sea, having caused the whales
   and other great fishes to die. I am, however, of opinion, that it is to
   be taken metaphorically for Pharaoh and his army; this mode of
   expression being very common among the prophets, especially when they
   speak of the Egyptians, whose country was washed by a sea abounding
   with fish, and divided by the Nile. Pharaoh is, therefore, not
   improperly termed Leviathan, [235] on account of the advantages of the
   sea possessed by his country, and because, in reigning over that land
   with great splendor, he might be compared to a whale moving up and down
   at its ease in the midst of the waters of the mighty ocean. [236] As
   God put forth his power at that time for the deliverance of the people,
   to assure the Church that he would always be her protector and the
   guardian of her welfare, the encouragement afforded by this example
   ought not to be limited exclusively to one age. It is, therefore, with
   good reason applied to the descendants of that ancient race, that they
   might improve it as a means of confirming and establishing their faith.
   The prophet does not here recount all the miracles which God had
   wrought at the departure of the people from the land of Egypt; but in
   adverting to some of them, he comprehends by the figure synecdoche, all
   that Moses has narrated concerning them at greater length. When he says
   that leviathan was given for food to the Israelites, and that even in
   the wilderness, [237] there is a beautiful allusion to the destruction
   of Pharaoh and his host. It is as if he had said, that then a bountiful
   provision of victuals was laid up for the nourishment of the people;
   for when their enemies were destroyed, the quiet and security which the
   people in consequence enjoyed served, so to speak, as food to prolong
   their life. By the wilderness, is not meant the countries lying on the
   sea coast, though they are dry and barren, but the deserts at a great
   distance from the sea. The same subject is prosecuted in the following
   verse, where it is declared, that the fountain was cleaved or divided,
   that is, it was so when God caused a stream of water to gush from the
   rock to supply the wants of the people. [238] Finally, it is added,
   that mighty rivers [239] were dried up, an event which happened when
   God caused the waters of the Jordan to turn back to make a way for his
   people to pass over. Some would have the Hebrew word 'ytn, ethan, which
   signifies mighty, to be a proper name, as if the correct translation
   were rivers of Ethan; but this interpretation is altogether without
   foundation.

   16. The day is thine, the night also is thine. The prophet now descends
   to the consideration of the divine benefits which are extended in
   common to all mankind. Having commenced with the special blessings by
   which God manifested himself to be the Father of his chosen people, he
   now aptly declares that God exercises his beneficence towards the whole
   human family. He teaches us, that it is not by chance that the days and
   nights succeed each other in regular succession, but that this order
   was established by the appointment of God. The secondary cause of these
   phenomena is added, being that arrangement by which God has invested
   the sun with the power and office of illuminating the earth; for after
   having spoken of the light he adds the sun, as the principal means of
   communicating it, and, so to speak, the chariot in which it is brought
   when it comes to show itself to men. [240] As then the incomparable
   goodness of God towards the human race clearly shines forth in this
   beautiful arrangement, the prophet justly derives from it an argument
   for strengthening and establishing his trust in God.

   17. Thou hast fixed [241] all the boundaries of the earth. What is here
   stated concerning the boundaries or limits assigned to the earth, and
   concerning the regular and successive recurrence of summer and winter
   every year, is to the same effect as the preceding verse. It is
   doubtful whether the prophet means the uttermost ends of the world, or
   whether he speaks of the particular boundaries by which countries are
   separate from each other. Although the latter are often disturbed by
   the violence of men, whose insatiable cupidity and ambition cannot be
   restrained by any of the lines of demarcation which exist in the world,
   but are always endeavoring to break through them; [242] yet God
   manifests his singular goodness in assigning to each nation its own
   territory upon which to dwell. I am, however, rather of opinion, that
   the clause is to be understood of those bounds which cannot be
   confounded at the will of men, and consider the meaning to be, that God
   has allotted to men as much space of earth as he has seen to be
   sufficient for them to dwell upon. Farther, the well regulated
   successions of summer and winter clearly indicate with what care and
   benignity God has provided for the necessities of the human family.
   From this, the prophet justly concludes, that nothing is more
   improbable than that God should neglect to act the part of a father
   towards his own flock and household.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [229] There is here a change of person, and a transition from the
   narrative form of speech to the apostrophe, which give animation to the
   composition, and enhances its poetical beauty.

   [230] The word tnynym, thanninim, for dragons, is used by the sacred
   writers somewhat indeterminately, and translators render it variously,
   as by whales, serpents, dragons, crocodiles, and other sea-monsters.
   (See Genesis 1:21; Exodus 7:12; Deuteronomy 32:33; and Psalm 148:7.) We
   cannot now ascertain what particular animal is in each case denoted,
   and it may very probably be merely a general term equivalent to our
   word "monster," for any strange and prodigious creature. tnynym,
   thanninim, is here explained by Williams as denoting "sea-monsters or
   large serpents." "What animal is meant by this name," says Mant, "is
   not well ascertained. But it seems to have been some aquatic or
   amphibious creature commonly known in the neighborhood of Egypt, but
   not the crocodile, as that is noticed under a different name in the
   following verse." By the dragons the Egyptian people may be intended.

   [231] In the Hebrew it is "the heads."

   [232] "C'est, le plus grand monstre marin qui soit." -- Fr. marg. "That
   is, the greatest sea-monster which exists."

   [233] "Ou, establi." -- Fr. marg. "Or, established."

   [234] m'vr, maor, here rendered the light, from 'vr, or, to shine,
   signifies in general any luminary or receptacle of light; the sun or
   the moon indiscriminately. See Genesis 1:16. But being here joined with
   and opposed to the sun, as the night is to the day in the preceding
   clause, it has been supposed to signify the moon, the luminary of the
   night, as the sun is that of the day. The Chaldee, the LXX., the
   Syriac, and Arabic, render it the moon The Vulgate has "auroram," "the
   morning."

   [235] Calvin supposes that the whale is the animal here referred to,
   and this was the opinion for a long time universally held. But from a
   comparison of the description given by Job of the Leviathan (Job 41)
   with what is known of the natural history of the crocodile, there can
   be little doubt that the crocodile is the Leviathan of Scripture. This
   is now very generally agreed upon. "Almost all the oldest
   commentators," says Dr Good, "I may say unconditionally all of them
   concurred in regarding the whale as the animal" intended by the
   Leviathan. "Beza and Diodati were among the first to interpret it the
   crocodile.' And Bochart has since supported this last rendering with a
   train of argument, which has nearly overwhelmed all opposition, and has
   brought almost every commentator over to his opinion." -- Dr Good's New
   Translation of Job "With respect to the Leviathan," says Fry, "all are
   now pretty well agreed that it can apply only to the crocodile, and
   probably it was nothing but a defective knowledge of the language of
   the book of Job, or of the natural history of this stupendous animal,
   which led former commentators to imagine the description applicable to
   any other." -- Fry's New Translation and Exposition of the Book of Job
   This Egyptian animal, the crocodile of the Nile, as we have formerly
   observed, (p. 38, note,) was anciently employed as a symbol of the
   Egyptian power, or of their king. Parkhurst remarks that in
   Scheuchzer's Physica Sacra may be seen a medal with Julius Caesar's
   head on one side, and on the reverse a crocodile with this inscription,
   -- Ægypte Capta, Egypt Taken. This strengthens the conclusion that the
   crocodile is the animal intended by the name Leviathan. Both the
   etymology of the name Leviathan, and to what language it belongs,
   according to Simonis, are unknown. But according to Gesenius it
   signifies "properly the twisted animal." It is affirmed by the Arabic
   lexicographers quoted by Bochart, (Phaleg Lib. 1, cap. 15,) that
   Pharaoh in the Egyptian language signified a crocodile; and if so,
   there may be some such allusion to his name in this passage, and in
   Ezekiel 29:3, and 32:2, where the king of Egypt is represented by the
   same animal, as was made to the name of Draco, when Herodicus (in a
   sarcasm recorded by Aristotle, Rhet Lib. 2, cap. 23) said that his
   laws, -- which were very severe, -- were the laws ouk anthropou alla
   drakontos, non hominis sed draconis. -- Merrick's Annotations "The
   heads of Leviathan" may denote the princes of Egypt, or the leaders of
   the Egyptian armies.

   [236] "Regnoit en grand triomphe, comme la balene se pourmene a sou
   aise au milieu de ce grande amas d'eaux." -- Fr.

   [237] Calvin reads, "thy people in the wilderness." But thy has nothing
   to represent it in the original, which literally is, "to a people, to
   those of the wilderness." Those who adopt this rendering are not agreed
   as to what is to be understood by the expression. Some think it means
   the birds and beasts of prey, who devoured the dead bodies of Pharaoh
   and the Egyptian army, when cast upon the coast of the Red Sea by the
   tides. See Exodus 14:30. If such is the meaning, these birds and beasts
   of prey are called "the people of wilderness," as being its principal
   inhabitants. That m, am, people, is sometimes to be thus interpreted in
   Scripture is evident from Proverbs 30:25, 26, where both the ants and
   the conies are styled a people But as the desert on the coast of which
   the Egyptians were thrown up was inhabited by tribes of people who
   lived on fishes -- even on those of the largest kind, which they found
   cast upon the shore by the tides -- and were from thence called
   Ichthuophagoi, or fish-eaters; some interpreters suppose that these are
   "the people of the wilderness" here mentioned; and that as Pharaoh and
   his host are represented under the figure of the Leviathan and other
   monsters of the deep, so these people, in allusion to their common way
   of living, are figuratively said to have preyed on their dead bodies,
   by which is understood their enriching themselves with their spoils.

   [238] "Quand Dieu feit que de la roche saillit un cours d'eau pour la
   necessite du peuple." -- Fr.

   [239] It is rivers in the plural, from which it would appear that the
   Jordan was not the only river which was dried up, to give an easy
   passage to the Israelites. The Chaldee specifies the Arnon, the Jabbok,
   and the Jordan, as the rivers here referred to. With respect to the
   Jordan, see Joshua 3:16. As to the miraculous drying up either of the
   Arnon or the Jabbok, we have no distinct account in Scripture. But in
   Numbers 21, after it is mentioned, verse 13, that the Israelites
   "pitched on the other side of Arnon," it follows, verses 14, 15,
   "Wherefore, it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he did
   in the Red Sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, and at the stream of the
   brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border
   of Moab." From this it would appear that God wrought at "the brooks of
   Arnon, and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling
   of Ar," miracles similar to that which was wrought at the Red Sea, when
   it was divided to open up a passage for the chosen tribes.

   Psalm 74:18-23

   18. Remember this: the adversary hath blasphemed Jehovah: and a
   worthless people hath done despite to thy name. 19. Give not to the
   beast the soul of thy turtle dove: forget not the congregation of thy
   poor ones for ever. 20. Have regard to thy covenant: for the dark
   places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence. 21. Let
   not him who is oppressed [or afflicted] return ashamed: let the poor
   and needy one praise thy name. 22. Arise, O God! Plead thy cause:
   remember thy reproach, which is done to thee by the foolish man daily.
   23. Forget not the voice of thy adversaries: the tumult of those who
   rise up against thee ascendeth continually.


   18. Remember this. The prophet having encouraged the hearts of the
   godly by magnifying the divine power and goodness, now returns to the
   prosecution of his prayer. He first complains that the enemies of his
   people revile God, and yet continue unpunished. When he says, Remember
   this, the manner of expression is emphatic; and the occasion demanded
   it, for it is not a crime of small magnitude to treat with contumely
   the sacred name of God. For the sake of contrast, he states that it was
   a worthless or foolish people who thus presumed insolently to pour
   forth their reproaches against God. The Hebrew word nvl, nabal, denotes
   not only a foolish man, but also a wicked and infamous person. The
   prophet, therefore, justly describes the despisers of God as people who
   are vile and worthless.

   19. Give not to the beast the soul of thy turtle dove. The Hebrew word
   chyt, chayath, which we translate beast, signifies sometimes the soul
   or life, and so some explain it in the second clause of this verse,
   where it again occurs. But it is here unquestionably to be taken either
   for a wild beast or for a multitude. Understood in either of these
   ways, this form of expression will contain a very apposite comparison
   between the life of a weak and timorous bird, and a powerful army of
   men, or a cruel beast. The Church is compared to a turtle dove [243]
   for, although the faithful consisted of a considerable number, yet so
   far were they from matching their enemies, that, on the contrary, they
   were exposed to them as a prey. It is next added, Forget not the soul
   or congregation of thy poor ones The Hebrew word chyt, chayath, is
   again employed, and there is an elegance when, on account of its
   ambiguity, it is used twice in the same verse, but in different senses.
   I have preferred translating it congregation, rather than soul, because
   the passage seems to be a prayer that it would please God to watch over
   and defend his own small flock from the mighty hosts of their enemies.

   20. Have regard to thy covenant. That God may be the more inclined to
   show mercy, the prophet brings to his remembrance the Divine covenant;
   even as the refuge of the saints, when they have found themselves
   involved in extreme dangers, has always been to hope for deliverance,
   because God had promised, in the covenant which he made with them, to
   be a father to then, From this we learn, that the only firm support on
   which our prayers can rest is, that God has adopted us to be his people
   by his free choice. Whence, also, it appears how devilish was the
   phrensy of that filthy dog Servetus, who was not ashamed to affirm that
   it is foolish, and gross mockery, to lay before God his own promises
   when we are engaged in prayer. Farther, the godly Jews again show us
   how severely they were afflicted, when they declare that violence and
   oppression were everywhere prevalent; as if all places were the haunts
   of cut-throats and the dens of robbers. [244] It is said the dark
   places of the earth; for, whenever God seems to hide his face, the
   wicked imagine that whatever wickedness they may commit, they will
   find, wherever they may be, hiding-places by which to cover it all.

   21. Let not him who is oppressed return with shame. The word return, as
   it has a reference to God, is equivalent to the expression, to go away
   empty. The faithful, then, beseech Him that they may not be put to
   shame by suffering a repulse at his hands. They call themselves
   afflicted, poor, and needy, as an argument to obtain the Divine favor
   and mercy. It is, however, to be observed, that they do not speak
   insincerely, nor give an exaggerated representation of their
   distresses, but intimate, that by so many calamities they were brought
   to such a low condition, that there no longer remained for them any
   quarter in the world from which they could expect any help. By this
   example, we are taught that when we are reduced to the greatest
   extremity, there is a remedy always ready for our misery, in calling
   upon God.

   22. Arise, O God! plead thy cause. The pious Jews again supplicate God
   to ascend into his judgment-seat. He is then said to arise, when, after
   having long exercised forbearance, he shows, in very deed, that he has
   not forgotten his office as judge. To induce him to undertake this
   cause the more readily, they call upon him to maintain his own right.
   Lord, as if they had said, since the matter in hand is what peculiarly
   concerns thyself; it is not time for thee to remain inactive. They
   declare, at the same time, how this was, in a special sense, the cause
   of God. It was so, because the foolish people daily cast reproaches
   upon him. We may here again translate the word nvl, nabal, the
   worthless people, instead of the foolish people. The wickedness charged
   against the persons spoken of is aggravated from the circumstance,
   that, not content with reproaching God on one occasion, they continued
   their derision and mockery without intermission. For this reason, the
   faithful conclude by invoking God that he would not forget such
   heaven-daring conduct in men who not only had the audacity to reproach
   his majesty, but who fiercely and outrageously poured forth their
   blasphemies against him. They seemed, it is true, to do this
   indirectly; but, as they despised God, it is asserted that they rose up
   against him with reckless and infatuated presumption, after the manner
   of the Giants of old, and that their haughtiness was carried to the
   greatest excess.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [243] As none of the ancient versions have "turtle dove," and as the
   reading of the LXX. is, exomologoumenen soi, confessing thee, it has
   been thought by some in a high degree probable that the word tvrk,
   torecha, thy turtle dove in our present Hebrew copies, should be tvdk,
   todecha, confessing thee; an error which transcribers might easily have
   committed, by writing r, resh, instead of d, daleth Houbigant, who
   approves of this opinion, boldly pronounces the other, which represents
   the people of God under the figure of a turtle dove, to be "putidum et
   aliunde conquisitum." But, says Archbishop Secker, "Turtle dove, which
   Houbigant calls putidum, should not be called so, considering that,
   yvnty, Cant. 2, 14, is the same thing." The passage, as it now stands,
   agrees with other texts of Scripture which represent the people of God
   under the image of a bird, Numbers 24:21; Jeremiah 22:23; 48:28. The
   turtle dove is a defenceless, solitary, timid, and mournful creature,
   equally destitute of skill and courage to defend itself from the
   rapacious birds of prey which thirst for its blood. And this gives a
   very apt and affecting representation of the state of the Church when
   this psalm was written. She was in a weak, helpless, and sorrowful
   condition, in danger of being speedily devoured by the inveterate and
   implacable enemies, who, like birds of prey, were besetting her on all
   sides, eagerly intent upon her destruction. "With the most plaintive
   earnestness she pleads her cause with the Almighty, through this and
   the following verses; continually growing more importunate in her
   petitions as the danger increases. While speaking, she seems in the
   last verse to hear the tumultuous clamours of the approaching enemy
   growing every minute louder as they advance; and we leave the turtle
   dove' without the Divine assistance, ready to sink under the talons of
   the rapacious eagle." -- Mant "The Psalmist's expression, thy turtle
   dove, may perhaps be farther illustrated from the custom, ancient and
   modern, of keeping doves as favourite birds, (see Theocritus, 5. 96;
   and Virgil, Eclog. 3, 5, 68, 69,) and from the care taken to secure
   them from such animals as are dangerous to them." -- Merrick's
   Annotations.

   [244] "The caves, dens, woods, etc., of the land, are full of robbers,
   cut-throats, and murderers, who are continually destroying thy people;
   so that the holy seed seems as if it would be entirely cut off, and the
   covenant promise thus rendered void." -- Dr Adam Clarke. "For the dark
   places of the earth, i.e., the caverns of Judea, are full of the
   habitations of violence, i.e., of men who live by rapine. Some,
   however, by the dark places of the earth, understand the seat of the
   captivity of the Jews." -- Cresswell.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [211] This is the opinion of Calmet, Poole, Wells, Mant, Walford, and
   others. "A melancholy occasion," says Mant, "commemorated by an elegy
   of corresponding tenderness and plaintiveness. It would be difficult to
   name a finer specimen of elegiac poetry than this pathetic psalm of
   Asaph." If it was composed during the Babylonish captivity, and if
   Asaph, whose name is in the title, was the author of it, he must have
   been a different person from David's contemporary, previously noticed,
   (volume 2, page 257, note,) -- probably a descendant of the same name
   and family. Dr Gill thinks that he was the Asaph of the time of David,
   and supposes that under the influence of the spirit of prophecy, he
   might speak of the sufferings of the Church in after ages, just as
   David and others testified before-hand of the sufferings of Christ and
   the glory that should follow.

   [212] Rosenmüller is of opinion that this is the period referred to.
   "For my part," says Dr Geddes, "I think it must have been composed
   during the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes; and the best commentary
   on it is the first chapter of the first book of Maccabees. The author
   may have been Mattathias."

   PSALM 75

   It affords matter of rejoicing and thanksgiving to the whole Church, to
   reflect that the world is governed exclusively according to the will of
   God, and that she herself is sustained by his grace and power alone.
   Encouraged by this consideration, she triumphs over the proud despisers
   of God, who, by their infatuated presumption, are driven headlong into
   all manner of excess.

   Psalm 75:1-7

   1. We will praise thee, O God! we will praise thee: and [245] thy name
   is near: they will declare [or recount [246] ] thy wondrous works. 2.
   When I shall have taken the congregation, [247] I will judge
   righteously. [248] 3. The earth is dissolved, and all its inhabitants:
   I will establish [249] the pillars of it. 4. I said to the fools, Act
   not foolishly: and to the ungodly, Lift not up the horn. 5. Lift not up
   your horn on high; and speak not with a stiff neck. 6. For exaltations
   come neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the wilderness.
   [250] 7. For God is judge: [251] he bringeth low, and he setteth up.


   1. We will praise thee, O God! With respect to the inscription of this
   psalm, I have sufficiently spoken when explaining the 57th psalm. As to
   the author of it, this is a point, in the determination of which, I am
   not inclined to give myself much trouble. Whoever he was, whether David
   or some other prophet, he breaks forth at the very commencement into
   the language of joy and thanksgiving: We will praise thee, O God! we
   will praise thee. The repetition serves the more forcibly to express
   his strong affection and his ardent zeal in singing the praises of God.
   The verbs in the Hebrew are in the past tense; but the subject of the
   psalm requires that they should be translated into the future; which
   may be done in perfect consistency with the idiom of the Hebrew
   language. The inspired writer, however, may declare that God had been
   praised among his people for the benefits which he had bestowed in the
   times of old, the design being thereby to induce God to persevere in
   acting in the same manner, that thus continuing like himself, he might
   from time to time afford his people new matter for celebrating his
   praises. The change of the person in the concluding part of the verse
   has led some interpreters to supply the relative pronoun 'sr, asher,
   who, as if the reading were, O Lord! we will praise thee; and thy name
   is near to those who declare thy wondrous works [252] But the prophet,
   I have no doubt, puts the verb they will declare, indefinitely, that is
   to say, without determining the person; [253] and he has used the
   copula and instead of the causal participle for, as is frequently done.
   His meaning, then, may be brought out very appropriately th We will
   praise thee, O God! for thy name is near; and, therefore, thy wondrous
   works shall be declared. He, no doubt, means that the same persons whom
   he said would celebrate the praise of God, would be the publishers of
   his wonderful works. And, certainly, God, in displaying his power,
   opens the mouths of his servants to recount his works. In short, the
   design is to intimate that there is just ground for praising God, who
   shows himself to be at hand to afford succor to his people. The name of
   God, as is well known, is taken for his power; and his presence, or
   nearness, is judged of by the assistance which he grants to his people
   in the time of their need.

   2. When I shall have taken the congregation. The Hebrew verb yd, yaäd,
   signifies to appoint a place or day, and the noun mvd, moed, derived
   from it, which is here used, signifies both holy assemblies, or a
   congregation of the faithful assembled together in the name of the
   Lord, and festival, or appointed solemn days. As it is certain that God
   is here introduced as speaking, either of these senses will agree with
   the scope of the passage. It may be viewed as denoting either that
   having gathered his people to himself, he will restore to due order
   matters which were in a state of distraction and confusion, or else
   that he will make choice of a fit time for exercising his judgment. In
   abandoning his people for a season to the will of their enemies, he
   seems to forsake them and to exercise no care about them; so that they
   are like a flock of sheep which is scattered, and wanders hither and
   thither without a shepherd. It being his object, then, to convey in
   these words a promise that he would remedy such a confused state of
   things, he very properly commences with the gathering together of his
   Church. If any choose rather to understand the word mvd, moed, as
   referring to time [254] God is to be understood as admonishing his
   people, that it is their bounden duty to exercise patience until he
   actually show that the proper time is come for correcting vices, since
   he only has the years and days in his own power, and knows best the fit
   juncture and moment for performing this work. The interpretation to
   which I most incline is, That, to determine the end and measure of
   calamities, and the best season of rising up for the deliverance of his
   people, -- matters, the determination of which men would willingly
   claim for themselves, -- is reserved by God in his own hands, and is
   entirely subject to his own will. At the same time, I am very well
   satisfied with the former interpretation, which refers the passage to
   the gathering together of the Church. Nor ought it to seem absurd or
   harsh that God is here introduced as returning an answer to the prayers
   of his people. This graphic representation, by which they are made to
   speak in the first verse, while he is introduced as speaking in the
   second, is much more forcible than if the prophet had simply said, that
   God would at length, and at the determined time, show himself to be the
   protector of his Church, and gather her together again when she should
   be scattered and rent in pieces. The amount, in short, is, that
   although God may not succor his own people immediately, yet he never
   forgets them, but only delays until the fit time arrive, the redress
   which he has in readiness for them. To judge righteously, is just to
   restore to a better state matters which are embroiled and disordered.
   Thus Paul says,

   "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
   them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled rest with us, when
   the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels."
   (2 Thessalonians 1:6, 7)

   God, therefore, declares that it is his office to set in order and
   adjust those things which are in confusion, that, entertaining this
   expectation, we may be sustained and comforted by means of it in all
   our afflictions.

   3. The earth is dissolved, and all its inhabitants. Many commentators
   are of opinion that these words are properly applicable to Christ, at
   whose coming it behoved the earth and its inhabitants to be shaken. He
   reigns, as we know, that he may destroy the old man, and he commences
   his spiritual kingdom with the destruction of the flesh; but he
   conducts his administration in such a manner as that afterwards there
   follows the restoration of the new man. Of the second part of the
   verse, I will establish the pillars of it, they make the same
   application, explaining it as if Christ had said, As soon as I come
   into the world, the earth with its inhabitants shall melt and be
   dissolved; but immediately after I will establish it upon firm and
   solid foundations; for my elect ones, renewed by my Spirit, shall no
   longer be like grass or withered flowers, but shall have conferred upon
   them new and unwonted stability. I do not, however, think that such a
   refined interpretation ever entered into the mind of the prophet, whose
   words I consider as simply meaning, that although the earth may be
   dissolved, God has the props or supports of it in his own hand. This
   verse is connected with the preceding; for it confirms the truth that
   God in due time will manifest himself to be an impartial and righteous
   judge; it being an easy matter for him, although the whole fabric of
   the world were fallen into ruins, to rebuild it from its decayed
   materials. At the same time, I have no doubt that there is a reference
   to the actual state of things in the natural world. The earth occupies
   the lowest place in the celestial sphere, and yet instead of having
   foundations on which it is supported, is it not rather suspended in the
   midst of the air? Besides, since so many waters penetrate and pass
   through its veins, would it not be dissolved were it not established by
   the secret power of God? While, however, the prophet alludes to the
   natural state of the earth, he, nevertheless, rises higher, teaching
   us, that were the world even in ruins, it is in the power of God to
   re-establish it.

   4. I said to the fools, Act not foolishly. [255] After he has set the
   office of God full in his own view and in the view of the faithful, he
   now triumphs over all the ungodly, whom he impeaches of madness and
   blind rage, the effect of their despising God, which leads them to
   indulge to excess in pride and self-gloriation. This holy boasting to
   which he gives utterance depends upon the judgment, which in the name
   of God he denounced to be at hand; for when the people of God expect
   that he is coming to execute judgment, and are persuaded that he will
   not long delay his coming, they glory even in the midst of their
   oppressions. The madness of the wicked may boil over and swell with
   rage, and pour forth floods to overwhelm them; but it is enough for
   them to know that their life is protected by the power of God, who can
   with the most perfect ease humble all pride, and restrain the most
   daring and presumptuous attempts. The faithful here deride and despise
   whatever the wicked plot and conspire to execute, and bid them desist
   from their madness; and in calling upon them to do this, they intimate
   that they are making all this stir and commotion in vain, resembling
   madmen, who are drawn hither and thither by their own distempered
   imaginations. It is to be observed, that the Psalmist represents pride
   as the cause or mother of all rash and audacious enterprises. The
   reason why men rush with such recklessness upon unlawful projects most
   certainly is, that blinded by pride, they form an undue and exaggerated
   estimate of their own power. This being a malady which is not easily
   eradicated from the hearts of men, the admonition, Lift not up your
   horn on high [256] is repeated once and again. They are next enjoined
   not to speak with a fat or a stiff neck; by which is meant that they
   should not speak harshly and injuriously; [257] for it is usual with
   proud persons to erect the neck and raise the head when they pour forth
   their menaces. Others translate the words, Speak not stiffly with your
   neck; but the other translation is the more correct.

   6. For exaltations come neither from the east nor from the west. [258]
   The prophet here furnishes an admirable remedy for correcting pride,
   when he teaches us that promotion or advancement proceeds not from the
   earth but from God alone. That which most frequently blinds the eyes of
   men is, their gazing about on the right hand and on the left, and their
   gathering together from all quarters riches and other resources, that,
   strengthened with these, they may be able to gratify their desires and
   lusts. The prophet, therefore, affirms, that in not rising above the
   world, they are laboring under a great mistake, since it is God alone
   who has the power to exalt and to abase. "This," it may be said, "seems
   to be at variance with common experience, it being the fact, that the
   majority of men who attain to the highest degrees of honor, owe their
   elevation either to their own policy and underhand dealing, or to
   popular favor and partiality, or to other means of an earthly kind.
   What is brought forward as the reason of this assertion, God is judge,
   seems also to be unsatisfactory." I answer, that although many attain
   to exalted stations either by unlawful arts, or by the aid of worldly
   instrumentality, yet that does not happen by chance; such persons being
   advanced to their elevated position by the secret purpose of God, that
   forthwith he may scatter them like refuse or chaff. The prophet does
   not simply attribute judgment to God. He also defines what kind of
   judgment it is, affirming it to consist in this, that, casting down one
   man and elevating another to dignity, he orders the affairs of the
   human race as seemeth good in his sight. I have stated that the
   consideration of this is the means by which haughty spirits are most
   effectually humbled; for the reason why worldly men have the daring to
   attempt whatever comes into their minds is, because they conceive of
   God as shut up in heaven, and think not that they are kept under
   restraint by his secret providence. In short, they would divest him of
   all sovereign power, that they might find a free and an unimpeded
   course for the gratification of their lusts. To teach us then, with all
   moderation and humility, to remain contented with our own condition,
   the Psalmist clearly defines in what the judgment of God, or the order
   which he observes in the government of the world, consists, telling us
   that it belongs to him alone to exalt or to abase those of mankind whom
   he pleases.

   From this it follows that all those who, spreading the wings of their
   vanity, aspire after any kind of exaltation, without any regard to or
   dependence upon God, are chargeable with robbing him as much as in them
   lies of his prerogative and power. This is very apparent, not only from
   their frantic counsels, but also from the blasphemous boastings in
   which they indulge, saying, Who shall hinder me? What shall withstand
   me? as if, forsooth! it were not an easy matter for God, with his nod
   alone, suddenly to cast a thousand obstacles in their way, with which
   to render ineffectual all their efforts. As worldly men by their
   fool-hardihood and perverse devices are chargeable with endeavoring to
   despoil God of his royal dignity, so whenever we are dismayed at their
   threatenings, we are guilty of wickedly setting limits to the
   sovereignty and power of God. If, whenever we hear the wind blowing
   with any degree of violence, [259] we are as much frightened as if we
   were stricken with a thunderbolt from heaven, such extreme readiness to
   be thrown into a state of consternation manifestly shows that we do not
   as yet thoroughly understand the nature of that government which God
   exercises over the world. We would, no doubt, be ashamed to rob him of
   the title of judge; yea, there is almost no individual who would not
   shrink with horror at the thought of so great a blasphemy; and yet,
   when our natural understanding has extorted from us the confession that
   he is the judge and the supreme ruler of the world, we conceive of him
   as holding only a kind of inactive sovereignty, which I know not how to
   characterise, as if he did not govern mankind by his power and wisdom.
   But the man who believes it to be an established principle that God
   disposes of all men as seemeth good in his sight, and shapes to every
   man his condition in this world, will not stop at earthly means: he
   will look above and beyond these to God. The improvement which should
   be made of this doctrine is, that the godly should submit themselves
   wholly to God, and beware of being lifted up with vain confidence. When
   they see the impious waxing proud, let them not hesitate to despise
   their foolish and infatuated presumption. Again, although God has in
   his own hand sovereign power and authority, so that he can do whatever
   he pleases, yet he, is styled judge, to teach us that he governs the
   affairs of mankind with the most perfect equity. Whence it follows,
   that every man who abstains from inflicting injuries and committing
   deeds of mischief, may, when he is injured and treated unjustly, betake
   himself to the judgment-seat of God.

   practice among the Abyssinians, described by Mr Bruce, has been also
   adduced as throwing light upon this verse. He observes, that the
   governors of the provinces in Abyssinia wear a broad fillet round their
   heads, which is tied behind the head. In the middle of this fillet is a
   horn, or a conical piece of silver, gilded with gold; and shaped like
   our candle-extinguishers. This is called kirn or horn; and is only used
   in reviews or processions after victory. The way in which they throw
   back the head when wearing this ornament (lest it should fall forward)
   gives a stiffness to the position of the head; and this seems to
   explain the language of the Psalmist, when he mentions speaking with a
   stiff neck. Instead of with a stiff neck, Parkhurst translates with a
   retorted neck; observing, that "this is a well-known gesture of pride,
   contempt, or disdain."

   Psalm 75:8-10

   8. For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine is turbid,
   [or full of dregs: [260] ] it is full of mixture, and he shall pour
   forth of it: surely they shall wring out the dregs of it, and all the
   wicked of the earth shall drink of it. 9. But I will publish for ever,
   and will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 10. And I will break all the
   horns of the wicked: but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.


   8. For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup. [261] The Psalmist here
   applies more directly to the use of the godly that judgment of which he
   has just now spoken. He affirms, that the object for which God reigns
   is, that no iniquity may remain unpunished; but that when wicked men
   have broken through all restraint and abandoned themselves to
   wickedness, he may drag them to deserved punishment. From this we again
   learn what estimate we ought to form of the providence of God -- that
   we ought to regard it as exercising its control by an ever-present
   energy over every part of our life. It is therefore asserted that God
   has in his hand a cup with which to make the wicked drunk. The word
   chmr, chamar, signifies full of dregs, and also red. As red wine among
   the Jews was the strongest and sharpest, we may suppose that it is here
   referred to; and the similitude is very appropriate, which represents
   God as having in his hand wine of a highly intoxicating character, with
   which to make the ungodly drunk even to death. It is implied, that the
   swiftness of divine vengeance is incredible, resembling the rapidity
   and power with which strong wine penetrates to the brain, and either
   produces madness or kindles a fever. It is on this account said, that
   the wine in God's cup is of a red color; as it is said in Proverbs
   23:31,

   "Look not upon the wine when it is red in the cup."

   Nor is it any objection to this that it is described a little after as
   full of mixture. These two things do not ill agree with each other;
   first, that the wicked are suddenly made drunk with the vengeance of
   God; and, secondly, that they drink it out even to the dregs, until
   they perish. Some give a different explanation of the term mixture,
   considering, but without any just ground, the allusion to be to the
   custom which prevails in warm climates of diluting wine with water.
   This expression, it is full of mixture, was rather added to give
   additional force to the statement of the prophet; his object being to
   compare the vehemence and fury of God's wrath to spiced wine. [262] By
   these figures he intimates that it will be impossible for the ungodly
   to escape drinking the cup which God will put into their hands, and
   that they will be compelled to drain it to the last drop.

   9. and 10. But I will publish for ever. This conclusion of the psalm
   evinces the joy which God's people felt from having experienced that He
   was their deliverer in adversity; for it seems to be their own
   experience which they engage to publish, and on account of which they
   resolve to sing praise to God. Whence also they gather, that by the
   divine aid they will overcome all the power of the reprobate; and that
   being themselves possessed of righteousness and equity, they will be
   sufficiently armed for their own preservation and defense. The
   expression, the horns of the righteous shall be exalted, [263] implies,
   that the children of God, by a blameless and holy life, acquire greater
   strength, and more effectually protect themselves than if it were their
   endeavor to advance their own interests by every species of wickedness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [260] "Ou, rouge." -- Fr. marg. "Or, red."

   [261] "Here there seems to be an allusion to the cup of malediction, as
   the Jews called that mixed cup of wine' and frankincense, which used to
   be given to condemned criminals before their execution, in order to
   take away their senses. So the Chaldee Targum paraphrases the passage;
   Because a cup of malediction is in the hand of the Lord, and strong
   wine full of a mixture of bitterness, to take away the understanding of
   the wicked.'" -- Parkhurst quoted by Mant.

   [262] Mixed wine, naturally suggests to us the idea of wine weaker than
   in its pure state. Accordingly, Green, instead of "full of mixture,"
   translates "unmixed," by which he means wine unmixed with water. He
   perceived, what is evident at first sight, that wine of the strongest
   quality is intended, and having apparently no idea of any other mixture
   than that of water, which would weaken the wine, he took the liberty of
   rendering the words, ml' msk, male mesech, by "unmixed." The Greeks and
   Latins, in like manner by "mixed wine," understood wine diluted and
   weakened with water. But the phrase among the Hebrews generally denotes
   wine made stronger, by the addition of higher and more powerful
   ingredients. In the East, wines are much mixed with drugs of a
   stimulating and intoxicating kind; so that commonly when drawn from the
   vessels in which they are preserved, they are strained for use. What
   remains is the thick sediment of the strong and stimulating ingredients
   with which they had been mixed. This the wicked are doomed to drink.
   "The introduction of this circumstance," says Mant, "forms a fine
   climax, and carries the idea of God's indignation to the highest
   point." Some interpreters have explained the passage as meaning that
   God would pour out the pure and clear wine for his friends, while he
   would compel his enemies to drink the dregs. But the reference is
   entirely to his enemies, who were wholly to exhaust this cup of his
   fury. This, with the prophets, is a very common image of divine wrath.
   See [10]volume 2, page 399, note.

   [263] "By the horns of the wicked is signified pride; by the horns of
   the righteous, on the other hand, is meant their power. Basil has
   remarked, that the horn is more exalted and more solid than any other
   part of the body to which it belongs; and that, at the same time, it
   supplies ornament to the head, and is also a weapon of defense. Hence
   it is put metaphorically both for strength and power, and also for
   pride." -- Cresswell. Here it is threatened that the power and honor of
   the wicked, which had been employed as the instruments of cruel wrong
   and oppression, would be destroyed, and their pride effectually
   humbled; while the righteous would be exalted to power and dignity.

   PSALM 76

   There is here celebrated the grace and truth of God in having,
   according to his promise that he would be the protector of the city of
   Jerusalem, defended it by his wonderful power against enemies, who were
   renowned for their warlike valor, and well equipped with everything
   requisite for war. [264]

   To the chief musician upon Neginoth. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.

   This psalm, it is probable, was composed after the death of David; and,
   accordingly, some think that what is here described is that deliverance
   of the Jews from the Ammonites which took place in the reign of king
   Jehoshaphat. But I am rather inclined to adopt a different opinion, and
   to refer the psalm to that deliverance which they obtained from the
   Assyrians, recorded in 2 Kings 19. The Assyrians, under the conduct of
   Sennacherib, not only invaded Judea, but also made a violent assault
   upon the city of Jerusalem, the capital of the kingdom. The result of
   this is well known. They were compelled to raise the siege by the
   miraculous interference of God, who in one night destroyed that army
   with dreadful slaughter by the hand of his angel, (2 Kings 19:35.)
   [265] Hence the prophet, not inappropriately, affirms that God broke
   the arrows, the swords, and the shields. The point, however, which is
   chiefly necessary to be known and attended to is, that the continual
   care of God in defending the Church, which he has chosen, is here
   celebrated to encourage the faithful without any doubt or hesitation to
   glory in his protection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 76:1-6

   1. God is known in Judah; his name is great in Israel. 2. And his
   tabernacle was in Salem, and his dwelling-place in Zion. 3. There he
   broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle.
   Selah. 4. Thou art more glorious and terrible than the mountains of
   prey. 5. The stout hearted were spoiled, they slept their sleep, [266]
   and all the men of might have not found their hands. 6. At thy rebuke,
   O God of Jacob! the chariot and the horse were cast into a deep sleep.


   1. God is known in Judah. In the outset, we are taught that it was not
   by human means that the enemies of Israel were compelled to retire
   without accomplishing any thing, but by the ever-to-be-remembered aid
   of Jehovah. Whence came that knowledge of God and the greatness of his
   name which are spoken of, but because He stretched forth his hand in an
   extraordinary manner, to make it openly manifest that both the chosen
   people and the city were under his defense and protection? It is
   therefore asserted, that the glory of God was conspicuously displayed
   when the enemies of Israel were discomfited by such a miraculous
   interposition.

   2. And his tabernacle was in Salem Here the reason is assigned why God,
   putting the Assyrians to flight, vouchsafed to deliver the city of
   Jerusalem, and to take it under his protection. The reason is, because
   he had there chosen for himself a dwelling-place, in which his name was
   to be called upon. The amount, in short, is, first, that men had no
   ground to arrogate to themselves any share in the deliverance of the
   city here portrayed, God having strikingly showed that all the glory
   was his own, by displaying from heaven his power in the sight of all
   men; and, secondly, that he was induced to oppose his enemies from no
   other consideration but that of his free choice of the Jewish nation.
   God having, by this example, testified that his power is invincible for
   preserving his Church, it is a call and an encouragement to all the
   faithful to repose with confidence under his shadow. If his name is
   precious to himself, it is no ordinary pledge and security which he
   gives to our faith when he assures us that it is his will that the
   greatness of his power should be known in the preservation of his
   Church. Moreover, as the Church is a distinguished theater on which the
   Divine glory is displayed, we must always take the greatest care not to
   shroud or bury in forgetfulness, by our ingratitude, the benefits which
   have been bestowed upon it, and especially those which ought to be held
   in remembrance in all ages. Farther, although God is not now worshipped
   in the visible tabernacle, yet as by Christ he still dwells in the
   midst of us, yea even within us, we will doubtless experience, whenever
   we are exposed to danger, that under his protection we are in perfect
   safety. If the earthly sanctuary of Jerusalem afforded to God's ancient
   people succor while it stood, we may rest assured that he will have no
   less care of us who live in the present day, when we consider that he
   has vouchsafed to choose us as his temples in which he may dwell by his
   Holy Spirit. Here the prophet, in speaking of Jerusalem, uses merely
   the name of Salem, which was the simple and uncompounded name of the
   city, and had been applied to it very anciently, as appears from
   Genesis 14:18. Some think that the name in the course of time assumed
   its compound form, by having Jebus prefixed to Salem; for Jebus was the
   name by which it was afterwards known in the intervening period, as we
   learn from the Book of Judges, Judges 19:10, it being so called because
   it was inhabited by the Jebusites. But we will be more correct as to
   the etymology of the word, if we derive it from the verb yr'h, yereh,
   which signifies will see, [267] because Abraham said,

   "God will look out for himself a lamb for a burnt-offering," (Genesis
   22:8.)

   3. There he broke the arrows of the bow. We have here stated the
   particular way in which God was known in Judah. He was known by the
   wonderful proofs of his power, which he exhibited in preserving the
   city. Under these figures is described the destruction of the enemies
   of the chosen people. [268] They could not otherwise have been
   overthrown than by being despoiled of their armor and weapons of war.
   It is therefore said, that the arrows, the swords, and the shields,
   were broken, yea, all the implements of war; implying that these
   impious enemies of the Church were deprived of the power of doing harm.
   The fact indeed is, that they were wounded and slain, while their
   weapons remained uninjured; but this metonymy, by which what befell
   themselves is represented as happening to their implements of war, is
   not improper. Some translate the word rsphym, reshaphim, points of
   weapons! Properly, it should be rendered fires; [269] but it is more
   accurate to take it for arrows. Even birds are sometimes metaphorically
   so called, on account of their swiftness; and flying is attributed to
   arrows in Psalm 91:6

   It is farther added, (verse 4th,) that God is more glorious and
   terrible than the mountains of prey By the mountains of prey, is meant
   kingdoms distinguished for their violence and extortion. We know that
   from the beginning, he who exercised himself most in robbery and
   pillage, was the man who most enlarged his borders and became greatest.
   The Psalmist, therefore, here compares those great kings, who had
   acquired large dominions by violence and the shedding of human blood,
   to savage beasts, who live only upon prey, and their kingdoms to
   mountains covered with forests, which are inhabited by beasts inured to
   live by the destruction of other animals. The enemies of God's ancient
   people had been accustomed to make violent and furious assaults upon
   Jerusalem; but it is affirmed that God greatly surpassed them all in
   power that the faithful might not be overwhelmed with terror.

   5. The stout-hearted were spoiled, The power of God in destroying his
   enemies is here exalted by another form of expression. The verb
   'stvllv, eshtolelu, which we translate were spoiled, is derived from
   sll, shalal, and the letter ', aleph, is put instead of the letter h,
   he. [270] Some translate, were made fools; [271] but this is too
   forced. I, however, admit that it is of the same import, as if it had
   been said, that they were deprived of wisdom and courage; but we must
   adhere to the proper signification of the word. What is added in the
   second clause is to the same purpose, All the men of might have not
   found their hands [272] that is to say, they were as incapable of
   fighting as if their hands had been maimed or cut off. In short, their
   strength, of which they boasted, was utterly overthrown. The words,
   they slept their sleep, [273] refer to the same subject; implying that
   whereas before they were active and resolute, their hearts now failed
   them, and they were sunk asleep in sloth and listlessness. The meaning,
   therefore, is, that the enemies of the chosen people were deprived of
   that heroic courage of which they boasted, and which inspired them with
   such audacity; and that, in consequence, neither mind, nor heart, nor
   hands, none either of their mental or bodily faculties, could perform
   their office. We are thus taught that all the gifts and power which men
   seem to possess are in the hand of God, so that he can, at any instant
   of time, deprive them of the wisdom which he has given them, make their
   hearts effeminate, render their hands unfit for war, and annihilate
   their whole strength. It is not without reason that both the courage
   and power of these enemies are magnified; the design of this being,
   that the faithful might be led, from the contrast, to extol the power
   and working of God. The same subject is farther confirmed from the
   statement, that the chariot and the horse were cast into a deep sleep
   at the rebuke of God [274] This implies, that whatever activity
   characterised these enemies, it was rendered powerless, simply by the
   nod of God. Although, therefore, we may be deprived of all created
   means of help, let us rest contented with the favor of God alone,
   accounting it all-sufficient, since he has no need of great armies to
   repel the assaults of the whole world, but is able, by the mere breath
   of his mouth, to subdue and dissipate all assailants.

   [269] "The Hebrew rsph, [here rendered arrows,] signifies fire, Job
   5:7, where sparks that fly upward' are poetically expressed by vny

   to be inflamed. See Cant. 8, 6, where of love it is said, (not the
   coals, but) the arrows thereof are arrows of fire,' it shoots, and
   wounds, and burns a man's heart, inflames it vehemently by wounding it.
   The poetical expression will best be preserved by retaining some trace
   of the primary sense in the rendering of it -- fires or lightnings of
   the bow,' i e., those hostile weapons which are most furious and
   formidable, as fire shot out from a bow." -- Hammond Parkhurst renders
   "glittering flashing arrows," or rather, "fiery, or fire-bearing
   arrows;" such as, it is certain, were used in after times in sieges and
   in battles; the bele pepuromena of the Greeks, to which Paul alludes in
   Ephesians 6:16, and the phalarica of the Romans, which Servius (on
   Virgil, Æn. lib. 9, 5, 705) describes as a dart or javelin with a
   spherical leaden head, to which combustible matter was attached, which
   being set on fire, the weapon was darted against the enemy; and when
   thrown by a powerful hand, it killed those whom it hit, and set fire to
   buildings. Walford has, "fiery arrows." "The arrows," says he, "are
   described as fiery, to denote either the rapidity of their motion, or
   that they were tinged with some poisonous drugs to render them more
   deadly."

   [270] The verb is in the praet. hithpahel; and it has ', aleph, instead
   of h, he, according to the Chaldaic language, which changes h, the
   Hebrew characteristic of hiphil and hithpahel into '

   [271] As the verb signifies, has plundered, spoiled; and as it is here
   in the praet. hithpahel, which generally denotes reciprocal action,
   that is, acting on one's self, it has been here rendered by some,
   despoiled themselves of mind, were mad, furious. Hammond reads, "The
   stout-hearted have despoiled or disarmed themselves." The Chaldee
   paraphrase is, "They have cast away their weapons."

   [272] "ydyhm l' mts'v, may be rendered have not found their hands, i
   e., have not been able to use them for resistance, for the offending
   others, or even for their own defense." -- Hammond The Chaldee
   paraphrase is, "They could not take their weapons in their hands," i
   e., they could not use their hands to manage their weapons. In the
   Septuagint, the reading is, heuron ouden tais chersin auton; "they
   found nothing with their hands," i e., they were able to do nothing
   with them: the vast army of Assyrians, the most warlike and victorious
   then in the world, achieved nothing, but "returned with shame to face
   to their own land," (2 Chronicles 32:21.)

   [273] "They slept their sleep." "They slept, but never waked again." --
   Hammond. There may be here a direct allusion to the catastrophe which
   befell the Assyrian army during the night, when, as they were fast
   asleep in their tents, a hundred and eighty-five thousand of them were
   at once slain, Isaiah 37:36.

   [274] The chariot and horse may be put poetically for charioteers and
   horsemen. Chariots formed a most important part of the array in the
   battles of the ancients. See Judges 4:3. Instead of "both the chariot
   and the horse," Horsley reads, "both the rider and the horse." "It is
   not improbable," says he, "that the pestilence in Sennacherib's army
   might seize the horses as well as the men, although the death of the
   beasts is not mentioned by the sacred historian."

   Psalm 76:7-12

   7. Thou, even thou, art terrible, and who shall stand before thy face
   when thou art angry? 8. From heaven thou hast made thy judgment to be
   heard: the earth was afraid, [275] and was still, 9. When God arose to
   judgment, [276] to save all the meek [277] of the earth. Selah. 10.
   Surely the wrath of men shall praise thee, and the remainder of wrath
   thou wilt restrain. 11. Vow and pay [278] to Jehovah your God: let all
   those who are round about him bring presents to him who is worthy to be
   feared, [279] [literally to the terrible one.] 12. He will cut off the
   spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.


   7. Thou, even thou, art terrible. The repetition of the pronoun Thou,
   is intended to exclude all others from what is here predicated of God,
   as if it had been said, Whatever power there is in the world, it at
   once vanishes away, and is reduced to nothing, when He comes forth and
   manifests himself; and, therefore, He alone is terrible. This is
   confirmed by the comparison added immediately after, which intimates
   that, although the wicked are so filled with pride as to be ready to
   burst with it, yet they are unable to abide the look and presence of
   God. But as he sometimes keeps silence, and seems merely to look on as
   an idle spectator, it is expressly asserted, that as soon as he begins
   to be angry, ruin will be near all the wicked. Although they may then
   for a time not only stand, but also rise above the clouds by their
   fury, we are here, notwithstanding, admonished that we ought to wait
   for the time of wrath. Let us also mark that this terror is denounced
   against the wicked in such a manner as that it sweetly draws all true
   believers to God.

   8. From heaven thou hast made thy judgment to be heard. By the name of
   heaven, the Psalmist forcibly intimates that the judgment of God was
   too manifest to admit of the possibility of its being ascribed either
   to fortune or to the policy of men. Sometimes God executes his
   judgments obscurely, so that they seem to proceed out of the earth. For
   example, when he raises up a godly and courageous prince, the holy and
   lawful administration which will flourish under the reign of such a
   prince will be the judgment of God, but it will not be vividly seen to
   proceed from heaven. As, therefore, the assistance spoken of was of an
   extraordinary kind, it is distinguished by special commendation. The
   same remarks apply to the hearing of God's judgment, of which the
   Psalmist speaks. It is more for the divine judgments to sound aloud
   like a peal of thunder, and to stun the ears of all men with their
   noise, than if they were merely seen with the eyes. There is here, I
   have no doubt, an allusion to those mighty thunder-claps by which men
   are stricken with fear. [280] When it is said, the earth was still, it
   is properly to be referred to the ungodly, who, being panic-struck,
   yield the victory to God, and dare no longer to rage as they had been
   accustomed to do. It is only fear which has the effect of bringing them
   to subjection; and, accordingly, fear is justly represented as the
   cause of this stillness. It is not meant that they restrain themselves
   willingly, but that God compels them whether they will or no. The
   amount is, that whenever God thunders from heaven, the tumults which
   the insolence of the ungodly stir up, when things are in a state of
   confusion, come to an end. We are, at the same time, warned of what men
   may expect to gain by their rebellion; for, whoever despise the
   paternal voice of God which is loudly uttered, must be destroyed by the
   bolts of his wrath.

   9. When God arose to judgment. The great object which God had in view
   in executing this judgment is now declared; which was, that he might
   furnish a proof of his fatherly love towards all his people. He is,
   therefore, introduced as speaking, not with his mouth, but with his
   hand, that he may show to all how precious in his sight is the
   salvation of all who fear and love him. Under the word arise, there is
   a reference to the inactivity and indolency ascribed by wicked men to
   God, an opinion which had led them to take so much liberty to
   themselves. God is then said to ascend into his judgment-seat, when he
   plainly indicates that he exercises a special care over his Church. The
   design of the passage is to show that it is as impossible for God to
   forsake the afflicted and innocent, as it is impossible for him to deny
   himself. It is to be observed that he is termed Judge, because he
   affords succor to the poor who are unrighteously oppressed. The
   appellation of the meek or humble of the earth is applied to the
   faithful, who, subdued by afflictions, seek not high things, but, with
   humble groaning, patiently bear the burden of the cross. The best fruit
   of afflictions is, when thereby we are brought to purge our minds from
   all arrogance, and to bend them to meekness and modesty. When such is
   the effect, we may conclude with certainty that we are under the
   guardianship and protection of God, and that he is ready to extend his
   aid and favor towards us.

   10. Surely the wrath of men shall praise thee. Some understand these
   words as denoting, that after these enemies shall have submitted to
   God, they will yield to him the praise of the victory; being
   constrained to acknowledge that they have been subdued by his mighty
   hand. Others elicit a more refined sense, That when God stirs up the
   wicked, and impels their fury, he in this way affords a most
   illustrious display of his own glory; even as he is said to have
   stirred up the heart of Pharaoh for this very purpose, (Exodus 14:4;
   Romans 9:17.) Understood in this sense, the text no doubt contains a
   profitable doctrine, but this being, I am afraid, too refined an
   explanation, I prefer considering the meaning simply to be, that
   although at first the rage of the enemies of God and his Church may
   throw all things into confusion, and, as it were, envelop them in
   darkness, yet all will at length redound to his praise; for the issue
   will make it manifest, that, whatever they may contrive and attempt,
   they cannot in any degree prevail against him. The concluding part of
   the verse, The remainder of wrath thou wilt restrain, may also be
   interpreted in two ways. As the word chgr, chagar, signifies to gird,
   some supply the pronoun thee, and give this sense, All the enemies of
   the Church are not yet overthrown; but thou, O God! wilt gird thyself
   to destroy those of them who remain. The other interpretation is,
   however, the more simple., which is, that although these enemies might
   not cease to breathe forth their cruelty, yet God would effectually
   restrain them, and prevent them from succeeding in the accomplishment
   of their enterprises. [281] Perhaps, also, it would not be unsuitable
   to explain the verb thus, Thou wilt gather into a bundle, as we say in
   French, "Tu trousseras," i.e., Thou wilt truss or pack up. Let us
   therefore learn, while the wicked would involve in obscurity and doubt
   the providence of God, to wait patiently until he glorify himself by
   bringing about a happier state of things, and trample under foot their
   infatuated presumption, to their shame and confusion. But if new
   troubles arise from time to time, let us remember that it is his proper
   office to restrain the remainder of the wrath of the wicked, that they
   may not proceed to greater lengths. Meanwhile, let us not be surprised
   if we observe fresh outrages every now and then springing forth; for,
   even to the end of the world, Satan will always have partisans or
   agents, whom he will urge forward to molest the children of God.

   11. Vow and pay to Jehovah your God. The faithful are now exhorted to
   the exercise of gratitude. As under the law the custom prevailed among
   the Jews of vowing sacrifices for singular blessings which God had
   conferred upon them, by which they solemnly acknowledged that their
   safety depended solely upon him, and that to him they were entirely
   indebted for it, they are called anew to engage in this exercise of
   religion; and by the word pay it is intended to inculcate
   steadfastness, -- to teach them that they should not make merely a
   sudden and inconsiderate acknowledgement, but that they should also
   testify at all times that the remembrance of their deliverance was
   deeply fixed in their hearts. Their most important business, no doubt,
   was seriously to reflect with themselves that God was the author of
   their salvation; but still it is to be observed, that the solemn
   profession of religion, by which every man stimulates not only himself
   but also others to the performance of their duty, is far from being
   superfluous. In the second clause, those addressed seem to be the
   neighboring nations; as if it had been said, that such a special
   manifestation of the goodness of God was worthy of being celebrated
   even by foreign and uncircumcised nations. [282] But it appears to me,
   that the sense most agreeable to the context is, that these words are
   addressed either to the Levites or to all the posterity of Abraham,
   both of whom are not improperly said to be round about God, both
   because the tabernacle was pitched in the midst of the camp so long as
   the Israelites traveled in the wilderness, and also because the
   resting-place assigned for the ark was mount Zion, whither the people
   were accustomed to resort from all the surrounding parts of the
   country. And the Levites had intrusted to them the charge of the
   temple, and were appointed to keep watch and ward round about it. The
   word lmvr', lammora, is referred to God by the majority of
   interpreters, and they translate it terrible. The term fear is,
   however, sometimes taken in a passive sense for God himself. [283] If
   it is applied to the Gentiles and to irreligious men, [284] the sense
   will be, that they shall be tributaries to God; because, being stricken
   with fear, they shall no longer dare to offer him any resistance. But
   it is more probable that this word has a reference to God, whom the
   prophet justly declares to be worthy of being feared, after having
   given such a remarkable proof of his power.

   12. He will cut off [285] the spirit of princes. As the Hebrew word
   vtsr, batsar, occasionally signifies to strengthen, some think it
   should be so translated in this passage. But as in the two clauses of
   the verse the same sentiment is repeated, I have no doubt that by the
   first clause is meant that understanding and wisdom are taken away from
   princes; and that by the second, God is represented in general as
   terrible to them, because he will cast them down headlong from their
   loftiness. As the first thing necessary to conduct an enterprise to a
   prosperous issue is to possess sound foresight, in which the people of
   God are often deficient from the great perplexity in which they are
   involved in the midst of their distresses, while, on the other hand,
   the ungodly are too sharp-sighted in their crafty schemes; it is here
   declared that it is in the power of God to deprive of understanding,
   and to inflict blindness on those who seem to surpass others in
   acuteness and ingenuity. The majority of princes being enemies to the
   Church of God, it is expressly affirmed, that He is sufficiently
   terrible to subdue all the kings of the earth. When it is said, that
   their spirit is cut off, or taken away from them, it is to be limited
   to tyrants and robbers whom God infatuates, because he sees that they
   apply all their ingenuity and counsels to do mischief.

   [280] When an angel of the Lord descended to perform some mighty work
   with which he had been commissioned, thunders and earthquakes
   frequently accompanied the execution of his commission; and it is
   highly probable that both these phenomena accompanied such a stupendous
   display of power, as that which was afforded by the slaughter of one
   hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the army of Sennacherib. By
   God's judgment being heard, may accordingly be understood the thunder
   which was heard; and what follows, "The earth was afraid," may signify
   the earthquake which then took place.

   [281] Hammond's statement of these two interpretations is clear and
   full. It is as follows: -- "What tchgvr [which Calvin renders, thou
   wilt restrain] signifies here, is not agreed among the interpreters,
   the word signifying 1. to gird, and, 2. to restrain In the notion of
   restraining, it will have a very commodious sense, applied to
   Sennacherib, to whom this psalm belongs. For, as by the slaughter of
   the one hundred and eighty-five thousand in his army he was forced to
   depart, and dwell at Nineveh, 2 Kings 19:36; so, after his return
   thither, there are some remainders of his wrath on the Jews that dwelt
   there. We may see it, Tobit 1:18, If the king Sennacherib had slain
   any, when he was come and fled from Judea, I buried them privily, (for
   in his wrath he killed many,') etc. This was the gleanings of his
   wrath, and this was restrained' by God; for he soon falls by the hands
   of his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, as he was worshipping in the
   house of Nisroch his god,' 2 Kings 19:37. And to this sense Kimchi
   interprets it, Thou shalt so repress the malice of our enemies, that
   the other nations shall not dare to fight against us;' so likewise Aben
   Ezra. And thus it must be, if the remainder of wrath' be man's wrath,'
   as the former part of the verse inclines it, Surely the wrath of man,'
   etc. But chgr, in the primary notion, signifies girding or putting on,
   arraying oneself Girding, we know, signifies putting on, and is applied
   to garments, ornaments, arms: chgvr, Gird thy sword upon thy thigh,'
   Psalm 45:3, and frequently elsewhere; and so girding with gladness,' is
   putting on festival ornaments. And in like manner here, in a poetical
   phrase, Thou shalt gird on the remainder of wrath,' parallel to putting
   on the garments of vengeance for clothing,' Isaiah 59:17, will signify
   God's adorning and setting out himself by the exercise of his
   vengeance, vulgarly expressed by his wrath, and the word chmt, wrath,
   most fitly used with reference on chmt, the wrath of man, in the
   beginning of the verse. Man's wrath is the violence, and rage, and
   blasphemy of the oppressor, upon the meek or poor man foregoing. This
   begins, goes foremost, in provoking God; and then s'ryt, the remnant,
   or second part of wrath, is still behind for God; and with that he
   girds himself, i e., sets himself out illustriously and dreadfully, as
   with an ornament, and as with an hostile preparation in the eyes of
   men. And so in this sense also it is agreeable to the context... In
   either sense, the parts of this verse are perfectly answerable the one
   to the other. To this latter rendering of tchgvr, the Chaldee inclines
   us, paraphrasing it by, Thou hast girded on, or prepared, or made
   ready, the remainder of fury, (meaning by God's fury,) for the
   destroying of the nations.'"

   [282] This is Kimchi's interpretation: He understands by "those round
   about God," the nations near the land of Israel, and so near God.

   [283] In this sense it is employed in Genesis 31:53, "And Jacob sware
   by the Fear of his father Isaac."

   [284] If it is thus applied, the reading will be, "Let all those who
   are round about him bring presents on account of fear."

   [285] The word employed by Calvin is "Vindemiabit," which expresses the
   precise idea of the original verb, yvtsvr, yebtstor It is from vtsr, he
   cut off, brake off, referring properly to grapes and other fruits. The
   reading of the LXX. is, "takes away."

   [264] "Et bien equippez de toutes choses requises a la guerre." -- Fr.

   [265] The inscription prefixed to the psalm in the Septuagint expressly
   mentions this as the occasion of its composition, Ode pros ton
   Assurion; "An ode against the Assyrian." If in this the version of the
   LXX. is correct, and if Asaph, to whom the psalm is ascribed, was the
   person of that name who lived in the time of David, one of his
   compositions must have been adopted as suitably descriptive of this
   remarkable deliverance. He may, however, have been a different person
   of the same name, and was probably one of his descendants, as has been
   before observed, (page 159,) who lived in the time of Hezekiah. Bishop
   Patrick and Calmet are of this last opinion. Those who adopt the former
   suppose that the original reference of the psalm was to the victory
   obtained by David over the Philistines in the valley of Rephaim.

   PSALM 77

   Whoever was the penman of this psalm, the Holy Spirit seems, by his
   mouth, to have dictated a common form of prayer for the Church in her
   afflictions, that even under the most cruel persecutions the faithful
   might not fail to address their prayers to heaven. It is not the
   private grief of some particular individual which is here expressed,
   but the lamentations and groanings of the chosen people. The faithful
   celebrate the deliverance which had been once wrought for them, and
   which was a testimony of God's everlasting grace, to animate and
   strengthen themselves to engage in the exercise of prayer with the
   greater earnestness.

   To the chief musician upon Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.

   Psalm 77:1-6

   1. My voice came to God, and I cried: my voice came to God, and he
   heard me. 2. I sought the: Lord in the day of my trouble: my hand was
   stretched out in the night, and remitted not my soul refused to be
   comforted. 3. I will remember God, and will be troubled: I will
   meditate, and my spirit will be oppressed [or overwhelmed] with sorrow.
   Selah. 4. Thou hast held the watches of my eyes: I am troubled, and
   will not speak. 5. I have recounted the days of old, the years of
   ancient times. 6. I will call to remembrance my song in the night: I
   will commune with my heart, and my spirit will search diligently.


   1. My voice came to God, and I cried. This is not a mere complaint, as
   some interpreters explain it, denoting the surprise which the people of
   God felt in finding that he who hitherto had been accustomed to grant
   their requests shut his ears to them, and was called upon in vain. It
   appears more probable that the prophet either speaks of the present
   feeling of his mind, or else calls to remembrance how he had
   experienced that God was inclined and ready to hear his prayers. There
   can be no doubt that he describes the greatness of the sorrow with
   which he was afflicted; and, in nay opinion, he denotes a continued act
   both by the past and the future tenses of the verbs. In the first
   place, he declares that he did not foolishly rend the air with his
   cries, like many who pour forth bitter cries without measure and at
   random under their sorrows; but that he addressed his speech to God
   when necessity constrained him to cry. The copula and, which is joined
   to the verb cried, should be resolved into the adverb of time when, in
   this way, When I cried my voice came to God At the same time, he also
   shows, that although he had been constrained often to reiterate his
   cries, he had not given over persevering in prayer. What is added
   immediately after is intended for the confirmation of his faith: And he
   heard me. The copula and, as in many other places, is here put instead
   of the causal adverb for. The meaning is, that he encouraged himself to
   cry to God, from the consideration that it was God's usual manner to
   show his favor and mercy towards him.

   2. I sought the Lord in the day of my trouble. In this verse he
   expresses more distinctly the grievous and hard oppression to which the
   Church was at that time subjected. There is, however, some ambiguity in
   the words. The Hebrew word yd, yad, which I have translated hand, is
   sometimes taken metaphorically for a wound; and, therefore, many
   interpreters elicit this sense, My wound ran in the night, and ceased
   not, [286] that is to say, My wound was not so purified from ulcerous
   matter as that the running from it was made to stop. But; I rather take
   the word in its ordinary signification, which is hand, because the verb
   ngrh, niggera, which he uses, signifies not only to run as a sore does,
   but also to be stretched forth or extended. [287] Now, when he affirms
   that he sought the Lord in the day of his trouble, and that his hands
   were stretched out to him in the night season, this denotes that prayer
   was his continual exercise, -- that his heart was so earnestly and
   unweariedly engaged in that exercise, that he could not desist from it.
   In the concluding sentence of the verse the adversative particle
   although is to be supplied; and thus the meaning will be, that although
   the prophet found no solace and no alleviation of the bitterness of his
   grief, he still continued to stretch forth his hands to God. In this
   manner it becomes us to wrestle against despair, in order that our
   sorrow, although it may seem to be incurable, may not shut our mouths,
   and keep us from pouring out our prayers before God.

   3. I will remember God, and will be troubled. The Psalmist here employs
   a variety of expressions to set forth the vehemence of his grief, and,
   at the same time, the greatness of his affliction. He complains that
   what constituted the only remedy for allaying his sorrow became to him
   a source of disquietude. It may, indeed, seem strange that the minds of
   true believers should be troubled by remembering God. But the meaning
   of the inspired writer simply is, that although he thought upon God his
   distress of mind was not removed. It no doubt often happens that the
   remembrance of God in the time of adversity aggravates the anguish and
   trouble of the godly, as, for example, when they entertain the thought
   that he is angry with them. The prophet, however, does not mean that
   his heart was thrown into new distress and disquietude whenever God was
   brought to his recollection: he only laments that no consolation
   proceeded from God to afford him relief; and this is a trial which it
   is very hard to bear. It is not surprising to see the wicked racked
   with dreadful mental agony; for, since their great object and endeavor
   is to depart from God, they must suffer the punishment which they
   deserve, on account of their rebellion against him. But when the
   remembrance of God, from which we seek to draw consolation for
   mitigating our calamities, does not afford repose or tranquillity to
   our minds, we are ready to think that he is sporting with us. We are
   nevertheless taught from this passage, that however much we may
   experience of fretting, sorrow, and disquietude, we must persevere in
   calling upon God even in the midst of all these impediments.

   4. Thou hast held the watches of my eyes. [288] This verse is to the
   same effect with the preceding. The Psalmist affirms that he spent
   whole nights in watching, because God granted him no relief. The night
   in ancient times was usually divided into many watches; and,
   accordingly, he describes his continued grief, which pre. vented him
   from sleeping, by the metaphorical term watches. When he stated a
   little before that he prayed to God with a loud voice, and when he now
   affirms that he will remain silent, there seems to be some appearance
   of discrepancy. This difficulty has already been solved in our
   exposition of Psalm 32:3, where we have shown that true believers, when
   overwhelmed with sorrow, do not continue in a state of unvarying
   uniformity, but sometimes give vent to sighs and complaints, while, at
   other times, they are silent as if their mouths were stopped. It is,
   therefore, not wonderful to find the prophet frankly confessing that he
   was so overwhelmed, and, as it were, choked, with calamities, as to be
   unable to open his mouth to utter even a single word.

   5. I have recounted the days of old. There is no doubt that he
   endeavored to assuage his grief by the remembrance of his former joy;
   but he informs us that relief was not so easily nor so speedily
   obtained. By the days of old, and the years of ancient times, he seems
   not only to refer to the brief course of his own life, but to
   comprehend many ages. The people of God, in their afflictions, ought,
   undoubtedly, to set before their eyes, and to call to their
   remembrance, not only the Divine blessings which they have individually
   experienced, but also all the blessings which God in every age has
   bestowed upon his Church It may, however, be easily gathered from the
   text, that when the prophet reckoned up in his own mind the mercies
   which God had bestowed in time past, he began with his own experience.

   6. I will call to remembrance my song in the night. By his song he
   denotes the exercise of thanksgiving in which he had engaged during the
   time of his prosperity. [289] There is no remedy better adapted for
   healing our sorrows, as I have just now observed, than this; but Satan
   often craftily suggests to our thoughts the benefits of God, that the
   very feeling of the want of them may inflict upon our minds a deeper
   wound. It is, therefore, highly probable, that the prophet was pierced
   with bitter pangs when he compared the joy experienced by him in time
   past with the calamities which he was presently suffering. He expressly
   mentions the night; because, when we are then alone by ourselves, and
   withdrawn from the society and presence of men, it engenders in the
   mind more cares and thoughts than are experienced during the day. What
   is added immediately after with respect to communing with his own
   heart, is to the same effect. Solitude has an influence in leading men
   to retire within their own minds, to examine themselves thoroughly, and
   to speak to themselves freely and in good earnest, when no created
   being is with them to impose a restraint by his presence.

   The last clause of the verse, And my spirit will search diligently,
   admits of a twofold exposition. The word chphs, chaphas, for search
   diligently, [290] being in the masculine gender, and the word rvh,
   ruach, for spirit, being sometimes feminine, some commentators suppose
   that the name of God is to be understood, and explain the sentence as
   if the Psalmist had said, There is nothing, O Lord! so hidden in my
   heart into which thou hast not penetrated. And God is with the highest
   propriety said to search the spirit of the man whom he awakens from his
   indolence or torpor, and whom he examines by acute afflictions. Then
   all hiding -- places and retreats, however obscure, are explored, and
   affections before unknown are brought into the light. As, however, the
   gender of the noun in the Hebrew language is ambiguous, others more
   freely translate, MY spirit hath searched diligently. This being the
   sense which is most generally embraced, and being, at the same time,
   the most natural, I readily adopt it. In that debate, of which the
   inspired writer makes mention, he searched for the causes on account of
   which he was so severely afflicted, and also into what. his calamities
   would ultimately issue. It is surely highly profitable to meditate on
   these subjects, and it is the design of God to stir us up to do this
   when any adversity presses upon us. There is nothing more perverse than
   the stupidity [291] of those who harden themselves under the scourges
   of God. Only we must keep within due bounds, in order that we may not
   be swallowed up of over much sorrow, and that the unfathomable depth of
   the Divine judgments may not overwhelm us by our attempting to search
   them out thoroughly. The prophet's meaning is, that when he sought for
   comfort in all directions, he could find none to assuage the bitterness
   of his grief.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [286] This is the rendering in our English Bible, which Dr Adam Clarke
   pronounces to be "a most unaccountable translation." The reading of the
   margin, however, "my hand," favours the sense given by our Author.

   [287] This is the translation adopted by many critics, and it appears
   to be the true signification of the passage. Thus Symmachus' version
   is, he cheir mou nuktosektetato dienekos, "my hand was stretched out by
   night continually;" and, in like manner, Jerome, "Manus mea nocte
   extenditur, et non quiescit." Parkhurst renders the verse thus: "In the
   day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my hand was stretched out by night
   and ceased not," or, "without interruption." With this agree the
   versions of Horsley, Mant, Fry, Adam Clarke, Walford, and others. The
   stretching out of the hand was an usual gesture in prayer. Instead of
   ydy, the Chaldee reads yny, "mine eye trickled down," which Archbishop
   Secker and Green think likely to be the true reading.

   [288] Some of the Jewish commentators interpret this clause thus: "Thou
   holdest the brows of my eyes." The eyebrows which protect the eyes were
   held, so that he could not shut them and obtain sleep. Sleep to a
   person in trouble has the effect of interrupting his sorrow for a time,
   and of weakening it by refreshing the body. It is, therefore, in such
   circumstances, a great blessing, and is earnestly desired. But to have
   this denied, and for the sufferer to have sleepless and wearisome
   nights appointed to him, is a great aggravation of his distress.

   [289] "The times were indeed greatly altered; formerly his sleep had
   been prevented by the joyfulness of his feelings, which prompted the
   voice of thanksgiving during even the shades of night; now his sleep is
   taken away by the severity of his disease, and the anguish of his soul,
   which was augmented by the contrast with his past happiness." --
   Walford.

   [290] "The verb chphs, chaphas, signifies such an investigation as a
   man makes who is obliged to strip himself in order to do it. Or, to
   lift up coverings, to search fold by fold; or, in our phrase, to leave
   no stone unturned The Vulgate translates, et scopebam spiritum meum As
   scopebam is no pure Latin word, it may probably be taken from the
   Greek, skopeo, scopeo, to look about, to consider attentively.' It is,
   however, used by no author but St Jerome, and by him only here, and in
   Isaiah 14:23, And I will sweep it with the besom of destruction;'
   scopabo eam in scopa terens.' Hence we see that he has formed a verb
   from the noun scopae; a sweeping brush or besom." -- Dr Adam Clarke

   [291] "La stupidite brutale." -- Fr. "The brutish stupidity."

   Psalm 77:7-10

   7. Will the Lord cast off [292] for ever? and will he be favorable no
   more? 8. Is his mercy quite gone for ever? Doth his oracle fail from
   generation to generation? 9. Hath God forgotten, to be merciful? Hath
   he shut up his compassions in anger? Selah. 10. And said, My death,
   [293] the years [294] of the right hand of the Most High.


   7. and 8. Will the Lord cast off for ever? The statements here made
   undoubtedly form a part of the searchings which engaged the Psalmist's
   mind. He intimates that he was almost overwhelmed by a long succession
   of calamities; for he did not break forth into this language until he
   had endured affliction for so long a period as hardly to venture to
   entertain the hope that God would in future be favorable to him. He
   might well argue with himself whether God would continue to be
   gracious; for when God embraces us with his favor, it is on the
   principle that he will continue to extend it towards us even to the
   end. He does not properly complain or find fault with God, but rather
   reasoning with himself, concludes, from the nature of God, that it is
   impossible for him not to continue his free favor towards his people,
   to whom he has once shown himself to be a father. As he has traced all
   the blessings which the faithful receive from the Divine hand to the
   mere good pleasure of God, as to a fountain; so a little after he adds
   the Divine goodness, as if he had said, How can we suppose it possible
   for God to break off the course of his fatherly layout, when it is
   considered that he cannot divest himself of his own nature? We see,
   then, how by an argument drawn from the goodness of God, he repels the
   assaults of temptation. When he puts the question, Doth his word or
   oracle fail? he intimates that he was destitute of all consolation,
   since he met with no promise to support and strengthen his faith. We
   are indeed thrown into a gulf of despair when God takes away from us
   his promises in which our happiness and salvation are included. If it
   is objected, that such as had the ]Law among their hands could not be
   without the word of God, I answer, that on account of the imperfection
   of the former dispensation, when Christ was not yet manifested, [295]
   special promises were then necessary. Accordingly, in Psalm 74:9, we
   find the faithful complaining that they saw not any longer their wonted
   signs, and that there was no longer a prophet who had knowledge of the
   time among them. If David was the penman of this psalm, we know that in
   matters of doubt and perplexity it was usual with him to ask counsel
   from God, and that God was accustomed to grant him answers. If he was
   deprived of this source of alleviation in the midst of his calamities,
   he had reason to bewail that he found no oracle or word to sustain and
   strengthen his faith. But if the psalm was composed by some other
   inspired prophet, this complaint will suit the period which intervened
   between the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity and the
   coming of Christ; for, during that time, the course of prophecy was in
   a manner broken off, and there was none endued with any peculiar gift
   of the Holy Spirit to raise up the hearts of those who were cast down,
   or to support and keep them from falling. In addition to this, it
   sometimes happens that although the word of God is offered to us, it
   yet does not enter into our minds, in consequence of our being involved
   in such deep distress, as to prevent us from receiving or admitting the
   smallest degree of comfort. But I embrace the former sense, which is,
   that the Church was now without those special announcements of prophecy
   with which she had formerly been favored, and that as she still
   depended upon the mere sight of the shadows of that economy, she stood
   constantly in need of fresh supports. From this we may gather the
   profitable lesson, that we ought not to be unduly disquieted, if God
   should at any time withdraw his word from us. It should be borne in
   mind, that he tries his own people by such wonderful methods, that they
   imagine the whole of Scripture to be turned from its proper end, and
   that although they are desirous to hear God speaking, they yet cannot
   be brought to apply his words to their own particular case. This, as I
   have said, is a distressing and painful thing; but it ought not to
   hinder us from engaging in the exercise of prayer.

   9. Hath God forgotten to be merciful? The prophet still continues
   debating with himself the same subject. His object, however, is not to
   overthrow his faith, but rather to raise it up. He does not put this
   question, as if the point to which it refers were a doubtful matter. It
   is as if he had said, Hath God forgotten himself? or, hath he changed
   his nature? for he cannot be God unless he is merciful. I indeed admit
   that he did not remain unshaken as if he had had a heart of steel. But
   the more violently he was assailed, the more firmly did he lean upon
   the truth, That the goodness of God is so inseparably connected with
   his essence as to render it impossible for him not to be merciful.
   Whenever, therefore, doubts enter into our minds upon our being
   harassed with cares, and oppressed with sorrows, let us learn always to
   endeavor to arrive at a satisfactory answer to this question, Has God
   changed his nature so as to be no longer merciful? The last clause,
   Hath he shut up or restrained his compassions in his anger? is to the
   same effect. It was a very common and notable observation among the
   holy patriarchs, That God is long -- suffering, slow to wrath, ready to
   forgive, and easy to be entreated. It was from them that Habakkuk
   derived the statement which he makes in his song,

   "Even in his anger he will be mindful of his mercy." (Habakkuk 3:2)

   The prophet, then, here comes to the conclusion, that the chastisement
   which he felt would not prevent God from being again reconciled to him,
   and returning to his wonted manner of bestowing blessings upon him,
   since his anger towards his own people endures only for a moment. Yea,
   although God manifests the tokens of his anger, he does not cease most
   tenderly to love those whom he chastises. His wrath, it its true, rests
   continually upon the reprobate; but the prophet, accounting himself
   among the number of God's children, and speaking of other genuine
   believers, justly argues from the impossibility of the thing, that the
   temporary displeasure of God cannot break off the course of his
   goodness and mercy.

   10. And I said, My death, the years of the right hand, etc. This
   passage has been explained in various ways. Some deriving the word
   chlvty, challothi, from chlh, chalah, which signifies to kill, consider
   the prophet as meaning, that being overwhelmed with an accumulation of
   calamities, the only conclusion to which he could come was, that God
   had appointed him to utter destruction; and that his language is a
   confession of his having fallen into despair. Others translate it to be
   sick, to be infirm or enfeebled, which is much more agreeable to the
   scope of the passage. [296] But they differ with respect to the
   meaning. According to some interpreters, the prophet accuses and
   reproves himself for his effeminacy of mind, and for not setting
   himself more manfully to resist temptation. [297] This exposition may
   be admitted; for the people of God ordinarily gather courage after
   having for a time wavered under the shock of temptation. I, however,
   prefer a different interpretation, namely, that this was a disease
   merely temporary, and on this account, he compares it indirectly to
   death; even as it is said in Psalm 118:18,

   "The Lord hath chastised me sore: but he hath not given me over unto
   death." Also, "I shall not die, but live." (Psalm 118:18)

   He, therefore, I have no doubt, unburdens himself by cherishing the
   confident persuasion, that although he was at present cast down, it was
   only for a season, and that therefore it behoved him patiently to
   endure this sickness or disease, since it was not mortal. Nor are
   commentators agreed in the explanation of the second clause. Those who
   connect this verse with the preceding verses, think that the prophet
   was reduced to such a state of despondency at first, that he looked
   upon himself as utterly undone; and that afterwards he lifted up his
   head at times, even as those who are thrown into the deep in a
   shipwreck repeatedly rise above the water. Besides, they would have
   this to be understood as a word of encouragement addressed by some one
   to the prophet, desiring him to call to remembrance the years in which
   he had experienced that God was merciful to him. But it will be more
   appropriate to understand it thus:, Thou hast no reason to think that
   thou art now doomed to death, since thou art not laboring under an
   incurable disease, and the hand of God is wont to make whole those whom
   it has stricken. I do not reject the opinion of those who translate
   snvt, shenoth, by changes; [298] for as the Hebrew verb snh, shanah,
   signifies to change, or to do a thing again and again, the Hebrews have
   taken from it the word snvt, shenoth, which they employ to denote
   years, from their revolving character, from their turning round, as it
   were, in the same orbit. But in whatever way we may understand it, the
   comfort of which I have spoken will remain firm, which is, that the
   prophet, assuring himself of a favorable change in his condition, does
   not look upon himself as doomed to death. Others give a somewhat
   different interpretation, arriving at it in another way: [299] as if
   the prophet had said, Why shouldst thou not patiently endure the
   severity of God at this time, when hitherto he has cherished thee by
   his beneficence? even as Job said,

   "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not
   also receive evil?" (Job 2:10)

   But it is more probable that the prophet directs his view to the
   future, and means that it became him to await the years or revolutions
   of the right hand of the Most High, until lie should afford clear and
   undisputed evidence of the return of his favor towards him.

   [296] Walford translates, "Then I said, My disease is this. "Such," he
   observes, "is the exact rendering of the text. Some painful disease had
   befallen him, which was heightened by the depression of his spirits,
   which deprived him of mental vigor and energy, and clothed every object
   in the blackest colours. ... I said, This is my disease.' My mind is
   oppressed by the mortified feelings of my corporeal frame, and on this
   account, the changes by which the hand of God has affected me appear in
   the darkest colours, and I am ready to give up every hope that he will
   ever display his goodness to me as he formerly did."

   [297] According to this view, he refers to what he had said in the 7th,
   8th, and 9th verses, in which he seemed to arrive at the conclusion,
   that there would never be an end to his present afflictions, as if the
   decree had gone forth, and God had pronounced a final and irreversible
   sentence. But here he checks and corrects himself for having given
   utterance to such language, and recalls his thoughts to more just and
   encouraging sentiments respecting God. He acknowledges his sin in
   questioning or yielding to a feeling of suspicion in reference to the
   divine love, and the truth of the divine promises; and confesses that
   this flowed from the corruption of his nature, and the weakness of his
   faith; that he had spoken rashly and in haste; and that taking shame
   and confusion of face to himself, he would now desist and proceed no
   farther.

   [298] Walford translates the verse thus: -- "Then I said, My disease is
   this,
   The change of the right hand of the High God." "There is no authority,"
   he observes, "for the version, I will remember the years;' his meaning
   is, the power of God has changed and altered my condition; from a state
   of health and peace, he has brought me into disease, and pain, and
   sorrow. This, he says, he will remember, so as to inspire some hope
   that the power which had brought low would again raise him up."

   [299] Our Author seems to refer to those interpreters who, as in our
   English version, make the supplement, But I will remember, before the
   words, "the years of the right hand of the Most High."

   Psalm 77:11-14

   11. I will remember the works of God: surely I will remember thy
   wonderful works from the beginning. 12. I will also meditate on all thy
   works, and I will muse on thy doings. 13. Thy ways, O God! are in the
   sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? 14. Thou art the God that
   doest wonders: thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.


   11. I will remember the works of God. The prophet now, inspired with
   new courage, vigorously resists the temptations, which had so far
   prevailed against him as well nigh to overwhelm his faith. This
   remembering of the works of God differs from the remembering of which
   he had previously spoken. Then he contemplated from a distance the
   divine benefits, and he found the contemplation of them inadequate to
   assuage or mitigate his grief. Here he takes hold of them, so to speak,
   as assured testimonies of God's everlasting grace. To express the
   greater earnestness, he repeats the same sentence, interjecting an
   affirmation; for the word ky, ki, is here used simply to confirm or
   enhance the statement. Having then, as it were, obtained the victory,
   he triumphs in the remembrance of the works of God, being assuredly
   persuaded that God would continue the same as he had shown himself to
   be from the beginning. In the second clause, he highly extols the power
   which God had displayed in preserving his servants: I will remember thy
   wonderful works from the beginning. He employs the singular number, thy
   secret, or thy wonderful work; but I have not hesitated to correct the
   obscurity by changing the number. We will find him soon after employing
   the singular number to denote many miracles. What he means in short is,
   that the wonderful power of God which he has always put forth for the
   preservation and salvation of his servants, provided we duly reflect
   upon it, is sufficient to enable us to overcome all sorrows. Let us
   learn from this, that, although sometimes the remembrance of the works
   of God may bring us less comfort than we would desire, and our
   circumstances would require, we must nevertheless strive, that the
   weariness produced by grief may not break our courage. This is
   deserving of our most careful attention. In the time of sorrow, we are
   always desirous of finding some remedy to mitigate its bitterness; but
   the only way by which this can be done is, to cast our cares upon God.
   It, however, often happens, that the nearer he approaches us, the more,
   to outward appearance, does he aggravate our sorrows. Many, therefore,
   when they derive no advantage from this course, imagine that they
   cannot do better than forget him. Thus they loathe his word, by the
   hearing of which their sorrow is rather embittered than mitigated, and
   what is worse, they desire that God, who thus aggravates and inflames
   their grief, would withdraw to a distance. Others, to bury the
   remembrance of him, devote themselves wholly to worldly business. It
   was far otherwise with the prophet. Although he did not immediately
   experience the benefit which he could have desired, yet he still
   continued to set God. before his view, wisely supporting his faith by
   the reflection, that as God changes neither his love nor his nature, he
   cannot but show himself at length merciful to his servants. Let us also
   learn to open our eyes to behold the works of God; the excellence of
   which is of little account in our estimation, by reason of the dimness
   of our eyes, and our inadequate perception of them; but which, if
   examined attentively, will ravish us with admiration. The Psalmist
   repeats in the 12th verse, that he will meditate continually upon these
   works, until, in due time, he receive the full advantage which this
   meditation is calculated to afford. The reason why so many examples of
   the grace of God contribute nothing to our profit, and fail in edifying
   our faith, is, that as soon as we have begun to make them the subjects
   of our consideration, our inconstancy draws us away to something else,
   and thus, at the very commencement, our minds soon lose sight of them.

   13. Thy ways, O God! are in the sanctuary. Some translate in holiness,
   and they are led to do this, because it seems to them a cold and meagre
   form of expression to say, that God's ways are in his sanctuary But as
   the rules of grammar will not easily admit of this, we must inquire
   whether a profitable truth may not be drawn from the term sanctuary,
   which is the proper signification of the original word vqds, bakkodesh.
   Some are of opinion that this is an abrupt exclamation, as if it had
   been said, O God, who art in the sanctuary! O thy ways! but of this I
   do not approve; for they do violence to the words of the prophet. The
   clause should be read in one connected sentence, and the word sanctuary
   is to be taken either for heaven or for the temple. I am rather
   inclined to refer it to heaven, conceiving the meaning to be, that the
   ways of God rise high above the world, so that if we are truly desirous
   to know them, we must ascend above all heavens. Although the works of
   God are in part manifest to us, yet all our knowledge of them comes far
   short of their immeasurable height. Besides, it is to be observed, that
   none enjoy the least taste of his works but those who by faith rise up
   to heaven. And yet, the utmost point to which we can ever attain is, to
   contemplate with admiration and reverence the hidden wisdom and power
   of God, which, while they shine forth in his works, yet far surpass the
   limited powers of our understanding. If it is objected, that it is
   wrong to attempt to confine to heaven the ways of God, which are
   extended through the whole world, the answer is easy; for although
   there is not a single corner of the globe in which God does not exhibit
   some proof of his power and operation, yet the wonderful character of
   his works escapes the eyes of men. If any would rather understand
   sanctuary as meaning the temple, it may be noticed, that we have met
   with an almost similar sentence in Psalm 73:16, 17,

   "When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me,
   until I went into the sanctuary of God."

   The temple, indeed, in which God manifested himself was, as it were, a
   heaven on earth. [300] It is now obvious that the meaning of the
   inspired writer is, that as at the commencement he had uttered
   distressing complaints, so now, having attained to a calm and settled
   state of mind, he admires and adores the high ways of God, and
   conscious of his own weakness, quietly and modestly keeps himself
   within the bounds prescribed to him, not permitting himself to judge or
   pass sentence upon the secret judgments of God according to the
   dictates of his carnal understanding. He therefore immediately after
   exclaims, Who is so great a God as our God? By this comparison, he does
   not mean that there are many gods, but he indirectly rebukes the deep
   infatuation of the world who, not contented with the only true God
   whose glory is so conspicuous, invent for themselves many gods. If men
   would look upon the works of God with pure eyes, they would be led
   without much difficulty to rest with satisfaction in him alone.

   14. Thou art the God that doest wonders. The Psalmist confirms the
   preceding sentence, proving the greatness of God from the wonderful
   character of his works. He does not speak of the hidden and mysterious
   essence of God which fills heaven and earth, but of the manifestations
   of his power, wisdom, goodness, and righteousness, which are clearly
   exhibited, although they are too vast for our limited understandings to
   comprehend. Literally, the words are, Thou art the God that doest a
   Wonder; but the singular number is here evidently put for the plural,
   an instance of which we have seen before. From this we learn that the
   glory of God is so near us, and that he has so openly and clearly
   unfolded himself, that we cannot justly pretend any excuse for
   ignorance. He, indeed, works so wonderfully, that even the heathen
   nations are inexcusable for their blindness. For this reason it is
   added, Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. This has an
   immediate reference to the deliverance of the Church; but, at the same
   time, it shows that the glory of God, which he had clearly and mightily
   displayed among the nations, could not be despised without the guilt of
   grievous impiety having been incurred.

   Psalm 77:15-20

   15. Thou hast redeemed thy people by thy arm, the sons of Jacob and
   Joseph. Selah. 16. The waters saw thee, O God! the waters saw thee;
   they were afraid, yea even the deeps trembled. 17. The clouds poured
   out waters, the heavens [or skies] sent forth a sound: thy arrows also
   went abroad. 18. The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven; the
   lightnings illumined the world: the earth trembled and shook. 19. Thy
   ways are in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy
   footsteps are not known. 20. Thou didst lead thy people like a flock by
   the hand of Moses and Aaron.


   15. Thou hast redeemed thy people by thy arm. The Psalmist here
   celebrates, above all the other wonderful works of God, the redemption
   of the chosen people, to which the Holy Spirit everywhere throughout
   the Scriptures invites the attention of true believers, in order to
   encourage them to cherish the hope of their salvation. It is well known
   that the power of God was at that time manifested to the Gentiles. The
   truth of history, indeed, through the artifice of Satan, was corrupted
   and falsified by many fables; but this is to be imputed to the
   wickedness of those in whose sight those wonderful works were wrought,
   who, although they saw them, chose rather to blind their eyes and
   disguise the truth of their existence, than to preserve the true
   knowledge of them. [301] How can we explain the fact that they made
   Moses to be I know not what kind of a magician or enchanter, and
   invented so many strange and monstrous stories, which Josephus has
   collected together in his work against Apion, but upon the principle
   that it was their deliberate purpose to bury in forgetfulness the power
   of God? It is not, however, so much the design of the prophet to
   condemn the Gentiles of the sin of ingratitude, as to furnish himself
   and others of the children of God matter of hope as to their own
   circumstances; for at the time referred to, God openly exhibited for
   the benefit of all future ages a proof of his love towards his chosen
   people. The word arm is here put metaphorically for power of an
   extraordinary character, and which is worthy of remembrance. God did
   not deliver his ancient people secretly and in an ordinary way, but
   openly, and, as it were, with his arm stretched forth. The prophet, by
   calling the chosen tribes the sons of Jacob and Joseph, assigns the
   reason why God accounted them as his people. The reason is, because of
   the covenant into which he entered with their godly ancestors. The two
   tribes which descended from the two sons of Joseph derived their origin
   from Jacob as well as the rest; but the name of Joseph is expressed to
   put honor upon him, by whose instrumentality the whole race of Abraham
   were preserved in safety. [302]

   16. The waters saw thee, O God! Some of the miracles in which God had
   displayed the power of his arm are here briefly adverted to. When it is
   said that the waters saw God, the language is figurative, implying that
   they were moved, as it were, by a secret instinct and impulse to obey
   the divine command in opening up a passage for the chosen people.
   Neither the sea nor the Jordan would have altered their nature, and by
   giving place have spontaneously afforded a passage to them, had they
   not both felt upon them the power of God. [303] It is not meant that
   they retired backward because of any judgment and understanding which
   they possessed, but that in receding as they did, God showed that even
   the inanimate elements are ready to yield obedience to him. There is
   here an indirect contrast, it being intended to rebuke the stupidity of
   men if they do not acknowledge in the redemption of the Israelites from
   Egypt the presence and hand of God, which were seen even by the waters.
   What is added concerning the deeps intimates, that not only the surface
   of the waters were agitated at the sight of God, but that his power
   penetrated even to the deepest gulfs.

   17. The clouds poured out waters. As the noun mym, mayim, cannot be
   taken in the construct state, the verb, I have no doubt, is put
   transitively; but it makes little difference as to the sense, whether
   we take this view, or read as if mym, mayim, were in the construct
   state and the verb passive; that is, whether we read, The clouds poured
   out waters, or, The waters of the clouds were poured out. The meaning
   obviously is, that not only the sea and the river Jordan, but also the
   waters which were suspended in the clouds, yielded to God the honor to
   which he is entitled, the air, by the concussion of the thunder, having
   poured forth copious showers. The object is to show, that, to whatever
   quarter men turn their eyes, the glory of God is illustriously
   manifested, that it is so in every part of creation, above and beneath,
   from the height of heaven to the depths of the sea. What history is
   here referred to is involved in some degree of uncertainty. [304]
   Perhaps it is that which is recorded in Exodus 9:23; where we are
   informed, that hail mingled with thunder and lightning was one of the
   dreadful plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians. The arrows which went
   abroad are, no doubt, to be taken metaphorically for lightnings. With
   this verse we are to connect the following, in which it is said, that
   the voice of the thunder was heard in the air, and that the lightnings
   illumined the world, so that the earth trembled The amount is, that at
   the departure of the people from Egypt, ample testimony was borne to
   the power of God, both to the eyes and the ears of men; peals of
   thunder having been heard in every quarter of the heavens, and the
   whole sky having shone with flashes of lightning, while at the same
   time the earth was made to tremble.

   19. Thy ways are in the sea. The miracle which was wrought in drying up
   the Red Sea is here again described in different phraseology. What,
   properly speaking, refers to the Israelites is applied to God, under
   whose protection and guidance they passed dry-shod through the midst of
   the Red Sea. It is declared that a path had been opened up for them in
   a very strange and unusual manner; for the sea was not drained by the
   skill of man, nor was the river Jordan turned aside from its ordinary
   course into a different channel, but the people walked through the
   midst of the waters in which Pharaoh and his whole army were soon after
   drowned. On this account, it is said, that the footsteps of God were
   not known, for no sooner had God made the people to pass over than he
   caused the waters to return to their accustomed course. [305]

   The purpose for which this was effected is added in the 20th verse, --
   the deliverance of the Church: Thou didst lead thy people like a flock.
   [306] And this deliverance should be regarded by all the godly as
   affording them the best encouragement to cherish the hope of safety and
   salvation. The comparison of the people to sheep, tacitly intimates
   that they were in themselves entirely destitute of wisdom, power, and
   courage, and that God, in his great goodness, condescended to perform
   the office of a shepherd in leading through the sea, and the
   wilderness, and all other impediments, his poor flock, which were
   destitute of all things, that he might put them in possession of the
   promised inheritance. This statement is confirmed, when we are told
   that Moses and Aaron were the persons employed in conducting the
   people. Their service was no doubt illustrious and worthy of being
   remembered; but God displayed in no small degree the greatness of his
   power in opposing two obscure and despised individuals to the fury and
   to the great and powerful army of one of the proudest kings who ever
   sat on a throne. What could the rod of an outlaw and a fugitive, and
   the voice of a poor slave, have done of themselves, against a
   formidable tyrant and a warlike nation? The power of God then was the
   more manifest when it wrought in such earthen vessels. At the same
   time, I do not deny that it is here intended to commend these servants
   of God, to whom he had committed such an honorable trust.

   [301] "Neantmoins il faut imputer cela a la malice de ceux qui ayans
   veu la chose eux-mesmes de leurs yeux, ont mieux aime s'esblouir la
   veue et desguiser le faict, que d'en entretenir la pure cognoissance."

   [302] "The reason of Joseph's being coupled with Jacob is, that as the
   Israelites derived their birth from Jacob, so they were sustained by
   Joseph in Egypt, who became to them a second parent." -- Walford.

   [303] "The waters of the Red Sea,' says Bishop Horne, are here
   beautifully represented as endued with sensibility; as seeing, feeling,
   and being confounded, even to the lowest depths, at the presence and
   power of their great Creator, when he commanded them to open a way, and
   to form a wall on each side of it, until his people were passed over.'
   This, in fact, is true poetry; and in this attributing of life, spirit,
   feeling, action, and suffering, to inanimate objects, there are no
   poets who can vie with those of the Hebrew nation." -- Mant.

   [304] As in the three preceding verses the deliverance of the chosen
   people from Egypt, and the drying up of the Red Sea, to make a way for
   them to pass through, are the subjects celebrated, it is very natural
   to suppose that the 17th and 18th verses refer to the tempestuous rain,
   the thunder, lightning, and earthquake, by which God testified his
   wrath against the Egyptians, and by which that ruthless host were
   filled with dismay, when they went into the midst of the Red Sea after
   the Israelites. Of these particular circumstances, we have indeed no
   distinct information in the narrative of Moses; but from a comparison
   of what is here stated, with what is said in Exodus 14:24, "And it came
   to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the
   Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the
   host of the Egyptians," it seems highly probable that they took place
   on that occasion. With this corresponds the representation given by
   Josephus of this part of Jewish History. "As soon as ever the whole
   Egyptian army was within it, the sea flowed to its own place, and came
   down with a torrent raised by storms of wind, and encompassed the
   Egyptians. Showers of rain also came down from the sky, and dreadful
   thunders and lightning, with flashes of fire. Thunder-bolts also were
   darted upon them; nor was there any thing which used to be sent by God
   upon men, as indications of his wrath, which did not happen at that
   time; for a dark and dismal night oppressed them." -- Antiquities of
   the Jews, Book II. chapter 16, section 3.

   [305] "Thy footsteps are not known; not by the Egyptians, who essayed
   to follow after the people of Israel, with the Lord at the head of
   them, nor by any since; for the waters returned and covered the place
   on which the Israelites went as on dry ground; so that no footsteps or
   traces were to be seen at all ever since; and such are the ways of God,
   many of them in providence as well as in grace, Romans 11:33." -- Dr
   Gill.

   [306] "After the sublime and awful imagery of the four preceding
   verses, in which thunders and lightnings, storms and tempests, rain,
   hail, and earthquakes, the ministers of the Almighty's displeasure, are
   brought together and exhibited in the most impressive colours; nothing
   can be, more exquisite than the calmness and tranquillity of this
   concluding verse, on which the mind reposes with sensations of
   refreshment and delight." -- Mant.

   PSALM 78

   To comprehend many things within small compass, it is to be observed,
   that in this psalm there are two leading topics. On the one hand, it is
   declared how God adopted for himself a Church from the posterity of
   Abraham, how tenderly and graciously he cherished it, how wonderfully
   he brought it out of Egypt, and how varied were the blessings which he
   bestowed upon it. On the other hand, the Jews, who were so much
   indebted to him for the great blessings which he had conferred upon
   them, are upbraided for having from time to time perversely and
   treacherously revolted from so liberal a father; so that his
   inestimable goodness was clearly manifested, not only in his free
   adoption of them at first, but also in continuing by the uninterrupted
   course of his goodness to strive against the rebellion of so perfidious
   and stiff-necked a people. Moreover, mention is made of the renewal of
   God's grace, and as it were of a second election which he made when he
   chose David out of the tribe of Judah to sway the scepter over the
   kingdom of Israel.

   Psalm 78:1-6

   1. Hearken, O my people! to my law: [307] incline your ears to the
   words of my mouth. 2. I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter
   dark sayings from of old time: 3. What we have heard and known, and our
   fathers have related to us. 4. We will not conceal from their children
   in the generation to come, recounting the praises of Jehovah, and his
   power, and the wonderful works which he has done. 5. He established a
   testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel: for he commanded our
   fathers to make them known to their children: 6. That the generation to
   come might know them, and that the children to be born should arise and
   declare them to their children.


   1. Give ear, O my people! to my law. From the close of the psalm, it
   may with probability be conjectured, that it was written long after the
   death of David; for there we have celebrated the kingdom erected by God
   in the family of David. There also the tribe of Ephraim, which is said
   to have been rejected, is contrasted with, and set in opposition to,
   the house of David. From this it is evident, that the ten tribes were
   at that time in a state of separation from the rest of the chosen
   people; for there must be some good reason why the kingdom of Ephraim
   is branded with a mark of dishonor as being illegitimate and bastard.
   [308]

   Whoever was the inspired writer of this psalm, he does not introduce
   God speaking as is thought by some, but he himself addresses the Jews
   in the character of a teacher. It is no objection to this that he calls
   the people his people, and the law his law; it being no uncommon thing
   for the prophets to borrow the name of Him by whom they were sent, that
   their doctrine might have the greater authority. And, indeed, the truth
   which has been committed to their trust may, with propriety, be called
   theirs. Thus Paul, in Romans 2:16, glories in the gospel as his gospel,
   an expression not to be understood as implying that it was a system
   which owed its origin to him, but that he was a preacher and a witness
   of it. I am somewhat doubtful whether interpreters are strictly correct
   in translating the word tvrh, torah, by law. [309] The meaning of it
   seems to be somewhat more general, as appears from the following
   clause, where the Psalmist uses the phrase, the words of my mouth, in
   the same sense. If we consider with what inattention even those who
   make great professions of being the disciples of God listen to his
   voice, we will admit that the prophet had good reason for introducing
   his lessons of instruction by a solemn call of attention. He does not,
   it is true, address the unteachable and obstinate, who frowardly refuse
   to submit themselves to the word of God; but as even true believers
   themselves are generally too backward to receive instruction, this
   exhortation, so far from being superfluous, was highly necessary to
   stir up the sluggish and inactive among them.

   To secure for himself the greater attention, he declares it to be his
   purpose to discuss subjects of a great, high, and difficult character.
   The word msl, mashal, which I have translated a parable, denotes grave
   and striking sentences, such as adages, or proverbs, and apophthegms.
   [310] As then the matter itself of which we treat, if it is weighty and
   important, awakens the minds of men, the inspired penman affirms that
   it is his purpose to utter only striking sentences and notable sayings.
   The word chydvt, chidoth, which, following others, I have rendered
   enigmas, is here used, not so much for dark sentences, as for sayings
   which are pointed and worthy of special notice. [311] He does not mean
   to wrap up his song in ambiguous language, but clearly and distinctly
   to dwell both upon the benefits of God and the ingratitude of the
   people. Only, as I have said, his design is to stimulate his readers to
   weigh and consider more attentively the subject propounded. This
   passage is quoted by Matthew, (Matthew 13:35,) and applied to the
   person of Christ, when he held the minds of the people in suspense by
   parables which they could not understand. Christ's object in doing so,
   was to prove that he was a distinguished prophet of God, and that thus
   he might be received with the greater reverence. Since he then
   resembled a prophet because he preached sublime mysteries in a style of
   language above the common kind, that which the sacred writer here
   affirms concerning himself, is with propriety transferred to him. If in
   this psalm there shines forth such a majesty as may justly stir up and
   inflame the readers with a desire to learn, we gather from it with what
   earnest attention it becomes us to receive the gospel, in which Christ
   opens and displays to us the treasures of his celestial wisdom.

   3. What we have heard and known. There seems to be some discrepancy
   between what the Psalmist had stated in the commencement, when he said
   that he would speak of great and hidden matters, and what he now adds,
   that his subject is a common one, and such as is transmitted from one
   age to another by the father to the son. If it was incumbent upon the
   fathers to recount to their children the things here spoken of, these
   things ought, of course, to have been familiarly known to all the
   people, yea, even to those who were most illiterate, and had the
   weakest capacity. Where, then, it may be said, are the enigmas or dark
   sentences of which he has just now made mention? I answer, that these
   things can easily be reconciled; for although the psalm contains many
   things which are generally known, yet he illustrates them with all the
   splendor and ornaments of diction, that he may the more powerfully
   affect the hearts of men, and acquire for himself the greater
   authority. At the same time, it is to be observed, that however high
   may be the majesty of the Word of God, this does not prevent the
   benefits or advantages of it from reaching even to the unlearned and to
   babes. The Holy Spirit does not in vain invite and encourage such to
   learn from it: -- a truth which we ought carefully to mark. If God,
   accommodating himself to the limited capacity of men, speaks in an
   humble and lowly style, this manner of teaching is despised as too
   simple; but if he rise to a higher style, with the view of giving
   greater authority to his Word, men, to excuse their ignorance, will
   pretend that it is too obscure. As these two vices are very prevalent
   in the world, the Holy Spirit so tempers his style as that the
   sublimity of the truths which he teaches is not hidden even from those
   of the weakest capacity, provided they are of a submissive and
   teachable disposition, and bring with them an earnest desire to be
   instructed. It is the design of the prophet to remove from the mind all
   doubt respecting his sayings, and for this purpose, he determines to
   bring forward nothing new, but such subjects as had been long well
   known, and received without dispute in the Church. He accordingly not
   only says we have heard, but also we have known. Many things are rashly
   spread abroad which have no foundation in truth; yea, nothing is more
   common than for the ears of men to be filled with fables. It is,
   therefore, not without cause that the prophet, after having spoken of
   the things which he had heard, at the same time, refers in confirmation
   of their truth to undoubted testimony. He adds, that the knowledge of
   these subjects had been communicated to the Jews by their fathers. This
   does not imply, that what is taught under the domestic roof is always
   faultless; but it is obvious, that there is afforded a more favorable
   opportunity of palming upon men forgeries for truth, when things are
   brought from a distant country. What is to be principally observed is,
   that all fathers are not here spoken of indiscriminately, but only
   those who were chosen to be God's peculiar people, and to whom the care
   of divine truth was intrusted.

   4. We will not conceal them from their children in the generation to
   come. Some take the verb nkchd, nechached, in the nephil conjugation,
   and translate it, they are not concealed or hidden. But it ought,
   according to the rules of grammar, to be resolved thus: -- We will not
   conceal them from our posterity, implying, that what we have been
   taught by our ancestors we should endeavor to transmit to their
   children. By this means, all pretense of ignorance is removed; for it
   was the will of God that these things should be published from age to
   age without interruption; so that being transmitted from father to
   child in each family, they might reach even the last family of man. The
   end for which this was to be done is shown -- that they might celebrate
   the praises of Jehovah, in the wonderful works which he hath done

   5. He established a testimony in Jacob. [312] As the reception or
   approbation of any doctrine by men would not be a sufficient reason for
   yielding a firm assent to its truth, the prophet proceeds farther, and
   represents God as the author of what he brings forward. He declares,
   that the father's were not led to instruct their children in these
   truths under the mere impulse of their own minds, but by the
   commandment of God. Some understand the words, He hath established a
   testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, as implying that God
   had established a decree in Jacob, to be observed as an inviolable
   rule, which was, that the deliverance divinely wrought for the people
   should be at all times in the mouth of every Israelite; but this seems
   to give too restricted a sense. I therefore consider statute, or
   testimony, and law, [313] as referring to the written law, which,
   however, was partly given for this end, that by the remembrance of
   their deliverance, the people, after having been once gathered into one
   body, might be kept in their allegiance to God. The meaning then is,
   that God not only acquired a right to the Jews as his people by his
   mighty power, but that he also sealed up his grace, that the knowledge
   of it might never be obliterated. And, undoubtedly, it was then
   registered as it were in public records, when the covenant was ratified
   by the written law, in order to assure the posterity of Abraham that
   they had been separated from all other nations. It would have been a
   matter of very small importance to have been acquainted with, or to
   have remembered the bare history of what had been done, had their eyes
   not been, at the same time, directed to the free adoption and the fruit
   of it. The decree then is this, That the fathers being instructed in
   the doctrine of the law themselves, should recount, as it were, from
   the mouth of God, to their children, that they had been not only once
   delivered, but also gathered into one body as his Church, that
   throughout all ages they might yield a holy and pure obedience to him
   as their deliverer. The reading of the beginning of the second clause
   of the verse properly is, Which he commanded, etc. But the relative
   'sr, asher, which, I have no doubt, is here put by way of exposition
   for namely, or that is, he commanded, etc. I have translated it for,
   which amounts to the same thing.

   6. That the generation to come might know them. In this verse, the
   Psalmist confirms what he had said concerning the continued
   transmission of divine truth. It greatly concerns us to know, that the
   law was given not for one age only; but that the fathers should
   transmit it to their children, as if it were their rightful
   inheritance, in order that it might never be lost, but be preserved to
   the end of the world. This is the reason why Paul, in 1 Timothy 3:15,
   asserts that "the Church is the pillar and ground of the truth;" by
   which he does not mean that the truth of itself is weak, and stands in
   need of foreign supports, but that God extends and diffuses it by the
   instrumentality of his ministers, who when they faithfully execute the
   office of teaching with which they are invested, sustain the truth, as
   it were, upon their shoulders. Now, the prophet teaches us, that it is
   our bounden duty to use our endeavors that there may be a continual
   succession of persons to communicate instruction in divine truth. It is
   said of Abraham before the law was written, Genesis 18:19,

   "I know him, that he will command his children and his household after
   him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and
   judgment;"

   and after his death, this was enjoined upon the patriarchs as a
   necessary part of their duty. No sooner was the law delivered, than God
   appointed priests in his Church to be public masters and teachers. He
   has also testified by the prophet Isaiah, that the same is to be
   observed under the New Testament dispensation, saying,

   "My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
   mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy
   seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, from henceforth and for
   ever." (Isaiah 59:21)

   In the passage before us, however, a particular injunction is given to
   the fathers on this point -- each of them is enjoined diligently to
   instruct his own children, and all without distinction are taught, that
   their exertions in transmitting the name of God to their posterity will
   be most acceptable to Him, and receive his highest approbation. By the
   words, That the children to be born should arise, is not denoted a
   small number of individuals; but it is intimated, that the preachers of
   divine truth, by whose efforts pure religion may flourish and prevail
   for ever, will be as numerous as those who are born into the world.

   [307] "Ou, ma doctrine." -- Fr. marg. "Or, my doctrine, or
   instruction."

   [308] Calmet refers the composition of this psalm to the days of Asa,
   who, aided by the Syrians, obtained a signal victory over the
   Israelites, and brought back to the pure worship of God many out of the
   tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon. See 2 Chronicles 15 and 16.
   Schnurrer supposes, that the special purpose for which it was composed
   was, to celebrate a decisive victory which had been gained over the
   kingdom of Ephraim or Israel by Abijah, the king of Judah during the
   reign of Jeroboam. Walford thinks this opinion highly probable. "There
   is," say's he, "an eulogy passed upon David at the conclusion of the
   psalm, which makes it likely that the author of it wished to conciliate
   the favor of the whole people towards David's successors, from whom
   Jeroboam had revolted: and in verse 9th, there is a reference to
   Ephraim which affords some degree of evidence in support of Schnurrer's
   hypothesis. Whatever may be thought of this hypothesis, we cannot
   hesitate to admit that the psalm itself is clear, pungent, and
   persuasive, and must have been felt to be so by the persons for whose
   use it was written."

   [309] We have seen that Calvin, on the margin of the French version,
   reads instruction, and this reading is adopted by Street, Fry, Morison,
   and Walford.

   [310] See [11]volume 2, page 238, note 2.

   [311] Walford translates chydvt, chidoth, "all impressive record." His
   version of the first and second verses is, "Hear, O my people! my
   instruction:
   Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
   I will open my mouth with an instructive speech,
   I will utter an impressive record of ancient times." "The words law,
   parable, and dark sayings," he observes, "which are found in the
   English translation of verses 1st and 2d, are not appropriate to the
   recitals which are contained in the psalm. They are here altered for
   others, which are in agreement with the subjects which follow, and may
   be supported by the usage of the original words which are employed."
   Similar is Street's note on this place. He translates chydvt, chidoth,
   "pointed truths," and objects to its being translated dark sayings
   "There is nothing obscure in the psalm," says he, "it contains
   instructive historical truth, but no enigma. Therefore, the rendering
   of the English Bible, dark sayings, does not seem to be right. The
   Septuagint renders the word diegema, Ezekiel 17:2, and that rendering
   would suit this place better than prothlemata I have endeavored to
   express the relation of the word to chdd, acutum est." See [12]volume 2
   of this work, page 238, note 3. But as Dimock observes, "The several
   transactions of the Mosaical covenant hereafter recited, might be well
   called parables and dark speeches, or, as Arabic, mysteries, considered
   as types or figures of the Christian; and viewed in this light, afford
   ample matter of contemplation, serving not only as a schoolmaster to
   bring us unto Christ, but to keep us steadfast in faith and obedience
   to David our king."

   [312] Horsley considers this verse as a parenthesis.

   [313] Dr Adam Clarke, by a testimony understands the various
   ordinances, rites, and ceremonies prescribed by the laws and by the
   word law, the moral law.

   Psalm 78:7-11

   7. That they might set their hope [314] in God, and not forget the
   works of God; but keep his commandments. 8. And that they might not be
   as their fathers, a rebellious [or an apostatising] and a provoking
   generation; a generation which directed not their heart aright, and
   whose spirit was not faithful towards God. 9. The children of Ephraim,
   being armed and shooting with the bow, turned back in the day of
   battle. 10. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in
   his law. 11. And they forgat his works, and the wonders which he had
   shown them.


   7. That they might set their hope in God. Here the Psalmist points out
   the use to which the doctrine which he had stated should be applied. In
   the first place, the fathers, when they find that on the one hand they
   are instrumental in maintaining the pure worship of God, and that on
   the other, they are the means of providing for the salvation of their
   children, should, by such a precious result of their labors, be the
   more powerfully stirred up to instruct their children. In the second
   place, the children on their part, being inflamed with greater zeal,
   should eagerly press forward in the acquisition of divine knowledge,
   and not suffer their minds to wander in vain speculations, but should
   aim at, or keep their eyes directed to, the right mark. It is unhappy
   and wretched toil to be

   "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of
   the truth," (2 Timothy 3:7.)

   When, therefore, we hear for what purpose the law was given, we may
   easily learn what is the true and most successful method of deriving
   benefit from it. The inspired writer places trust first, assigning it
   the highest rank. He then requires the observance of the holy
   commandments of God; and he puts in the middle the remembrance of the
   works of God, which serves to confirm and strengthen faith. In short,
   what he means is, that the sum of heavenly wisdom consists in this,
   that men, having their hearts fixed on God by a true and unfeigned
   faith, call upon him, and that, for the purpose of maintaining and
   cherishing their confidence in him, they exercise themselves in
   meditating in good earnest upon his benefits; and that then they yield
   to him an unfeigned and devoted obedience. We may learn from this, that
   the true service of God begins with faith. If we transfer our trust and
   confidence to any other object, we defraud him of the chief part of his
   honor.

   8. And that they might not be as their fathers, a rebellious and
   provoking generation. The Psalmist here shows still more distinctly how
   necessary this sermon was, from the circumstance that the Jews were
   exceedingly prone to revolt from God, if they were not kept in
   subjection by powerful restraints. He takes it as a fact, which could
   not be questioned, that their hearts were in no respect better than the
   hearts of their fathers, whom he affirms to have been a treacherous,
   rebellious, crooked and disobedient race. They would, therefore,
   immediately backslide from the way of God, unless their hearts were
   continually sustained by stable supports. The experience of all ages
   shows that what Horace writes concerning his own nation is true every
   where: --

   "Ætas parenturn, pejor avis, tulit
   Nos nequiores, mox daturos
   Progeniem vitiosiroem."
   Odes, Book III. Ode vi.

   "The age that gave our fathers birth,
   Saw them their noble sires disgrace:
   We, baser still, shall leave on earth
   The still increasing guilt of our degenerate race."
   Boscawen'Translation.

   What then would be the consequence, did not God succor the world which
   thus proceeds from evil to worse? As the prophet teaches the Jews from
   the wickedness and perverseness of their fathers, that they stood in
   need of a severe discipline to recall them from the imitation of bad
   examples, we learn from this, how great the folly of the world is, in
   persuading itself that the example of the fathers is to be regarded as
   equivalent to a law, which ought, in every case, to be followed. He
   does not here speak of all people without distinction, but of the holy
   and chosen race of Abraham; nor does he rebuke a small number of
   persons, but almost the whole nation, among whom there prevailed
   excessive obstinacy, as well as perverse forgetfulness of the grace of
   God, and perfidious dissimulation. He does not mention merely the
   fathers of one age, but he comprehends a period stretching back into a
   remote antiquity, that persons may not take occasion to excuse
   themselves in committing sin, from the length of time during which it
   has prevailed. We must therefore make a wise selection from amongst the
   fathers of those whom it becomes us to imitate. It being a work of
   great difficulty to remove the disposition to this perverse imitation
   of the fathers, towards whom the feeling of reverence is naturally
   impressed on the minds of their successors, the prophet employs a
   multiplicity of terms to set forth the aggravated wickedness of the
   fathers, stigmatising them as chargeable with apostasy, provocation,
   treachery, and hypocrisy. These are very weighty charges; but it will
   be evident from the sequel that they are not exaggerated. The word
   hkyn, hechin, which I have rendered directed, is by some translated
   established, but in my opinion, the meaning rather is, that God's
   ancient people always turned aside from God into crooked by-paths.
   Also, in what follows, instead of reading whose spirit was not faithful
   towards God, some read whose spirit leaned not upon God. [315] But it
   is better to follow the former interpretation, That they were not
   faithfully and steadfastly devoted to God, although they had solemnly
   sworn allegiance to him. The Papists make use of this passage as an
   argument to prove that man has the power of bending his own heart, and
   directing it either to good or evil as he pleases; but this is an
   inference from it which cannot stand examination for a single moment.
   Although the prophet justly blames those who have not directed their
   heart aright, his object is not expressly to speak of what men can do
   of themselves. It is the special work of God to turn to himself the
   hearts of men by the secret influence of his Holy Spirit. It does not
   however follow from this, that they will be exempted from blame, when
   their own lust and depravity draw them away from God. Moreover, from
   the sins which are here reproved, we should learn in what way he would
   have us to obey and serve him. In the first place, we must lay aside
   all obstinacy and take his yoke upon us; [316] and, secondly, we must
   clothe ourselves with the spirit of meekness, bring the affections of
   the heart to the obedience of God, and follow after uprightness, and
   that not with the fervor of a mere transient impulse, but with
   unfeigned and unwavering steadfastness.

   9. The children of Ephraim being armed, and shooting with the bow. The
   sacred writer sets before us an example of this unfaithfulness in the
   children of Ephraim. As those who are pertinaciously set upon doing
   evil are not easily led to repentance and reformation by simple
   instruction, the punishments with which God visited the children of
   Ephraim are brought forward, and by these it is proved that they were
   reprobates. Since they were a warlike people, it was an evidence of the
   divine displeasure for them to turn their backs in battle. And it is
   expressly declared, that they were skillful in shooting with the bow;
   [317] for it is an additional stigma to represent such as were armed
   with weapons to wound their enemies at a distance as fleeing through
   fear. From this, it is the more abundantly manifest that they had
   incurred the displeasure of God, who not only deprived them of his aid,
   but also made their hearts effeminate in the hour of danger.

   Here the question may be raised, Why the children of Ephraim only are
   blamed, when we find a little before, all the tribes in general
   comprehended in the same sentence of condemnation? Some commentators
   refer this to the slaughter of the sons of Ephraim by the men of Gath,
   who came forth against them to recover their cattle of which they had
   been despoiled, 1 Chronicles 7:20, 21, 22. [318] But this exposition is
   too restricted. Perhaps the kingdom of Israel had fallen into decay,
   and had been almost ruined when this psalm was composed. It is
   therefore better to follow the opinion of other interpreters, who
   think, that by the figure synecdoche, the children of Ephraim are put
   for the whole people. But these interpreters pass over without
   consideration the fact, which ought not to be overlooked, that the
   Ephraimites are purposely named because they were the means of leading
   others into that rebellion which took place when Jeroboam set up the
   calves, (1 Kings 12:25-33.) What we have already said must be borne in
   mind, that towards the close of the psalm, the rejection of the tribe
   of Ephraim is, not, without cause, contrasted with the election of the
   tribe of Judah. The children of Ephraim are also here spoken of by way
   of comparison, to warn the true children of Abraham from the example of
   those who cut themselves off from the Church, and yet boasted of the
   title of the Church without exhibiting holy fruits in their life. [319]
   As they surpassed all the other tribes in number and wealth, their
   influence was too powerful in beguiling the simple; but of this the
   prophet now strips them, showing that they were deprived of the aid of
   God.

   10. They kept not the covenant of God. This is the reason assigned for
   the Ephraimites turning their backs in the day of battle; and it
   explains why the divine assistance was withheld from them. Others, it
   is true, were guilty in this respect as well as they, but the vengeance
   of God executed on that tribe, which by its influence had corrupted
   almost the whole kingdom, is purposely brought forward as a general
   warning. Since then the tribe of Ephraim, in consequence of its
   splendor and dignity, when it threw off the yoke, encouraged and became
   as it were a standard of shameful revolt to all the other tribes, the
   prophet intended to put people on their guard, that they might not
   suffer themselves in their simplicity to be again deceived in the same
   manner. It is no light charge which he brings against the sons of
   Ephraim: he upbraids them on account of their perfidiousness in
   despising the whole law and in violating the covenant. Although he
   employs these two words, law and covenant, in the same sense; yet, in
   placing the covenant first, he clearly shows that he is speaking not
   only of the moral law, the all-perfect rule of life, but of the whole
   service of God, of the truth and faithfulness of the divine promises,
   and of the trust which ought to be reposed in them, [320] of
   invocation, and of the doctrine of true religion, the foundation
   whereof was the adoption. He therefore calls them covenant-breakers,
   because they had fallen from their trust in the promises, by which God
   had entered into covenant with them to be their Father. Yet he
   afterwards very properly adds the law, in which the covenant was sealed
   up, as it were, in public records. He aggravates the enormity of their
   guilt by the word refuse, which intimates that they were not simply
   carried away by a kind of thoughtless or inconsiderate recklessness,
   and thus sinned through giddiness, want of knowledge or foresight, but
   that they had purposely, and with deliberate obstinacy, violated the
   holy covenant of God.

   11. And they forgat his works. This shameful impiety is here
   represented as having originated in ingratitude, inasmuch as they
   wickedly buried, and made no account of the deliverance wrought for
   them, which was worthy of everlasting remembrance. Truly it was
   stupidity more than brutish, or rather, as it were, a monstrous thing,
   [321] for the Israelites to depart from God, to whom they were under so
   many and strong obligations. Nor would it have been possible for them
   to have been so bewitched by Satan, had they not quite forgotten the
   many miracles wrought in their behalf, which formed so many bonds to
   keep them in the fear of God and in obedience to him. That no excuse
   might be left for extenuating their guilt, the prophet ennobles those
   works by applying to them the term wonderful, thereby intimating, that
   God's manner of acting was not of a common kind, so as easily to
   account for their gradually forgetting his works, but that the
   Israelites had perversely and wickedly shut their eyes, that they might
   not be restrained in their sinful course, by beholding the glory of
   God.

   Fr. In the first place, we must lay aside all obstinacy before we can
   bend our necks to receive his yoke.

   [317] Of the Ephraimites shooting with the bow, or being archers, we
   have an intimation in Genesis 49:24, where, in Jacob's blessing on
   Joseph, the father of Ephraim, it is said, "His bow abode in strength."

   [318] Dr Morison supposes, that the history here referred to, is that
   of the Israelites going up contrary to the divine command to take
   possession of the promised land, when, for their temerity, they were
   smitten and humbled before their enemies. (Deuteronomy 1:42.) "The
   tribe of Ephraim," he observes, "is doubtless specially singled out,
   because they were the most warlike of all the chosen tribes, and
   because, perhaps, they led on the other tribes to the fatal act of
   rebellion against the expressed will of the God of Israel." This,
   perhaps, may be considered as receiving some support from comparing the
   number of the tribe of Ephraim (Numbers 2:19) when they came out of
   Egypt, with their number when taken in the plains of Moab, at the
   termination of their wanderings in the wilderness, (Numbers 26:37.) At
   the former period, they amounted to 40,500, at the latter, to 32,500,
   eight thousand less; whereas, during those forty years the other tribes
   had considerably increased.

   Psalm 78:12-16

   12. He wrought marvellously [or he did wondrous things] in the sight of
   their fathers; in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. [322] 13. He
   divided the sea, and caused them to pass through, and made the waters
   to stand as an heap. 14. And he led them by a cloud in the day; and all
   the night by the light of fire. 15. He clave the rocks in the
   wilderness: and made them to drink in great deeps. 16. And he brought
   forth streams from the rock, and made the waters to run down like
   rivers.


   12. He wrought marvellously in the sight of their fathers. The Psalmist
   is still to be regarded as condemning the posterity of the Israelites
   for their guilt; but he very properly, at the same time, begins to
   speak of the first ancestors of the nation, intimating, that the whole
   race of them, even from their first original, were of a perverse and
   rebellious disposition. But having remarked that the children of
   Ephraim had fallen into apostasy, because they had forgotten the
   wonderful works of God, he continues to prosecute the same subject.
   Meanwhile, as I have said, he makes a very happy transition to speak of
   the fathers, whom it was his object to include in the same
   condemnation. In the first place, he adverts to the miracles which were
   wrought in the midst of the land of Egypt, previous to the departure of
   the people from it. To recall these the more vividly to the mind, he
   names a place which was highly celebrated -- the field of Zoan. He next
   comes to speak of the passage through the sea, where he repeats what
   was brought under our notice in the previous psalm, that the order of
   nature was reversed when the waters stopped in their course, and were
   even raised up into solid heaps like mountains. In the third place, he
   declares, that after the people had passed through the Red Sea, God
   still continued to be their guide in their journey; and that this might
   not be a mere temporary deliverance, he graciously continued to stretch
   forth his hand to bestow upon them new testimonies of his goodness. It
   being a difficult and wearisome thing for them to pursue their journey
   through dry and sandy regions, it was no ordinary blessing to be
   protected from the heat of the sun by the intervention of a cloud.
   This, however, was to them a pledge of more distinguished grace. God
   hereby testified, that this people were under his protection, until
   they should reach the heavenly inheritance. Accordingly, Paul teaches
   in 1 Corinthians 10:2, that there was a kind of baptism administered to
   the people in that cloud, as also in their passing through the sea; the
   fruit of which is not limited to this frail and transitory life, but
   extends even to everlasting salvation.

   15. He clave the rocks in the wilderness. The Psalmist produces another
   evidence of the fatherly love by which God testified the greatness of
   the care which he exercised about the welfare of this people. It is not
   simply said that God gave them drink, but that he did this in a
   miraculous manner. Streams, it is true, sometimes issue from rocks, but
   the rock which Moses smote was completely dry. Whence it is evident,
   that the water was not brought forth from any spring, but that it was
   made to flow from the profoundest deeps, as if it had been said, from
   the very center of the earth. Those, therefore, who have interpreted
   this passage as meaning, that the Israelites drank in the bottomless
   deeps, because the waters flowed in great abundance, have failed in
   giving the true explanation. Moses, in his history of the miracle,
   rather enhances its greatness, by intimating, that God commanded those
   waters to come gushing from the remotest veins.

   The same truth is confirmed in the following verse, in which it is
   stated, that where there had not been a single drop of water before
   there was a large and mighty river. Had there only sprung out of the
   rock a small rivulet, ungodly men might have had some apparent ground
   for cavilling at, and underrating the goodness of God, but when the
   water gushed out in such copious abundance all on a sudden, who does
   not see that the ordinary course of nature was changed, rather than
   that some vein or spring which lay hidden in the earth was opened?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [322] Zoan was the ancient capital of Egypt where the Pharaohs resided.
   Its great antiquity appears from the expression used respecting Hebron,
   in Numbers 13:22, where, to set forth the antiquity of that city, in
   which Abraham the tenth from Noah dwelt, it is said, that it "was built
   seven years before Zoan in Egypt." Zoan is twice specified in this
   psalm, here and in verse 43d, (though not mentioned in the history of
   the plagues in the book of Exodus,) as the scene of the wonderful works
   wrought on Pharaoh and the land of Egypt by Moses. This may mean, that
   these miracles were performed there in the sight of Pharaoh. Or the
   field or country of Zoan, may be put poetically for Egypt in general.
   Thus, in other poetical parts of Scripture, Zoan is sometimes used
   instead of Egypt, as in Isaiah 19:11, 13, where "the princes of Zoan"
   just mean the counsellors of Pharaoh; and in Isaiah 30:4, where, when
   God's ancient people are represented as sending to Egypt for relief, it
   is said, that their "princes were at Zoan." Zoan is rendered by the
   Chaldee t'nym, by the LXX. Tanis, by the Vulgate Tanis, and by the
   Coptic Tane, from the Coptic ten, plain, flat, level; being situated on
   the low ground of the Delta, on one of the Eastern branches of the
   Nile, bearing its own name, near a large lake, now called the Lake of
   Menzala, 44 miles west of Pelusium, 169 miles east of Alexandria, and
   three miles from the Mediterranean. There are ruins still remaining to
   mark the site of Zoan or Tanis, called San by the Arabs, comprising
   broken obelisks, capitals of the Corinthian order, a granite monument,
   etc. These ruins, however, are not thought to be of the highest
   antiquity.

   Psalm 78:17-22

   17. Yet they continued still to sin against him, to provoke the Most
   High in the wilderness. 18. And they tempted God in their heart, by
   asking food for their soul. [323] 19. And they spake against God: they
   said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 20. Behold! he smote
   the rock, and the waters gushed out; and streams overflowed. Can he
   give bread also? Can he prepare flesh for his people? 21. Therefore
   Jehovah heard, and was wroth: and a fire was kindled in Jacob: and
   wrath also ascended against Israel? [324] 22. Because they believed not
   in God, nor trusted in his salvation.


   17. Yet they continued still to sin against him. The prophet, having
   briefly declared how God, by a continual succession of benefits, had
   clearly manifested the greatness of his love towards the children of
   Abraham, now adds, that after having been laid under such deep and
   solemn obligations to him, they, as was natural to them, and according
   to their customary way, wickedly rebelled against him. In the first
   place, he accuses them of having provoked him grievously, by
   pertinaciously adding iniquity to iniquity; and then he points out the
   particular kind of the provocation with which they were chargeable. By
   the word provoke, he intimates, that it was no light offense which they
   had committed, but wickedness so heinous and aggravated as not to be
   endured. From the place in which it was committed, he aggravates the
   enormity of the sin. It was in the very wilderness, whilst the
   remembrance of their deliverance was yet fresh in their memory, and
   where they had every day full in their view tokens of the presence of
   God, and where even necessity itself should have constrained them to
   yield a true and holy obedience -- it was in that place, and under
   these circumstances, that they repressed not their insolence and
   unbridled appetite. [325] It was then, certainly, a proof of monstrous
   infatuation for them to act in such a wanton and disgraceful manner as
   they did, at the very time when their want of all things should have
   proved the best remedy for keeping them under restraint, and to do this
   even in the presence of God, who presented before them such
   manifestations of his glory as filled them with terror, and who allured
   them so kindly and tenderly to himself.

   18. And they tempted God in their heart. This is the provocation of
   which mention is made in the preceding verse. Not that it was unlawful
   for them simply to ask food, when constrained to do so by the cravings
   of hunger. Who can impute blame to persons, when being hungry, they
   implore God to supply their necessities? The sin with which the
   Israelites were chargeable consisted in this, that not content with the
   food which He had appointed them, they gave loose reins to their lusts.
   He, at that time, had begun to feed them with manna, as we shall again
   see by and by. It was their loathing of that sustenance which impelled
   them eagerly to desire new food, as if they disdained the allowance
   assigned them by their heavenly Father. This is what is meant when it
   is said that they asked food for their soul [326] They were not reduced
   to the necessity of asking it by hunger; but their lust was not
   satisfied with living on the provision which God had appointed for
   them. On this account, it is declared, that they tempted God,
   overpassing, as they did, the bounds within which he had limited them.
   Whoever, undervaluing and despising the permission or license which He
   grants, gives full scope to his own intemperate lust, and desires more
   than is lawful, is said to tempt God. He acts as if he would subject
   Him to his own caprice, or questioned whether He could do more than he
   is pleased really to do. God has power to accomplish whatever he wills;
   and assuredly, the person who would separate the power of God from his
   will, or represent him as unable to do what he wills, does all he can
   to rend him in pieces. Those are chargeable with doing this, who are
   set upon trying whether he will grant more than he has given them
   permission to ask. That, therefore, the lust of the flesh may not stir
   us up to tempt him, let us learn to impose a restraint upon our
   desires, and humbly to rest contented within the limits which are
   prescribed to us. If the flesh is allowed to indulge itself without
   control, we will not be satisfied with ordinary bread, but will often,
   and in many ways, murmur against God.

   19. And they spake against God. The prophet had said that they tempted
   God in their heart; [327] and now he adds, that they were not ashamed
   openly to utter with their impure and blasphemous tongues, the impiety
   which they had inwardly conceived. From this, it is the more abundantly
   manifest that malignity and wickedness had taken entire possession of
   their hearts. Thus we see how lust conceives sin, when it is admitted
   into the soul with unhallowed consent. Afterwards the sin develops
   itself farther, even as we see the Israelites proceeding to such a
   length of profane wantonness, as to call in question the power of God,
   as if they made no account of it, any farther than as it ministered to
   their lust. By the table prepared which is spoken of, is to be
   understood the dainty food, which was their ordinary fare in Egypt. A
   single dish did not satisfy their appetite. They were not contented
   unless they could gratify themselves with great abundance and variety.
   When it is said in the following verse, Behold! God smote the rock, and
   the waters gushed out, etc., this, I have no doubt, is the language of
   bitter irony, with which the prophet taunts their unblushing insolence.
   It is not very likely that they spake in this manner; but he relates,
   as it were, with their mouth, or in their person, the things which took
   place before their eyes.

   21. Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth. This hearing of God implies
   full and perfect knowledge; and it is a figure taken from earthly
   judges, who cannot punish criminals until they have become thoroughly
   acquainted with the cause. He is said to hear his own people, when he
   shows his favor and mercy towards them by granting their requests; and,
   on the other hand, he is said to hear those blasphemies which he does
   not allow to pass unpunished. To remove all ground for thinking that
   the divine wrath was unduly severe, the enormity of the guilt of the
   Israelites is again described as manifested in this, that they believed
   not God, nor trusted in his salvation. It is here taken as an
   indisputable point, that promises were made to them to which they ought
   to have yielded an assent, which, however, they were prevented from
   yielding by the extreme infatuation with which they were carried away.
   To trust in the salvation of God, is to lean upon his fatherly
   providence, and to regard him as sufficient for the supply of all our
   wants. From this we learn not only how hateful unbelief is in the sight
   of God, but also, what is the true nature of faith, and what are the
   fruits which it produces. Whence is it that men quietly submit
   themselves to Him, but because they are persuaded that their salvation
   is singularly precious in his sight, and are fully assured that he will
   give them whatever is needful for them? It is thus that they are led to
   surrender themselves to him, to be governed according to his good
   pleasure. Faith, then, is the root of true piety. It teaches us to hope
   for, and to desire every blessing from God, and it frames us to yield
   obedience to him; while those who distrust him must necessarily be
   always murmuring and rebelling against him. The scope of the prophet is
   this, that the pretences to faith which are made by those who do not
   hope for salvation from God, rest upon false grounds; for when God is
   believed in, the hope of salvation is speedily produced in the mind,
   and this hope renders to him the praise of every blessing.

   Psalm 78:23-25

   23. But he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of
   heaven, 24. And had rained down manna [328] upon them to eat, and had
   given them of the corn of heaven. 25. Man had eaten the bread of the
   mighty: he had sent them meat to the full.


   23. But he had commanded the clouds from above. It is a mistake to
   suppose that this miracle is related merely in the way of history. The
   prophet rather censures the Israelites the more severely from the
   consideration, that although fed to the full with manna, they ceased
   not to lust after the dainties which they knew God had denied them. It
   was the basest ingratitude to scorn and reject the heavenly food,
   which, so to speak, associated them with angels. Were a man who dwells
   in France or Italy to grieve and fret that he has not the bread of
   Egypt to eat, nor the wine of Asia to drink, would he not make war
   against God and nature, after the manner of the giants of old? Much
   less excusable was the inordinate lust of the Israelites, whom God not
   only furnished with earthly provision in rich abundance, but to whom he
   also gave the bread of heaven for their support. Had they even endured
   hunger for a lengthened period, propriety and duty would have required
   them to ask food with more humility. Had they been supplied with only
   bran and chaff to eat, it would have been their bounden duty to have
   acknowledged that in the place where they were -- in the wilderness --
   this was no ordinary boon of Heaven. Had only coarse bread been granted
   them, they would have had sufficient reason for thanksgiving. But how
   much stronger were their obligations to God, when he created a new kind
   of food, with which, by stretching out, as it were, his hand from
   heaven, he supplied them richly and in great abundance? This is the
   reason why the manna is called corn of heaven, and bread of the mighty
   Some explain the Hebrew word 'vyrym, abbirim, as denoting the heavens,
   [329] an opinion which I do not altogether reject. I, however, prefer
   taking it for angels, as it is understood by the Chaldee interpreter,
   and some others who have followed him. [330] The miracle is celebrated
   in high terms, to present the impiety of the people in a more
   detestable light; for it was a much more striking display of divine
   power for manna to be rained down from heaven, than if they had been
   fed either with herbs or fruits, or with other increase of the earth.
   Paul, in 1 Corinthians 10:3, calls the manna spiritual meat, in a
   different sense -- because it was a figure and symbol of Christ. But
   here the design of the prophet is to reprove the twofold ingratitude of
   the people, who despised not only the common food which was produced
   from the ground, but also the bread of angels. Some have translated the
   verbs in the past tense, He commanded the clouds -- he opened the doors
   of heaven -- he rained down manna, etc [331] But to remove all
   ambiguity, I have thought it preferable to translate the verbs in the
   preterpluperfect tense, He had commanded, he had opened, he had rained,
   to enable my readers the better to understand that the prophet does not
   here simply relate this history, but recalls it to remembrance for
   another purpose, as a thing which happened long ago.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [328] The manna received its name, either from mnh, manah, he prepared,
   appointed, distributed, to intimate that this food was prepared by God
   for the Israelites, and was their appointed portion which was daily
   distributed to them by measure; or, it is from the words hvh mn, huh
   man, What is this? Exodus 15:16, n being used for h in euphony. This
   was the question which they asked when they first saw this species of
   food, not knowing what it was.

   [329] Abu Walid and Kimchi read, "the bread of heaven."

   [330] The Chaldee paraphrase of the expression, the bread of the
   mighty, is, "the food that descends from the dwelling of angels;" so
   that, according to this view, it signifies no more than, "corn of
   heaven," by which the manna is described in the preceding verse. Dr
   Geddes and Williams observe, that the Hebrew word 'vyrym, abbirim,
   never signifies angels, but persons of the higher classes, the rich,
   the great, the noble; and that the meaning of the Psalmist is, that the
   Israelites found in the manna a dainty, delicate food, such as might
   suit the palates of the great; that it was bread fit for princes; the
   best, the choicest of bread. This agrees with Simonis' rendering of the
   phrase, "cibus nobilium, scilicet principum; hoc est, cibus exquisitus,
   delicatus, eximius." Such also is the view taken by Fry, Walford, and
   others. If by 'vyrym, abbirim, the mighty, angels should be understood,
   as it is rendered in all the ancient versions, the meaning will be
   substantially the same; for the manna, by an obvious poetical figure,
   may be called the bread of angels, to denote food of the most exquisite
   kind; just as Paul speaks of the tongues of angels, (1 Corinthians
   13:1,) to indicate eloquence of the highest order.

   commande aux nuees, Il a ouvert les portes du ciel, Il a fait pluvoir

   Psalm 78:26-31

   26. He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens; and by his power he
   raised up the south wind. 27. And he rained upon them flesh as dust,
   and feathered fowl [332] as the sand of the sea; 28. And he caused it
   to fall in the midst of his camp, [333] round about his tabernacles.
   29. And they did eat and were filled, and he gave them their desire.
   30. They were not estranged from their desire: the meat was still in
   their mouth, 31. When the wrath of God ascended against them, and slew
   the fat ones among them, and brought low the chosen of Israel.


   26. He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens. We have here related
   how God granted the request of his people. This does not imply that he
   favourably regarded their fretful desires, but that he showed by the
   effect that it was in his power to do what they believed it to be
   impossible for him to accomplish. From this, we may perceive how
   injudiciously some expositors here join together the flesh and the
   manna. The reason why the flesh was given was altogether different from
   that for which the manna was given. God, in giving the manna, performed
   the office of a father; but by the flesh, he satisfied their gluttonous
   desires, that their very greediness in devouring it might choke them.
   It would not have been a difficult matter for God to have created
   quails in the midst of the wilderness; but he chose rather to bring
   them by the force of the winds, to teach the Israelites that all the
   elements are obedient to his command, and that the distance of places
   cannot prevent his power from immediately penetrating from the east
   even to the west. [334] That unbelieving people, therefore, were
   furnished with an undoubted proof of the power of God, from which they
   had malignantly detracted, in seeing all the elements of nature ready
   to obey and promptly to execute whatever he has commanded. Besides, he
   no doubt raised the winds according to the situation of the camp,
   although it would have been easy for him, without any means, to have
   presented flesh before them. It is stated, that they did eat and were
   filled, not only to intimate that God brought to them a large supply of
   birds, with which their bellies might be stuffed to the full; but also,
   that it was ungovernable lust which led them to ask flesh, and not a
   solicitude for having provision on which to live. It has been said
   above, that manna had been given them in the greatest abundance, but
   here it is intended expressly to censure their gluttony, in which they
   gave manifest proof of their unbridled appetite. God promises, in Psalm
   145:19, as a peculiar privilege to those who fear him, that "he will
   fulfill their desire;" but it is in a different way that he is here
   said to have yielded to the perverse desires of the people, who had
   cast off all fear of him; for that which his favor and loving-kindness
   would have led him to refuse, he now granted them in his wrath. This is
   an example well worthy of our attention, that we may not complain if
   our desires are frowned upon and crossed by the secret providence of
   God when they break forth beyond bounds. God then truly hears us, when,
   instead of yielding to our foolish inclinations, he regulates his
   beneficence according to the measure of our welfare; even as in
   lavishing upon the wicked more than is good for them, he cannot,
   properly speaking, be said to hear them: he rather loads them with a
   deadly burden, which serves to cast them down headlong into
   destruction.

   The Psalmist expresses this still more clearly, by adding immediately
   after, (verses 30, 31,) that this pampering proved fatal to them, as if
   with the meat they had swallowed the flame of the divine wrath. When he
   says that they were not estranged from their lust, this implies, that
   they were still burning with their lust. If it is objected that this
   does not agree with the preceding sentence, where it is said, that
   "they did eat, and were thoroughly filled," I would answer, that if, as
   is well known, the minds of men are not kept within the bounds of
   reason and temperance, they become insatiable; and, therefore, a great
   abundance will not extinguish the fire of a depraved appetite. Some
   translate the clause, They were not disappointed, and others, They did
   not yet loathe their meat. This last translation brings out the meaning
   very well; but it is too far removed from the signification of the
   Hebrew word zvr, zur, which I have rendered estranged. The prophet
   intended to express in two words a present felt pleasure; for when God
   executed vengeance upon the people, they still indulged in the
   excessive gratification of the palate. [335] The wrath of God is said
   metaphorically to ascend, when he suddenly rises up to execute
   judgment; for when he apparently shuts his eyes and takes no notice of
   our sins, he seems, so to speak, to be asleep. The punishment was felt
   by persons of every condition among the Israelites; but the fat ones
   [336] and the chosen are expressly named, in order to exhibit the
   judgment of God in a light still more conspicuous. It did not happen by
   chance that the most robust and vigorous were attacked and cut off by
   the plague. As the strong are commonly deceived by their strength, and
   proudly exalt themselves against God, forgetting their own weakness,
   and thinking that they may do whatever they please, it is not
   surprising to find that the wrath of God burned more fiercely against
   such persons than against others.

   [334] The Israelites were miraculously supplied with quails in the
   wilderness on two different occasions. The first occasion was upon the
   fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from Egypt, and
   before they came to mount Sinai, Exodus 16:1, 12, 13. The second, which
   is the one here referred to, was at Kibroth-hattaavah, a place three
   days' journey beyond the desert of Sinai, in the beginning of the
   second year after their departure from Egypt, Numbers 10:11; and
   11:31-35. In both instances, the quails were sent in consequence of the
   murmuring of the Israelites. But in the first instance, they came up
   and covered the camp of Israel only one evening, while in the second,
   they came up from the sea for a whole month. No token of the divine
   displeasure accompanied the first miracle, God having, in his
   compassion, forgiven their murmuring; but the second miracle was
   wrought in wrath, and attended with the infliction of the divine
   vengeance on that rebellious people, (Numbers 11:33.)

   [335] "While their meat was yet in their mouth; the meat of the quails,
   while it was between their teeth, ere it was chewed, and before it was
   swallowed down, while they were rolling this sweet morsel under their
   tongues, and were gorging themselves with it, destruction came upon
   them; just as Belshazzar, while he was feasting with his nobles, in the
   midst of his mirth and jollity, was slain by the Persians, Daniel 5:1,
   30." -- Dr Gill.

   [336] Mr Mudge observes, that this clause should be translated, "Slew
   them amidst their fatnesses or indulgences." This is approved of by
   Lowth. Cocceius and Michaelis give a similar version.

   Psalm 78:32-37

   32. For all this they still sinned, and believed not his wondrous works
   33. And he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in haste.
   [337] 34. When he slew them, then they sought him; they returned, and
   hastened early to God. 35. And they remembered that God was their Rock,
   and that the High God was their Redeemer. 36. And they flattered him
   with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 37. But their
   heart was not right before him, neither were they faithful in his
   covenant


   32. For all this they still sinned. It is a common proverb, that fools
   become wise when the rod is applied to them. Hence it follows, that
   those who have often been chastised of God, and yet are not thereby
   brought to repentance and amendment, are utterly to be despaired of.
   Such was the obstinacy of the Israelites here described. They could not
   be reformed by any of the afflictions which were sent upon them. It was
   a dreadful manifestation of the vengeance of God to see so many bodies
   of strong and vigorous men stretched dead on the ground. It was
   therefore a proof of monstrous obduracy, when they were not moved at
   such an appalling spectacle. By the expression wondrous works, is not
   only meant the plague just now spoken of: the other miracles,
   previously mentioned, are comprehended. There is, therefore, laid to
   the charge of the people a twofold wickedness; -- they are accused not
   only of disbelieving the word of God, but also of despising the
   miracles which he wrought. For this reason, it is added, that their
   plagues were increased; even as God denounces and threatens by Moses,
   that he will deal sevenfold more severely with the obstinate and
   hardened who persevere in their wickedness.

   33. And he consumed their days in vanity. As the Psalmist here speaks
   of the whole people, as if he had said, that all without exception were
   speedily consumed, from the least even to the greatest, this might with
   probability be referred to that most grievous punishment which was
   confirmed and ratified by the wrath of God -- that they should all
   perish in the wilderness with only two exceptions, Joshua and Caleb;
   because, when already near the land of Canaan, they had turned back.
   That vast multitude, therefore, after they had shut against themselves
   the door of entrance into the Holy Land, died in the wilderness during
   the course of forty years. Days are put in the first place, and then
   years; by which it is intimated, that the duration of their life was
   cut short by the curse of God, and that it was quite apparent that they
   failed in the midst of their course. Their days then were consumed in
   vanity; for they vanished away like smoke: and their years in haste,
   because they passed swiftly away like a stream. The word vhlh, behalah,
   here translated haste, is by some rendered terror. I would rather
   prefer reading tumult; for it is undoubtedly meant that their life was
   taken away, as when in a tumult any thing is taken by force. [338] But
   I would not be disposed to change the word haste, which brings out the
   meaning more perspicuously. It was a display of righteous retribution,
   on account of their obstinacy, that their strength which made them
   proud, thus withered and vanished all on a sudden as a shadow.

   34. When he slew them, then they sought him. By the circumstance here
   recorded, it is intended to aggravate their guilt. When under a
   conviction of their wickedness they acknowledged that they were justly
   punished, and yet did not with sincerity of heart humble themselves
   before God, but rather mocked him, intending to put him off with false
   pretences, their impiety was the less excusable. If a man who has lost
   his judgment does not feel his own calamities, he is excusable because
   he is insensible; but he who is forced to acknowledge that he is
   culpable, and yet always continues the same, or after having lightly
   sought pardon, in fair but deceitful words, suddenly returns to his
   former state of mind, manifestly shows by such hollowness of heart that
   his disease is incurable. It is here tacitly intimated, that the
   punishments, by which a people so obstinate were constrained to seek
   God, were of no common or ordinary kind; and we are informed, (verse
   35, [339] ) not only that they were convinced of wickedness, but also
   that they were affected with a sense and a remembrance of the
   redemption from which they were fallen. By this means they are the more
   effectually deprived of all excuse on the ground of ignorance. The
   language implies that they were not carried away inadvertently, or
   deceived through ignorance, but that they had provoked the wrath of
   God, by dealing treacherously, as it were with deliberate purpose. And,
   indeed, God opened their eyes with the view of more openly discovering
   their desperate wickedness, as if, shaking off their hypocrisy and
   flatteries, he drew them from their lurking-places into the light.

   36. And they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their
   tongue. Here they are charged with perfidiousness, because they neither
   confessed their guilt with sincerity of heart, nor truly ascribed to
   God the glory of their deliverance. We are not to suppose that they
   made no acknowledgement at all; but it is intimated that the confession
   of the mouth, as it did not proceed from the heart, was constrained and
   not voluntary. This is well worthy of being noticed; for from it we
   learn, not only the duty incumbent upon us of guarding against that
   gross hypocrisy which consists in uttering with the tongue, before men,
   one thing, while we think a different thing in our hearts, but also
   that we ought to beware of a species of hypocrisy which is more hidden,
   and which consists in this, that the sinner, being constrained by fear,
   flatters God in a slavish manner, while yet, if he could, he would shun
   the judgment of God. The greater part of men are mortally smitten with
   this disease; for although the divine majesty extorts from them some
   kind of awe, yet it would be gratifying to them were the light of
   divine truth completely extinguished. It is, therefore, not enough to
   yield an assent to the divine word, unless that assent is accompanied
   with true and pure affection, so that our hearts may not be double or
   divided. The Psalmist points out the cause and source of this
   dissimulation to be, that they were not steadfast and faithful By this
   he intimates, that whatever does not proceed from unfeigned purity of
   heart is accounted lying and deceit in the sight of God. Since this
   uprightness is every where required in the law, he accuses the people
   with being covenant-breakers, because they had not kept the covenant of
   God with that fidelity which became them. As I have observed elsewhere,
   there is always to be presupposed a mutual relation and correspondence
   between the covenant of God and our faith, in order that the unfeigned
   consent of the latter may answer to the faithfulness of the former.

   Psalm 78:38-41

   38. Yet he, being merciful, expiated their iniquity, [340] and did not
   destroy them: and he multiplied to turn away his anger, and did not
   stir up all his wrath. 39. And he remembered that they were flesh; a
   spirit [341] that passeth, and returneth not. 40. How often did they
   provoke him in the desert, and grieve him in the wilderness! 41. And
   they returned, and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.


   38. Yet he, being merciful, expiated their iniquity. To show the more
   fully that no means had succeeded in bending the Israelites, and
   causing them to return to a sound state of mind, we are now informed
   that, although God bare with their multiplied transgressions, and
   exercised his mercy in forgiving them, they had no less manifested
   their wickedness in abusing his benignity in every instance in which it
   was displayed, than they had shown themselves refractory and obstinate
   when he treated them with severity. At the same time, the reason is
   assigned why they did not utterly perish. They no doubt deserved to be
   involved in one common destruction; but it is declared that God
   mitigated his anger, that some seed of them might remain. That none
   might infer, from these examples of vengeance which have been
   mentioned, that God had proceeded to punish them with undue severity,
   we are told that the punishments inflicted upon them were moderate --
   yea, mild, when compared with the aggravated nature of their
   wickedness. God kept back his hand, not looking so much to what they
   had deserved, as desiring to give place to his mercy. We are not,
   however, to imagine that he is changeable, when at one time he
   chastises us with a degree of severity, and at another time gently
   draws and allures us to himself; for in the exercise of his matchless
   wisdom, he has recourse to different means by which to try whether
   there is really any hope of our recovery. But the guilt of men becomes
   more aggravated, when neither his severity can reform them nor his
   mercy melt them. It is to be observed, that the mercy of God, which is
   an essential attribute of his nature, is here assigned as the reason
   why he spared his people, to teach us that he was not induced by any
   other cause but this, to show himself so much inclined and ready to
   pardon. Moreover, as he pardoned them not only in one instance, nor in
   one respect, it is affirmed that he expiated their iniquity, that he
   might not destroy them; and again, that although he had been oftentimes
   provoked, he yet ceased not to turn away his anger; and, finally, that
   he mitigated his chastisements, lest the people should be overwhelmed
   with the weight of them.

   39. And he remembered that they were flesh. Another reason is now
   brought forward why God had compassion on the people, which is, his
   unwillingness to try his strength against men who are so constituted as
   to live only for a short period in this world, and who then quickly
   pass away; for the forms of expression here used denote the frailty by
   which the condition of men is made miserable. Flesh and spirit are
   frequently contrasted in the Scriptures; not only when flesh means our
   depraved and sinful nature, and spirit the uprightness to which the
   children of God are born again; but also when men are called flesh,
   because there is nothing firm or stable in them: as it is said in
   Isaiah, (Isaiah 31:3,) "Egypt is flesh, and not spirit." In this
   passage, however, the words flesh and spirit are employed in the same
   sense -- flesh meaning that men are subject to corruption and
   putrefaction; and spirit, that they are only a breath or a fleeting
   shadow. As men are brought to death by a continual wasting and decay,
   the people are compared to a wind which passes away, and which, of its
   own accord, falls and does not return again. When we have run our race,
   we do not commence a new life upon the earth; even as it is said in
   Job,

   "For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
   again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the
   root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the
   ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
   boughs like a plant. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up
   the ghost, and where is he?" (Job 14:7)

   The meaning, then, as we may now clearly perceive, is, that God, in the
   exercise of his mercy and goodness, bare with the Jews, not because
   they deserved this, but because their frail and transitory condition
   called forth his pity and induced him to pardon them. We shall
   afterwards meet with an almost similar statement in Psalm 103:13-16,
   where God is represented as being merciful to us, because he sees that
   we are like grass, and that we soon wither and become dry like hay.
   Now, if God find in us nothing but misery to move him to compassion, it
   follows that it is solely his own pure and undeserved goodness which
   induces him to sustain us. When it is affirmed that men return not,
   when they have finished the course of their life in this world, it is
   not meant to exclude the hope of a future resurrection; for men are
   contemplated only as they are in themselves, and it is merely their
   state on earth which is spoken of. With respect to the renovation of
   man to the heavenly life, it is a miracle far surpassing nature. In the
   same sense it is said, in another place, "His spirit goeth forth, and
   returneth not," (Wisdom 16:14;) language which implies that men, when
   they are born into the world, do not bring with them the hope of future
   restoration, which must be derived from the grace of regeneration.

   40. How often did they provoke him in the desert? Here the preceding
   sentence is confirmed, it being declared that, as they had in so many
   instances provoked God in the wilderness, by the vast accumulation of
   their sins, [342] they must of necessity have perished a thousand
   times, had not God as often shown himself favorable and merciful
   towards them. The interrogatory form of the sentence expresses more
   significantly that they continued sinning without intermission. The
   word wilderness includes in it the circumstance both of place and of
   time. By this it is intended, first, to reprove their ingratitude, in
   that the memory of God's benefits, while still so fresh in their minds,
   and even the sight of them daily before their eyes, were not at least
   able to check them in their wickedness; and, secondly, to condemn their
   impetuous and infatuated recklessness, in heaping up such a multitude
   of sins within so short a period.

   In the same sense it is added immediately after, (verse 41,) that they
   returned to their former ways, and tempted God. The word return does
   not here signify change, but a continued course of sinning. The heinous
   indignity which is done to God when men tempt him, is expressed by a
   beautiful metaphor. The Hebrew word tvh, tavah, signifies to mark out
   or describe. It is intimated, that when the people dared to limit the
   operations of God, according to their own pleasure, he was, as it were,
   shut up within bars of wood or iron, and his infinite power
   circumscribed within the narrow boundaries to which unbelief would
   confine it. And assuredly, whenever men do not go beyond their own
   understandings, it is as if they would measure God by their own small
   capacity, which is nothing else than to pull him down from his throne;
   for his Majesty must be brought into subjection to us, if we would have
   him to be regulated according to our own fancy.

   Psalm 78:42-51

   42. They remembered not his hand in the day that he delivered them from
   the oppressor: [343] 43. When he set his signs in Egypt, and his
   miracles in the field of Zoan. 44. When he turned their rivers into
   blood; and their streams, that they could not drink. 45. He sent among
   them a mixture [344] which devoured them; and the frog which destroyed
   them. 46. And he gave their fruit [or produce] to the caterpillar,
   [345] and their labor to the grasshopper. [346] 47. And he destroyed
   their vines with hail, and their wild fig-trees [347] with hail stones.
   [348] 48. And he gave up their cattle to the hail; and their flocks to
   thunderbolts. 49. He sent upon them the fierceness of his wrath, fury,
   anger, and affliction, and sent evil angels among them. 50. He made a
   way to his anger: he kept not their soul from death, and shut up their
   cattle [349] to the pestilence. 51. And he smote all the first-born in
   Egypt: the first-fruits of their strength [350] in the tents of Ham.


   42. They remembered not his hand. The sacred writer still continues to
   upbraid the Israelites; for the simple remembrance of God's benefits
   might have restrained them, had they not wilfully and perversely
   forgotten whatever they had experienced. From this impious
   forgetfulness proceed waywardness and all rebellion. The hand of God,
   as is well known, is by the figure metonomy taken for his power. In the
   deliverance of the chosen tribes from Egypt here celebrated, the hand
   of God was stretched forth in a new and an unusual manner. And their
   impiety, against which the prophet now inveighs, was rendered the more
   detestable, from the fact that they accounted as nothing, or soon
   forgat, that which no length of time ought to have effaced from their
   memory. Farther, he recounts certain examples of the power of God,
   which he calls first signs, and then miracles, (verse 43,) that, by the
   recital of these, he may again rebuke the shameful stupidity of the
   people. By both these words he expresses the same thing; but in the
   second clause of the verse, the word miracles gives additional
   emphasis, implying that, by such strange and unheard-of events, the
   Egyptians had at that time been stricken with such terror as ought not
   to have vanished so speedily from the minds of the Israelites.

   44. When he turned their rivers into blood. The Psalmist does not
   enumerate in their order the miracles by which God gave evidence of his
   power in the deliverance of his people. He considered it enough to
   bring to their remembrance the well-known histories of these events,
   which would be sufficient to lay open the wickedness and ingratitude
   with which they were chargeable; nor is it necessary for us to stay
   long on these things, since the narrative of Moses gives a more
   distinct and fuller account of what is here briefly stated. Only I
   would have my readers to remember that, although God often punished the
   sins of the heathen by sending upon them hail and other calamities, yet
   all the plagues which at that time were inflicted upon the Egyptians
   were of an extraordinary character, and such as were previously
   unheard-of. A variety of words is therefore employed to enhance these
   memorable instances of the vengeance of God, as that he sent upon them
   the fierceness of his wrath, fury, anger, and affliction This
   accumulation of words is intended to awaken minds which are asleep to a
   discovery of so many miracles, of which both the number and the
   excellence might be perceived even by the blind themselves.

   In the last place, it is added that God executed these judgments by
   angels. Although God has, according as it has pleased him, established
   certain laws, both in heaven and on earth, and governs the whole order
   of nature in such a manner as that each creature has assigned to it its
   own peculiar office; yet whenever it seems good to him he makes use of
   the ministration of angels for executing his commands, not by ordinary
   or natural means, but by his secret power, which to us is
   incomprehensible. Some think that devils are here spoken of, because
   the epithet evil or hurtful is applied to angel. [351] This opinion I
   do not reject; but the ground upon which they rest it has little
   solidity. They say that as God dispenses his benefits to us by the
   ministry of elect angels, so he also executes his wrath by the agency
   of reprobate angels, as if they were his executioners. This I admit is
   partly true; but I deny that this distinction is always observed. Many
   passages of Scripture can be quoted to the contrary. When the army of
   the Assyrians laid siege to the holy city Jerusalem, who was it that
   made such havoc among them as compelled them to raise the siege, but
   the angel who was appointed at that time for the defense of the Church?
   (2 Kings 19:35.) In like manner, the angel who slew the first-born in
   Egypt (Exodus 11:5) was not only a minister and an executor of the
   wrath of God against the Egyptians, but also the agent employed for
   preserving the Israelites. On the other hand, although the kings of
   whom Daniel speaks were avaricious and cruel, or rather robbers, and
   turned all things upside down, yet the Prophet declares, (chapter
   20:13,) that holy angels were appointed to take charge of them. It is
   probable that the Egyptians were given over and subjected to reprobate
   angels, as they deserved; but we may simply consider the angels here
   spoken of as termed evil, on account of the work in which they were
   employed, -- because they inflicted upon the enemies of the people of
   God terrible plagues to repress their tyranny and cruelty. In this way,
   both the heavenly and elect angels, and the fallen angels, are justly
   accounted the ministers or executors of calamity; but they are to be
   regarded as such in different senses. The former yield a prompt and
   willing obedience to God; but the latter, as they are always eagerly
   intent upon doing mischief, and would, if they could, turn the whole
   world upside down, are fit instruments for inflicting calamities upon
   men.

   50. He made a way to his anger. [352] To take away all excuse from this
   ungrateful people, whom the most evident and striking proofs of the
   goodness of God which were presented before their eyes could not keep
   in their obedience to him, it is here again repeated that the wrath of
   God overflowed Egypt like an impetuous torrent. The miracle adverted to
   is the last which was there wrought, when God, by the powerful hand of
   his angel, slew, in one night, all the first-born of Egypt. According
   to a common and familiar mode of speaking in the Hebrew language, the
   first-born are called the beginning, or the first-fruits of strength.
   Although the old advance to death as they decline in years, yet as they
   are in a manner renewed in their offspring, and thus may be said to
   recover their decayed strength, the term strength is applied to their
   children. And the first-born are called the beginning or the
   first-fruits of this strength, as I have explained more at large on
   [13]Genesis 49:3. The houses of Egypt are called the tents of Ham,
   because Misraim, who gave the name to the country, was the son of Ham,
   Genesis 10:6. Farther, there is here celebrated the free love of God
   towards the posterity of Shem, as manifested in his preferring them to
   all the children of Ham, although they were possessed of no intrinsic
   excellence which might render them worthy of such a distinction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [343] That is, Pharaoh, as the next verse shows. See Psalm 107:2.

   [344] This is the literal rendering of the original word rv, arob,
   which is derived from the verb rv, arab, he mingled It is not agreed
   among interpreters what is meant by this name given here, and in Exodus
   8:21, and in Psalm 105:31, to one of the plagues which fell upon the
   Egyptians. The Chaldee has "a mixture of living creatures of the wood."
   "A mixture; a mixed collection of beasts," says Bythner. In our English
   Bible, it is "divers sorts of flies." Others read, "swarms of flies."
   Bishop Mant reads, "the ravening fly;" Fry, simply "the fly;" and
   Walford, "the horse-fly." "The Seventy," says Mant, "have rendered the
   original word translated fly,' when spoken of the Egyptian plague,
   constantly by kunomuia, the dog-fly;' whence it is plain those
   translators thought it meant some particular species of fly, in
   opposition to those who are of opinion that it meant all sorts of
   flies.' (See Parkhurst on rv.) What particular species was intended has
   been much doubted. Bruce, however, seems to have decided the question,
   and fixed the insect to be the Ethiopian fly, called Zimb, of which he
   has given a particular description. Some of its effects are thus
   represented by him. As soon as this plague appears, and their buzzing
   is heard, all the cattle forsake their food, and run wildly about the
   plain, till they die, worn out with fatigue, fright, and hunger. No
   remedy remains but to leave the black earth, and hasten down to the
   sands of Atbara; and there they remain, while the rains last, this
   cruel enemy not daring to pursue them further. Though his size be
   immense, as is his strength, and his body covered with a thick skin,
   defended with strong hair, yet even the camel is not capable of
   sustaining the violent punctures the fly makes with his pointed
   proboscis. When once attacked by this fly, his body, head, and legs,
   break out into large bosses, which swell, break, and putrefy, to the
   certain destruction of the creature. Even the elephant and rhinoceros,
   which, by reason of their enormous bulk, and the vast quantity of food
   and water they daily need, cannot shift to desert and dry places, as
   the season may require, are obliged to roll themselves in mud and mire;
   which, when dry, coats them over like armor, and enables them to stand
   their ground against this winged assassin.'" -- Mant

   [345] chsyl, chasil, which is derived from chsl, chasal, to consume,
   eat up, denotes a species of insect, so called from its devouring the
   fruits of the earth. But we are so little acquainted with the various
   kinds of destructive insects that ravage the Eastern countries, that it
   is somewhat difficult to determine the particular species meant by this
   term. It is distinguished from the locust in Solomon's prayer at the
   dedication of the temple, 2 Chronicles 6:28, and in Joel 1:4, where it
   is mentioned as eating up what the locusts had left. Harmer is of
   opinion that it is the species of insects now called sim in Persia,
   referred to in the following extract from Sir John Chardin's Travels:
   -- "Persia is subject to have its harvests spoiled by hail, by drought,
   or by insects, either locusts or small insects which they call sim,
   which are small white lice, which fix themselves on the foot of the
   stalk of corn, gnaw it, and make it die. It is rare for a year to be
   exempt from one or other of these scourges, which affect the ploughed
   lands and the gardens," etc. On this Harmer observes, "The enumeration
   by Solomon and that of this modern writer, though not exactly alike,
   yet so nearly resemble each other, that one would be inclined to
   believe these small insects are what Solomon meant by the word [chsyl,
   chasil] translated caterpillars' in our English version." -- Harmer's
   Observations, volume 3, page 316. chsyl, chasil, is rendered brouchos
   by the LXX., in 2 Chronicles 6:28, and by Aquila here, and also by the
   Vulgate in Chronicles and in Isaiah 33:4, and it is rendered by Jerome
   here, bruchus, "the chaffer," which every one knows to be a great
   devourer of the leaves of trees. The Syriac in Joel 1:4, 2:25, renders
   it, tsrtsvr', tzartzooro, which Michaelis, (Supplem. ad Lex. Heb., page
   865,) from the Arabic tsrtsr, tsartzar, a cricket, interprets the
   mole-cricket, which, in its grub state, is also very destructive to
   corn, grass, and other vegetables, by cankering the roots on which it
   feeds. -- See Parkhurst's Lexicon on ch'l

   [346] The Hebrew word here translated "grasshopper" is, 'rvh, arbeh,
   which properly means "locust." The locust receives no fewer than ten
   different names in Scripture, each of which indicates something
   characteristic. It is called 'rvh, arbeh, from its extraordinary
   fecundity. No animal is more prolific; nor has Providence ever employed
   an agency more effective in destroying the fruits of the earth. Dr
   Russell, in his Natural History of Aleppo, observes that locusts
   "sometimes arrive in such incredible multitudes as it would appear
   fabulous to relate, destroying the whole of the verdure wherever they
   pass." A Traveller in Syria says, "That country, together with Egypt,
   Persia, and almost all the whole middle part of Asia, partakes in
   another scourge besides volcanoes and earthquakes, and that no less
   terrible; I mean those clouds of locusts of which travelers have
   spoken: the quantity of these insects is incredible to any man who has
   not seen it: the earth is covered by them for several leagues round.
   One may hear at a distance the noise they make in brousing the plants
   and trees, like an army plundering in secret. It would be better to be
   concerned with Tartars than these little destructive animals: one might
   say that fire follows their tract." -- See Parkhurst's Lexicon on
   rvh,4.

   [347] The original word sqmvtm, shikmotham, does not properly signify
   the fig-tree, but the sycamore, a tree which grows in Palestine,
   Arabia, and Egypt. It is different from the English sycamore, which is
   a species of maple. It bears fruit resembling the fig, whilst its
   leaves are like those of the mulberry-tree; whence its name, sukos,
   (sycos,) a fig-tree, and, moros, (moros,) a mulberry-tree. The sycamore
   was highly valued by the ancient Egyptians. It furnished them with wood
   for various purposes; it afforded a grateful shade by its
   wide-spreading branches; and the figs which it produced, it is not
   improbable, formed a principal part of the food of the common people.
   "Norden tells us the people for the greater part live upon these figs;
   thinking themselves well regaled when they have a piece of bread, a
   couple of sycamore-figs, and a pitcher filled with water from the
   Nile." -- Harmer's Observations, volume 4, pages 4, 5. From this it is
   easy to conceive how severe and distressing the loss must have been
   which the Egyptians sustained "when their vines were destroyed with
   hail, and their sycamore-trees with frost or hailstones."

   [348] "vchnml, ba-chana-mal, in frost A noun of four letters prefixed
   with v; chnml is read here only in Scripture. And what it may be is
   unknown. Severe frost, according to some; a kind of hail, according to
   others." -- Bythner

   [349] The original word chytm, chayatham, here rendered their cattle,
   is translated in our English Bible their life But in all the ancient
   versions it is their cattle The reference is to the plague which
   destroyed all the first-born in the land of Egypt. The first-born both
   of cattle, and of the Egyptians themselves, were involved in one common
   destruction. Exodus 12:29

   [350] "Ar. reads, vnyhm, the first-fruits of their children.' See
   Exodus 12:29." -- Dimock

   [351] Aben Ezra supposes ml'ky rym, malachey raim, to be Moses and
   Aaron, as messengers of evil to Pharaoh, who are so called because they
   previously warned him, and denounced the judgments of God against him,
   just as the Prophet Abijah makes use of a similar expression when the
   wife of Jeroboam came to him to inquire concerning her son: "I am a
   messenger to thee of hard things," 1 Kings 14:6. Fry also reads
   "messengers of evil," and has the following note: "Such is the literal
   meaning and exact rendering of ml'ky rym, and not evil angels, which
   would be regularly ml'kym rym. By these messengers of evil, I make no
   doubt, no more is meant than Moses and Aaron, who were charged with
   denunciations of wrath to Pharaoh, previously to the infliction of all
   the several plagues." Archbishop Secker, however, observes, that
   although ml'kym rym would be the proper expression for evil angels, yet
   the plural of l'k is sometimes written defectively ml'ky. The LXX. has,
   apostolon di angelon poneron, "a message by evil angels."

   [352] "He levelled a path to his anger phls [the word for levelled]
   signifies to direct by a line or level; and when applied to a way, is
   understood to denote that the way is made straight and smooth, so as to
   leave no impediment to the passenger. See Poole's Synopsis and Le
   Clerc. The sense will be much the same whether we thus interpret the
   phrase, or suppose the anger of God to have taken its direction, para
   stathmen, in a straight line, and by a level; that is, in the shortest
   way, without delay or deviation." -- Merrick's Annotations

   Psalm 78:52-58

   52. And he made his people to go forth like sheep, and led them in the
   wilderness like a flock. 53. And he conducted them in safety, and they
   were not afraid: and the sea covered their enemies. 54. And he brought
   them to his holy border, [literally to the border of his holiness,]
   this mountain, [353] which his right hand acquired. [354] 55. He
   expelled the heathen from before them; and made them to fall into their
   part of the inheritance; [355] and made the children of Israel to dwell
   in their tents. 56. And they tempted and provoked the Most High God,
   and kept not his testimonies. 57. And they turned back and dealt
   treacherously, like their fathers: they turned back, like a deceitful
   bow. [356] 58. And they provoked him to anger with their high places;
   and moved him to anger with their graven images.


   52. And he made his people to go forth like sheep. The Psalmist again
   celebrates God's fatherly love towards the chosen people, whom, as we
   have elsewhere remarked, he compares to a flock of sheep. They had no
   wisdom or power of their own to preserve and defend themselves; but God
   graciously condescended to perform towards them the office of a
   shepherd. It is a singular token of the love which he bore towards
   them, that he did not disdain to humble himself so far as to feed them
   as his own sheep. What could a multitude who had never been trained up
   to the art of war do against powerful and warlike enemies? So far from
   having learned the art of war, the people, as is well known, had been
   employed, when in Egypt, in mean and servile occupations, as if they
   had been condemned to toil under the earth in mines or in quarries.

   53. And he conducted them in safety, and they were not afraid. This
   does not imply that they relied on God confidently, and with tranquil
   minds, but that, having God for their guide and the guardian of their
   welfare, they had no just cause to be afraid. When at any time they
   were thrown into consternation, this was owing to their own unbelief.
   From this cause proceeded these murmuring questions to which they gave
   utterance, when Pharaoh pursued them, upon their leaving Egypt, and
   when they were "sore afraid:" "Because there were no graves in Egypt,
   hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
   dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the
   word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may
   serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the
   Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness," (Exodus 14:11.)
   This security, then, is not to be referred to the feeling of this in
   the minds of the people, but to the protection of God, by which it came
   to pass that, their enemies having been drowned in the Red Sea, they
   enjoyed quiet and repose in the wilderness. Other benefits which God
   had bestowed upon them are here recited, and at the same time other
   transgressions with which they had been chargeable. This shows the more
   clearly their deep ingratitude. After having obtained possession of the
   inheritance which was promised them, as if they had been under no
   obligations to God, their hearts were always rebellious and
   untractable. The accomplishment, and, as it were, the concluding act of
   their deliverance, was the putting them in possession of the land of
   Canaan, from entering which they had precluded themselves, had not God
   determined, notwithstanding their wickedness, to complete, in all
   respects, the work which he had commenced. The land itself is called
   the borders of God's sanctuary, (verse 54,) because God, in assigning
   it to his people, had also consecrated it to himself. This, it is
   manifest, exhibits in a more heinous and aggravated light the iniquity
   of the people, who brought into that land the same pollutions with
   which it had been anciently defiled. What madness was it for the people
   of Israel, who knew that the old inhabitants of the country had been
   driven from it on account of their abominations, to strive to surpass
   them in all kinds of wickedness? as if they had been resolved to do all
   they could to bring down upon their own heads that divine vengeance
   which they had seen executed upon others. The words this mountain are
   improperly explained by some as applying to the whole country of Judea;
   for although it was a mountainous country, there were in it plain and
   level grounds of large extent, both as to breadth and length. I have,
   therefore, no doubt, that by way of amplification the Psalmist makes
   honorable mention of mount Zion, where God had chosen a habitation for
   himself, and his chief seat. I indeed allow, that under this
   expression, by the figure synecdoche, a part is put for the whole; only
   I would have my readers to understand, that this place is expressly
   named, because from it, as from a source or fountain, flowed the
   holiness of the whole land. It is asserted that God, by his right hand,
   possessed or acquired this mountain; for the Hebrew verb qnh, kanah,
   may be understood in either of these senses: and this assertion is
   made, that the Israelites might not be lifted up with pride, as if they
   had achieved the conquest of the land, or had obtained the peaceable
   possession of it by their own power. As is stated in Psalm 44:3,

   "They got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did
   their own arm save them, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the
   light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favor unto them." (Psalm
   44:3)

   55. He expelled the heathen from before them; and made them to fall
   into their part of the inheritance. These words are an explanation of
   the concluding sentence of the preceding verse: they describe the
   manner in which the land of Canaan was acquired, plainly intimating
   that the Israelites were not such a warlike race, nor those heathen
   nations so cowardly, as to render it an easy matter for the former to
   vanquish the latter, and that it would have been impossible for the
   former to have expelled the latter from the country, had they not been
   led on to victory under the conduct of God, and been aided by his
   power. Besides, it would have been unlawful for them to have taken
   possession of the country, had it not been the will of God that the
   first inhabitants should be deprived of it, and that strangers should
   be established in it in their room.

   56. And they tempted and provoked the Most High God. Here they are
   upbraided for having, notwithstanding the many tokens of the divine
   favor by which they were distinguished, persevered in acting
   perfidiously: yea, even although God from time to time conferred upon
   them new benefits, to recover them to their allegiance to him, they,
   notwithstanding, by their rebellion, shook off his yoke. With respect
   to the word tempt, we have already explained its import. But it is
   added in general, that they provoked God, because they had not kept his
   covenant By this last clause, their open and gross rebellion is the
   more completely demonstrated; for, although they had been plainly
   taught their duty, they nevertheless refused to submit to the authority
   of God. The law is called testimonies or agreements, [357] because, as
   men enter into contracts upon certain conditions, so God, by his
   covenant, entered into a contract with this people, and bound them to
   himself. In speaking of them in this manner, there is pronounced upon
   them no light censure; but when they are charged in the next verse with
   apostasy and perfidiousness, that fills up the measure of their guilt.
   God had adopted them to be his people: they, on the other hand,
   despising his favor, voluntarily renounce it. He had gathered them
   together under his wings; and they, by their waywardness, scatter
   themselves in all directions. He had promised to be a father to them;
   and they refuse to be his children. He had shown them the way of
   salvation; and they, by going astray, willingly precipitate themselves
   into destruction. The prophet, therefore, concludes, that in every age
   they showed themselves to be an impious and wicked people. It is again
   to be noticed, that the fault which is most severely condemned in them
   is, that they too much resembled their fathers. This is particularly
   mentioned, to prevent any man from deceiving himself by supposing, that
   in indiscriminately imitating his ancestors he is doing right, and that
   he may not think of making use of their example as an argument for
   defending his own conduct. The instability of the people is next
   expressed by a very apposite figure, which Hosea also employs in Hosea
   7:16. As archers are deceived when they have a bow which is too weak,
   or ill bent, or crooked and flexible, so it is stated, that this people
   turned back, and slipped away by their deceitful and tortuous
   craftiness, that they might not be governed by the hand of God.

   58. And they provoked him to anger with their high places. We have here
   adduced the species of defection by which the Israelites afforded
   incontestable evidence that they refused to be faithful to God, and to
   yield allegiance to him. They had been sufficiently, and more than
   sufficiently warned, that the service of God would be perverted and
   contaminated, unless they were regulated in every part of it by the
   Divine Word; and now, disregarding his whole law, they recklessly
   follow their own inventions. And the fruits which uniformly proceed
   from the contempt of the law are, that men who choose rather to follow
   their own understanding than to submit to the authority of God, become
   wedded to gross superstitions. The Psalmist complains that the service
   of God was corrupted by them in two ways; in the first place, by their
   defacing the glory of God, in setting up for themselves idols and
   graven images; and, secondly, by their inventing strange and forbidden
   ceremonies to appease the anger of God.

   Psalm 78:59-66

   59. God heard it, and was wroth, and exceedingly abhorred Israel. 60.
   And he forsook the habitation of Shiloh, [358] the tabernacle where he
   dwelt among men. 61. And he delivered his strength into captivity, and
   his beauty into the hand of the enemy. 62. And he shut up his people to
   the sword, and was wroth with his own inheritance. 63. The fire
   devoured their chosen; [359] , and their virgins were not applauded.
   [360] 64. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
   lamentation. 65. But the Lord awoke as one asleep, as a mighty man that
   crieth out by reason of wine. 66. And he smote his enemies behind; he
   put upon them everlasting disgrace.


   59 God heard it, and was wroth. The prophet again shows that God, when
   he found that no good resulted from his long-suffering, which the
   people abused, yea, even treated with mockery, and perverted as an
   encouragement to greater excess in sinning, at length proceeded to
   inflict severe punishments upon them. The metaphor, which he borrows
   from earthly judges, is frequently to be met with in the Scriptures.
   When God is said to hear, it is not meant that it is necessary for him
   to make inquisition, but it is intended to teach us that he does not
   rush forth inconsiderately to execute his judgments, and thus to
   prevent any from supposing that he ever acts precipitately. The amount
   of what is stated is, that the people continued so pertinaciously in
   their wickedness, that at length the cry of it ascended to heaven; and
   the very weight of the punishment demonstrated the aggravated nature of
   the offense.

   After it is said that Israel, whom God had loved so much, was become an
   abomination in his sight, it is added, (verse 60,) that they were
   bereft of the presence of God, which is the only source of true
   felicity and comfort under calamities of every kind. God, then, is said
   to have abhorred Israel, when he permitted the ark of the covenant to
   be carried into another country, as if he intended by this to indicate
   that he had departed from Judea, and bidden the people farewell. It is
   indeed very obvious, that God was not fixed to the outward and visible
   symbol; but as he had given the ark to be a token or sign of the close
   union which subsisted between him and the Israelites, in suffering it
   to be carried away, he testified, that he himself had also departed
   from them. Shiloh having been for a long time the abode of the ark, and
   the place where it was captured by the Philistines, (1 Samuel 4:11,) it
   is termed the habitation or dwelling-place of God. The manner of his
   residence, in short, is beautifully expressed in the next sentence,
   where Shiloh is described as his dwelling-place among men. God, it is
   true, fills both heaven and earth; but as we cannot attain to that
   infinite height to which he is exalted, in descending among us by the
   exercise of his power and grace, he approaches as near to us as is
   needful, and as our limited capacity will bear. It is a very emphatic
   manner of speaking to represent God as so incensed by the continual
   wickedness of his people, that he was constrained to forsake this
   place, the only one which he had chosen for himself upon the earth.

   61. And he delivered his strength into captivity. In this verse, the
   same subject is prosecuted: it is declared, that the strength of God,
   by which the Israelites had been shielded and defended, was at that
   time in captivity. Not that his power could only be exerted in
   connection with the outward symbol; but instead of opposing their
   enemies as he had formerly done, it was now his will that the grace by
   which he had preserved his people should, so to speak, be led captive.
   This, however, is not to be understood as implying that the Philistines
   had made God their prisoner. The meaning simply is, that the Israelites
   were deprived of the protection of God, in consequence of which they
   fell into the hands of their enemies, even as an army is put to flight
   when the general is taken prisoner. The ark is also termed the beauty
   of God; because, being in himself invisible, he made it the symbol of
   his presence, or, as it were, a mirror in which he might be seen. It is
   a bold, and at first sight, an absurd hyperbole, to say that the
   strength of God was taken prisoner by the Philistines; but it is
   expressly used for the purpose of aggravating the wickedness of the
   people. As he had been accustomed mightily to display the power of his
   arm in aiding them, the offenses with which he had been provoked must
   have been of a very heinous character, when he suffered that symbol of
   his power to be forcibly carried away by a heathen army. We are taught
   by the prophet Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 7:12,) that what is here related of
   Shiloh, is addressed as a warning to all those who, flattering
   themselves upon false grounds, that they enjoy the presence of God, are
   lifted up with vain confidence: "But go ye now unto my place which was
   in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it
   for the wickedness of my people Israel." If, therefore, when God
   approaches us familiarly, we do not sincerely receive him with that
   reverence which becomes us, we have ground to fear that what happened
   to the people of Shiloh will happen also to us. So much the more
   disgusting, then, is the boasting of the Pope and his adherents, who
   support the claims of Rome as the special dwelling-place of God, from
   the fact, that the Church in former times flourished in that city. It
   is to be remembered, -- what they seem to forget, -- that Christ, who
   is the true temple of the Godhead, was born in Bethlehem, and brought
   up in Nazareth, and that he dwelt and preached in Capernaum and
   Jerusalem; and yet the miserable desolation of all these cities affords
   a dreadful testimony of the wrath of God.

   62. And he shut up his people to the sword. Other parts of the calamity
   which befell Israel in the time of the high priest Eli are here
   mentioned. God, in permitting the ark to be carried away, showed that
   he had withdrawn his favor from them. This was also demonstrated from
   the fact, that all the flower of the people -- those who were in the
   prime and blush of manhood -- were consumed by the wrath of God: which
   is expressed by the fire devouring them. But this language is
   metaphorical, as is evident from the history of the event referred to,
   which informs us, that those that perished who were of the chosen of
   Israel, to the number of thirty thousand men, fell by the sword of the
   enemy, and not by fire, (1 Samuel 4:10.) This figure points out the
   suddenness of the dreadful calamity. It is as if it had been said, They
   were destroyed in a moment, even as fire quickly consumes chaff and the
   dry leaves of trees. [361]

   The great extent of this slaughter is heightened by another figure,
   which is, that for want of men, the maidens continued unmarried. This
   is the meaning of the clause, Their virgins were not applauded; the
   reference being to the nuptial songs which were wont to be sung at
   marriages in praise of the bride. To aggravate still more the unwonted
   and appalling nature of the calamity, it is added, that even the
   priests, whom God had taken under his special protection, perished
   indiscriminately with others. When it is said, that the widows made no
   lamentation, I would explain it as denoting, either that they
   themselves died first for sorrow, so that they had no opportunity of
   mourning for others, or else, that when led captive by their enemies,
   they were prohibited to mourn. By all these expressions, the object is
   to show, in a few words, that all kinds of calamities were heaped upon
   them. [362]

   65. But the Lord awoke as one asleep. Some understand this as spoken of
   the Israelites, implying that the Lord awoke against them; and others,
   as spoken of their enemies. If the first sense is adopted, it need not
   excite our surprise, that the Israelites are termed, in the 66th verse,
   the enemies of God, even as they are so designated in Isaiah 1:24,

   "Therefore, saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of
   Israel, Ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine
   enemies." (Isaiah 1:24)

   And thus the meaning will be, that the Israelites paid dearly for
   abusing the patience of God, by taking encouragement from it to indulge
   to greater excess in the commission of sin; for awaking suddenly, he
   rushed upon them with so much the greater fury. But as we find the
   prophets drawing their doctrine from Moses, and also framing their
   language according to his as a standard, the opinion of those who
   understand this and the following verse, as referring to the
   Philistines, is no less probable. The prophet here appears to have
   borrowed this order, from the song of Moses, (Deuteronomy 32:27,) where
   God declares, that while he punished his own people, he, at the same
   time, did not forget to repress their enemies. Since it is a common
   proverb, that the issue of wars is uncertain, if, after the enemies of
   the chosen tribes had obtained the victory, no change had happened to
   them, it would not have been so manifest, that what befell his own
   people was a punishment inflicted upon them by God. But when God, after
   having afflicted and humbled the Israelites, made his judgments to fall
   on their conquerors, without the instrumentality of man, beyond all
   human expectation, and contrary to what happens in the ordinary course
   of events; -- from this it is the more plainly manifest, that when the
   Israelites were laid in the dust, it was the work of God, who intended
   thus to punish them. The prophet, however, at the same time, gives us
   to understand, that God was constrained, as it were, by necessity, to
   punish them with greater severity; because, in afterwards inflicting
   his judgments upon the Philistines, he gave abundant evidence of his
   regard to his covenant, which the Israelites might be very apt to think
   he had quite forgotten. Although he had, so to speak, taken the side of
   the Philistines for a time, it was not his intention utterly to
   withdraw his love from the children of Abraham, lest the truth of his
   promise should become void.

   The figure of a drunken man may seem somewhat harsh; but the propriety
   of using it will appear, when we consider that it is employed in
   accommodation to the stupidity of the people. Had they been of a pure
   and clear understanding, [363] God would not have thus transformed
   himself, and assumed a character foreign to his own. When he,
   therefore, compares himself to a drunken man, it was the drunkenness of
   the people; that is to say, their insensibility that constrained him to
   speak thus: which was so much the greater shame to them. With respect
   to God, the metaphor derogates nothing from his glory. If he does not
   immediately remedy our calamities, we are ready to think that he is
   sunk into a profound sleep. But how can God, it may be said, be thus
   asleep, when he is superior in strength to all the giants, and yet they
   can easily watch for a long time, and are satisfied with little sleep?
   I answer, when he exercises forbearance, and does not promptly execute
   his judgments, the interpretation which ignorant people put upon his
   conduct is, that he loiters in this manner like a man who is stupified,
   and knows not how to proceed. [364] The prophet, on the contrary,
   declares, that this sudden awaking of God will be more alarming and
   terrible than if he had at the first lifted up his hand to execute
   judgment; and that it will be as if a giant, drunken with wine, should
   start up suddenly out of his sleep, while as yet he had not slept off
   his surfeit. Many restrict the statement in the 66th verse, concerning
   God's smiting his enemies behind, to the plague which he sent upon the
   Philistines, recorded in 1 Samuel 5:12. The phrase, everlasting
   disgrace, agrees very well with this interpretation; for it was a
   shameful disease to be afflicted with haemorrhoids in their hinder
   parts. But as the words, They were smitten behind, admit of a more
   simple sense, I leave the matter undecided.

   Psalm 78:67-72

   67. And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe
   of Ephraim: 68. But he chose the tribe of Judah, the mountain of Zion,
   which he loved: [365] 69. And built his sanctuary like high places, and
   like the earth which he has established for ever. 70. And he chose
   David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: 71. He took him
   froth following the suckling ewes, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel
   his inheritance: 72. And he fed them in the uprightness of his heart,
   and guided them by the prudence of his hands.


   67. And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph. Those who suppose that
   the word enemies, in the 66th verse, applies to the Israelites, connect
   these verses with the preceding, and suppose the meaning to be, that
   the wound which God had inflicted upon them was incurable. But,
   preferring the other opinion, which regards the Philistines as spoken
   of, and the scope to be, that God, in punishing them so severely,
   evidently showed that the covenant which he had made with his people
   was not disannulled, since he had avenged himself in such an awful
   manner upon their enemies, the explanation which I would rather give
   is, that this is added by way of correction, as if it had been said,
   That God was not yet fully reconciled towards his people who had
   wickedly revolted from him, and that, as an evidence of this, there
   remained among them some traces of the punishment with which he had
   visited them. The meaning of the text, therefore, is, that when the ark
   was taken by the Philistines, God was, so to speak, asleep, having been
   made drunk by the sins of his people, so that he could no longer keep
   watch for their defense as he had been accustomed to do; and yet, that
   he did not continue long sunk in sleep, but that, whenever he saw the
   ungodly Philistines treating with mockery the glory of his majesty,
   this heinous insult awoke and provoked him, just as if a giant, having
   well supped, had awoke from his first sleep before he had recovered
   from the exciting effects of his wine; and that, at the same time, his
   anger had not been so provoked against this heathen and uncircumcised
   nation as to prevent him from exhibiting some signs of the chastisement
   which he had inflicted upon the wicked and ungrateful Israelites even
   to the end. The rejection spoken of amounts to this, that when God
   permitted his ark to be carried away to another place, the Israelites
   were thereby deprived of the honor with which, by special privilege,
   they had been previously distinguished.

   There are two principal points which should here be particularly
   attended to; in the first place, when the Philistines were smitten with
   unseemly ulcers, the plainest evidence was afforded that when the
   Israelites were conquered by them, this happened solely because God
   willed it to be so. He did not recover new strength, or gather together
   a new army for the purpose of invading, some short time after, the
   Philistines who had been victorious, nor did he have recourse, in doing
   this, to foreign aid. The other point is, that although God stretched
   forth his hand against the Philistines, to show that he had still some
   remembrance of his covenant, and some care of the people whom he had
   chosen, yet in restoring the Israelites in some measure to their former
   state, he made the rejection of Shiloh a perpetual monument of his
   wrath. He, therefore, rejected the tribe of Ephraim; [366] not that he
   cast them off for ever, or completely severed them from the rest of the
   body of the Church, but he would not have the ark of his covenant to
   reside any longer within the boundaries of that tribe. To the tribe of
   Ephraim is here opposed the tribe of Judah, in which God afterwards
   chose for himself a dwelling-place.

   Thus the prophet proceeds to show, that when the ark of the covenant
   had a resting-place assigned to it on mount Zion, the people were in a
   manner renewed; and this symbol of reconciliation being restored to
   them, they were recovered to the favor of God from which they had
   fallen. As God had, so to speak, been banished from the kingdom, and
   his strength led into captivity through the sins of the Israelites,
   they had need to be taught, by this memorial, that God had been so
   highly displeased with their wickedness, that he could not bear to look
   upon the place in which he had formerly dwelt. After this separation,
   although to teach the people to be more on their guard in time to come,
   there was not a full and perfect restitution, yet God again chose a
   fixed residence for his ark, which was a manifestation of wonderful
   goodness and mercy on his part. The ark, after its return, was carried
   from one place to another, as to Gath, Ekron, and other places, until
   mount Zion was pointed out by an oracle as its fixed abode; but this
   intervening period is not taken notice of by the prophet, because his
   design went no farther than to impress upon the memory, both the
   example of the punishment, and the grace of God, which was greater than
   any could have ventured to hope for. [367] That which is often repeated
   by Moses should also be remembered:

   "But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all
   your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye
   seek, and thither thou shalt come," etc., (Deuteronomy 12:5.)

   Shiloh having acquired this renown, because the ark had dwelt there for
   a long time, when the ark was carried away into the country of the
   enemies of Israel, the minds of men were strangely perplexed, until
   they knew the place which God had chosen for its future residence. The
   ten tribes were not at that time rejected, and they had an equal
   interest in the kingdom and the priesthood with the tribe of Judah; but
   in process of time their own rebellion cut them off. This is the reason
   why the prophet says, in scorn, that the tribe of Ephraim was rejected,
   and that the tribe of Joseph, from whom it sprung, was not chosen.

   68. But he chose the tribe of Judah. The meaning is, that God preferred
   the tribe of Judah to all the rest of the people, and chose from it a
   king, whom he might set over all the Israelites as well as the Jews.
   And he chose the mountain of Zion, appointing a certain spot upon it to
   be the seat of his sanctuary. That the cause of this choice might not
   be sought any where else but in God, it is particularly stated that the
   preferring of mount Zion to all other places, and the enriching of it
   in such a distinguished manner, proceeded entirely from the free and
   unmerited love of God. The relative which is here put instead of the
   causal adverb for; the meaning being, that the sanctuary of God was
   established there, not for any worthiness of the place, but solely
   because it was the good pleasure of God. It was proper that this second
   restitution of the people should be no less free than their first
   adoption was, when God made his covenant with Abraham, or when he
   delivered them from the land of Egypt. God's love to the place had a
   respect to men. From this it follows, that the Church has been gathered
   together from the beginning, and in all ages, by the pure grace and
   goodness of God; for never have men been found to possess any intrinsic
   meritorious claims to his regard, and the Church is too precious to be
   left to depend upon the power of men.

   69. And built his sanctuary like high places. [368] In this verse, what
   is intimated is simply this, that Mount Zion was singularly beautified;
   which, however, ought to be referred to the heavenly pattern. It was
   not the will of God that the minds of his people should be entirely
   engrossed with the magnificence of the building, or with the pomp of
   outward ceremonies; but that they should be elevated to Christ, in whom
   the truth of the figures of the former economy was exhibited. It is,
   therefore affirmed, that the sanctuary was built like high places; that
   is to say, it was conspicuous among all the high mountains: even as
   Isaiah (Isaiah 2:2,) and Micah, (Micah 4:1,) prophesying of the
   building of the new and spiritual temple, declare that it "shall be
   established in the tops of the mountains, and shall be exalted above
   the hills." And it is well known that fortresses were in those days
   erected upon high places. Zion is next compared to the entire mass of
   the globe: He hath built his sanctuary like the earth, [369] which he
   has established for ever. Some regions of the globe are visited by
   earthquakes, or perish by the opening of the earth, or are agitated by
   some violent commotion, or undergo some alteration; but the body of the
   earth itself continues always stable and unchanged, because it rests
   upon deep foundations. It is, therefore, here taught that the building
   spoken of was not temporary, like the sumptuous palaces of kings, which
   fall into ruins during the lapse of time, or are in danger of being
   destroyed by other means; but that it was founded to stand entire, even
   to the end of the world. If it is objected that the temple was
   destroyed by the Chaldeans and Assyrians, the answer is obvious, That
   the stability celebrated consists in Christ alone; for, if the ancient
   sanctuary, which was only a figure, is considered merely in itself,
   without any regard to that which it typified, it will be only an empty
   shadow. But as God intended it to be a pledge to show that Christ was
   to come, perpetuity is justly attributed to it. In like manner it is
   said, in another place, (Psalm 87:1,) "His foundation is in the holy
   mountains;" and in Isaiah, (Isaiah 14:32,) "The Lord hath founded
   Zion;" and again, in Psalm 74:2, God is said "to dwell in mount Zion,"
   so that it should never be moved.

   70. And he chose David his servant. After having made mention of the
   temple, the prophet now proceeds to speak of the kingdom; for these two
   things were the chief signs of God's choice of his ancient people, and
   of his favor towards them; and Christ also hath appeared as our king
   and priest to bring a full and perfect salvation to us. He proves that
   David was made king by God, who elevated him from the sheepfold, and
   from the keeping of cattle, to the royal throne. It serves in no small
   degree to magnify the grace of God, that a peasant was taken from his
   mean shepherd's cot, and exalted to the dignity of a king. Nor is this
   grace limited to the person of David. We are taught that whatever worth
   there was in the children of Abraham, flowed from the fountain of God's
   mercy. The whole glory and felicity of the people consisted in the
   kingdom and priesthood; and both these are attributed to the pure grace
   and good pleasure of God. And it was requisite that the commencement of
   the kingdom of Christ should be lowly and contemptible, that it might
   correspond with its type, and that God might clearly show that he did
   not make use of external aids in order to accomplish our salvation.

   71. He took him from following the suckling ewes, etc. The grace of God
   is farther commended from the circumstance, that David, who was a
   keeper of sheep, was made the shepherd of the chosen people and
   heritage of God. There is an allusion to David's original condition;
   but the Spirit of God, at the same time, shows us the difference
   between good and lawful kings, and tyrants, robbers, and insatiable
   extortioners, by telling us that whoever would aspire to the character
   of the former must be like shepherds.

   It is afterwards added, (verse 72,) that David had faithfully performed
   the duties of the trust committed to him. By this the prophet
   indirectly rebukes the ingratitude and perverseness of the people, who
   not only overturned the holy and inviolable order which God had
   established, but who had also, in shaking off his salutary yoke, thrown
   themselves into a state of miserable dispersion. What follows
   concerning the prudence of David's hands seems to be an improper form
   of expression. But it is intended forcibly to express, that he not only
   was successful in what he had undertaken, but that he was governed by
   the Spirit of God, which prevented him from putting his hand at random
   to any work which might come in his way, and led him prudently and
   skilfully to do that to which faith and duty called him; and thus, in
   the success of his undertakings, his wisdom appears more conspicuous
   than his good fortune.

   [365] "The epocha to which the Psalmist brings down the Israelitish
   history was the exaltation of David, and the establishment of the royal
   and ecclesiastical pre-eminence of Judah and Jerusalem. Previous to
   that period, Ephraim was in some sort the leading tribe; and the first
   erection of the tabernacle in Shiloh, whither the tribes went up, gave
   to the sons of Joseph a kind of metropolitan dignity in Israel. Hence,
   this period is considered as the time of their precedency in the
   nation. But the children of Ephraim, or Israel, under their precedency,
   had been faithless to their trust, and in the day of trial, had not
   answered to their promise and professions. And to this was owing the
   low estate, in which the administrations of Samuel and David found the
   Church and people of Israel." -- Fry.

   [366] Shiloh, as formerly observed, was a city in the tribe of Ephraim,
   and it was rejected as the resting-place of the ark.

   [367] "La grace de Dieu plus grande qu'on n'eust ose esperer." -- Fr.

   [368] In our English Bible it is, "And he built his sanctuary like high
   palaces." On which Archbishop Secker has the following note: -- "That
   God built his tabernacle like high palaces, is not a strong expression.
   On high, which Hare adopts, is better. And perhaps changing k, into v,
   would suffice for this sense. But the old versions have k, and yet in
   the latter part of the verse they have v, for k. It is a remarkable
   anticipation to mention the temple, which Solomon built, before the
   mention of David."

   [369] "Like the earth; the simile is intended to point out the
   fixedness of the temple, in opposition to the frequent different
   stations in which the tabernacle had been placed." -- Warner.

   PSALM 79

   This is a complaint and lamentation of the Church when severely
   afflicted; in which, while the faithful bewail their miserable and, in
   one sense, undeserved calamities, and accuse their enemies of cruelty,
   they acknowledge that, in another sense, they have been justly
   chastised, and humbly betake themselves to the divine mercy. Their
   confidence of obtaining this, they rest chiefly upon the fact, that
   they saw God's dishonor conjoined with their calamities, inasmuch as
   the ungodly, in oppressing the Church, blasphemed his sacred name.

   A Psalm of Asaph.

   This psalm, like others, contains internal evidence that it was
   composed long after the death of David. Some who ascribe it to him
   allege, in support of this opinion, that the afflictions of the Church
   have been here predicted by the spirit of prophecy, to encourage the
   faithful in bearing the cross when these afflictions should arrive. But
   there does not appear to be any ground for such a supposition. It is
   not usual with the prophets thus to speak historically in their
   prophecies. Whoever judiciously reflects upon the scope of the poem
   will easily perceive that it was composed either when the Assyrians,
   after having burnt the temple, and destroyed the city, dragged the
   people into captivity, or when the temple was defiled by Antiochus,
   after he had slaughtered a vast number of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
   Its subject agrees very well with either of these periods. Let us then
   take it as an admitted point, that this complaint was dictated to the
   people of God at a time when the Church was subjected to oppression,
   and when matters were reduced to the most hopeless condition. How
   cruelly the Assyrians conducted themselves is well known. And under the
   tyranny of Antiochus, if a man dared simply to open his mouth in
   defense of the pure worship of God, he did it at the risk of
   immediately forfeiting his life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 79:1-4

   1. O God! the heathen [or the nations] have come into thy inheritance;
   they have defiled the temple of thy holiness; they have laid Jerusalem
   in heaps. 2. They have given the dead bodies of thy servants for food
   to the fowls of the heaven; the flesh of thy meek ones to the beasts of
   the earth. 3. They have shed their blood like water, around Jerusalem:
   and there was none to bury them. 4. We have been a reproach to our
   neighbors; a scorn and a derision to them that are around us.


   1. O God! the heathen have come into thy inheritance. Here the prophet,
   in the person of the faithful, complains that the temple was defiled,
   and the city destroyed. In the second and third verses, he complains
   that the saints were murdered indiscriminately, and that their dead
   bodies were cast forth upon the face of the earth, and deprived of the
   honor of burial. Almost every word expresses the cruelty of these
   enemies of the Church. When it is considered that God had chosen the
   land of Judea to be a possession to his own people, it seemed
   inconsistent with this choice to abandon it to the heathen nations,
   that they might ignominiously trample it under foot, and lay it waste
   at their pleasure. The prophet, therefore, complains that when the
   heathen came into the heritage of God, the order of nature was, as it
   were, inverted. The destruction of the temple, of which he speaks in
   the second clause, was still less to be endured; for thus the service
   of God on earth was extinguished, and religion destroyed. He adds, that
   Jerusalem, which was the royal seat of God, was reduced to heaps. By
   these words is denoted a hideous overthrow. The profanation of the
   temple, and the destruction of the holy city, involving, as they did,
   heaven-daring impiety, which ought justly to have provoked the wrath of
   God against these enemies -- the prophet begins with them, and then
   comes to speak of the slaughter of the saints. The atrocious cruelty of
   these persecutions is pointed out from the circumstance that they not
   only put to death the servants of God, but also exposed their dead
   bodies to the beasts of the field, and to birds of prey, to be
   devoured, instead of burying them. Men have always had such a sacred
   regard to the burial of the dead, as to shrink from depriving even
   their enemies of the honor of sepulture. [370] Whence it follows, that
   those who take a barbarous delight in seeing the bodies of the dead
   torn to pieces and devoured by beasts, more resemble these savage and
   cruel animals than human beings. It is also shown that these
   persecutors acted more atrociously than enemies ordinarily do, inasmuch
   as they made no more account of shedding human blood than of pouring
   forth water. From this we learn their insatiable thirst for slaughter.
   When it is added, there was none to bury them, this is to be understood
   as applying to the brethren and relatives of the slain. The inhabitants
   of the city were stricken with such terror by the indiscriminate
   butchery perpetrated by these ruthless assassins upon all who came in
   their way, that no one dared to go forth. God having intended that, in
   the burial of men, there should be some testimony to the resurrection
   at the last day, it was a double indignity for the saints to be
   despoiled of this right after their death. But it may be asked, Since
   God often threatens the reprobate with this kind of punishment, why did
   he suffer his own people to be devoured of beasts? We must remember,
   what we have stated elsewhere, that the elect, as well as the
   reprobate, are subjected to the temporal punishments which pertain only
   to the flesh. The difference between the two cases lies solely in the
   issue; for God converts that which in itself is a token of his wrath
   into the means of the salvation of his own children. The same
   explanation, then, is to be given of their want of burial which is
   given of their death. The most eminent of the servants of God may be
   put to a cruel and ignominious death -- a punishment which we know is
   often executed upon murderers, and other despisers of God; but still
   the death of the saints does not cease to be precious in his sight: and
   when he has suffered them to be unrighteously persecuted in the flesh,
   he shows, by taking vengeance on their enemies, how dear they were to
   him. In like manner, God, to stamp the marks of his wrath on the
   reprobate, even after their death, deprives them of burial; and,
   therefore, he threatens a wicked king, "He shall be buried with the
   burial of all ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem,"
   (Jeremiah 22:19; see also Jeremiah 36:30.) [371] When he exposes his
   own children to the like indignity, he may seem for a time to have
   forsaken them; but he afterwards converts it into the means of
   furthering their salvation; for their faith, being subjected to this
   trial, acquires a fresh triumph. When in ancient times the bodies of
   the dead were anointed, that ceremony was performed for the sake of the
   living whom they left behind them, to teach them, when they saw the
   bodies of the dead carefully preserved, to cherish in their hearts the
   hope of a better life. The faithful, then, by being deprived of burial,
   suffer no loss, when they rise by faith above these inferior helps,
   that they may advance with speedy steps to a blessed immortality.

   4 We have been a reproach to our neighbors. Here another complaint is
   uttered, to excite the mercy of God. The more proudly the ungodly mock
   and triumph over us, the more confidently may we expect that our
   deliverance is near; for God will not bear with their insolence when it
   breaks forth so audaciously; especially when it redounds to the
   reproach of his holy name: even as it is said in Isaiah,

   "This is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him, The
   virgin, the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to
   scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. Whom
   hast thou reproached and blasphemed; and against whom hast thou exalted
   thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One
   of Israel."
   (Isaiah 37:22, 23)

   And assuredly their neighbors, [372] who were partly apostates, or the
   degenerate children of Abraham, and partly the avowed enemies of
   religion, when they molested and reproached this miserable people, did
   not refrain from blaspheming God. Let us, therefore, remember that the
   faithful do not here complain of the derision with which they were
   treated as individuals, but of that which they saw to be indirectly
   levelled against God and his law. We shall again meet with a similar
   complaint in the concluding part of the psalm.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [370] If this psalm was written on the taking of Jerusalem by
   Nebuchadnezzar, or during the Babylonish captivity, it would appear,
   from this verse, that when the Chaldeans destroyed Jerusalem, they left
   the bodies of the slain unburied, to be devoured by beasts and birds of
   prey.

   [371] Similar threatenings are to be found in Isaiah 14:19, 20;
   Jeremiah 8:2.

   [372] Street, instead of "our neighbors," reads, "those that dwell
   among us;" and has the following note: -- "Those foreigners who sojourn
   among us; lsknynv, from skn, to inhabit or dwell; geitosin hemon, our
   neighbors, Septuagint. But that rendering does not sufficiently express
   the distressed and humbled state of Israel, as described in the Hebrew;
   they were so reduced, that not only neighboring nations, but even those
   foreigners who sojourned amongst them, had the insolence to deride
   them, even in their own country." Dr Adam Clarke explains, We are
   become a reproach to our neighbors, thus: "The Idumeans, Philistines,
   Phoenicians, Ammonites, and Moabites, all gloried in the subjugation of
   this people; and their insults to them were mixed with blasphemies
   against God."

   Psalm 79:5-9

   5. How long, O Jehovah! wilt thou be wroth for ever? Shall thy jealousy
   burn like fire? 6. Pour out thy fury [373] upon the heathen [or the
   nations] who have not known thee, and on the kingdoms which call not
   upon thy name. 7. For they have devoured Jacob, and made desolate his
   dwelling. [374] 8. Remember not against us the iniquities of former
   times: make haste, let thy compassions prevent us; for we are
   exceedingly afflicted. 9. Help us, O God of our salvation! for the
   glory of thy name; and deliver us, and be merciful to our sins, for thy
   name's sake.


   5 How long, O Jehovah! wilt thou be wroth for ever? I have already
   observed that these two expressions, how long and for ever, when joined
   together, denote a lengthened and an uninterrupted continuance of
   calamities; and that there is no appearance, when looking to the
   future, of their coming to a termination. We may, therefore, conclude
   that this complaint was not ended within a month or two after
   persecution against the Church commenced, but at a time when the hearts
   of the faithful were almost broken through the weariness produced by
   prolonged suffering. Here they confess that the great accumulation of
   calamities with which they are overwhelmed, is to be traced to the
   wrath of God. Being fully persuaded that the wicked, whatever they may
   plot, cannot inflict injury, except in so far as God permits them --
   from this, which they regard as an indubitable principle, they at once
   conclude, that when he allows such ample scope to their heathen enemies
   in persecuting them, his anger is greatly provoked. Nor would they,
   without this persuasion, have looked to God in the hope that he would
   stretch forth his hand to save them; for it is the work of Him who hath
   given loose reins to draw in the bridle. Whenever God visits us with
   the rod, and our own conscience accuses us, it especially becomes us to
   look to His hand. Here his ancient people do not charge him with being
   unjustly displeased, but acknowledge the justice of the punishment
   inflicted upon them. God will always find in his servants just grounds
   for chastising them. He often, however, in the exercise of his mercy,
   pardons their sins, and exercises them with the cross for another
   purpose than to testify his displeasure against their sins, just as it
   was his will to try the patience of Job, and as he vouchsafed to call
   the martyrs to an honorable warfare. But here the people, of their own
   accord, summoning themselves before the Divine tribunal, trace the
   calamities which they endured to their own sins, as the procuring
   cause. Hence it may, with probability, be conjectured that this psalm
   was composed during the time of the Babylonish captivity. Under the
   tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, they employed, as we have previously
   seen, a different form of prayer, saying,

   "All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have
   we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither
   have our steps declined from thy way,"
   (Psalm 44:17, 18.)

   We are not to suppose that, in the passage now quoted, the faithful
   murmured against God, but they employ this language because they knew
   that he had another end in view than simply to punish their sins; for,
   by means of these severe conflicts, he prepared them for the prize of
   their high calling.

   6. Pour out thy fury upon the heathen, who have not known thee. This
   prayer is apparently inconsistent with the rule of charity; for, while
   we feel anxious about our own calamities, and desire to be delivered
   from them, we ought to desire that others may be relieved as well as
   ourselves. It would seem, therefore, that the faithful are to be blamed
   in here wishing the destruction of unbelievers, for whose salvation
   they ought rather to have been solicitous. But it becomes us to bear in
   mind what I have previously stated, that the man who would offer up
   such a prayer as this in a right manner, must be under the influence of
   zeal for the public welfare; so that, by the wrongs done to himself
   personally, he may not suffer his carnal affections to be excited, nor
   allow himself to be carried away with rage against his enemies; but,
   forgetting his individual interests, he must have a sole regard to the
   common salvation of the Church, and to what conduces thereto. Secondly,
   he must implore God to grant him the spirit of discretion and judgment,
   that in prayer he may not be impelled by an inconsiderate zeal: a
   subject which we have treated more at large in another place. Besides,
   it is to be observed, that the pious Jews here not only lay out of
   consideration their own particular advantage in order to consult the
   good of the whole Church, but also chiefly direct their eyes to Christ,
   beseeching him to devote to destruction his enemies whose repentance is
   hopeless. They, therefore, do not rashly break forth into this prayer,
   that God would destroy these or other enemies, nor do they anticipate
   the judgment of God; but desiring that the reprobate may be involved in
   the condemnation which they deserve, they, at the same time, patiently
   wait until the heavenly judge separate the reprobate from the elect. In
   doing this, they do not cast aside the affection which charity
   requires; for, although they would desire all to be saved, they yet
   know that the reformation of some of the enemies of Christ is hopeless,
   and their perdition absolutely certain.

   The question, however, is not yet fully answered; for, when in the
   seventh verse they arraign the cruelty of their enemies, they seem to
   desire vengeance. But what I have just now observed must be remembered,
   that none can pray in this manner but those who have clothed themselves
   with a public character, and who, laying aside all personal
   considerations, have espoused, and are deeply interested in, the
   welfare of the whole Church; or, rather, who have set before their eyes
   Christ, the Head of the Church; and, lastly, none but those who, under
   the guidance of the Holy Spirit, have elevated their minds to the
   judgment of God; so that, being ready to forgive, they do not
   indiscriminately adjudge to death every enemy by whom they are injured,
   but only the reprobate. With regard to those who make haste in
   demanding the execution of the Divine vengeance before all hope of
   repentance is lost, Christ has condemned them as chargeable with
   inconsiderate and ill-regulated zeal, when he says,

   "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of,"
   (Luke 9:55.)

   Moreover, the faithful do not here simply wish the destruction of those
   who so wickedly persecuted the Church, but, using that familiarity
   which God allows them in their dealings with him, they set forth how
   inconsistent it would be did he not punish their persecutors, [375] and
   reason thus: Lord, how is it that thou afflictest us so severely, upon
   whom thy name is invoked, and sparest the heathen nations who despise
   thee? In short, they mean to say, that God has sufficient ground for
   executing his wrath elsewhere, since they were not the only people in
   the world who had sinned. Although it does not become us to prescribe
   to God the rule of his conduct, but rather patiently to submit to this
   ordination,

   "That judgment must begin at the house of God"
   (1 Peter 4:17;)

   yet he permits his saints to take the liberty of pleading, that at
   least they may not be worse dealt with than unbelievers, and those who
   despise him.

   These two sentences, who have not known thee, and which call not upon
   thy name, it is to be observed, are to be taken in the same sense. By
   these different forms of expression, it is intimated that it is
   impossible for any to call upon God without a previous knowledge of
   him, as the Apostle Paul teaches, in Romans 10:14,

   "How, then, shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and
   how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" (Romans
   10:14)

   It belongs not to us to answer, "Thou art our God," till He has
   anticipated us by saying, "Thou art my people," (Hosea 2:23;) but he
   opens our mouths to speak to him in this manner, when he invites us to
   himself. Calling on the name of God is often synonymous with prayer;
   but it is not here to be exclusively limited to that exercise. The
   amount is, that unless we are directed by the knowledge of God, it is
   impossible for us sincerely to profess the true religion. At that time
   the Gentiles everywhere boasted that they served God; but, being
   destitute of his word, and as they fabricated to themselves gods of
   their own corrupt imaginations, all their religious services were
   detestable; even as in our own day, the human invented religious
   observances of the blind and deluded votaries of the Man of Sin, who
   have no right knowledge of the God whom they profess to worship, and
   who inquire not at his mouth what he approves, are certainly rejected
   by Him, because they set up idols in his place.

   8 Remember not against us the iniquities of former times. The godly
   Jews here confirm the sentiment which they had before briefly and
   obscurely touched upon, namely, that they had justly deserved the
   chastisements which had been inflicted upon them. And they present this
   prayer, because they could only get relief from their calamities by
   obtaining reconciliation with God. This is the sovereign remedy for
   every kind of adversity; for so long as he is angry with even our
   prosperity turns out to be unproductive of advantage and happiness. By
   the iniquities of former times, some understand the sins committed by
   the fathers. Others think that the sins which the suppliants themselves
   committed in their childhood and youth are intended. But the
   expression, I presume, has a more extensive signification, containing a
   confession not only of one offense or two, and these only recently
   committed, but an acknowledgement that they had for a long time been
   involved, along with their fathers, in manifold and old transgressions.
   Thus they acknowledge a long continued stubbornness, in which they had
   hardened themselves against God. This acknowledgement corresponds with
   the rebukes which the prophets administered to them; for sacred history
   bears testimony that the punishment of the captivity was suspended
   until God had proved from experience that their perversity was
   incurable. Nor should it excite our surprise to find the children
   praying that God would not impute to them the iniquity of their
   fathers, when we consider that the law declares that God casts the sins
   of the fathers into the bosom of their children, and takes vengeance
   upon their iniquities unto the third and fourth generation, (Exodus
   20:5.) The contrast between the expressions, make haste, and the
   iniquities of former times, is worthy of notice. Had God called the
   Israelites to a strict account for all the sins which they had
   committed during three or four hundred years before, the time of their
   deliverance would have been long delayed. The faithful, therefore,
   beseech him to forget their former offenses, and to make haste to
   succor them. As their sins proved the great obstacle and cause of
   delay, we may see the propriety with which they farther implore that
   the compassions of God might speedily meet them.

   9 Help O God of our salvation! They again repeat in this verse, that
   whatever afflictions they endured were to be traced to the anger of
   God, and that they could have no comfort under them unless He were
   reconciled to them. Being deeply sensible that they had committed many
   transgressions, to strengthen their hope of obtaining pardon, they
   employ a variety of expressions. In the first place, as an argument to
   induce God to show them favor, they address him as the God of their
   salvation. In the second place, they testify that they bring nothing of
   their own to influence him to have mercy upon them; and that the only
   plea which they present before him is his own glory. From this we
   learn, that sinners are not reconciled to God by satisfactions or by
   the merit of good works, but by a free and an unmerited forgiveness.
   The observation which I have made a little before, and which I have
   explained more at length on the sixth psalm, is here to be kept in
   mind, -- That when God visits us with the rod, instead of being merely
   desirous to be relieved from external chastisements, our chief concern
   ought to be to have God pacified towards us: nor should we follow the
   example of foolish sick persons, who are anxious to have merely the
   symptoms of their disease removed, and make no account of being
   delivered from the source and cause of it. With respect to the word
   kphr, chapper, [376] which expositors translate, Be merciful, or
   propitious, I have had an opportunity of speaking in another place. It
   properly signifies to cleanse, or expiate, and is applied to
   sacrifices. Whenever, therefore, we desire to obtain the favor of God,
   let us call to remembrance the death of Christ; for "without shedding
   of blood is no remissions" (Hebrews 9:22.)

   Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him; and have made his habitation
   desolate." From this, some have thought that Jeremiah, who was one of
   the prophets of the captivity, was the inspired writer of this psalm.

   Psalm 79:10-13

   10. Why should the heathen say, where is their God? Let the avenging of
   the blood of thy servants, which has been shed, be made known among the
   heathen in our sight. 11. Let the sighing [or groaning] of the prisoner
   [377] come before thee, [or into thy presence:] and, according to the
   greatness of thy arm, reserve the children of death: [378] 12. And
   recompense our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom [379] their
   reproach with which they have reproached thee, O Jehovah! 13. And we
   thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will confess to thee [380]
   for ever; declaring thy praise from generation to generation.


   10. Why should the heathen say, Where is their God? Here the people of
   God, in urging his name as a plea at the throne of grace: do so in a
   different sense from that in which they had urged it before. He extends
   his compassion towards us for his own name's sake; for, as he is
   merciful, and will have our mouths stopped, that he alone may be
   accounted righteous, he freely pardons our sins. But here, the faithful
   beseech him that he would not allow his sacred name to be exposed to
   the blasphemies and insults of the wicked. From this we are taught that
   we do not pray in a right manner, unless a concern about our own
   salvation, and zeal for the glory of God, are inseparably joined
   together in our exercise. From the second clause of the verse, the same
   question may be raised which we have just now answered. Although God
   declares that he will execute vengeance upon our enemies, we are not
   warranted to thirst for revenge when we are injured. Let us remember
   that this form of prayer was not dictated for all men indiscriminately,
   that they might make use of it whenever impelled by their own passions,
   but that, under the guidance and instruction of the Holy Spirit, they
   might plead the cause of the whole Church, in common, against the
   wicked. If we would, therefore, offer up to God a prayer like this in a
   right manner, in the first place, our minds must be illuminated by the
   wisdom of the Holy Spirit; and, secondly, our zeal, which is often
   corrupted by the turbid affections of the flesh, must be pure and
   well-regulated; and then, with such a pure and well-tempered zeal, we
   may lawfully beseech God to show us, by evident examples, how precious,
   in his sight, is the life of his servants whose blood he avenges. The
   faithful are not to be understood as expressing any desire to be
   glutted with the sight of the shedding of human blood, [381] as if they
   longed greedily after it: they only desire that God would grant them
   some confirmation of their faith, in the exercise of his fatherly love
   which is manifested when he avenges the wrongs done to his own people.
   [382] It is farther to be noticed, that the appellation, the servants
   of God, is given to those who, nevertheless, were justly punished on
   account of their sins; for although he may chastise us, yet he does not
   forthwith cast us off, but, on the contrary, testifies thereby that our
   salvation is the object of his care. Again, we know that when the anger
   of God is extended over the whole body of the Church, as the good and
   the bad are mingled together in her, the former are punished in common
   with the latter, even as Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel, and others, were
   carried into captivity. They were not, it is true, altogether
   faultless; but it is certain that so great a calamity was not brought
   upon the Jews on their account. In their person, there was rather set
   forth a spectacle to the ungodly, that they might be the more deeply
   affected.

   11. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee. The people of
   God, I have no doubt, were in captivity when the Holy Spirit endited
   this prayer; and, therefore, the name of prisoners is applied to them
   all in general, because they were so shut up within the bounds of
   Assyria and Chaldea, that had they stirred one foot thence, they would
   have incurred the penalty of death. They are called the children of
   death; by which is meant, that they were appointed or condemned to
   death in respect of their captivity. This sentence, however, may not
   improperly be restricted to a small number who were shut up in prison
   under closer restraint. By this expression, it is intimated that those
   proud spirits who had before vaunted themselves against God, were now
   broken and effectually humbled. The greatness of God's arm, that is to
   say, the greatness of his power, [383] is implored; for without a
   signal and extraordinary interposition on his part, no hope could be
   entertained of the restoration of the Church.

   12 And render to our neighbors sevenfold. We have already said enough
   on the subject of vengeance; and here the faithful show still more
   clearly, that they are not so much moved by the injuries done to
   themselves personally, as inflamed with a holy zeal when they see the
   sacred name of God blasphemed, and, as it were, torn in pieces by the
   wicked. If this affection reign in our hearts, it will easily moderate
   the ungovernableness of our flesh, and if the wisdom of the Spirit is
   added to it, our prayers will be in strict accordance with the just
   judgment of God.

   In the last verse, the pious Jews declare that the fruit of their
   deliverance will be, that the name of God will be celebrated; and we
   ought not to desire our preservation or welfare for any other end. When
   he freely bestows upon us all things, the design for which he does this
   is, that his goodness may be made known and exalted. Now, these
   sufferers engage to make a grateful acknowledgement of their
   deliverance, and declare that this will not be done merely for a short
   time, but that the remembrance of it will be transmitted to their
   posterity, and pass, in continued succession, from age to age to the
   end of the world. The particular designation here given to them is also
   worthy of notice: We are thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture As
   the posterity of Abraham were chosen to celebrate the name of God, and
   that his praises might resound in Zion, what would have been the
   consequence had that people been destroyed, but that the memory of the
   name of God would have perished? This passage, there is no doubt,
   corresponds with that prophecy of Isaiah,

   "This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my
   praise." (Isaiah 43:21)

   PSALM 80

   This is a sorrowful prayer, in which the faithful beseech God that he
   would be graciously pleased to succor his afflicted Church. To excite
   him the more readily to grant them relief in their distressing
   circumstances, they compare these circumstances with the condition of
   the Church in her beginnings, when the Divine favor was conspicuously
   manifested towards her.

   To the chief musician upon Sosannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph.

   This psalm is almost similar to the preceding; but, in my apprehension
   it was composed in behalf of the ten tribes, after that kingdom began
   to be wasted by various calamities. It is not without reason that
   mention is expressly made of Joseph, Ephraim, and Manasseh. Some
   expositors allege, that in this there is an allusion to the situation
   and order of the camps of the chosen tribes in the wilderness, as
   described by Moses in Numbers 2:18-21; for Manasseh and Ephraim marched
   together on one side. [384] But it would have been strange to have
   passed over in silence the tribe of Judah, and also the holy city, and
   to have brought forward the tribes of Joseph, Manasseh, Ephraim, and
   Benjamin, had it not been intended to speak especially of the kingdom
   of Israel. [385] If it is objected, that the ten tribes from the time
   when they were cut off from the house of David had become degenerate,
   and that the worship of God was corrupted among them, I answer, that
   there dwelt among them, notwithstanding, many devout worshippers of
   God, who had not bowed the knee before Baal, nor abandoned themselves
   to the prevailing superstition, (1 Kings 19:18.) Accordingly, Amos
   (Amos 6:6) finds fault with the hard-heartedness which existed in the
   tribe of Judah, because there was none among them who was "grieved for
   the affliction of Joseph." It is also well known, that during the time
   of this defection, some prophets were sent to them to inspire them with
   the hope of deliverance. Although, then, the vast proportion of them
   were apostates, yet God did not cease to exercise his care over the
   seed which remained in the midst of them. And as formerly he had
   mitigated coming calamities, by promising beforehand his grace; so now,
   by dictating to the people a form of prayer, he confirms and encourages
   them in the hope of obtaining his grace, until they found, from actual
   experience, that they had not been deceived by vain promises. From
   this, we perceive in what respect this and the preceding psalm differ
   from each other. If any one considers what I have now stated
   unsatisfactory, he is at liberty to adopt a different view. But I
   flatter myself, that whoever carefully weighs all the circumstances,
   will readily acquiesce in my opinion. I will not insist upon the words
   Sosannim and Eduth, having already, in Psalm 45th, stated the opinions
   of interpreters concerning them; nor is this a matter of so great
   importance as to render it necessary to expend much labor upon it.
   Besides, those who are most learned in antiquities adduce nothing but
   probable conjectures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 80:1-3

   1. Hearken, O Shepherd of Israel! who leadest Joseph like a flock: thou
   who sittest between the cherubim, shine forth. 2. In the sight of
   Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up [386] thy strength, and
   come to our deliverance. 3. Turn us again, O God! cause thy face to
   shine, and we shall be saved.


   1 Hearken, O Shepherd of Israel! The prophet, previous to his naming
   Manasseh and Ephraim, makes mention of Joseph; and why does he speak of
   Joseph rather than of Judah, but because it was his design to treat
   separately of the kingdom of Israel, the government of which was in the
   family and posterity of Joseph? Nor, since God sent special prophets
   among them, after he had stricken them with his rods, is there any
   inconsistency when, at the same time, the prayer is added, That God
   would gather together the remnant to himself. Moreover, that they might
   not delude themselves by trusting in their spurious worship, the
   prophet, by applying to God the appellation of Him who sitteth between
   the Cherubim, calls them back to the pure doctrine of the law. The
   mercy-seat was a pledge of the presence of God, where he had promised
   to be near his people to hear their prayers. This divinely instituted
   form, it was unlawful for men to change at their own pleasure. The
   Israelites, then, are admonished to return to their original state, if
   they would expect to find God gracious towards them. Besides, by the
   title which is here attributed to God, there is expressed his wonderful
   love towards men in humbling, and, so to speak, lowering himself in
   order to come down to them, and choose for himself a seat and
   habitation on the earth, that he might dwell in the midst of them.
   Properly speaking, God cannot be said to sit; nor is it to be supposed
   that it is possible for him, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain,
   to be shut up in a certain place, (1 Kings 8:27.) But, in accommodation
   to the infirmity of men, he is represented as placed between the two
   Cherubim, that the faithful might not imagine him to be far from them;
   and, consequently, be perplexed with doubt and apprehension in
   approaching him. At the same time, the remark which I have previously
   made must be borne in mind, that the Israelites are here furnished with
   a rule for enabling them to pray in a right manner, that they might be
   withdrawn from the worship of the god fabricated and set up by
   themselves at Dan and Bethel, and that, rejecting all superstitions,
   they might yield themselves to be guided by the true light of faith,
   and follow the Word of God.

   3 Turn us again, O God! The meaning of this prayer is, Restore us to
   our former state. They had petitioned, in the preceding verse, that God
   would stir up his strength in the sight of Ephraim and Manasseh; and
   now they complain that they are but castaways until God succor them,
   and remedy their miserable dispersion. Some understand the words, turn
   us again, in a different way; namely, as a prayer that God would bestow
   upon them the spirit of regeneration. But this interpretation being too
   refined, it will be better, adhering to the former sense, to view the
   expression as meaning that the faithful, under the adversity with which
   they were afflicted, betake themselves to God, whose peculiar work it
   is to restore life to the dead. They acknowledge, on the one hand, that
   all their miseries were to be traced to this as their cause, that God,
   being angry on account of their sins, hid his face from them; and, on
   the other hand, they expect to obtain complete salvation solely through
   the Divine favor. It will be to us, they say, a resurrection indeed, if
   once thy countenance shine upon us. Their language implies, that
   provided God extended his mercy and favor to them, they would be happy,
   and all their affairs would prosper.

   Psalm 80:4-7

   4. O Jehovah, God of Hosts! how long wilt thou be incensed [387]
   against the prayer of thy people? 5. Thou hast fed us with bread of
   tears; and hast given us tears to drink in great measure. 6. Thou hast
   made us a strife to our neighbors: and our enemies laugh at us among
   themselves. 7. Turn us again, O God of Hosts! and cause thy face to
   shine upon us, and we shall be saved.


   4 O Jehovah, God of Hosts! God having in the Scriptures freely
   promised, and so often assured us, that the prayers of his people will
   not be disappointed, it may excite our surprise to find the faithful
   here alleging before him, that he continues unpacified, although they
   betake themselves to him. They complain not only that they are not
   heard, but also that he is angry, when they call upon him; as if he
   purposely rejected this religious service. Where, then, it may be said,
   is that promise recorded in Isaiah 65:24, "Before they call I will
   answer?" To this I would answer, That as God, by delaying to succor his
   people, tries their patience, the prophet, speaking according to the
   judgment of the flesh, represents him as deaf to their prayers. Not
   that it is proper for those who pray to rest in this opinion, which
   would throw an insuperable obstacle in their way to the throne of
   grace. It rather becomes them to strive to cherish, in opposition to
   it, the judgment of faith; and to penetrate even into heaven, where
   they may behold a hidden salvation. But still God permits them, the
   more effectually to disburden their minds, to tell him of the cares,
   anxieties, griefs, and fears, with which they are distressed. In the
   mention here made of the smoke of God's wrath, there appears to be an
   implicit allusion to the incense which was used in the sacrifices under
   the law. The smoke of the incense served to purify the air; but the
   Israelites complain that the heavens were so obscured by a different
   smoke, that their sighs could not come up to God.

   5 Thou hast fed us with bread of tears, etc. By these forms of
   expression, they depict the greatness of their grief, and the long
   continuance of their calamities; as if they had said, We are so filled
   with sorrow, that we can contain no more. [388] They add, in the
   following verse that they were made a strife to their neighbors This
   admits of being explained in two ways. It means either that their
   neighbors had taken up a quarrel against them; or that, having obtained
   the victory over them, they were contending about the spoil, as is
   usually the case in such circumstances, each being eager to drag it to
   himself. The former interpretation, however seems to be the more
   suitable. The people complain that, whereas neighborhood ought to be a
   bond of mutual goodwill, they had as many enemies as neighbors. To the
   same purpose is their language in the second clause, They laugh at us
   among themselves; that is to say, They talk among themselves by way of
   sport and mockery at our adversities. To encourage and stir themselves
   up to repentance, they ascribe all this to the judgment of God, in
   whose power it is to bend the hearts of men. Since we are all at this
   day chargeable with the same sins, it is not surprising that our
   condition is in no degree better than was theirs. But the Holy Spirit
   having inspired the prophet to write this form of prayer for a people
   who felt their condition to be almost desperate, it serves to inspire
   us with hope and boldness, and to prevent us from giving up the
   exercise of prayer, under a consciousness of the greatness of our
   guilt. The seventh verse is a repetition of the third; and this
   repetition is undoubtedly intended as a means of surmounting every
   obstacle. God did not here intend to endite for his people a vain
   repetition of words: his object was to encourage them, when bowed down
   under the load of their calamities, boldly to rise up, heavy though the
   load might be. This ground of support was often presented to them; and
   it is repeated the third time in the concluding verse of the psalm.

   Psalm 80:8-13

   8. Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast expelled the
   heathen, and planted it. 9. Thou hast cleansed the ground before it:
   thou hast rooted its roots, and it hath filled the land. 10. The
   mountains were covered with its shadow, and its branches were like the
   cedars of God. [389] 11. It extended its branches to the sea, and its
   shoots to the river. [390] 12. Why then hast thou broken down its
   hedges, so that all who pass by the way pluck [or tear] it in pieces?
   13. The boar out of the forest [391] hath wasted it; [392] and the wild
   beast of the field hath eaten it up.


   8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt. Under the figure of a vine,
   the singular grace which God was graciously pleased to exercise towards
   his people after he had redeemed them is celebrated; and this
   powerfully contributed to inspire them with the hope of being heard.
   For which of us can be so presumptuous as to dare to come into the
   presence of God until he himself has previously invited us? Now, he
   allures us to himself both by his benefits and by his word. The object
   in view in now presenting his liberality before him is, that he should
   not leave unfinished the work of his hands which he had commenced. It
   is indeed true that, without his word, the benefits which he has
   conferred upon us would make a faint impression upon our hearts; but
   when experience is added to the testimony of his word, it greatly
   encourages us. Now, the redemption of which mention is here made was
   inseparably connected with the covenant of God; for he had, even four
   hundred years before, entered into covenant with Abraham, in which he
   promised the deliverance of his seed. What is stated amounts in short
   to this, that it is unbecoming that God should now suffer the vine
   which he had planted and cultivated so carefully with his own hand to
   be wasted by wild beasts. God's covenant was not made to last only for
   a few days, or for a short time: when he adopted the children of
   Abraham, he took them under his keeping for ever. By the word vine, is
   intimated the high place which this people held in the estimation of
   God, who not only was pleased to hold them as his own inheritance, but
   who also distinguished them by peculiar honor, even as a vine excels
   all other possessions. When it is said that the land or ground was
   cleansed, this is a repetition of what had been previously stated, that
   the heathen were cast out to make room for the chosen people. Perhaps,
   however, the allusion is to the continual digging which vines require,
   in order to their being kept clean lest they should degenerate; this
   allusion being made with the view of showing how God had performed the
   part of a good husbandman towards his people, since, after having
   planted them, he did not cease to employ every means to cherish and
   preserve them. What is added immediately after, Thou hast rooted its
   roots, is not to be understood of the planting of it at first, but of
   the pains taken by God to propagate it, [393] which is a part of the
   culture of the vine. Whence it follows that the mountains were covered
   with its shadow; for the whole country, although mountainous, was
   filled with inhabitants; so much did that people increase in number.
   The branches of this vine are compared to the cedars of God, that is,
   to the most beautiful and most excellent cedars; thereby to express
   still more vividly how eminently the seed of Abraham were blessed of
   God. The sea and the Euphrates, as is well known, were the divinely
   appointed boundaries of the land promised them for an inheritance.

   12 Why then hast thou broken down its hedges? This is the application
   of the similitude; for nothing seems more inconsistent than that God
   should abandon the vine which he had planted with his own hand, to be
   rooted up by wild beasts. It is true that he often threatened and
   forewarned the people by his prophets that he would do this; but what
   constrained him to inflict upon them so strange and dreadful a species
   of punishment was, that he might render their ingratitude the more
   detestable. At the same time, it is not without reason that true
   believers are enjoined to take encouragement from such distinguished
   liberality on the part of God; that, even in the midst of this rooting
   up, they might at least hope that He, who never forsakes the work of
   his own hands, would graciously extend his care towards them, (Psalm
   138:8.) The people were brought to desolation, on account of their own
   incurable obstinacy; but God did not fail to save a small number of
   shoots, by means of which he afterwards restored his vine. This form of
   supplicating pardon was, indeed, set forth for the use of the whole
   people, with the view of preventing a horrible destruction. But as very
   few sought to appease the wrath of God by truly humbling themselves
   before him, it was enough that these few were delivered from
   destruction, that from them a new vine might afterwards spring up and
   flourish. The indignity which was done to the Church is aggravated from
   the contrast contained in the words, when God, on the one hand, is
   exhibited to us as a vine-keeper, and when the destroyers of this vine,
   on the other, are represented to be not only all that pass by, but also
   the wild boars and other savage beasts. The word krsm, kiresem, which I
   have translated to waste, is taken by some for to fill the belly. [394]
   This sense would very well agree with the present passage; but it is
   not supported by the ordinary meaning of the word.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [389] The LXX. read this verse as follows. Ekalupsenore he skia autos,
   kai ai anadendrades autos tas kedrous tou Theou "The shadow thereof
   covered the hills, and the branches thereof [covered] the cedars of
   God." The LXX. seem to have read ksh, casah, covered, instead of ksv,
   cossu, were covered With this agree the versions of the Syriac, Arabic,
   and Vulgate; and this is the reading adopted by Hare, Houbigant, Lowth,
   and Horsley. "Is it an extravagant image of a flourishing vine," says
   Lowth, "to say, that it climbed up even the highest cedars, spread
   itself along the branches, and covered the very top of them?" "The
   image," says Merrick, "may, I think, well be allowed in the description
   of an allegorical vine, which is represented as stretching out her
   branches unto the sea, and her boughs unto the river; especially when
   compared with what Kaempfer says of some foreign vines. Maximum
   proventum vites tribuunt, quae nulla jutae cultura palmites per summa
   spargunt fastigia arborum.' -- Amoenitat Exot Fascic 2, Relat 9,
   Section 2, page 390. The author of the History of the Piratical States
   of Barbary (published in 1750) informs us that some of the vines near
   Algiers climb to the tops of very lofty trees, and, extending
   themselves to others, form natural bowers,' page 163. And Beverley, in
   his History of Virginia, (page 116, ed. 2d,) affirms that he has seen
   great trees covered with single vines, and those vines almost hidden
   with grapes. [...] The vine's covering the cedars, in the Psalmist's
   description, might be intended to suggest an idea not only of its
   extent, but also of its sovereignty, (agreeably to what Musculus writes
   on the place: Operti fuerunt montes umbra ejus, et ramis ejus cedri
   Dei: Ponit haec de potentia regni Israelitici,' etc.,) as a Greek poet
   has, from this very circumstance, represented the vine as the mistress
   of the trees. (Nonnus, Dionysiac L. 12, 278, 279.")

   [390] The sea -- the river -- i.e., the Mediterranean, which was the
   Western, and the Euphrates, which was the Eastern boundary of
   Palestine. The Divine promise respecting the extent of the territory of
   the chosen people runs in these terms, (Deuteronomy 11:24,) "From the
   river Euphrates to the uttermost sea shall your coast be." And it was
   fulfilled in the days of Solomon, (1 Kings 4:21; Psalm 72:8.) In his
   time there were Hebrew colonies and garrisons near the river Euphrates.

   [391] According to the Talmud, the middle letter of the word rendered
   forest in this verse, is the middle letter of the Hebrew Psalter.

   [392] The boar out of the forest hath wasted it. "This terrible animal
   is both fierce and cruel, and so swift, that few of the savage tribes
   can outstrip him in running. His chief abode, says Forbes, is in the
   forests and jungles; but, when the grain is nearly ripe, he commits
   great ravages in the fields and sugar plantations. That ferocious and
   destructive animal, not satisfied with devouring the fruit, lacerates
   and breaks with his sharp and powerful tusks the branches of the vine,
   or, with his snout, digs it up by the roots, pollutes it with his
   touch, or tramples it under his feet." -- (Paxton's Illustrations,
   volume 2, page 66.) Homer complains of the ravages of this animal,
   (Iliad, 9. 535;) and Mr Ward remarks, that the buffaloes and wild hogs
   make the like ravages in the orchards of the Hindoos; to prevent which,
   men are placed day and night in proper situations to guard against
   them. -- (Ward's Hindoos, volume 2, page 327.)

   [393] "Mais du travail qu'il avoit prins a la provigner." -- Fr.

   [394] "ykrsmnh, (jechar-semenna,) will destroy it Targum, Will tear it
   up with its tusk Fut pih From chrsm, he cut off, cut down, consumed, a
   quadriliteral, same as the Chaldaic qvsm. Occurs here only in
   Scripture, and, according to others, is compounded of krs, a belly, as
   though vkrs, will fill the belly from it." -- Bythner

   Psalm 80:14-19

   14. Return, I beseech thee, O God of Hosts! look down from heaven, and
   behold, and visit this vine, 15. And the vineyard which thy right hand
   hath planted, and upon [395] the branch [396] which thou hast
   strengthened for thyself. 16. It is burnt with fire; it is cut down;
   [397] they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 17. Let thy hand be
   upon the Man of thy right hand, upon the Son of man whom thou hast
   strengthened for thyself. 18. And we will not go back from thee: thou
   shalt quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. 19. Turn us again, O
   Jehovah, God of Hosts! cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.


   14. Return, I beseech thee, O God of Hosts! In these words it is
   intended to teach, that we ought not to yield to temptation although
   God should hide his face from us for a time, yea even although to the
   eye of sense and reason he should seem to be alienated from us. For,
   provided he is sought in the confident expectation of his showing
   mercy, he will become reconciled, and receive into his favor those whom
   he seemed to have cast off. It was a distinguished honor for the seed
   of Abraham to be accounted the vineyard of God; but while the faithful
   adduce this consideration as an argument for obtaining the favor of
   God, instead of bringing forward any claims of their own, they only
   beseech him not to cease to exercise his accustomed liberality towards
   them. The words, from heaven, have, no doubt, been introduced, that the
   faithful might find no difficulty in extending their faith to a
   distance, although God, from whom they had departed, was far from them;
   and, farther that if they saw no prospect of deliverance upon earth,
   they might lift up their eyes to heaven.

   As to the word knh, cannah, [398] in the beginning of the 15th verse, I
   readily acquiesce in the sense given of it by some who translate it, a
   place prepared; but as some think that there is a change in the Hebrew
   word of the letter g, gimel, into k, caph, so that the reading should
   be gnh, gannah, a garden or vineyard, we leave the reader to judge for
   himself. It is, however, certain that this is a metaphor akin to the
   former, by which is denoted the singular liberality of God in advancing
   this people, and causing them to prosper. The vine-branch which was
   planted by the hand of God is also called the Man of his right hand.

   16 It is burnt with fire. The calamities of the people are now more
   clearly expressed. [399] It had been said that the Lord's vine was
   abandoned to the wild beasts, that they might lay it waste. But it was
   a greater calamity for it to be consumed with fire, rooted up and
   utterly destroyed. The Israelites had perfidiously apostatised from the
   true religion; but, as has been previously observed, they were still a
   part of the Church. We are accordingly warned by this melancholy
   example, of the severity of the punishment due to our ingratitude,
   especially when it is joined with obstinacy, which prevents the
   threatenings and rebukes of God, however sharp and severe they may be,
   from being of any benefit to us. Let us also learn from the same
   example, when the Divine anger is blazing all around, and even when we
   are in the midst of its burning flames, to cast all our sorrows into
   the bosom of God, who, in a wonderful manner, raises up his Church from
   the gulf of destruction. He would assuredly be ready not only to
   exercise without interruption his favor towards us, but also to enrich
   us with his blessings more and more, did not our wickedness hinder him.
   As it is impossible for him not to be angry at the many offenses which
   we have committed, it is an evidence of unparalleled mercy for him to
   extinguish the fire which we ourselves have kindled, and which has
   spread far and wide, and to save some portion or remnant of the Church,
   or, to speak more properly, to raise up even from the very ashes a
   people to call upon his name. It is again repeated that the Church
   perished not by the strength and arms of her enemies, but at the rebuke
   of God's countenance. Never can we expect any alleviation of our
   punishment, unless we are fully persuaded that we are justly chastised
   by the hand of God. It was a good sign of the repentance of these
   Israelites that, as is observed in Isaiah 9:12, "they looked to the
   hand of him who smote them."

   17 Let that hand be upon the Man of thy right hand. Here the Psalmist
   repeats in plain words the prayer which he had expressed under the
   figure of a vineyard, pleading that God would defend, under his hand,
   the Man of his right hand, and the Son of man whom he hath strengthened
   for himself It is uncertain whether he speaks of the king alone, or
   whether the people also are included. Although Jeroboam was anointed to
   be king, yet he did not come to the possession of the royal dignity in
   a lawful way; and God never so approved of any of his successors, as to
   divest the posterity of David of the right and power of dominion. God,
   as we have seen in Psalm 78:67, did not choose the tribe of Ephraim. on
   the contrary, the scepter, by his immutable decree, was given to the
   house of Judah, as is plainly taught in the prophecy of Jacob, (Genesis
   49:10.) It was therefore a base and wicked dismembering of the body,
   when the majority of the people revolted from the house of David, and
   submitted themselves to Jeroboam as their king. Such being the ease,
   why then, it may be said, is the king of Israel prayed for in this
   manner? For removing this difficulty, let it be observed, that although
   that kingdom had an untoward commencement, and God, as is stated in
   Hosea 13:11, gave them a king in his anger, yet he was afterwards
   pleased to tolerate its continuance; and the anointing of Jeroboam
   testified that he had ratified what had been unadvisedly and wickedly
   done by the tumult and rebellion of the people. The nation of Israel
   might therefore say that their king was created and established by God,
   who, with the view of remedying the rupture which had been made, added
   him as a sharer in the royal dignity to the children of David. By that
   rent the state of the people was greatly impaired; but, to prevent an
   entire overthrow, the erection of the ten tribes into a separate
   kingdom, under the sovereignty of Jeroboam, was, as it were, a pillar
   put under it by the secret counsel of God to uphold it.

   I have, however, no hesitation in considering the whole body of the
   Church as comprehended under the expressions, the Man of God's right
   hand, and the Son of man The similar number is very properly made use
   of, it having been the Divine will that the chosen people should be as
   one man. For the same reason, the Apostle Paul also, in Galatians 3:16,
   lays great stress upon the words, one seed; for Ishmael, Esau, and
   others, were separated and scattered when God redeemed arm gathered
   together the seed of Abraham. Thus, by the Son of man is to be
   understood the people whom God had adopted to himself, that they might
   be as one man. [400] But as this oneness depended upon the head, I
   readily admit that the phrase has a particular reference to the king,
   who preserved the greater part of the people from being involved in
   utter destruction. Here again the Prophet, in seeking to obtain the
   Divine favor, founds his argument and hope only upon the benefits which
   God had formerly conferred upon them. "Lord," as if he had said, "since
   it belongs to thee to perfect that which thou hast begun, preserve the
   king whom thou hast given us!"

   In the 18th verse, the faithful engage, upon God's hearing them,
   gratefully to acknowledge his goodness, not only by rendering to him
   the sacrifice of praise, but also by their whole life. Calling upon
   God's name, is here to be understood of "the calves of the lips,"
   (Hosea 45:3;) but when it is said, We will not go back from thee, this
   means the uniform and continued course of the whole life. The verse,
   however, may be interpreted thus: O Lord! we will continue in our
   obedience to thee, even when our circumstances, so far as we can
   perceive, are hopeless; never shall the sharpness of our calamities
   have the effect of driving us to apostasy from thee: and when we are
   restored by thy grace and power, we will magnify thy name. It would be
   superfluous to make any farther observations on the last verse, which
   is repeated for the third time.

   [395] "Hammond thinks it most probable that l, al, upon, is an
   expletive, or that it may refer to r'h, reeh, behold or look, the last
   verb except one in the preceding verse, r'h l, reeh al, look upon

   [396] The original word which Calvin renders branch is vn, ben, son
   "Where," says Horsley, "does vn signify a branch?" It is; however, so
   used in Genesis 49:22, where it is said, "Joseph is a fruitful vn, ben,
   bough, or branch, by a well." The reading of some MSS., and of the
   Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, Æthiopic, and Arabic versions, is the son
   of man, as in the 17th verse; and eighteen of Kennicott's and De
   Rossi's MSS. read vn 'dm, ben adam, son of man It has been thought by
   many that Christ is here intended. Aben Ezra and R. Obadiah thus
   interpret the passage. The Chaldee paraphrase is, "And upon the King
   Messiah whom thou hast strengthened for thyself." Hare, Green, Horsley,
   and Morison, consider the last clause of this verse, "and the branch
   which thou hast strengthened for thyself," as a misplaced anticipation
   of the latter clause of the 17th verse.

   [397] Horsley thinks that the word ksvchh, kesuchah, which Calvin
   renders as a verb, "it is cut down," is probably the noun svchh, with
   the comparative k, caph, prefixed -- "It is consumed in fire like
   refuse;" and he refers to Parkhurst's Lexicon, under the roots, ksch,
   and schh. "This verse," says he, "with the two preceding, should be
   thus rendered: -- Return, we beseech thee, O God of Hosts!
   Look down from heaven and behold, And visit this vine;
   Even the plant which thine own right hand planted,
   Burnt with fire like refuse. --
   At the rebuke of thy countenance they shall perish,'" -- they shall
   perish: They, the spoilers of the vineyard, described under the image
   of the wild boar and beast in the 13th verse. "The Bishop's reading of
   verse 16," says Dr Morison, "is very satisfactory." "They perish. This
   should either be rendered as by our translators and Mr Ainsworth, and
   then the words refer to the vine of the Jewish Church; but if in the
   future, as by Bishop Horsley, it must refer to their heathen
   persecutors. Bishop Horne mentions both, and the original will admit of
   either." -- Williams.

   [398] "Surely, knh, should not be translated vineyard, but plant: and
   probably v should be translated, or understood to mean, even See
   Noldius, Sign. 38." -- Arcbishop Secker "Michaelis and Gesenius derive
   it from knn, texit, with the suffix h. Bochart considers it an Egyptian
   word. knh, verto plantam ex sententia Bocharti (in Phaleg. lib. 1, cap.
   15 and 16, edit. Leusd.) qui putat vocem esse Ægyptiacam. Nam, auctore

   plantam Osiridis vocabant.' Dathe. De Rossi concurs." -- Rogers' Book
   of Psalms, etc., volume 2, 231.

   [399] Under the same allegorical imagery the Prophet Ezekiel represents
   the afflicted state of his country, (Ezekiel 19:10, 12, 13.)

   [400] Muis, Walford, and others, in like manner, suppose these titles,
   The Man of thy right hand, and The Son of man, to belong to the people
   of Israel. Walford translates the 15th and 17th verses thus: -- "The
   scion, which thy right hand planted;
   Even the branch, which thou madest strong for thyself. Let thy support
   be extended to the Man of thy right hand;
   To the Son of man, whom thou madest strong for thyself." And he
   observes on the 17th verse, "The Psalmist here quits the figurative
   representation, and speaks literally of the people of Israel, whom God
   had chosen, and so greatly favored." "From comparing 2 Chronicles
   36:22, 23; Isaiah 44:26-28; 45:1-11, and Jeremiah 25:12, 13," says
   Dimock, "with this verse, might not Jeremiah, or whoever was the author
   of this psalm, mean Cyrus, by these titles, who was prophesied of as
   the restorer of Israel, by name, above a hundred years before his
   birth?" It has been thought by others, and it is highly probable, that
   the phraseology here employed contains a mystic allusion to the
   Messiah. The pious Israelites were accustomed, in times of great
   calamity, to look forward with longing desire to the days of Him who
   should reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of whose kingdom
   there should be no end. These striking expressions, The Man of thy
   right hand, and The Son of man, apply in the fullest and most perfect
   sense to Christ. If the Man of God's right hand be the man placed
   there, to whom can the title apply but to him? for, "to which of the
   angels said God at any time, Sit on my right hand?" (Hebrews 1:3;) and
   much less has he said this of any Jewish king. As to the other
   appellation, The Son of man, it is one of Christ's most definite
   titles, being given to him in Scripture no less than seventy-one times;
   in sixty-seven instances by himself; once by Daniel; once by the martyr
   Stephen; and twice by the Apostle John in the Revelation. He it is,
   too, whom the Father has made strong for the salvation of his Church,
   and who will yet turn away iniquity from the chosen people, and restore
   them to a place in the Church, so that henceforth they "will not go
   back from God."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [384] This is the opinion of Hammond, who supposes that this psalm "is
   a complaint of the troubles of God's Church and people, probably in
   time of captivity, or by way of prediction of it." "Why Ephraim,
   Benjamin, and Manasseh, and no other, are here named," says he, "must
   be learned from the order of the Israelites' march in the wilderness,
   Numbers 2. For there, next after the ark, the pledge of God's special
   presence and assistance, did these three tribes follow: Then the
   tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward,' etc., verse 17; On
   the west side (i.e., next behind it) shall be the standard of the camp
   of Ephraim,' verse 18; and his host,' etc., verse 19. And by him shall
   be the tribe of Manasseh,' verse 20; and his host,' etc., verse 21.
   Then the tribe of Benjamin, and his host,' verses 22, 23. Now the
   returning from the captivity, the desire whereof is the business of
   this psalm, being a parallel to the delivery from Egypt, God's leading
   them back, stirring up himself, and coming to save them,' is very
   fitly. begged, and described in a style resembling the former rescue."
   Merrick accounts for Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, being
   particularly specified, by supposing the psalm to have been written at
   a time when some enemy was advancing towards these tribes, which were
   contiguously situated, or was directing his march to Jerusalem, through
   their territories. "Such an occasion," he observes, "might make it very
   proper for the Psalmist to pray that the people of those tribes might
   particularly be made spectators of the divine interposition. If the
   psalm was not written on any such occasion, it may be most reasonable
   to suppose, that Benjamin, Joseph's only brother by the same mother,
   and Ephraim and Manasseh his sons, are in the second verse equivalent
   to Joseph; who, in the preceding verse, represents the whole posterity
   of Israel."

   [385] The argument which Calvin here adduces in support of the opinion,
   that this psalm relates to the ten tribes which constituted the kingdom
   of Israel, in contradistinction to the kingdom of Judah, is evidently
   inconclusive. He seems to have forgotten the fact that the tribe of
   Benjamin, which is expressly specified, did not belong to the kingdom
   of Israel, but formed a part of the kingdom of Judah, -- a fact which
   is altogether destructive of the argument by which he attempts to prove
   that the psalm relates exclusively or especially to the kingdom of
   Israel. The whole of God's ancient people seem therefore to be
   intended. It may farther be observed, that the calamities which are
   referred to are so extensive and general, as to render it in a high
   degree probable, that the entire body of that people are spoken of.
   This view is also confirmed, from the introduction of the similitude of
   a vine transplanted from Egypt. The subject of the psalm may be the
   same with that of the 79th -- the calamitous condition into which the
   chosen people were brought by the arms of Nebuchadnezzar.

   PSALM 81

   This psalm consists of two parts. Whoever was its author, he exhorts
   the people to remember the unparalleled grace of God towards them, in
   delivering them by his outstretched arm, and choosing them to be a
   kingdom of priests, and a peculiar Church to himself; that thus they
   may be excited devoutly to honor their deliverer, both by celebrating
   his praises, and by leading a holy life. God is next introduced as
   upbraiding them for their ingratitude in continuing obstinately to
   refuse to submit to the yoke of the law, notwithstanding the tender and

   Psalm 81:1-3

   1. Sing joyfully to God our strength sing with a loud voice: to the God
   of Jacob. 2. Raise a song, [402] and bring forth the tabret, the
   pleasant harp, with the psaltery. [403] 3. Sound the trumpet at the new
   moon; at the time appointed on the day of our sacrifice. [404] 4. For
   this is a statute to Israel, a law to the God of Jacob. 5. He set it
   for a testimony in Joseph, when he went forth over [or above] the land
   of Egypt: I heard a language which I understood not. 6. I removed his
   shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the pots. [405] 7.
   Thou didst cry in trouble, and I delivered thee: I answered thee in the
   secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.


   1 Sing joyfully to God our strength. This psalm, it is probable, was
   appointed to be sung on the festival days on which the Jews kept their
   solemn assemblies. In the exordium, there is set forth the order of
   worship which God had enjoined. They were not to stand deaf and dumb at
   the tabernacle; for the service of God does not consist in indolence,
   nor in cold and empty ceremonies; but they were, by such exercises as
   are here prescribed, to cherish among themselves the unity of faith; to
   make an open profession of their piety; to stir up themselves to
   continual progress therein; to endeavor to join, with one accord, in
   praising God; and, in short, to continue steadfast in the sacred
   covenant by which God had adopted them to himself.

   Such having been the use of festival days under the law, we may
   conclude, that whenever true believers assemble together at the present
   day, the end which they ought to have in view is to employ themselves
   in the exercises of religion -- to call to their remembrance the
   benefits which they have received from God -- to make progress in the
   knowledge of his word -- and to testify the oneness of their faith. Men
   only mock God by presenting to him vain and unprofitable ceremonies,
   unless the doctrine of faith go before, stirring them up to call upon
   God; and unless, also, the remembrance of his benefits furnish matter
   of praise. Yea, rather it is a profanation of his name, when people
   quench the light of divine truth, and satisfy themselves with
   performing mere outward service. Accordingly, the faithful are here not
   only enjoined to come together to the tabernacle, but are also taught
   the end for which they are to assemble there, which is, that the free
   and gracious covenant which God has made with them may be brought anew
   to their remembrance, for increasing their faith and piety, that thus
   the benefits which they have received from him may be celebrated, and
   their hearts thereby moved to thanksgiving. With respect to the tabret,
   harp, and psaltery, we have formerly observed, and will find it
   necessary afterwards to repeat the same remark, that the Levites, under
   the law, were justified in making use of instrumental music in the
   worship of God; it having been his will to train his people, while they
   were as yet tender and like children, by such rudiments, until the
   coming of Christ. But now when the clear light of the gospel has
   dissipated the shadows of the law, and taught us that God is to be
   served in a simpler form, it would be to act a foolish and mistaken
   part to imitate that which the prophet enjoined only upon those of his
   own time. From this, it is apparent that the Papists have shown
   themselves to be very apes in transferring this to themselves. Under
   the new moon, by the figure synecdoche, is comprehended all the other
   high feasts. Sacrifices were daily offered; but the days on which the
   faithful met together at the tabernacle, according to the express
   appointment of the law, are called, by way of eminence, the days of
   sacrifice.

   4 For this is a statute to Israel. To give the more effect to the
   preceding exhortation, it is here taught that this law or ordinance had
   been prescribed to God's ancient people, for the purpose of ratifying
   the everlasting covenant. And as in covenants there is a mutual
   agreement between the parties, it is declared that this statute was
   given to Israel, and that God, in contracting, reserved this for
   himself, as a right to which he was justly entitled.

   5 He set it for a testimony in Joseph. The Hebrew word dvh, eduth, is
   by some derived from dh, adah, which signifies to adorn; and they
   translate it the honor or ornament of Joseph. But it rather comes from
   the verb vd, ud, to testify; and the scope of the passage requires that
   it should be translated a testimony or covenant. Farther, when Joseph
   is named in particular, there is a reference to the first original of
   the chosen people, when, after the death of Jacob, the twelve tribes
   were distinguished. As the sovereignty had not at that time come to the
   tribe of Judah, and as Reuben had fallen from his right of
   primogeniture, the posterity of Joseph justly had the pre-eminence, on
   account of the benefits which he had been instrumental in conferring;
   having been the father and nourisher of his brethren and of the whole
   nation. Moreover, the sacredness of the covenant is commended by a
   special appeal to the fact, that at the time when God stipulated that
   this honor should be yielded to him, he had purchased that people to
   himself; as if it had been said, The condition upon which the people
   were delivered was, that they should assemble together on the days
   appointed for renewing the remembrance of the grace which had been
   exercised towards them. The words when he went forth will apply equally
   to God and to the people. [406] It is a common form of expression to
   speak of God as going forth before his people, as a shepherd goes
   before his flock, or as a general before his army. When it is said
   ABOVE the land of Egypt, some think there is an allusion to the
   situation of Judea, which was higher than that of Egypt; so that those
   who come out of Egypt to Judea ascend. But I understand the language as
   meaning simply, that the people, having God for their conductor, passed
   freely and without obstruction through the land of Egypt, the
   inhabitants having been so discouraged and dismayed as not to dare to
   make any opposition to their passage. [407] The prophet enhances the
   blessing of their deliverance, when, speaking in the name of the whole
   people, he affirms that he had been rescued from profound barbarism: I
   heard a language which I understood not. [408] Nothing is more
   disagreeable than to sojourn among a people with whom we can hold no
   communication by language, which is the chief bond of society. Language
   being, as it were, the image and mirror of the mind, those who cannot
   employ it in their mutual intercourse are no less strangers to one
   another than the wild beasts of the forest. When the Prophet Isaiah
   (Isaiah 33:19) intends to denounce a very dreadful punishment, he says,
   "Thou shalt see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou
   canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not
   understand." Thus the people acknowledge that the benefit which God
   conferred was so much the more to be valued, because they were
   delivered from the Egyptians, with whose language they were
   unacquainted. [409]

   6 I have removed his shoulder from the burden. Here God begins to
   recount the benefits which he had bestowed upon the Israelites, and the
   many ways in which he had laid them under obligations to him. The more
   galling the bondage was from which they had been delivered, the more
   desirable and precious was their liberty. When, therefore, it is
   affirmed that their burdens were so heavy that they stooped under them,
   and that they were doomed to the labor of making bricks, and to other
   slavish and toilsome occupations, the comparison of this their first
   state with their condition afterwards is introduced to illustrate the
   more strikingly the greatness of the blessing of their deliverance. Let
   us now apply this to ourselves, and elevate our minds to a higher
   subject, of which it was an image. As God has not only withdrawn our
   shoulders from a burden of brick, and not only removed our hands from
   the kilns, but has also redeemed us from the cruel and miserable
   tyranny of Satan, and drawn us from the depths of hell, the obligations
   under which we lie to him are of a much more strict and sacred kind
   than those under which he had brought his ancient people.

   7 Thou didst cry in trouble, and I delivered thee. Here the same
   subject is prosecuted. By their crying when they were in distress, I
   understand the prayers which they then offered to God. It sometimes
   happens that those who are reduced to extremity bewail their calamities
   with confused crying; but as this afflicted people still had in them
   some remains of godliness, and as they had not forgotten the promise
   made to their fathers, I have no doubt that they directed their prayers
   to God. Even men without religion, who never think of calling upon God,
   when they are under the pressure of any great calamity, are moved by a
   secret instinct of nature to have recourse to Him. This renders it the
   more probable that the promise was, as it were, a schoolmaster to the
   Israelites, leading them to look to God. As no man sincerely calls upon
   Him but he who trusts in him for help; this crying ought the more
   effectually to have convinced them that it was their duty to ascribe to
   Him alone the deliverance which was offered them. By the secret place
   of thunder some, in my opinion, with too much refinement of
   interpretation, understand that God by thundering rendered the
   groanings of the people inaudible to the Egyptians, that by hearing
   them the Egyptians might not become the more exasperated. But the
   meaning simply is, that the people were heard in a secret and wonderful
   manner, while, at the same time, manifest tokens were given by which
   the Israelites might be satisfied that they were succoured by the
   Divine hand. God, it is true, was not seen by them face to face; but
   the thunder was an evident indication of his secret presence among
   them. [410] To make them prize more highly this benefit, God
   upbraidingly tells them that they were unworthy of it, having given
   such a manifest proof at the waters of Meribah, [411] that they were of
   a wicked and perverse disposition, Exodus 17:7. Your wickedness, as if
   he had said, having at that time so openly shown itself, surely it must
   from this be incontrovertible that my favor to you did not proceed from
   any regard to your good desert. This rebuke is not less applicable to
   us than to the Israelites; for God not only heard our groanings when we
   were afflicted under the tyranny of Satan, but before we were born
   appointed his only begotten Son to be the price of our redemption; and
   afterwards, when we were his enemies, he called us to be partakers of
   his grace, illuminating our minds by his gospel and his Holy Spirit;
   while we, notwithstanding, continue to indulge in murmuring, yea, even
   proudly rebel against Him.

   [402] "Take a psalm. Ainsworth, Take up a psalm. Bishop Horsley says,
   The word (psalm) must in this place denote some musical instrument.'
   But, with all due deference to his Lordship, suppose a clergyman in the
   present day were to say to his clerk, Strike up a psalm!' (quite a
   similar phrase,) would the clerk understand him to mean a musical
   instrument? Certainly not." -- Williams.

   [403] For an account of these musical instruments, [14]see Appendix.

   [404] Hammond translates this verse thus, "Blow the trumpet on the
   first day of the month, on the new moon, on the day of our feast." "The
   word khds," says he, "must here be rendered, in the beginning of the
   month, that so kksh, that follows, may be rendered, as it truly
   signifies, in the new moon. It is true, that from hds, new, hds
   indifferently signifies the novilunium, and the first day of the month;
   but here, the new moon being peculiarly expressed by ksh, to avoid
   tautology, hds must be rendered the new month; i.e., the first day of
   the month. The Syriac sets this down here most expressly, 'In the
   beginning or first of the month, and in the new moon;' which, meeting
   always together, were festival among the Jews, and so the trumpet was
   to be sounded thereon." [Note: The Hebrew words and stems being
   discussed in this footnote require punctuation which cannot be shown
   using the OLBHEB font. The reader should refer to the original
   commentary for the actual puctuation. -- sg.]

   [405] The word translated pot was, according to Kennicott, a large
   vessel in which the earth was mixed and worked up for making the
   bricks. The LXX. the Vulgate, Symmachus, Jerome, Street, Parkhurst,
   Ainsworth, Fry, Walford, and others, render the original word, by the
   basket. Parkhurst observes, that baskets might probably be employed
   both in carrying the earth of which the bricks were made, and also the
   bricks themselves.

   [406] "When he went forth, etc.; i.e., When God went forth to destroy
   the first-born in all the land of Egypt, on account of which the
   passover was appointed." -- Walford.

   [407] "Going forth (l) over the land of Egypt seems to express dominion
   over it, which God exercised in bringing out the Israelites; and they
   were then in what may be called a state of superiority over the
   Egyptians, and went out with a high hand. Exodus 14:8; Numbers 33:3.
   And soon after that the law was given." -- Archbishop Secker

   [408] The Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, and all the versions except the
   Chaldee, have the third person, "He heard a language which he
   understood not;" Doederlein reads, "I heard a voice which I understood
   not;" and retaining the first person, interprets the words as an abrupt
   exclamation of the Psalmist upon feeling himself suddenly influenced by
   a divine afflatus, and upon hearing an oracle addressed to him by God,
   which consisted of what immediately follows, from the 6th verse to the
   close of the psalm, and which is spoken in the person of God. This
   voice he heard, but he did not understand it; that is, he did not fully
   comprehend its design and import.

   [409] "The Egyptian language was not intelligible to the children of
   Jacob; for Joseph spake to his brethren by an interpreter, when he
   appeared as ruler of Egypt, and did not as yet choose to make himself
   known to them. See Genesis 42:23." -- Street.

   [410] Bishop Lowth understands by "the secret place of thunder" the
   communication of the Israelites with God upon mount Sinai, the
   awfulness of which is expressed by these few words. (Lowth's Lectures
   on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews, volume 2, page 220.) Walford
   reads, "I answered thee by thunder, from a hidden retreat;" and he
   observes, that this contains "a reference to the majestic display on
   Sinai, where, though the symbols of the present Deity were seen and
   heard, the lightnings and thunders, he himself was concealed from all
   human view." The only objection which can be made against interpreting
   this of Sinai is, that the murmuring at Meribah, Exodus 17, was before
   the thundering on Sinai, Exodus 19; whereas here the thunder is
   mentioned first, and then what took place at Meribah in the end of the
   verse. But this objection is easily removed; for in the poetical
   compositions of Scripture strict order is not, always observed in the
   narration of facts. Thus in Psalm 83:9, the victory over the Midianites
   (Judges 7) is mentioned before that over Sisera, (Judges 4,) which was
   the victory first achieved.

   [411] Literally "the waters of contradiction;" mryvh, meribah, from
   rvv, rub, to quarrel, being a noun signifying contention, strife It is
   therefore fitly used as the name of the place in the desert where the
   Israelites quarrelled with Moses. "The local specification," observes
   Bishop Mant, "as used in our Bible translation, is much more poetical
   than the rendering in the Common Prayer-Book, the waters of strife.'"
   "The mention of Meribah," says Lowth, "introduces another idea, namely,
   the ingratitude and contumacy of the Israelites, who appear to have
   been ever unmindful of the favors and indulgence of their heavenly
   Benefactor."

   Psalm 81:8-12

   8. Hear, O my people! and I will protest to thee: [412] O Israel! if
   thou wilt hearken to me. 9. Let there be no strange god in thee:
   neither worship thou a strange god. 10. I am Jehovah thy God, who
   brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will
   fill it. 11. But my people hearkened not to my voice, and Israel would
   none of me 12. And I gave them up to the thoughts [413] of their own
   heart: they shall walk in their own counsels.


   8 Hear, O my people! The more effectually to touch the hearts of the
   people, God is here invested with the character of a teacher, and
   introduced as speaking familiarly in the midst of the congregation; and
   this is done for the purpose of instructing them, that all assemblies
   are unprofitable and trifling in which the voice of God stirring up men
   to faith and true godliness is not uttered. But let us proceed to the
   consideration of the words. This preface was intended to teach in a few
   words, that festival days were not purely and rightly observed unless
   the people listened with attention to the voice of God. In order to
   consecrate their hands, feet, eyes, and their whole persons, to his
   service, it behoved them, in the first place, to open their ears to his
   voice. Thus the lesson is taught that he acknowledges as his servants
   those only who are disposed to become learners. By the word protest he
   intimates that he covenants after a solemn manner, thereby to give his
   words the greater authority. The clause which follows, O Israel! if
   thou wilt hearken to me, is, I presume, an abrupt expression, similar
   to what is frequently employed in pathetic discourses, the ellipse
   serving to express the greater earnestness. Some connect it with the
   following verse in this way, O Israel! if thou wilt hearken to me,
   there will be no strange god in thee But it is rather to be viewed as
   the language of regret on the part of God. He indirectly intimates that
   he distrusts this obstinate and rebellious people, and can hardly
   indulge the hope that they will prove obedient and teachable.

   9 Let there be no strange god [414] in thee. Here there is propounded
   the leading article of the covenant, and almost the whole sum of it,
   which is, that God alone must have the pre-eminence. Some may prefer
   this explanation: O Israel! if thou wilt hearken to me, there is
   nothing which I more strictly require or demand from thee than that
   thou shouldst be contented with me alone, and that thou shouldst not
   seek after strange gods: and of this opinion I am far from
   disapproving. God by this language undoubtedly confirms the truth which
   he so frequently inculcates elsewhere in the law and the prophets, that
   he is so jealous a God as not to allow another to be a partaker of the
   honor to which he alone is entitled. But at the same time he teaches us
   that true religious worship begins with obedience. The order which
   Moses observes is different, Exodus 20:2, 4, and Deuteronomy 5:6, 8. In
   these passages God sets out with declaring that he is the God of
   Israel; and then he forbids them to make for themselves any new gods.
   But here the prohibition is put first, and then the reason of it is
   subjoined, which is, that the people ought to be abundantly satisfied
   with the God who had purchased them to be his people. Perhaps also he
   sets this in the front to prepare the way for his obtaining the throne
   of their hearts. He would first withdraw the people from superstitions,
   as these must necessarily be plucked up and cleared away before true
   religion can take root in our hearts.

   10. I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt:
   open thy mouth wide. God, by making mention of the deliverance which he
   had wrought for the people, put a bridle upon those whom he had taken
   under his protection, by which he might hold them bound to his service;
   and now he assures them, that with respect to the time to come, he had
   an abundant supply of all blessings with which to fill and satisfy
   their desires. The three arguments which he employs to induce the
   Israelites to adhere exclusively to him, and by which he shows them how
   wickedly and impiously they would act in turning aside from him, and
   having recourse to strange gods, are worthy of special attention. The
   first is, that he is Jehovah. By the word Jehovah, he asserts his
   claims as God by nature, and declares, that it is beyond the power of
   man to make new gods. When he says I am Jehovah, the pronoun I is
   emphatic. The Egyptians, no doubt, pretended to worship the Creator of
   heaven and of earth; but their contempt of the God of Israel plainly
   convicted them of falsehood. Whenever men depart from Him, they adorn
   the idols of their own invention with His spoils, whatever the specious
   pretexts may be by which they attempt to vindicate themselves. After
   having affirmed that he is Jehovah, he proves his Godhead from the
   effect and experience, -- from the clear and irrefragable evidence of
   it in his delivering his people from Egypt, and especially, from his
   performing at that time the promise which he had made to the fathers.
   This is his second argument. The power which was displayed on that
   occasion ought not to have been contemplated apart by itself, since it
   depended upon the covenant, which long before he had entered into with
   Abraham. By that deliverance he gave a proof not less of his veracity
   than of his power, and thus vindicated the praise which was due to him.
   The third argument is, that he offers himself to the people for the
   time to come; assuring them, that, provided they continue to persevere
   in the faith, he will be the same towards the children as the fathers
   experienced him to be, his goodness being inexhaustible: Open thy mouth
   wide, and I will fill it. By the expression open wide, he tacitly
   condemns the contracted views and desires which obstruct the exercise
   of his beneficence. "If the people are in penury," we may suppose him
   to say, "the blame is to be entirely ascribed to themselves, because
   their capacity is not large enough to receive the blessings of which
   they stand in need; or rather, because by their unbelief they reject
   the blessings which would flow spontaneously upon them." He not only
   bids them open their mouth, but he magnifies the abundance of his grace
   still more highly, by intimating, that however enlarged our desires may
   be, there will be nothing wanting which is necessary to afford us full
   satisfaction. Whence it follows, that the reason why God's blessings
   drop upon us in a sparing and slender manner is, because our mouth is
   too narrow; and the reason why others are empty and famished is,
   because they keep their mouth completely shut. The majority of mankind,
   either from disgust, or pride, or madness, refuse all the blessings
   which are offered them from heaven. Others, although they do not
   altogether reject them, yet with difficulty take in only a few small
   drops, because their faith is so straitened as to prevent them from
   receiving an abundant supply. It is a very manifest proof of the
   depravity of mankind, when they have no desire to know God, in order
   that they may embrace him, and when they are equally disinclined to
   rest satisfied with him. He undoubtedly here requires to be worshipped
   by external service; but he sets no value upon the bare name of Deity
   -- for his majesty does not consist in two or three syllables. He
   rather looks to what the name imports, and is solicitous that our hope
   may not be withdrawn from him to other objects, or that the praise of
   righteousness, salvation, and all blessings, may not be transferred
   from him to another. In calling himself by the name Jehovah, he claims
   Godhead exclusively to himself, on the ground that he possesses a
   plenitude of all blessings with which to satisfy and fill us.

   11. But my people hearkened not to my voice. God now complains, that
   the Israelites, whom he endeavored gently to allure to him, despised
   his friendly invitation; yea, that although he had for a long time
   continued to exhort them, they always shut their ears against his
   voice. It is not a rebellion of one day which he deplores: he
   complains, that from the very beginning they were always a stupid and
   hardened people, and that they continued to persevere in the same
   obstinacy. It is assuredly monstrous perverseness to exclude God from
   obtaining access to us, and to refuse to give him a hearing, when he is
   ready to enter into covenant with us, making the terms almost equal on
   both sides. To leave them no room for extenuating their guilt under the
   pretense of ignorance, he adds, that he was rejected with avowed and
   deliberate contempt: Israel would none of me. From this it is evident,
   that their minds were bewitched by the god of this world.

   This is the reason why, as is stated in the following verse, he gave
   them up to the hardness of their own heart, or, as others translate it,
   to the thoughts of their own heart. The root srr, shorer, from which
   the word rendered thoughts is derived, signifies properly the navel
   Accordingly, the translation is very appropriate, which takes this word
   either for the thoughts which are wrapped up in the hearts of men, or
   for the hardness which possesses the heart. It being, however, as is
   well known, a usual thing in the Psalms for the same thing to be twice
   repeated, I have preferred the word thoughts, because it follows
   immediately after, They shall walk in their own counsels. Besides, by
   these words, God testifies, that he justly punished his people, when he
   deprived them of good and wholesome doctrine, and gave them over to a
   reprobate mind. As in governing us by means of his word, he restrains
   us, as it were, with a bridle, and thereby prevents us from going
   astray after our own perverse imaginations, so, by removing his
   prophets from the Jews, he gave loose reins to their froward and
   corrupt counsels, by which they were led into devious paths. It is
   assuredly the most dreadful kind of punishment which can be inflicted
   upon us, and an evidence of the utter hopelessness of our condition,
   when God, holding his peace, and conniving at our perverseness, applies
   no remedy for bringing us to repentance and amendment. So long as he
   administers reproof to us, alarms us with the dread of judgment, and
   summons us before his tribunal, he, at the same time, calls upon us to
   repent. But when he sees that it is altogether lost labor to reason any
   longer with us, and that his admonitions have no effect, he holds his
   peace, and by this teaches us that he has ceased to make our salvation
   the object of his care. Nothing, therefore, is more to be dreaded, than
   for men to be so set free from the divine guidance, as recklessly to
   follow their own counsels, and to be dragged by Satan wherever he
   pleases. The words, however may be viewed in a more extensive sense, as
   implying that the patience of God being worn out, he left his people,
   who, by their desperate perverseness, had cut off all hope of their
   ever becoming better, to act without restraint as they chose. It is a
   very absurd inference which some draw from this passage, that the grace
   of God is bestowed equally upon all men until it is rejected. Even at
   that time, God, while he passed by all the rest of the world, was
   graciously pleased to bring the posterity of Abraham, by peculiar and
   exclusive privilege, into a special relation to himself. At the present
   day, this distinction, I admit, has been abolished, and the message of
   the gospel, by which God reconciles the world to himself, is common to
   all men. Yet we see how God stirs up godly teachers in one place rather
   than in another. Still the external call alone would be insufficient,
   did not God effectually draw to himself those whom he has called.
   Further, as this passage teaches us, that there is no plague more
   deadly than for men to be left to the guidance of their own counsels,
   the only thing which remains for us to do is to renounce the dictates
   of carnal wisdom, and to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

   13. O if my people had hearkened to me! If Israel had walked in my
   ways! 14. I would soon have brought their enemies low, and turned my
   hand against their adversaries. 15. The haters of Jehovah would have
   lied to him, and their time should have been everlasting. 16. I [415]
   would have fed them with the fat of corn: and I would have satisfied
   thee with honey from the rock.


   13. O if my people had hearkened to me! By the honorable designation
   which God gives to the people of Israel, He exposes the more
   effectually their shameful and disgraceful conduct. Their wickedness
   was doubly aggravated, as will appear from the consideration, that
   although God called them to be his people, they differed nothing from
   those who were the greatest strangers to him. Thus he complains by the
   Prophet Isaiah,

   "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib:
   but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider."
   (Isaiah 1:3)

   The Hebrew particle lv, lu, which I have rendered O if! is not to be
   understood as expressing a condition, but a wish; and therefore God, I
   have no doubt, like a man weeping and lamenting, cries out, O the
   wretchedness of this people in wilfully refusing to have their best
   interests carefully provided for! He assumes the character of a father,
   and observing, after having tried every possible means for the recovery
   of his children, that their condition is utterly hopeless, he uses the
   language of one saddened, as it were, with sighing and groaning; not
   that he is subject to human passions, but because he cannot otherwise
   express the greatness of the love which he bears towards us. [416] The
   Prophet seems to have borrowed this passage from the song of Moses in
   Deuteronomy 32:29, where the obstinacy of the people is bewailed in
   almost the same words: "Oh that they were wise, that they understood
   this, that they would consider their latter end!" He means tacitly to
   upbraid the Jews, and to impress upon their minds the truth, that their
   own perverseness was the only cause which prevented them from enjoying
   a state of great outward prosperity. If it is objected, that God in
   vain and without ground utters this complaint, since it was in his
   power to bend the stiff necks of the people, and that, when he was not
   pleased to do this, he had no reason to compare himself to a man deeply
   grieved; I answer, that he very properly makes use of this style of
   speaking on our account, that we may seek for the procuring cause of
   our misery nowhere but in ourselves. We must here beware of mingling
   together things which are totally different -- as widely different from
   each other as heaven is distant from the earth. God, in coming down to
   us by his word, and addressing his invitations to all men without
   exception, disappoints nobody. All who sincerely come to him are
   received, and find from actual experience that they were not called in
   vain. At the same time, we are to trace to the fountain of the secret
   electing purpose of God this difference, that the word enters into the
   heart of some, while others only hear the sound of it. And yet there is
   no inconsistency in his complaining, as it were, with tears, of our
   folly when we do not obey him. In the invitations which he addresses to
   us by the external word, he shows himself to be a father; and why may
   he not also be understood as still representing himself under the image
   of a father in using this form of complaint? In Ezekiel 18:32, he
   declares with the strictest regard to truth, "I have no pleasure in the
   death of him that dieth," provided in the interpretation of the passage
   we candidly and dispassionately take into view the whole scope of it.
   God has no pleasure in the death of a sinner: How? because he would
   have all men turned to himself. But it is abundantly evident, that men
   by their own free-will cannot turn to God, until he first change their
   stony hearts into hearts of flesh: yea, this renovation, as Augustine
   judiciously observes, is a work surpassing that of the creation itself.
   Now what hinders God from bending and framing the hearts of all men
   equally in submission to him? Here modesty and sobriety must be
   observed, that instead of presuming to intrude into his
   incomprehensible decrees, we may rest contented with the revelation
   which he has made of his will in his word. There is the justest ground
   for saying that he wills the salvation of those to whom that language
   is addressed, (Isaiah 21:12,) "Come unto me, and be ye converted." In
   the second part of the verse before us, we have defined what it is to
   hear God. To assent to what he speaks would not be enough; for
   hypocrites will grant at once that whatever proceeds from his mouth is
   true, and will affect to listen just as if an ass should bend its ears.
   But the clause is intended to teach us that we can only be said to hear
   God, when we submit ourselves to his authority.

   14. I would soon have brought their enemies low. Here the Israelites
   are taught, that all the calamities which had befallen them were to be
   imputed to their own sins; for their enemies did not fight against them
   with any other strength than that with which they were supplied from
   above. God had promised that under his leading the chosen people would
   prove victorious over all their enemies; and now to take away all
   ground for charging him with violating his word, he affirms that he
   would not have failed to enable them to do this had he not been
   prevented by their sins. He doubtless intends tacitly to remind them
   that the victories which they had formerly achieved were not owing to
   their own military valor, but to Him under whose conduct they had been
   placed. Now, he tells them that he was not only kept back by their sins
   from putting forth his power to defend them, but that he was also
   compelled by their perverseness to rush against them with the sword in
   his hand, while he left their enemies to remain in undisturbed
   tranquillity.

   15. The haters of Jehovah would have lied to him. Here the same thought
   is pursued, when the Israelites are informed that their enemies would
   have humbly submitted to their authority had not their impiety
   emboldened them to run to excess, when they shook off the yoke of God,
   and waxed wanton against him. In calling these enemies the enemies of
   Jehovah, it is intended to censure the folly of the Israelites in
   breaking the bond of the covenant made between God and them, and
   thereby separating themselves from him, and preventing him from
   forthwith engaging in war in their behalf against those who were alike
   their and his enemies. As earthly princes, when they are disappointed
   of the assistance promised by their allies, are excited to enter into
   terms of agreement with their enemies, and in this way avenge
   themselves on those who have been found to be guilty of perjury and
   covenant-breakers; so God declares that he had spared his own enemies,
   because he had been treacherously and wickedly deceived by the people
   of Israel. Why does he permit his avowed enemies to remain unpunished,
   and cease for a time to maintain his own glory, if it is not because
   his object is to set them in contrast with his own rebellious and
   disobedient people, whom, by this means, he intends to subdue? The
   meaning of the word kchs, cachash, which we have rendered lied, has
   been explained in a previous psalm [417] . It is here intimated that
   peace with the reprobate cannot be looked for except in so far as God
   restrains their rage by hidden chains. A lion shut up in an iron cage
   still retains his own nature, but he is kept from mangling and tearing
   in pieces those who are not even more than five or six feet distant
   from him. Thus it is with respect to the wicked. They may greedily
   desire our destruction; but they are unable to accomplish what their
   hearts are set upon; yea God humbles and abases their fierceness and
   arrogance, so that they put on the appearance of gentleness and
   meekness. The amount of the whole is, that it was the fault of the
   Israelites themselves that their enemies prevailed against them, and
   insolently triumphed over them; whereas, had they continued the humble
   and obedient children of God, these enemies would have been in a state
   of subjection to them. When it is said, their time should have been
   everlasting, [418] the expression is to be referred to the promises;
   and so must the abundance of wheat and of honey, with which they would
   have been fully satisfied. God had solemnly declared that he would be
   their protector and guardian even to the end. The change, then, which
   so suddenly befell them is set before them as a matter of reproach,
   inasmuch as they had deliberately cast away all at once their happy
   state. The same remarks are applicable to the fruitfulness of the land.
   How is it to be accounted for that they suffered hunger in the land in
   which God had promised them abundance of wheat and honey, but because
   the blessing of God had been withheld on account of their iniquity? By
   the fat of corn [419] is meant, metaphorically, pure grain, unless it
   may be thought preferable to understand it of the finest wheat. Some
   are of opinion that the expression, honey out of the rock, is
   hyperbolical, implying that honey would have flowed from the very rocks
   rather than that God would have failed to satisfy his people. But as it
   is evident from sacred history that honey was found everywhere in the
   hollows of the rocks [420] so long as they enjoyed the blessing of God,
   the meaning simply is, that the grace of God would have continued to
   flow in an unbroken and uniform course, had it not been interrupted by
   the perverseness and wickedness of the people.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [415] In our English Bible it is, "He should have fed them." The LXX.,
   Vulgate, and Syriac versions, Green, Walford, and others, read as
   Calvin does, "I would have fed them." "This is the preferable reading,"
   says Walford, "as the common lection introduces a too sudden change of
   person."

   [416] "Nothing," says Dr Adam Clarke on this verse, "can be more
   plaintive than the original: sense and sound are surprisingly united. I
   scruple not to say to him who understands the Hebrew, however learned,
   he has never found in any poet, Greek or Latin, a finer example of
   deep-seated grief, unable to express itself in appropriate words,
   without frequent interruptions of sighs and sobs, terminated with a
   mournful cry -- yl ms ym vl
   vklhy ykrdv l'rsy
   Loo-ghammee-shomeagh-lee
   Yishrael-bid' rakee-yehallekoo! "He who can give the proper guttural
   pronunciation to the letter , ayin; and gives the v, vau, and the y,
   yod, their full Asiatic sound; and does not pinch them to death by a
   compressed and worthless European enunciation; will at once be
   convinced of the propriety of this remark."

   [417] See [15]volume 1, page 301.

   [418] "Their time, etc.: that is, the time, the continuance, the
   prosperity of my people, would have been durable." -- Warner.

   [419] It is an usual phrase with the Hebrews to call the most esteemed
   part of anything chlv, cheleb, "the fat." The word is used with this
   combination in Deuteronomy 32:14; and is adopted again in Psalm 147:14.
   See also Genesis 45:18; Numbers 18:29; and Psalm 73:4. The translators
   of our English version have rendered it here "the finest of the wheat."

   [420] Palestine abounded in wild bees, which, living in the crevices of
   rocks, and in the hollows of trees, furnished honey in great plenty. To
   this there are frequent allusions in Scripture. In Deuteronomy 32:13,
   Moses, speaking of God's goodness to Israel in the song with which he
   closed his long and eventful career, says, "He made him suck honey out
   of the rock." As an evidence of the great abundance of wild honey in
   that country, we may refer to 1 Samuel 14:25, where it is said, "And
   all they of the land came to a wood, and there was honey upon the
   ground; and when the people were come to the wood, behold the honey
   dropped." In proof of the same point, reference may be also made to the
   fact, that a part of the food of John the Baptist in the wilderness was
   wild honey, which most probably he found in rocks or hollow trees. In
   Scripture, the country is frequently described by a familiar phrase, as
   "A land flowing with milk and honey;" and in Job 20:17, we meet with
   the strong expression of "Brooks, floods, and rivers of honey."
   Palestine is still remarkable for this natural production. It may be
   observed, that the change of person in this last verse from the third
   to the first is highly poetical.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [401] There are various opinions as to the time and occasion of the
   composition of this psalm. Bishop Horsley observes, "It is certainly
   older than the time of David; for the use of Joseph's name, in the 5th
   verse, as the name of the whole nation, shows that it was composed
   before Judah became the principal tribe, while the place of worship was
   in the tribe of Ephraim; that is, among Joseph's descendants." "This,
   however," says Fry, "is not conclusive, as a psalm, whenever composed,
   referring to the events of those times, might use the same
   distinctions." According to Walford, it "was most likely written to be
   sung at some celebration of the feast of the Passover, during the reign
   of Jehoshaphat or of Hezekiah." But the generally received opinion is,
   that it was composed, in the first instance, for the feast of trumpets.
   This feast was celebrated on the first day of the month Tisri, which
   was the beginning of the Jewish year, answering to our September. It
   has been supposed by some, that this feast was appointed in
   commemoration of the creation of the world, which is conjectured to
   have been completed at that season of the year. The Hebrew months were
   lunar, and the first day of each month had its religious services,
   accompanied with sound of trumpets, Numbers 10:10; but the feast of
   trumpets was kept with additional sacrifices, Leviticus 23:24; Numbers
   29:1. The trumpets were blown from sunrise until sunset. It appears
   from the book of the Jewish Liturgy, that this psalm is still sung at
   that feast. "It may have been used," observes Dr Adam Clarke, "in
   celebrating the feast of trumpets on the first of Tisri; the feast of
   tabernacles, on the fifteenth of the same month; the creation of the
   world; the feast of the new moons; and the deliverance of the
   Israelites from Egypt; to all which circumstances it appears to refer."

   PSALM 82

   As kings, and such as are invested with authority, through the
   blindness which is produced by pride, generally take to themselves a
   boundless liberty of action, the Psalmist warns them that they must
   render an account at the bar of the Supreme Judge, who is exalted above
   the highest of this world. After he has reminded them of their duty and
   condition, perceiving that he speaks to such as refuse to receive
   admonition, he calls upon God to vindicate his character as a righteous
   judge. [421]

   A Psalm of Asaph.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 82:1-4

   1. God sitteth in the assembly of God: he will judge in the midst of
   the gods. [422] 2. How long will ye judge unjustly? and accept the
   persons of the wicked? Selah. 3. Determine the cause of the poor and
   the orphan; justify [423] the helpless and the destitute. 4. Rescue the
   poor and the afflicted: deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.


   1 God sitteth in the assembly of God. [424] It is unquestionably a very
   unbecoming thing for those whom God has been pleased to invest with the
   government of mankind for the common good, not to acknowledge the end
   for which they have been exalted above others, nor yet by whose
   blessing they have been placed in so elevated a station; but instead of
   doing this, contemning every principle of equity, to rule just as their
   own unbridled passions dictate. So infatuated are they by their own
   splendor and magnificence, as to imagine that the whole world was made
   only for them. Besides, they think that it would derogate from their
   elevated rank were they to be governed by moderate counsels; and
   although their own folly is more than enough to urge them on in their
   reckless career, they, notwithstanding, seek for flatterers to soothe
   and applaud them in their vices. To correct this arrogance, the psalm
   opens by asserting, that although men occupy thrones and
   judgment-seats, God nevertheless continues to hold the office of
   supreme ruler. God has made even a heathen and licentious poet bear
   testimony to this truth in the following lines: --

   "Regum timendorum in proprios greges,
   Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis,
   Clari giganteo triumpho,
   Cuncta supercilio moventis."
   Horatii, Carm. Liber in Ode i.

   "Kings rule their subject flocks; great Jove
   O'er kings themselves his reign extends,
   Who hurl'd the rebel giants from above;
   At whose majestic nod all nature bends."
   Boscawen's Translation.

   That the potentates of this world may not arrogate to themselves more
   than belongs to them, the prophet here erects a throne for God, from
   which he judges them all, and represses their pride; a thing which is
   highly necessary. They may, indeed, admit that they owe their elevation
   to royal power to the favor of God, and they may worship him by outward
   ceremonies, but their greatness so infatuates them that they are
   chargeable with expelling and casting him to a distance from their
   assembly, by their vain imaginations; for they cannot bear to be
   subject to reason and laws. Thus the design of the prophet was to
   deride the madness by which the princes of this world are bewitched, in
   leaving God no place in their assembly. The more effectually to
   overthrow this irrational self-confidence with which they are
   intoxicated, civil order is termed the assembly of God; for although
   the divine glory shines forth in every part of the world, yet when
   lawful government flourishes among men, it is reflected therefrom with
   pre-eminent lustre. I indeed grant that it is quite common for the
   Hebrews to adorn with the title of God whatever is rare and excellent.
   But here it would appear, from the scope of the passage, that this name
   of the Divine Being is applied to those who occupy the exalted station
   of princes, in which there is afforded a peculiar manifestation of the
   majesty of God; even as Solomon, in Proverbs 2:17, calls marriage "the
   covenant of God," from the peculiar sanctity by which that relation is
   distinguished.

   In the second clause of the verse, it is not material whether we read,
   He will judge in the midst of the gods, or, He will judge the gods in
   the midst. The first construction, however, is the most easy and
   natural, That however much the rulers of the world may exalt
   themselves, they cannot in the least impair the authority of God, by
   divesting him of his sovereignty over them and of the government of all
   things, which he will ever retain as his inalienable prerogative. But
   here, as also a little after, the name gods is to be understood of
   judges, on whom God has impressed special marks of his glory. To apply
   it to angels is a fancy too strained to admit of serious consideration.

   2 How long will ye judge unjustly? Many suppose that God is here
   introduced speaking, and that these are the words which he utters from
   his throne of judgment. But I would rather consider the prophet himself
   as the speaker, who, in order to prepare the way for administering a
   rebuke, had spoken in the manner in which he did in the first verse.
   Kings may lift up their heads above the clouds, but they, as well as
   the rest of mankind, are under the government of God; and such being
   the case, it is in vain for them arrogantly to struggle to obtain
   exemption from the obligations of reason. Yet this is what they do.
   Although tyrants are amongst the basest of men, and occupy their
   exalted station by detestable treason, yet if any servant of God has
   the fortitude to open his mouth against them, they immediately attempt
   to shelter themselves by appealing to the sacred name of God, as if
   great wrong had been done to them. Thus, whilst they persuade
   themselves that they are privileged with exemption from the law to
   which the rest of mankind are subject, they endeavor to deprive the
   common people of divine truth and its ministers. In short, they think
   that there can be no sovereignty unless where uncontrolled license is
   enjoyed. But let this principle be once established, "That God rules
   among them," and then a way is opened up for the admission of divine
   truth. Accordingly, the prophet, after having thus laid a foundation
   for his authority, freely inveighs against princes, and reproves the
   very gross vice of selling themselves to those who unrighteously
   oppress the poor, and of being gained by bribes to pervert in their
   administration every principle of justice. He expressly names the
   wicked; for good men will never attempt to corrupt judges. Moreover,
   there is a certain devilish frenzy which infatuates the princes of the
   world, and leads them voluntarily to pay greater respect to wicked men
   than to the simple and innocent. Even supposing that the wicked
   continue inactive, and use no endeavors to obtain for themselves favor
   either by flattery, fraud, bribery, or other artifices; yet those who
   bear rule are for the most part inclined of themselves to the bad side.
   The reason why the prophet upbraids them is, that wicked men find more
   favor at their hands than the good and conscientious.

   3 Determine the cause of the poor and the orphan. We are here briefly
   taught that a just and well-regulated government will be distinguished
   for maintaining the rights of the poor and afflicted. By the figure
   synecdoche, one part of equitable administration is put for the whole;
   for it cannot be doubted that rulers are bound to observe justice
   towards all men without distinction. But the prophet, with much
   propriety, represents them as appointed to be the defenders of the
   miserable and oppressed, both because such persons stand in need of the
   assistance of others, and because they can only obtain this where
   rulers are free from avarice, ambition, and other vices. The end,
   therefore, for which judges bear the sword is to restrain the wicked,
   and thus to prevent violence from prevailing among men, who are so much
   disposed to become disorderly and outrageous. According as men increase
   in strength, they become proportionally audacious in oppressing the
   weak; and hence it is that rich men seldom resort to magistrates for
   help, except when they happen to fall out among themselves. From these
   remarks, it is very obvious why the cause of the poor and needy is here
   chiefly commended to rulers; for those who are exposed an easy prey to
   the cruelty and wrongs of the rich have no less need of the assistance
   and protection of magistrates than the sick have of the aid of the
   physician. Were the truth deeply fixed in the minds of kings and other
   judges, that they are appointed to be the guardians of the poor, and
   that a special part of this duty lies in resisting the wrongs which are
   done to them, and in repressing all unrighteous violence, perfect
   righteousness would become triumphant through the whole world. Whoever
   thinks it not beneath him to defend the poor, instead of allowing
   himself to be carried hither and thither by favor, will have a regard
   only to what is right. We may farther learn from this passage, that
   although magistrates may not be solicited for succor, they are
   accounted guilty before God of negligence, if they do not, of their own
   accord, succor those who stand in need of their interference. When
   iniquity openly prevails, and when, on account of it, sighs and
   lamentations are everywhere heard, it is in vain for them to pretend
   that they cannot redress wrongs, unless complaints are addressed to
   them. Oppression utters a sufficiently loud cry of itself; and if the
   judge, sitting on a high watch-tower, seems to take no notice of it, he
   is here plainly warned, that such connivance shall not escape with
   impunity.

   Psalm 82:5-8

   5. They know not, neither do they understand: they walk in darkness,
   although all the foundations of the earth are moved. 6. I have said, Ye
   are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High. 7. But ye shall die as
   a man; and ye shall fall, O princes: as one of the people. 8. Arise, O
   God! Judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.


   5 They know not, neither do they understand. [425] After having
   reminded princes of their duty, the Psalmist complains that his
   admonition from their infatuation is ineffectual, and that they refuse
   to receive wholesome instruction; yea, that although the whole world is
   shaken to its foundations, they, notwithstanding, continue thoughtless
   and secure in the neglect of their duty. He chiefly reprobates and
   condemns their madness as manifested in this, that although they see
   heaven and earth involved in confusion, they are no more affected at
   the sight than if the care of the interests of mankind did not belong
   to them, of which they are, notwithstanding, in an especial manner the
   chosen and appointed conservators. I have stated a little before, that
   what chiefly deprives them of understanding is, that, being dazzled
   with their own splendor, and perversely shaking off every yoke, no
   religious considerations have the effect of inclining them to
   moderation. All sound knowledge and wisdom must commence with yielding
   to God the honor which is his due, and submitting to be restrained and
   governed by his word. The last clause of the verse, Although all the
   foundations of the earth are moved, [426] is almost universally
   understood by interpreters in a different sense from that in which I
   have rendered it. They explain it as implying, that of all the
   calamities in the world the greatest is when princes neglect to execute
   the duties of their office; for it is the observance and prevalence of
   justice which constitutes the foundation on which the fabric of human
   society rests. Thus the sense, according to them, is, that the world is
   undermined and overthrown by the unjust tyranny of princes. I am far
   from rejecting this interpretation; but, as I have already hinted, I am
   more inclined to think, that we have here condemned the monstrous
   stupidity of judges, who can remain indifferent and unmoved in
   beholding the horrible confusion of civil society, yea even the very
   earth shaken to its foundations.

   6 I have said, ye are gods. God has invested judges with a sacred
   character and title. This the prophet concedes; but he, at the same
   time, shows that this will afford no support and protection to wicked
   judges. He does not introduce them as speaking of the dignity of their
   office; but anticipating the style of reasoning which they would be
   disposed to adopt, he replies, "If you appeal to your dignity as an
   argument to shield you, this boasting will avail you nothing; yea,
   rather you are deceiving yourselves by your foolish confidence; for
   God, in appointing you his substitutes, has not divested himself of his
   own sovereignty as supreme ruler. Again, he would have you to remember
   your own frailty as a means of stirring you up to execute with fear and
   trembling the office intrusted to you." This verse may also be viewed
   as addressed by God himself to rulers, and as intimating, that, in
   addition to his clothing them with authority, he has bestowed upon them
   his name. This interpretation seems to agree with the language of
   Christ in John 10:34, where he speaks of those as called gods to whom
   the word of God came. The passage, however, may be appropriately
   resolved thus: I grant that ye are gods, and the sons of the Most High
   [427] But this does not materially alter the meaning. The object is
   simply to teach that the dignity with which judges are invested can
   form no excuse or plea why they should escape the punishment which
   their wickedness deserves. The government of the world has been
   committed to them upon the distinct understanding that they themselves
   also must one day appear at the judgment-seat of heaven to render up an
   account. The dignity, therefore, with which they are clothed is only
   temporary, and will pass away with the fashion of the world.
   Accordingly, it is added in the 7th verse, But ye shall die as men. You
   are armed with power, as if he had said, to govern the world; but you
   have not on that account ceased to be men, so as to be no longer
   subject to mortality. The last clause of the verse is translated by
   some expositors, Ye shall fall like one of the princes; [428] but in my
   opinion improperly. They think that it contains a threatening of the
   violent death which would befall these unrighteous judges,
   corresponding to the sentiment of these lines of a heathen poet: --

   "Ad generum Cereris sine caede et sanguine pauci,
   Descendunt reges, et sicca morte tyranni."

   "Few kings and tyrants go down to Pluto, the son-in-law of Ceres,
   without being put to a violent death, before they have completed the
   ordinary term allotted to the life of mortal man." [429] That
   translation being forced, and not such as the words naturally suggest,
   I have no doubt that princes are here compared to the obscure and
   common class of mankind. The word one signifies any of the common
   people. Forgetting themselves to be men, the great ones of the earth
   may flatter themselves with visionary hopes of immortality; but they
   are here taught that they will be compelled to encounter death as well
   as other men. Christ, with the view of rebutting the calumny with which
   the Pharisees loaded him, quoted this text, John 10:34, 35, "Jesus
   answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If
   he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture
   cannot be broken; say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and
   sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of
   God?" By these words Christ did not mean to place himself among the
   order of judges; but he argues from the less to the greater, that if
   the name of God is applied to God's officers, it with much more
   propriety belongs to his only begotten Son, who is the express image of
   the Father, in whom the Father's majesty shines forth, and in whom the
   whole fullness of the Godhead dwells.

   8 Arise, O God! judge the earth. The reason why this psalm concludes
   with a prayer has been already stated at the commencement. The prophet,
   finding that his admonitions and remonstrances were ineffectual, and
   that princes, inflated with pride, treated with contempt all
   instruction on the principles of equity, addresses himself to God, and
   calls upon Him to repress their insolence. By this means, the Holy
   Spirit furnishes us with ground of comfort whenever we are cruelly
   treated by tyrants. We may perceive no power on earth to restrain their
   excesses; but it becomes us to lift up our eyes to heaven, and to seek
   redress from Him whose office it is to judge the world, and who does
   not claim this office to himself in vain. It is therefore our bounden
   duty to beseech him to restore to order what is embroiled in confusion.
   The reason of this which immediately follows -- for thou shalt inherit
   all nations -- is understood by some as a prophecy concerning the
   kingdom of Christ, by whom God has brought all nations in subjection to
   himself. But it is to be viewed in a more extensive sense, as implying
   that God has a rightful claim to the obedience of all nations, and that
   tyrants are chargeable with wickedly and unjustly wresting from him his
   prerogative of bearing rule, when they set at nought his authority, and
   confound good and evil, right and wrong. We ought therefore to beseech
   him to restore to order the confusions of the world, and thus to
   recover the rightful dominion which he has over it.

   [421] Kimchi thinks it probable that this psalm was written in the days
   of Jehoshaphat, and refers to 2 Chronicles 19:5-7, as indicating the
   time and occasion of its composition. We are there informed that
   Jehoshaphat; "set judges in the land, throughout all the fenced cities
   of Judah, city by city;" and in instructing them with regard to their
   duty, he uses nearly the same words as those in the beginning of this
   psalm. Dr Morison takes a different view. "This psalm," says he, "was
   composed in all probability in the days of Hezekiah, in reference to
   certain wicked magistrates, (2 Chronicles 29:30,) who had grievously
   perverted the administration of justice, who were guilty of great
   oppression, and who had done much to introduce a state of general
   national corruption. King Jehoshaphat had reformed several public
   abuses which had crept into the judicatories of Israel in his time, (2
   Chronicles 19:7,) but before the reign of Hezekiah, things had reverted
   to their former unhappy condition; so that a public national
   reformation was loudly demanded. The psalm contains an exhortation to
   the judges of Israel, and a reproof for their negligence and
   oppression."

   PSALM 83

   The prophet implores the divine aid against the enemies of the Church,
   and, as an argument for obtaining this the more easily, he enumerates
   the many nations which had conspired together for the express purpose
   of exterminating the people of Israel, and thereby extinguishing the
   very name of the Church of God. To stir up himself and others to
   greater earnestness and confidence in prayer, he shows, by many
   examples, how mightily God had been wont to succor his servants.

   Psalm 83:1-4

   1. O God! keep not silence with thyself; hold not thy peace, and be not
   still, O God! 2. For, behold! Thy enemies are tumultuous: and those who
   hate thee have lifted up the head. 3. They have formed a crafty design
   against thy people, and have consulted against thy hidden ones. 4. They
   have said, Come and let us cut them off from being a nation; and let
   the name of Israel be no more remembered.


   1 O God! hold not thy peace. It is very generally agreed among
   commentators, that this psalm was composed during the reign of king
   Jehoshaphat; and in this opinion I readily concur. That godly king, as
   is well known, had to engage in dreadful wars against multiplied hosts
   of enemies. Although the Ammonites and Moabites were the originators of
   the principal war in which he was engaged, yet they mustered forces not
   only from Syria, but also from distant countries, and the troops thus
   brought together well nigh overwhelmed Judea with their multitude. It
   would then appear, from the long list of enemies, here enumerated, who
   had conspired together to destroy the people of God, that the
   conjecture is well-founded which refers the composition of this psalm
   to that occasion; [430] and sacred history informs us, that one of the
   Levites, under the influence of the Spirit of prophecy, gave the king
   assurance of victory, [431] and that the Levites sang before the Lord.
   In the midst of so great dangers, the whole nation, as well as the holy
   king, must have been involved in the deepest distress; and,
   accordingly, we have here a prayer full of earnestness and solicitude.
   These feelings prompted the repetition of the words which occur in the
   very opening of the psalm, Hold not thy peace, Keep not silence, be not
   still By this, the faithful would intimate, that if God intended to
   succor them, it behoved him to make haste, else the opportunity for
   doing so would be lost. It is unquestionably our duty to wait patiently
   when God at any time delays his help; but, in condescension to our
   infirmity, he permits us to supplicate him to make haste. What I have
   rendered, keep not silence with thyself, is literally keep not silence
   to thyself, which some translate by the paraphrase, Hold not thy peace
   in thy own cause, -- an exposition which is too refined to be more
   particularly noticed. This form of expression is equivalent to saying,
   Hold not thyself in. Perhaps the particle is here superfluous, as it is
   in many other places.

   2 For, behold! thy enemies are tumultuous. As an argument for enforcing
   the prayer of the preceding verse, it is affirmed that the faithful are
   oppressed both by the impetuous violence and the crafty policy of their
   enemies, which, to all human appearance, rendered their escape from
   death utterly hopeless. When it is said that they are tumultuous and
   lift up the head, the meaning is, that relying upon their own power,
   they behave themselves insolently and proudly. By this conduct on the
   part of their enemies, the minds of the people of God are greatly
   depressed, and the only way in which they can obtain relief, is by
   making their moan to Him whose continual work it is to repress the
   proud. When, therefore, the saints implore his aid, it is their
   ordinary course to lay before him the perverseness of their enemies. It
   is worthy of notice, that those who molest the Church are called the
   enemies of God.

   It affords us no small ground of confidence that those who are our
   enemies are also God's enemies. This is one of the fruits of his free
   and gracious covenant, in which he has promised to be an enemy to all
   our enemies, -- a promise for which there is good cause, when it is
   considered that the welfare of his people, whom he has taken under his
   protection, cannot be assailed without an injury being, at the same the
   done to his own majesty. Meanwhile, let us live at peace with all men,
   as much as in us lies, and let us endeavor to practice uprightness in
   our whole deportment, that we may be able confidently to appeal to God,
   that when we suffer at the hands of men, we suffer wrongfully. The
   pride and violent assaults of our enemies may be combined with
   craftiness. But when such is the case, it becomes us to yield to God
   the honor which belongs to him, by resting satisfied that He can succor
   us; for to break the proud who foam out their rage, and to take the
   crafty in their own craftiness, is work which He has been accustomed to
   perform in all ages. To keep us from thinking that we are abandoned to
   the snares and traps of our enemies, the prophet here seasonably sets
   before us a consideration calculated to administer the highest
   consolation and hope, when he calls us God's hidden ones This
   expression is understood by some as meaning that the aid and protection
   which God extends to us, is not apparent to the eye of sense and
   reason; just as it is said elsewhere of the life of the people of God,
   that it is hid, (Colossians 3:3.) But this interpretation is too
   forced, and altogether inconsistent both with the scope of the passage
   and the natural construction of the words. The design of them is simply
   to teach that we are hidden under the shadow of God's wings; for
   although to outward appearance we lie open, and are exposed to the will
   of the wicked and the proud, we are preserved by the hidden power of
   God. [432] Accordingly, it is said in another Psalm, (27:5,)

   "In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret
   of his tabernacle shall he hide me." (Psalm 27:5)

   It is, however, at the same time to be observed, that none are hid
   under the keeping and protection of God but those who, renouncing all
   dependence on their own strength, betake themselves with fear and
   trembling to Him. Such as under the influence of a flattering belief in
   the sufficiency of their own strength to resist, boldly enter the
   conflict, and, as if devoid of all fear, wax wanton, will ultimately
   suffer the consequences which result from inadequate resources. [433]
   We will then best consult our own safety by taking shelter under the
   shadow of the Almighty, and, conscious of our own weakness, committing
   our salvation to him, casting it, so to speak, into his bosom.

   4 They have said, Come and let us cut them off from being a nation. The
   wickedness of these hostile powers is aggravated from the circumstance,
   that it was their determined purpose utterly to exterminate the Church.
   This may be restricted to the Ammonites and Moabites, who were as
   bellows to blow up the flame in the rest. But the Hagarenes, the
   Syrians, and the other nations, being by their instigation affected
   with no less hatred and fury against the people of God, for whose
   destruction they had taken up arms, we may justly consider this
   vaunting language as uttered by the whole of the combined host; for
   having entered into a mutual compact they rushed forward with rival
   eagerness, and encouraged one another to destroy the kingdom of Judah.
   The prime agent in exciting such cruel hatred was doubtless Satan, who
   has all along from the beginning been exerting himself to extinguish
   the Church of God, and who, for this purpose, has never ceased to stir
   up his own children to outrage. The phrase, to cut them off from being
   a nation, signifies to exterminate them root and branch, and thus to
   put an end to them as a nation or people. That this is the meaning is
   more clearly evinced from the second clause of the verse, Let the name
   of Israel be no more remembered The compassion of God would in no small
   degree be excited by the circumstance that this war was not undertaken,
   as wars commonly have been, to bring them, when conquered, under the
   power of their enemies; but the object which the cruelty of their
   enemies aimed at was their entire destruction. And what did this amount
   to but to an attempt to overthrow the decree of God on which the
   perpetual duration of the Church depends.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [430] Compare the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses of the psalm with 2
   Chronicles 20:1, 10, 22; and the 12th verse of the psalm with the 11th
   verse of that chapter.

   [431] The name of this Levite was Jahaziel, and he is expressly said to
   be a prophet of the race of Asaph, 2 Chronicles 20:14. It is not
   unlikely that he is the same with Asaph, the author of this psalm.

   [432] The Hebrew word translated thy hidden ones, primarily means a
   treasure, and is so taken in Psalm 17:14. Accordingly, it is here
   rendered by Mudge, and French and Skinner, "thy treasured ones:" that
   is, thy peculiar people: those whom thou hast hitherto protected and
   kept in perfect safety, as in a place of security and secrecy. The
   Septuagint reads, kata ton hagion sou, "against thy saints." The word
   is also sometimes put for the sanctuary, as in Ezekiel 7:22. Some
   therefore think that the temple, and the treasures contained in it, are
   intended.

   Psalm 83:5-8

   5. For they have consulted with the heart together; they have entered
   into a covenant [434] against thee. 6. The tents of Edom, [435] and the
   Ishmaelites [436] Moab [437] and the Hagarenes. [438] 7. Gebal, [439]
   and Ammon, [440] and Amalek [441] the Philistines with the inhabitants
   of Tyre. 8. Assur is also associated with them: they have been an arm
   to the sons of Lot. Selah.


   5 For they have consulted with the heart together. The multiplied hosts
   which united their powers together to oppose the Church of God and to
   effect her overthrow, are here enumerated. As so many nations, formed
   into one powerful confederacy, were bent on the destruction of a
   kingdom not greatly distinguished by its power, the miraculous aid of
   God was indispensably necessary for the deliverance of a people who, in
   such extremity, were altogether unable to defend themselves. In
   circumstances apparently as hopeless good king Asa gave utterance to
   that truly magnanimous reflection:

   "Lord, it is nothing with thee to help whether with many, or with them
   that have no power: help us, O Lord our God! for we rest on thee, and
   in thy name we go against this multitudes"
   (1 Chronicles 14:11.)

   The same Spirit who inspired that pious king with such invincible
   fortitude dictated this psalm for the benefit of the whole Church, to
   encourage her with unhesitating confidence to betake herself to God for
   aid. And in our own day he sets before us these words, in order that no
   danger or difficulty may prevent us from calling upon God. When the
   whole world may conspire together against us, we have as it were a wall
   of brass for the defense of Christ's kingdom in these words, "Why do
   the heathen rage?" etc., (Psalm 2:1.)

   It will be in no small degree profitable to us to contemplate this as
   an example in which we have represented to us, as in a mirror what has
   been the lot of the Church of God from the beginning. This, if rightly
   reflected upon, will keep us at the present day from being unduly
   dejected when we witness the whole world in array against us. We see
   how the Pope has inflamed the whole world against us with diabolical
   rage. Hence it is, that in whatever direction we turn our eyes, we meet
   with just so many hostile armies to destroy us. But when we have once
   arrived at a settled persuasion that no strange thing happens to us,
   the contemplation of the condition of the Church in old time will
   strengthen us for continuing in the exercise of patience until God
   suddenly display his power, which is perfectly able, without any
   created aid, to frustrate all the attempts of the world.

   To remove from the minds of the godly all misgivings as to whether help
   is ready to be imparted to them from heaven, the prophet distinctly
   affirms that those who molest the Church are chargeable with making war
   against God, who has taken her under his protection. The principle upon
   which God declares that he will be our helper is contained in these
   words,

   "He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye,"
   (Zechariah 2:8.)

   And what is said in another psalm concerning the patriarchs, is equally
   applicable to all true believers,

   "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm,"
   (Psalm 105:15.)

   He will have the anointing with which he has anointed us to be, as it
   were, a buckler to keep us in perfect safety. The nations here
   enumerated did not avowedly make war against him; but as, when he sees
   his servants unrighteously assaulted, he interposes himself between
   them and their enemies to bear the blows aimed at them, they are here
   justly represented as having entered into a league against God The case
   is analogous to that of the Papists in the present day. If any were to
   ask them, when they hold consultations for the express purpose of
   accomplishing our destruction, Whether they were stronger than God?
   they would immediately reply, That they had no intention whatever of
   assaulting heaven in imitation of the giants of old. But God having
   declared that every injury which is done to us is an assault upon him,
   we may, as from a watch-tower, behold in the distance by the eye of
   faith the approach of that destruction of which the votaries of
   Antichrist shall have at length the sad and melancholy experience.

   The expression, to consult with the heart, is by some explained, to
   deliberate with the greatest exertion and earnestness of mind. Thus it
   is quite common for us to say, that a thing is done with the heart
   which is done with earnestness and ardor of mind. But this expression
   is rather intended to denote the hidden crafty devices complained of a
   little before.

   Some interpreters refer the tents of Edom to warlike furniture, and
   understand the words as meaning, that these enemies came well equipped
   and provided with tents for prolonging the war; but the allusion seems
   rather to be to the custom which prevailed among those nations of
   dwelling in tents. It is, however, a hyperbolical form of expression;
   as if it had been said, So great was their eagerness to engage in this
   war, that they might be said even to pluck their tents from the places
   where they were pitched.

   I do not intend to enter curiously into a discussion concerning the
   respective nations here named, the greater part of them being
   familiarly known from the frequency with which they are spoken of in
   the sacred Scriptures. When it is said that Assur and the rest were an
   arm to the sons of Lot, this is evidently an additional aggravation of
   the wickedness of the sons of Lot. It would have been an act of
   unnatural cruelty for them to have aided foreign nations against their
   own kindred. But when they themselves are the first to sound the
   trumpet, and when of their own suggestion they invite the aid of the
   Assyrians and other nations to destroy their own brethren, ought not
   such barbarous inhumanity to call forth the deepest detestation?
   Josephus himself records, that the Israelites had passed through their
   borders without doing them any harm, sparing their own blood according
   to the express command of God. When the Moabites and Ammonites then
   knew that their brethren the Jews spared them, remembering that they
   were of the same blood, and sprung from one common parentage, ought
   they not also to have reciprocated so much kindness on their part as
   not to have embarked in any hostile enterprise against them? But it is,
   as it were, the destiny of the Church, not only to be assailed by
   external enemies, but to suffer far greater trouble at the hands of
   false brethren. At the present day, none are more furiously mad against
   us than counterfeit Christians.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [434] The Hebrew is vryt ykrtv, berith yichrothu, "they have cut a
   covenant." The verb is from krt, carath, he cut, which, with the noun,
   vryt, berith, signifies to strike a league, or to covenant The phrase
   owes its origin to the custom which prevailed, in ancient times, of
   sacrificing an animal at the forming of solemn leagues, and dividing
   the victim in twain, the contracting parties passing between the two
   pieces; see [16]volume 2, page 264, note. It is then affirmed of these
   combined enemies of the Jews, that they had cut the covenant sacrifice;
   that they had slain a sacrificial victim, divided it in twain, and
   passed between the pieces' thus mutually binding themselves to
   accomplish their hostile purpose.

   [435] That is, the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, (Genesis 25:30.)
   They were a pastoral people, and made great use of tents.

   [436] The Ishmaelites were the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son,
   by Hagar the Egyptian, (Genesis 25:12-18.) They inhabited part of
   Arabia.

   [437] That is, the Moabites, the descendants of Moab, a son of Lot, by
   one of his daughters, (Genesis 19:37.)

   [438] The Hagarenes or Hagarites were the posterity of Abraham by
   Keturah, (who is supposed to have been Hagar,) whom he married after
   Sarah's death. They dwelt on the east of Gilead, in the vicinity of the
   Euphrates. In the days of Saul war was made upon them by the
   Reubenites, who, after having nearly destroyed them and expelled them
   from their country, dwelt in their tents, (1 Chronicles 5:10.) They
   seem again to have recruited their strength; but where they afterwards
   dwelt is not known. "They are probably the same," says Cresswell, "as
   the Saracens."

   [439] Gebal, which signifies a mountain, denotes, according to some,
   the Giblites, who inhabited a district on the Phoenician coast in the
   neighborhood of Tyre. They were a tribe of the Aborigines of Canaan,
   and are mentioned as left by Joshua to be conquered after his death,
   (Joshua 13:5.) They were of considerable service to Hiram, king of
   Tyre, in preparing materials for Solomon's temple, as we learn from 1
   Kings 5:18, where the original word for stone-squarers is hgvlym
   haggibelim, the Giblites; and it would seem from Ezekiel's speaking of
   "the ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof," (Ezekiel 27:9,) that
   they rose to no small degree of eminence. The ruins of an ancient city
   called by the natives Gibyle, situated upon the Mediterranean Sea
   between Tripoli and Sidon, are supposed to be those of the chief city
   of the Giblites. If so, these ruins attest its ancient grandeur to have
   been considerable. Others suppose that Gebal (the Gebalene of the
   Romans) was a mountainous district inhabited by the Edomites, and
   extending from the Dead Sea southward to Selal or Petra. By the Arabs
   it is called Djebal.

   [440] That is, the Ammonites, the descendants of Ammon, another of
   Lot's sons, by one of his daughters, (Genesis 19:38.) They dwelt in
   Arabia Petrea.

   [441] The Amalekites were a powerful people, who dwelt also in Arabia
   Petrea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, or between Havilah and
   Shur, (1 Samuel 15:7,) south of Idumea, and east of the northern part
   of the Red Sea.

   Psalm 83:9-12

   9. Do to them as to the Midianites, [442] as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at
   the brook Kishon. [443] 10. They perished at Endor; they became manure
   for the earth. 11. Make them and their princes like Oreb, and like
   Zeeb; [444] and like Zebah, and like Zalmunna, [445] all their princes.
   12. Who have said, Let us take in possession for ourselves the
   habitations of God.


   9. Do to them as to the Midianites. The faithful, having complained of
   the very grievous oppressions to which they were subjected, with the
   view of inducing God the more readily to succor them, now call to their
   remembrance the many occasions on which he had afforded relief to his
   people, when brought into the most desperate circumstances. From this,
   it is an obvious inference, that God wisely delays his aid to his
   servants under oppression, that when they seem to be reduced to the
   last extremity, he may appear in a miraculous manner for their succor.
   The prophet, in this verse, mingles together two histories. Strict
   accuracy would have required him to have said in one connected
   sentence, Do to them as to the Midianites at the brook Kishon. But he
   inserts in the middle of this sentence, the slaughter of Jabin and
   Sisera. It was, however, of no great importance to distinguish
   particularly between the two histories. He considered it enough for his
   purpose, to bring to the remembrance of himself and other pious Jews,
   the miracles which God in the days of old had so often wrought in
   delivering his people. The great object aimed at is to show, that God,
   who had so often put his enemies to flight, and rescued his poor
   trembling sheep out of the jaws of wolves, was not now without the
   power of effecting the same deliverance. The wonderful manner in which
   he succoured his people by the hand of Gideon is well known: Judges 6
   and 7; It might have seemed altogether ridiculous for Gideon to venture
   to engage in battle against a very powerful army, with no greater a
   number of men of war than three hundred, and these, be it observed,
   such as had been in a state of bondage during their whole lives, and
   whom the mere look of their lords might have thrown into consternation.
   And yet, it came to pass, that the Midianites perished by turning their
   swords against each other. The same goodness God displayed in the
   slaughter of Sisera and king Jabin, Judges 4:13. Barak, under the
   conduct of a woman, Deborah, discomfited them both, when, with a small
   handful of soldiers, he intrepidly gave battle to their mighty host.
   And Sisera, the general of the army, did not die bravely on the field
   of battle, but was smitten by the hand of a woman after he had retired
   to some hiding-place. That the faithful may not be overwhelmed with
   terror and fall into despair, they seasonably fortify themselves with
   these examples of deliverance, by which God had shown that in himself
   alone there resides a sufficiency of power to defend his people,
   whenever, destitute of the resources of human aid, they should betake
   themselves to him. From that astonishing and unwonted mode of granting
   deliverance, they came to the conclusion, that he is a wonderful worker
   in preserving his Church; in order to encourage themselves to entertain
   the fullest confidence, that in his breath alone they would have
   sufficient strength to overthrow all their enemies. Nor is it only in
   this passage that the slaughter of the Midianites is related for this
   purpose. Isaiah also (Isaiah 9:4) introduces it for confirming the
   truth of the Church's restitution: "For thou hast broken the yoke of
   his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as
   in the day of Midian." When it is stated that they became manure for
   the earth, the expression may be explained as meaning, either, first,
   that their carcases lay rotting upon the earth; or, secondly, that they
   were trampled under foot as manure. This latter exposition is the most
   appropriate; but I do not reject the former. The reason why it is said,
   They perished at Endor, it is somewhat difficult to ascertain. The
   name, Endor, is to be found in Joshua 17:11; and it is probable, that
   the army of king Jabin was destroyed there. [446] The opinion
   entertained by some, that Endor is here used as an appellative,
   conveying the idea that their discomfiture was open and visible to the
   eye, is what I cannot approve.

   12. Who have said, Let us take in possession for ourselves the
   habitations of God. These heathen enemies are again accused of treason
   against the King of heaven, in seizing upon his heritage like lawless
   robbers. They would not, we may be sure, avow in so many words that it
   was their intention to commit such a crime; but as they despised God,
   who, as they well knew, was worshipped by the people of Israel, they
   are here justly charged with the guilt of endeavoring to dispossess Him
   of his own inheritance. And, without doubt, they profanely poured abuse
   upon the true God, of whose sacred majesty they entertained the
   greatest contempt, their minds being besotted with their own
   inventions. But even granting that they abstained from gross
   blasphemies, yet whatever harassing proceedings are carried on against
   the godly redound to the dishonor of God, who has taken them under his
   protection. The appellation, the habitations or mansions of God, which
   is applied to Judea, is a form of expression, containing no small
   degree of comfort. God has united himself to us, with the view of
   having an everlasting residence amongst us, or rather that he may set
   as high a value upon his Church, and account it as precious, as a
   householder does his possessions which are most valuable, and yield him
   a large revenue.

   Psalm 83:13-18

   13. O my God! make them like a whirling ball, [447] like stubble before
   the wind. 14. As fire burns a forest [448] and as the flame kindles the
   mountains, [449] 15. So pursue them with thy tempest, [450] and terrify
   them with thy whirlwind. 16. Fill their faces with shame; that they may
   seek thy name, O Jehovah! 17. Let them be ashamed, and terrified
   perpetually, and let them be confounded, and perish. 18. And let them
   know that thou art, thy name Jehovah, thou alone the Most High over all
   the earth. [451]


   13. O my God! make them like a whirling ball. As the ungodly, when they
   gird and prepare themselves for destroying the Church, are usually
   inflated with intolerable pride, the inspired bard beseeches God to put
   them to shame, it being impossible to abate their pride until they are
   laid prostrate, confounded, and shamefully disappointed. When he
   declares (verse 16) that, as the result of this, they will seek the
   name of God, he is not to be understood as speaking of their being
   brought to true repentance, or of their genuine conversion. I indeed
   admit that the first step to genuine repentance is when men, brought
   low by affliction, willingly humble themselves. But what is here meant
   is nothing more than a forced and slavish submission like that of
   Pharaoh, king of Egypt. It is a case of frequent occurrence for the
   wicked, when subdued by adversity, to give glory to God, for a short
   period. But they are soon again carried away with a frantic madness,
   which clearly discovers their hypocrisy, and brings to light the pride
   and rebellion which lurked in their hearts. What the prophet desires
   is, that the wicked may be compelled by stripes to acknowledge God,
   whether they will or no, in order that their fury, which breaks forth
   because they escape with impunity, may at least be kept under
   restraint. This is more clearly apparent from the 17th verse, where he
   distinctly prays that they may be destroyed for ever; which would not
   at all correspond with his previous statement, were it regarded as a
   prayer for their being brought to repentance. Nor does he needlessly
   heap together such a multiplicity of words. He does this partly because
   the reprobate, though often chastised, are nevertheless so incorrigible
   that ever and anon they are mustering up new strength and courage; and
   partly because there is nothing which it is more difficult to be
   persuaded of than that such as wallow at ease in great outward
   prosperity will soon perish. The cause to which this is to be
   attributed is just our not sufficiently apprehending the dreadful
   character of the vengeance of God which awaits the oppressors of the
   Church.

   18. And let them know that thou art, thy name Jehovah. It is not the
   saving knowledge of God which is here spoken of, but that
   acknowledgement of him which his irresistible power extorts from the
   wicked. It is not simply said that they will know that there is a God;
   but a special kind of knowledge is laid down, it being intimated that
   the heathen who before held the true religion in contempt, would at
   length perceive that the God who made himself known in the Law, and who
   was worshipped in Judea, was the only true God. Still, however, it must
   be remembered, that the knowledge spoken of is only that which is of an
   evanescent character, having neither root nor the living juice to
   nourish it; for the wicked will not submit to God willingly and
   cordially, but are drawn by compulsion to yield a counterfeit
   obedience, or, being restrained by him, dare not break forth into open
   outrage. This, then, is an experimental recognition of God which
   penetrates not to the heart, but is extorted from them by force and
   necessity. The pronoun 'th, atah, thou, is emphatic, implying a tacit
   contrast between the God of Israel and all the false gods which were
   the product of men's invention. The prayer amounts to this: Lord, make
   them to know that the idols which they have fabricated for themselves
   are no gods, and in fact are nothing. The despisers of God may indeed
   shun the light, and at one time may overcast themselves with clouds,
   while at another their may plunge into the deep and thick shades of
   darkness; but He pursues them, and draws them forth to the knowledge of
   himself, which they would fain bury in ignorance. And as the world
   indiscriminately and disgracefully applies his sacred name to its own
   trifling inventions, this profanation is corrected when it is added,
   thy name Jehovah. This implies that being, or really to be, is in the
   strict sense applicable to God alone; for although unbelievers may
   attempt to tear his glory to pieces, he continues perfect and
   unchanged. The contrast of which I have spoken, must be kept in mind by
   the reader. A nation has never existed so barbarous as not to have
   worshipped some deity; but every country forged particular gods for
   itself. And although the Moabites, the Edomites, and the rest of these
   nations, admitted that some power and authority belonged to the God of
   Israel, yet they conceived that this power and authority did not extend
   beyond the boundaries of Judea. Thus the king of Syria called him, "the
   God of the hills," (1 Kings 20:23.) This preposterous and absurd
   division of God's glory, which men make, is disproved by one word, and
   all the superstitions which at that time prevailed in the world are
   overthrown, when the Prophet attributes to the God of Israel, as well
   the essence of Deity as the name; for unless all the idols of the
   heathen are completely abolished, he will not obtain, alone and
   unshared, the name of Jehovah. Accordingly, it is added, Thou alone art
   the Most High over all the earth; a statement which is worthy of our
   most careful attention. The superstitious commonly think it enough to
   leave God his name, that is to say, two or three syllables; and in the
   meantime they fritter away his power, as if his majesty were contained
   in an empty title. Let us then remember that God does not receive that
   honor among men to which he is entitled, if he is not allowed to
   possess his own inherent sovereignty, and if his glory is obscured by
   setting up other objects against him with antagonist claims.

   [447] "Globum," -- Lat "Une boule," -- Fr The word glgl, galeggal, thus

   some light matter, which the wind whirls round and blows away; chaff."
   In that passage of Isaiah, where the same Hebrew word occurs, the

   describe these formidable and alarming fires from personal observation;

   PSALM 84

   The Psalmist complains that nothing proved to him a source of greater
   distress than his being prevented from coming to the tabernacle, and
   his being banished from the assembly of the saints, where God was
   called upon. And yet he shows, that nothing can withstand the longing
   desires of the godly; and that, surmounting all obstacles, they will be
   constantly engaged in seeking God, and, so to speak, will make a way
   for themselves where there is none. [452] At length he expresses his
   desire to be restored to the tabernacle of God, and again testifies
   that a day spent in the tabernacle was in his estimation more to be
   prized [453] than to live for a long time in the society of
   unbelievers.

   To the chief musician upon Gittith. A Psalm of [454] the sons of Korah.
   [455]

   The title of this psalm does not bear the name of David; but as its
   subject-matter is applicable to him, he was in all probability its
   author. Some think that it was composed by the sons of Korah, for his
   particular use; but to prove the groundlessness of this opinion, it is
   only necessary to advert to this one consideration, that David in his
   time was so eminently distinguished by the gift of prophecy as to be
   under no necessity of employing the Levites to perform a service for
   which he himself was so well qualified. The only difficulty to our
   ascribing it to David is, that mention is made of mount Zion, to which
   the ark of the covenant was not brought until he was put in peaceable
   possession of the kingdom. how after that, he was never deprived of the
   liberty of appearing before the ark with others, except once, and then
   only for a short time; namely, when he was under the necessity of
   betaking himself to flight on account of the rebellion raised against
   him by his son Absalom. [456] The contents of the psalm, however,
   indicate, that at the time of its composition, he had been compelled to
   wander long in different places as an exile. If we reflect that David
   recorded in psalms the persecutions he endured under Saul long after he
   was delivered from them, we will not be surprised to find him making
   mention of Zion in connection with them. Of the word Gittith, I have
   already spoken on the eighth psalm.

   Psalm 84:1-4

   1. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of Hosts! 2. My soul
   longeth, [or greatly desireth,] yea, even fainteth after the courts of
   Jehovah: my heart and my flesh leap for joy towards the living God. 3.
   The sparrow also hath found a house for herself, and the swallow [457]
   a nest for herself, where she may place her young ones, O thine altars!
   Thou Jehovah of Hosts! my King, and my God. 4. Blessed are they who
   dwell in thy house: they will be ever praising thee. Selah.


   1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of Hosts! David complains
   of his being deprived of liberty of access to the Church of God, there
   to make a profession of his faith, to improve in godliness, and to
   engage in the divine worship. Some would understand by the tabernacles
   of God, the kingdom of heaven, as if David mourned over his continuance
   in this state of earthly pilgrimage; but they do not sufficiently
   consider the nature of his present afflicted circumstances -- that he
   was debarred from the sanctuary. He knew that God had not in vain
   appointed the holy assemblies, and that the godly have need of such
   helps so long as they are sojourners in this world. He was also deeply
   sensible of his own infirmity; nor was he ignorant how far short he
   came of approaching the perfection of angels. He had therefore good
   ground to lament over his being deprived of those means, the utility of
   which is well known to all true believers. His attention was, no doubt,
   directed to the proper end for which the external ritual was appointed;
   for his character was widely different from that of hypocrites, who,
   while they frequent the solemn assemblies with great pomp, and seem to
   burn with ardent zeal in serving God, yet in all this, aim at nothing
   more than by an ostentatious display of piety to obtain the credit of
   having performed their duty towards Him. David's mind was far from
   being occupied with this gross imagination. The end he had in view in
   desiring so earnestly to enjoy free access to the sanctuary was, that
   he might there worship God with sincerity of heart, and in a spiritual
   manner. The opening words are in the form of an exclamation, which is
   an indication of ardent affection; and this state of feeling is
   expressed still more fully in the second verse. Hence we learn, that
   those are sadly deficient in understanding who carelessly neglect God's
   instituted worship, as if they were able to mount up to heaven by their
   own unaided efforts.

   I have observed, that in the second verse a more than ordinary ardor of
   desire is expressed. The first verb, ksph, casaph, signifies vehemently
   to desire; but not contented with this word, David adds, that his soul
   fainteth after the courts of the Lord, which is equivalent to our
   pining away, when, under the influence of extreme mental emotion, we
   are in a manner transported out of ourselves. He speaks only of the
   courts of the tabernacle, because, not being a priest, it was not
   lawful for him to go beyond the outer court. None but the priests, as
   is well known, were permitted to enter into the inner sanctuary. In the
   close of the verse, he declares, that this longing extended itself even
   to his body, that is, it manifested itself in the utterance of the
   mouth, the languor of the eyes, and the action of the hands. The reason
   why he longed so intensely to have access to the tabernacle was, to
   enjoy the living God; not that he conceived of God as shut up in so
   narrow a place as was the tent of the ark, [458] but he was convinced
   of the need he had of steps, by which to rise up to heaven, and knew
   that the visible sanctuary served the purpose of a ladder, because, by
   it the minds of the godly were directed and conducted to the heavenly
   model. And assuredly, when we consider that the sluggishness of our
   flesh hinders us from elevating our minds to the height of the divine
   majesty, in vain would God call us to himself, did he not at the same
   time, on his part, come down to us; or, did he not at least, by the
   interposition of means, stretch out his hand to us, so to speak, in
   order to lift us up to himself.

   3 The sparrow also hath found a house for herself, and the swallow a
   nest for herself. Some read this verse as one continuous sentence,
   conveying the idea that the birds made their nests near the altars;
   [459] from which it might the more evidently appear how hard and
   distressing his condition was in being kept at a distance from them.
   This opinion seems to be supported from the circumstance, that
   immediately before the Hebrew word for altars, there is the particle
   't, eth, which is commonly joined with the accusative case. But as it
   is also sometimes used in exclamations, the prophet, I have no doubt,
   breaking off in the middle of his sentence all at once, exclaims, that
   nothing would be more grateful to him than to behold the altar of God.
   David then, in the first place, with the view of aggravating the misery
   of his condition, compares himself with the sparrows and swallows,
   showing how hard a case it was for the children of Abraham to be driven
   out of the heritage which had been promised them, whilst the little
   birds found some place or other for building their nests. He might
   sometimes find a comfortable retreat, and might even dwell among
   unbelievers with some degree of honor and state; but so long as he was
   deprived of liberty of access to the sanctuary, he seemed to himself to
   be in a manner banished from the whole world. Undoubtedly, the proper
   end which we ought to propose to ourselves in living, is to be engaged
   in the service of God. The manner in which he requires us to serve him
   is spiritual; but still it is necessary for us to make use of those
   external aids which he has wisely appointed for our observance. This is
   the reason why David all at once breaks forth into the exclamation, O
   thine altars! thou Jehovah of Hosts! Some might be ready to say in
   reference to his present circumstances, that there were many retreats
   in the world, where he might live in safety and repose, yea, that there
   were many who would gladly receive him as a guest under their roof, and
   that therefore he had no cause to be so greatly distressed. To this he
   answers, that he would rather relinquish the whole world than continue
   in a state of exclusion from the holy tabernacle; that he felt no place
   delightful at a distance from God's altars; and, in short, that no
   dwelling-place was agreeable to him beyond the limits of the Holy Land.
   This he would intimate, by the appellations which he gives to God, My
   King, and my God. In speaking thus, he gives us to understand that his
   life was uncomfortable and embittered, because he was banished from the
   kingdom of God. "Although all men," as if he had said, "should vie with
   each other in their eagerness to afford me shelter and entertainment,
   yet as thou art my King, what pleasure would it afford me to live in
   the world, so long as I am excluded from the territory of the Holy
   Land? And again, as thou art my God, for what end do I live but to seek
   after thee? Now, when thou castest me off, should I not despise every
   place of retreat and shelter which is offered me, however pleasant and
   delightful it may be to my flesh?"

   4 Blessed are they who dwell in thy house. Here the Psalmist expresses
   more distinctly the proper and legitimate use of the sanctuary; and
   thus he distinguishes himself from hypocrites, who are sedulously
   attentive to the observance of outward ceremonies, but destitute of
   genuine heart godliness. David, on the contrary, testifies, that the
   true worshippers of God offer to him the sacrifice of praise, which can
   never be dissociated from faith. Never will a man praise God from the
   heart, unless, relying upon his grace, he is a partaker of spiritual
   peace and joy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [457] Bochart supposes drvr, to signify not the swallow, but some kind
   of wild dove; as he observes, that the Æthiopic version renders it the
   ring-dove, and the Septuagint, Vulgate, Chaldee, Syriac, and other
   ancient versions, the turtle These last probably render it turtle from
   the resemblance of the name to tvr, tur, the common name of that bird.
   Merrick, in his version, translated it at first turtle, but afterwards
   substituted the more comprehensive name of dove instead of turtle, at
   the suggestion of Dr Lowth. "You have very good authorities for the
   turtle," says that learned Prelate: "my objection may be merely an
   English one. The bird which we know by that name is of all others the
   most retired and shyest; and hardly ever approaches any building, much
   less makes her nest in any frequented place. Does not this
   consideration render it an unfit image for the Psalmist's purpose here?
   The dove, which is only a more general name for the same bird, would
   not be liable to this objection." But to remove that difficulty
   relating to the turtle, Merrick quotes a passage from Sir H. Blunt's
   Voyage to the Levant, (page 186, ed. 5) in which that traveler says,
   that in Turkey, all birds are so tame from not being used to violence,
   that he had thrown his coat upon turtle-doves in the highway. "The
   Hebrew interpreters," says the Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible,
   "believe it is the swallow, and are followed by our version. The word
   means freedom, deliverance, and may be supposed to refer to the free
   manner in which the swallow flies. It is only mentioned again, at least
   by this name, in Proverbs 26:2; and is there also associated with the
   tsippor, which our version there renders bird, instead of sparrow In
   both texts, the meaning agrees better with the swallow than the
   turtle-dove."

   [458] "Comme estort le pavillon de l'Arche." -- Fr.

   [459] This is the sense given in our English Bible; to the accuracy of
   which Dr Adam Clarke objects. "It is very unlikely," says he, "that
   sparrows and swallows, or birds of any kind, should be permitted to
   build their nests, and hatch their young, in or about altars, which
   were kept in a state of the greatest purity, and where perpetual fires
   were kept for the purpose of sacrifice, burning incense, etc." He
   proposes to read the words beginning at the third verse and ending with
   her young ones, within a parenthesis, and to explain the remaining part
   of the verse as the conclusion of the sentence commencing at verse 2d;
   or to read the parenthesis as the close of verse 3d: "Even the sparrow
   hath found out a house, and the swallow (ring-dove) a nest for herself,
   where she may lay her young; but I have no place either of rest or
   worship." But though it cannot be reasonably supposed that these birds
   would be permitted to nestle about the altar itself, before which the
   priests were continually serving; yet it is not improbable that they
   were permitted to construct their nests in the houses near the altar.
   "The altar," says Dr Paxton, "is here by a synecdoche of a part for the
   whole, to be understood of the tabernacle, among the rafters of which,
   the sparrow and the swallow were allowed to nestle; or rather for the
   buildings which surrounded the sacred edifice where the priests and
   their assistants had their ordinary residence." -- Paxton's
   Illustrations of Scripture, volume 2, pages 310, 355. Dr Morison, after
   quoting the criticism of Dr Clarke, observes, "I confess I see a great
   beauty in adhering to the sense given in the common version. Though the
   sparrow and ring-dove are represented as finding a nest for themselves
   at the altars of the sanctuary, it does not follow that the inspired
   writer intends any thing more than that, while he was exiled from the
   house of his God, these familiar birds had a home near that sacred spot
   where he had associated his chief joys." Parkhurst considers, that a
   comparison is intended; and that though the particles of similitude
   "as" and "so" are not in the Hebrew text, they are to be understood.
   And in the Hebrew Scriptures, there are many instances in which they
   are omitted, but where it is necessary to supply them to make an
   intelligible version. He translates as follows: "Even (as) the sparrow
   findeth her house, and the dove her nest, where she hath laid her
   young, (so, should I find,) thy altars, O Jehovah of Hosts! my King,
   and my God." According to this exposition, the Psalmist illustrates his
   vehement longing after the sacred tabernacle, and God's public worship,
   by the natural affection of birds, and by that joy and delight with
   which they return to their brood after they have been absent from them.
   (See Parkhurst's Lexicon on drr,2.) Walford takes the same view. His
   version is: -- "As the sparrow findeth a house, and the swallow a nest,
   Where she may place her offspring,
   So may thy altars be my abode, O Jehovah of Hosts!
   My King, and my God."

   Psalm 84:5-7

   5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; the ways are in their
   hearts. 6. They passing through the valley of weeping, [460] will
   together make it a fountain; [461] the rain also will cover the
   cisterns, [or reservoirs.] [462] 7. They will go from strength to
   strength; [463] the God of gods will be seen in Zion.


   5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee. David again informs us,
   that the purpose for which he desired liberty of access to the
   sanctuary was, not merely to gratify his eyes with what was to be seen
   there, but to make progress in faith. To lean with the whole heart upon
   God, is to attain to no ordinary degree of advancement: and this cannot
   be attained by any man, unless all his pride is laid prostrate in the
   dust, and his heart truly humbled. In proposing to himself this way of
   seeking God, David's object is to borrow from him by prayer the
   strength of which he feels himself to be destitute. The concluding
   clause of the verse, the ways are in their hearts, [464] is by some
   interpreted as meaning, That those are happy who walk in the way which
   God has appointed; for nothing is more injurious to a man than to trust
   in his own understanding. It is not improperly said of the law, "This
   is the way, walk ye in it," Isaiah 30:21. Whenever then men turn aside,
   however little it may be, from the divine law, they go astray, and
   become entangled in perverse errors. But it is more appropriate to
   restrict the clause to the scope of the passage, and to understand it
   as implying, that those are happy whose highest ambition it is to have
   God as the guide of their life, and who therefore desire to draw near
   to him. God, as we have formerly observed, is not satisfied with mere
   outward ceremonies. What he desires is, to rule and keep in subjection
   to himself all whom he invites to his tabernacle. Whoever then has
   learned how great a blessedness it is to rely upon God, will put forth
   all the desires and faculties of his mind, that with all speed he may
   hasten to Him.

   6 They passing through the valley of weeping, will together make it a
   well. The meaning of the Psalmist is, that no impediments can prevent
   the enlightened and courageous worshippers of God from making
   conscience of waiting upon the sanctuary. By this manner of speaking,
   he confirms the statement which he had previously made, That nothing is
   more desirable than to be daily engaged in the worship of God; showing,
   as he does, that no difficulties can put a stop to the ardent longings
   of the godly, and prevent them from hastening with alacrity, yea, even
   though their way should be through dry and barren deserts, to meet
   together to solemnise the holy assemblies. As the Hebrew word hvch',
   habbacha, when the final letter is h, he, signifies tears, and when the
   final letter is ', aleph, a mulberry tree, some here read valley of
   tears, and others, valley of the mulberry. The majority of interpreters
   adopt the first reading; but the other opinion is not destitute of
   probability. [465] There is, however, no doubt, that dry and barren
   deserts are here to be understood, in travelling through which, much
   difficulty and privation must be endured, particularly from the want of
   water; drink being of all other articles the most necessary to persons
   when travelling. David intended this as an argument to prove the
   steadfastness of the godly, whom the scarcity of water, which often
   discourages travelers from prosecuting their journey, will not hinder
   from hastening to seek God, though their way should be through sandy
   and and vales. In these words, reproof is administered to the
   slothfulness of those who will not submit to any inconvenience for the
   sake of being benefited by the service of God. They indulge themselves
   in their own ease and pleasures, and allow nothing to interfere with
   these. They will, therefore, provided they are not required to make any
   exertion or sacrifice, readily profess themselves to be the servants of
   God; but they would not give a hair of their head, or make the smallest
   sacrifice, to obtain the liberty of hearing the gospel preached, and of
   enjoying the sacraments. This slothful spirit, as is evident from daily
   observation, keeps multitudes fast bound to their nests, so that they
   cannot bear to forego in any degree their own ease and convenience.
   Yea, even in those places where they are summoned by the sound of the
   church-bell to public prayers [466] to hear the doctrine of salvation,
   or to partake of the holy mysteries, we see that some give themselves
   to sleep, some think only of gain, some are entangled with the affairs
   of the world, and others are engaged in their amusements. It is
   therefore not surprising, if those who live at a distance, and who
   cannot enjoy these religious services and means of salvation, without
   making some sacrifice of their worldly substance, remain lolling at
   home. That such may not live secure and self-satisfied in the enjoyment
   of outward prosperity, David declares, that those who have true heart
   religion, and who sincerely serve God, direct their steps to the
   sanctuary of God, not only when the way is easy and cheerful, under the
   shade and through delightful paths, but also when they must walk
   through rugged and barren deserts; and that they will rather make for
   themselves cisterns with immense toil, than be prevented from
   prosecuting their journey by reason of the drought of the country.

   7 They will go from strength to strength. In this verse the same
   sentiment is repeated. Mount Zion being the place where, according to
   the appointment of the law, the holy assemblies were observed, after
   the ark of the covenant was removed thither, it is said, that the
   people of God will come to Zion in great numbers, provoking one another
   to this good work. [467] The word chyl, chayil, seldom signifies a
   troop, or band of men, but most commonly power, or strength. It will
   therefore be more in accordance with the ordinary use of the term, to
   translate, They will go from strength to strength; [468] implying, that
   the saints are continually acquiring fresh strength for going up to
   mount Zion, and continue to prosecute their journey without weariness
   or fatigue, until they reach the wished-for place, and behold the
   countenance of God. If the word troop is preferred, the meaning will
   be, that not a few only will come, but numerous companies. The manner
   in which God manifested himself to his servants in the temple in old
   time, we have spoken of elsewhere, and especially on the 27th psalm, at
   the 4th and 5th verses. No visible image of God was there to be seen;
   but the ark of the covenant was a symbol of his presence, and genuine
   worshippers found from experience, that by this means they were greatly
   aided in approaching him.

   that travel the roads with their hearts. In the valley of Baca he
   maketh it a fountain; even Moreh is clothed with ponds. They walk from

   first word of the 6th, (so the Seventy direct, and the sense seems to
   require,) with a slight alteration into vrv; the change of number, I
   have often observed, is not to be regarded. How happy the man that
   feels himself invigorated by thee; that travels the roads that lead to
   Jerusalem, with full bent of heart! He goes through the valley of Baca
   as full of spirit as if it was cheered with a fountain of waters, and
   Moreh, as if it was filled with delicious ponds.' (Two desolate places

   Psalm 84:8-11

   8. O Jehovah, God of Hosts! hear my prayer: O God of Jacob! hearken.
   Selah. 9. O God! our shield, behold; and look upon the face of thy
   Anointed. 10. For better is one day in thy courts than a thousand
   elsewhere. [469] I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God,
   than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 11. For Jehovah God is our sun
   and shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory: he will withhold no good
   thing from those who walk uprightly. O Jehovah of Hosts! blessed is the
   man who trusteth in thee.


   8 O Jehovah, God of Hosts! hear my prayer. David, instead of acting
   like worldly men, who foolishly and unprofitably distress and torment
   themselves by inwardly cherishing their desires, very wisely directs
   his wishes and prayers to God. From this it is also evident, that he
   was not accustomed to indulge in ostentatious boasting, as is the case
   with many hypocrites, who present to outward appearance a wonderful
   ardor of zeal, while yet the omniscient eye of God sees nothing but
   coldness in their hearts. In the first place, he supplicates in
   general, that God would vouchsafe to hear him. He next anticipates a
   temptation which might very readily arise from his being at present
   apparently cut off from the Church, and wards it off, by associating
   and ranking himself with all true believers, under the protection of
   God. Had he not been a member of the Church, he could not have said
   generally, and as it were in the person of all its members, Our shield.
   Having made this statement, he uses language still more expressive of
   high privilege, adducing the royal anointing with which God had honored
   him by the hand of Samuel, 1 Samuel 16:12. These words, Look upon the
   face of thy anointed, are very emphatic, and yet many interpreters pass
   over them very frigidly. He encourages himself in the hope of obtaining
   the favor of God, from the consideration that he had been anointed king
   in compliance with a divine command. Knowing, however, that his kingdom
   was merely a shadow and type of something more illustrious, there is no
   doubt, that in uttering these words, the object which he aspired after
   was, to obtain the divine favor through the intervention of the
   Mediator of whom he was a type. I am personally unworthy, as if he had
   said, that thou shouldest restore me, but the anointing by which thou
   hast made me a type of the only Redeemer will secure this blessing for
   me. We are thus taught, that the only way in which God becomes
   reconciled to us is through the mediation of Christ, whose presence
   scatters and dissipates all the dark clouds of our sins.

   10. For better is one day in thy courts than a thousand elsewhere.
   Unlike the greater part of mankind, who desire to live without knowing
   why, wishing simply that their life may be prolonged, David here
   testifies, not only that the end which he proposed to himself in living
   was to serve God, but that in addition to this, he set a higher value
   on one day which he could spend in the divine service, than upon a long
   time passed among the men of the world, from whose society true
   religion is banished. It being lawful for none but the priests to enter
   into the inner and innermost courts of the temple, David expressly
   declares, that provided he were permitted to have a place at the porch,
   he would be contented with this humble station; for the Hebrew word
   sph, saph, signifies a door-post, or the threshold of a house. [470]
   The value which he set upon the sanctuary is presented in a very
   striking light by the comparison, that he would prefer having a place
   at the very doors of the temple, to his having full possession of the
   tents of wickedness, the plain import of which is, that he would rather
   be cast into a common and unhonoured place, provided he were among the
   people of God, than exalted to the highest rank of honor among
   unbelievers. A rare example of godliness indeed! Many are to be found
   who desire to occupy a place in the Church, but such is the sway which
   ambition has over the minds of men, that very few are content to
   continue among the number of the common and undistinguished class.
   Almost all are carried away with the frantic desire of rising to
   distinction, and can never think of being at ease until they have
   attained to some station of eminence.

   11. Jehovah God is our sun and shield. The idea conveyed by the
   comparison derived from the sun is, that as the sun by his light
   vivifies, nourishes, and rejoices the world, so the benign countenance
   of God fills with joy the hearts of his people, or rather, that they
   neither live nor breathe except in so far as he shines upon them. By
   the term shield is meant, that our salvation, which would otherwise be
   perilled by countless dangers, is in perfect safety under his
   protection. The favor of God in communicating life to us would be far
   from adequate to the exigencies of our condition, unless at the same
   time, in the midst of so many dangers, he interposed his power as a
   buckler to defend us. The sentence immediately succeeding, he will give
   grace and glory, might be viewed as meaning, that those whom God has
   distinguished by his grace in this world, will at length be crowned
   with everlasting glory in his heavenly kingdom. But this distinction
   between grace and glory being, I am afraid, too refined, it will be
   preferable to explain the sentence as implying, that after God has once
   taken the faithful into his favor, he will advance them to high honor,
   and never cease to enrich them with his blessings. [471] This
   interpretation is confirmed by the following clause, He will withhold
   no good thing from those who walk uprightly, obviously teaching us,
   that God's bounty can never be exhausted, but flows without
   intermission. We learn from these words, that whatever excellence may
   be in us proceeds solely from the grace of God. They contain, at the
   same time, this special mark, by which the genuine worshippers of God
   may be distinguished from others, That their life is framed and
   regulated according to the principles of strict integrity.

   The exclamation with which David concludes the psalm, Blessed is the
   man who trusteth in thee, seems to refer to the season of his
   banishment. He had previously described the blessedness of those who
   dwell in the courts of the Lord, and now he avows, that although he was
   for a time deprived of that privilege, he was far from being altogether
   miserable, because he was supported by the best of all consolations,
   that which arose from beholding from a distance the grace of God. This
   is an example well worthy of special attention. So long as we are
   deprived of God's benefits, we must necessarily groan and be sad in
   heart. But, that the sense of our distresses may not overwhelm us, we
   ought to impress it upon our minds, that even in the midst of our
   calamities we do not cease to be happy, when faith and patience are in
   exercise.

   [469] And therefore the verb hstvphph, histopheph, derived from this
   noun, signifies to sit at the threshold

   [470] This explanation is adopted by Walford, who reads, "Jehovah
   giveth favor and honor." "The common gloss on these words," he
   observes, "is, that God first bestows grace on earth, and then glory in
   heaven. But this is an interpretation of the ear rather than of the
   understanding. The writer is evidently speaking of the present happy
   consequences of walking uprightly as he immediately says. The judgment
   of Calvin agrees with this statement."

   [471] "It is generally agreed, that the subject of this psalm is the
   return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity; in celebrating which,
   the Psalmist is carried by a prophetic impulse to foretell a much
   greater deliverance by the coming of Christ." -- Dimock.

   PSALM 85

   God having afflicted his people with new troubles and calamities, after
   their return from their captivity in Babylon, they, in the first place,
   make mention of their deliverance as an argument why he should not
   leave unfinished the work of his grace. Then they complain of the long
   continuance of their afflictions. And, in the third place, inspired
   with hope and confidence, they triumph in the blessedness promised
   them; for their restoration to their own country was connected with the
   kingdom of Christ, from which they anticipated an abundance of all good
   things. [472]

   To the chief musician, a Psalm of the sons of Korah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 85:1-4

   1. O Jehovah! thou hast been favorable to thy land: thou hast brought
   back the captivity of Jacob. 2. Thou hast taken away the iniquity [473]
   of thy people: thou hast covered all their sins. Selah. 3. Thou hast
   turned away all thy anger: thou hast drawn back the fury of thy
   indignation. 4. Turn us, O God of our salvation! and cause thy anger
   against us to cease.


   1 O Jehovah! thou hast been favorable to thy land. Those who translate
   these words in the future tense, in my opinion, mar their meaning. This
   psalm, it is probable, was endited to be sung by the people when they
   were persecuted by the cruel tyranny of Antiochus; and from the
   deliverance wrought for them in the past, they were encouraged to
   expect in the future, fresh and continued tokens of the divine favor,
   -- God having thereby testified, that their sins, however numerous and
   aggravated, could not efface from his memory the remembrance of his
   covenant, so as to render him inexorable towards the children of
   Abraham, and deaf to their prayers. [474] Had they not previously
   experienced such remarkable proofs of the divine goodness, they must
   necessarily have been overwhelmed with the load of their present
   afflictions, especially when so long protracted. The cause of their
   deliverance from captivity they attribute to the free love with which
   God had embraced the land which he had chosen for himself. Whence it
   follows, that the course of his favor was unintermitted; and the
   faithful also were inspired with confidence in prayer, by the
   reflection that, mindful of his choice, he had shown himself merciful
   to his own land. We have elsewhere had occasion to remark, that nothing
   contributes more effectually to encourage us to come to the throne of
   grace, than the remembrance of God's former benefits. Our faith would
   immediately succumb under adversity, and sorrow would choke our hearts,
   were we not taught to believe from the experience of the past, that he
   is inclined compassionately to hear the prayers of his servants, and
   always affords them succor when the exigencies of their circumstances
   require it; especially as there remains at all times the same reason
   for continuing his goodness. Thus the prophet happily applies to
   believers of his own day, the benefits which God in old time bestowed
   upon their fathers, because both they and their fathers were called to
   the hope of the same inheritance.

   2 Thou hast taken away the iniquity of thy people. It was very natural
   for the faithful to feel alarmed and perplexed on account of their
   sins, and therefore the prophet removes all ground for overwhelming
   apprehension, by showing them, that God, in delivering his people, had
   given an irrefragable proof of free forgiveness. He had before traced
   this deliverance to the mere good pleasure and free grace of God as its
   source; but after it was wrought, the iniquities of the people having
   separated between them and their God, and estranged them from him, it
   was necessary that the remedy of pardon should be brought to their aid.
   In saying that their iniquities were taken away, he does not refer to
   the faithful being reformed and purged from their sins, in other words,
   to that work by which God, sanctifying them by the Spirit of
   regeneration, actually removes sin from them. What he intended to say
   he explains immediately after. The amount, in short, is, that God was
   reconciled to the Jews by not imputing their sins to them. When God is
   said to cover sins, the meaning is, that he buries them, so that they
   come not into judgment, as we have shown more at large on the 32nd
   psalm, at the beginning. When, therefore, he had punished the sins of
   his people by captivity, it being his will to restore them again to
   their own country, he removed the great impediment to this, by blotting
   out their transgressions; for deliverance from punishment depends upon
   the remission of sin. Thus we are furnished with an argument in
   confutation of that foolish conceit of the Sophists, which they set
   forth as some great mystery, That God retains the punishment although
   he forgive the fault; whereas God announces in every part of his word,
   that his object in pardoning is, that being pacified, he may at the
   same time mitigate the punishment. Of this we have an additional
   confirmation in the following verse, where we are informed, that God
   was mercifully inclined towards his people, that he might withdraw his
   hand from chastising them. What answer in any degree plausible can be
   given to this by the Sophists, who affirm that God would not be
   righteous did he not, after he had forgiven the fault, execute
   punishment according to the strict demands of his justice? The sequence
   of the pardon of sin is, that God by his blessing testifies that he is
   no longer displeased.

   4 Turn us, O God of our salvation! The faithful now make a practical
   application to themselves, in their present circumstances, of what they
   had rehearsed before concerning God's paternal tenderness towards his
   people whom he had redeemed. And they attribute to him, by whom they
   desire to be restored to their former state, the appellation, O God of
   our salvation! to encourage themselves, even in the most desperate
   circumstances, in the hope of being delivered by the power of God.
   Although to the eye of sense and reason there may be no apparent ground
   to hope favourably as to our condition, it becomes us to believe that
   our salvation rests secure in his hand, and that, whenever he pleases,
   he can easily and readily find the means of bringing salvation to us.
   God's anger being the cause and origin of all calamities, the faithful
   beseech him to remove it. This order demands our special attention; for
   so effeminate and faint-hearted in bearing adversity are we, that no
   sooner does God begin to smite us with his little finger, than we
   entreat him, with groaning and lamentable cries, to spare us. But we
   forget to plead, what should chiefly engage our thoughts, that he would
   deliver us from guilt and condemnation; and we forget this because we
   are reluctant to descend into our own hearts and to examine ourselves.

   Psalm 85:5-8

   5. Wilt thou be wroth against us for ever? wilt thou prolong thy
   displeasure from age to age? 6. Wilt thou not turn again and quicken
   us? and thy people will rejoice in thee. 7. Show us thy mercy, O
   Jehovah! and grant us thy salvation. 8. I will hear what God Jehovah
   will speak: surely he will speak peace to his people and to his meek
   ones, and they will not turn again to folly.


   5 Wilt thou be wroth against us for ever? Here the godly bewail the
   long continuance of their afflictions, and derive an argument in prayer
   from the nature of God, as it is described in the law, --

   "The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and
   abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
   iniquity, and transgression, and sin,"
   (Exodus 34:6, 7,)

   -- a truth which has also been brought under our notice in Psalm 30:5,
   "For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may
   endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning." It thus becomes us,
   when we engage in prayer, to meditate upon the Divine promises that we
   may be furnished with suitable expressions. It may seem, at first view,
   that these devout Jews find fault with God, as if he exhibited his
   character to them in a light very different from that in which he was
   wont to exhibit it; but the object they had in view undoubtedly was to
   obtain, in the struggle they were resolutely maintaining against
   temptation, hope of relief from the contemplation of the nature of God;
   as if they laid it down as a fixed principle, that it is impossible for
   Him to be angry for ever. We may observe, by the way, that it is
   evident, from their praying in this manner, that they were weighed down
   with such an oppressive load of calamities, as to be almost unable any
   longer to endure them. Let us therefore learn, that although God may
   not immediately grant us manifest tokens of his returning favor, yet we
   must not cease to persevere in earnest prayer. If it is objected, that
   then God has promised in vain that his anger would be of short
   duration, I answer, that if we entertain suitable views of our own
   sins, his anger will assuredly appear to be always of short
   continuance; and if we call to remembrance the everlasting course of
   his mercy, we will confess that his anger endures but for a moment. As
   our corrupt nature is ever relapsing into the wanton indulgence of its
   native propensities, manifold corrections are indispensably necessary
   to subdue it thoroughly.

   The godly, still dwelling on the same theme, ask, in the 6th verse,
   whether God will not turn again and quicken them Being fully convinced
   of the truth of this principle, That the punishments with which God
   chastises his children are only temporary; they thereby encourage
   themselves in the confident expectation, that although he may be now
   justly displeased, and may have turned away his face from them, yet,
   when they implore his mercy, he will be entreated, and raising the dead
   to life again, will turn their mourning into gladness. By the word
   quicken, they complain that they almost resemble persons who are dead,
   or that they are stunned and laid prostrate with afflictions. And when
   they promise themselves matter of rejoicing, they intimate that in the
   meantime they are well nigh worn out with sorrow.

   7. Show us thy mercy, O Jehovah! In these words there is the same
   contrast as in the preceding sentence. In supplicating that mercy may
   be extended to them, and deliverance granted them, they confess that
   they are deprived of all sense of both these blessings. Such having
   been the state of the saints in old time, let us learn, even when we
   are so oppressed with calamities as to be reduced to extremity, and on
   the brink of despair, to betake ourselves notwithstanding to God. Mercy
   is appropriately put in the first place; and then there is added
   salvation, which is the work and fruit of mercy; for no other reason
   can be assigned why God is induced to show himself our Savior, but that
   he is merciful. Whence it follows, that all who urge their own merits
   before Him as a plea for obtaining his favor, are shutting up the way
   of salvation.

   8. I will hear what God Jehovah will speak. The prophet, by his own
   example, here exhorts the whole body of the Church to quiet and calm
   endurance. As he had burst forth under the influence of strong emotion
   into a degree of vehemence, he now restrains himself as it were with a
   bridle; and in all our desires, be they never so devout and holy, we
   must always beware of their running to excess. When a man gives
   indulgence to his own infirmity, he is easily carried beyond the bounds
   of moderation by an undue ardor. For this reason the prophet enjoins
   silence, both upon himself and others, that they may patiently wait
   God's own time. By these words, he shows that he was in a composed
   state of mind, and, as it were, continued silent, because he was
   persuaded that the care of God is exercised about his Church. Had he
   thought that fortune held the sovereignty of the world, and that
   mankind are whirled round by a blind impulse, he would not, as he does,
   have represented God as sustaining the function of governing. To speak,
   in this passage, is equivalent to command, or to appoint. It is, as if
   he had said, Being confident that the remedy for our present calamities
   is in the hand of God, I will remain quiet until the fit time for
   delivering the Church arrive. As then the unruliness of our passions
   murmur, and raise an uproar against God, so patience is a kind of
   silence by which the godly keep themselves in subjection to his
   authority. In the second clause of the verse, the Psalmist comes to the
   conclusion, that the condition of the Church will be more prosperous:
   Surely he will speak peace to his people, and to his meek ones. As God
   rules supreme over the affairs of men, he cannot but provide for the
   welfare of his Church, which is the object of his special love. The
   word peace, we have elsewhere shown, is employed by the Hebrews to
   denote prosperity; and, accordingly, what is here expressed is, that
   the Church, by the Divine blessing, will prosper. Moreover, by the word
   speak, it is intimated that God will not fail to regard his promises.
   The Psalmist might have spoken more plainly of Divine Providence, as
   for instance in these terms, "I will look to what God will do;" but as
   the benefits bestowed upon the Church flow from the Divine promises, he
   makes mention of God's mouth rather than of his hand; and, at the same
   time, he shows that patience depends upon the quiet hearing of faith.
   When those to whom God speaks peace are not only described as his
   people, but also as his meek ones, this is a mark by which the genuine
   people of God are distinguished from such as bear merely the title of
   his people. As hypocrites arrogantly claim to themselves all the
   privileges of the Church, it is requisite to repel and exhibit the
   groundlessness of their boasting, in order to let them know that they
   are justly excluded from the promises of God.

   And they will not turn again to folly. The particle rendered and has
   usually been explained in this way: That they may not turn again to
   folly; as if this clause were added to express the fruit of the Divine
   goodness. As God, in dealing graciously with his people, allures them
   to himself, that they may continue obedient to him, the prophet, as
   these interpreters contend, maintains that they will not again return
   to folly, because the Divine goodness will serve as a bridle to
   restrain them. This exposition is admissible; but it will be more
   suitable to refer the sentence to the whole subject comprised in the
   passage -- to regard it, in short, as meaning, that after God has
   sufficiently chastised his Church, he will at length show himself
   merciful to her, that the saints, taught by chastisements, may exercise
   a stricter vigilance over themselves in future. The cause is shown why
   God suspends and delays the communications of his grace. As the
   physician, although his patient may experience some alleviation of his
   disease, keeps him still under medicinal treatment, until he become
   fully convalescent, and until, the cause of his disease being removed,
   his constitution become invigorated, -- for to allow him all at once to
   use whatever diet he chose, would be highly injurious to him; -- so
   God, perceiving that we are not completely recovered from our vices to
   spiritual health in one day, prolongs his chastisements: without which
   we would be in danger of a speedy relapse. Accordingly, the prophet, to
   assuage the grief with which the protracted duration of calamities
   would oppress the faithful, applies this remedy and solace, That God
   purposely continues his corrections for a longer period than they would
   wish, that they may be brought in good earnest to repent, and excited
   to be more on their guard in future.

   Psalm 85:9-13

   9. Surely [475] his salvation is near to them that fear him, that glory
   may dwell in our land. 10. Mercy and truth shall meet together;
   righteousness and peace shall kiss each other. 11. Truth shall spring
   [or bud] out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from
   heaven. 12. Likewise, Jehovah will grant prosperity: and our land shall
   yield her increase. 13. Righteousness shall go before him; and set her
   steps in the way.


   9 Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him. Here the Psalmist
   confirms the statement made in the preceding verse. He encourages both
   himself and other servants of God in the hope, that although to outward
   appearance God was far off from his people, yet deliverance was near at
   hand; because it is certain, that God secretly regards those whom he
   seems openly to neglect. If it is considered preferable to take the
   particle 'k, ach, adversatively, Yet his salvation, etc., -- a sense in
   which it is often used in Hebrew -- the sentence will be fuller. The
   prophet had just now said, that God continues to lengthen out the
   chastisement of his people, when he perceives that they are too prone
   to fall anew into sin; and here, lest his slowness in removing the
   stroke of his hand should prove too much for their patience, he
   qualifies the above statement, by observing, that even when the Divine
   help seems slowest in coming it is then near at hand. The glory which
   in the second part of the verse he anticipates will dwell in the land,
   is undoubtedly set in opposition to the ruinous appearance it then
   presented to the eye, which was a token of the dreadful anger of God,
   and which consigned the land to ignominy and reproach. [476] By this
   language, therefore, he encourages himself and other genuine believers
   to repentance, putting them in mind, that the grievous oppression,
   accompanied with insult and derision, to which they were subjected by
   the tyranny of their enemies, was to be ascribed entirely to their
   having driven away the salvation of God from them by their sins.

   10. Mercy and truth shall meet together. Here the verbs are in the past
   tense; but it is evident from the scope of the passage, that they
   should be translated into the future. I cordially embrace the opinion
   which is held by many, that we have here a prophecy concerning the
   kingdom of Christ. There is no doubt, that the faithful lifted up their
   eyes to Him, when their faith had need of encouragement and support in
   reference to the restoration of the Church; and especially after their
   return from Babylon. Meanwhile, the design of the prophet is, to show
   how bountifully God deals with his Church, after he is reconciled to
   her. The fruits which he represents as springing from this
   reconciliation are, first, that mercy and truth meet together; and,
   secondly, that righteousness and peace embrace each other From these
   words, Augustine deduces a beautiful sentiment, and one fraught with
   the sweetest consolation, That the mercy of God is the origin and
   source of all his promises, from whence issues the righteousness which
   is offered to us by the gospel, while from that righteousness proceeds
   the peace which we obtain by faith, when God justifies us freely.
   According to him, righteousness is represented as looking down from
   heaven, because it is the free gift of God, and not acquired by the
   merit of works; and that it comes from heaven, because it is not to be
   found among men, who are by nature utterly destitute of it. He also
   explains truth springing out of the earth as meaning, that God affords
   the most incontestable evidence of his faithfulness, in fulfilling what
   he has promised. But as we ought rather to seek after the solid truth,
   than exercise our ingenuity in searching out refined interpretations,
   let us rest contented with the natural meaning of the passage, which
   is, that mercy, truth, peace, and righteousness, will form the grand
   and ennobling distinction of the kingdom of Christ. The prophet does
   not proclaim the praises of men, but commends the grace which he had
   before hoped for, and supplicated from God only; thus teaching us to
   regard it as an undoubted truth, that all these blessings flow from
   God. By the figure synecdoche, some parts being put for the whole,
   there is described in these four words all the ingredients of true
   happiness. When cruelty rages with impunity, when truth is
   extinguished, when righteousness is oppressed and trampled under foot,
   and when all things are embroiled in confusion, were it not better that
   the world should be brought to an end, than that such a state of things
   should continue? Whence it follows, that nothing can contribute more
   effectually to the promotion of a happy life, than that these four
   virtues should flourish and rule supreme. The reign of Christ, in other
   parts of Scripture, is adorned with almost similar encomiums. If,
   however, any one would rather understand mercy and truth as referring
   to God, I have no disposition to enter into dispute with him. [477] The
   springing of truth out of the earth, and the looking down of
   righteousness from heaven, without doubt imply, that truth and
   righteousness will be universally diffused, as well above as beneath,
   so as to fill both heaven and earth. It is not meant to attribute
   something different to each of them, but to affirm in general, that
   there will be no corner of the earth where these qualities do not
   flourish.

   12. Likewise, Jehovah will grant prosperity. Some take this verse
   allegorically, and interpret it of the increase of spiritual blessings;
   but this does not agree with the particle gm, gam, rendered likewise,
   by which the prophet, in my opinion, intends to express the
   completeness of that blessedness of which he had spoken. He therefore
   mentions the fruit of the earth, as an additional proof of God's
   surpassing beneficence. The chief happiness of the Church is
   comprehended in these four blessings which he had specified; but the
   provision which is required for the support of our bodies ought not to
   be considered as unworthy of attention, provided our care about this
   matter is kept within proper bounds. If it is objected that these two
   subjects -- the spiritual kingdom of Christ, and the fruitfulness of
   the earth, are improperly intermingled, it may be easily observed in
   reply, that there is nothing at all incongruous in this, when we
   consider that God, while he bestows upon his people spiritual
   blessings, gives them, in addition to these, some taste of his fatherly
   love, in the outward benefits which relate to the life of the body; it
   being evident from the testimony of Paul, that

   "godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life
   that now is, and of that which is to come," (1 Timothy 4:8.)

   But let it be observed, that the faithful generally have only granted
   to them a limited portion of the comforts of this transitory life: that
   they may not be lulled asleep by the allurements of earth. I have
   therefore said, that, while on earth, they only taste of God's fatherly
   love, and are not filled with an overflowing abundance of the good
   things of this world. Moreover, we are taught from this verse, that the
   power and capacity of the earth to produce fruit for the sustenance of
   our bodies was not given to it once for all, -- as the heathen imagine
   God at the first creation to have adapted each element to its proper
   office, while he now sits in heaven in a state of indolence and repose;
   -- but that the earth is from year to year rendered fruitful by the
   secret influence of God, who designs hereby to afford us a
   manifestation of his goodness.

   13. Righteousness shall go before him. The word righteousness is taken
   by some for a righteous person; but this is unnatural. Viewed in this
   light, the passage, indeed, contains the useful and important truth,
   That the righteous man will walk before God, and will make it his
   object to regulate all his actions according to the principles of moral
   rectitude. But there being no necessity for wresting the word
   righteousness so violently, it will be better to adopt the more correct
   and simple view, which is, that under the reign of Christ order will be
   so well established, that righteousness will walk before God, and
   occupy every path. The prophet seems thus to call back the attention of
   the faithful to what constitutes the chief elements of blessedness; for
   although God may grant to his servants an abundant supply of sustenance
   for the body, it is unbecoming for them to have their hearts set upon
   this. And in truth, one difference between us and the lower animals is,
   that God, instead of pampering and stuffing our bellies, for the mere
   gratification of our animal appetites, directs our views to higher and
   more important objects. When it is said that righteousness shall go
   before God, the meaning is, that the prevalence and unobstructed course
   of righteousness, which is equivalent to setting her steps in the way,
   is to be attributed to the appointment of God. Isaiah, on the contrary,
   complains that equity, instead of setting her steps in the way, is
   prohibited from making her appearance in public, and meets with a
   universal repulse. "And judgment is turned away backward, and justice
   standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot
   enter," (Isaiah 59:14.) In this psalm prayers and holy meditations,
   engaged in with the view of nourishing and confirming faith, together
   with praises and thanksgivings, are intermingled. It having been
   difficult in the judgment of carnal reason for David to escape from the
   distresses with which he was environed, he sets in opposition to its
   conclusions the infinite goodness and power of God. Nor does he simply
   request deliverance from his enemies; but he also prays that the fear
   of God may be implanted and firmly established in his heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [475] Walford, who thinks that the composition of this psalm is
   referable to some period subsequent to the return of God's ancient
   people from Babylon, explains this concluding clause of the 9th verse
   as follows: -- "The glory that is here spoken of is that which was
   formerly enjoyed, when they were surrounded on all sides by prosperity;
   and when especially they were favored with the tokens of the divine
   presence, in the performance of all the instituted worship of the
   sanctuary, when the ark, the temples etc., were in their pristine
   beauty and splendor."

   [476] Mercy and truth are very generally applied by commentators to
   God; and the passage is understood as the celebration of the harmony of
   the divine attributes in the salvation of man. The description is one
   of great beauty and sublimity. "How admirable," says Bishop Lowth, in
   illustrating this verse, "is that celebrated personification of the
   divine attributes by the Psalmist; How just, elegant, and splendid does
   it appear, if applied only according to the literal sense, to the
   restoration of the Jewish nation from the Babylonish captivity! but if
   interpreted as relating to that sublimer, more sacred, and mystical
   sense, which is not obscurely shadowed under the ostensible image, it
   is certainly uncommonly noble and elevated, mysterious and sublime." --
   (Lowth's Lectures on Hebrew Poetry, volume 1, page 284.) Dr Adam Clarke
   gives a turn to the text, which still more heightens its effect. "It
   would be more simple," says he, "to translate the original, Mercy and
   truth have met on the way;
   Righteousness and peace have embraced.' This is a remarkable text, and
   much has been said on it: but there is a beauty in it, which I think
   has not been noticed. "Mercy and peace are on one side: truth and
   righteousness on the other. Truth requires righteousness; mercy calls
   for peace. "They meet together on the way; one going to make
   inquisition for sin, the other to plead for reconciliation. Having met,
   their differences on certain considerations (not here particularly
   mentioned) are adjusted: their mutual claims are blended together in
   one common interest; on which peace and righteousness immediately
   embrace. Thus righteousness is given to truth; and peace is given to
   mercy. "Now, Where did these meet? -- In Christ Jesus. "When were they
   reconciled? -- When He poured out His life on Calvary."

   [477] "Pource qu'on luy defend de se trouver en public et que chacun la
   repousse." -- Fr.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [472] "ns't vn, nasata avon, Thou hast borne, or carried away, the
   iniquity. An allusion to the ceremony of the scape-goat." -- Dr Adam
   Clarke "It is a maxim among the Jewish doctors," says Hammond, "that
   captivity is one way of expiation, and so to return from thence was a
   sure indication that the sin for which it was inflicted was remitted or
   done away. This, saith Abarbanel, on Leviticus 16, was adumbrated in
   the Azazel, or scape-goat, which, as the other that was slain, was a
   sin-offering, as appears, Leviticus 16:5. He shall take two kids for a
   sin-offering.' And then the confessing the sins over him,' mentioned
   16:21, (Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat,
   and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
   etc., putting them on the head of the goat: And the goat shall bear
   upon him all their iniquities into a land of separation,' 16:22,) shows
   that they were to carry their sins with them into the land of their
   captivity, meant by the land of separation, that land whatsoever it
   was, whither the Divine Providence had designed their deportation. From
   whence therefore being now returned, their sins, for which they were
   thus punished, are supposed to be left behind them, no more to be laid
   to their charge, if their return to their former sins do not cause them
   to be called to remembrance."

   PSALM 86

   In this psalm prayers and holy meditations, engaged in with the view of
   nourishing and confirming faith, together with praises and
   thanksgivings, are intermingled. It having been difficult in the
   judgement of carnal reason for David to escape from the distresses with
   which he was environed, he sets in opposition to its conclusions the
   infinite goodness and power of God. Nor does he simply request
   deliverance from his enemies; but he also prays that the fear of God
   may be implanted and firmly established in heart.

   A Prayer of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 86:1-7

   1. Incline thy ear, O Jehovah! answer me; for I am poor and needy. 2.
   Preserve my soul, for I am meek: [478] O my God! save thy servant who
   trusteth in thee. 3. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah! for daily [479] do
   I cry to thee. 4. Make glad the soul of thy servant; for to thee, O
   Lord! [480] do I lift up my soul. 5. For thou, O Lord! art good, and
   gracious, and of great mercy to all who call upon thee. 6. Listen, O
   Jehovah! to my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications. 7.
   In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer
   me.


   1. Incline thy ear, O Jehovah! Neither the inscription nor the contents
   of this psalm enable us to conclude with certainty what dangers David
   here complains of; but the psalm in all probability refers to that
   period of his life when he was persecuted by Saul, and describes the
   train of thought which then occupied his mind, although it may not have
   been written until after his restoration to a state of outward peace
   and tranquillity, when he enjoyed greater leisure. He does not without
   cause allege before God the oppressions which he endured as a plea for
   obtaining the divine favor; for nothing is more suitable to the nature
   of God than to succor the afflicted: and the more severely any one is
   oppressed, and the more destitute he is of the resources of human aid,
   the more inclined is God graciously to help him. That despair therefore
   may not overwhelm our minds under our greatest afflictions, let us
   support ourselves from the consideration that the Holy Spirit has
   dictated this prayer for the poor and the afflicted.

   2. Preserve my soul, for I am meek. Here the Psalmist adduces two other
   arguments by which to stir up God to grant him succor, -- his own
   gentleness towards his neighbors, and the trust which he reposed in
   God. In the first clause he may seem at first sight to make some
   pretensions to personal worth; yet he plainly shows that nothing was
   farther from his intention than to insinuate that by any merits of his
   own he had brought God under obligations to preserve him. But the
   particular mention made of his clemency or meekness tends to exhibit in
   a more odious light the wickedness of his enemies, who had treated so
   shamefully, and with such inhumanity, a man against whom they could
   bring no well-founded charge, and who had even endeavored to the utmost
   of his power to please them. [481] Since God then has avowed himself to
   be the defender both of good causes and of those who follow after
   righteousness, David, not without good reason, testifies that he had
   endeavored to exercise kindness and gentleness; that from this it may
   appear that he was basely requited by his enemies, when they
   gratuitously acted with cruelty towards a merciful man. But as it would
   not be enough for our lives to be characterised by kindness and
   righteousness, an additional qualification is subjoined -- that of
   trust or confidence in God, which is the mother of all true religion.
   Some, we are aware, have been endued with so high a degree of
   integrity, as to have obtained among men the praise of being perfectly
   just, even as Aristides gloried in having never given any man cause of
   sorrow. But as those men, with all the excellence of their virtues,
   were either filled with ambition, or inflated with pride, which made
   them trust more to themselves than to God, it is not surprising to find
   them suffering the punishment of their vanity. In reading profane
   history, we are disposed to marvel how it came to pass that God
   abandoned the honest, the grave, and the temperate, to the enraged
   passions of a wicked multitude; but there is no reason for wondering at
   this when we reflect that such persons, relying on their own strength
   and virtue, despised the grace of God with all the superciliousness of
   impiety. Making an idol of their own virtue they disdained to lift up
   their eyes to Him. Although, therefore, we may have the testimony of an
   approving conscience, and although He may be the best witness of our
   innocence, yet if we are desirous of obtaining his assistance, it is
   necessary for us to commit our hopes and anxieties to him. If it is
   objected, that in this way the gate is shut against sinners, I answer,
   that when God invites to himself those who are blameless and upright in
   their deportment, this does not imply that he forthwith repels all who
   are punished on account of their sins; for they have an opportunity
   given them, if they will improve it, for prayer and the acknowledgement
   of their guilt. [482] , But if those whom we have never offended
   unrighteously assail us, we have ground for double confidence before
   God.

   3 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah! The Psalmist again betakes himself to
   the mercy of God. The word chnn, chanan, which I have rendered have
   mercy, is substantially the same as to gratify, to do a pleasure. It is
   as if he had said, I bring no merit of my own, but humbly pray for
   deliverance solely on the ground of thy mercy. When he speaks of crying
   daily, it is a proof of his hope and confidence, of which we have
   spoken a little before. By the word cry, as I have already had occasion
   frequently to remark, is denoted vehemence and earnestness of soul. The
   saints do not indeed always pray with a loud voice; but their secret
   sighs and groanings resound and echo upwards, and, ascending from their
   hearts, penetrate even into heaven. The inspired suppliant not only
   represents himself as crying, but as persevering in doing so, to teach
   us that he was not discouraged at the first or second encounter, but
   continued in prayer with untiring earnestness. In the following verse,
   he expresses more definitely the end for which he besought God to be
   merciful to him, which was, that his sorrow might be removed. In the
   second clause, he declares that there was no hypocrisy in his crying;
   for he lifted up his soul to God, which is the chief characteristic of
   right prayer.

   5 For thou, O Lord! art good and propitious. [483] We have here a
   confirmation of the whole preceding doctrine, derived from the nature
   of God. It would avail the afflicted nothing to have recourse to him,
   and to lift up their desires and prayers to heaven, were they not
   persuaded that he is a faithful rewarder of all who call upon him. The
   point upon which David now insists is, that God is bountiful and
   inclined to compassion, and that his mercy is so great, as to render it
   impossible for him to reject any who implore his aid. He calls God
   propitious, or ascribes to him the attribute of pardoning sin, which is
   a modification of his goodness. It were not enough for God to be good
   in general, did he not also extend to sinners his forgiving mercy,
   which is the meaning of the word slh, salach. Farther, although David
   magnifies the plenteousness of God's mercy, yet he immediately after
   represents this plenteousness as restricted to the faithful who call
   upon him, to teach us that those who, making no account of God,
   obstinately chafe upon the bit, deservedly perish in their calamities.
   At the same time, he uses the term all, that every man, without
   exception, from the greatest to the least, may be encouraged
   confidently to betake himself to the goodness and mercy of God.

   6 Listen, O Jehovah! to my prayer. From the earnest repetition of his
   former requests in this and the subsequent verse, it is evident that he
   was oppressed with no ordinary degree of grief, and also agitated with
   extreme anxiety, From this example, we are taught that those who,
   having engaged in prayer once, allow themselves immediately to give
   over that exercise, provided God does not at once grant them their
   desire, betray the coldness and inconstancy of their hearts. Nor is
   this repetition of the same requests to be thought superfluous; for
   hereby the saints, by little and little, discharge their cares into the
   bosom of God, and this importunity is a sacrifice of a sweet savor
   before Him. When the Psalmist says, God will hear me when I cry in the
   day of trouble, he makes a particular application to himself of the
   truth which he had just now stated, That God is merciful and gracious
   to all who call upon him.

   Psalm 86:8-11

   8. Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord! nor any that
   can work as thou workest. 9. All the nations which thou hast made shall
   come and worship before thy face, O Lord! and shall give glory to thy
   name. 10. For thou art great, and thou alone, O God! doest wondrous
   things. 11. Show me thy ways, O Jehovah! I will walk in thy truth:
   unite my heart to fear thy name.


   8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord! Here the
   Psalmist may be considered either as bursting forth into thanksgivings,
   after having obtained what he desired, or else as gathering courage and
   new strength for prayer. The latter opinion I am most inclined to
   adopt; but perhaps it may be preferable to regard both views as
   included. Some understand the word 'lhvm, Elohim, as denoting angels --
   There is none like unto thee, O Lord! among the angels -- as if David
   compared them with the Most High God; but this does not seem to agree
   so well with the passage. He does not humble the angels, representing
   them as inferior gods, that they may give place to the power of God;
   but he holds up to contempt and derision all the false gods in whom the
   heathen world imagined some help was to be found; [484] and he does
   this because they could supply no evidence of their being gods from
   their works. Had he distributed the power of working between them and
   the true God in different degrees, assigning less to the former and
   more to the latter, he would not have attributed to God that which is
   naturally and exclusively his own. He therefore affirms, without
   qualification, that no characteristic of Deity could be perceived in
   them, or traced in any works performed by them. In calling us to the
   consideration of works, he clearly shows, that those who indulge in
   ingenious speculations about the occult or secret essence of God, and
   pass over the unequivocal traces of his majesty which are to be seen
   beaming forth in bright effulgence in his works, do but trifle and
   spend their time to no purpose. As the Divine nature is infinitely
   exalted above the comprehension of our understanding, David wisely
   confines his attention to the testimony of God's works, and declares
   that the gods who put forth no power are false and counterfeit. If it
   is objected that there is no comparison between God and the silly
   inventions of men, the answer is obvious, That this language is
   employed in accommodation to the ignorance of the generality of men.
   The effrontery with which the superstitious exalt the spurious
   fabrications of their own brain above the heavens is well known; and
   David very justly derides their madness in forging gods to themselves,
   which in reality are no gods.

   9 All nations which thou hast made shall come. [485] If any would
   rather limit what is here stated to David's present case, this view
   does not seem liable to any material objection. He, in fact, often
   enhances the Divine goodness of which he himself had experience by the
   like magnificent strain. It may, however, be fitly extended to the
   universal power of God; but whether he speaks of the grace that was
   bestowed upon himself alone, or treats, in general, of the works of
   God, we must bear in mind what has been observed in another place, that
   whenever he celebrates the prevalence of true godliness among the
   heathen, he has an eye to the kingdom of Christ, prior to whose coming
   God gave only the initial or dawning manifestation of his glory, which
   at length was diffused through the whole world by the preaching of the
   Gospel. David was not ignorant of the future calling of the Gentiles;
   but this being a doctrine with which Jewish ears were not familiar,
   that people would have felt it a disagreeable announcement, to have
   been told that the Gentiles should come to worship God indiscriminately
   with the children of Abraham, and, all distinction being removed,
   become partakers with them of heavenly truth. To soften the
   announcement, he asserts that the Gentiles also were created by God, so
   that it ought not to be accounted strange if they, being enlightened
   also, should at length acknowledge Him who had created and fashioned
   them.

   10. For thou art great, and thou alone, O God! doest wondrous things.
   In this verse there is again repeated the cause which will bring all
   nations to worship before the Lord, namely, the discovery made of his
   glory by the greatness of his works. The contemplation of God's glory
   in his works is the true way of acquiring genuine godliness. The pride
   of the flesh would always lead it to wing its way into heaven; but, as
   our understandings fail us in such an extended investigation, our most
   profitable course is, according to the small measure of our feeble
   capacity, to seek God in his works, which bear witness of him. Let us
   therefore learn to awaken our understandings to contemplate the divine
   works, and let us leave the presumptuous to wander in their own
   intricate mazes, which, in the end, will invariably land them in an
   abyss from which they will be unable to extricate themselves. To
   incline our hearts to exercise this modesty, David magnificently extols
   the works of God, calling them wondrous things, although to the blind,
   and those who have no taste for them, they are destitute of attraction.
   In the meantime, we ought carefully to attend to this truth, That the
   glory of Godhead belongs exclusively to the one true God; for in no
   other being is it possible to find the wisdom, or the power, or the
   righteousness, or any of the numerous marks of divinity which shine
   forth in his wonderful works. Whence it follows, that the Papists are
   chargeable with rendering, as much as in them lies, his title to true
   Godhead nugatory, when despoiling him of his attributes they leave him
   almost nothing but the bare name.

   11. Show me thy ways, O Jehovah! David now rises higher, praying that
   he may be governed by the spirit of sound understanding, in order to
   his living a holy life, and that he may be strengthened in his
   endeavors thereto by the spirit of fortitude. He tacitly contrasts the
   ways of God with all the counsels which he could derive from carnal
   reason. In submitting himself to God, and in imploring Him to be his
   guide, he confesses that the only possible way by which we can be
   enabled to live a holy and an upright life is, when God goes before us,
   while we follow after him; and, accordingly, that those who deviate,
   let it be never so little, from the law through a proud conceit of
   their own wisdom, wander from the right path. This he more fully
   confirms, by adding immediately after, I will walk in thy truth. He
   pronounces all to be guilty of vanity and lying who observe not this
   rule of truth. Farther, his prayer to be taught in the ways of the Lord
   does not imply that he had been previously altogether ignorant of
   divine truth; but well aware of the much darkness -- of the many clouds
   of ignorance in which he was still enveloped, he aspires after greater
   improvement. Let it also be observed, that he is not to be understood
   as speaking only of external teaching: but having the law among his
   hands, he prays for the inward light of the Holy Spirit, that he may
   not labor in the unprofitable task of learning only the letter;
   according as he prays in another place,

   "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
   law," (Psalm 119:18.)

   If a prophet so distinguished, and so richly endued with the graces of
   the Holy Spirit, makes such a frank and cordial confession of his own
   ignorance, how great our folly if we feel not our own deficiency, and
   are not stirred up to greater diligence in self-improvement from the
   knowledge of our slender attainments! And, assuredly, the more progress
   a man has made in the knowledge of the true religion, the more sensible
   will he be that he is far from the mark. Secondly, it is necessary to
   add, that reading or hearing is not enough, unless God impart to us
   inward light by his Spirit.

   In addition to this, the Psalmist desires that his heart may be framed
   for yielding obedience to God, and that it may be firmly established
   therein; for as our understanding has need of light, so has our will of
   uprightness. The original words which I have translated, unite my
   heart, are translated by some, rejoice my heart, as if the verb were
   from the root, chdh, chadah, to rejoice; [486] but it rather comes from
   ychd, yachad, to unite -- a sense which is very suitable to the passage
   before us. [487] This word contains a tacit contrast, which has not
   been sufficiently attended to, between the unwavering purpose with
   which the heart of man cleaves to God when it is under the guidance of
   the Holy Spirit, and the disquietude with which it is distracted and
   tossed so long as it fluctuates amidst its own affections. It is
   therefore indispensably requisite, that the faithful, after having
   learned what is right, should firmly and cordially embrace it, that the
   heart may not break forth in impetuous desire after unhallowed lusts.
   Thus, in the word unite, there is a very beautiful metaphor, conveying
   the idea, that the heart of man is full of tumult, drawn asunder, and,
   as it were, scattered about in fragments, until God has gathered it to
   himself, and holds it together in a state of steadfast and persevering
   obedience. From this also, it is manifest what free will is able to do
   of itself. Two powers are ascribed to it; but David confesses that he
   is destitute of both; setting the light of the Holy Spirit in
   opposition to the blindness of his own mind; and affirming that
   uprightness of heart is entirely the gift of God.

   Psalm 86:12-17

   12. I will praise thee, O Lord my God! With all my heart: and I will
   glorify thy name for ever. 13. For thy mercy has been great towards me:
   and thou hast delivered my soul from the lower grave. [488] 14. O God!
   the proud have risen up against me, and a company of mighty men have
   sought after my soul; and they have not set thee before them. 15. And
   thou, O Lord! art God, merciful, ready to forgive, long-suffering, and
   abundant in mercy and truth. 16. Look to me, and have pity upon me:
   give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid. 17.
   Make with me a sign for good: and my adversaries will see it [489] and
   be ashamed; for thou, O Jehovah! hast succoured and comforted me.


   12. I will praise thee, O Lord my God! David engages, when he shall
   have experienced God to be in all respects a beneficent father, to
   yield to him the tribute of gratitude. He expressed in the preceding
   verse a desire to have his heart united to God, that he might fear him;
   and now he affirms it to be his resolution to publish or celebrate his
   praises, not only with the mouth or tongue, but also with sincere
   affection of heart; yea, even to continue with steadfast perseverance
   in that exercise.

   In the 13th verse, he sets forth the reason of this, which is, because,
   in delivering him, God had given a singular and remarkable proof of his
   mercy. To place in a stronger light the greatness of this benefit, he
   describes the dangers from which he had been delivered, by the
   expression, the lower grave; as if he had said, I have not been held
   down by one death only, but have been thrust down into the lowest
   depths of the grave, so that my circumstances required the hand of God
   to be stretched out to me in a wonderful manner. By the grace of the
   Lord Jesus Christ we are delivered from a still deeper abyss of death;
   and such being the case, our ingratitude will be inexcusable, unless
   each of us exercise himself to the utmost of his power in celebrating
   this deliverance. If David so highly magnified the name of God merely
   on account of the prolongation of his life for a short time, what
   praises are due for this unparalleled redemption by which we are drawn
   from the depths of hell and elevated to heaven? The Papists attempt to
   found an argument on this passage in support of their doctrine of
   Purgatory, as if that were an upper hell, while there was another
   lower; [490] but this argument is too rotten to stand in need of
   refutation.

   14. O God! the proud are risen up against me. Instead of zdym, zedim,
   the proud, some read, zrym, zarim, strangers; and, undoubtedly, the
   Scriptures often employ this word to denote barbarous cruelty, so that
   it is the same as if it had been said, the cruel. I, however, prefer
   following the generally received reading. As between the Hebrew word
   zdym, zedim, the proud, and zrym, zarim, strangers, there is only the
   difference of a single letter, the one having the letter d, daleth,
   where the other has the letter r, resh, it is obvious that, from the
   similarity of these two letters, the former might easily have been
   changed into the latter. Besides, the word, proud, agrees better with
   the scope of the passage; for, in the same sense, the Psalmist
   immediately after applies the epithet, strong, to those who, with
   headlong impetuosity and fierceness, rushed upon him to destroy him;
   and we know that where pride reigns no moderation is observed. He
   expresses without figure what he had just now said respecting the
   grave. Being as a lamb in the midst of wolves, he would have been
   quickly swallowed up, had not God miraculously delivered him, as it
   were, from the jaws of death. In representing his enemies as having no
   regard to God, he means to set forth the extreme excess of their
   cruelty. The fury of our lusts, unless we are restrained by the fear of
   God and the sense of his judgment, will become so great as to dare any
   thing, however atrocious. For these calamities he seeks a remedy, in
   the Divine mercy, in the following verse.

   15. And thou, O Lord! art God, merciful, ready to forgive. By
   immediately passing on to the celebration of these divine attributes,
   he would intimate, that we have adequate strength and protection
   against the audacity and rage of the wicked, in the divine goodness,
   mercy, and faithfulness. Perhaps, also, from his feeling that the
   wicked were scourges in the hand of God, he set before himself the
   divine goodness and mercy, to allay the excess of terror with which he
   might be seized; for this is the true and the only source of comfort,
   that although God chastise us he does not forget his mercy. This
   sentence, as is well known, is taken from Exodus 34:6, where we meet
   with a very remarkable description of the nature of God. First, he is
   called merciful; in the next place, ready to forgive, which he
   manifests by compassionating our distresses. In the third place, he is
   described as long-suffering; for he is not angry whenever an offense is
   committed against him, but pardons us according to the greatness of his
   loving-kindness. In short, he is said to be abundant in mercy and
   truth; by which I understand, that his beneficence is continually
   exercised, and that he is always true. He is indeed no less worthy to
   be praised on account of his rigour, than on account of his mercy; but
   as it is our wilful obstinacy alone which makes him severe, compelling
   him, as it were, to punish us, the Scriptures, in representing him as
   by nature merciful and ready to forgive, teach us, that if he is at any
   time rigorous and severe, this is, as it were, accidental to him. I am
   speaking, it is true, in popular language, and such as is not strictly
   correct; but still, these terms by which the divine character is
   described amount in effect to this, That God is by nature so gracious
   and ready to forgive, that he seems to connive at our sins, delays the
   infliction of punishment, and never proceeds to execute vengeance
   unless compelled by our obstinate wickedness. Why the truth of God is
   joined with his mercy has been considered in another place. As even
   those who are most generous sometimes desire to retract the promises
   which they have made, repenting of their too great facility, we who are
   accustomed unreasonably to judge of God by ourselves, distrust his
   promises. God therefore declares, that he is unlike men, because he is
   as firm to his purpose in abundantly performing whatever he has
   promised, as he is distinguished for promising liberally.

   16. Look to me, and have pity upon me. Here the Psalmist makes a more
   distinct application to himself of what he had said concerning the
   divine mercy and goodness. As God is merciful, he assures himself that
   his welfare will be the object of the divine care. The second verb in
   the verse, chnn, chanan, which I have rendered have pity, signifies to
   gratify, to do one a pleasure; and is intended to convey the idea, that
   the succor which God affords to his people proceeds from his free
   goodness. [491] Finally, the Psalmist concludes, that the only way in
   which he can be preserved is by the divine aid, which he seeks to
   obtain by prayer; and thus he confesses his utter destitution of any
   strength of his own. In applying to himself the appellation of God's
   servant, and the son of his handmaid, he does not boast of his own
   services, but urges as a plea, for obtaining greater favor at the
   divine hand, the long line of his ancestors, and the continual course
   of God's grace; setting forth, that he was from his mother's womb a
   household-servant of God, and, as it were, born one of his servants in
   his house: [492] a point of which we have already spoken elsewhere.

   The last verse contains an additional confirmation of the statement,
   that he was in a manner forsaken of God. He would not have desired to
   be favored with some token of the divine favor, had he not been on all
   sides driven to despair, and had not the divine favor been hidden from
   him to try his patience. It was a proof of no ordinary steadfastness to
   maintain the conflict with this temptation, and to do this so
   successfully, as not to cease to descry light in the midst of darkness.
   He desires that his enemies may be put to shame, because they assailed
   his simplicity with mockery and scoffing, as if he had acted a foolish
   part by trusting in God. The miserable and distressing condition in
   which the Church was placed after the Babylonish captivity, might be
   apt to sink the minds of the godly into despondency; and, accordingly,
   the Holy Spirit here promises her restoration in a wonderful and
   incredible manner, so that nothing would be more desirable than to be
   reckoned among the number of her members.

   PSALM 87

   A Psalm or Song of the sons of Korah.

   It is evident, from constant observation, that, so long as the children
   of this world are in prosperity, they are well satisfied with their
   condition, and mightily extol it, while they look upon the Church with
   proud contempt; and even after having endured calamities, they are not
   so subdued by them as to renounce the foolish presumption by which they
   are intoxicated. Meanwhile they recklessly despise all religion, and
   the worship of God, because, contenting themselves with pleasures,
   riches, and the splendor of honor, they fancy themselves to be happy
   without him. And then it often happens, that the Lord pampers them with
   all kind of good things, purposing at length to inflict upon them
   merited punishment for their ingratitude, when the fit season shall
   have arrived; while, on the contrary, he loads his Church with various
   and grievous afflictions, or, at least, keeps her in a low and despised
   condition, so that she may seem to herself to be miserable, or she is
   at least exposed to the contempt of others. That the faithful may not
   be deceived with this shadowy appearance of things, it is of importance
   to recall their attention to a different subject, that they may be
   persuaded of the truth of what is stated in Psalm 33:12,

   "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he
   hath chosen for his own inheritance."
   (Psalm 33:12)

   What we are taught in this psalm may be summed up in this, That the
   Church of God far excels all the kingdoms and politics of the world,
   inasmuch as she is watched over, and protected by Him in all her
   interests, and placed under his government; that, in the first place,
   amidst the violent commotions and dreadful storms with which the whole
   world is often shaken, she may continue safe; and, in the second place,
   and principally, that being wonderfully preserved by the protection of
   the same God, she may at length, after the toil and struggle of a
   protracted warfare, be crowned with the triumphant laurels of her high
   calling. It is in truth a singular benefit of God, and at the same
   time, a signal miracle, that, amidst the great and various revolutions
   of the kingdoms of this world, he enlarges her continually from age to
   age, and preserves her from destruction; so that in the whole world
   there is nothing enduring but the Church. As, however, it often
   happens, that whilst the wicked abound in riches, and have lavished
   upon them worldly possessions and authority, the afflicted Church is
   tossed amidst many dangers, or rather, is so overwhelmed with impetuous
   floods as to seem to be entirely shipwrecked, her happiness must be
   considered as consisting principally in this, that she has reserved for
   her an everlasting state in heaven.

   An attention to the time when this psalm was composed will contribute,
   in no small degree, to a clear understanding of its contents. Although
   the people had returned from their captivity in Babylon; although the
   Church of God had been again gathered together, and united into one
   body after a long dispersion; although the temple had been rebuilt, the
   altar set up, and the service of God restored; yet, as of a vast
   multitude of people, there was only a small portion remaining, which
   made the condition of the Church very low and despised, -- as the
   number left was daily diminished by their enemies, -- and as the temple
   was far inferior in magnificence to what it originally was; -- all this
   being considered, the faithful had hardly any ground to entertain
   favorable hopes as to the future. It certainly seemed impossible that
   they would ever again be raised to their former state from which they
   had fallen. There was, therefore, reason to apprehend that the minds of
   the godly, both from the remembrance of the overthrow which they had
   already experienced, and from the weight of the present miseries with
   which they were oppressed, would faint and finally sink into despair.
   That they might not succumb under such heavy adversities, the Lord not
   only promises in this psalm that they would recover what they had lost,
   but also encourages them in the hope of an incomparable glory with
   which the Church should yet be invested, according to that prophecy of
   Haggai,

   "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former."
   (Haggai 2:9)

   Last of all, it remains that we learn to accommodate this psalm to our
   own circumstances, and study to derive from it the lessons which it is
   fitted to convey. The consolation contained in it ought to have had
   such influence on the godly of that age, as to have made them not only
   stand erect in the midst of their adversities, but also to have raised
   them from the grave, and lifted them up to heaven. In the present day,
   when we know that whatever was foretold by the Spirit has been
   fulfilled, we are more than ungrateful if the experience of the
   fathers, added to the words of the Spirit, does not more powerfully
   confirm our faith. It is impossible to express in language adequate to
   the subject the glory with which Christ beautified his Church by his
   advent. Then the true religion which before had been shut up within the
   narrow limits of Judea was spread abroad through the whole world. Then
   God, who had been known only by one family, began to be called upon in
   the different languages of all nations. Then the world, which had been
   miserably rent in pieces by innumerable sects of superstition and
   error, was gathered together into a holy unity of faith. Then all men,
   vying with each other, associated themselves in companies to the
   society of the Jews, whom they had before abhorred. Then the kings of
   the earth and their people voluntarily yielded themselves to the yoke
   of Christ; wolves and lions were converted into lambs; the gifts of the
   Holy Spirit were poured out upon the faithful, -- gifts which far
   surpassed all the glory, all the riches, and grandeur, and precious
   ornaments of the world. [493] The body of the Church also was gathered
   together out of countries far distant from each other, and was
   increased and preserved in a wonderful manner. The gospel was spread
   far and wide within a period of time incredibly short, and equally
   extraordinary was the rich harvest of fruit with which the preaching of
   it was succeeded. Although, therefore, the renown of the Church had
   never been celebrated by this prophecy, yet the goodly and unequalled
   condition of that age, which may be called the Golden Age, clearly
   demonstrate that she was truly the heavenly kingdom of God. It was
   however requisite, even at that period, that the faithful should form
   their estimate of her excellence by something higher than carnal sense
   or reason. At the time when she flourished most, it was not purple,
   gold, and precious stones, which imparted to her the splendor which
   invested her, but the blood of martyrs. Rich she was in the graces of
   the Spirit, and yet poor and destitute of earthly possessions.
   Beautiful and glorious in holiness before God and the angels, she was
   nevertheless contemptible in the eyes of the world. Without she had
   many avowed enemies, who either exercised towards her fierce and cruel
   persecution, or by indirect acts practiced against her, the worst that
   craft could suggest; while within were alarms and treachery. In short,
   her dignity, venerable indeed, but yet spiritual, lay as yet hidden
   beneath the cross of Christ. The consolation, therefore, contained in
   this psalm was very seasonable, even at that time, for encouraging the
   faithful to wait for a more perfect state of the Church But the case
   stands otherwise with us. It has already long ago come to pass, [494]
   through the default of our fathers, that that renowned beauty of the
   Church has lain polluted and disfigured under the feet of the wicked.
   And at the present day, overwhelmed with the load of our sins, she
   groans under miserable desolation, under the scornful reproaches of the
   devil and the world, under the cruelty of tyrants, and under the wicked
   calumnies of enemies; so that the children of this world, who wish to
   live at ease, desire nothing less than to be accounted among the people
   of God. Whence we may perceive the more clearly how much benefit may be
   derived from this psalm; and, at the same time, how necessary it is to
   meditate upon it continually. The title does not so much refer to the
   authors of the psalm as to the chief musicians to whom it was committed
   to be sung. It is, however, possible that some Levite of the family of
   Korah composed it.

   Psalm 87:1-3

   1. His foundations are in the holy mountains. 2. Jehovah loveth the
   gates of Zion above all the dwellings of Jacob. 3. Glorious things are
   spoken of thee, O city of God! Selah.


   1 His foundations are in the holy mountains. Those who conceive that
   Jerusalem is here meant, as if it were said to be founded upon the holy
   mountains, are in my judgment mistaken; for the relative is in the
   masculine gender. Some learned men, I am aware, defend this opinion, by
   supposing that the words, the people, are to be supplied, although it
   is the capital of Judea which is specified. But it is unnecessary for
   me to say any thing to prove what is apparent to all, that this
   exposition is forced. Some Jewish interpreters have thought it most
   probable that this opening sentence is to be referred to the psalm
   itself; and, accordingly, they explain foundations as denoting
   metaphorically the theme, or subject of the poem, because it treats of
   the holy city Jerusalem, which was situated upon mountains. But I am
   surprised that they should have been mistaken in a matter so very
   obvious. It being quite a common thing among the Hebrews to put a
   relative without its antecedent, [495] this manner of speaking ought
   not to seem harsh or strange. The name of God is mentioned a little
   after; and we know that he is everywhere represented as having founded
   Jerusalem.

   Some by the mountains understand Moriah and Zion, [496] which were the
   two tops of a mountain cleft into two, but this is too forced. As the
   country was mountainous, we are rather to understand the prophet as
   having in his eye the several neighboring and contiguous mountains
   which formed a chain around Jerusalem; for we will see in another place
   that Jerusalem was surrounded by mountains, (Psalm 125:2.) The true and
   natural meaning then is, that God chose the holy mountains in order to
   found and erect his city in the midst of them. For a little after, in
   the prosecution of the subject, these words occur, "The Highest himself
   shall establish her." He is indeed the founder of other cities also;
   yet we do not read of him saying with respect to any other city,

   "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it,"
   (Psalm 132:14.)

   There is this difference, which is always to be remembered, that while
   other cities were founded and built by the guidance and power of God,
   merely for the sake of civil government, Jerusalem was his peculiar
   sanctuary, and his royal seat. Isaiah also uses a similar form of
   expression, (Isaiah 14:32,) "The Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor
   of his people shall trust in it." Besides, although the whole country
   of Judea was consecrated to God, yet he is said to have rejected all
   the other cities, and to have chosen this one for himself in which to
   reign. Here the question is not about earthly polity, but spiritual
   government; for the pure religion, and the true worship of God, and the
   doctrine of godliness, were at that time to be found nowhere but in
   Jerusalem.

   2 Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion above all the dwellings of Jacob.
   Here we are taught that all the excellence of the holy city depended on
   the free choice which God had made of it. With this agrees what is
   stated in Psalm 78:60, 67, that God rejected Shiloh, the tribe of
   Ephraim, and the tabernacle of Joseph, that he might dwell in Zion
   which he loved. The prophet then points out the cause why God preferred
   that one place before all others; and the cause which he assigns is,
   not the worth of the place itself, but the free love of God. If it is
   demanded why Jerusalem was so highly distinguished, let this short
   answer be deemed sufficient, Because it so pleased God. To this the
   divine love is to be traced as its source; but the end of such a choice
   was, that there might be some fixed place in which the true religion
   should be preserved, and the unity of the faith maintained, until the
   advent of Christ, and from which it might afterwards flow into all the
   regions of the earth. This, then, explains why the prophet celebrates
   Jerusalem as possessing the high distinction of having God for its
   master-builder, its founder and protector. Farther, he attributes to
   the divine favor and adoption whatever excellence it possessed above
   other places. In putting Zion for Jerusalem, and the gates for the
   whole compass of the city, there is a double synecdoche.

   3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God! The reading
   literally is, That which is spoken in thee are glorious things. We must
   consider the design of the prophet, or rather the object of the Spirit
   of God, speaking by the mouth of the prophet. From the low and despised
   condition of the whole people, from the many and terrible enemies who
   pressed hard upon them on all sides, from the small number who had
   sufficient courage to surmount the obstacles in their way, from the new
   and unlooked-for changes which were daily springing up, from the danger
   there was lest the state of affairs gradually sinking more and more
   into decay, should at length become desperate, it was difficult to
   cherish the hope that the holy city would be restored. That despair
   might not overcome the hearts of the faithful, and cause them to fail,
   there is set before them the supporting and consolatory consideration,
   that the Lord hath spoken differently concerning the future condition
   of the Church. Their attention, there can be no doubt, is called away
   from the present aspect of things, and directed to the promises which
   inspired them with the hope of the wonderful glory with which she
   should be adorned. Although, therefore, nothing appeared to the eye of
   sense and reason, calculated greatly to rejoice the heart, yet the
   prophet would have them encouraged by the word to stand as it were on a
   watch-tower, waiting patiently for the fulfillment of what God had
   promised. In this way they were admonished, first, to direct their
   attention to the ancient prophecies, and to keep in remembrance,
   especially those which are contained in Isaiah from the fortieth
   chapter (Isaiah 40) to the end of the book; and, secondly, to give ear
   to the servants of God, who at that time preached the kingdom of Jesus
   Christ. Whence it follows that a right judgment cannot be formed of the
   happiness of the Church, except when we estimate it according to the
   standard of God's word.

   Psalm 87:4-6

   4. I will make mention of Rahab, [497] and Babel among them that know
   me: behold the Philistines, and Tyre, with Ethiopia, [498] he is born
   there! [499] Selah. 5. And it shall be said of Zion, Man and man is
   born in her: and the Most High himself will establish her. 6. The Lord
   will recount when he writeth the peoples, he is born there. Selah.


   4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babel. The name of Rahab is put for
   Egypt in many other parts of Scripture; and this signification is very
   suitable to the present passage, the object of which is to portray the
   magnificent amplitude of the Church, which as yet was only matter of
   hope. It is therefore said that those who formerly were deadly enemies,
   or entire strangers, shall not only become familiar friends, but shall
   also be ingrafted into one body, that they may be accounted citizens of
   Jerusalem. In the first clause it is said, I will make mention of Egypt
   and Babylon among my household. In the second, it is added, that the
   Philistines, Tyrians, and Ethiopians, who hitherto had been so much at
   variance with the people of God, shall now be brought into as cordial
   harmony with them as if they were Jews by birth. What a glorious
   distinction of the Church, that even those who held her in contempt
   shall come flocking to her from every quarter, and that those who
   desired to see her completely cut up and destroyed, shall consider it
   the highest honor to have a place among the number of her citizens, and
   to be accounted such! All of them shall voluntarily renounce their own
   countries in which they had before proudly boasted. Wherever they may
   have been born, whether in Palestine, or Ethiopia, or Tyre, they shall
   profess themselves citizens of the holy city.

   The Hebrew doctors explain this passage as meaning, that there shall
   spring from other nations very few who shall excel either in mental
   endowment or in virtuous attainment, but that in Israel such persons
   will be very numerous. Scarcely, say they, will there be found among
   the Tyrians, the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, and other nations, a man to
   each of them worthy of praise; so that if such an one be found among
   them, he may be pointed at with the finger, on account of his rarity;
   but in Zion man and man shall be born; [500] that is to say, the number
   of such men among the Jews shall be great. Christian doctors are almost
   unanimous in referring these words to Christ, and think that the cause
   is here assigned why those who hitherto were strangers, and even mortal
   enemies to each other, are now to be numbered among the citizens of
   Jerusalem, namely, because Christ shall be born there, [501] whose
   office it is to gather together into the unity of faith and hope of
   eternal life, men who were scattered like members torn from the body.
   The first of these interpretations being altogether forced, needs no
   refutation. Moreover, it is very evident that the Jews, actuated by a
   foolish ambition, wrest this passage as it were purposely. The
   exposition of the Christian doctors is, at first sight, plausible from
   its ingenuity; but it is destitute of solidity. The words clearly
   imply, that whatever nation men may belong to, they shall willingly
   renounce their own country, to be enrolled in the Register of the
   chosen people. When it is said, that they are born there, this does not
   mean that they are natives of the country, and have been brought up in
   it from their birth, but that they are its citizens. What is added
   afterwards, The Most High himself will establish her, may, with equal
   propriety, be translated, will order her; it being the work of God
   specially to govern his Church by his word.

   5 And it shall be said of Zion, Man and man is born in her. It is
   asserted, in the 4th verse, That new citizens shall be gathered into
   the Church of God from different parts of the world; and here the same
   subject is prosecuted. Another figure is however employed, which is,
   that strangers by birth shall be accounted among the holy people, just
   as if they were descended from Abraham. It had been stated in the
   preceding verse, that the Chaldeans and Egyptians would be added to the
   household of the Church; and that the Ethiopians, Philistines, and
   Tyrians, would be enrolled among her children. Now, it is added, by way
   of confirmation, that the number of the new progeny shall be exceeding
   great, so that the city which had been for a time uninhabited, and
   afterwards only half filled with a few people, shall be crowded with a
   vast population. The prophet Isaiah describes more at length what is
   here promised, in a few words,

   "Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing,
   and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the
   children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith
   the Lord. Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
   curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and
   strengthen thy stakes: for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and
   on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the
   desolate cities to be inhabited." (Isaiah 54:1)

   Also,

   "Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves
   together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy
   daughters shall be nursed at thy side."
   (Isaiah 60:4)

   And, in the 44th chapter, at the 5th verse, we meet with almost the
   same language as in the passage before us, or at least what comes very
   near to it: "One shall say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call
   himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand
   unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel." Nor is the
   word born inappropriately employed to express the fact, that the
   Egyptians, Chaldeans, and such like, shall be of the flock of God's
   people. Although Zion was not the place of their natural birth, but
   they were to be grafted into the body of the holy people by adoption;
   yet as the way by which we enter into the Church is a second birth,
   this form of expression is used with great propriety. The condition
   upon which Christ espouses the faithful to himself is, that they should
   forget their own people and their father's house, (Psalm 45:11,) and
   that, being formed into new creatures, and born again of incorruptible
   seed, they should begin to be the children of God as well as of the
   Church, (Galatians 4:19.) And the ministry of the Church, and it alone,
   is undoubtedly the means by which we are born again to a heavenly life.
   By the way, we should remember the difference which the Apostle sets
   forth as subsisting between the earthly Jerusalem, -- which, being
   herself a bondwoman, brings forth children also in bondage, -- and the
   heavenly Jerusalem, which brings forth free children by the
   instrumentality of the Gospel.

   In the second part of the verse, there is expressed the stability and
   enduring character of Zion. It often happens, that in proportion to the
   rapidity with which cities rise to distinguished eminence, is the
   shortness of the continuance of their prosperity. That it may not be
   thought that the prosperity of the Church is of such a perishable and
   transitory nature, it is declared, that the Most High himself will
   establish her It is not surprising, as if it had been said, to find
   other cities shaken, and subject from time to time to a variety of
   vicissitudes; for they are carried round with the world in its
   revolutions, and do not enjoy everlasting defenders. But it is the very
   reverse with respect to the new Jerusalem, which, being founded upon
   the power of God, will continue even when heaven and earth shall fall
   into ruins.

   6 The Lord will recount, when he writeth the peoples. The meaning is,
   that Zion will acquire such renown as to excite all men with the
   greatest earnestness to desire to be admitted into the number and rank
   of her citizens. It is a highly honorable condition which is spoken of,
   the language implying, that when God shall take a census of the people
   on whom he will be graciously pleased to confer the highest honor, he
   will write them as belonging to Zion, rather than to Babylon or any
   other cities; for to be one of the common people among the citizens of
   Zion, will be a greater distinction than to be invested with the
   highest rank anywhere else. We are, at the same time, taught that the
   cause to which we are to trace the sudden elevation of these aliens to
   so great honor, is the favor of God. Those who are the bondslaves of
   Satan and of sin will assuredly never be able to obtain, by any efforts
   of their own, the right of citizenship in the heavenly Jerusalem. It is
   the Lord's peculiar work to divide people into their respective ranks,
   distinguishing one from another, as seemeth good to him, all men being
   on a level by nature. This passage is to be understood as referring to
   effectual calling. God, it is true, wrote the names of his children in
   the Book of Life before the creation of the world; but he enrols them
   in the catalogue of his saints, only when, having regenerated them by
   the Spirit of adoption, he impresses his own mark upon them.

   [497] Warner, who adopts this opinion, observes: -- "Though the hills
   round about Jerusalem (Psalm 125:2) were all holy, from their proximity
   to the holy city, yet those of Zion and Moriah (Psalm 48:2) were more
   especially so, as on them were built the tabernacle, the palace of
   David, and the temple of Solomon."

   [498] Rahab is a poetical name of Egypt, (Isaiah 30:7; 51:9; Psalm
   87:4; 89:11.) It signifies pride or fierceness, and seems to have been
   given to Egypt by the Jews, in memorial of the cruel tyranny which had
   been exercised over them by the Egyptians during their bondage among
   that people.

   Psalm 87:7

   7. And the singers as the players upon instruments: all my springs are
   in thee. [502]


   The meaning of this verse is obscure, partly from its abrupt brevity,
   and partly from the ambiguity of one word. The word springs is, beyond
   all controversy, to be here taken metaphorically; but interpreters are
   not agreed as to the explanation of the metaphor. Some understand it as
   denoting hopes, some affections, and others thoughts. Did the idiom of
   the language admit, I would willingly subscribe to the opinion of those
   who translate it melodies or songs. But as this might be considered
   unsupported by the usage of the Hebrew term, I am rather inclined to
   adopt, as most suitable to the subject in hand, the opinion that
   lookings is the proper translation, the root of the word signifying an
   eye. It is as if the Psalmist had said, I will always be earnestly
   looking, as it were, with fixed eyes upon thee.

   Let us now inquire what is meant by the other clause, The singers as
   the players upon instruments. This, it is true, is an abrupt form of
   expression; but the sense, about which there is a general agreement,
   is, that so great will be the ground for rejoicing, that the praises of
   God will resound in Zion continually, with the energy of the living
   voice, as well as with musical instruments. This, then, is a
   confirmation of what was spoken before concerning the glorious
   restoration of Zion; for by the greatness of the joy, and the manifold
   harmony and melody of praises, is portrayed the happiness which shall
   prevail in the midst of it. At the same time, we have here described
   the great design of all the gifts which God has conferred upon his
   Church with so liberal a hand; namely, that the faithful, by hymns and
   songs, should testify their remembrance of his benefits and gratefully
   acknowledge them. [503] The Hebrew word chvllym, cholelim, which we
   have rendered the players upon instruments, is translated by some,
   those who dance to the sound of instruments. [504] But this is a matter
   of no great importance, it being enough to consider the meaning, in
   short, as this, that there will be a continual concert of God's praises
   in the Church, where he unfolds the treasures of his grace, and that
   the faithful will be heard singing successively and in response.
   Moreover, the prophet shows his singular love to the Church, and the
   singular care and zeal which he exercised about her, to encourage and
   stir up all the godly, by his example, to cultivate and manifest the
   same zeal, agreeably to what is stated in another psalm,

   "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem! let my right hand forget her cunning.
   If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
   mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy." (Psalm 137:5)

   All our affections are then settled on the Church, when, gathered in
   from the vague and vain objects by which they are distracted, and
   regarding with indifference the honors, pleasures, riches, and
   pageantries of the world, they find enough to engage and satisfy them
   in the spiritual glory of Christ's kingdom, and in that alone.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [502] Horsley, who takes this view, translates -- "And every one shall
   say of Zion,
   He was born there:" on which he has the following note: --
   "Unusquisque, every one. Every one shall confess, to the honor of the
   Israelites, that the Savior was a native Jew." Dimock objects to this,
   observing that Christ was not born at Jerusalem.

   [503] Cresswell connects the second clause of this verse with the
   first, in this manner: -- "Singers also, and players upon the pipe,
   shall chant, All my wells are in thee;'" i.e., says he, "all my sources
   of refreshment, of hope, and of salvation, are in thee, O Zion!" He
   adds, "The phrase, wells of salvation, occurs in Isaiah 12:3, the
   Hebrew word being the same as that which, in our two English versions
   of the Psalms, is translated springs and fountains." Walford connects
   the two clauses in the same manner, "They sing with musical
   instruments, All my springs are in thee.'" "The persons who are here
   said to sing," he observes, "accompanied by musical instruments, are
   the people spoken of in verse 6. They are described as uniting in a
   joyful song of praise and thanksgiving; and the burden of their song
   is, All my springs are in thee.' Springs or fountains are a constant
   image for the blessings which are productive of refreshment and
   happiness. These new-born converts are, therefore, represented as
   joining the universal Church, and offering ascriptions of praise to
   God, who is the overflowing source of all the streams of good, which
   refresh and bless the people."

   PSALM 88

   This psalm contains very grievous lamentations, poured forth by its
   inspired penman when under very severe affliction, and almost at the
   point of despair. But he, at the same time, whilst struggling with
   sorrow, declares the invincible steadfastness of his faith; which he
   displayed in calling upon God to deliver him, even when he was in the,
   deep darkness of death. [505]

   A Song or Psalm of the sons of Korah. To the chief musician upon
   Machalath, to make humble. An instruction of Heman, the Ezrahite.

   Heman, whose name appears in the inscription, is probably the same
   person who is mentioned in sacred history, 1 Kings 4:31, where Solomon,
   when commended for his wisdom, is compared with Ethan, Heman, Chalcol,
   and Darda. [506] It is, therefore, not surprising that a man, so highly
   distinguished by the spirit of wisdom, was the author of this psalm.
   Some translate l-mhlt, al-machalath, upon infirmity; [507] but it is
   probable, according to the ordinary use of the word, that it denotes
   either some instrument of music, or the beginning of some song. [508]
   Of the other words I have already sufficiently spoken elsewhere.
   Moreover, it is of importance to bear in mind, that in the person of
   one man there is presented to our view an example at once of rare
   affliction and of singular patience. God, in so sorely exercising
   Heman, whom he had adorned with such excellent gifts to be an example
   to others, did not do this for the sake of his servant only. His object
   was to present common matter of instruction to all his people. Carrying
   out this object, Heman ascending, as it were, an elevated stage,
   testifies to the whole Church his infirmities as well as his faith and
   constancy. It greatly concerns us to look upon such a distinguished
   servant of God, and one who was so eminently adorned with the graces of
   the Holy Spirit, thus overwhelmed with so heavy a burden of afflictions
   as made him mournfully complain that he differed nothing from a dead
   man, -- it greatly concerns us, I say, to look on this spectacle, that
   our distresses, however grievous, may not overwhelm us with despair; or
   if we should at times be ready to faint through weariness, care, grief,
   sorrow, or fear, that we may not on that account despond, especially
   when we see that it is not without the highest effort that the holy
   prophet emerges from this profound darkness into the cheering light of
   hope. We should rather rest assured that the Spirit of God, by the
   mouth of Heman, has here furnished us with a form of prayer for
   encouraging all the afflicted who are, as it were, on the brink of
   despair to come to himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 88:1-5

   1. O Jehovah! God of my salvation! I cry day and night before thee. 2.
   Let my prayer come into thy presence: incline thy ear to my cry; 3. For
   my soul is filled with troubles; and my life is drawing near to the
   grave. 4. I am numbered with them that go down to the pit: I have been
   as a man who hath no strength: 5. Free among the dead, like the slain
   who lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more, and who are cut
   off from thy hand.


   1 O Jehovah! God of my salvation! Let me call upon you particularly to
   notice what I have just now stated, that although the prophet simply,
   and without hyperbole, recites the agony which he suffered from the
   greatness of his sorrows, yet his purpose was at the same time to
   supply the afflicted with a form of prayer that they might not faint
   under any adversities, however severe, which might befall them. We will
   hear him by and by bursting out into vehement complaints on account of
   the grievousness of his calamities; but he seasonably fortifies himself
   by this brief exordium, lest, carried away with the heat of his
   feelings, he might become chargeable with complaining and murmuring
   against God, instead of humbly supplicating Him for pardon. By applying
   to Him the appellation of the God of his salvation, casting, as it
   were, a bridle upon himself, he restrains the excess of his sorrow,
   shuts the door against despair, and strengthens and prepares himself
   for the endurance of the cross. When he speaks of his crying and
   importunity, he indicates the earnestness of soul with which he engaged
   in prayer. He may not, indeed, have given utterance to loud cries; but
   he uses the word cry, with much propriety', to denote the great
   earnestness of his prayers. The same thing is implied when he tells us
   that he continued crying days and nights. Nor are the words before thee
   superfluous. It is common for all men to complain when under the
   pressure of grief; but they are far from pouring out their groanings
   before God. Instead of this, the majority of mankind court retirement,
   that they may murmur against him, and accuse him of undue severity;
   while others pour forth their cries into the air at random. Hence we
   gather that it is a rare virtue to set God before our eyes, that we may
   address our prayers to him.

   3 For my soul is filled with troubles. These words contain the excuse
   which the prophet pleads for the excess of his grief. They imply that
   his continued crying did not proceed from softness or effeminacy of
   spirit, but that from a due consideration of his condition, it would be
   found that the immense accumulation of miseries with which he was
   oppressed was such as might justly extort from him these lamentations.
   Nor does he speak of one kind of calamity only; but of calamities so
   heaped one upon another that his heart was filled with sorrow, till it
   could contain no more. He next particularly affirms that his life was
   not far from the grave. This idea he pursues and expresses in terms
   more significant in the following verse, where he complains that he
   was, as it were, dead. Although he breathed still among the living, yet
   the many deaths with which he was threatened on all sides were to him
   so many graves by which he expected to be swallowed up in a moment. And
   he seems to use the word gvr, geber, which is derived from gvr, gabar,
   he prevailed, or was strong, [509] in preference to the word which
   simply signifies man, -- the more emphatically to show that his
   distresses were so great and crushing as to have been sufficient to
   bring down the strongest man.

   5 Free among the dead, lie the slain who lie in the grave. The prophet
   intended to express something more distressing and grievous than common
   death. First, he says, that he was free among the dead, because he was
   rendered unfit for all the business which engages human life, and, as
   it were, cut off from the world. The refined interpretation of
   Augustine, that Christ is here described, and that he is said to be
   free among the dead, because he obtained the victory over death by a
   special privilege, that it might not have dominion over him, has no
   connection with the meaning of the passage. [510] The prophet is rather
   to be understood as affirming, that having finished the course of this
   present life, his mind had become disengaged from all worldly
   solicitude; his afflictions having deprived him of all feeling. [511]
   In the next place, comparing himself with those who have been wounded,
   he bewails his condition as worse than if, enfeebled by calamities, he
   were going down to death by little and little; for we are naturally
   inspired with horror at the prospect of a violent death.

   What he adds, that he is forgotten of God, and cut off from his hand or
   guardianship, is apparently harsh and improper, since it is certain
   that the dead are no less under the Divine protection than the living.
   Even wicked Balaam, whose purpose it was to turn light into darkness,
   was, nevertheless, constrained to cry out,

   "Let me die the death of the righteous,
   and let my last end be like his," (Numbers 23:10.)

   To say, then, that God is no longer mindful of man after he is dead,
   might seem to be the language of a heathen. To this it may be answered,
   That the prophet speaks according to the opinion of the generality of
   men; just as the Scriptures, in like manner, when treating of the
   providence of God, accommodate their style to the state of the world as
   presented to the eye, because our thoughts ascend only by slow degrees
   to the future and invisible world. I, however, think, that he rather
   gave utterance to those confused conceptions which arise in the mind of
   a man under affliction, than that he had an eye to the opinion of the
   ignorant and uninstructed part of mankind. Nor is it wonderful that a
   man endued with the Spirit of God was, as it were, so stunned and
   stupified when sorrow overmastered him, as to allow unadvised words to
   escape from his lips. Although faith in the truth that God extends his
   care both to the living and the dead is deeply rooted in the hearts of
   all his genuine servants, yet sorrow often so overclouds their minds as
   to exclude from them for the time all remembrance of his providence.
   From perusing the complaints of Job, we may perceive, that when the
   minds of the godly are preoccupied with sorrow, they do not immediately
   pierce to the consideration of the secret providence of God, which yet
   has been before the subject of their careful meditation, and the truth
   of which they bear engraven on their hearts. Although the prophet,
   then, was persuaded that the dead also are under the Divine protection,
   yet, in the first paroxysm of his grief, he spoke less advisedly than
   he ought to have done; for the light of faith was, as it were,
   extinguished in him, although, as we shall see, it soon after shone
   forth. This it will be highly useful particularly to observe, that,
   should we be at any time weakened by temptation, we may, nevertheless,
   be kept from falling into despondency or despair.

   denote some musical instrument of the plaintive order; and in this
   opinion Kimchi and other Jewish writers perfectly agree. They assert
   that it was a wind-instrument, answering very much to the flute, and
   employed mainly in giving utterance to sentiments of grief, upon
   occasions of great sorrow and lamentation."

   chose. The dead are bound in the grave: He was free, and not obliged to
   continue in that state as they were."

   Psalm 88:6-9

   6. Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps.
   7. Thy indignation lieth heavy upon me; and thou hast afflicted me with
   all thy waves. Selah. 8. Thou hast removed my acquaintances from me:
   thou hast made me to be abhorred by them: I am shut up that I cannot go
   forth. 9. My eye mourneth because of my affliction; I invoke thee, O
   Jehovah! daily: I stretch out my hands to thee.


   6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit. The Psalmist now acknowledges
   more distinctly, that whatever adversities he endured proceeded from
   the Divine hand. Nor indeed will any man sincerely betake himself to
   God to seek relief without a previous persuasion that it is the Divine
   hand which smites him, and that nothing happens by chance. It is
   observable that the nearer the prophet approaches God the more is his
   grief embittered; for nothing is more dreadful to the saints than the
   judgment of God.

   Some translate the first clause of the 7th verse, Thy indignation hath
   approached upon me; and the Hebrew word smk, samach, is sometimes to be
   taken in this sense. But from the scope of the passage, it must
   necessarily be understood here, as in many other places, in the sense
   of to surround, or to lie heavy upon; for when the subject spoken of is
   a man sunk into a threefold grave, it would be too feeble to speak of
   the wrath of God as merely approaching him. The translation which I
   have adopted is peculiarly suitable to the whole drift of the text. It
   views the prophet as declaring, that he sustained the whole burden of
   God's wrath; seeing he was afflicted with His waves. Farther, as so
   dreadful a flood did not prevent him from lifting up his heart and
   prayers to God, we may learn from his example to cast the anchor of our
   faith and prayers direct into heaven in all the perils of shipwreck to
   which we may be exposed.

   8 Thou hast removed my acquaintances from me. He was now destitute of
   all human aid, and that also he attributes to the anger of God, in
   whose power it is either to bend the hearts of men to humanity, or to
   harden them, and render them cruel. This is a point well worthy of our
   attention; for unless we bear in mind that our destitution of human aid
   in any case is owing to God's withdrawing his hand, we agitate
   ourselves without end or measure. We may indeed justly complain of the
   ingratitude or cruelty of men whenever they defraud us of the just
   claims of duty which we have upon them; but still this will avail us
   nothing, unless we are thoroughly convinced that God, being displeased
   with us, takes away the means of help which he had destined for us;
   just as it is easy for him, whenever he pleases, to incline the hearts
   of all men to stretch forth their hand to succor us. The prophet, as an
   additional and still more grievous element in his distressed condition,
   tells us that his friends abhorred him. [512] Finally, he concludes by
   observing, that he could perceive no way of escape from his calamities:
   I am shut up that I cannot go forth. [513]

   9. My eye mourneth because of my affliction. To prevent it from being
   supposed that he was iron-hearted, he again repeats that his
   afflictions were so severe and painful as to produce manifest traces of
   his sorrow, even in his countenance and eyes -- a plain indication of
   the low condition to which he was reduced. But he, notwithstanding,
   testifies that he was not drawn away from God, like many who, secretly
   murmuring in their hearts, and, to use a proverbial expression, chafing
   upon the bit, have nothing farther from their thoughts than to
   disburden their cares into the bosom of God, in order to derive comfort
   from Him. In speaking of the stretching out of his hands, he puts the
   sign for the thing signified. I have elsewhere had an opportunity of
   explaining the import of this ceremony, which has been in common use in
   all ages.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [512] This verse has been supposed to contain a reference to the
   condition of the leper under the law, which much resembled the picture
   here drawn. chphsy, chophshi, from chphs, chophash, "is free," says
   Hammond, ("in opposition to servitude,) manumitted, set at liberty The
   use of this word may more generally be taken from 2 Chronicles 26:21,
   where of Uzziah, being a leper, it is said, that he dwelt, vyt
   hchphsyt, in an house of freedom, for he was cut off from the house of
   the Lord.' The meaning is, that after the manner of the lepers, he was
   excluded from the temple, and dwelt, vr mn yrvslm, saith the Chaldee,
   there, in some place without Jerusalem, which is therefore called the
   house of freedom,' because such as were there were exempt from the
   common affairs, and shut up from the conversation of men. And in
   comparison with these, they that are, as it were, dead and laid in
   their graves, are here said to be free, i e., removed from all the
   affairs and conversation of the world."

   [513] "This verse," observes Dr Adam Clarke, "has been supposed to
   express the state of a leper, who, because of the infectious nature of
   his disease, is separated from his family, -- is abominable to all, and
   at last shut up in a separate house, whence he does not come out to
   mingle with society." "Heman means," says Walford, "either that the
   character of his disease was such that men could not endure to be near
   him, or that the state of his mind was so disordered that he became
   wearisome and intolerable; perhaps he includes both."

   Psalm 88:10-13

   10. Wilt thou perform a miracle for the dead? shall the dead [514]
   arise to praise thee? Selah. 11. Shall thy loving kindness be declared
   in the grave? thy truth in destruction? [515] 12. Shall thy wonders be
   known in darkness? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
   13. But to thee have I cried, O Jehovah! and in the morning my prayer
   shall come before thee. [516]


   10. Wilt thou perform a miracle for the dead? By these words the
   prophet intimates, that God, if he did not make haste to succor him,
   would be too late, there being scarce anything betwixt him and death;
   and that therefore this was the critical juncture, if God was inclined
   to help him, for should the present opportunity not be embraced another
   would not occur. He asks how long God meant to delay, -- if he meant to
   do so till death intervened, that he might raise the dead by a miracle?
   He does not speak of the resurrection at the last day, which will
   surpass all other miracles, as if he called it in question; yet he
   cannot be vindicated from the charge of going to excess, for it does
   not belong to us to prescribe to God the season of succouring us. We
   impeach his power if we believe not that it is as easy for him to
   restore life to the dead as to prevent, in proper season, the extreme
   danger which may threaten us from actually lighting upon us. Great as
   has been the constancy of the saints, it has always had some mixture of
   the infirmity of the flesh, which has rendered it necessary for God, in
   the exercise of his fatherly clemency, to bear with the sin with which
   even their very virtues have been to a degree contaminated. When the
   Psalmist asks, Shall thy loving-kindness be declared in the grave? he
   does not mean that the dead are devoid of consciousness; but he pursues
   the same sentiment which he had previously stated, That it is a more
   seasonable time to succor men, whilst in the midst of danger they are
   as yet crying, than to raise them up from their graves when they are
   dead. He reasons from what ordinarily happens; it not being God's usual
   way to bring the dead out of their graves to be witnesses and
   publishers of his goodness. To God's loving-kindness or mercy he
   annexes his truth or faithfulness; for when God delivers his servants
   he gives a confirmation of his faithfulness to his promises. And, on
   the other hand, he is influenced to make his promises by nothing but
   his own pure goodness. When the prophet affirms, that the divine
   faithfulness as well as the divine goodness, power, and righteousness,
   are not known in the land of forgetfulness, some deluded persons
   foolishly wrest the statement to support a gross error, as if it taught
   that men were annihilated by death. He speaks only of the ordinary
   manner in which help is extended by God, who has designed this world to
   be as a stage on which to display his goodness towards mankind.

   13. But to thee have I cried, O Jehovah! There may have been a degree
   of intemperateness in the language of the prophet, which, as I have
   granted, cannot be altogether vindicated; but still it was a sign of
   rare faith and piety to persevere as he did with never-failing
   earnestness in prayer. This is what is meant when he says, that he made
   haste in the morning; by which he would have us not to imagine that he
   slowly and coldly lingered till he was constrained by dire necessity.
   At the same time, he modestly intimates by these words, that his pining
   away in long continued miseries was not owing to his own sluggishness,
   as if he had not sought God. This is an example particularly worthy of
   notice, that we may not become discouraged if it happen sometimes that
   our prayers are for a time unsuccessful, although they may proceed from
   the heart, and may be assiduously persevered in.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [514] According to Cresswell, the meaning of this clause is, "That the
   Psalmist confined himself to his house from the fear of encountering,
   if he were abroad, the revilings of his former friends." Walford
   explains it as follows -- "Either his state of feeling was such as
   induced him to withdraw himself altogether from society, or he was so
   environed by hopeless misery, that he regarded himself as a wretch
   confined in a dungeon, whence he could not escape." Horsley reads, "I
   am shut up apart, and am not permitted to come out." He observes, that
   shut up apart is the proper sense of kl', and adds, that "when it
   denotes confinement, it always implies solitary confinement."

   [515] The Hebrew word for the dead, in the first clause of the verse,
   is mtym, methim; here it is rph'ym, rephaim This last "Hebrew word,"
   says Parkhurst, "means dead bodies reduced,' or resolved into their
   original dust.' I know not (he adds) of any one English word that will
   express it: remains, or relics, come as near to it as any that I can
   recollect. It is several times put after mtym, the dead,' as of more
   intense signification." (See Parkhurst's Lexicon,rph', 2.) "Mortui, qui
   vivere desierunt, manes, proprie flaccidi." -- Simonis According to Dr
   Adam Clarke, rph'ym, rephaim, means "the manes or departed spirits."
   The Chaldee paraphrases this word "the carcases that are putrefied in
   the dust."

   [516] "C'est, la mort." -- Fr. marg. "That is, death."

   Psalm 88:14-18

   14. Wherefore, O Jehovah! wilt thou reject my soul? and hide thy face
   from me? 15. I am afflicted, and ready to die from my youth; I have
   suffered thy terrors by doubting. 16. Thy wraths have passed over me:
   thy terrors have cut me off. 17. They have daily encompassed me like
   waters: they have surrounded me together. 18. Thou hast put far from me
   friend and companion: and my acquaintances are darkness. [517]


   14. Wherefore, O Jehovah! wilt thou reject my soul? These lamentations
   at first sight would seem to indicate a state of mind in which sorrow
   without any consolation prevailed; but they contain in them tacit
   prayers. The Psalmist does not proudly enter into debate with God, but
   mournfully desires some remedy to his calamities. This kind of
   complaint justly deserves to be reckoned among the unutterable
   groanings of which Paul makes mention in Romans 8:26. Had the prophet
   thought himself rejected and abhorred by God, he certainly would not
   have persevered in prayer. But here he sets forth the judgment of the
   flesh, against which he strenuously and magnanimously struggled, that
   it might at length be manifest from the result that he had not prayed
   in vain. Although, therefore, this psalm does not end with
   thanksgiving, but with a mournful complaint, as if there remained no
   place for mercy, yet it is so much the more useful as a means of
   keeping us in the duty of prayer. The prophet, in heaving these sighs,
   and discharging them, as it were, into the bosom of God, doubtless
   ceased not to hope for the salvation of which he could see no signs by
   the eye of sense. He did not call God, at the opening of the psalm, the
   God of his salvation, and then bid farewell to all hope of succor from
   him.

   The reason why he says that he was ready to die [518] from his youth,
   (verse 15,) is uncertain, unless it may be considered a probable
   conjecture that he was severely tried in a variety of ways, so that his
   life, as it were, hung by a thread amidst various tremblings and fears.
   Whence also we gather that God's wraths and terrors, of which he speaks
   in the 16th verse, were not of short continuance. He expresses them in
   the 17th verse as having encompassed him daily. Since nothing is more
   dreadful than to conceive of God as angry with us, he not improperly
   compares his distress to a flood. Hence also proceeded his doubting.
   [519] for a sense of the divine anger must necessarily have agitated
   his mind with sore disquietude. But it may be asked, How can this
   wavering agree with faith? It is true, that when the heart is in
   perplexity and doubt, or rather is tossed hither and thither, faith
   seems to be swallowed up. But experience teaches us, that faith, while
   it fluctuates amidst these agitations, continues to rise again from
   time to time, so as not to be overwhelmed; and if at any time it is at
   the point of being stifled, it is nevertheless sheltered and cherished,
   for though the tempests may become never so violent, it shields itself
   from them by reflecting that God continues faithful, and never
   disappoints or forsakes his own children.

   [518] "C'est, se cachent." -- Fr. marg. "That is, hide themselves."
   Walford reads, "The darkness of death is my associate;" on which he has

   [519] The original word for "ready to die" is gv, goveang It is
   literally, I labour, or pant for breath, I breathe with pain and
   difficulty, as a person in great affliction and distress. The verb
   sometimes signifies to expire; but it does not so strictly express as
   imply death, from the obstruction of breathing that accompanies it.

   [505] "As well the singers as players, or dancers, shall be there; i
   e., the whole chorus of joy and praise. Dr Chandler renders it, They
   shall sing like those that lead up the dance;' i e., with joy and
   exultation." -- Williams Symmachus and Aquila translate the text:--
   ...Kai hadontes hos choroi, pasai pegai en soi:"And they shall sing as
   in leading up a dance; All my fountains are in thee.'"

   [506] There are various opinions as to the occasion of the composition
   of this psalm. Dr Kennicott conceives it to be the prayer of a person
   shut up in a separate house because of the leprosy, who seems to have
   been in the last stage of that distemper; this disease, under the
   Mosaic dispensation, having been supposed to come from the immediate
   stroke of God. Kimchi is of opinion that it was written in the name of
   the Jewish people during the captivity, in the language of a poor slave
   under his chains. Bishop Patrick supposes that Heman, the author of it,
   was during the same period cast into a dark prison, (see verses 5, 6,)
   or, that he was otherwise as miserably treated, as if he had been in a
   dungeon; and that he here bewails his private calamity.

   [507] The Heman mentioned in that text has been supposed by some to be
   the son of Zerah, one of Judah's sons, by his daughter-in-law Tamar,
   spoken of in 1 Chronicles 2:6. If these two passages refer to the same
   persons, then as the grandchildren of Judah are called in 1 Kings 4:31,
   the sons of Mahol, it would follow that Mahol was either another name
   of Zerah or the name of his wife. If this Heman was the author of the
   psalm before us, and if Ethan, his brother, wrote the subsequent psalm,
   as they lived at least one hundred and seventy years before Moses,
   these poems are the oldest poetical compositions extant, and the most
   ancient part of divine revelation. This, however, is far from being
   certain. Heman, the grandson of Judah, may have been the author of the
   78th psalm; but the 79th could not have been written by Ethan, his
   brother, as it speaks of transactions that took place long after his
   time, at least as late as the days of David, who is particularly
   mentioned in it. Calvin obviously considers this Heman to have lived in
   the time of David or Solomon. There is a person of the same name who
   was constituted by David one of the chiefs of the sacred singers, 1
   Chronicles 25:1. But he was a Levite, whereas the present Heman is
   called an Ezrahite, which is understood to denote a descendant from
   Zerah, the son of Judah. If, therefore, the chief musician in the time
   of David be intended, some transcriber must have erroneously applied to
   him the term Ezrahite. But if the psalm, as is supposed by many, was
   written during the Babylonish captivity, it must have been written by a
   different person.

   [508] Street renders the title, "An instructive psalm in sickness,
   through affliction, by Aiman, the Ezrahite." He observes, "mchlh,
   sickness, is used, Exodus 23:25. The word mhlt, is the construct form
   of it." He adds -- "The title thus translated agrees with the matter
   contained in the psalm."
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 89

   The prophet who wrote this psalm, whoever he was, in approaching the
   throne of grace to make supplication to God in behalf of the afflicted
   Church, lays down, as an encouragement both to himself and the rest of
   the faithful to cherish good hope, the covenant which God had made with
   David. He then adverts in general to the Divine power which is
   discerned in the whole government of the world. And next, he calls to
   remembrance the redemption in which God had given an everlasting
   testimony of his fatherly love towards his chosen people. Thence, he
   again returns to the covenant made with David, in which God had
   promised to continue his favor towards that people for ever, for the
   sake of their king. Finally, he subjoins a complaint that God, as if he
   had forgotten his covenant, abandoned his Church to the will of her
   enemies, and, in the midst of strange disaster and mournful desolation,
   withheld all succor and consolation.

   An instruction of Ethan, the Ezrahite.

   Who this Ethan was, to whom this psalm is ascribed, is somewhat
   uncertain. If we should consider him to have been one of the four
   eminent men to whom Solomon is compared for his distinguished wisdom,
   (1 Kings 4:31) [520] the argument or subject of the poem will not agree
   with his time; unless we suppose him to have survived Solomon, and
   bewailed the sad and mournful division which occurred after the death
   of that monarch, and which proved the commencement and prelude of
   future ruin. The people, it is true, after being divided into two
   kingdoms, continued still to exist safe as before; but as that rupture
   dissolved the unity established by God, what ground of hope could any
   longer remain? Besides, the prosperity and welfare of the whole body
   depended upon their having one head, from their allegiance to whom the
   ten tribes had wickedly revolted. What a horrible spectacle was it to
   behold that kingdom, which might have flourished in unimpaired vigor,
   even to the end of the world, disfigured and miserably rent asunder, at
   the close of the life of one man! Who would not have thought that the
   holy oracle was deceptive and vain, the truth of which seemed to be
   overthrown in so short a time? If, therefore, the Ethan above referred
   to should be regarded as the author of this psalm, the complaints
   contained in it must be applied to that period, in which not only the
   throne of David was weakened, but in which also the great mass of the
   people apostatised from God, while those who were brethren proceeded to
   work each other's ruin by mutual and intestine discord. This certainly
   appears to me to be the most probable conjecture in this doubtful case.
   Some think that the author, speaking under the influence of the Spirit
   of prophecy, predicts the calamities which were to befall the people:
   but this opinion may be easily refuted by the context itself, where the
   inspired bard expressly bewails the first unhappy alteration which took
   place in the kingdom, in consequence of the conspiracy of Jeroboam.

   Psalm 89:1-4

   1. I will sing of the mercies of Jehovah for ever: with my mouth will I
   celebrate thy truth from generation to generation. 2. For I have said,
   Mercy shall be built up for ever: thou shalt establish the heavens, thy
   truth is in them. [521] 3. I have made a covenant with my chosen: I
   have sworn to David my servant, 4. I will establish thy seed for ever,
   and will build up thy throne from age to age. Selah.


   1 I will sing of the mercies of Jehovah for ever. It must be borne in
   mind, as I have just now observed, that the Psalmist opens with the
   praises of God, and with calling to mind the Divine covenant, to
   encourage the faithful to strengthen their faith against the formidable
   assaults of temptation. If when we set about the duty of prayer some
   despairing thought, at the very outset, presents itself to us, we must
   forcibly and resolutely break through it, lest our hearts faint and
   utterly fail. The design of the prophet, therefore, was to fortify the
   minds of the godly at the very commencement, with stable and
   substantial supports, that, relying on the Divine promise, which, to
   outward appearance, had almost fallen to the ground, and repelling all
   the assaults of temptation with which their faith was severely shaken,
   they might with confidence hope for the re-establishment of the
   kingdom, and continue perseveringly to pray for this blessing. From the
   sad spectacle of begun decay, [522] which Ethan beheld, listening to
   the dictates of carnal reason, he might have thought that both himself
   and the rest of God's believing people were deceived; but he expresses
   his determination to celebrate the mercies of God which at that time
   were hidden from his view. And as it was no easy matter for him to
   apprehend and acknowledge the merciful character of God, of whose
   severity he had actual experience, he uses the plural number, the
   Mercies of God, that by reflecting on the abundance and variety of the
   blessings of Divine grace he might overcome this temptation.

   2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever. He assigns the
   reason why he perseveres in singing the Divine praises in the midst of
   adversities; which is, that he does not despair of the manifestation of
   God's loving-kindness towards his people, although at present they were
   under severe chastisement. Never will a man freely open his mouth to
   praise God, unless he is fully persuaded that God, even when he is
   angry with his people, never lays aside his fatherly affection towards
   them. The words I have said, imply that the truth which the inspired
   writer propounds was deeply fixed in his heart. [523] Whatever, as if
   he had said, has hitherto happened, it has never had the effect of
   effacing from my heart the undoubted hope of experiencing the Divine
   favor as to the future, and I will always continue steadfastly to
   cherish the same feeling. It is to be observed, that it was not without
   a painful and arduous conflict that he succeeded in embracing by faith
   the goodness of God, which at that time had entirely vanished out of
   sight; -- this we say is to be particularly noticed, in order that when
   God at any time withdraws from us all the tokens of his love, we may
   nevertheless learn to erect in our hearts that everlasting building of
   mercy, which is here spoken of, -- a metaphor, by which is meant that
   the Divine mercy shall be extended, or shall continue till it reach its
   end or consummation. In the second clause of the verse something must
   be supplied. The sense, in short, is, that the Divine promise is no
   less stable than the settled course of the heavens, which is eternal
   and exempt from all change. By the word heavens I understand not only
   the visible skies, but the heavens which are above the whole frame of
   the world; for the truth of God, in the heavenly glory of his kingdom,
   is placed above all the elements of the world.

   3 I have made a covenant with my chosen. [524] The more effectually to
   confirm himself and all the godly in the faith of the Divine promise,
   he introduces God himself as speaking and sanctioning, by his
   authority, what had been said in the preceding verse. As faith ought to
   depend on the Divine promise, this manner of speaking, by which God is
   represented as coming forward and alluring us to himself by his own
   voice, is more forcible than if the prophet himself had simply stated
   the fact. And when God in this way anticipates us, we cannot be charged
   with rashness in coming familiarly to him; even as, on the contrary,
   without His word we have no ground to presume that he will be gracious
   to us, or to hope, at the mere suggestion of our own fancy, for what he
   has not promised. Moreover, the truth of the promise is rendered still
   more irrefragable, when God declares that he had made a covenant with
   his servant David, ratified by his own solemn oath. It having been
   customary in ancient times to engrave leagues and covenants on tables
   of brass, a metaphor is here used borrowed from this practice. God
   applies to David two titles of distinction, calling him both his chosen
   and his servant. Those who would refer the former appellation to
   Abraham do not sufficiently attend to the style of the Book of Psalms,
   in which it is quite common for one thing to be repeated twice. David
   is called the chosen of God, because God of his own good pleasure, and
   from no other cause, preferred him not only to the posterity of Saul,
   and many distinguished personages, but even to his own brethren. If,
   therefore, the cause or origin of this covenant is sought for, we must
   necessarily fall back upon the Divine election.

   The name of servant, which follows immediately after, is not to be
   understood as implying that David by his services merited any thing at
   the hand of God. He is called God's servant in respect of the royal
   dignity, into which he had not rashly thrust himself, having been
   invested with the government by God, and having undertaken it in
   obedience to his lawful call. When, however, we consider what the
   covenant summarily contains, we conclude that the prophet has not
   improperly applied it to his own use, and to the use of the whole
   people; for God did not enter into it with David individually, but had
   an eye to the whole body of the Church, which would exist from age to
   age. The sentence, I will establish thy throne for ever, is partly to
   be understood of Solomon, and the rest of David's successors; but the
   prophet well knew that perpetuity or everlasting duration, in the
   strict and proper sense, could be verified only in Christ. In ordaining
   one man to be king, God assuredly did not have a respect to one house
   alone, while he forgot and neglected the people with whom he had before
   made his covenant in the person of Abraham; but he conferred the
   sovereign power upon David and his children, that they might rule for
   the common good of all the rest, until the throne might be truly
   established by the advent of Christ.

   [521] The Ethan celebrated in that passage, according to some, is the
   same person who is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:6, as the grandson of
   Judah. (See [20]page 406, note 2.) But that this psalm could not have
   been written by him is evident, as we have there observed, from several
   allusions contained in it to events which happened even posterior to
   the days of David. A person of this name was one of the chief musicians
   in the time of David, (1 Chronicles 25:1,) but he was a Levite; whereas
   this Ethan is called an Ezrahite. Nichols thinks it probable that the
   author, like Heman, was of the family of Zerah, and wrote this psalm
   during the captivity, most likely in the time of Jehoiakim, whose
   misfortunes he seems here to describe in a spirit of despondency,
   notwithstanding the promises made to David.

   [522] Ainsworth's translation of this last clause is both literal and
   elegant. "The heavens, thou wilt establish thy faithfulness in them."
   Dr Kennicott, in his Remarks on Select Passages of the Old Testament,
   here refers to verses 37, 38, "where," says he, "it appears that the
   sun, the moon, and the bow in the sky, were the tokens of confirmation
   given by God to the covenant made with David." "The meaning of this
   passage," says Warner, "appears to be, that the constancy of the
   celestial motions, the regular vicissitudes of day and night, and
   alternations of the seasons, were emblems of God's own immutability."

   [524] "The word 'mrty, I have said,' is used, in the Book of Psalms, to

   second verse in his own person, and introduces not God speaking till
   the next verse." -- Horsley

   Psalm 89:5-8

   5. And the heavens shall praise thy wondrous work, O Jehovah! thy truth
   [525] also in the congregation of the saints. 6. For who in the clouds
   [or in heaven] can be compared to Jehovah? who among the sons of the
   gods [526] is like to Jehovah? 7. God is very terrible [527] in the
   assembly of the saints, and to be feared above all who are around him.
   8. O Jehovah! God of Hosts, who is a strong God as thou art? and thy
   truth is round about thee.


   5. And the heavens shall praise thy wondrous work. The prophet, having
   spoken of God's covenant, even as faith ought to begin at the word, now
   descends to a general commendation of his works. It is, however, to be
   observed, that when he treats of the wonderful power of God, he has no
   other end in view than to exalt and magnify more highly the holiness of
   the covenant. He exclaims, that this is the God who has rightful claims
   to be served and feared, who ought to be believed, and upon whose power
   the most unhesitating confidence may be reposed. The words wondrous
   work, in the first clause, I would therefore limit to the power which
   God displays in preserving and maintaining his Church. The heavens, it
   is true, are most excellent witnesses and preachers of God's wonderful
   power; but from attending to the scope of the passage, it will be still
   more evident, that the encomiums here pronounced have all a special
   reference to the end of which I have spoken. Some interpreters
   judiciously explain the word heavens, of the angels, among whom there
   is a common joy and congratulation in the salvation of the Church. This
   interpretation is confirmed from the last clause of the verse, in which
   it is asserted, that God's truth will be celebrated in the congregation
   of the saints There is no doubt, that the same subject is here
   prosecuted, and that by the word truth, it is intended to signalise the
   remarkable deliverances by which God had manifested his faithfulness to
   the promises made to his servants.

   6 For who in the clouds can be compared to Jehovah? The prophet now
   proceeds to illustrate farther what he had said respecting God's
   wonders, and exclaims emphatically, Who in the clouds can be compared
   to God? The reason why he speaks of the clouds, or heaven, is because,
   what is not surprising, nothing is to be found upon the earth which can
   at all approach the glory of God. Although man excels other living
   creatures, yet we see how contemptible and miserable his condition is,
   or rather, how full it is of shame and reproach. Whence it follows,
   that under heaven there is no excellence which can compete with that of
   God. But when we ascend to heaven, immediately ravished with
   admiration, we conceive of a multitude of gods, which do away with the
   true God. The last clause of the verse, in which it is said, that among
   the sons of the gods there is none like the true and only God, is an
   explanation of the first. The opinion of some, that by the clouds, or
   the heavens, is to be understood the sun, moon, and stars, is disproved
   by the context itself. The amount then is, that even in the heavens,
   God alone has the entire pre-eminence, having there none as a companion
   or equal. The appellation the sons of the gods is here given to angels,
   because they neither have their origin from the earth, nor are clothed
   with a corruptible body, but are celestial spirits, adorned with a
   Divine glory. It is not meant that they are a part of the Divine
   essence or substance, as some fanatics dream; but as God displays his
   power in them, this title is attributed to them, to distinguish between
   their nature and ours. In short, although a greater majesty shines
   forth in the angels than in other creatures, at the contemplation of
   which we are ravished with admiration, yet come they not near God, so
   as to obscure and impair his glory by their excellence, or to share
   with him in the sovereignty of the universe. This is a point worthy of
   our careful attention; for, although God everywhere declares in his
   word that the angels are only his servants, and always ready to execute
   his commands, yet the world, not contented with having only one God,
   forges for itself a countless number of deities.

   To the same effect is the following verse, in which it is affirmed,
   that God is very terrible in the assembly of the saints. In these words
   is censured that devilish superstition, to which almost all men are
   prone, of exalting angels beyond measure, and without reason. But if
   the angels themselves tremble, and are afraid before the Divine
   Majesty, why should they not be regarded as subjects, and kept in their
   own rank, that God alone may have the sovereignty entirely to himself?
   Farther, when they are represented as around God, the meaning is, that
   they surround his royal throne like body-guards, and are always ready
   to execute his behests. In the subsequent verse the same thing is
   repeated yet again, Who is a strong God as thou art? and this is done,
   that at least the fear of the Divine Majesty may teach us to beware of
   robbing him of the honor which belongs to him. That we may not,
   however, by too much fear, be prevented from approaching him, some
   portion of sweetness is intermingled with this description, when it is
   declared, that his truth is to be seen round about him on all sides; by
   which we are to understand, that God is always steadfast in his
   promises, and that whatever changes may happen, he nevertheless
   continues invariably true, both before and behind, on the right hand
   and on the left. [528]

   [525] "Comp. 2 Samuel 7:11, etc. In 5:3 and 5:4, the Psalmist
   introduces God as speaking on a subject which he resumes in 5:34; so
   that the intervening verses may be considered as parenthetical." --
   Cresswell.

   [526] " -- and thy truth" -- Le Clerc thinks that the word men should
   here be supplied, and men thy truth; in which case, the congregation of
   the saints will have its proper meaning -- an assembly of the pious
   upon earth; and the Psalmist thus describes both angels and men as
   praising God." -- Cresswell.

   [527] "Literally who is he among the sons of Alim, (or of Gods, as in
   Psalm 29:1,) i.e., according to Suicer, the powerful, the princes of
   the earth. Ale, in the singular number, is used to signify God in
   Deuteronomy 32:17; Job 3:4, 23, (and in other places of that book;)
   Daniel 11:38; Habakkak 3:3. But it may be doubted whether its plural,
   Alim, ever means, as Aleim does, the true God. We have, however, the
   sons of Aleim, for chief men, in Genesis 6:2, and for angels in Job
   1:6; in which sense some commentators have understood the sons of Alim
   both here and in Psalm 29:1, and with them agrees the Chaldee
   interpreter of this place. In Habakkak 1:11, Ale is used in speaking of
   the false god of the Chaldeans; and Parkhurst is of opinion, that by
   the sons of Alim are meant those kings who worshipped material
   divinities, such as the sun." -- Cresswell.

   [528] Ainsworth reads, "God is daunting terrible." The original word is
   nrph, naarats, from rph, arats, he was broken, bruised, terrified. "An
   epithet of God," says Bythner "as though breaking all things."

   Psalm 89:9-14

   9. Thou governest the pride of the sea: when the waves thereof rise up,
   thou restrainest them 10. Thou hast overthrown Egypt, as a wounded man;
   [529] with thy mighty arm [literally, with the arm of thy strength]
   thou hast scattered thy enemies. 11. The heavens are thine, the earth
   also is thine: thou hast made the world, and the fullness thereof. 12.
   Thou hast created the north [530] and the south: [531] Tabor and Hermon
   [532] shall rejoice in thy name. 13. Thou hast a mighty arm: thou wilt
   strengthen thy hand, thou wilt exalt thy right hand. 14. Righteousness
   and judgment are the place of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go
   before thy face.


   9. Thou governest the pride of the sea. I have already observed that
   what the prophet has hitherto spoken generally concerning the power of
   God, is to be referred to the miracle of the deliverance of the
   Israelites from Egypt, which he now celebrates in express terms.
   According to the interpretation of some, God is said to still the
   impetuous waves of the sea, because he does not suffer it to break
   forth and overflow the whole world by a deluge. But I would read the
   9th and 10th verses connectedly, and would understand the prophet as
   speaking of the Red Sea, which God divided to make a way for the chosen
   tribes to pass over. The Psalmist adds immediately after, that all the
   land of Egypt was overthrown as a wounded man By these words he
   magnifies the grace of God, which was displayed in the deliverance of
   the Church. He intended, there can be no doubt, to set before his own
   mind and the minds of others, the paternal love of God, to encourage
   both himself and others to have recourse to Him for succor, with the
   greater freedom and alacrity. And in affirming that God had broken in
   pieces his enemies with his mighty arm, he concludes from the past
   experience of the Church, that his mode of acting will be always
   similar, whenever in his infinite wisdom he sees it to be required.

   11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine. He again repeats,
   the third time, that the same God who had been the deliverer of the
   chosen people exercises supreme dominion over the whole world. From the
   fact that God created all things, he concludes, that it is He who
   actually presides over, and controls whatever takes place in heaven and
   in earth. It would be absurd to suppose, that the heavens, having been
   once created by God, should now revolve by chance, and that things
   should be thrown into confusion upon the earth either at the will of
   men, or at random, when it is considered that it belongs to God to
   maintain and govern whatever he has created; unless, like the heathen,
   we would imagine that he enjoys himself in beholding all the works of
   his hand, in this beautiful theater of the heaven and the earth,
   without giving himself any farther trouble about them. In speaking of
   the south and the north, and also of the mountains, Tabor and Hermon,
   the prophet accommodates his language to the unrefined apprehension of
   the common people: as if he had said, there is no part of the fabric of
   the world which does not reverence and honor its Creator. I also
   connect with this the next verse, which affirms, that the arm of God is
   furnished with power, his hand with strength, and that his right hand
   is exalted Some resolve the two last clauses of the verse into the form
   of a prayer, Strengthen thy hand, lift up thy right hand; but this
   seems too much removed from the mind of the prophet, who, with the
   simple view of encouraging all the godly, celebrates the inconceivable
   power of God.

   14. Righteousness and judgement are the place of thy throne. These
   encomiums serve more effectually to confirm the hope of true believers
   than if the Divine power alone had been presented to our view. Whenever
   mention is made of God, it behoves us to apply our minds principally to
   those attributes of his nature which are specially fitted for
   establishing our faith, that we may not lose ourselves by vainly
   indulging in subtile speculations, by which foolish men, although they
   may minister to their own mental recreation, make no advances to the
   right understanding of what God really is. The prophet, therefore, in
   allusion to the insignia and pomp of kings, declares that righteousness
   and judgment are the pillars of the throne on which God sits
   conspicuous in sovereign state, and that mercy and truth are, as it
   were, his pursuivants; as if he had said, "The ornaments with which God
   is invested, instead of being a robe of purple, a diadem, or a scepter,
   are, that he is the righteous and impartial judge of the world, a
   merciful father, and a faithful protector of his people." Earthly
   kings, from their having nothing in themselves to procure for them
   authority, and to give them dignity, [533] are under the necessity of
   borrowing elsewhere what will invest them therewith; but God having in
   himself an all-sufficiency, and standing in no need of any other helps,
   exhibits to us the splendor of his own image in his righteousness,
   mercy, and truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [529] Hammond's explanation of the words, And thy truth is round about
   thee, conveys a striking and beautiful idea. "The elegance of the
   phrase (which is poetical) seems to be taken," says he, "from the style
   of angels, verse 7th, where they are described as they that encompass
   God; signifying, that as they wait upon God, and execute his will, so,
   far above the strength of those, God's fidelity, his care to perform
   his promise exactly encompasses him, is ready prest to perform all that
   he hath ever promised to do." -- Hammond.

   [530] Horsley renders the clause thus: -- Thou hast crushed Rahab, that
   she lies gasping with her wounds; and has the following note: -- "The
   word chll," [for lies gasping with her wounds,] "as it is used here,
   and in Psalm 88:5, signifies not a dead carcass, but a person left for
   dead, under his wounds, upon the field of battle; a person so wounded,
   as to be fallen, and incapable of rising to defend himself, or annoy
   the enemy. It answers exactly to the Greek word, traumatias, by which
   the LXX. render it. We have no corresponding word in the English
   language." Dr Adam Clarke reads, "Thou, like a hero, hast broken down
   Egypt;" and observes, "Dr Kennicott has largely proved, that chll,
   chalal, which we render wounded, slain, etc., means a soldier, warrior,
   hero; and it is certain that this sense agrees better with it than the
   other in a great number of places."

   [531] "The Hebrew word for the north,' is derived from a root
   signifying to hide, conceal.' The north' is probably so named; because
   in our northern hemisphere of the earth, the sun appears to move from
   east to south, and from south to west, and, towards mid-day, is at all
   times of the year southerly; whence the north side of a building, tree,
   or mountain, is usually concealed' or hidden' from his direct rays, and
   is, as we express it, in the shade. (See Parkhurst on tsphn, 4.)
   Simonis, also, assigns this as the reason of the name, in the judgment
   of some critics, or, in that of others, because the north is covered
   with snow, and of others again, with darkness; and so the Greek word
   for darkness, zophos, is continually used by Homer for the north: for
   the ancients thought that the north was always buried in gloom and
   thick darkness." -- Mant

   [532] The original word ymyn, yamin, for "the south," signifies
   literally "the right hand." As the Hebrews, when they engaged in
   prayer, turned their faces eastward, they called the East phnym, the
   face, and the West, 'chvr, the hinder part The South, therefore, would
   necessarily be on their right hand; and hence, ymym, yamin, came to be
   used to denote the south

   [533] Tabor is a mountain of Judea, and Hermon (Psalm 133:3) of Syria,
   the former to the west, and the latter to the east of the Jordan; so
   that they may be considered as put for the East and the West.
   Accordingly, the Chaldee paraphrase is, "Thou hast created the desert
   of the north, and the inhabitants of the south; Tabor on the west, and
   Hermon on the east, sing praises to thy name." "These mountains," says
   Warner, "were at a considerable distance from each other. This
   indicates, that the most distant parts of the land shall be equally
   blessed; have a like cause of rejoicing."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 89:15-18

   15. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound! [534] they shall
   walk, O Jehovah! in the brightness of thy countenance. 16. In thy name
   shall they daily rejoice; and in thy righteousness shall they glory.
   17. For thou art the glory of their strength; and in thy favor shall
   our horn be exalted. 18. For to Jehovah [535] is our buckler; and our
   King is to the Holy One of Israel.


   15. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound. Here the same
   train of reflection concerning the Church is pursued, not only because
   unbelievers are blind to the consideration of God's works, but also
   because the prophet has no other purpose in view than to inspire the
   godly with good hope, that they may with confidence rely upon God, and
   not be discouraged by any adversities from boldly calling upon him. It
   is declared that those are happy to whom it is given to rejoice in God;
   for although all men in common are sustained and nourished by his
   liberality, yet the feeling of his paternal goodness is far from being
   experienced by all men in such a manner as to enable them, from a
   certain persuasion that he is favorable to them, to congratulate
   themselves upon their happy condition. It is, therefore, a singular
   privilege which he confers upon his chosen ones, to make them taste of
   his goodness, that thereby they may be encouraged to be glad and
   rejoice. And, in fact, there is not a more miserable condition than
   that of unbelievers, when by their brutish insensibility they trample
   under foot the Divine benefits which they greedily devour; for the more
   abundantly God pampers them, the fouler is their ingratitude. True
   happiness then consists in our apprehending the Divine goodness which,
   filling our hearts with joy, may stir us up to praise and thanksgiving.

   The prophet afterwards proves from the effect, that those who with joy
   and delight acknowledge God to be their father are blessed, because
   they not only enjoy his benefits, but also, confiding in his favor,
   pass the whole course of their life in mental peace and tranquillity.
   This is the import of walking in the light of God's countenance: it is
   to repose upon his providence from the certain persuasion that he has a
   special care about our well-being, and keeps watch and ward effectually
   to secure it. The expressions rejoicing in his name, and glorying in
   his righteousness, are to the same purpose. The idea involved in them
   is, that believers find in God abundant, yea more than abundant, ground
   to rejoice and glory. The word daily appears to denote steadfast and
   unwavering perseverance; and thus there is indirectly censured the
   foolish arrogance of those who, inflated only with wind and presuming
   on their own strength, lift up their horns on high. Standing as they do
   upon an insecure foundation, they must at length inevitably fall.
   Whence it follows, that there is no true magnanimity nor any power
   which can stand but that which leans upon the grace of God alone; even
   as we see how Paul (Romans 8:31) nobly boasts, "If God be for us, who
   can be against us?" and defies all calamities both present and to come.

   17. For thou art the glory of their strength. The same sentiment is
   confirmed when it is declared, that God never leaves his faithful
   servants destitute of strength. By the appellation the glory of their
   strength, which is ascribed to him, is meant that they are always so
   sustained by his present aid as to have just ground to glory in him; or
   which amounts to the same thing, that his power appears always glorious
   in aiding and sustaining them. They are, however, at the same time,
   reminded of the duty of yielding to God all the praise of their being
   preserved in safety. If this is true as to the present life, it is much
   more truly applicable to the spiritual life of the soul. Farther, the
   more highly to magnify this instance of God's liberality, we are
   taught, at the same time, that it depends entirely upon his good
   pleasure, there being no other cause of it. [536] Whence it follows,
   that they are wholly bound and indebted to Him who is induced by his
   free bounty alone to continue to extend to them his help.

   18. For to Jehovah is our buckler. As the chief protection of the
   people was in the person of their king, it is here expressly shown,
   that the maintenance of the welfare of the faithful by his
   instrumentality is the gift of God. But it is to be noticed, that the
   prophet's mind was not so fixed upon this temporal and transitory
   kingdom as to neglect, at the same time, to consider the end of it, as
   we shall presently see. He knew that it was only on account of Christ
   that God made his favor to flow upon the head of the Church, and from
   thence upon the whole body. And, in the first place, while he calls the
   king metaphorically a buckler, -- a figurative expression frequently
   employed in Scripture, -- he confesses that when the people are
   defended by his hand and working, it is nevertheless done by the
   providence of God, and is thus to be traced to a higher source than
   human agency. The same thing is again repeated in the second clause, in
   which it is affirmed, that the king was given by God to govern the
   people; and that, therefore, the defense which comes from the king is a
   blessing of God. Moreover, we must remember that what is said of this
   kingdom, which was a shadow of something greater, properly applies to
   the person of Christ, whom the Father has given to us to be the
   guardian of our welfare, that we may be maintained and defended by his
   power.

   Psalm 89:19-23

   19. Then thou spakest in vision to thy meek ones, [537] and saidst, I
   have laid help upon a mighty one; I have exalted one chosen from among
   the people. 20. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil
   [literally with the oil of my holiness] have I anointed him. 21.
   Therefore, my hand shall be established with him: my arm also shall
   strengthen him. 22. The enemy shall not exact upon him, [538] nor shall
   the son of iniquity afflict him. 23. And I will break in pieces his
   oppressors before his face; and I will strike those who hate him.


   19. Then thou spakest in vision to thy meek ones. The Psalmist now
   declares at greater length why he said that the king, set over the
   chosen people for the preservation of the public good, was given them
   from heaven; namely, because he was not chosen by the suffrages of men,
   nor usurped at his own hand the supreme power, nor insinuated himself
   into it by corrupt arts, but was elected by God to be the instrument of
   maintaining the public good, and performed the duties of his office
   under the auspices and conduct of God. The design of the prophet, as we
   shall shortly see more clearly, is to distinguish this
   Divinely-appointed king from all other kings. Although what Paul
   teaches in Romans 13:1, is true, "There is no power but of God;" yet
   there was a great difference between David and all earthly kings who
   have acquired sovereign power by worldly means. God had delivered the
   scepter to his servant David immediately with his own hand, so to
   speak, and had seated him on the royal throne by his own authority. The
   particle 'z, az, which properly signifies then, is taken also for long
   since, or in old time. The meaning, therefore, is, that whereas some
   are born kings, succeeding their fathers by right of inheritance, and
   some are elevated to the royal dignity by election, while others
   acquire it for themselves by violence and force of arms, God was the
   founder of this kingdom, having chosen David to the throne by his own
   voice. Farther, although he revealed his purpose to Samuel, yet as the
   plural number is here used, implying, that the same oracle had been
   delivered to others, we may certainly conclude that it had been
   communicated to other prophets that they might be able, with one
   consent, to bear testimony that David was created king by the Divine
   appointment. And, indeed, as other distinguished and celebrated
   prophets lived at that time, it is not very probable that a matter of
   so great importance was concealed from them. But Samuel alone is named
   in this business, because he was the publisher of the Divine oracle and
   the minister of the royal anointing. As God in those days spake to his
   prophets either by dreams or by visions, this last mode of revelation
   is here mentioned.

   There next follows the substance or amount of the Divine oracle, That
   God had furnished with help the strong or mighty one whom he had chosen
   to be the supreme head and governor of the kingdom. David is called
   strong, not because naturally and in himself he excelled in strength,
   (for, as is well known, he was of small stature, and despised among his
   brethren, so that even Samuel passed him over with neglects) but
   because God, after having chosen him, endued him with new strength, and
   other distinguished qualities suitable for a king; even as in a
   parallel case, when Christ chose his apostles, he not only honored them
   with the title, but at the same time bestowed the gifts which were
   necessary for executing their office. And at the present day he imparts
   to his ministers the same grace of his Spirit. The strength of David,
   then, of which mention is here made, was the effect of his election;
   for God, in creating him king, furnished him at the same time with
   strength adequate for the preservation of the people. This appears
   still more distinctly from the second clause, where this invincible
   strength is traced to its source: I have exalted one chosen from among
   the people. All the words are emphatic. When God declares that he
   exalted him, it is to intimate the low and mean condition in which
   David lived, unknown and obscure, before God stretched out his hand to
   him. To the same effect is the expression which follows, from among the
   people. The meaning is, that he was at that time unnoted, and belonged
   to the lowest class of the people, and gave no indications of superior
   excellence, being the least esteemed of his father's children, in whose
   country cottage he held the humble office of a herdsman. [539] By the
   word chosen, God calls us back to the consideration of his own free
   will, as if he forbade us to seek for any other cause of David's
   exaltation than his own good pleasure.

   20 I have found David my servant. The prophet confirms the same
   proposition, That there was nothing of royalty in David, who owed all
   to the sovereignty of God in preventing him by his grace. Such is the
   import of the word found, as if God had said, When I took him to
   elevate him, this proceeded entirely from my free goodness. The name
   servant, therefore, does not denote any merit, but is to be referred to
   the divine call. It is as if God had said, that he confirmed and
   ratified by his authority the sovereign power of David; and if He
   approved it, its legitimacy is placed beyond all doubt. The second
   clause of the verse affords an additional confirmation of God's free
   election: With my holy oil have I anointed him. This anointing, which
   was not the fruit of David's own policy, but which he obtained contrary
   to all expectation, was the cause of his elevation to the estate of
   royalty. God then having of himself, and according to his mere good
   pleasure, anticipated David, that he might anoint him king by the hand
   of Samuel, he justly declares that he found him. It is afterwards
   added, that he will be the guardian and protector of this kingdom of
   which he was the founder; for it is not his usual way to abandon his
   works after having commenced them, but, on the contrary, to carry them
   forward by a continued process of improvement to their completion.

   22 The enemy shall not exact upon him. [540] Here it is declared in
   express terms, that although David may not be without enemies, the
   power of God will be always ready to maintain and defend him, that he
   may not be oppressed with unrighteous violence. It is accordingly
   affirmed, that David will not be tributary to his enemies, as he who is
   vanquished in battle is constrained to grant such conditions of peace
   as his conqueror may dictate, however injurious to himself these may
   be. When his enemies are called sons of iniquity, it is tacitly
   intimated, that this government will be so exempt from tyranny and
   extortion, that whoever shall attempt to overthrow it will be involved
   in the perpetration of wrong and wickedness. The amount is, that David
   and his successors will be so secure and strongly fortified by the
   divine protection, that it will be impossible for their enemies to
   treat them as they would wish. In regard to the fact, that God suffered
   this kingdom to be greatly afflicted, so that David's successors were
   constrained to pay a vast amount of tribute to foreign and heathen
   kings, it is not at variance with this promise; for, although the power
   of the kingdom was reduced, it was enough that the root still remained,
   until Christ came, in whose hand the kingdom was at length firmly
   established. As both the king and the people wickedly rejected this
   singular blessing of God, the kingdom was often shaken through their
   own default, afterwards impaired, and finally ruined. Yet God, to
   confirm his oracle concerning the perpetuity of this kingdom, ceased
   not all along to cherish and preserve some hope, by contending against
   their ingratitude. Besides, when mention is made of David's haters and
   oppressors, it is intimated, that this throne will not be privileged
   with exemption from annoyances and troubles, inasmuch as there will be
   always some who will rise up in hostility against it, unless God set
   himself in opposition to them.

   Psalm 89:24-29

   24. My truth and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his
   horn be exalted. 25. And I will set his hand in the sea, and his right
   hand in the rivers. [541] 26. He shall cry to me, Thou art my Father,
   my God, and the Rock of my salvation. 27. I will also make him my
   first-born, [542] higher than the kings of the earth. 28. And I will
   keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant shall stand fast with
   him. 29. And I will establish his seed for ever, and his throne as the
   days of heaven.


   24 My truth and my mercy shall be with him. God shows that he will
   continue to exercise without intermission that grace which he had
   manifested towards David at first. These words are as if he had said,
   that to prove himself faithful to his word, he would be always gracious
   and bountiful. Thus We see that God, not only at the outset, furnished
   David with testimonies of his goodness, but that he always continued to
   deal with him in the same merciful way. This has a reference to the
   whole Church of Christ, so that the divine goodness is manifested in
   the whole course of our salvation, and not only at our first entrance
   upon it, as these shufflers and sophists the Sorbonists foolishly talk.
   [543] The horn of David denotes here, as it often does in other places,
   his glory, dignity, and power. The meaning therefore is, that by the
   grace of God, this kingdom shall always flourish and prosper.

   25. And I will set his hand in the sea. The vast extent of the kingdom
   is here adverted to. As the people by their wickedness had, as it were,
   blocked up the way, and intercepted the blessing of God, their
   inheritance was more limited than the promise implied. But now God
   declares, that during the reign of David, it will be again enlarged, so
   that the people shall possess the whole country, from the sea even to
   the river Euphrates. From this we gather, that what God had promised by
   Moses was fulfilled only in the person of David, that is to say, from
   his time. [544] By the rivers may be understood, either the Euphrates
   alone, which is cut into many channels, or the other neighboring rivers
   on the coast of Syria.

   26. He shall cry to me, Thou art my Father. In this verse it is
   declared, that the chief excellence of this king will consist in this,
   that he will be accounted the Son of God. This indeed is a title of
   honor, which is applied to all whom God ordains to be kings, as we have
   seen in a previous psalm,

   "I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most
   High:"
   (Psalm 82:6)

   but in the passage before us, something special is expressed of the
   holy king whom God had chosen, and it is intended to say, that he will
   be the son of God in a different sense. We shall immediately see in the
   subsequent verse, how he is placed in a higher rank than the kings of
   the earth, although they may sway the scepter over a larger extent of
   country. It was therefore a privilege peculiar to only one king in this
   world, to be called the Son of God. Had it been otherwise, the apostle
   reasoned not only inconclusively but absurdly, in quoting this text as
   a proof of the doctrine, that Christ is superior to the angels:

   "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son,"
   (Hebrews 1:5.)

   Angels, and kings, and all who are regenerated by the Spirit of
   adoption, are called sons of God; but David, when God promises to take
   him for his son, is, by singular prerogative, elevated above all others
   to whom this designation is applied. This is still more apparent from
   the following verse, in which he is called God's first-born, because he
   is higher than all the kings of the earth; and this is an honor which
   transcends all the dignity both of men and angels. If it is objected,
   that David being a mortal man could not be equal to the angels, the
   obvious answer is, that if he is considered in himself, he cannot
   justly be elevated to the same rank with them, but with the highest
   propriety he may, in so far as for a time he represented the person of
   Christ.

   28. And I will keep my mercy to him for ever. We see how God frequently
   repeats, that he had set up the kingdom of David with the express
   design of establishing it for ever. By placing his mercy first in
   order, and then adding his covenant, he points out the cause of this
   covenant, intimating in one word, that it is gratuitous, and that his
   grace is not only the foundation on which it rests, but also the cause
   why it is preserved inviolate. The amount is, that God will be always
   merciful to David, in order that his covenant may never fail. From this
   it follows, that its inviolability depends upon the mere good pleasure
   of God. In the next verse, God expresses the effect of his truth,
   declaring, that the posterity of David will sit for ever on the royal
   throne. There being nothing under heaven of long continuance, the days
   of heaven is an expression employed to denote everlasting duration.
   Whence it follows, that this prophecy cannot have its full
   accomplishment in any till we come to Christ, in whom alone, in the
   strict and proper sense, this everlasting duration is to be found.

   Psalm 89:30-37

   30. If his children shall forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
   31. If they violate [545] my ordinances, and keep not my statutes; 32.
   Then will I visit their transgression with my rod, [546] and their
   iniquity with stripes. 33. But my loving-kindness will I not withdraw
   from him; nor suffer my faithfulness to fail, [literally, nor will I
   lie in my truth.] 34. My covenant will I not break, nor alter that
   which hath proceeded from my lips. 35. Once have I sworn by my
   holiness, That I will not lie [547] to David. 36. His seed shall endure
   for ever; and his throne as the sun before me. 37. It shall be
   established for ever as the moon, and a faithful witness in the heaven.
   [548] Selah.


   30. If his children shall forsake my law. The prophet proceeds yet
   farther, declaring, that although the posterity of David should fall
   into sin, yet God had promised to show himself merciful towards them,
   and that he would not punish their transgressions to the full extent of
   their desert. Moreover, to give the promise the greater efficacy, he
   always introduces God speaking, as if he presented to him a request
   corresponding with the precise words and express articles of his
   covenant. [549] It was very necessary that this should be added; for so
   easily do we slide into evil, and so prone are we to continual falls,
   that unless God, in the exercise of his infinite mercy, pardoned us,
   there would not be a single article of his covenant which would
   continue steadfast. God, therefore, seeing that it could not be
   otherwise, but that the posterity of David, in so far as it depended
   upon themselves, would frequently fall from the covenant, by their own
   fault, has provided a remedy for such cases, in his pardoning grace.

   Farther, as it is profitable for men to be subjected to divine
   correction, he does not promise that he will allow them to escape
   unpunished, which would be to encourage them in their sins; but he
   promises, that in his chastisements he will exercise a fatherly
   moderation, and will not execute vengeance upon them to the full extent
   which their sins deserve. It is also to be observed, that he promises
   pardon, not only for light offenses, but also for great and aggravated
   sins. It is not without cause that he uses these forms of expression,
   to forsake his law, to violate his statutes, not to walk in his
   judgments, and not to keep his commandments Nor is it without cause
   that he uses the word transgression, or perfidiousness, and iniquity.
   We see, then, that the patience and lenity of God, by which he
   reconciles to himself the posterity of David, is extended even to sins
   of the most heinous and aggravated description.

   This passage teaches us, that when God adopts men into his family, they
   do not forthwith completely lay aside the flesh with its corruptions,
   as is held by some enthusiasts, who dream, that as soon as we are
   grafted into the body of Christ, all the corruption that is in us must
   be destroyed. Would to God that we could all on a sudden change our
   nature, and thus exhibit that angelic perfection which they require!
   But as it is quite apparent, that we are far from such an attainment,
   so long as we carry about with us this tabernacle of flesh, let us bid
   adieu to that devilish figment, and let us all betake ourselves to the
   sanctuary of forgiveness, which is at all times open for us. God,
   unquestionably, is speaking of the household of his Church; and yet it
   is declared, with sufficient plainness, in the promise which he makes
   of pardoning their offenses, that they will transgress and be guilty of
   revolting from him.

   To limit what is here said to the ancient people of Israel, is an
   exposition not only absurd, but altogether impious. In the first place,
   I take it as a settled point, which we have already had occasion often
   to consider, that this kingdom was erected to be a figure or shadow in
   which God might represent the Mediator to his Church: and this can be
   proved, not only from the testimony of Christ and the apostles, but it
   may also be clearly and indubitably deduced from the thing considered
   in itself. If we set Christ aside, where will we find that everlasting
   duration of the royal throne of which mention is here made? The second
   from David, in the order of succession, was despoiled of the greater
   part of the kingdom, so that out of twelve tribes he retained scarcely
   one tribe and a half. Afterwards, how many losses did this kingdom thus
   greatly reduced sustain, and by how many calamities was it defaced,
   until at length the king and the whole body of the people were dragged
   into captivity, with the utmost ignominy and reproach? And I pray you
   to consider where was the dignity of the throne, when the king, after
   his sons were put to death before his eyes, was himself treated as a
   criminal? (2 Kings 25:7.) The Jews were indeed afterwards permitted to
   dwell in their own country; but it was without the honor and title of a
   kingdom. Accordingly, Ezekiel (Ezekiel 21:27) declares thrice, that the
   crown shall be laid in the dust, "until he come whose right it is." The
   obvious conclusion then is, that perpetuity, as applied to this
   kingdom, can be verified in Christ alone. And, in fact, what access
   could the Jews of old time have had to God, or what access could we in
   the present day have to him, did not the Mediator come between us and
   him, to cause us find favor in his sight?

   It now remains that we apply to ourselves the qualities of this kingdom
   of which we have been speaking. As its everlasting duration leads us to
   the hope of a blessed immortality, and its invincible strength inspires
   our minds with tranquillity, and prevents our faith from failing,
   notwithstanding all the efforts which Satan may put forth against us,
   and notwithstanding the numerous forms of death which may surround us;
   so the pardon which is here promised belongs to the spiritual kingdom
   of Christ: and it may be equally gathered from this passage, that the
   salvation of the Church depends solely upon the grace of God, and the
   truth of his promises. If it is objected, that those who are
   regenerated by the Spirit of God never totally fall away, because the
   incorruptible seed of the word abides in them, I grant that this is an
   important truth. It is not, however, a total apostasy which is here
   spoken of -- not such as implies the entire extinction of godliness in
   the individual chargeable with it. But it sometimes happens that the
   faithful cast off the yoke of God, and break forth into sin in such a
   manner, as that the fear of God seems to be extinguished in them; and
   such being the case, it was necessary that He should promise the pardon
   even of heinous sins, that they might not upon every fall be
   overwhelmed with despair. Thus David seemed, to outward appearance, to
   be wholly deprived of the Spirit of God, whom he prays to be restored
   to him. The reason why God leaves hope of pardon even for detestable
   and deadly transgressions is, that the enormity of our sins may not
   keep us back or hinder us from seeking reconciliation with him. From
   this, we are led to condemn the undue severity of the fathers, who
   scrupled to receive to repentance those who had fallen for the second
   or third time. Due care must indeed be taken lest, by too great
   forbearance, loose reins should be given to men to commit iniquity; but
   there is no less danger in an extreme degree of rigour. It is to be
   observed, that when God declares that he will show himself merciful
   towards sinners, who have violated his law, and broken his
   commandments, he purposely employs these odious terms to excite our
   hatred and detestation of sin, and not to entice us to the commission
   of it. Still, however, we must understand the passage as amounting to
   this, That although the faithful may not in every instance act in a
   manner worthy of the grace of God, and may therefore deserve to be
   rejected by him, yet he will be merciful to them, because remission of
   sins is an essential article promised in his covenant. And, indeed, as
   God in his law requires us to perform what exceeds our power, all that
   he promises in it is of no avail to us, to whom it can never be
   accomplished. Hence Paul, in Romans 4:14, affirms, "If the inheritance
   come by the law, faith is made void, and the promise made of none
   effect." To this also belong these words of Jeremiah,

   "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant
   with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to
   the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took
   them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; (which my
   covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the
   Lord;) but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
   of Israel: After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their
   inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and
   they shall be my people. I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
   remember their sin no more." (Jeremiah 31:31-34)

   Farther, since God does not adopt us as his children, to encourage us
   to take liberty to commit sin with the greater boldness, mention is
   here made at the same time of chastisement, by which he shows that he
   hates the sins of his children, and, warning them of what they have
   deserved in offending him, invites and exhorts them to repentance. This
   fatherly chastisement then, which operates as medicine, holds the
   medium between undue indulgence, which is an encouragement to sin, and
   extreme severity, which precipitates persons into destruction. Here the
   inspired writer adverts to the prophecy recorded in 2 Samuel 7:14,
   where God declares that in chastising his own people, he will proceed
   after the manner of men --

   "If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and
   with the stripes of the children of men." (2 Samuel 7:14)

   God there speaks of his chastising his people after the manner of men,
   either because the anger of a father in correcting his children
   proceeds from love, -- for he sees that otherwise he would fail in
   promoting their good; or it contains a contrast between God and men,
   implying, that in the task of chastising he will proceed with
   moderation and gentleness; for, were he to put forth his strength, he
   would immediately bring us to nothing, yea, he could do this simply by
   moving one of his fingers. The scope of both passages undoubtedly is,
   that whenever God punishes the sins of true believers, he will observe
   a wholesome moderation; and it is therefore our duty to take all the
   punishments which he inflicts upon us, as so many medicines. On this
   point, the Papists have egregiously blundered. Not understanding the
   true end and fruit of chastisements, they have imagined that God
   proceeds herein as if avenging himself upon sinners. Whence arose their
   satisfactions, and from these again proceeded pardons and indulgences,
   by which they endeavored to redeem themselves from the hand and
   vengeance of God. [550] But God has nothing else in view than to
   correct the vices of his children, in order that, after having
   thoroughly purged them, he may restore them anew to his favor and
   friendship; according to the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:33,
   which affirm that the faithful "are chastened of the Lord, that they
   should not be condemned with the world." For this reason, lest they
   should be overwhelmed with the weight of chastisement, he restrains his
   hand, and makes considerate allowance for their infirmity. Thus the
   promise is fulfilled, That he does not withdraw his loving-kindness
   from his people, even when he is angry with them; for, while he is
   correcting them for their profit and salvation, he does not cease to
   love them. It is, however, to be observed, that there is a change of
   person in the words. After it is said, If his children shall forsake my
   law, etc., it is at length subjoined, My loving-kindness or mercy will
   I not withdraw from Him. It ought surely to have been said, them
   instead of him, since it is children in the plural number who are
   before spoken of. But it is very probable that this form of expression
   is purposely employed to teach us that we are reconciled to God only
   through Christ; and that if we would expect to find mercy, we must seek
   for it from that source alone. What follows in the end of the verse, I
   will not suffer my faithfulness to fail, is more emphatic than if it
   had been said that God will be true to what he has said. It is possible
   that God's promise may fail of taking effect, and yet he may continue
   faithful. For example, the law is true and holy, and yet of what
   advantage is it to us that salvation is promised in the law, when no
   human being can ever obtain salvation by it? God then in this passage
   leads us farther; promising that his covenant shall be steadfast and
   effectual, not only because he will be faithful on his part, but also
   because he will keep his people from falling away through their own
   inconstancy.

   34 My covenant will I not break. As the true knowledge of God's mercy
   can only be obtained from his word, he enjoins us to keep our eyes
   intently fixed upon his covenant. The more excellent and invaluable a
   blessing it is, "Never to be rejected after having been once adopted by
   him," the more difficult it is for us to believe its truth. And we know
   how many thoughts from time to time present themselves to our minds,
   tempting us to call it in question. That the faithful, therefore, may
   not harass themselves beyond measure in debating in their own minds
   whether or no they are in favor with God, they are enjoined to look to
   the covenant, and to embrace the salvation which is offered to them in
   it. God here commends to us his own faithfulness, that we may account
   his promise sufficient, and that we may not seek the certainty of our
   salvation any where else. He had said above, If the children of David
   break my statutes; and now, alluding to that breach, he declares that
   he will not requite them as they requite him, My covenant will I not
   break, implying, that although his people may not altogether act in a
   manner corresponding to their vocation, as they ought to do, he will
   not suffer his covenant to be broken and disannulled on account of
   their fault, because he will promptly and effectually prevent this in
   the way of blotting out their sins by a gratuitous pardon. He is still
   pursuing the illustration of the preceding proposition, I will not
   suffer my faithfulness to fail; promising not only to be faithful on
   his side, as we say, but also that what he has promised shall take full
   effect, in despite of all the impediments which men may cast in the
   way; for he will strive against their sins, that by means of them the
   fruit of his goodness may not be prevented from reaching them. When the
   Jews, by their ingratitude and treachery, revolted from him, the
   covenant was not disannulled, because it was founded upon the perfect
   immutability of his nature. And still, at the present day, when our
   sins mount even to the heavens, the goodness of God fails not to rise
   above them, since it is far above the heavens.

   35. Once have I sworn by my holiness. God now confirms by an oath what
   he previously stated he had promised to David; from which it appears
   that it was not a matter of small importance; it being certain that God
   would not interpose his holy name in reference to what was of no
   consequence. It is a token of singular loving-kindness for him, upon
   seeing us prone to distrust, to provide a remedy for it so
   compassionately. We have, therefore, so much the less excuse if we do
   not embrace, with true and unwavering faith, his promise which is so
   strongly ratified, since in his deep interest about our salvation, he
   does not withhold his oath, that we may yield entire credence to his
   word. If we do not reckon his simple promise sufficient, he adds his
   oath, as it were, for a pledge. The adverb once, [551] denotes that the
   oath is irrevocable, and that therefore we have not the least reason to
   be apprehensive of any inconstancy. He affirms that he sware by his
   holiness, because a greater than himself is not to be found, by whom he
   could swear. In swearing by Him, we constitute him our judge, and place
   him as sovereign over us, even as he is our sovereign by nature. It is
   a more emphatic manner of expression for him to say, by my holiness,
   than if he had said, by myself, not only because it magnifies and
   exalts his glory, but also because it is far more fitted for the
   confirmation of faith, calling back, as it does, the faithful to the
   earthly habitation which he had chosen for himself, that they might not
   think it necessary for them to seek him at a distance; for by the term
   holiness, I have no doubt, he means the sanctuary. And yet he swears by
   himself, and by nothing else; for, in naming the temple which he had
   appointed as his seat, he does not depart from himself; but, merely
   accommodating his language to our rude understandings, swears by his
   holiness which dwells visibly upon earth. With respect to the
   elliptical form of the oath, we have seen, in a previous psalm, that
   this was a manner of swearing quite common among the Hebrews. Thus they
   were warned that the name of God was not to be used without due
   consideration, lest, by using it rashly and irreverently, they should
   draw down upon themselves the Divine vengeance. The abrupt and
   suspended form of expression was, as it were, a bridle to restrain
   them, and give them opportunity for reflection. It is no uncommon thing
   for God to borrow something from the common custom of men.

   36. His seed shall endure for ever. There now follows the promise that
   the right of sovereignty shall always remain with the posterity of
   David. These two things -- his offspring and his throne, are conjoined;
   and by these words the everlasting duration of the kingdom is promised,
   so that it should never pass to those who were of a strange and
   different race. The sun and the moon are produced as witnesses; for
   although they are creatures subject to corruption, they yet possess
   more stability than the earth or air; the elements, as we see, being
   subject to continual changes. As the whole of this lower world is
   subject to unceasing agitation and change, there is presented to us a
   more steadfast state of things in the sun and moon, that the kingdom of
   David might not be estimated according to the common order of nature.
   Since, however, this royal throne was shaken in the time of Rehoboam,
   as we have before had occasion to remark, and afterwards broken down
   and overthrown, it follows that this prophecy cannot be limited to
   David. For although at length the outward majesty of this kingdom was
   put an end to without hope of being re-established, the sun ceased not
   to shine by day, nor the moon by night. Accordingly, until we come to
   Christ, God might seem to be unfaithful to his promises. But in the
   branch which sprung from the root of Jesse, these words were fulfilled
   in their fullest sense. [552]

   Psalm 89:38-45

   38. But thou hast abhorred and rejected him; thou hast been angry
   against thy anointed. 39. Thou hast made the covenant of thy servant to
   cease; [553] thou hast profaned his crown to the earth. 40. Thou hast
   broken down all his walls; thou hast made his fortresses a ruin. 41.
   All who pass by the way have spoiled him: he has been a reproach to his
   neighbors. 42. Thou hast exalted the right hand of his oppressors; thou
   hast caused all his enemies to rejoice. 43. Thou hast also blunted the
   edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in battle. 44. Thou
   hast effaced his splendor, and cast his throne to the ground. 45. Thou
   hast shortened the days of his youth; thou hast covered him with shame.
   Selah.


   38. But thou hast abhorred and rejected him. Here the prophet complains
   that in consequence of the decayed state of the kingdom, the prophecy
   appeared to have failed of its accomplishment. Not that he accuses God
   of falsehood; but he speaks in this manner, that he may with all
   freedom cast his cares and griefs into the bosom of God, who permits us
   to deal thus familiarly with him. It doubtless becomes us to frame our
   desires according to the divine will; but that person cannot be said to
   pass beyond due bounds who humbly laments that he is deprived of the
   tokens of the divine favor, provided be does not despair, or
   rebelliously murmur against God; and we shall afterwards see that the
   prophet, when he blesses God at the close of the psalm, affords a proof
   of tranquil submission, by which he corrects or qualifies his
   complaints. Whoever, therefore, that Rabbin was who maintained that it
   is unlawful to recite this psalm, he was led by a foolish and impious
   peevishness to condemn what God bears with in his children. In taking
   this liberty of expostulating with God, the prophet had no other object
   in view than that he might the more effectually resist distrust and
   impatience, by unburdening himself in the divine presence. Farther, the
   words, Thou hast abhorred and rejected him, if criticised according to
   the rules of the Greek and Latin language, will be pronounced
   inelegant; for the word which is most emphatic is put first, and then
   there is added another which is less emphatic. But as the Hebrews do
   not observe our manner of arrangement in this respect, the order here
   adopted is quite consistent with the idiom of the Hebrew language. The
   third verb contains the reason of this change on the part of God,
   teaching us that the king was rejected because God was incensed against
   him. It is thought by some that there is here a recital of the mockery
   in which the enemies of the chosen people indulged, an opinion which
   they adopt to avoid the difficulty arising from viewing this severe
   kind of complaint, as uttered by the Church, which proved such a
   stumbling-block to the Rabbin above referred to, that on account of it
   he condemned the whole psalm. But it is to be observed, that the
   prophet speaks according to the common feeling and apprehension of men;
   while at the same time he was fully convinced in his own mind, that the
   king who had been once chosen by God could not be rejected by him.

   In the same sense we ought to understand what follows (verse 39)
   concerning the disannulling of the covenant -- Thou hast made the
   covenant of thy servant to cease. The prophet does not charge God with
   levity and inconstancy: he only complains that those notable promises
   of which he had spoken had to appearance vanished and come to nought.
   Whenever the faithful put the question,

   "How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord?" "Awake, why sleepest thou, O
   Lord?"
   (Psalm 13:1; 44:23; 79:5,)

   they assuredly are not to be understood as attributing forgetfulness or
   sleep to him: they only lay before him the temptations which flesh and
   blood suggest to them in order to induce him speedily to succor them
   under the infirmity with which they are distressed. It is not then
   wonderful, though the prophet, amidst such horrible desolation, was
   affected by the infirmities to which human nature is so liable in such
   circumstances, and thus prompted to make the assertion, that what God
   promised was far from being manifestly realised. When he saw all things
   going contrary to the Divine promise, he was not a man so steel-hearted
   as to remain unmoved at so pitiable and confused a spectacle. But
   coming freely into the Divine presence, he seeks a remedy that he might
   not be swallowed up with sorrow, which would have been the case had he
   indulged in secret repining, and neglected this means of alleviation.
   What is added in the close of the verse, Thou hast cast his crown to
   the earth, does not seem to apply to the time of Rehoboam, unless,
   perhaps, the dismemberment of the kingdom may be denoted by the casting
   of the crown to the earth. The statements which are made immediately
   after must necessarily be referred to some greater calamity. If this is
   admitted, the author of the psalm must have been a different person
   from Ethan, who was one of the four wise men, of whom mention is made
   in the sacred history, (2 Kings 4:31.) In so doubtful a case, I leave
   every one to adopt the conjecture which appears to him the most
   probable.

   40. Thou hast broken down all his walls. The prophet, although he might
   easily have found another cause to which to impute the breaking down
   and razing of the fortifications, yet under the influence of devout and
   sanctified feeling acknowledges God to be the author of this calamity;
   being fully convinced that men could not at their pleasure have
   destroyed the kingdom which God had set up had not the Divine anger
   been kindled. Afterwards speaking metaphorically, he complains that the
   kingdom was exposed as a prey to all passers-by, resembling a field or
   garden, of which the walls were broken down, and the ground laid open
   to depredation. As an aggravation of a calamity which in itself was
   sufficiently grievous, the additional indignity is brought forward,
   that the king was a reproach to his neighbors. The worldly and the
   profane, there can be no doubt, finding an opportunity so much
   according to their wishes, derided him, saying, Is this that king of
   God's choice, a king more excellent than the angels, and whose throne
   was to continue as long as the sun and the moon should endure? As these
   railings recoiled upon God himself, the prophet justly complains of the
   reproachful derision with which God's Anointed was treated, whose
   dignity and royal estate were ratified and confirmed by heavenly
   anointing.

   42 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his oppressors. Here he states
   that God took part with the enemies of the king; for he was well aware
   that these enemies could not have prevailed but by the will of God, who
   inspires some with courage, and renders others faint-hearted. In short,
   in proportion to the number of the calamities which had befallen the
   chosen people, was the number of the evidences of their having been
   forsaken by God; for, so long as he continued his favor, the whole
   world, by all their machinations, were unable to impair the stability
   of that kingdom. Had it been said that the enemies of the king obtained
   the victory, the statement would have been quite true; but it would not
   have been a mode of expression so obviously fitted to exalt the Divine
   power; as it might have been thought that men setting themselves in
   opposition to God had, by their own power, forced their way, and
   effected their purpose, even against those who enjoyed his protection.
   Accordingly, the prophet reflects with himself, that unless the Divine
   anger had been incensed, that kingdom which God had erected could not
   have been reduced to a condition so extremely wretched.

   45. Thou hast shortened the days of his youth. Some would explain this
   sentence as meaning, that God had weakened the king, so that he faded
   or withered away at his very entrance upon the flower of youth, and was
   exhausted with old age before reaching the period of manhood. [554]
   This exposition may be regarded as not improbable; but still it is to
   be observed, in order to our having a clearer understanding of the mind
   of the prophet, that he does not speak exclusively of any one
   individual, but compares the state of the kingdom to the life of man.
   His complaint then amounts to this, That God caused the kingdom to wax
   old, and finally to decay, before it reached a state of complete
   maturity; its fate resembling that of a young man, who, while yet
   increasing in strength and vigor, is carried away by a violent death
   before his time. This similitude is highly appropriate; for the
   kingdom, if we compare the state of it at that period with the Divine
   promise, had scarce yet fully unfolded its blossom, when, amidst its
   first advances, suddenly smitten with a grievous decay, its freshness
   and beauty were defaced, while at length it vanished away. Moreover,
   what we have previously stated must be borne in mind, that when the
   prophet complains that the issue does not correspond with the promise,
   or is not such as the promise led the chosen people to expect, he does
   not, on that account, charge God with falsehood, but brings forward
   this apparent discrepancy for another purpose -- to encourage himself,
   from the consideration of the Divine promises, to come to the throne of
   grace with the greater confidence and boldness; and, while he urged
   this difficulty before God, he was fully persuaded that it was
   impossible for Him not to show himself faithful to his word. As the
   majority of men drink up their sorrow and keep it to themselves,
   because they despair of deriving any benefit from prayer so true
   believers, the more frankly and familiarly they appeal to God in
   reference to his promises, the more valiantly do they wrestle against
   their distrust, and encourage themselves in the hope of a favorable
   issue.

   [553] "There is a very obvious and important observation to be made on
   the description of the apparent change that had taken place in the
   conduct of God towards the family and descendants of David. The
   extraordinary promises which had been given to that prince were
   certainly not accomplished in the fortunes of his descendants, the
   kings of Judah; nor shall we be able to discover how the truth of these
   promises is to be sustained without an admission of their being given
   in reference to the Messiah, that spiritual king, who was born of the
   seed of David, according to the flesh.' When we take the assurances
   which were made to David, and which pledged to him the perpetuity of
   his kingdom, in this sense, the mystery is disclosed, and the
   difficulty is completely removed: the loving-kindness of God has not
   been withdrawn from him, nor has his faithfulness failed.' David has
   still a royal successor, though the genealogy of his posterity is lost
   upon earth; a successor who will endure for ever, and whose throne will
   be perpetuated in glory, not merely as long as the sun and the moon
   continue, but will still be rising in splendor, when those lights of
   heaven shall be extinguished, and the new heaven and the new earth
   shall witness the imperishable glories of the Son of God." -- Walford.

   Psalm 89:46-48

   46. How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
   fury burn like fire? 47. Remember of what age I am! [555] why shouldst
   thou have created all the sons of men in vain? [556] 48. What man shall
   live, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul [or life] from
   the hand of the grave? [557] Selah.


   46. How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? After having
   poured forth his complaints respecting the sad and calamitous condition
   of the Church, the Psalmist now turns himself to prayer. Whence it
   follows that the language of lamentation to which he had hitherto given
   utterance, although it emanated from carnal sense, was nevertheless
   conjoined with faith. Unbelievers, in the agitation of trouble, may
   sometimes engage in prayer, yet whatever they ask proceeds from feigned
   lips. But the prophet, by connecting prayer with his complaints, bears
   testimony that he had never lost his confidence in the truth of the
   Divine promises. With respect to this manner of expression, How long,
   for ever? we have spoken on Psalm 79:5, where we have shown that it
   denotes a long and continued succession of calamities. Moreover, by
   asking How long God will hide himself, he tacitly intimates that all
   will be well as soon as God is pleased to look upon his chosen people
   with a benignant countenance. In the second clause of the verse, he
   again mentions as the reason why God did not vouchsafe to look upon
   them with paternal favor, that his anger was incensed against them. The
   obvious conclusion from which is, that all the afflictions endured by
   us proceed from our sins; these being the scourges of an offended God.

   47 Remember how short my time is. After having confessed that the
   severe and deplorable afflictions which had befallen the Church were to
   be traced to her own sins as the procuring cause, the prophet, the more
   effectually to move God to commiseration, lays before him the brevity
   of human life, in which, if we receive no taste of the Divine goodness,
   it will seem that we have been created in vain. That we may understand
   the passage the more clearly, it will be better to begin with the
   consideration of the last member of the verse, Why shouldst thou have
   created all the sons of men in vain? The faithful, in putting this
   question, proceed upon an established first principle, That God has
   created men and placed them in the world, to show himself a father to
   them. And, indeed, as his goodness extends itself even to the cattle
   and lower animals of every kind, [558] it cannot for a moment be
   supposed, that we, who hold a higher rank in the scale of being than
   the brute creation, should be wholly deprived of it. Upon the contrary
   supposition, it were better for us that we had never been born, than to
   languish away in continual sorrow. There is, moreover, set forth the
   brevity of the course of our life; which is so brief, that unless God
   make timely haste in giving us some taste of his benefits, the
   opportunity for doing this will be lost, since our life passes rapidly
   away. The drift of this verse is now very obvious. In the first place,
   it is laid down as a principle, That the end for which men were created
   was, that they should enjoy God's bounty in the present world; and from
   this it is concluded that they are born in vain, unless he show himself
   a father towards them. In the second place, as the course of this life
   is short, it is argued that if God does not make haste to bless them,
   the opportunity will no longer be afforded when their life shall have
   run out.

   But here it may be said, in the first place, that the saints take too
   much upon them in prescribing to God a time in which to work; and, in
   the next place, that although he afflict us with continual distresses,
   so long as we are in our state of earthly pilgrimage, yet there is no
   ground to conclude from this that we have been created in vain, since
   there is reserved for us a better life in heaven, to the hope of which
   we have been adopted; and that, therefore, it is not surprising though
   now our life is hidden from us on earth. I answer, That it is by the
   permission of God that the saints take this liberty of urging him in
   their prayers to make haste; and that there is no impropriety in doing
   so, provided they, at the same time, keep themselves within the bounds
   of modesty, and, restraining the impetuosity of their affections, yield
   themselves wholly to his will. With respect to the second point, I
   grant that it is quite true, that although we must continue to drag out
   our life amidst continual distresses, we have abundant consolation to
   aid us in bearing all our afflictions, provided we lift up our minds to
   heaven. But still it is to be observed, in the first place, that it is
   certain, considering our great weakness, that no man will ever do this
   unless he has first tasted of the Divine goodness in this life; and,
   secondly, that the complaints of the people of God ought not to be
   judged of according to a perfect rule, because they proceed not from a
   settled and an undisturbed state of mind, but have always some excess
   arising from the impetuosity or vehemence of the affections at work in
   their minds. I at once allow that the man who measures the love of God
   from the state of things as presently existing, judges by a standard
   which must lead to a false conclusion;

   "for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth," (Hebrews 12:6.)

   But as God is never so severe towards his own people as not to furnish
   them with actual experimental evidence of his grace, it stands always
   true that life is profitless to men, if they do not feel, while they
   live, that He is their father.

   As to the second clause of the verse, it has been stated elsewhere that
   our prayers do not flow in one uniform course, but sometimes betray an
   excess of sorrow. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that the
   faithful, when immoderate sorrow or fear occupies their thoughts and
   keeps fast hold of them, experience such inattention stealing by
   degrees upon them, as to make them for a time forget to keep their
   minds fixed in meditation upon the life to come. Many think it very
   unaccountable, if the children of God do not, the first moment they
   begin to think, immediately penetrate into heaven, as if thick mists
   did not often intervene to impede or hinder us when we would look
   attentively into it. For faith to lose its liveliness is one thing, and
   for it to be utterly extinguished is another. And, doubtless, whoever
   is exercised in the judgments of God, and in conflict with temptations,
   will acknowledge that he is not so mindful of the spiritual life as he
   ought to be. Although then the question, Why shouldst thou have created
   all the sons of men in vain? is deduced from a true principle, yet it
   savours somewhat of a faulty excess. Whence it appears that even in our
   best framed prayers, we have always need of pardon. There always
   escapes from us some language or sentiment chargeable with excess, and
   therefore it is necessary for God to overlook or bear with our
   infirmity.

   48. What man shall live, and shall not see death? This verse contains a
   confirmation of what has been already stated concerning the brevity of
   human life. The amount is, that unless God speedily hasten to show
   himself a father to men, the opportunity of causing them to experience
   his grace will no longer exist. The original word gvr, geber, which we
   have translated man, is derived from the verb gvr, gabar, he was
   strong, or he prevailed; and the sacred writer employs this word, the
   more forcibly to express the truth, that no man is privileged with
   exemption from the dominion of death.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [555] Some of the Jewish interpreters take this view, and suppose the
   allusion to be to king Jehoiachin, (2 Kings 24:8.) Kennicott infers
   from the expression, "Thou hast shortened the days of his youth," that
   this portion of the psalm refers to Ahaz, who died at thirty-six years
   of age.

   [556] "Remember at what an age or time of life I am.' Or, of what
   duration,' or, how fleeting,' chlr, (by a transposition of letters from
   chrl, he ceased,) denotes the present time rapidly passing away. Or,
   the short race of our life; or this world, the fashion of which passeth
   away,' (1 Corinthians 7:31.)" -- Bythner

   [557] Ainsworth reads, "O call thou to remembrance how transitory I am;
   into what vain state thou hast made all the sons of Adam."

   [558] This appeal respecting the universality of death, and the
   impossibility of avoiding it, meets with a ready response in the bosom
   of every child of Adam, however exalted or humble his lot. And, when
   death has once seized on its victim, all the wealth, power, and skill
   of the world cannot spoil the grave of its dominion. The admirable
   lines of Gray, in his celebrated Elegy, furnish a very good comment on
   this verse: -- "The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
   And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
   Await alike th' inevitable hour: --
   The paths of glory lead but to the grave. "Can storied urn, or animated
   bust,
   Back to its mansions call the fleeting breath?
   Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
   Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 89:49-52

   49. O Lord! where are thy former mercies? thou hast sworn to David in
   thy truth. 50. O Lord! Remember the reproach of thy servants: I have
   sustained in my bosom all the reproaches of mighty peoples; 51. With
   which thy enemies, O Jehovah! have reproached thee; with which they
   have reproached the footsteps of thy Messiah, [or thy Anointed.] 52.
   Blessed be Jehovah for ever! Amen, and Amen.


   49. O Lord! where are thy former mercies? The prophet encourages
   himself, by calling to remembrance God's former benefits, as if his
   reasoning were, That God can never be unlike himself, and that
   therefore the goodness which he manifested in old time to the fathers
   cannot come to an end. This comparison might indeed make the godly
   despond, when they find that they are not dealt with by him so gently
   as he dealt with the fathers, did not another consideration at the same
   time present itself to their minds -- the consideration that he never
   changes, and never wearies in the course of his beneficence. As to the
   second clause of the verse, some interpreters connect it with the
   first, by interposing the relative, thus: -- Where are thy former
   mercies which thou hast sworn? In this I readily acquiesce; for the
   sense is almost the same, although the relative be omitted. God had
   given evident and indubitable proofs of the truth of the oracle
   delivered to Samuel; [559] and, therefore, the faithful lay before him
   both his promise and the many happy fruits of it which had been
   experienced. They say, in truth, that they may with the greater
   confidence apply to themselves, whatever tokens of his liberality God
   had in old time bestowed upon the fathers; for they had the same ground
   to expect the exercise of the Divine goodness towards them as the
   fathers had, God, who is unchangeably the same, having sworn to be
   merciful to the posterity of David throughout all ages.

   50. O Lord! remember the reproach of thy servants. They again allege,
   that they are held in derision by the ungodly, -- a consideration which
   had no small influence in moving God to compassion: for the more
   grievous and troublesome a temptation it is, to have the wicked
   deriding our patience, that, after having made us believe that God is
   not true in what he has promised, they may precipitate us into despair;
   the more ready is he to aid us, that our feeble minds may not yield to
   the temptation. The prophet does not simply mean that the reproaches of
   his enemies are to him intolerable, but that God must repress their
   insolence in deriding the faith and patience of the godly, in order
   that those who trust in him may not be put to shame. He enhances still
   more the same sentiment in the second clause, telling us, that he was
   assailed with all kind of reproaches by many peoples, or by the great
   peoples, for the Hebrew word rvym, rabbim, signifies both great and
   many

   Moreover, it is not without cause, that, after having spoken in general
   of the servants of God, he changes the plural into the singular number.
   He does this, that each of the faithful in particular may be the more
   earnestly stirred up to the duty of prayer. The expression, in my
   bosom, is very emphatic. It is as if he had said, The wicked do not
   throw from a distance their insulting words, but they vomit them, so to
   speak, upon the children of God, who are thus constrained to receive
   them into their bosom, and to bear patiently this base treatment. Such
   is the perversity of the time in which we live, that we have need to
   apply the same doctrine to ourselves; for the earth is full of profane
   and proud despisers of God, who cease not to make themselves merry at
   our expense. And as Satan is a master well qualified to teach them this
   kind of rhetoric, the calamities of the Church always furnish them with
   matter for exercising it. Some take bosom for the secret affection of
   the heart; but this exposition seems to be too refined.

   51. With which thy enemies, O Jehovah! have reproached thee. What the
   Psalmist now affirms is, not that the wicked torment the saints with
   their contumelious language, but that they revile even God himself. And
   he makes this statement, because it is a much more powerful plea for
   obtaining favor in the sight of God, to beseech him to maintain his own
   cause, because all the reproaches by which the simplicity of our faith
   is held up to scorn recoil upon himself, than to beseech him to do
   this, because he is wounded in the person of his Church; according as
   he declares in Isaiah,

   "Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed; and against whom hast thou
   exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the
   Holy One of Israel." (Isaiah 37:23)

   That wicked robber Rabshakeh thought that he scoffed only at the
   wretched Jews whom he besieged, and whose surrender of themselves into
   his hands he believed he would soon witness; but God took it as if he
   himself had been the object whom that wicked man directly assailed. On
   this account also, the prophet calls these enemies of his people the
   enemies of God; namely, because in persecuting the Church with deadly
   hostility, they made an assault upon the majesty of God, under whose
   protection the Church was placed.

   In the second clause, by the footsteps of Messiah or Christ is meant
   the coming of Christ, even as it is said in Isaiah 52:7,

   "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth
   good tidings, that publisheth peace!" (Isaiah 52:7)

   The Hebrew word qv, akeb, sometimes signifies the heel; but here, as in
   many other passages, it signifies the sole of the foot. Others
   translate it the pace or step, but this gives exactly the same sense.
   There can be no doubt, that footsteps, by the figure synecdoche, is
   employed to denote the feet; and again, that by the feet, according to
   the figure metonomy, is meant the coming of Christ. The wicked,
   observing that the Jews clung to the hope of redemption, and patiently
   endured all adversities because a deliverer had been promised them,
   disdainfully derided their patience, as if all that the prophets had
   testified concerning the coming of Christ had been only a fable. [560]
   And now also, although he has been once manifested to the world, yet
   as, in consequence of his having been received up into the glory of
   heaven, he seems to be far distant from us, and to have forsaken his
   Church, these filthy dogs scoff at our hope, as if it were a mere
   delusion.

   52. Blessed be Jehovah for ever! I am surprised why some interpreters
   should imagine, that this verse was added by some transcriber in
   copying the book, affirming, that it does not correspond with the
   context: as if the language of praise and thanksgiving to God were not
   as suitable at the close of a psalm as at the opening of it. I have
   therefore no doubt, that the prophet, after having freely bewailed the
   calamities of the Church, now, with the view of allaying the bitterness
   of his grief, purposely breaks forth into the language of praise. As to
   the words Amen, and Amen, I readily grant, that they are here employed
   to distinguish the book. [561] But whoever composed this psalm, there
   is no doubt, that by these words of rejoicing, the design of the writer
   was to assuage the greatness of his grief in the midst of his heavy
   afflictions, that he might entertain the livelier hope of deliverance.

   PSALM 90

   As Moses is about to treat as well of the brevity and miseries of human
   life, as of the punishments inflicted upon the people of Israel, in
   order to minister some consolation for assuaging the grief and fear
   which the faithful might have entertained upon observing the operation
   of the common law, to which all mankind are subject, and especially,
   upon considering their own afflictions, he opens the psalm by speaking
   of the peculiar grace which God had vouchsafed to his chosen tribes. He
   next briefly recites, how wretched the condition of men is, if they
   allow their hearts to rest in this world, especially when God summons
   them as guilty sinners to his judgment seat. And after he has bewailed,
   that even the children of Abraham had experienced for a time such
   severity, that they were almost consumed with sorrow, confiding in
   God's free favor, by which He had adopted them to himself, he prays
   that He would deal towards them in a merciful and gracious manner, as
   he had done in times past, and that he would continue even to the end
   the ordinary course of his grace.

   A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.

   It is uncertain whether this psalm was composed by Moses, or whether
   some one of the prophets framed it into a song for the use of the
   people, from a formula of prayer written by Moses, and handed down from
   age to age. It is, however, highly probable, that it is not without
   some ground ascribed to Moses in the title; and since psalms were in
   use even in his time, I have no doubt that he was its author. [562]
   Some maintain that the reason why his name appears in the inscription
   is, that it was sung by his posterity; but I cannot see why they should
   have recourse to such a groundless conceit. The epithet, The man of
   God, given to Moses, which is immediately added, clearly confutes them.
   [563] This honorable designation is expressly applied to him, that his
   doctrine may have the greater authority. If conjectures are to be
   admitted, it is probable, that when the time of his death drew near, he
   endited this prayer to assuage the prolonged sorrow under which the
   people had almost pined away, and to comfort their hearts, under the
   accumulation of adversities with which they were oppressed. Although
   the wonderful goodness of God shone brightly in their deliverance from
   Egypt, which, burying the miseries formerly endured by them, might have
   filled them with joy; yet we know that, soon after, it was extinguished
   by their ingratitude; so that for the space of not less than forty
   years, they were consumed with continual languor in the wilderness. It
   was therefore very seasonable for Moses at that time to beseech God
   that he would deal mercifully and gently with his people, according to
   the number of the years in which he had afflicted them.

   Psalm 90:1-2

   1. O Lord! thou hast been our dwelling-place, from generation to
   generation. 2. Before the mountains were brought forth, and before thou
   hadst formed the earth and the world, [564] even from everlasting to
   everlasting, thou art God.


   1 O Lord! thou hast been our dwelling-place. In separating the seed of
   Abraham by special privilege from the rest of the human family, the
   Psalmist magnifies the grace of adoption, by which God had embraced
   them as his children. The object which he has in view in this exordium
   is, that God would now renew the grace which he had displayed in old
   time towards the holy patriarchs, and continue it towards their
   offspring. Some commentators think that he alludes to the tabernacle,
   because in it the majesty of God was not less conspicuous than if he
   had dwelt in the midst of the people; but this seems to me to be
   altogether out of place. He rather comprehends the whole time in which
   the Fathers sojourned in the land of Canaan. As the tabernacle had not
   yet continued for the space of forty years, the long duration here
   mentioned -- our dwelling-place from generation to generation -- would
   not at all be applicable to it. It is not then intended to recount what
   God showed himself to be towards the Israelites from the time that he
   delivered them from Egypt; but what their fathers had experienced him
   to be in all ages, even from the beginning. [565] Now it is declared
   that as they had always been pilgrims and wanderers, so God was to them
   instead of a dwelling-place. No doubt, the condition of all men is
   unstable upon earth; but we know that Abraham and his posterity were,
   above all others, sojourners, and as it were exiles. Since, then, they
   wandered in the land of Canaan till they were brought into Egypt, where
   they lived only by sufferance from day to day, it was necessary for
   them to seek for themselves a dwelling-place under the shadow of God,
   without which they could hardly be accounted inhabitants of the world,
   since they continued everywhere strangers, and were afterwards led
   about through many windings and turnings. The grace which the Lord
   displayed in sustaining them in their wanderings, and shielding them
   with his hand when they sojourned among savage and cruel nations, and
   were exposed to injurious treatment at their hands -- this grace is
   extolled by Moses in very striking terms, when he represents God as an
   abode or dwelling-place to these poor fugitives who were continually
   wandering from one place to another in quest of lodgings. This grace he
   magnifies from the length of time during which it had been exercised;
   for God ceased not to preserve and defend them for the space of more
   than four hundred years, during which time they dwelt under the wings
   of his protection.

   2 Before the mountains were brought forth. Moses designs to set forth
   some high and hidden mystery, and yet he seems to speak feebly, and, as
   it were, in a puerile manner. For who does not know that God existed
   before the world? This we grant is a truth which all men admit; but we
   will scarcely find one in a hundred who is thoroughly persuaded that
   God remains unchangeably the same. God is here contrasted with created
   beings, who, as all know, are subject to continual changes, so that
   there is nothing stable under heaven. As, in a particular manner,
   nothing is fuller of vicissitude than human life, that men may not
   judge of the nature of God by their own fluctuating condition, he is
   here placed in a state of settled and undisturbed tranquillity. Thus
   the everlastingness of which Moses speaks is to be referred not only to
   the essence of God, but also to his providence, by which he governs the
   world. Although he subjects the world to many alterations, he remains
   unmoved; and that not only in regard to himself, but also in regard to
   the faithful, who find from experience, that instead of being wavering,
   he is steadfast in his power, truth, righteousness, and goodness, even
   as he has been from the beginning. This eternal and unchangeable
   steadfastness of God could not be perceived prior to the creation of
   the world, since there were as yet no eyes to be witnesses of it. But
   it may be gathered a posteriori; for while all things are subject to
   revolution and incessant vicissitude, his nature continues always the
   same. There may be also here a contrast between him and all the false
   gods of the heathen, who have, by little and little, crept into the
   world in such vast numbers, through the error and folly of men. But I
   have already shown the object which Moses has in view, which is, that
   we mistake if we measure God by our own understanding; and that we must
   mount above the earth, yea, even above heaven itself, whenever we think
   upon him.

   Psalm 90:3-8

   3. Thou shalt turn man to destruction, and shalt say, Return, ye sons
   of Adam. 4. For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday when it
   is gone, and as a watch in the night. 5. Thou carriest them away as
   with a flood, they will be a sleep: in the morning he shall grow as
   grass: 6. In the morning it shall flourish and grow: at the evening it
   shall be cut down, and shall wither. 7. For we fail by thy anger, and
   are affrighted by thy indignation. 8. Thou hast set our iniquities
   before thee, and our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.


   3 Thou shalt turn man to destruction. Moses, in the first place,
   mentions how frail and transitory is the life of man, and bewails its
   miseries. This he does, not for the purpose of quarrelling with God,
   but as an argument to induce him the more readily to exercise his
   mercy, even as he is elsewhere said to pardon mortal men, when he
   considers of what they are made, and remembers that they are but dust
   and grass, (Psalm 103:14.) he compares the course of our life to a ring
   or circle, because God, placing us upon the earth, turns us about
   within a narrow circuit, and when we have reached the last point, draws
   us back to himself in a moment. Others give a different interpretation,
   namely, that God leads men forth to death, and afterwards restores them
   at the resurrection. But this subtilty is far-fetched, and does not
   harmonise with the context. We have here laid down a simple definition
   of our life, that it is, as it were, a short revolution in which we
   quickly complete our circle, the last point of which is the termination
   of our earthly course. This account of human life sets in a clearer
   light the gracious manner in which God deals with his servants, in
   adopting them to be his peculiar people, that he may at length gather
   them together into his everlasting inheritance. Nor is it in vain that
   it is added, by way of contrast, (verse 4,) that a thousand years in
   God's sight are as yesterday Although we are convinced from experience
   that men, when they have completed their circle, are forthwith taken
   out of the world, yet the knowledge of this frailty fails in making a
   deep impression upon our hearts, because we do not lift our eyes above
   the world. Whence proceeds the great stupidity of men, who, bound fast
   to the present state of existence, proceed in the affairs of life as if
   they were to live two thousand years, but because they do not elevate
   their conceptions above visible objects? Each man, when he compares
   himself with others, flatters himself that he will live to a great age.
   In short, men are so dull as to think that thirty years, or even a
   smaller number, are, as it were, an eternity; nor are they impressed
   with the brevity of their life so long as this world keeps possession
   of their thoughts. This is the reason why Moses awakens us by elevating
   our minds to the eternity of God, without the consideration of which we
   perceive not how speedily our life vanishes away. The imagination that
   we shall have a long life, resembles a profound sleep in which we are
   all benumbed, until meditation upon the heavenly life swallow up this
   foolish fancy respecting the length of our continuance upon earth.

   As men are thus blinded, Moses sets before their view God as their
   judge. O Lord! as if he had said, if men would duly reflect upon that
   eternity from which thou beholdest these inconstant circlings of the
   world, they would not make so great account of the present life. But
   as, instead of seriously considering what is true duration, they rather
   wilfully turn away their eyes from heaven, this explains why they are
   so stupid, and look upon one day as if it were a hundred years. Moses'
   apostrophe to God is emphatic, implying that his patience being
   exhausted at seeing us so thoughtless, he addresses himself to God; and
   that it was labor to no purpose for him to speak to the deaf, who would
   not be taught that they were mortal, no, not even by the proofs of
   this, which experience was constantly presenting before them. This text
   is quoted by the Apostle Peter in a sense somewhat different, (2 Peter
   3:8,) while at the same time he does not pervert it, for he aptly and
   judiciously applies the testimony of Moses in illustration of the
   subject of which he is there treating. The design of Moses is to
   elevate the minds of men to heaven by withdrawing them from their own
   gross conceptions. And what is the object of Peter? As many, because
   Christ does not hasten his coming according to their desire, cast off
   the hope of the resurrection through the weariness of long delay, he
   corrects this preposterous impatience by a very suitable remedy. He
   perceives men's faith in the Divine promises fainting and failing, from
   their thinking that Christ delays his coming too long. Whence does this
   proceed, but because they grovel upon the earth? Peter therefore
   appropriately applies these words of Moses to cure this vice. As the
   indulgence in pleasures to which unbelievers yield themselves is to be
   traced to this, that having their hearts too much set upon the world,
   they do not taste the pleasures of a celestial eternity; so impatience
   proceeds from the same source. Hence we learn the true use of this
   doctrine. To what is it owing that we have so great anxiety about our
   life, that nothing suffices us, and that we are continually molesting
   ourselves, but because we foolishly imagine that we shall nestle in
   this world for ever? Again, to what are we to ascribe that extreme
   fretfulness and impatience, which make our hearts fail in waiting for
   the coming of Christ, but to their grovelling upon the earth? Let us
   learn then not to judge according to the understanding of the flesh,
   but to depend upon the judgment of God; and let us elevate our minds by
   faith, even to his heavenly throne, from which he declares that this
   earthly life is nothing. Nor does Moses simply contrast a thousand
   years with one day, but he contrasts them with yesterday, which is
   already gone; for whatever is still before our eyes has a hold upon our
   minds, but we are less affected with the recollection of what is past.
   In regard to the word watch, the ancients, as is well known, were
   accustomed to divide the night into four watches, consisting of three
   hours each. [566] To express still more forcibly how inconsiderable
   that which appears to us a long period is in God's eyes, this
   similitude is added, That a thousand years in his sight differ nothing
   from three hours of the night, in which men scarcely know whether they
   are awake or asleep.

   5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood. Moses confirms what he had
   previously said, That men, so long as they are sojourners in this
   world, perform, as it were, a revolution which lasts only for a moment.
   I do not limit the expression to carry away as with a flood to
   calamities of a more grievous kind, but consider that death is simply
   compared in general to a flood; for when we have staid a little while
   in the world, we forthwith fall into the grave and are covered with
   earth. Thus death, which is common to all, is with propriety called an
   inundation. While we are breathing the breath of life, the Lord
   overflows us by death, just as those who perish in a shipwreck are
   engulfed in the ocean; so that death may be fitly called an invisible
   deluge. And Moses affirms, that it is then evidently seen that men who
   flatter themselves that they are possessed of wonderful vigor in their
   earthly course, are only as a sleep. The comparison of grass which is
   added, amounts to this, That men come forth in the morning as grass
   springs up, that they become green, or pass away within a short time,
   when being cut down, they wither and decay. The verbs in the 6th verse
   being in the singular number, it is better to connect them with the
   word grass. But they may also be appropriately referred to each man;
   and as it makes little difference as to the sense of the text, whether
   we make grass or each man the nominative to the verbs, I am not
   disposed to expend much labor upon the matter. This doctrine requires
   to be continually meditated upon; for although we all confess that
   nothing is more transitory than our life, yet each of us is soon
   carried away, as it were, by a frantic impulse to picture to his own
   imagination an earthly immortality. Whoever bears in mind that he is
   mortal, restrains himself, that instead of having his attention and
   affections engrossed beyond measure with earthly objects, he may
   advance with haste to his mark. When we set no limit to our cares, we
   require to be urged forward by continual goadings, that we may not
   dream of a thousand lives instead of one, which is but as a shadow that
   quickly vanishes away.

   7 For we fail by thy anger. Moses makes mention of the anger of God
   advisedly; for it is necessary that men be touched with the feeling of
   this, in order to their considering in good earnest, what experience
   constrains them to acknowledge, how soon they finish their course and
   pass away. He had, however, still another reason for joining together
   the brevity of human life and the anger of God. Whilst men are by
   nature so transitory, and, as it were, shadowy, the Israelites were
   afflicted by the hostile hand of God; and his anger is less supportable
   by our frail natures, which speedily vanish away, than it would be were
   we furnished with some tolerable degree of strength.

   8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee. To show that by this
   complaint he is far from intending to murmur against God, he asserts
   that the Divine anger, however terrible it had been, was just, inasmuch
   as the people had provoked it by their iniquities; for those who, when
   stricken by the Divine hand, are not brought to genuine humiliation,
   harden themselves more and more. The true way to profit, and also to
   subdue our pride, is to feel that He is a righteous judge. Accordingly
   Moses, after having briefly taught that men by nature vanish away like
   smoke, gathers from thence that it is not to be wondered at if God
   exanimates and consumes those whom he pursues with his wrath. The
   manner of the expression by which God is described as showing the
   tokens of his anger is to be observed -- he sets the iniquities of men
   before his eyes Hence it follows, that whatever intermission of
   punishment we experience ought in justice to be ascribed to the
   forbearance of. God, who buries our sins that he may spare us. The word
   lvmym, alumim, which I have rendered our secret sins, is translated by
   some, our youth; [567] as if Moses had said that the faults committed
   in youth are brought to remembrance. But this is too forced, and
   inconsistent with the scope of the passage; for it would destroy the
   contrast between secret sins and the light of God's countenance, by
   which Moses intimates that men hide themselves in darkness, and wrap
   themselves in many deceits, so long as God does not shine upon them
   with the light of his judgment; whereas, when he draws them back from
   their subterfuges, by which they endeavor to escape from him, and sets
   before his eyes the sins which they hide by hypocrisy, being subdued by
   fear and dread, they are brought sincerely to humble themselves before
   him.

   awaked those who had slept all that quarter part of the night, it
   appeared to them but as a moment." -- Harmer's Observations, volume 1,

   that night watches were in use in his time.

   Psalm 90:9-10

   9. For all our days are passed away in thy indignation: we have spent
   our years as it were a thought. [568] 10. In the days of our years
   there are threescore years and ten: and if through strength they are
   fourscore years, yet is their pride but labor and grief; for it [569]
   swiftly passes by, and we fly away.


   9. For all our days are passed away in thy indignation. This might be
   viewed as a general confirmation of the preceding sentence, That the
   whole course of man's life is suddenly brought to an end, as soon as
   God shows himself displeased. But in my opinion Moses rather amplifies
   what he has said above concerning the rigour of God's wrath, and his
   strict examination of every case in which he punishes sin. He asserts
   that this terror which God brought upon his people was not only for a
   short time, but that it was extended without intermission even to
   death. He complains that the Jews had almost wasted away by continual
   miseries; because God neither remitted nor mitigated his anger. It is
   therefore not surprising to find him declaring that their years passed
   away like a tale, when God's anger rested upon them so unremittingly.

   10. In the days of our years there are threescore years and ten. He
   again returns to the general doctrine respecting the precariousness of
   the condition of men, although God may not openly display his wrath to
   terrify them. "What," says he, "is the duration of life? Truly, if we
   reckon all our years, we will at length come to threescore and ten, or,
   if there be some who are stronger and more vigorous, they will bring us
   even to fourscore." Moses uses the expression, the days of our years,
   for the sake of emphasis; for when the time is divided into small
   portions, the very number itself deceives us, so that we flatter
   ourselves that life is long. With the view of overthrowing these vain
   delusions, he permits men to sum up the many thousand days [570] which
   are in a few years; while he at the same time affirms that this great
   heap is soon brought to nothing. Let men then extend the space of their
   life as much as they please, by calculating that each year contains
   three hundred and sixty-five days; yet assuredly they will find that
   the term of seventy years is short. When they have made a lengthened
   calculation of the days, this is the sum in which the process
   ultimately results. He who has reached the age of fourscore years
   hastens to the grave. Moses himself lived longer, (Deuteronomy 34:7,)
   [571] and so perhaps did others in his time; but he speaks here of the
   ordinary term. And even then, those were accounted old men, and in a
   manner decrepit, who attained to the age of fourscore years; so that he
   justly declares that it is the robust only who arrive at that age. He
   puts pride for the strength or excellence of which men boast so highly.
   The sense is, that before men decline and come to old age, even in the
   very bloom of youth they are involved in many troubles, and that they
   cannot escape from the cares, weariness, sorrows, fears, griefs,
   inconveniences, and anxieties, to which this mortal life is subject.
   Moreover, this is to be referred to the whole course of our existence
   in the present state. And assuredly, he who considers what is the
   condition of our life from our infancy until we descend into the grave,
   will find troubles and turmoil in every part of it. The two Hebrew
   words ml, amal, and 'vn, aven, which are joined together, are taken
   passively for inconveniences and afflictions; implying that the life of
   man is full of labor, and fraught with many torments, and that even at
   the time when men are in the height of their pride. The reason which is
   added, for it swiftly passes by, and we fly away, seems hardly to suit
   the scope of the passage; for felicity may be brief, and yet on that
   account it does not cease to be felicity. But Moses means that men
   foolishly glory in their excellence, since, whether they will or no,
   they are constrained to look to the time to come. And as soon as they
   open their eyes, they see that they are dragged and carried forward to
   death with rapid haste, and that their excellence is every moment
   vanishing away.

   Psalm 90:11-13

   11. Who knoweth the power of thy anger? and according to thy fear, so
   is thy wrath. 12. Teach us so [572] to number our days, and we shall
   apply our hearts to wisdom. 13. Return, O Jehovah! how long? Be
   pacified towards thy servants.


   11. Who knoweth, the power of thy anger? Moses again returns to speak
   of the peculiar afflictions of the Israelites; for he had also on this
   occasion complained before of the common frailty and miseries of
   mankind. He justly exclaims that the power of God's wrath is
   immeasurably great. So long as God withholds his hand, men wantonly
   leap about like runaway slaves, who are no longer afraid at the sight
   of their master; nor can their rebellious nature be reduced to
   obedience in any other way than by his striking them with the fear of
   his judgment. The meaning then is, that whilst God hides himself, and,
   so to speak, dissembles his displeasure, men are inflated with pride,
   and rush upon sin with reckless impetuosity; but when they are
   compelled to feel how dreadful his wrath is, they forget their
   loftiness, and are reduced to nothing. What follows, According to thy
   fear, so is thy wrath, is commonly explained as denoting that the more
   a man is inspired with reverence towards God, the more severely and
   sternly is he commonly dealt with; for "judgment begins at the house of
   God," (1 Peter 4:17.) Whilst he pampers the reprobate with the good
   things of this life, he wastes his chosen ones with continual troubles;
   and in short, "whom he loveth he chasteneth," (Hebrews 12:6.) It is
   then a true and profitable doctrine that he deals more roughly with
   those who serve him than with the reprobate. But Moses, I think, has
   here a different meaning, which is, that it is a holy awe of God, and
   that alone, which makes us truly and deeply feel his anger. We see that
   the reprobate, although they are severely punished, only chafe upon the
   bit, or kick against God, or become exasperated, or are stupified, as
   if they were hardened against all calamities; so far are they from
   being subdued. And though they are full of trouble, and cry aloud, yet
   the Divine anger does not so penetrate their hearts as to abate their
   pride and fierceness. The minds of the godly alone are wounded with the
   wrath of God; nor do they wait for his thunderbolts, to which the
   reprobate hold out their hard and iron necks, but they tremble the very
   moment when God moves only his little finger. This I consider to be the
   true meaning of the prophet. He had said that the human mind could not
   sufficiently comprehend the dreadfulness of the Divine wrath. And we
   see how, although God shakes heaven and earth, many notwithstanding,
   like the giants of old, treat this with derision, and are actuated by
   such brutish arrogance, that they despise him when he brandishes his
   bolts. But as the Psalmist is treating of a doctrine which properly
   belongs to true believers, he affirms that they have a strongly
   sensitive feeling of the wrath of God which makes them quietly submit
   themselves to his authority. Although to the wicked their own
   conscience is a tormentor which does not suffer them to enjoy repose,
   yet so far is this secret dread from teaching them to humble
   themselves, that it excites them to clamor against God with increasing
   frowardness. In short, the faithful alone are sensible of God's wrath;
   and being subdued by it, they acknowledge that they are nothing, and
   with true humility devote themselves wholly to Him. This is wisdom to
   which the reprobate cannot attain, because they cannot lay aside the
   pride with which they are inflated. They are not touched with the
   feeling of God's wrath, because they do not stand in awe of him.

   12. Teach us so to number our days. Some translate to the number of our
   days, which gives the same sense. As Moses perceived that what he had
   hitherto taught is not comprehended by the understandings of men until
   God shine upon them by his Spirit, he now sets himself to prayer. It
   indeed seems at first sight absurd to pray that we may know the number
   of our years. What? since even the strongest scarcely reach the age of
   fourscore years, is there any difficulty in reckoning up so small a
   sum? Children learn numbers as soon as they begin to prattle; and we do
   not need a teacher in arithmetic to enable us to count the length of a
   hundred upon our fingers. So much the fouler and more shameful is our
   stupidity in never comprehending the short term of our life. Even he
   who is most skillful in arithmetic, and who can precisely and
   accurately understand and investigate millions of millions, is
   nevertheless unable to count fourscore years in his own life. It is
   surely a monstrous thing that men can measure all distances without
   themselves, that they know how many feet the moon is distant from the
   center of the earth, what space there is between the different planets;
   and, in short, that they can measure all the dimensions both of heaven
   and earth; while yet they cannot number threescore and ten years in
   their own case. It is therefore evident that Moses had good reason to
   beseech God for ability to perform what requires a wisdom which is very
   rare among mankind. The last clause of the verse is also worthy of
   special notice. By it he teaches us that we then truly apply our hearts
   to wisdom when we comprehend the shortness of human life. What can be a
   greater proof of madness than to ramble about without proposing to
   one's self any end? True believers alone, who know the difference
   between this transitory state and a blessed eternity, for which they
   were created, know what ought to be the aim of their life. No man then
   can regulate his life with a settled mind, but he who, knowing the end
   of it, that is to say death itself, is led to consider the great
   purpose of man's existence in this world, that he may aspire after the
   prize of the heavenly calling.

   13. Return, O Jehovah! how long? After having spoken in the language of
   complaint, Moses adds a prayer, That God, who had not ceased for a long
   time severely to punish his people, would at length be inclined to deal
   gently with them. Although God daily gave them in many ways some taste
   of his love, yet their banishment from the land of promise was a very
   grievous affliction; for it admonished them that they were unworthy of
   that blessed inheritance which he had appointed for his children. They
   could not fail often to remember that dreadful oath which he had
   thundered out against them,

   "Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,
   neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: But as for you, your
   carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness,"
   (Numbers 14:23, 32.) [573]

   Moses, no doubt, combines that sore bondage which they had suffered in
   Egypt with their wanderings in the wilderness; and therefore he justly
   bewails their protracted languishing in the words how long? As God is
   said to turn his back upon us, or to depart to a distance from us, when
   he withdraws the tokens of his favor, so by his return we are to
   understand the manifestation of his grace. The word nchm, nacham, which
   we have translated be pacified, signifies to repent, and may therefore
   not improperly be explained thus: Let it repent thee concerning thy
   servants. According to the not unfrequent and well known phraseology of
   Scripture, God is said to repent, when putting away men's sorrow, and
   affording new ground of gladness, he appears as it were to be changed.
   Those, however, seem to come nearer the mind of the Psalmist who
   translate, Comfort thyself over thy servants; for God, in cherishing us
   tenderly, takes no less pleasure in us than does a father in his own
   children. Now that is nothing else than to be pacified or propitious,
   as we have translated it, to make the meaning the more obvious.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [572] Moses, as we learn from the passage to which Calvin refers, "was
   an hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor
   his natural force abated." He was eighty years old when God made him
   captain of the chosen people; and Aaron was eighty-three years old
   before he was made High Priest, Exodus 7:7. These, and a few other
   similar cases, have led many to conclude that the age of eighty was not
   considered at that time the age of decrepitude; and consequently that
   this psalm, which limits the average length of human life to seventy or
   eighty years, must be of a later date than the time of Moses. But this
   is no valid argument against his being its penman. According to Calvin,
   seventy or eighty years was at that time, in general, the utmost limits
   of human life; and the longevity of Moses and some others who exceeded
   that limit was an exception to the general rule. If this should be
   called in question, it might be observed that this psalm treats of the
   afflictions and brevity of life, not in reference to all men
   absolutely, but with respect to the Israelites in particular, who, on
   account of their murmuring at the report of the spies who had been sent
   to spy out the land of Canaan, and other sins, provoked God to swear in
   his wrath that the carcases of all that were numbered of them according
   to their whole number, from twenty years old and upwards, with the
   exception of Caleb and Joshua, should fall in the wilderness during the
   forty years of their wandering in it, (Numbers 14:27-29.) Few of them,
   therefore, could have exceeded or even reached the age of fourscore
   years. It has been thought by some that at that time human life all
   over the world was reduced to the measure here specified, as its
   average standard. "The decree which abbreviated the life of man as a
   general rule to seventy or eighty years," observes Dr J. M. Good, "was
   given as a chastisement upon the whole race of Israelites in the
   wilderness. It does not appear that the term of life was lengthened
   afterwards. Samuel died about seventy years old, David under
   seventy-one, and Solomon under sixty; and the history of the world
   shows that the abbreviation of life in other countries was nearly in
   the same proportion."

   [573] "There is an ambiguity in kn, as it denotes either so or rightly
   Hence the interpretation is twofold; either so make us to know that we
   may cause a heart of wisdom to come,' i e., so instruct us that we may
   acquire a wise heart. Or, teach us to number our days rightly,' etc.
   LXX. give it another and distorted interpretation." -- Bythner

   Psalm 90:14-17

   14. Satiate us early [574] with thy goodness, and we will be glad and
   rejoice all our days. 15. Make us joyful according to the days of our
   affliction; according to the years in which we have seen evil. 16. Let
   thy work appear towards thy servants, and thy glory upon their
   children. 17. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and
   direct the work of our hands upon us; yea, direct thou the work of our
   hands.


   16 Let thy work appear towards thy servants. As God, when he forsakes
   his Church, puts on as it were a character different from his own,
   Moses, with much propriety, calls the blessing of protection which had
   been divinely promised to the children of Abraham God's proper work.
   Although, therefore, God's work was manifest in all the instances in
   which he had punished the perfidiousness, ingratitude, obstinacy,
   unruly lusts, and unhallowed desires of his people, yet Moses, by way
   of eminence, prefers before all other proofs of God's power, that care
   which he exercised in maintaining the welfare of the people, by which
   it was his will that he should be principally known. This is the reason
   why Paul, in Romans 9:23, especially applies to the Divine goodness the
   honorable title of "glory." God indeed maintains his glory by judging
   the world; but as nothing is more natural to him than to show himself
   gracious, his glory on that account is said to shine forth chiefly in
   his benefits. With respect to the present passage, God had then only
   begun to deliver his people; for they had still to be put in possession
   of the land of Canaan. Accordingly, had they gone no farther than the
   wilderness, the lustre of their deliverance would have been obscured.
   Besides, Moses estimates the work of God according to the Divine
   promise; and doing this he affirms that it will be imperfect and
   incomplete, unless he continue his grace even to the end. This is
   expressed still more plainly in the second clause of the verse, in
   which he prays not only for the welfare of his own age, but also for
   the welfare of the generation yet unborn. His exercise thus corresponds
   with the form of the covenant,

   "And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed
   after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenants to be a
   God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee,"
   (Genesis 17:7.)

   By this example we are taught, that in our prayers we ought to extend
   our care to those who are to come after us. As God has promised that
   the Church will be perpetuated even to the end of the world, -- a
   subject which was brought under our notice in the preceding psalm, --
   this ought, in a special manner, to lead us in all the prayers by which
   we commend the welfare of the Church to him, to include, at the same
   time, our posterity who are yet unborn. Farther, the words glory and
   beauty are to be particularly noticed: from which we learn that the
   love which God bears towards us is unparalleled. Although, in enriching
   us with his gifts he gains nothing for himself; yet he would have the
   splendor and beauty of his character manifested in dealing bountifully
   with us, as if his beauty were obscured when he ceases to do us good.
   In the clause immediately succeeding, Direct the work of our hands upon
   us, Moses intimates that we cannot undertake or attempt anything with
   the prospect of success, unless God become our guide and counsellor,
   and govern us by his Spirit. Whence it follows, that the reason why the
   enterprises and efforts of worldly men have a disastrous issue is,
   because, in not following God, they pervert all order and throw
   everything into confusion. Nor is the word lynv, alenu, upon us,
   superfluous; for although God converts to good in the end whatever
   Satan and the reprobate plot and practice against him or his people;
   yet the Church, in which God rules with undisturbed sway, has in this
   respect a special privilege. By his providence, which to us is
   incomprehensible, he directs his work in regard to the reprobate
   externally; but he governs his believing people internally by his Holy
   Spirit; and therefore he is properly said to order or direct the work
   of their hands. The repetition shows that a continual course of
   perseverance in the grace of God is required. It would not be enough
   for us to be brought to the midst of our journey. He must enable us to
   complete the whole course. Some translate, confirm or establish; and
   this sense may be admitted. I have, however, followed that translation
   which was more agreeable to the context, conceiving the prayer to be
   that God would direct to a prosperous issue all the actions and
   undertakings of his people.

   [574] The great mortality constantly taking place among them could not
   but remind them of this oath. Dimock calculates that the number of
   persons who died in the wilderness, from twenty years old and upwards,
   was one year with another near 15,000.

   [562] "Pour faire la fin de ce livre troisieme." -- Fr. "As a
   conclusion to this third Book." The Psalter, as we have before
   observed, has been divided by the Hebrews into five books. This is the
   end of Book 3. See [21]volume 2, page 126, note.

   [563] All the ancient versions ascribe this psalm to Moses, and it is
   generally agreed, that it was written by him. To him also, R. Selomo,
   and other Jewish commentators, ascribe the nine following psalms; for
   which they do not appear to have any other foundation but their own
   absurd canon of criticism, by which they assign all anonymous psalms to
   that author whose name last occurred in a preceding title. It is
   evident, for instance, that the 99th psalm, in which the prophet Samuel
   is mentioned, could not have been written by Moses.

   PSALM 91

   In this psalm we are taught that God watches over the safety of his
   people, and never fails them in the hour of danger. They are exhorted
   to advance through all perils, secure in the confidence of his
   protection. The truth inculcated is one of great use, for though many
   talk much of God's providence, and profess to believe that he exercises
   a special guardianship over his own children, few are found actually
   willing to intrust their safety to him. [575]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 91:1-4

   1. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the High One shall abide
   under the shadow of the Almighty. 2. I will say to Jehovah, He is my
   hope and my fortress: my God; in him will I hope. 3. Surely he shall
   deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, from the noxious pestilence.
   4. He shall protect thee with his wings, and under his feathers shalt
   thou be safe; his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.


   1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the High One. Some Hebrew
   interpreters read the three first verses as one continuous sentence,
   down to the words, he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler
   The whole would then run thus -- "He who dwells in the covert of the
   Most High, and abides under his shadow, to him will I say of Jehovah,
   that he is his hope and defense, and the God in whom he may safely
   rest, for he shall deliver him from the snare," etc. This is evidently
   a forced construction to put upon the verses, and the reason which has
   led some to adopt it is weak and insufficient. They consider that the
   first verse repeats the same thing twice, and therefore conveys no
   proper meaning. But this is a great mistake; for the inspired penman of
   the psalm, whoever he may have been, states two ideas quite distinct,
   That he who is hid under the Divine protection occupies a safe and
   secure position, where no hostile weapon can reach him. Or should the
   verse be read -- He who has God to be the guardian of his safety shall
   rest under the shadow of God; still the second clause would retain an
   emphatic meaning, for the power of God would be contrasted with that
   weak defense which man is able to extend. Those, too, who dwell in the
   secret place of God are here said by the Psalmist to dwell under his
   shadow, in the sense that they experience to what a rich extent his
   protection reaches. Men generally seek out a great-variety of
   hiding-places, having recourse to one or another, according as the
   calamities are different which threaten to overtake them; but here we
   are taught that the only safe and impregnable fortress to which we can
   betake ourselves is the protection of God. He contrasts the security of
   those who trust in God with the vanity of all other confidences by
   which we are apt to delude ourselves.

   In the second verse he repeats the truth which he had already
   inculcated, showing at the same time that he speaks from his personal
   feeling and experience as a believer. This is very necessary in one who
   would be a teacher; for we cannot communicate true knowledge unless we
   deliver it not merely with the lips, but as something which God has
   revealed to our own hearts. [576] The Psalmist accordingly gives
   evidence, that what he had taught in the preceding verse accorded with
   his own inward experience. Some read, I will say concerning the Lord,
   and the Hebrew prefix, l, lamed, may be so rendered; but the other
   translation which I have given conveys the more forcible meaning. The
   believer does more than simply resolve to make God his fortress; he
   draws near in the trust of the Divine promises, and familiarly
   addresses God. This confidence in prayer affords an additional proof
   how securely the people of God can dwell under his shadow. This holy
   species of boasting constitutes the very highest triumph of faith, when
   we betake ourselves to God without fear under our worst trials, and are
   fully persuaded that he answers all our prayers, nay, that we have in
   him a sufficiency and a superabundance of help.

   In verse third the Psalmist expresses his assurance that the trust of
   which he had spoken would not be vain and delusory, but that God would
   prove at all times the deliverer of his people. He is evidently to be
   considered as addressing himself, and in this way encouraging his own
   heart to hope in the Lord. Some think that by the snare of the fowler,
   spoken of here in connection with the pestilence, is to be understood
   hidden mischief as distinguished from open aggression, and that the
   Psalmist declares the Divine protection to be sufficient for him,
   whether Satan should attack him openly and violently or by more secret
   and subtle methods. I would not reject this interpretation; for though
   some may think that the words should be taken in their simpler
   acceptation, the Psalmist most probably intended under these terms to
   denote all different kinds of evil, and to teach us that God was
   willing and able to deliver us from any of them.

   4 He shall protect thee with his wings. This figure, which is employed
   in other parts of Scripture, is one which beautifully expresses the
   singularly tender care with which God watches over our safety. When we
   consider the majesty of God, there is nothing which would suggest a
   likeness such as is here drawn between him and the hen or other birds,
   who spread their wings over their young ones to cherish and protect
   them. But, in accommodation to our infirmity, he does not scruple to
   descend, as it were, from the heavenly glory which belongs to him, and
   to encourage us to approach him under so humble a similitude. Since he
   condescends in such a gracious manner to our weakness, surely there is
   nothing to prevent us from coming to him with the greatest freedom. By
   the truth of God, which, the Psalmist says, would be his shield and
   buckler, we must understand God's faithfulness, as never deserting his
   people in the time of their need; still we cannot doubt that he had in
   his eye the Divine promises, for it is only by looking to these that
   any can venture to cast themselves upon the protection of God. As,
   without the word, we cannot come to the enjoyment of that Divine mercy
   of which the Psalmist had already spoken, he now comes forward himself
   to bear witness in behalf of it. Formerly, under the comparison of a
   fortress, he had taught that by trusting in God we shall enjoy safety
   and security; now he compares God to a shield, intimating that he will
   come between us and all our enemies to preserve us from their attacks.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [576] This psalm is allowed to be one of the finest in the whole
   collection. "Could the Latin or any modern language," says Simon de
   Muis, "express thoroughly all the beauties and elegancies as well of
   the words as of the sentences, it would not be difficult to persuade
   the reader that we have no poem, either in Greek or Latin, comparable
   to this Hebrew ode." It is supposed by some to have been composed by
   Moses on the same occasion as the preceding; but others think it was
   written by David on the occasion of the pestilence which was inflicted
   upon the people as a punishment of his sin in numbering them, (2 Samuel
   24.) It is ascribed to David in the Septuagint, Chaldee, Vulgate,
   Syriac, Arabic, and Æthiopic versions. Its subject-matter affords us no
   assistance in determining who was its inspired author, or on what
   occasion it was written. "There is, however, no reason," says Walford,
   "to regret our unacquaintedness with these particulars, as the poem is
   so clear and intelligible, that nothing in it can be mistaken or
   misunderstood. The purpose of it is to illustrate the safety and
   happiness which result from the knowledge of God, and the exercise of a
   steadfast dependence upon his promise and grace. The sentiments are
   expressed with great force and beauty; and dead indeed must be the soul
   to every emotion of spiritual and heavenly delight that fails to be
   impressed by its truth, or to aim at the acquirement of such faith and
   reliance upon it as will alone render it productive of the peace and
   tranquillity of mind which it is intended to bestow. The learned
   Michaelis is of opinion that this psalm was to be recited in alternate
   parts by two choruses or sets of singers responding to each other, and
   that God himself is introduced in verse 14 as taking part of the
   performance." It is supposed by the Jews to relate to the Messiah. See
   Matthew 4:6; Luke 4:10, 11.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 91:5-8

   5. Thou shalt not fear for the terror of the night; for the arrow that
   flieth by day; 6. For the destruction that walketh in darkness; for the
   pestilence [577] which wasteth at noon-day. [578] 7. A thousand shall
   fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; it shall not come
   nigh thee. 8. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward
   of the wicked.


   5 Thou shalt not fear for the terror of the night. The Psalmist
   continues to insist upon the truth which I have just adverted to, that,
   if we confide with implicit reliance upon the protection of God, we
   will be secure from every temptation and assault of Satan. It is of
   importance to remember, that those whom God has taken under his care
   are in a state of the most absolute safety. Even those who have reached
   the most advanced experience find nothing more difficult than to rely
   upon Divine deliverance; and more especially when, overtaken by some of
   the many forms in which danger and death await us in this world, doubts
   will insinuate themselves into our hearts, giving rise to fear and
   disquietude. There was reason, therefore, why the Psalmist should enter
   upon a specification of different evils, encouraging the Lord's people
   to look for more than one mode of deliverance, and to bear up under
   various and accumulated calamities. Mention is made of the fear of the
   night, because men are naturally apprehensive in the dark, or because
   the night exposes us to dangers of different kinds, and our fears are
   apt at such a season to magnify any sound or disturbance. The arrow,
   rather than another weapon, is instanced as flying by day, for the
   reason apparently that it shoots to a greater distance, and with such
   swiftness, that we can with difficulty escape it. The verse which
   follows states, though in different words, the same truth, that there
   is no kind of calamity which the shield of the Almighty cannot ward off
   and repel.

   7 A thousand shall fall at thy side. [579] He proceeds to show that,
   though the state of all men may to appearance be alike, the believer
   has the special privilege of being exempted from evils of an imminent
   and impending nature; for it might be objected that he was but man,
   and, as such, exposed with others to death in its thousand different
   forms. To correct this mistake, the Psalmist does not hesitate to
   assert that, when universal ruin prevails around, the Lord's children
   are the objects of his distinguishing care, and are preserved amidst
   the general destruction. The lesson is one which is needed by us all,
   that, though naturally subject to the common evils which are spread
   around, we are privileged with a special exemption which secures our
   safety in the midst of dangers. In the verse succeeding more is meant
   than merely that the believer will have personal experience of the
   truth which the Psalmist had stated, actually feeling and seeing with
   his own eyes that God manages his defense; a new argument is brought
   forward in support of the truth, which is this, that God, as the
   righteous judge of the world, cannot but punish the wicked according to
   their sins, and extend protection to his own children. There is much
   that is dark in the aspect of things in this world, yet the Psalmist
   hints that, amidst all the confusion which reigns, we may collect from
   what we see of God's judgments, that he does not disappoint the
   expectations of his believing people. He must be considered, however,
   as addressing those who have eyes to see, who are privileged with the
   true light of faith, who are fully awake to the consideration of the
   Divine judgments, and who wait patiently and quietly till the proper
   time arrive; for most men stagger and confuse their minds upon this
   subject, by starting to precipitate conclusions, and are prevented from
   discovering the providence of God by judging according to sense. It
   becomes us too to be satisfied with apprehending the judgments of God
   only in some imperfect measure while we remain upon earth, and leaving
   him to defer the fuller discovery of them to the day of complete
   revelation.

   [578] The original word, which Calvin renders "the pestilence," is
   rendered in the Syriac "the blowing wind." Fry's version has "the
   blast." "The simoon, or hot wind of the desert," he observes, "a
   phenomenon in those regions too remarkable to have escaped the divine
   poet in enumerating the sources of danger to human life." This wind
   being hot and burning in its effects, when it blows at noon-day, must
   be still more fatal.

   [579] "Verses 5 and 6. Jos. Scaliger explains, in Epis. 9, these two
   verses thus: -- Thou shalt not fear, mphhr, from consternation by
   night, mchph, from the arrow flying by day, mdvr, from pestilence
   walking at evening, mqtv, from devastation at noon Under these four he
   comprehends all the evils and dangers to which man is liable. And as
   the Hebrews divide the four and twenty hours of day and night into four
   parts, namely, evening, midnight, morning, and mid-day, so he
   understands the hours of danger to be divided accordingly: in a word,
   that the man, who has made God his refuge,' is always safe, day and
   night, at every hour, from every danger." -- Bythner

   Psalm 91:9-12

   9. Because thou, Jehovah, art my protection; thou hast made the Most
   High thy refuge. [580] 10. There shall no evil befall thee, and no
   plague shall come nigh thy dwelling. 11. For he has given his angels
   charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 12. They shall
   bear thee upon their hands, lest thou dash thy foot upon a stone,


   9 Because thou, Jehovah, art my protection. He dwells at this length in
   commendation of the providence of God, as knowing how slow men
   naturally are to resort to God in a right manner; and how much they
   need to be stimulated to this duty, and to be driven from those false
   and worldly refuges in which they confide. There is a change of person
   frequently throughout this psalm: thus, in the first verse, he
   addresses God, and afterwards addresses himself. God he styles his
   protection, -- in this manner, by his own example, recommending others
   to have recourse to God as their help. So, afterwards, he addresses
   himself, that he may be the better persuaded of the sincerity of his
   inward affection. The true method of testing our faith is to turn our
   thoughts inward upon ourselves, and, when no human eye sees us, to
   search our own spirits. If, not content with having to do with God
   only, we turn our eyes to men, it is almost impossible to prevent pride
   from insinuating itself into the room of faith. He speaks of accounting
   God to be his house or refuge, because he defends us from every evil,
   as in Psalm 90:1. This verse may be considered as connected with that
   which follows, and as stating the cause or reason of what is there
   asserted; for it is added, There shall no evil befall thee. And how are
   coming evils averted, but just by our resting with confidence in the
   protection of God? Troubles, it is true, of various kinds assail the
   believer as well as others, but the Psalmist means that God stands
   between him and the violence of every assault, so as to preserve him
   from being overwhelmed. The Divine guardianship is represented as
   extending to the whole household of the righteous; and we know that God
   comprehends under his love the children of such as he has adopted into
   his fatherly favor. Or, perhaps, the term may be taken in its simpler
   sense, and nothing more be intended than that those who choose God for
   their refuge will dwell safely in their houses.

   11 For he has given his angels charge concerning thee. This is added by
   the Psalmist expressly with the view of obviating any fears which might
   arise from our infirmity; so that we cannot fail to be struck with the
   benignant condescension of God in thus not only forgiving our
   diffidence, but proposing the means by which it may be best removed.
   Does he exhibit himself to us as a fortress and shield, proffer the
   shadow of his protection, make himself known to us as a habitation in
   which we may abide, and stretch out his wings for our defense -- surely
   we are chargeable with the worst ingratitude if we are not satisfied
   with promises so abundantly full and satisfactory? If we tremble to
   think of his majesty, he presents himself to us under the lowly figure
   of the hen: if we are terrified at the power of our enemies, and the
   multitude of dangers by which we are beset, he reminds us of his own
   invincible power, which extinguishes every opposing force. When even
   all these attempts to encourage us have been tried, and he finds that
   we still linger and hesitate to approach him, or cast ourselves upon
   his sole and exclusive protection, he next makes mention of the angels,
   and proffers them as guardians of our safety. As an additional
   illustration of his indulgent mercy, and compassion for our weakness,
   he represents those whom he has ready for our defense as being a
   numerous host; he does not assign one solitary angel to each saint, but
   commissions the whole armies of heaven to keep watch over every
   individual believer. It is the individual believer whom the Psalmist
   addresses, as we read also Psalm 34:7 -- that "angels encamp round
   about them that fear him." We may learn from this that there is no
   truth in the idea that each saint has his own peculiar guardian angel;
   and it is of no little consequence to consider, that as our enemies are
   numerous, so also are the friends to whom our defense is intrusted. It
   were something, no doubt, to know that even one angel was set over us
   with this commission, but it adds weight to the promise when we are
   informed that the charge of our safety is committed to a numerous host,
   as Elisha was enabled, by a like consideration, to despise the great
   army of adversaries which was arrayed against him, (2 Kings 6:16.) Nor
   is this inconsistent with passages of Scripture, which seem to speak as
   if a distinct angel were assigned to each individual. It is evident
   that God employs his angels in different ways, setting one angel over
   several whole nations, and again several angels over one man. There is
   no necessity that we should be nice and scrupulous in inquiring into
   the exact manner in which they minister together for our safety; it is
   enough that, knowing from the authority of an apostle the fact of their
   being appointed ministers to us, we should rest satisfied of their
   being always intent upon their commission. We read elsewhere of their
   readiness to obey and execute the commands of God; and this must go to
   strengthen our faith, since their exertions are made use of by God for
   our defense.

   The Psalmist, in the passage now before us, speaks of members of the
   Church generally; and yet the devil did not wrest the words when, in
   his temptation in the wilderness, he applied them particularly to
   Christ. It is true that he is constantly seeking to pervert and corrupt
   the truth of God; but, so far as general principles are concerned, he
   can put a specious gloss upon things, and is a sufficiently acute
   theologian. It is to be considered that when our whole human family
   were banished from the Divine favor, we ceased to have anything in
   common with the angels, and they to have any communication with us. It
   was Christ, and he only, who, by removing the ground of separation,
   reconciled the angels to us; this being his proper office, as the
   apostle observes, (Ephesians 1:10,) to gather together in one what had
   been dispersed both in heaven and on earth. This was represented to the
   holy patriarch Jacob under the figure of a ladder, (Genesis 28:12;)
   and, in allusion to our being united into one collective body with the
   angels, Christ said,

   "Afterwards ye shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of God
   ascending and descending," (John 1:51.)

   The Psalmist adds, all your ways in the plural number, to convey to us
   more distinctly that wherever we go we may expect that the angels shall
   always extend their guardianship to us. The course of our life is
   subject to many windings and changes, and who can tell all the storms
   by which we are liable to be tossed? It was necessary, therefore, to
   know that the angels preside over all our particular actions and
   purposes, and thus to be assured of their safe-conduct in whatever
   quarter we might be called to move. This expression, however, your
   ways, was, in all likelihood, intended to enjoin upon us a due
   consideration and modesty, to warn us against tempting God by any rash
   step, and admonish us to confine ourselves within the bounds of our
   proper calling. For should we commit ourselves recklessly, and attempt
   things which the promise of God does not warrant us to undertake,
   aspiring at what is presumptuous, and opposed to the Divine will, we
   are not to expect that the angels will become ministers and helps to
   our temerity. Satan would appear to have craftily omitted this clause
   when he tempted Christ rashly to throw himself down from the temple.

   12 They shall bear thee upon their hands. He gives us a still higher
   idea of the guardianship of the angels, informing us, that they not
   only watch lest any evil should befall us, and are on the alert to
   extend assistance, but bear up our steps with their hands, so as to
   prevent us from stumbling in our course. Were we to judge indeed by
   mere appearances, the children of God are far from being thus borne up
   aloft in their career; often they labor and pant with exertion,
   occasionally they stagger and fall, and it is with a struggle that they
   advance in their course; but as in the midst of all this weakness it is
   only by the singular help of God that they are preserved every moment
   from falling and from being destroyed, we need not wonder that the
   Psalmist should speak in such exalted terms of the assistance which
   they receive through the ministrations of angels. Never, besides, could
   we surmount the serious obstacles which Satan opposes to our prayers,
   unless God should bear us up in the manner here described. Let any one
   combine together the two considerations which have been mentioned, --
   our own utter weakness on the one hand, and on the other the roughness,
   the difficulties, the thorns which beset our way, the stupidity besides
   which characterises our hearts, and the subtlety of the evil one in
   laying snares for our destruction, -- and he will see that the language
   of the Psalmist is not that of hyperbole, that we could not proceed one
   step did not the angels bear us up in their hands in a manner beyond
   the ordinary course of nature. That we frequently stumble is owing to
   our own fault in departing from him who is our head and leader. And
   though God suffers us to stumble and fall in this manner that he may
   convince us how weak we are in ourselves, yet, inasmuch as he does not
   permit us to be crushed or altogether overwhelmed, it is virtually even
   then as if he put his hand under us and bore us up.

   Psalm 91:13-16

   13. Thou shalt walk over the lion and asp, the young lion and dragon
   shalt thou trample under feet. 14. Because he hath trusted in me, I
   will deliver him; because he hath known my name, I will set him on
   high. 15. He shall call upon me, and I shall answer him: I will be with
   him in trouble; I will deliver him, and glorify him. 16. With length of
   days will I satisfy him, and I will show him my salvation.


   13. Thou shalt walk over the lion and asp. The same truth is here
   expressed in different words. He had already spoken of the obstacles
   which Satan throws in our course under the figure of a stone. Now he
   speaks of the formidable troubles to which we are exposed in the world
   under the figures of the asp, lion, young lion, and dragon So long as
   we are here we may be truly said to walk amongst wild beasts, and such
   as threaten us with destruction. And in this case what would become of
   us did not God promise to make us victorious over the manifold evils
   which everywhere impend us? None who seriously considers the
   temptations to which he is liable will wonder that the Psalmist, with
   the view of removing apprehension from the minds of the Lord's people,
   should have adopted the language of hyperbole; nor indeed will he say
   that it is the language of hyperbole, but a true and exact
   representation of their case. We boast much of our courage so long as
   we remain at a distance from the scene of danger; but no sooner are we
   brought into action, than in the smallest matters we conjure up to
   ourselves lions, and dragons, and a host of frightful dangers. The
   Psalmist accommodates his language to this infirmity of our carnal
   apprehension. The Hebrew word schl, shachal, which in the Septuagint is
   rendered asp, [581] signifies a lion, and such repetition in the second
   member of the sentence is usual in the Hebrew. There is therefore no
   occasion for seeking any nice distinction which may have been intended
   in specifying these four different kinds of animals; only by the lion
   and young lion we are evidently to understand more open dangers, where
   we are assailed by force and violence, and by the serpent and dragon
   hidden mischiefs, where the enemy springs upon us insidiously and
   unexpectedly, as the serpent from its lurking place. [582]

   14. Because he hath trusted in me, I will deliver him. It may prevent
   any feeling of disgust or weariness under the repetition and
   enlargement of the Psalmist upon his present subject, to remember,
   that, as I have already observed, he is influenced in this by a due
   consideration of our weakness, ever indisposed, as we are upon the
   approach of danger, to exercise a due reliance upon the providence of
   God. With this view he now introduces God himself as speaking, and
   confirming by his own voice what had already been asserted. And here it
   is noticeable that God, in declaring from heaven that we shall be safe
   under the wings of his protection, speaks of nothing as necessary on
   the part of his people but hope or trust. For the Hebrew verb chsq,
   chashak, which signifies to desire, or love, or, as we commonly express
   it, to find our delight in any object, means here to rest with a sweet
   confidence in God, and rejoice in his favor. He engages to extend us
   assistance, if we seek him in sincerity. The language implies that we
   must be continually surrounded by death and destruction in this world,
   unless his hand is stretched out for our preservation. Occasionally he
   assists even unbelievers, but it is only to his believing people that
   his help is vouchsafed, in the sense of his being their Savior to the
   true extent of that term, and their Savior to the end. Their knowing
   the name of God is spoken of in connection with their trust and
   expectation; and very properly, for why is it that men are found
   casting their eyes vainly round them to every quarter in the hour of
   danger, but because they are ignorant of the power of God? They cannot
   indeed be said to know God at all, but delude themselves with a vague
   apprehension of something which is not God, a mere dead idol
   substituted for him in their imaginations. As it is a true knowledge of
   God which begets confidence in him, and leads us to call upon him; and
   as none can seek him sincerely but those who have apprehended the
   promises, and put due honor upon his name, the Psalmist with great
   propriety and truth represents this knowledge as being the spring or
   fountain of trust. That the doctrine which he teaches was needful we
   may learn from the senseless and erroneous manner in which the Papists
   speak of faith. While they inculcate an implicit adherence to God, they
   bury the word which opens up the only access which men can have to him.
   The expression to exalt or lift up on high means no more than to keep
   in a state of safety or security; but the reason of this metaphor is,
   that God preserves his people in an extraordinary manner, raising them,
   as it were, to some high and impregnable fortress.

   15. He shall call upon me. He now shows more clearly what was meant by
   trusting in God, or placing our love and delight in him. For that
   affection and desire which is produced by faith, prompts us to call
   upon his name. This is another proof in support of the truth, which I
   had occasion to touch upon formerly, that prayer is properly grounded
   upon the word of God. We are not at liberty in this matter, to follow
   the suggestions of our own mind or will, but must seek God only in so
   far as he has in the first place invited us to approach him. The
   context, too, may teach us, that faith is not idle or inoperative, and
   that one test, by which we ought to try those who look for Divine
   deliverances, is, whether they have recourse to God in a right manner.
   We are taught the additional lesson, that believers will never be
   exempt from troubles and embarrassments. God does not promise them a
   life of ease and luxury, but deliverance from their tribulations.
   Mention is made of his glorifying them, intimating that the deliverance
   which God extends, and which has been spoken of in this psalm, is not
   of a mere temporary nature, but will issue at last in their being
   advanced to perfect happiness. He puts much honor upon them in the
   world, and glorifies himself in them conspicuously, but it is not till
   the completion of their course that he affords them ground for triumph.
   It may seem strange that length of days should be mentioned in the last
   verse as promised to them, since many of the Lord's people are soon
   taken out of the world. But I may repeat an observation which has been
   elsewhere made, that those Divine blessings which are promised in
   relation to the present perishing world, are not to be considered as
   made good in a universal and absolute sense, or fulfilled in all
   according to one set and equal rule. [583] Wealth and other worldly
   comforts must be looked upon as affording some experience of the Divine
   favor or goodness, but it does not follow that the poor are objects of
   the Divine displeasure; soundness of body and good health are blessings
   from God, but we must not conceive on this account that he regards with
   disapprobation the weak and the infirm. Long life is to be classed
   among benefits of this kind, and would be bestowed by God upon all his
   children, were it not for their advantage that they should be taken
   early out of the world. [584] They are more satisfied with the short
   period during which they live than the wicked, though their life should
   be extended for thousands of years. The expression cannot apply to the
   wicked, that they are satisfied with length of days; for however long
   they live, the thirst of their desires continues to be unquenched. It
   is life, and nothing more, which they riot in with such eagerness; nor
   can they be said to have had one moment's enjoyment of that Divine
   favor and goodness which alone can communicate true satisfaction. The
   Psalmist might therefore with propriety state it as a privilege
   peculiarly belonging to the Lord's people, that they are satisfied with
   life. The brief appointed term is reckoned by them to be sufficient,
   abundantly sufficient. Besides, longevity is never to be compared with
   eternity. The salvation of God extends far beyond the narrow boundary
   of earthly existence; and it is to this, whether we live or come to
   die, that we should principally look. It is with such a view that the
   Psalmist, after stating all the other benefits which God bestows, adds
   this as a last clause, that when he has followed them with his fatherly
   goodness throughout their lives, he at last shows them his salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [581] Calvin's reading of this verse is different from that of our
   English Bible. According to it, thou, in the first clause, refers to
   the Psalmist; while, according to him, it is to be understood of God.
   Hammond gives a similar version. "Because thou, O Lord! art my hope;
   thou hast made the Most High thy help or refuge." All the ancient
   versions understand the first clause as spoken of God. In the
   Septuagint it is su Kurie he elpis mou, "thou, O Lord! art my hope."
   Similar is the reading of the Chaldee, the Syriac, and Vulgate. But the
   last member of the verse, "thou hast made the Most High thy refuge," is
   generally referred to the Psalmist, and regarded as a part of a
   soliloquy to which, when alone, his soul gave utterance.

   [582] aspida. The most ancient versions correspond in this respect with
   the Septuagint, as the Vulgate, St Jerome's, Apollinaris', the Syriac,
   Arabic, and Æthiopic versions, rendering schl, shachal, not by the lion
   but by the asp, though they are not agreed as to the particular kind of
   asp which is intended. This opinion is adopted by the learned Bochart,
   (Hieroz. volume 3, lib. 3, cap. 3,) who thinks it probable that
   throughout the verse serpents only are spoken of, and other
   interpreters have concurred in the same view. He thinks schl, shachal,
   rendered "the lion," is the black serpent, or hoemorhous; and kphyr,
   kepher, rendered "young lion," has been supposed to be the cenchris,
   which Nicander (Theriac, 5, 463) calls leon aiolos, the spotted lion,
   because he is speckled, and, like the lion, raises his tail when about
   to fight, and bites and gluts himself with blood. Bochart objects to
   the lion and young lion being meant, on the ground of the incongruity
   of animals of so very different a nature as lions and serpents being
   joined together; and observes, that to walk upon the lion seems not a
   very proper expression, as men do not in walking tread on lions as they
   do on serpents. But the lion and the young lion, the rendering of later
   interpreters, correspond to each other, and preserve the parallelism
   for which the Hebrew poetry is distinguished, and the reasons assigned
   by Bochart for setting it aside seem insufficient. The lion and the
   serpent are formidable animals to contend with; and Satan, one of the
   enemies to be "put in subjection under the feet of Christ," is, in the
   New Testament, compared both to the lion and the dragon, (1 Peter 5:8;
   Revelation 12:9.) "Let it be added," says Merrick, "that the Hebrew
   text says nothing of walking upon the lion, but has the word tdrk,
   which strictly signifies calcabis, thou shalt tread; and as to trample
   on the nations, and to make his enemies his footstool, are expressions
   used to signify the subduing and triumphing over them; to tread on the
   lion and the serpent may be understood in the same sense." Cresswell
   thinks it probable that the language of this verse is proverbial. "The
   course of human life," he remarks, "is in Scripture compared to a
   journey; and the dangers described in this verse were common to the
   wayfaring man in the Psalmist's time and country."

   perpetuas, neque aequali tenore fluere." -- Lat. "Ne sont pas
   perpetuelles, et ne descoulent pas d'un fil continuel." -- Fr.

   [584] "With long life, etc. This was a blessing often pledged to good
   men during the Mosaic dispensation; though we cannot understand it as
   being universally accomplished, because God at that, as at every
   subsequent period, has reserved to himself, and to his own wisdom, the
   times and the seasons.'" -- Walford.

   PSALM 92

   This psalm contains an exhortation to praise God, and shows how much
   ground we have for this exercise from the works of God, insisting,
   especially, upon his justice, displayed in the protection of his
   people, and the destruction of the wicked. By such truth it encourages
   to the practice of righteousness, and preserves us from fainting under
   the cross of Christ, by proposing to our view a happy issue out of all
   our afflictions. To deter us, on the other hand, from the commission of
   iniquity it declares that sinners, however they may prosper for a time,
   will speedily be destroyed.

   A Song for the Sabbath-day.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 92:1-4

   1. It is good to give thanks unto Jehovah, to sing praises unto thy
   name, O Most High! 2. To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning,
   and thy faithfulness in the night, 3. Upon the psaltery, and upon the
   hand instrument, with the song upon the harp. 4. For thou, Jehovah,
   hast made me glad in thy works; I will triumph in the works of thy
   hands.


   1 It is good to give thanks unto Jehovah. There is no reason to doubt
   that the Jews were in the habit of singing this psalm, as the
   inscription bears, upon the Sabbath-day, and it is apparent, from
   different passages, that other psalms were applied to this use. As the
   words may be read literally in the Hebrew, it is good for giving thanks
   unto the Lord, some interpreters, founding upon the letter l, lamed,
   prefixed to the verb, understand the Psalmist to mean that it was good
   to have a certain day set apart for singing the praises of God -- that
   it was a useful arrangement by which one day had been chosen to be
   occupied by the Lord's people in celebrating his works. But it is well
   known that this letter, when prefixed, is merely the ordinary mark of
   the infinitive mood -- and I have given what is obviously the simple
   meaning. The reason why the Psalmist appropriated this psalm to the
   Sabbath is sufficiently obvious. That day is not to be holy, in the
   sense of being devoted to idleness, as if this could be an acceptable
   worship to God, but in the sense of our separating ourselves from all
   other occupations, to engage in meditating upon the Divine works. As
   our minds are inconstant, we are apt, when exposed to various
   distractions, to wander from God. [585] We need to be disentangled from
   all cares if we would seriously apply ourselves to the praises of God.
   The Psalmist then would teach us that the right observance of the
   Sabbath does not consist in idleness, as some absurdly imagine, but in
   the celebration of the Divine name. The argument which he adduces is
   drawn from the profitableness of the service, for nothing is more
   encouraging than to know that our labor is not in vain, and that what
   we engage in meets with the Divine approbation. In the succeeding
   verse, he adverts to the grounds which we have for praising God, that
   we may not imagine that God calls upon us to engage in this service
   without reason, or simply in consideration of his greatness and power,
   but in remembrance of his goodness and faithfulness, which should
   inflame our hearts to such exercise, if we had any proper sense and
   experience of them. He would have us consider, in mentioning these,
   that not only is God worthy of praise, but that we ourselves are
   chargeable with ingratitude and perversity should we refuse it. We are
   the proper objects of his faithfulness and goodness, and it would argue
   inexcusable indifference if they did not elicit our cordial praises. It
   might seem a strange distinction which the Psalmist observes when he
   speaks of our announcing God's goodness in the morning, and his
   faithfulness at night. His goodness is constant, and not peculiar to
   any one season, why then devote but a small part of the day to the
   celebration of it? And the same may be said of the other Divine
   perfection mentioned, for it is not merely in the night that his
   faithfulness is shown. But this is not what the Psalmist intends. He
   means that beginning to praise the Lord from earliest dawn, we should
   continue his praises to the latest hour of the night, this being no
   more than his goodness and faithfulness deserve. [586] If we begin by
   celebrating his goodness, we must next take up the subject of his
   faithfulness. Both will occupy our continued praises, for they stand
   mutually and inseparably connected. The Psalmist is not therefore to be
   supposed as wishing us to separate the one from the other, for they are
   intimately allied; he would only suggest that we can never want matter
   for praising God unless indolence prevail over us, and that if we would
   rightly discharge the office of gratitude, we must be assiduous in it,
   since his goodness and his faithfulness are incessant.

   In the fourth verse, he more immediately addresses the Levites, who
   were appointed to the office of singers, and calls upon them to employ
   their instruments of music -- not as if this were in itself necessary,
   only it was useful as an elementary aid to the people of God in these
   ancient times. [587] We are not to conceive that God enjoined the harp
   as feeling a delight like ourselves in mere melody of sounds; but the
   Jews, who were yet under age, were astricted to the use of such
   childish elements. The intention of them was to stimulate the
   worshippers, and stir them up more actively to the celebration of the
   praise of God with the heart. We are to remember that the worship of
   God was never understood to consist in such outward services, which
   were only necessary to help forward a people, as yet weak and rude in
   knowledge, in the spiritual worship of God. A difference is to be
   observed in this respect between his people under the Old and under the
   New Testament; for now that Christ has appeared, and the Church has
   reached full age, it were only to bury the light of the Gospel, should
   we introduce the shadows of a departed dispensation. From this, it
   appears that the Papists, as I shall have occasion to show elsewhere,
   in employing instrumental music, cannot be said so much to imitate the
   practice of God's ancient people, as to ape it in a senseless and
   absurd manner, exhibiting a silly delight in that worship of the Old
   Testament which was figurative, and terminated with the Gospel. [588]

   4 Because thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad. The Psalmist repeats the
   truth that the Sabbath was not prescribed as a day of idleness, but a
   season when we should collect our whole energies for meditation upon
   the works of God. He intimates, at the same time, that those are best
   qualified for celebrating the praises of God who recognize and feel his
   fatherly goodness, and can undertake this service with willing and
   joyful minds. His language implies that the goodness and faithfulness
   of God, which he had already mentioned, are apparent in his works upon
   a due examination of them. What produces joy in our hearts is the
   exhibition which God gives of himself as a Father, and of his deep and
   watchful anxiety for our welfare; as, on the other hand, the cause of
   our brutish indifference is our inability to savor or relish the end
   designed in the works of God. [589] As the universe proclaims
   throughout that God is faithful and good, it becomes us to be
   diligently observant of these tokens, and to be excited by a holy joy
   to the celebration of his praise.

   [588] But although Calvin held the use of instrumental music in public
   worship to be inconsistent with the genius of the Christian
   dispensation, he regarded the celebration of the praises of God with
   the melody of the human voice as an institution of great solemnity and
   usefulness. He knew that psalm-singing is sanctioned by the apostles,
   and that music has a powerful influence in exciting the mind to ardor
   of devotion; and to him belongs the merit of having, with the advice of
   Luther, formed the plan of establishing, as a principal branch of
   public worship in the Reformed Churches, the singing of psalms,
   translated into the vernacular language, and adapted to plain and easy
   melodies, which all the people might learn, and in which they all might
   join. Immediately upon the publication of Clement Marot's version of
   David's Psalms into French rhymes at Paris, he introduced it into his
   congregation at Geneva, set to plain and popular music; and it soon
   came into universal use throughout the numerous congregations of the
   Reformed Church of France. At length Marot's Psalms formed an appendix
   to the Catechism at Geneva, and became a characteristic mark or badge
   of the Calvinistic worship and profession. Marot's translation, which
   did not aim at any innovation in the public worship, and which he
   dedicated to his master Francis I., and the ladies of France, received
   at first the sanction of the Sorbonne, as containing nothing contrary
   to sound doctrine. But Calvin knew the character of the book better
   than the doctors of the Sorbonne, and having, by his influence,
   obtained its introduction into the worship of the Protestant Church of
   France, it contributed so much, in consequence of its extraordinary
   popularity, to the advancement of the Reformed cause in that country,
   that it was interdicted under the most severe penalties; and, in the
   language of the Romish Church, psalm-singing and heresy became
   synonymous terms. -- Warton's History of English Poetry, volume 3,

   Psalm 92:5-8

   5. O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy works! thy thoughts are very
   deep. 6. The foolish man shall not know them, neither shall the man
   void of wisdom understand them. 7. When the wicked flourish as the
   grass, and all the workers of iniquity spring up, that they may perish
   for ever. 8. And thou, O Jehovah! art exalted for evermore.


   5 O Jehovah! how highly exalted are thy works! The Psalmist, having
   spoken of the works of God in general, proceeds to speak more
   particularly of his justice in the government of the world. Though God
   may postpone the punishment of the wicked, he shows, in due time, that
   in conniving at their sins, he did not overlook or fail to perceive
   them; and though he exercises his own children with the cross, he
   proves in the issue, that he was not indifferent to their welfare. His
   reason for touching upon this particular point seems to be, that much
   darkness is thrown upon the scheme of Divine Providence by the
   inequality and disorder which prevail in human affairs. [590] We see
   the wicked triumphing, and applauding their own good fortune, as if
   there was no judge above, and taking occasion from the Divine
   forbearance to run into additional excesses, under the impression that
   they have escaped his hand. The temptation is aggravated by that
   stupidity and blindness of heart which lead us to imagine that God
   exerts no superintendence over the world, and sits idle in heaven. It
   is known, too, how soon we are ready to sink under the troubles of the
   flesh. The Psalmist, therefore, intentionally selects this as a case in
   which he may show the watchful care exerted by God over the human
   family. He begins, by using the language of exclamation, for such is
   the dreadful distemper and disorder by which our understandings are
   confounded, that we cannot comprehend the method of God's works, even
   when it is most apparent. We are to notice, that the inspired penman is
   not speaking here of the work of God in the creation of the heavens and
   earth, nor of his providential government of the world in general, but
   only of the judgments which he executes amongst men. He calls the works
   of God great, and his thoughts deep, because he governs the world in
   quite another manner than we are able to comprehend. Were things under
   our own management, we would entirely invert the order which God
   observes; and, such not being the case, we perversely expostulate with
   God for not hastening sooner to the help of the righteous, and to the
   punishment of the wicked. It strikes us as in the highest degree
   inconsistent with the perfections of God, that he should bear with the
   wicked when they rage against him, when they rush without restraint
   into the most daring acts of iniquity, and when they persecute at will
   the good and the innocent; -- it seems, I say, in our eyes to be
   intolerable, that God should subject his own people to the injustice
   and violence of the wicked, while he puts no check upon abounding
   falsehood, deceit, rapine, bloodshed, and every species of enormity.
   Why does he suffer his truth to be obscured, and his holy name to be
   trampled under foot? This is that greatness of the Divine operation,
   that depth of the Divine counsel, into the admiration of which the
   Psalmist breaks forth. It is no doubt true, that there is an
   incomprehensible depth of power and wisdom which God has displayed in
   the fabric of the universe; but what the Psalmist has specially in view
   is, to administer a check to that disposition which leads us to murmur
   against God, when he does not pursue our plan in his providential
   managements. When anything in these may not agree with the general
   ideas of men, we ought to contemplate it with reverence, and remember
   that God, for the better trial of our obedience, has lifted his deep
   and mysterious judgments far above our conceptions.

   6 The foolish man shall not know them. This is added with propriety, to
   let us know that the fault lies with ourselves, in not praising the
   Divine judgments as we ought. For although the Psalmist had spoken of
   them as deep and mysterious, he here informs us that they would be
   discerned without difficulty, were it not for our stupidity and
   indifference. By the foolish, he means unbelievers in general, tacitly
   contrasting them with believers who are divinely enlightened by the
   word and Spirit. The ignorance and blindness to which he alludes have
   possession of all without exception, whose understandings have not been
   illuminated by Divine grace. It ought to be our prayer to God, that he
   would purge our sight, and qualify us for meditation upon his works. In
   short, the Psalmist vindicates the incomprehensible wisdom of God from
   that contempt which proud men have often cast upon it, charging them
   with folly and madness in acting such a part; and he would arouse us
   from that insensibility which is too prevalent, to a due and serious
   consideration of the mysterious works of God.

   7 When the wicked flourish as the grass. He points out, and exposes, by
   a striking and appropriate figure, the folly of imagining that the
   wicked obtain a triumph over God, when he does not, it may be,
   immediately bring them under restraint. He makes an admission so far --
   he grants that they spring up and flourish -- but adds immediately, by
   way of qualification, that they flourish, like the grass, only for a
   moment, their prosperity being brief and evanescent. In this way he
   removes what has been almost a universal stumbling-block and ground of
   offense; for it would be ridiculous to envy the happiness of men who
   are doomed to be speedily destroyed, and of whom it may be said, that
   to-day they flourish, and to-morrow they are cut down and wither,
   (Psalm 129:6.) It will be shown, when we come to consider the psalm now
   quoted, that the herbs to which the wicked are compared are such as
   grow on the roofs of houses, which want depth of soil, and die of
   themselves, for lack of nourishment. In the passage now before us, the
   Psalmist satisfies himself with using simply the figure, that the
   prosperity of the wicked draws after it the speedier destruction, as
   the grass when it is full grown is ready for the scythe. There is an
   antithesis drawn, too, between the shortness of their continuance and
   the everlasting destruction which awaits them; for they are not said to
   be cut down that they may flourish again, as withered plants will
   recover their vigor, but to be condemned to eternal perdition. [591]
   When he says of God, that he sits exalted for evermore, some understand
   him to mean, that God holds the power and office of governing the
   world, and that we may be certain nothing can happen by chance when
   such a righteous governor and judge administers the affairs of the
   world. Various other meanings have been suggested. But it seems to me
   that the Psalmist compares the stability of God's throne with the
   fluctuating and changeable character of this world, reminding us that
   we must not judge of Him by what we see in the world, where there is
   nothing of a fixed and enduring nature. God looks down undisturbed from
   the altitude of heaven upon all the changes of this earthly scene,
   which neither affect nor have any relation to him. And this the
   Psalmist brings forward with another view than simply to teach us to
   distinguish God from his creatures, and put due honor upon his majesty;
   he would have us learn in our contemplations upon the wonderful and
   mysterious providence of God, to lift our conceptions above ourselves
   and this world, since it is only a dark and confused view which our
   earthly minds can take up. It is with the purpose of leading us into a
   proper discovery of the Divine judgments which are not seen in the
   world, that the Psalmist, in making mention of the majesty of God,
   would remind us, that he does not work according to our ideas, but in a
   manner corresponding to his own eternal being. We, short-lived
   creatures as we are, often thwarted in our attempts, embarrassed and
   interrupted by many intervening difficulties, and too glad to embrace
   the first opportunity which offers, are accustomed to advance with
   precipitation; but we are taught here to lift our eyes unto that
   eternal and unchangeable throne on which God sits, and in wisdom defers
   the execution of his judgments. The words accordingly convey more than
   a simple commendation of the glorious being of God; they are meant to
   help our faith, and tell us that, although his people may sigh under
   many an anxious apprehension, God himself, the guardian of their
   safety, reigns on high, and shields them with his everlasting power.

   Psalm 92:9-11

   9. For, lo! thine enemies, O Jehovah! for, lo, thine enemies shall
   perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. [592] 10. But
   my horn shalt thou exalt, like the horn of an unicorn: [593] I have
   been profusely anointed with fresh oil. [594] 11. And mine eyes shall
   see it on mine enemies: mine ears shall hear it upon those who rise up
   against me, upon those who persecute me.


   9 For, lo! thine enemies, O Jehovah! From what was already said in the
   verse preceding, the Psalmist concludes it to be impossible that God
   should not overthrow his enemies. This, as I have already observed,
   clearly shows that it was his design to establish our faith under the
   strong temptations to which it is subjected, and, more especially, to
   remove that offense out of the way, which has disturbed the minds of
   many, and led them astray; -- we refer to the prosperity of the wicked,
   and its effect in attaching a certain perplexity to the judgments of
   God. As our faith is never called to a more sharp and arduous trial
   than upon this point, the Psalmist delivers the truth, which he
   announces with much force of expression, using both exclamations and
   repetition. First, he declares the destruction of God's enemies to be
   as certain as if it had already taken place, and he had witnessed it
   with his own eyes; then he repeats his assertion: and from all this we
   may see how much he had benefited by glancing with the eye of faith
   beyond this world to the throne of God in the heavens. When staggered
   in our own faith at any time by the prosperity of the wicked, we should
   learn by his example to rise in our contemplations to a God in heaven,
   and the conviction will immediately follow in our minds that his
   enemies cannot long continue to triumph. The Psalmist tells us who they
   are that are God's enemies. God hates none without a cause; nay, so far
   as men are the workmanship of his hand, he embraces them in his
   fatherly love. But as nothing is more opposed to his nature than sin,
   he proclaims irreconcilable war with the wicked. It contributes in no
   small degree to the comfort of the Lord's people, to know that the
   reason why the wicked are destroyed is, their being necessarily the
   objects of God's hatred, so that he can no more fail to punish them
   than deny himself. [595]

   The Psalmist, shortly afterwards, shows that he intended this to be a
   ground of comfort and hope under all cares, griefs, anxieties, and
   embarrassments. He speaks under the figure of oil of enjoying Divine
   blessings, and by green or fresh oil is meant, such as has not become
   corrupted, or unfit for use by age. It is noticeable that he
   appropriates, and improves for his own individual comfort, that grace
   of God which is extended to all the Lord's people without exception;
   and would teach us by this that mere general doctrine is a cold and
   unsatisfactory thing, and that each of us should improve it
   particularly for himself, in the persuasion of our belonging to the
   number of God's children. In one word, the Psalmist promises himself
   the protection of God, under whatever persecutions he should endure
   from his enemies, whether they were secret, or more open and violent,
   that he may encourage himself to persevere with indefatigable spirit in
   the world's conflict. We may judge from this how absurd is the opinion
   of the Rabbin, who conjectured that Adam was the author of this psalm
   [596] -- as if it were credible that his posterity should have set
   themselves up in rebellion against him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [592] Hammond reads "separated," and supposes that this may be a
   judicial phrase, denoting the discrimination made betwixt men, as that
   which will be effected betwixt the sheep and the goats at the last day.
   Matthew 25:32 -- "All the nations shall be gathered together or
   assembled before him" as a judge, "and, aphoriei autous ap' allelon, he
   shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd, aphorizei,
   separates the sheep from the goats." For this interpretation we have
   the authority of the Chaldee, which paraphrases the clause thus, "In
   the world to come the workers of iniquity shall be separated from the
   congregation of the just." If this sense is admitted, the passage
   corresponds with these words in the fifth verse of the first psalm,
   "The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the
   congregation of the righteous." The LXX., however, render the original
   word, ytphrdv, yithparedu, by diaskorpisthesontai, "shall be
   scattered;" and the Syriac gives a similar version. Thus it may denote
   the scattering of enemies, which have been vanquished in battle and put
   to flight.

   [593] The horn is worn over all the East, and is the symbol of strength
   and power. It adorns the heads of all princely personages in Oriental
   mythology. Large horns, representing the glory of deity, are planted on
   the heads of their idols, or placed in their hands. The horn is
   therefore frequently employed in Scripture as the emblem of power and
   authority; and when the Psalmist affirms that God would exalt his horn,
   it expresses his assurance of victory over his enemies. As to the
   animal meant by "the unicorn," great variety of interpretations has
   obtained both among ancient and modern critics. The most probable
   opinion is that of Bochart, who, supporting himself by numerous
   quotations from Arabian and other Eastern writers, concludes that the
   r'm, reem, of Scripture, is a species of wild goat of a snow-white
   color, having long and sharp horns, and distinguished by carrying their
   heads very high.

   [594] "The verb in the Hebrew expresses much more than a superficial
   unction, viz., a penetration of the whole substance of the man's person
   by the oil. See Parkhurst's Lexicon, under vl: -- fresh oil; rather
   invigorating oil." -- Horsley The original word for fresh signifies
   green But, as Harmer observes, "We are not to suppose the Psalmist
   means oil of a green color. We are to understand the word as signifying
   precious, fragrant oil, such as princes in times of prosperity were
   anointed with." -- Harmer's Observations, volume 3, page 257.

   [595] "Qu'il faut necessairement qu'ils soyent hays de Dieu, lequel ne
   se peut renoncer soy mesme."

   [596] These Rabbins say that Adam composed it immediately after the
   creation before the Sabbath. The Chaldee paraphrase entitles the psalm,
   "A hymn or song which the first man spoke concerning the Sabbath-day."
   But had it been a composition of Adam's, one would think it should have
   been placed at the head of this collection of psalms. Besides, there
   were no musical instruments at that time for this psalm to be sung
   upon, (see verse 3;) for Tubal was the father of them that handle the
   harp and organ; nor, as Calvin observes, had Adam numerous enemies and
   wicked men who rose up against him, to which reference is made in
   verses 7, 9, 11. We may therefore justly regard the Jewish tradition,
   which ascribes the composition of this psalm to Adam, as fabulous,
   having no other foundation but the invention and fancy of some of their
   Rabbins.

   Psalm 92:12-13

   12. The righteous shalt flourish like the palm-tree, [597] he shall be
   multiplied as the cedar in Lebanon. [598] 13. Those who are planted in
   the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God. 14. They
   shall still bud forth in old age; they shall be fat and green; 15. That
   they may show that Jehovah is upright, my rock, and that there is no
   iniquity in him.


   12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree. He now passes to
   the consideration of another general truth, That though God may
   exercise his people with many trials, subject them to hardships, and
   visit them with privations, he will eventually show that he had not
   forgotten them. We need not be surprised that he insists so explicitly
   and carefully upon this point, as nothing is more difficult than for
   the saints of God to entertain expectations of being raised up and
   delivered when they have been reduced almost to the state of the dead,
   and it does not appear how they can live. Some think the cedar is
   mentioned from the fragrancy of its smell, and the palm for the
   sweetness of its fruit; but this is too subtile a meaning to attach to
   the words. The sense seems simply, that though the righteous may appear
   for a time to be withered, or to have been cut down, they will again
   spring up with renewed vigor, and flourish as well and as fair in the
   Church of God as the stateliest trees upon Lebanon. The expression
   which is employed -- planted in the house of the Lord -- gives the
   reason of their vigorous growth; nor is it meant that they have merely
   a place there, (which can be said even of hypocrites,) but that they
   are firmly fixed, and deeply rooted in it, so as to be united to God.
   The Psalmist speaks of the courts of the Lord, because none but the
   priests were allowed to enter the holy place; the people worshipped in
   the court. By those who are planted in the Church he means such as are
   united to God in real and sincere attachment, and insinuates that their
   prosperity cannot be of a changeable and fluctuating nature, because it
   is not founded upon anything that is in the world. Nor indeed can we
   doubt that whatever has its root, and is founded in the sanctuary, must
   continue to flourish and partake of a life which is spiritual and
   everlasting. It is in this sense that he speaks of their still budding
   forth, and being fat, even in old age, when the natural sap and juices
   are generally dried up. The language amounts to saying that they are
   exempt from the ordinary lot of men, and have a life which is taken
   from under the common law of nature. [599] It is thus that Jacob,
   speaking of the great renovation which should take place in the Church,
   mentions, that at that happy period he who was an hundred years old
   should be a child, meaning that, though old age naturally tends to
   death, and one who has lived a hundred years is upon the very borders
   of it, yet in the kingdom of Christ; a man would be reckoned as being
   merely in his childhood, and starting in life, who entered upon a new
   century. This could only be verified in the sense, that after death we
   have another existence in heaven.

   15. That they may show that Jehovah is upright. It is evident from this
   verse that the great object of the Psalmist is, to allay that
   disquietude of mind which we are apt to feel under the disorder which
   reigns apparently in the affairs of this world; and to make us cherish
   the expectation, (under all that may seem severe and trying in our lot,
   and though the wicked are in wealth and power, flourish, and abound in
   places and distinctions,) that God will bring light and order
   eventually out of confusion. That they may show, it is said
   particularly, that the Lord is upright; for through the influence of
   our corruption we are apt to conclude, when things do not proceed as we
   would wish in the world, that God is chargeable not only with neglect
   but with unrighteousness, in abandoning his people, and tolerating the
   commission of sin. When God displays his justice in proceeding to
   execute vengeance upon the wicked, it will be seen at once, that any
   prosperity which they enjoyed was but the forerunner of a worse
   destruction in reserve for them. The Psalmist, in calling God his rock,
   shows a second time that he reckoned himself amongst the number of
   those in whom God would illustrate his justice by extending towards
   them his protection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [597] The palm is one of the noblest and most beautiful of trees. It is
   more remarkable than any other tree for its straight, upright growth,
   and hence its Hebrew name tmr tamar It frequently rises to the height
   of more than a hundred feet; and its leaves, when it arrives at
   maturity, are often six or eight feet in length, and broad in
   proportion. At the age of thirty it attains its greatest vigor, and
   continues in full strength and beauty for seventy years longer,
   producing every year about three or four hundred weight of dates. It is
   crowned at the top with a large tuft of spiralling leaves about four
   feet long, which never fall off, but always continue in the same
   flourishing verdure. And it has been said that when loaded with any
   weight it possesses the quality of resisting it, and of rising upwards
   and bending the contrary way, to counterbalance the pressure. This
   tree, then, so distinguished for its uprightness, loftiness, fecundity,
   longevity, perpetual verdure, and power of resistance, is employed with
   great elegance to express the spiritual beauty, elevation,
   fruitfulness, constancy, patience, and victory of the righteous.

   [598] The cedars of Lebanon are a favourite image with the sacred
   writers. They grow to a prodigious size, rise to an enormous height,
   and spread their branches to a great extent, affording a grateful
   shade. They continue to flourish for more than a thousand years; and,
   when cut down, their wood is so durable that it has obtained the
   reputation of being incorruptible. How striking, then, the image, "The
   righteous shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon," like that massy, lofty,
   umbrageous, and incorruptible tree, which continues to flourish from
   generation to generation, which survives empires, and is still vigorous
   when a thousand years have passed over it.

   [599] "They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. Being thus
   planted and watered, they shall not only bring forth the fruits of
   righteousness, but shall continue and go on to do so, and even when
   they are grown old; contrary to all other trees, which, when old, cease
   bearing fruit; but so do not the righteous; grace is often in the
   greatest vigor when nature is decayed; witness Abraham, Job, David,
   Zechariah, and Elisabeth, and good old Simeon, who went to the grave
   like shocks of corn fully ripe." -- Dr Gill.
