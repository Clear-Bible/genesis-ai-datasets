The Beginning of Months

   (No. 1637)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 1, 1882.

   "And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
   this month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the
   first month of the year to you." Exodus 12:1,2.

   In all probability up to that time the year had been supposed to begin
   in the autumn. The question has been raised at what season of the year
   did God create man and it has been decided by many that it must have
   been in autumn, so that when Adam was placed in the garden he might at
   once find fruits ripe and ready for his use. It has not seemed probable
   that he would have begun his career while as yet all fruits were raw
   and green--therefore many have concluded that the first year of human
   history began in the time of harvest--when fruits were mellowed for
   man's food. For this reason, perhaps, in the old times the new year
   began when the feast of harvest had been celebrated.

   Here, at the point of the Exodus, by a decree of God, the commencement
   of the year was altered and, so far as Israel was concerned, the
   opening of the year was fixed for the time of our spring--in the month
   called Abib, or Nisan. We know that a little before the barley was in
   the ear, (see Exodus 9:31), and on the Sabbath after the Passover, the
   produce of the earth was so far advanced that the first fruits were
   offered and a sheaf of new barley was waved before the Lord. Of course,
   when I speak of spring and then of ears of barley, you must remember
   the difference of climate, for in that warm region the seasons are far
   in advance of ours.

   You must pardon me if my ideas should become a little mixed--you can
   correct them easily at your leisure. From the time when the Lord saved
   His people from destruction by passing over them, the ecclesiastical
   year began in the month of Abib, in which the Passover was celebrated.
   The Jubilee Year was not altered, but began in the autumnal equinox.
   The Jews seem to have had two or three beginnings of the year in
   relation to different purposes, but the ecclesiastical year, the great
   year by which Israel reckoned its existence, commenced, from then on,
   in the month Abib, when the Lord brought His people out with a high
   hand and an outstretched arm.

   It is with God to change times and seasons as He pleases and He has
   done so for great commemorative purposes. The change of the Sabbath is
   on the same manner, for whereas the day of rest was formerly the
   seventh, it is now merged in the Lord's Day, which is the first day of
   the week. As Herbert says, "He did unhinge the day," and He set the
   Sabbath on golden hinges by consecrating the day of His Resurrection.
   To every man God makes such a change of times and seasons when He deals
   with him in a way of Grace, for all things are become new within him
   and, therefore, he begins a new chronology. Some of us used to think
   our birthday fell at a certain time of the year, but now we regard with
   much more delight another day as our true birthday, since on that
   second natal day we began truly to live! Our calendar has been altered
   and amended by a deed of divine Grace!

   This morning I want to bring to your mind the fact that, just as the
   people of Israel, when God gave them the Passover, had a complete
   shifting and changing of all their dates and began their year on quite
   a different day, so when God gives to His people to eat the spiritual
   Passover, there takes place in their chronology a very wonderful
   change. Saved men and women date from the dawn of their true life--not
   from their first birthday--but from the day wherein they were born
   again of the Spirit of God--and entered into the knowledge and
   enjoyment of spiritual things.

   The Passover is, as we all know, a type of the great work of our
   redemption by the blood of Jesus, and it represents the personal
   application of it to each Believer. When we perceive the Lord's act of
   passing over us because of Christ's atoning Sacrifice, then it is that
   we begin to live and from that day we date all future events. So this
   morning we shall first describe the event. Secondly, mention varieties
   of its recurrence and thirdly, consider in what light the day of this
   grand event is to be regarded according to the Law of the Lord.

   I. First, then, let us describe this remarkable event which was to
   stand at the head of the Jewish year and, indeed, at the commencement
   of all Israelite chronology. First, this event was an act of salvation
   by blood. You know how the elders and heads of families, each one, took
   the lamb and shut it up, that they might examine it carefully. Having
   chosen a

   lamb without blemish, in the prime of its life, they kept it by itself
   as a separated and consecrated creature. And after four days they slew
   it and caught its blood in a basin. When this was done, they took
   hyssop, dipped it in the blood, and sprinkled the lintel and the two
   side posts of their houses with it.

   By this means the houses of Israel were preserved on that dark and
   dreadful night when, with unsheathed sword, the Angel of Vengeance sped
   through every street of Pharaoh's domain and slew the first-born of all
   the land, both of men and of cattle. You will remember, dear Friends,
   the time when you, yourselves, perceived that God's vengeance was out
   against sin. You can even now remember your terror and your trembling!
   Many of us can never forget the memorable time when we first discovered
   that there was a way of deliverance from the wrath of God. Memory may
   drop all else from her enfeebled grasp, but this is engraved on the
   palms of her hands!

   The mode of our deliverance is before us in the type as Moses describes
   it. The angel could not be restrained; his wings could not be bound and
   his sword could not be sheathed--he must go forth and he must kill. He
   must kill us among the rest, for sin was upon us and there must be no
   partiality--"the soul that sins, it shall die." But do you remember
   when you discovered God's new way--His blessed ordinance by which,
   without abrogating the destroying Law--He brought in a glorious saving
   clause by which we were delivered? The clause was this--that if another
   could be found who could and would suffer instead of us and, if there
   could be clear evidence that this surety did so suffer--then the sight
   of that evidence should be enough for our deliverance.

   Do you remember your joy at that discovery? For, if so, you can enter
   into the feelings of the Israelites when they understood that God would
   accept an unblemished lamb in the place of their first-born! And if the
   blood was displayed upon the door post as the clear evidence that a
   sacrifice had died and a substitute had suffered, then the angel would
   know that in that house his work was done--and he might, therefore,
   pass over that habitation. The avenger was to demand a life, but the
   life was already paid, for there was the blood-mark which proved it and
   the exactor might go on his way! It was the night of God's Passover,
   not because the execution of vengeance was left undone in the houses
   passed over, but for a reason of the opposite kind--because in those
   houses the death-blow had been struck, the victim had died--and, as the
   penalty could not be exacted twice, that family was clear!

   I do not know whether there is any truth in the statement of a
   correspondent that whatever part of the earth the lightning once
   strikes, it never strikes it again. But whether it is so or not, it is
   certain that wherever the lightning of God's vengeance has once struck
   the sinner's Substitute, it will not strike the sinner! The best
   preservative for the Israelite's house was this--vengeance had struck
   there and could not strike again! There was the insurance mark, the
   blood-streak! Death had been there, no matter though it had fallen on a
   harmless lamb--it had fallen on a victim of God's own appointment--and
   in His esteem it had fallen upon His Christ, the Lamb slain from before
   the foundation of the world!

   Because the claims of retribution had been fully met there was no
   further demand and Israel was secure. This is my eternal confidence and
   here is my soul's sweet hymn--

   " If You have my discharge procured,

   And freely in my place endured

   The whole of wrath Divine--

   Payment God cannot twice demand,

   First at my bleeding Surety's hands

   And then, again, at mine!

   Turn then, my Soul, unto your rest

   The merits of your great High Priest

   Have bought your liberty--

   Trust in His efficacious blood,

   Nor fear your banishment from God,

   Since Jesus died for thee."

   It was to me the beginning of my life, that day in which I discovered
   that judgment was passed upon me in the Person of my Lord and that
   there is, therefore, now no condemnation to me! The Law demands
   death--"The soul that sins, it shall die." Lo, there is the death it
   asks and more! Christ, my Lord, has died, died in my place--as it is
   written, "Who His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree."
   Such a Sacrifice is more than even the most rigorous law could demand!

   "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us." "Christ has redeemed us
   from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us." Therefore do we
   sit securely within doors, desiring no guard outside to drive away the
   Destroyer, for, when God sees the blood of Jesus, He will pass over us!
   "In His days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely: and
   this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR
   RIGHTEOUSNESS" (Jer. 23:6). I say again, it was the beginning of life
   to me when I saw Jesus as dying in my place! I beheld the first sight
   that was worth beholding, let all the rest be darkness and as the
   shadow of death! Then did my soul rejoice when I understood and
   accepted the substitutionary Sacrifice of the appointed Redeemer. That
   is the first view of this event--the blood of sprinkling made Israel
   secure.

   Secondly, that night they received refreshment from the lamb. Being
   saved by its blood, the believing households sat down and fed upon the
   lamb. They never ate as they ate that night! Those who spiritually
   understood the symbol must have partaken of every morsel with a
   mysterious awe mingled with an unfathomable delight. I am sure there
   must have been a singular seriousness about the table as they stood
   there eating in haste--and especially if, every now and then, they were
   startled with the shrieks that rose from every house in the land of
   Egypt because of the slain of the Lord. It was a solemn feast, a meal
   of mingled hope and mystery.

   Do you remember, Brothers and Sisters, when first you fed upon Christ?
   When your hungry spirit enjoyed the first morsel of that food of the
   soul? It was dainty fare, was it not? It was better than angels' bread,
   for--

   "Never did angels taste above Redeeming Grace and dying love!"

   I hope you have never risen from that table, but are daily feeding upon
   Jesus. It is a very instructive fact that we do not go to our Lord's
   Table, like Israel, to eat in haste, with a staff in our hand. We come
   there to recline at ease with our heads on His bosom, reposing in His
   love! Christ Jesus is the daily Bread of our spirits. Observe that the
   refreshment which Israel ate that night was the lamb "roasted with
   fire." The best refreshment to a troubled heart is the suffering
   Savior--the Lamb roasted with fire.

   A poor sinner, under a sense of sin, goes to a place of worship and he
   hears Christ preached as an example. This may be useful to the saint,
   but it is scant help to the poor sinner! He cries, "That is true. But
   it rather condemns than comforts me." It is not food for him--he needs
   the lamb roasted with fire--Christ, his Substitute, Christ suffering in
   his place! We hear a great deal about the beauty of Christ's moral
   Character and, assuredly, our blessed Lord deserves to be highly
   exalted on that score. But that is not the aspect under which He is
   food to a soul conscious of sin! The chief relish about our Lord Jesus
   to a penitent sinner is His sin-bearing and His agonies in that
   capacity.

   We need the suffering Savior, the Christ of Gethsemane, the Christ of
   Golgotha and Calvary! Christ shedding His blood in the sinner's place
   and bearing for us the fire of God's wrath! Nothing short of this will
   suffice to be meat for a hungry heart. Keep this back and you starve
   the child of God. We are told in the chapter that they were not to eat
   the lamb raw. Alas, there are some who try to do this with Christ, for
   they preach a half-atoning Sacrifice! They would make Him in His Person
   and in His Character to be meat for their souls, but they have small
   liking for His Passion! And they cast His Atonement into the
   background, or represent it to be an ineffectual expiation which does
   not secure any soul from vengeance. What is this but to devour a raw
   Christ?

   I will not touch their half-roasted lamb! I will have nothing to do
   with their half Substitution, their half-complete Redemption. No, no,
   give me a Savior who has borne all my sins in His body and so has been
   roasted with fire to the fullest! "It is finished," is the most
   charming note in all Calvary's music! "It is finished," the fire has
   passed upon the Lamb! He has borne the whole of the wrath that was due
   to His people--this is the royal dish of the feast of love! What a
   multitude of teachers there are who must necessarily have the Lamb
   boiled with water, though the Scripture says, "Do not eat it raw, nor
   boiled at all with water."

   I have heard it said that a great number of sermons are about Christ
   and about the Gospel, but yet neither Christ nor His Gospel are
   preached in them! If so, the preachers present the lamb boiled in the
   water of their own thoughts and speculations and notions. Now, the
   mischief of this boiling process is that the water takes away a good
   deal from the meat. Philosophical discourses upon the Lord Jesus take
   away much of the essence and virtue of His Person, offices, work and
   Glory. The real juice and vital nutriment of His glorious Word is
   carried off by interpretations which do not explain, but explain away!

   How many boil out the soul of the Gospel by their carnal wisdom! What
   is worse, still, when meat is boiled, it is not only that the meat gets
   into the water, but the water gets into the meat--and so, what Truth of
   God these Gospel-boilers do hand out to us is boiled with error and you
   receive from them dishes made up partly of God's Truth and partly of
   men's imaginations! We hear in some measure solid Gospel, but in larger
   measure mere watery reasoning! When certain divines preach the
   Atonement, it is not Substitution pure and simple--one hardly knows
   what it is! Their atonement is not the vicarious Sacrifice, but a
   performance of something they are long in defining!

   They have a theory which is like the relics of meat after months of
   boiling, all strings and fibers. All manner of schemes are tried to
   extract the marrow and fatness from the grand soul-satisfying doctrine
   of Substitution, which, to my mind, is the choicest Truth of God that
   can ever be brought forth for the food of souls. I cannot make out why
   so many divines are afraid of the shedding of blood for the remission
   of sin and must stew down the most important of all the Truths of
   Revelation!

   No, no! As the type could only be correct when the lamb was roasted
   with fire, so the Gospel is not truly set forth unless we describe our
   Lord Jesus in His sufferings for His people and those sufferings in the
   place of sinners, presenting absolutely and literally a substitution
   for them. I will have no dilution--it is substitution--"He bore our
   sins." He was made sin for us. "The chastisement of our peace was upon
   Him and by His stripes we are healed." We must have no mystifying of
   this plain Truth of God--it must not be "boiled at all with water," but
   we must have Christ in His sufferings fresh from the fire.

   Now, this lamb they were to eat, and the whole of it. Not a morsel must
   be left. Oh that you and I would never cut and divide Christ so as to
   choose one part of Him and leave another! Let not a bone of Him be
   broken, but let us take in a whole Christ up to the full measure of our
   capacity. Prophet, Priest and King--Christ Divine and Christ human,
   Christ loving and living, Christ dying, Christ risen, Christ ascended,
   Christ coming again, Christ triumphant over all His foes--the whole
   Lord Jesus Christ is ours! We must not reject a single particle of what
   is revealed concerning Him, but must feed upon it all as we are able.

   That night Israel had to feed upon the lamb then and there. They might
   not put by a portion for tomorrow. They must consume the whole in some
   way or other. Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, we need a whole Christ at
   this very moment! Let us receive Him in His entirety. Oh for a splendid
   appetite and fine powers of digestion so as to receive into my inmost
   soul the Lord's Christ just as I find Him! May you and I never think
   lightly of our Lord under any light or in any one of His offices. All
   that you now know and all that you can find out concerning Christ you
   should now believe, appreciate, feed upon and rejoice in. Make the most
   of all that is in the Word concerning your Lord. Let Him enter into
   your being to become part and parcel of yourself.

   If you do this, the day in which you feed on Jesus will be the first
   day of your life, its day of days, the day from which you date all that
   follows! If once you have fed upon Christ Jesus, you will never forget
   it in time or in eternity! That was the second event which was
   celebrated in each succeeding Passover. The third event was the
   purification of their houses from leaven, for that was to go in a most
   important way, side by side, with the sprinkling of the blood and the
   eating of the lamb. They were told that they must not eat leaven for
   seven days, for whoever did partake of leaven should be cut off from
   Israel. It shows the deep importance of this purification, that it is
   put in equal position with the sprinkling of the blood. At any rate, it
   might not be separated from it upon pain and penalty that he who
   divided the two should, himself, be divided from the congregation of
   Israel.

   Now, it is always a pity when we are preaching Justification by Faith,
   to bring in sanctification as to make it a part of justification--but
   it is also a horrible error when you are preaching justification, to
   preach it as to deny the absolute necessity of sanctification--for the
   two are joined together by the Lord. There must be eating of the lamb
   as well as the sprinkling of the blood. And there must be the purging
   out of the old leaven, as well as the sprinkling of the blood and the
   eating of the lamb. Very carefully, the Jewish householder looked into
   every closet, corner, drawer and cupboard to sweep out every crumb of
   stale bread--and if they had any bread in storage, even if it was new
   and they intended to eat it, they must throw it all away--for there
   must not be a particle of leaven in the same house with the lamb.

   When you and I first came to Christ, what a sweep there was of the
   leaven! I know I was clean delivered from the leaven of the Pharisees,
   for all trust in my own good works went, even the last crumb of it. All
   confidence in rites and ceremonies must go, too. I have not a crust
   left of either of these two sour and corrupt confidences at the present
   mo-

   ment--and I wish never to taste that old leaven again! Some are always
   chewing at that leaven, glorying in their own prayers, alms and
   ceremonies. But when Christ comes in, this leaven all goes out.

   Moreover, the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy, must be
   cleared out. "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin
   is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity,
   and in whose spirit there is no guile." Guile must go, or guilt will
   not go. The Lord sweeps the cunning out of His people, the craftiness,
   the deceit--He makes them true before His face. They wish that they
   were as clear of every sin as they are clear from insincerity. They
   once tried to dwell before the Lord with double dealing, pretending to
   be what they were not, but as soon as they ate of Christ and the blood
   was sprinkled, then they humbled themselves in truth, laid bare their
   sinnership and stood before God as they were--with their hypocrisy torn
   away. Christ has not saved the man who still trusts in falsehood. You
   cannot feed on Christ and at the same time hold a lie in your right
   hand by vain confidence in yourself, or by love of sin. Self and sin
   must go! But oh, what a day it is when the old leaven is put out--we
   shall never forget it! This month is the beginning of months, the first
   month of the year to us, when the Spirit of Truth purges out the spirit
   of falsehood.

   A fourth point in the Passover is not to be forgotten. On the Passover
   night there came, as the result of the former things, a wonderful,
   glorious and mighty deliverance! That night every Israelite received
   promise of immediate emancipation and, as soon as the morning dawned,
   he left the house in which he had sheltered during the night and
   leaving his home, he left Egypt, too. He left forever the brick kilns!
   He washed the brick-earth for the last time from his hands, looked down
   on the yoke he used to carry when he worked amid the clay, and said, "I
   have done with you." He looked at every Egyptian taskmaster, remembered
   how often he had been struck with the stick, and he rejoiced that he
   would never be struck again, for there he was, at his feet, begging him
   to be gone lest all Egypt should die!

   Oh what joy! They marched out with their unleavened bread still on
   their backs, for they had some days in which they were still to eat it
   and I think before the seventh day of unleavened bread was over they
   had reached the Red Sea. Still eating unleavened bread they went down
   into the depths of the Red Sea. And still with no flavor of leaven in
   their mouths, they stood on its shore to sing unto the Lord the great
   Hallelujah because He had triumphed gloriously and the horse and his
   rider had been cast into the sea! Do you remember when the Lord purged
   you from the love of sin, from trust in self and when He brought you
   clean out and set you free and said, "Go on to the promised rest. Go on
   to Canaan"?

   Do you remember when you saw your sins drowned forever, never to rise
   in judgment against you--not merely your destruction prevented, not
   merely your soul fed with the finest food, not merely your heart and
   your house cleansed of hypocrisy--but yourself delivered and
   emancipated, the Lord's free man? Oh, if so, I am sure you will grant
   the wisdom of the ordinance by which the Lord decreed--"this month
   shall be unto you the beginning of months, it shall be the first month
   of the year to you." Thus much, then, on describing the event.

   II. Now, secondly, I want to mention the varieties of its recurrence
   among us at this day. The first recurrence is, of course, on the
   personal salvation of each one of us. The whole of this chapter was
   transacted in your heart and mine when we first knew the Lord. Our
   venerable Brother and Elder White, when I saw him the other night, said
   to me, "Oh, Sir, it is very precious to read the Bible, but it is
   infinitely more delightful to have it here in your own heart." Now, I
   find it very profitable to read about the Passover, but oh, how sweet
   to have a Passover transacted in your own soul by the work of the Holy
   Spirit!

   Moses wrote of something that happened thousands of years ago, but the
   substance of it all has happened to me and to thousands who are
   trusting in the Lord in all its details! Can we not read this story in
   Exodus and say, "Yes, it is even so"? Every word of it is true, for it
   has all occurred to me, every atom of it, even to the eating of the
   bitter herbs, for I recollect right well that at the very moment when I
   had the sweet flavor of my Lord's Atonement in my mouth, I felt the
   bitterness of repentance on account of sin and the bitterness of
   struggling against the temptation to sin again! Even the minute touches
   of that typical festival are all correct, as thousands know who have
   participated in its antitype. This Passover record is not a story of
   olden times, alone--it is the record of your life and mine--I hope it
   is. Thus by each separate saved man, the paschal feast is kept.

   But then, it happens again in a certain sense when the man's house is
   saved. Remember, this was a family business. The father and mother were
   present when the lamb was slain. I dare say the eldest son helped to
   bring the lamb to the slaughter; another held the knife; a third held
   the basin and the little boy fetched the bunch of hyssop. And so they
   all

   united in the sacrifice. They all saw father strike the lintel and the
   side posts. And they all ate of the lamb that night. Everyone that was
   in the house--all that were really part of the family partook of the
   meal--they were all protected by the blood! They were all refreshed by
   the feast and they all started the next morning to go to Canaan.

   Did you ever hold a family supper of that kind? "Oh," some fathers
   might say, "it would be the beginning of family life to me if I might
   eat bread in the Kingdom of God with all my sons and daughters! Oh that
   every chick and child around my table truly belonged to Christ." A
   family begins to live in the highest sense when, as a family, without
   exception, it has all been redeemed, all sprinkled with the blood, all
   made to feed on Jesus, all purged from sin and all set at liberty to go
   out of the domains of sin, bound for the Kingdom. Joy! Joy! Joy! "I
   have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the Truth of
   God."

   If any of you enjoy the privilege of family salvation, you may well set
   up a monument of praise and make a generous offering to God, by whom
   you are thus favored. Engrave it upon marble and set it up
   forever--"This household is saved and the day of its salvation is the
   beginning of its history in connection with the Lord's Israel." Extend
   the thought--it was not only a family ordinance but it was for all the
   tribes of Israel! There were many families, but in every house the
   Passover was sacrificed. Would it not be a grand thing if you that
   employ large numbers of men should ever be able to gather all together
   and hopefully say, "I trust that all these understand the sprinkling of
   the blood and all feed upon

   Christ"?

   Dear men and women that are placed in such responsible positions, you
   might, indeed, say, "This shall be the beginning of months to us."
   Labor for it, therefore, and make it your heart's desire! If you live
   to see a district in which you labor permeated with the Gospel, what a
   joy! If we shall live to see London with every house sprinkled with the
   redeeming blood! If we should live to see all England feeding, not as
   many do at Christmas to excess, on the delicacies of earth, but
   feasting spiritually, where there can be no excess, upon Christ, oh,
   what a beginning of years it would be to our happy island! What a
   paradise it would be! If it should be so with France; if it should be
   so in any country, what a day to be remembered! Commence a nation's
   annals from its evangelization! Begin the chronicle of a people from
   the day when they bow at the feet of Jesus!

   There will come a day to this poor earth when all over it Jesus shall
   reign! It may be far away, yet, but the day shall come when Christ
   shall have dominion from sea to sea! The nations which are called
   Christians, although they so little deserve the title, do already date
   their chronology from the birth of Christ--and this is a sort of faint
   foreshadowing of the way in which men shall one day date all things
   from the reign of Jesus--for His unsuffering kingdom shall yet come.
   God has decreed His triumph and on all the wings of time it hastens.
   When He comes, that month shall be the beginning of months unto us! I
   say no more.

   III. And now, in the last place, I come to show in what light this date
   is to be regarded if it has occurred to us in the senses I have
   mentioned. Primarily, if it has occurred in the first sense to us
   personally--what about it, then? Why, first, the day in which we first
   knew the Savior as the Paschal Lamb should always be the most honorable
   day that has ever dawned upon us! The Israelites placed the month Abib
   in the first rank because it was the month of the Passover--put down
   the date at which you knew the Lord as the premier day, the noblest
   hour you have ever known! It eclipses your natural birthday, for then
   you were born in sin! Then you were "born to trouble as the sparks fly
   upward." But now you are born into spiritual life, born unto eternal
   bliss!

   It eclipses your marriage day, for union to Christ shall bring you
   greater felicity than the happiest of conjugal bonds. If you have ever
   known a day in which you received the honors of the State, or gained
   distinction in learning, or attained to a position in society, or
   arrived at a larger wealth--all these were but dim, cloudy, foggy days
   compared with this "morning without clouds!" On that day your sun rose
   never to go down again! The die was cast, your destiny for Glory was
   openly declared! I pray you never in your thoughts degrade that blessed
   day by thinking more of any pleasure, honor or advancement than you do
   of the blessing of salvation by the blood of Jesus!

   I am afraid that some are striving and struggling after other
   distinctions and if they could once reach a certain event, then they
   would be satisfied. Is not your salvation worth vastly more than this?
   They would feel that they were made of life if a certain matter turned
   out right. Brothers and Sisters, you were made for life when you were
   made anew in Christ Jesus! You came to your estate when you came to
   Christ! You were promoted when He received you to His friendship! You
   gained all that you need desire when you found Christ, for a saint of
   old said, "He is all my salvation and all my de-

   sire." Do not, therefore, if the Queen should knight you, or the people
   should send you to Parliament, think that the event would overshadow
   your conversion and salvation!

   Think of that act of Grace as the Lord thinks of it, for He says,
   "Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honorable and I
   have loved you." Unto you that believe, Jesus is honor--in Him you
   boast and glory--and well you may! The blood-mark is a Believer's chief
   adornment and decoration--and his being cleansed and set free by Grace
   is his noblest distinction! Glory in Grace and in nothing else! Prize
   the work of Grace beyond all the treasures of Egypt! This date is to be
   regarded as the beginning of life! The Israelites reckoned that all
   their former existence as a nation had been death. The brick kilns of
   Egypt, the lying among the pots, the mixing up with idolaters, the
   hearing of a language which they understood not--they looked on all
   Egyptian experience as death--and the month which ended it was to them
   the beginning of months. On the other hand, they looked upon all that
   followed after as being life. The Passover was the beginning and only
   the beginning--a beginning implies something to follow it.

   Now then, Christian men and women, whenever you speak about your
   existence before conversion, always do it with shamefacedness, as one
   risen from the dead might speak of the morgue and the worm of
   corruption. I feel grieved when I hear or read of people who can stand
   up and talk about what they used to do, before they were converted,
   very much in the way in which an old seafaring man talks of his voyages
   and storms. No, no, be ashamed of your former lusts in your ignorance!
   And if you must speak of them to the praise and Glory of Christ, speak
   with bated breath and tears and sighs. Death, rottenness, corruption
   are all most fitly left in silence, or, if they demand a voice, let it
   be as solemn and mournful as a knell. Let your sin story be told in a
   way which shall show that you wish it had never been true. Let your
   conversion be the burial of the old existence and as for that which
   follows after, take care that you make it real life, worthy of the
   Grace which has quickened you.

   Suppose these Israelites had loitered about in Egypt? Suppose one of
   them had said, "Well, I did not finish that batch of bricks. I cannot
   go out just yet. I should like to see them thoroughly well baked and
   prepared for the pyra-mid"--what a foolish fellow he would have been!
   No, but they left the bricks, the clay, the stuff behind and went
   straight away--and they let Egypt take care of itself. Now, child of
   God, quit the ways of sin with determination. Leave the world, leave
   its pleasure, leave its cares and get right away to Jesus and His
   leadership! You are now the Lord's free man--shall the blood be
   sprinkled for nothing? Shall the lamb be eaten and mean nothing? Shall
   the leavened bread be purged out in vain? Shall the Red Sea be crossed,
   the Egyptians drowned and you remain a slave? The thought is abhorrent!

   That was the mischief about the Israelites, that they had, still, a
   hankering after the leeks and garlic of Egypt! These strong smelling
   things had scented their garments and it is hard to get such vile odors
   out of one's clothes. Alas, that Egyptian garlic clings to us--and the
   smell of it is not always so abominable to us as it ought to be!
   Besides, they pined for fish which they ate in Egypt in plenty, muddy
   fish though it was. There were better fish for them in Jordan,
   Genne-saret and the Great Sea, if they had gone ahead. And there were
   sweeter herbs on Canaan's hills than ever grew in Egypt's mire. Because
   of this evil lusting, they were kept dodging about for 40 years in the
   wilderness. They might have marched into Canaan in 40 days if it had
   not been for that stinking garlic of theirs and their Egyptian habits
   and memories!

   Oh, that God would cut us quite free and enable us to forget those
   things of which we are now ashamed! I have nearly finished when I have
   added this, that inasmuch as the Passover was now the beginning of the
   year to them, it was the putting of all things right. I told you that
   the year had formerly begun in autumn, according to most
   traditions--was this really the best season to pitch upon? Upon second
   thoughts, was autumn the best season in which to begin life, with
   winter all before you and everything declining? By the institution of
   the Passover, the year was made to begin in what is our spring. If I
   judge from the condition of our land I should ask--When could the year
   begin more fitly than in the springtide of early May? It seems to me
   that it actually does begin in the spring.

   I do not see that the year naturally begins today, though it does so
   arbitrarily. We are in about the middle of winter and the year, as yet,
   lies dead. When the birds sing and the flowers rise from their beds on
   earth, then the year begins! It seems to me a strange supposition that
   our first parents commenced life in autumn, amid lengthening nights and
   declining forces. No, we say, by all means let the date be fixed in
   spring, so that the salutations of the new year shall be sweet with
   fragrant flowers and rich with joyous songs. Nor would the time of our
   spring in the East be a season without supplies, for in April and May
   the first ears of corn are ready and many other fruits are fit for
   food. It was good for the Isra-

   elites to have the feast of the first fruits in the month of Abib, to
   bring the first ears to the Lord and not to wait till they were ripe
   before they blessed the Giver of all good.

   We ought to be grateful for green mercies and not tarry till everything
   comes to ripeness. In some parts of the East there is fruit all the
   year round and why not in Eden? In the delightful country where I have
   sojourned, which bears a very close resemblance to the East, there are
   fruits still ripening upon the trees and one tree or another will be
   found to bear fruit every month all the year round, so that if Adam had
   been created in the month of April there would have been food for him,
   followed by a succession of fruits which would have supplied all his
   needs. Then he would have had summer before him with all its ripening
   beauties--and this is a more paradisiacal outlook than winter. It is
   right that the year should begin with the first fruits and I am sure it
   is quite right that the year should begin with you and with me when we
   come to Christ and receive the first fruits of the Spirit.

   Everything is out of joint till a man knows Christ! Everything is
   disorderly and bottom upwards till the Gospel comes and turns him
   upside down--and then the right side is up again! Man is all wrong till
   the Gospel puts him all right. Though Grace is above nature, it is not
   contrary to nature, but restores true nature. Our nature is never so
   truly the nature of a man as when it is no longer man's sinful nature.
   We become truly men, such as God meant men to be, when we cease to be
   men such as sin has made men to be! Our life, beginning, as it does, at
   our spiritual Passover, and at our feeding upon Christ, we ought always
   to regard our conversion as a festival and remember it with praise.
   Whenever we look back upon it, the memory of it should excite delight
   in our hearts.

   I wonder how long a man ought to thank God for forgiving his sins? Is
   life long enough? Is time long enough? Is eternity too long? How long
   ought a man to thank God for saving him from going down to Hell? Would
   50 years suffice? Oh no, that would never do--the blessing is too great
   to be all sung of in a millennium! Suppose you and I never had a single
   mercy except this one, that we were made the children of God and
   co-heirs with Christ Jesus? Suppose we had nothing else to enjoy? We
   ought to sing about that, alone, forever and ever! Yes, if we were
   sick, cast on the bed of pain with a hundred diseases--with our bones
   sticking through our skin--yet since God's everlasting mercy will
   sanctify every pain and every affliction, should we not still continue
   to lift up happy Psalms to God and praise Him forever and ever?

   Therefore, let that be your watchword all through the
   year--"Hallelujah, praise the Lord!" The Israelite always closed the
   Passover with a hymn of praise and, therefore, let us close our sermon
   this morning with holy joy and continue our happy music till this year
   ends, yes, till time shall be no more! Amen.

Men Without Heart, Sight, or Hearing

   (No. 1638)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 8, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   Yet the Lord has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and
   ears to hear, to this day."

   Deuteronomy 29:4.

   FEELING, sight, hearing. What wonderful things these are! If we could
   exist without them, what a wretched condition ours would be. The outer
   world would be unknown to us if the gates of the senses were shut. And
   the soul would be famished, like Samaria when it was shut up and there
   was no going in nor coming out. Take away from us the power of
   perception by touch, smell, taste, sight and hearing--and it would be
   of small account to us that the world was beautiful--for to our
   consciousness there would scarcely be a world at all. All the colors of
   the rainbow, the warmth of the sun, the freshness of the breeze, the
   sweetness of honey, the charms of music and even the terrors of storms
   would cease! And the soul would be shut up within the body as within a
   prison which had neither doors nor windows. The dreariest dungeon of
   the Bastille would be liberty compared with such a state!

   Perhaps the mind would exist, but certainly it could not live. It would
   be a misuse of language to call it life. When any one of the senses is
   gone, it involves great deprivation and subjects the person enduring it
   to the pity of his fellows. But if all were absent, what wretchedness
   must ensue! Loss of sight or hearing creates among us a large number of
   sufferers who deserve our sympathy, but what mourning would suffice for
   those, if there were, indeed, any such, who physically had neither
   heart to perceive, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear?

   Transfer your thoughts, now, from these external senses by which we
   become conscious of the external world to those spiritual senses by
   which we perceive the spiritual world, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Lord
   of that Kingdom and all the powers of the world to come. There is a
   heart which should be tender, by which we perceive the Presence of God
   and feel His operations and even behold the Lord, Himself, as it is
   written, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." There
   is a spiritual eye by which the things invisible are discerned! Blessed
   are they to whom the Lord has given to see the things of His Kingdom,
   which to the unrenewed remain hidden in parables! There is a spiritual
   ear by which we hear the gentle whispers of the Spirit which frequently
   come to us internally, without the medium of sounds that can affect the
   ears. Blessed are those who have the ear which the Lord has purged,
   cleansed and opened so that it listens to the Divine

   call!

   But there is no blessedness in the case of men devoid of spiritual
   feeling, sight and hearing. Theirs is a miserable plight! Just what the
   blind man, the deaf man and the man who is destitute of feeling would
   be in the outer world--that is what many men are as to the spiritual
   world. Alas, there are among us, in this congregation this day, and all
   around us in myriads, poor souls of whom this text is true, "The Lord
   has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear,
   to this day." This is a very, very mournful case. But perhaps the most
   lamentable aspect of it is that the persons who are thus devoid of the
   spiritual senses, by which they can converse with the best and highest
   world, are not conscious of their incapacity, or, if partially
   conscious of it, seem to be stupidly contented to remain as they are!

   The naturally blind man would see if he could! What shall I say of
   those whose inability to see spiritually is willful and lies more in
   their will than anywhere else? The man who cannot hear the voice of his
   fellow would greatly rejoice if the gates of sound once opened to him.
   But there are none so deaf as those who will not hear--whose deafness
   is moral-- whose inability to hear the voice of God lies in this fact
   that they deliberately close their ears to the voice of holy
   exhortation. They are ready enough to listen to the siren songs of
   temptation. And they bend a willing ear to the subtle deceit of the
   serpent, but they will not regard the tender, loving wisdom of the Good
   Shepherd! They are quick of hearing to evil, but deaf to good!

   This is the sad part of it--they are blind and do not want to see! They
   are deaf and do not wish to hear! Our poet

   says--

   "How helpless guilty nature lies, Unconscious of its load."

   In this unconsciousness lies the heart of the mischief. Helpless man is
   unconscious of his own helplessness! Because they say, "We see,"
   therefore their sin remains. If they were blind and knew it, it were
   another matter, and signs of hope would be visible. But to be blind and
   yet to boast of having superior sight--and to ridicule those who
   see--is the lamentable condition of not a few! They will not thank us
   for our pity, but much they need it. Eyes have they, but they see not
   and yet they glory in their blindness! Multitudes around us are in this
   plight.

   When the Prophet says, "Bring forth the blind people that have eyes,"
   we can only wonder where we should put them all if they were willing to
   assemble in one place! My own spirit feels very heavy in having to
   preach upon this subject this morning, but I wish to do so with great
   tenderness of heart, lamenting while I blame. It seems to me that Moses
   felt very tenderly to the people whom he here addresses. He puts his
   meaning in the gentlest conceivable shape when he says, "The Lord has
   not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear, to
   this day." He does not excuse, but yet he softly chides. He speaks not
   with the stern severity of Isaiah when he cried in the name of the
   Lord, "Go and tell this people, Hear you, indeed, but understand not;
   and see you, indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people
   fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes lest they see with
   their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
   and convert, and be healed."

   What a sad thing it is that so many are rich in all things except the
   one thing necessary. God has given them abundance of earthly
   possessions, but He has not given them eyes to see His bounty, nor ears
   to hear His voice of love, nor a heart to perceive His Presence in the
   mercies which they enjoy. Such see the harvest, but not the Great
   Farmer! They enjoy the fruitful seasons, but take no delight in the
   Giver of the rain and the Sender of the sunshine! What a sad condition
   to be in! Alas, poor rich man! He has so much and yet so little! And
   what a lamentable sight is the educated man of this world who is
   learned in all the lore of the ancients and versed in all the science
   of the moderns! He, who has pried into the secret chambers of knowledge
   and has observed the skill of the Eternal in the starry heavens and in
   microscopic life--and yet, with all his attainments, has no knowledge
   of his Maker--and will not accept the evidence of His Presence!

   How sad that we should have to say to such, "Yes, you know all the
   facts, and yet cannot see beneath their surface. You allow prejudice to
   blind your eyes to the plain teaching of Creation and Providence. You
   walk through the studio and admire the pictures--and deny the artist's
   existence! Whereas, if you were candid, you would believe in him from
   his works and then go on to spell out his character from them. Alas,
   you have not a heart to perceive, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear to
   this day." Well spoke the Apostle when he said, "Not many great men
   after the flesh, not many learned are called." Often, those that know
   the most of the secular know the least of the sacred. Eyes that seem as
   if they could pierce through rocks and read the mysteries of primeval
   night, turn out to be mere sightless eyeballs as to Divine things.

   Yet they know it not, neither guess at their folly. How sad it is that
   there should be so many who are quick in reasoning and ready in
   invention, who cannot see that the visible argues an invisible
   Creator--and that Providential arrangements prove that a Great Father
   is over all. As Herbert says, they, "walk with their staff to Heaven."
   They thread the stars like beads upon a string. They harness the
   lightning and weigh the starry orbs. And yet they have not discovered
   their God, who is above, around, outside and within them! They are
   open-eyed to all things but unto Him who fills all in all! I fear I
   must apply to them the language of Paul, "Having the understanding
   darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance
   that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart."

   This morning I shall speak, as I shall be helped by the Holy Spirit,
   first upon a very mournful fact. Secondly, upon a yet more mournful
   reason for that fact. And thirdly, upon a mournful result which comes
   out of that fact. May what is said be taken as a word of warning and
   may God, the Holy Spirit bless it to the conversion of everyone here
   present who remains as yet unrenewed! I say everyone, for there is not
   one among you whom I would knowingly exempt from my prayers.

   I. First, we shall think upon A MOURNFUL FACT. Here was a whole nation,
   with but very few exceptions, of whom their leader, who knew them best
   and loved them best, was obliged to say, "The Lord has not given you a
   heart to perceive to this day." The mournful part of it was that this
   was the nation that had been specially favored of God above

   all others. God had not entered into covenant with Edom or with Moab.
   He had not sent the light of His Truth to Egypt, or to Ethiopia, nor to
   any other of the nations of antiquity. But this comparatively little
   and insignificant people had been selected that to it might be
   committed the oracles of God! They were the one candlestick of the
   human race! They had light in their dwellings while all around them
   brooded a darkness which might be felt.

   By His name, Jehovah the Lord was made known to them when He spoke to
   Moses in the desert and manifested Himself to him in the burning bush.
   "He made known His ways to Moses, His acts unto the children of
   Israel." He gave to this people Revelation after Revelation, containing
   guidance, rule, comfort and instruction, even as it is written, "He has
   not dealt so with any people." Almost all the Light of God then given
   was focused upon Israel and yet they had not eyes to see! "God speaks
   once, yes, twice, yet man perceives it not for need of ears which can
   hear." Is not this a dreadful thing? I can understand the other nations
   being blind and senseless, for they were in the dark and, "the times of
   their ignorance God winked at," but for this nation, upon whom the Sun
   of Righteousness had risen--to choose darkness and abhor the Light is a
   horrible thing! By the preciousness of the privilege, the sin of its
   rejection was greatly enhanced.

   This is sad, sad to the utmost degree of sadness, but is it not the
   case with some of you? Are there not among you those who have the
   clearest Light of God and yet choose the ways of darkness? My dear
   Hearers, be honest with yourselves and answer! Born of godly parents;
   singled out to be carefully instructed in the things of God; attending
   a faithful ministry from your youth up; reading your Bible and being
   thoroughly versed in its contents and yet, for all that, without godly
   feeling and gracious perception! I grieve that you should have such
   privileges and yet remain strangers to salvation! Will it be so
   forever? Shall it always be said of you, "The Lord has not given you a
   heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear, to this day"?

   Note again, that not only were they a highly favored people, but they
   had seen very wonderful acts performed by the Lord Himself. Moses says,
   "You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of
   Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land,
   the great temptations which your eyes have seen, the signs and those
   great miracles." Does it not seem deplorable that they could see God
   lifting His hand against Pharaoh with plague after plague and yet not
   acknowledge Him to be the only living and true God? Those plagues smote
   the gods of Egypt--how could Israel ever turn aside to worship such
   dishonored deities? Each plague was aimed against some sacred object of
   Egyptian worship and the marvel is that these defeated idols should
   still be worshipped by Israel!

   Truly the Lord spoke with a loud voice from Heaven--with a voice which
   even Pharaoh was compelled to hear-- and yet His own people heard Him
   not! They saw the plagues and did not discern the Glory of their God so
   as to remain faithful to Him. And that Red Sea! Was not that marvel
   enough? How often have I wished that I could have been there to see the
   eager waters leap on Pharaoh and all his hosts! What joy to have heard
   the sound of the timbrel and to have seen the twinkling feet of the
   maidens as they danced and chanted, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has
   triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider He has cast into the
   sea."

   Could men stand there and see that and yet not perceive that the gods
   of the heathen are idols--and that only Jehovah is the living and true
   God? And could they shake off the fear and dread of this mighty God
   from their souls and turn to worship a golden calf which their own
   hands had made? Yes, such is the deplorable wickedness of man that if
   God were to work, over again, all the miracles of Egypt in the sight of
   those of you who are unbelievers, you would not be converted to His
   fear! You would be staggered by the wonder, but you would not be
   converted by the witness! Something else is needed over and above all
   miracles before the blinded eye will care to see, or the hardened heart
   will begin to feel! You, also, have witnessed great deeds of Grace in
   our midst, and yet you are not convinced. You even believe in all the
   miracles of Scripture and in the death and Resurrection of our Lord
   Jesus--and yet you do not trust Him! Ah me, what can I say? What can I
   do but mourn over you?

   In addition to this, these people had passed through a very remarkable
   experience. They had been brought out of Egypt by miracle and, by the
   same power, they had passed through the depths of the sea as on dry
   land! Moses thus describes their wilderness history--"And I have led
   you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon
   you, and your shoe is not waxen old upon your foot. You have not eaten
   bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink: that you might know
   that I am the Lord your God." All these 40 years they lived by
   miracles--and yet they neither feared, nor loved, nor trusted Jehovah
   their God who worked all these signs among them! As a nation they did
   not receive the spiritual teaching which the Lord set before them.

   Do you blame them? Look at your home. Are they the only people who have
   thus offended? May I not be addressing some, today, whose experience
   has been singularly full of mercy and love? God has been strangely
   gracious to you, my Friend. He has led you by a way that you knew not
   and, if you could but see it, His hand has been conspicuously with you
   from the time when you left your father's house unto this day! I know
   not to whom I may be speaking, but I am persuaded that there are some
   here whose career has been especially marked by the Providence of God.
   Yours has been no common journey of life. You have been preserved in
   accident and restored from sickness. The stars in their courses have
   seemed to fight for you--and the stones of the field have joined to
   defend you--and yet you do not observe the hand of the Lord in all
   this!

   The Lord has girded you though you have not known Him! He has guided
   you, restrained you, delivered you, instructed you even though you have
   not deigned to think of Him. Yes, He has saved you from the
   consequences of your own folly, or you would long before this have been
   a beggar, or a mass of sores, or a prisoner in the most dreaded
   dungeon! He has interposed to save you from your own folly! And here
   you are where mercy pleads and Grace holds out her silver scepter.
   Alas, even to this day you have not a heart to perceive the
   long-suffering of God, nor eyes to see your obligations, nor ears to
   hear the wooing of His love--you are still going on in rebellion
   against God. Shall it always be so? It is grievous that it has been
   thus so long. Is there no turning? Is there no relenting? Must you die
   in your sins?

   In addition to all this sight and experience, the Israelites had
   received remarkable instruction. In the wilderness, the Lord taught
   them by Moses and Aaron. The Tabernacle was pitched in their midst,
   according to the pattern which Moses had seen on the mountain, and
   there a worship was instituted, every part of which was singularly rich
   in instruction, as we all know to this day. There was not a lamb
   slaughtered, nor a lamp kindled, nor a handful of incense burned on the
   altar, nor a curtain folded up, nor a silver socket set in its place
   without some moral and spiritual significance. Had they desired to
   learn it, they might have discovered in the Tabernacle in the
   wilderness great stores of teachings as to those things which make for
   the peace and salvation of men--but they had no heart to perceive, nor
   eyes to see, nor ears to hear--and so the whole apparatus of teaching
   was lost upon them.

   Ah, dear Hearers, you may enjoy the most clear instruction; you may
   have line upon line, precept upon precept; you may read God's Book,
   itself, and you may observe the experience of Christians--and you may
   have all their love and affection to help you to understand the things
   of God--and yet for all that you may remain without spiritual
   perception! All the external processes of holy teaching may spend
   themselves in vain upon you for 40, 50, 60, or even 70 years and you
   may still remain blind and unfeeling! You may know the letter of
   doctrine and yet never perceive its meaning. You may see the logical
   nature and certainty of a sacred Truth of God and yet never see its
   bearings upon yourself. Does your present condition prove this
   assertion? Are you, also without understanding? Are you still untaught
   in the things of God? O that the Holy Spirit may now create in you a
   new heart and bestow both spiritual eyes and ears upon you!

   One thing else is worth notice. These people had been associated with
   remarkable characters. They were not all blinded--there were a few
   among them who were gracious and so were made to perceive. Caleb and
   Joshua were there, and Aaron and Miriam, but chiefly there was Moses,
   grandest of men, true father of the nation! It was something to have
   lived in a camp where you could speak with such a man as Moses, who had
   seen God, face to face, so that upon his brow there rested the glow of
   Deity when he came down from the mountain! You, too, my Friends, have
   met with those whose conversation has been in Heaven and whose lives
   are bright with communion with the Lord!

   If we do not see and will not see where another sees so clearly, we
   stand condemned! A man who considers himself highly intelligent stands
   with me upon the hill. He looks out upon a fair landscape over which
   hangs a wonderful sky bedecked with fleecy clouds. At our feet blooms a
   wealth of lovely flowers. He tells me that in all this he sees no
   evidence of God. Is he blind? As for me, I feel myself surrounded by
   the all-embracing Deity and His Presence is the greatest fact of my
   consciousness--

   "God has a Presence and that you may see In the fold of the flower, the
   leaf of the tree; In the sun of the noon, the star of the night; In the
   storm cloud of darkness, the rainbow of light; In the waves of the
   ocean, the furrows of land; In the mountains of granite, the atom of
   sand! Turn where you may, from the sky to the sod,

   Where can you gaze that you see not God?" Now, either I am a liar or
   else my neighbor is sadly dull of perception! And as I know that I
   speak the truth, I know, also, that he is blind! If Moses saw, he, by
   that fact, left the rest of the people without excuse!

   That they would not perceive was exceedingly provoking to the Lord, for
   among them God was manifest in the most remarkable manner. The Lord
   came from Sinai and the Holy One from Paran. From the top of the
   smoking mountain He spoke with voice of trumpet and with sound of
   thunder--the earth shook and trembled beneath His feet! The Lord was
   among them conspicuously in the flaming pillar by night and in the
   shadowing cloud by day. Israel saw the Glory of her God! She could not
   help seeing it and yet the people refused to behold Him and asked, "Is
   the Lord among us or not?" Moses said of them, "They are a nation void
   of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. O that they
   were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their
   latter end!" Even to the very end of 40 years of patient instruction
   they remained without the true knowledge of God!

   Ah me! This is sad, most sad! But I fear that in this congregation we
   have a number who are like they are. Years have not brought them Grace,
   nor has a lifetime yielded them wisdom! They have seen God's wonders of
   Grace upon their friends and relatives. They have also tasted of the
   Lord's goodness in their own lives--and they have heard His voice in
   the preaching of the Gospel, for Jesus Christ has been evidently set
   forth as crucified among them--and yet they have not seen the Lord and
   do not hear Him even to this day! This is no new thing, but it is, none
   the less, a grief of heart to those of us who fear the Lord and feel a
   love for souls.

   Brothers and Sisters, remember that these Jews, in subsequent
   generations, had great Prophets among them and what was the success of
   their labor? Did they not cry, "Who has believed our report?" At length
   they saw the Son of God among them and how did He fare? Jesus Himself,
   with all His miracles of Grace and words of love, came unto His own
   people and they received Him not, but cried, "Crucify Him, crucify
   Him!" How true it is that nothing can bless men till almighty Grace
   renews them! If one should rise from the dead, men would not repent
   unless they were renewed! There is no miracle that God can do; there is
   no marvel that Omnipotence, itself, can perform which can make men, who
   have no spiritual eyes, see! Nothing can make men feel so long as their
   hearts remain hardened against the Most High. "The natural man receives
   not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him;
   neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."

   Verily is it written with truth, "You must be born again." The unbelief
   of man, so long as it remains, renders blessing impossible. The Gospels
   represent our Lord Himself as baffled by man's refusal to believe, as
   it is written, "He could not do many mighty works there because of
   their unbelief." Oh the wretchedness of this state of things! Who shall
   deliver men from it? Who can attempt the task but God alone?

   II. We will now hasten to spend a few minutes in descending into a
   still lower depth. Let us note THE MOURNFUL REASONS FOR ALL THIS. The
   reasons for their incapacity to see and perceive lay, first, in the
   fact that these people never believed in their own blindness. They had
   no heart to perceive and they did not perceive their absence of
   perception--they had no eyes with which to detect their own dimness of
   vision! They were such fools as to dote on their own wisdom! They were
   so poor as to think themselves rich, so hypocritical as to profess to
   be sincere! They thought they knew better than their God and so they
   sat in judgment upon His Providence and styled the provision of His
   wisdom. They were so quick of perception that when Moses was gone away
   for a little while, they said, "Make us gods, which shall go before us;
   as for this Moses, we know not what has become of him."

   They showed their pretended wisdom by suspecting both the Lord and His
   servant Moses as soon as they fell into any difficulty. "Because there
   were no graves in Egypt, therefore has He brought us forth that we may
   die in the wilderness?" They would snatch from Jehovah's hand the rod
   of government and become leaders for themselves! Jeshurun forsook God
   that made him and lightly esteemed the Rock of His salvation. They were
   wise in their own conceits and, therefore it was that they could not
   see. Pride is the great creator of darkness, like Nahash, the Ammonite,
   it puts out the right eye! Men seek not the Light of God because they
   boast that they are the children of the day and need no light from
   above!

   More than this, these men never asked for a heart to perceive, eyes to
   see and ears to hear. No man has ever asked for these things and been
   refused--no soul has cried in its blindness and darkness, "Open my
   eyes," but what a gracious answer has always come! It is the
   prerogative of the Lord Jesus to open the blind eyes, but this He is
   always ready to do whenever men call upon His name. Let but the poor
   man cry and the Lord Jesus must and will hear him and pour the day-

   light into his soul. In Israel's case there was a distinct refusal to
   be blest--"But My people would not hearken to My voice; and Israel
   would have none of Me."

   There was no prayer for the heavenly blessing, but an aversion to it.
   "You have not, because you ask not." "They know not, neither will they
   understand; they walk on in darkness." Rightly are those left in
   darkness who will not ask God to give them light, or to open their
   eyes! Is not this the case with some of you? O my Hearers, I must be
   plain and personal with you--is it not true that some of you are
   prayerless, Christless, graceless? What will become of you? Your case
   is all the more to be lamented because you are without excuse! Then,
   moreover, what little light they did have, they resisted. When they
   were forced to see, it was only for a moment that they would be
   instructed--and then they shut their eyes, again. "When He slew them,
   then they sought Him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
   And they remembered that God was their Rock and the high God their
   redeemer. Nevertheless they did flatter Him with their mouth and they
   lied to Him with their tongues."

   When He sent fiery serpents among them, or otherwise smote them, then
   they perceived His Presence for a while, but soon they turned back and
   dealt deceitfully. They took up the tabernacle of Moloch and the star
   of their God, Remphan, and worshipped engraved images in secret in
   their tents so that they provoked the Lord to jealousy. And He was
   incensed against them. They loved darkness rather than light because
   their deeds were evil! They did not actually cry like Pharaoh, "Who is
   Jehovah that I should obey His voice?" but in their hearts they meant
   it. They lusted after the abominable rites of Baalpeor and fell into
   filthiness in the days of Balaam, although God, Himself, dwelt among
   them in all His matchless purity and holiness!

   Now, this is the gravest crime of all--to leave the holy God for impure
   idolatries! Oh sinners that love not God, is it not because you love
   that which is evil? Oh, you that never see Him or seek after Him, is
   not the cause of your blindness to be found in your love of sin? "He
   that does evil hates the light." This willfulness of yours; this
   desperate bent of your hearts towards evil--how will you answer for it?
   Our fear for you is great--we are afraid that you will perish through
   your hardness of heart! Oh that you had a desire towards God! Oh that
   you willed to turn to Jesus! Oh that His Grace would cure you of your
   stiff-necked rebellion! Jesus stands here this morning and He cries,
   "How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen
   gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not." He waits to
   be gracious! Do you doubt this?

   He has given you all manner of good things. Do you think He would have
   refused you eyes to see and a heart to feel if these had been sought?
   "He gives liberally and upbraids not." If we, being evil, know how to
   give good gifts to our children, how much more will our heavenly Father
   give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him? But no--men choose their own
   delusions! They abide in their darling sins! They perish by suicide!
   Like Saul, every unbeliever falls upon his own sword. "Israel, you have
   destroyed yourself." Yet you delight in your destruction and you enter
   into league with that which devours you. You are a prisoner, but you
   hug your chains! You see not, for you willfully blow out the candle!
   You hear not, for you cover your own ears--you are spiritually
   dead--but you have chosen corruption!

   By prejudice, pride and hardness of heart you have shut out yourself
   from love. Ah me, that such folly as this should be continued by any
   who frequent this house of prayer! Can it be possible that you are so
   foolish? Blessed be the Lord, many of you have eyes to see and ears to
   hear! Let all such adore the Sovereign Grace which has given these
   gifts to them. Let them worship the love which has sweetly conquered
   their stubborn will, leading their captivity captive, and giving them
   to feel and know and taste of spiritual things! Not to you be the
   glory, but to the Lord alone! To those who know not the Lord, there is
   shame and confusion. But to those who have known Him, there is no
   self-glorification, for, as the wise man says, "The hearing ear and the
   seeing eye, the Lord has made even both of them." To be blind of heart
   is our sin--but to be made to see is the gift of Grace! Our misery is
   our own work, but our salvation is of the Lord!

   III. I conclude by noticing what was THE MOURNFUL RESULT of these
   people being so highly favored and privileged and yet not seeing nor
   discerning their God. The result was, first, that they missed a happy
   portion. I can hardly imagine how happy the children of Israel might
   have been. They left Egypt with a high hand and an outstretched arm.
   Their ears were hung with jewels and their purses were filled with
   riches, while around them manna dropped from Heaven and cool streams
   flowed at their side! They might have made a quick march to the
   promised land and at once entered their rest, for their God who had
   sent the hornet before them would soon have driven out their
   adversaries! "How should one have chased a thousand, and two put ten
   thousand to flight."

   In the land of promise they would have dwelt securely and God would
   have given them rest. Then would the heavens have heard the earth and
   the earth would have yielded such harvests that one year in seven they
   would have had no need either to sow or reap, but would have spent
   their whole time in praising God! And then a jubilee would have come
   every seventh seven, in which, with high-sounding cymbals they would
   magnify the Most High! They would have known no invading enemy and felt
   neither blast, nor blight, nor mildew! In fact, they would have been
   the happiest nation under Heaven--"He should have fed them, also, with
   the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have
   satisfied you."

   They flung all this to the side--they would not have God--and so they
   could not have prosperity. They walked contrary to Him and He walked
   contrary to them. They would not obey Him and, therefore, His anger
   smoked against them. Think, moreover, what a glorious destiny they
   threw aside. Had they been equal to the occasion, by God's Grace they
   might have been a nation of kings and priests! They might have been the
   Lord's missionaries to all lands; the light-bearers to all peoples!
   Every arrangement was made to enable them to live a godly, holy,
   joyous, sanctified life. They ate angels' food and they might have
   lived angels' lives, acting as heralds, to tell others what wonders God
   had worked for them.

   Alas, they could not see the moral grandeur of so high a calling and
   they thought more of eating flesh than of honoring the Lord and
   teaching His Law. I would like to say to some of you that God has been
   setting before you an open door and yet you have not perceived Him, nor
   loved Him. He would make saints of you and you are content to be
   money-grubbers. You have judged yourselves unworthy of the prize which
   He has set before you! You do not know what a happy lot you have
   declined. Just lately you were a young man--you are getting to middle
   life now--and you do not know what golden opportunities you have
   wasted! As Cleopatra melted pearls and swallowed them as a drink, so
   have you drunk down the possibilities of Glory as if they were common
   things! What might not God have done with some of you if your hearts
   had been given to Him years ago! By this time you might have achieved a
   lifework glorious to God, honorable to yourself and happy to your
   friends.

   The stuff is in you which might have been molded into a minister, a
   missionary, a soul-winner--and you might have been among the happiest
   and best of men! Nor does the waste end with yourself! You are causing
   damage to many others. Your children are growing up to follow your
   follies, wasting their lives as you have squandered yours. Oh, had you
   yielded to Jesus years ago your sons might have been your honor and
   comfort--and your daughters your joy and delight! You have flung away
   such opportunities as could not be bought for gold! Thus says the Lord,
   "Oh that My people had hearkened unto Me, and Israel had walked in My
   ways! I should soon have subdued their enemies and turned My hand
   against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord should have submitted
   themselves unto Him: but their time should have endured forever." Happy
   are God's people, but wretched are they who, being placed where they
   could see God's hand, yet will not see it--placed where they could hear
   God's voice, yet will not hear it, but refuse the Kingdom of Heaven
   which has come so near unto them.

   Another result was that while they missed so high a position, they went
   on sinning. As they did not learn the lesson God was teaching them,
   namely, that He was God and that to serve Him was their joy and their
   prosperity, they went from one evil to another, provoking the Lord to
   jealousy. From repining and murmuring they went on to rebelling. "Let
   us make a captain," they said, "and let us return to Egypt." From being
   idolatrous they became lascivious and fell into the sin of uncleanness
   with the women of Moab. Often they were actual idolaters and always
   they were unstable of heart. So they went from one sin to another
   because they had not a heart to perceive, nor ears to hear their God.
   Therefore they frequently suffered.

   A plague broke out one time and a fire at another. At one time they
   were visited with fever and another time the earth opened beneath them.
   One day the Amalekites smote them. Another day fiery serpents leaped up
   from the sand and they died by the thousands, being poisoned by their
   bites. They suffered much and often--and in all their trials they did
   but reap what they had sown. A man does not know what he is doing when
   he sins. We tell our naughty children that we have rods in pickle for
   them--and this is assuredly the case with the great Father who has
   chastisement laid up for the people who willfully revolt from Him! He
   brings forth sorrow and wrath for those who harden their hearts and
   continue in their iniquities. Ah, my Hearers, how many of you are, this
   day, reaping what your own hands have sown!

   At last this evil ended terribly. The Lord lifted His hand to Heaven
   and swore that the rebellious generation should not enter into His
   rest--and they began to die by wholesale till Moses cried, "We are
   consumed by Your anger and by Your wrath are we troubled." Not one of
   the men that came out of Egypt, save only Joshua and Caleb, reached the
   promised land. Whenever they pitched their tents at eventide, the first
   thing was to celebrate the funerals of the day. The tribes marched on
   and on--at the end of the march they stumbled into their graves till
   the whole of that peninsula in which they had to wander up and down for
   40 years became one vast cemetery where the thousands of Israel were
   buried! Who slew all these? Not by the sword of the enemy nor by the
   arrow of the foe were they destroyed--but sin laid them in heaps as in
   the day of battle.

   They could not enter in because of their unbelief. The land that flowed
   with milk and honey lay smiling in the calm sunlight on the other side
   of Jordan, but they could not enter in because they had no heart to
   perceive, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear the Lord and His Word. And
   this is the main misery of your condition, O you careless ones, that
   you will not be able to enter into God's rest either here or hereafter!
   This is the misery of it to me--that I must set Christ before some of
   you and you will never have Him--that I must extol His atoning blood,
   but you will refuse to be washed in it! That I mast go on declaring my
   Lord's message as long as this tongue can move--bidding you believe in
   Jesus Christ and find eternal life--but still, of some of you I shall
   always have to say, "The Lord has not given you a heart to perceive and
   eyes to see and ears to hear, to this day."

   Alas, your eyes will be opened one day, in another sense. "The rich man
   saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom." Who was that? That was
   a Jew of the kind I have described who had everything in this life,
   being clothed in purple and faring sumptuously every day! But he had no
   heart to perceive nor eyes to see. "In Hell he lifted up his eyes,
   being in torments." Oh, my Hearers, Hell's torments will open your
   eyes! Will you wait till then? O you ungodly ones, you will think,
   then! I pray God you may have sense enough to think now, while thinking
   will be of use to you. If there is a Heaven, seek it! If there is a
   Hell, escape it! If there is a God, love Him! If there is a Christ,
   trust Him! If there is sin, seek to be washed from it! If there is
   pardon, rest not till you have it! Oh do not mock your Savior! Do not
   make a game of eternal realities! Be in earnest about this and in
   earnest at once!

   If you must play the fool, trifle with something less precious than
   your souls! Procure toys less expensive than your own immortal
   destinies! Oh, that God would bless this word to you careless ones,
   that you may feel at once that you do not feel as you should and begin
   to cry to God to give you feeling! Oh, that you may see that you do not
   see and begin to cry, "Lord, open my eyes!" Oh, that you may hear, this
   morning, a voice which shall make you feel that you do not hear as you
   ought to hear and, therefore, must always cry to God to give you
   hearing! Remember that spiritual life is only from God. It is His gift
   and it is not bestowed according to merit, but is given by pure Grace
   to the unworthy. Seek it, and you shall have it, for so it is written,
   "He that asks, receives; he that seeks, finds, and to him that knocks
   it shall be opened."

   Will your ears again refuse the language of His Grace? Will you still
   go to your farm and to your merchandise, to your labor and to your
   amusement, and reject the voice that calls you to Glory and
   immortality? Will you trample upon the bleeding love of Jesus? Oh,
   then, what shall I do and to whom shall I turn? I must go back to my
   Master, mourning with Isaiah, "Who has believed our report, and to whom
   is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Lord, reveal Your arm and then they
   will believe the report! Amen and Amen.

Acceptable Service

   (No. 1639)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 15, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let
   us have Grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
   godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire." Hebrews 12:28,29.

   As a congregation you have of late been diligently engaged in the
   service of God by endeavoring to provide a home for fatherless
   children. I have been astonished and delighted at the liberality which
   has been shown by all sorts of persons in this good and gracious work.
   I felt, sometimes, like the king of old, who said, "Who am I, and what
   is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this
   sort?" I am sure you have well earned all the commendation that your
   fellow Christians can give to you, for the work has been so well and so
   heartily done that we all rejoice together! But, now that it is all
   over, careful thoughts arise in my mind. It is but a small thing that
   you and I should be accepted of one another--the great matter is that
   we should be accepted of the Lord. I, who am but as the doorkeeper of
   my Master's house, not only approve, but abundantly commend my fellow
   servants, but what of that? The great point is that the King, Himself,
   should say, "Well done, good and faithful servant."

   We do but see the fair externals of things, but the great Father of
   Spirits searches the hearts and tries the reins of the children of
   men--and judges after a higher standard. Therefore, with holy anxiety
   have I looked at this text and turned it over, hoping that the Holy
   Spirit may cause each one who has engaged in our benevolent work to
   examine himself and to judge his part in this labor of love, that he
   may amend any fault which may hinder his work from being a sacrifice of
   sweet savor unto the Most High. What if we should bring our sacrifice
   and the Lord should have no respect to it? That would be a repetition
   of the sad story of Cain, of whom it is written, "Unto Cain and to his
   offering the Lord had not respect." Then, indeed, would our
   countenances be fallen--but I trust it would be with repentance rather
   than rebellion!

   If unaccepted of the Lord, we would weep bitterly and ask Him that the
   sin-offering which lies at the door might be available for us. The
   chief thing is that our labor should be acceptable unto God and upon
   that subject I shall speak this morning, as the Spirit of God shall
   enable me. Many things are absolutely necessary for the acceptance of
   any service rendered unto God--of these, some are not stated in the
   text, but they are so important that I commence with mentioning them.
   The first is that the person who attempts to serve God should, himself,
   be accepted. The offerer must, himself, be accepted in the Beloved or
   his offering will be tainted by his condition and be inevitably
   unacceptable. The uncleanness of the person pollutes his sacrifice! He
   that has an impenitent heart, an unrenewed will, a disobedient mind, an
   unholy life, may perform outward acts of devotion, but the Lord says,
   to such--"Who has required this at your hand, to tread My courts? Bring
   no more vain oblations unto Me."

   The heart, itself, must be given to God, for the offering which comes
   from a heartless worshipper is a mere pretense of homage to the Most
   High. See well to that, my dear Hearers. God says "My son, give Me your
   heart." Give whatever you please afterwards, but the heart must lead
   the way--that is essential. Let a traitor in actual rebellion bring
   tribute to a king--it will be but a mockery! He must first submit
   himself unto his prince and then he may come with his token of loyalty.
   The next essential is that the act being performed by a person
   accepted, should be distinctly done as unto God. Our text speaks of
   serving God. Alas, much is done which is, in itself, externally
   commendable, but it is not acceptable to God because it is not rendered
   unto Him and with a view to His Glory.

   Some, like the Pharisees of old, give alms out of ostentation--they
   sound a trumpet before them that they may have praise of men. Verily, I
   say unto you, they have their reward and a poor reward it is! Some are
   energetic in holy work out of emulation--that they may surpass others
   and may have credit for superior ability and goodness. Like Jehu they
   cry, "Come, see my zeal for the Lord of Hosts!" Now, inasmuch as in
   this they seek their own honor and not the Glory of

   God, they cannot be accepted of Him. Better, far, the two mites dropped
   into the treasury unobserved of all but the great Master, Himself, than
   all the wealth that we could possibly bring if we made the offering
   with divided intent!

   If we would serve God, we must forget self. There must be the distinct
   desire to obey and honor the Lord and we must not act as men-pleasers,
   or as laboring for our own exaltation, otherwise the Lord will abhor
   our offering. And we must take care that all this is done with faith in
   Christ Jesus, for it is a law of universal observation in the Kingdom
   of Heaven that, "without faith it is impossible to please God." "Though
   I give my body to be burned and have not charity," says Paul, "it
   profits me nothing." And the same may be said concerning faith! He who
   does not believe in God and yet pretends to be religious, is manifestly
   either a deceiver or deceived! As the unbeliever is condemned already,
   his service can only be that of a condemned man--how can it give
   pleasure to the Lord? We must bring our offering to Jesus, our great
   High Priest, and He must present it for us, for it can only be
   acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

   These things being mentioned, I now confine myself to the text, itself,
   which has in it a world of solemn, heart-searching thought with regard
   to the acceptable service of God.

   I. And first, according to the Apostle, it we are to serve God
   acceptably it must be UNDER A SENSE OF OUR IMMEASURABLE OBLIGATION TO
   HIM. Look--"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be
   moved, let us have Grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with
   reverence and godly fear." See, Brothers and Sisters, whatever service
   we may render to God w e must begin by being receivers. Our first
   dealing with the Most High must not lie in our bringing anything to
   Him, but our accepting everything from Him! We receive--that is our
   first stage and I think it is our last, for if we are ever able to
   serve the Lord by our gifts, we shall have to confess, "Of Your own
   have we given to You."

   When we are privileged to cast our crowns before Emmanuel's Throne,
   they will be crowns which He, Himself, bestowed upon us of His own
   Sovereign Grace. Every hymn that comes up from saints made perfect is
   but an echo of almighty love! They love Him because He first loved
   them. They are first receivers and then, like pipes that are
   well-filled from the fountainhead, they pour out their contents. First
   we receive Grace and then we return service--holy service is a gift
   from beginning to end! We must, then, in approaching God, remember what
   we have received from Him. And is it not wonderful that it should be
   written, "We are receiving a kingdom"? What a gift to receive! This is
   a Divine gift we have received, not a pauper's pension, but a
   kingdom--"a kingdom which cannot be moved."

   The old dispensation or kingdom has passed away. Its ceremonial laws
   are abrogated and its very spirit is superseded by a higher spirit! We
   have entered upon another kingdom in which the ruling principle is not
   law, but love. We are not under the yoke of Moses, but we are the
   subjects of King Jesus whose yoke is easy and whose burden is light!
   The kingdom of Jesus will never end while time shall last, for He is
   the King eternal and immortal--neither will His laws be changed, nor
   shall His subjects die. Till that day when He shall deliver up the
   kingdom unto God, even the Father, and God shall be All-in-All, Jesus
   must reign! And even when the earthly mediatorial reign is consummated,
   the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven shall be continued unto us
   and we shall still be members and citizens of it! We have received an
   eternal kingdom and for this we ought to be eternally grateful.

   The shadows have vanished, but the substance abides--we have risen out
   of the types of Judaism into His Kingdom by whom Grace and truth have
   come unto us. This Gospel state abides. Above the wreck of all things
   it remains and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. Ours is
   the kingdom of Jesus Christ in which the Gospel is the Law, Believers
   are the privileged subjects and Grace and Glory are the revenue--a
   kingdom daily growing in brightness--a kingdom which shall consummate
   its glory in the eternal world when Christ shall have put all enemies
   under His feet and His people shall reign with Him forever and ever!

   "But," you say, "we have not received this kingdom yet." I answer that
   we have received it in a certain sense. We have received it, first, in
   the promise. Our Lord said, "I appoint unto you a kingdom as My Father
   has appointed unto Me." "Fear not, little flock, for it is your
   Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." Now, with a man's
   word, if he is a man of honor, we are content. We count his promissory
   note as the equivalent of the gold which he promises to pay. Let him
   set his hand to a promise and we pass it from hand to hand, regarding
   it as the thing, itself, which it promises. Shall we not think as much
   of the Word of God? The promise of God is so firm, so sure, so true,
   that inasmuch as He has promised a kingdom unto all them that wait for
   the appearing of His Son, that kingdom is ours--and by faith we

   grasp it this morning. Bless the Lord, we have received a kingdom! Let
   us worship Him in that spirit of thankfulness which such a gift should
   excite!

   More than this, we have received it in the principles of it, for it is
   written, "The kingdom of God is within you." As the fairest flower lies
   packed away within the little shriveled seed and needs but time and sun
   to develop all its beauty, so perfection, glory, immortality and
   unspeakable bliss lie slumbering and hidden away within the Grace which
   God has given to all His people. " He that believes in Him has
   everlasting life." The life of Heaven is begun within the Believer; it
   is germinating; it is daily developing--it shall, in God's good time,
   come to its absolute perfection! We have the kingdom within us--it is
   not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
   Spirit! The Spirit of God within a man is the earnest of Heaven and an
   earnest is of the same nature as that which it guarantees. We who are
   born unto God have the first fruits of the Kingdom of God in possessing
   the indwelling Spirit--and in the first fruits we see the entire
   harvest. Rise to this, my Brothers and Sisters, and under a sense of
   your immeasurable indebtedness go forth and serve your God with joyful
   thankfulness! This is the spirit in which to worship the Lord who has
   given us the kingdom!

   Moreover, in a measure we have received this kingdom in the power of
   it. Notice the text does not say we have received a little lordship, a
   small estate, a scanty portion, but we have received a kingdom. No gift
   less than this could content the great heart of our heavenly Father. He
   never stops half way in His march of mercy. He made us first His
   subjects, then His children, then His heirs and here He makes us kings,
   for every heir of God is heir-apparent to a throne! "He has made us
   kings and priests unto God, and we shall reign with Him." Brethren, in
   the Grace which God has given you, you received a measure of kingly
   power--you who have believed in Jesus have power over yourselves, power
   over your passions, power over the powers of evil--power, in measure,
   over your fellow men for their good!

   You also have power in prayer and what a real power is that, when a man
   can ask what he wills and it shall be done unto him! God has endowed
   you with power from on high by giving you the indwelling of the Holy
   Spirit! Thus you have received a kingdom in promise, in principle and
   in power! Moreover, you have received much of the provision and
   protection of that kingdom. You that are children of God are not left
   in the power of the enemy, but being redeemed, the Lord is a wall of
   fire round about you. You are garrisoned by angelic strength! You are
   led by unfailing wisdom! The all-sufficiency of God is your treasure
   house! The Lord has said, "No good thing will I withhold from them that
   walk uprightly." This is a royal charter of boundless liberality. "For
   all things are yours. Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the
   world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
   yours and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's." What royal provision
   is thus set apart for you! "All things work together for good to them
   that love God, to them that are the called according to His purpose."

   Everything is arranged for our benefit. There were two brothers, one of
   whom had been diligently attentive to his worldly business, to the
   neglect of true religion. He succeeded in accumulating considerable
   wealth. The other brother was diligent in the service of the Master and
   had learned both to distribute to the poor and, for conscience's sake,
   to forego many an opportunity of gain. When he lay sick and dying, he
   was in straitened circumstances. His brother somewhat upbraided him,
   remarking that if it had not been for his religion, he would not have
   been dependent upon others. With great calmness the saintly man
   replied, "Quiet! Quiet! O Tom, I have a kingdom not begun upon and an
   inheritance I have not yet seen."

   Speak of laying up for a rainy day--we have infinite goodness laid up
   for them that fear the Lord and none can rob us of it! Every child of
   God is as David when Samuel anointed him to a throne--he has a kingdom
   in reserve, secured by a Covenant of Salt! This kingdom which we have
   received has come to us by Grace alone. We could not have earned it, or
   merited it, or won it by our own strength. The Lord has given it to us
   in Christ Jesus. He has taken the beggar from the dunghill and set him
   among princes! He has lifted us up from the ruin of the Fall and
   redeemed us from the misery of our ungodly days! And He has enriched us
   with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus! Shall we not serve Him
   out of gratitude for such inestimable benefits? No crack of the whip
   shall drive us to His service, for we have not received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear.

   No fear of Hell, no hope of deserving Heaven shall urge us on to please
   our Lord. No, rather this shall be our song--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again With love intense I burn!

   Chosen of Him before time began, I choose Him in return."

   Gratitude is the only fountain of acceptable service! Without it the
   streams are far too defiled to flow in the Paradise of God. A large
   measure of the splendor of our kingdom lies in this, that it is a
   "kingdom that cannot be moved." Other kingdoms go to pieces sooner or
   later. You and I, who are in middle life, can remember kingdoms that
   have been blown down by the wind, or toppled over at the blow of one
   brave man's sword. Empires that have rivaled Caesar's in apparent
   strength have been swept down like cobwebs! As houses made of a pack of
   cards, so have dynasties fallen, never to rise again.

   There was one year in which our great caricaturist pictured kings and
   princes out at sea in little rowboats, tossed up and down by the wild
   waves of revolution, so frail was their tenure of power at that moment.
   Even today, I guarantee you, the last office I would choose would be
   that of an emperor in any country! A man might wisely prefer to take
   the post of a common crossing-sweeper rather than be a king, or even a
   president! As for the Empire of Russia, who would court its deadly
   honors? If those who deserve the most severe imaginable punishment for
   horrible crimes were compelled to be autocrats, it would be a
   punishment too heavy! What must he the strain upon the mind, the
   constant fear, the awful unrest of a man who has the sole control of
   millions and has deadly foes upon his track?

   Glory be to God, our kingdom cannot be moved! Not even dynamite can
   touch our dominion! No power in the world and no power in Hell can
   shake the kingdom which the Lord has given to His saints. With Jesus as
   our Monarch, we fear no revolution and no anarchy, for the Lord has
   established this kingdom upon a rock and it cannot be moved or removed!
   When the sun and moon are blown out in darkness and when the stars fall
   like the withered leaves of autumn, the kingdom in which we rejoice
   shall enjoy perpetual prosperity, as it is written, "Your kingdom is an
   everlasting kingdom and your dominion endures throughout all
   generations." Receiving such a kingdom, what are we bound to do? I
   would cast silver chains about you to hold you fast to your Lord! I
   would fasten anew these silken chains upon you to bind you to your God!
   You have received a kingdom! You can never pay back the millionth part
   of what you owe!

   Today, however, let the sweet love of Christ constrain you to judge
   that if He made you kings, it is for you to crown Him King with all
   your hearts! And if He has given you a kingdom that cannot be moved by
   you, it is for you to be "steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the
   work of the Lord." Is it not a splendid thought that when we do
   anything for God, though it is but the simple offering of a prayer, or
   the helping of a fatherless child, we may do it with all the holy
   dignity of princely priests? A certain set of men arrogate to
   themselves exclusively the title of priests and so deny the priesthood
   of every Believer. In this they act like Korah, Dathan and Abiram,
   thrusting themselves into an office which does not belong to them, and
   intruding out the true priests of the living God. Has not the Lord said
   to all His people, "You are a royal priesthood"?

   As for any who receive a supposed priesthood by laying on of hands of
   bishops, we know nothing of them except that they err, not knowing the
   true dignity of every Believer--they intrude into this priesthood so
   far as they pretend to possess priestly power beyond the lowest child
   of God, for they that believe in Jesus are, this day, made priests unto
   Him! With what sacred orderliness and saintly carefulness ought we to
   serve God because we serve Him not as common persons, if we are, indeed
   in Christ, but we worship Him as priests and kings! One of our early
   Saxon kings was rowed down the river Dee by Kenneth, of Scotland, and
   seven other vassal kings who, each one, tugged an oar while their lord
   reclined in state. The King of kings this day is served by kings--each
   man, each woman among us is made royal by the very fact of holy
   service! Let us labor for God not as slaves, but as kings!

   Alas, I confess that sometimes I have not served the Lord as a king. I
   have put on the ragged robes of my unbelief and I have come up here
   mourning and groaning when I ought to have arrayed myself in royal
   apparel and served my Lord with joy and gladness! Some of God's own
   saints forget what they are and where they are, and they go to His
   service as if it were a toil and a drudgery--laboring as if they were
   galley slaves--and not rejoicing as princes who wait upon a great King!
   Brethren, your high dignity should make you joyful and you should
   perform the Lord's service with intense delight because of what He has
   done for you! It should be Heaven upon earth to be allowed to do
   anything for Jesus! "Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which
   cannot be moved, let us have Grace, by which we may serve God
   acceptably."

   II. There is much to dwell upon in the first clause, but I must now
   turn to my second point. Acceptable service must

   be rendered to God IN THE POWER OF DIVINE GRACE. What says the Apostle?
   "Let us have Grace, by which we

   may serve God acceptably." Note, then, that acceptable service to God
   is not offered in the power of nature--not even of nature at its best
   when we call it good nature and philanthropy--but in the service of God
   everything must be the fruit of Grace! You are to serve the Lord, not
   in the strength of your own wit or experience, or talent, but in the
   energy of the new life which God has given you and in the power of the
   Grace which is continually bestowed upon you, moment by moment, as you
   seek it of the Lord. "Let us have Grace," says the Apostle.

   I know sometimes you say, and say truly, "What a poor creature I am.
   How can I serve God? I have not this and that gift." Just so, do not
   attempt to serve Him in the power of gifts. Ask for Grace and then
   worship Him in the power of Grace! It is wonderful how Grace can make
   use of very slender gifts and turn them to abundant account! It is
   great Grace that greatly honors God--and great Grace is always to be
   had by the least among us. You may never be an orator but you may have
   great Grace! You may never be an organizer and take the lead among your
   fellow Christians--but you may have much Grace. You may never attain to
   ample wealth so as to be able to distribute largely of your substance
   to the poor--but you may have great Grace. Therefore, let us have Grace
   that we may serve God acceptably!

   I should like to take these words out of their context and hang them up
   for our slogan as a Church--"LET US HAVE GRACE." Be this our prayer!
   Whatever else we do not have, Lord, let us have Grace! If this or that
   means of usefulness shall be denied us, yet let us have Grace. Grace in
   our hearts, Grace in our speech, Grace in our lives, Grace in our every
   breath! A true Christian should be like Aaron who had the holy oil not
   only on his head, but upon the skirts of his garments. Even in our
   little things, in our kitchen life, in our parlor life--something of
   the holy oil should be upon us! Abundance of Grace is our need.

   Now, dear Friends, have you been trying to serve God in the power of
   Grace, or in the power of nature? Look well to it. Only Grace can God
   accept--can He accept your labor? In the margin of our Testaments--I
   mean those of the authorized version which will never be parted with
   for the so-called revised version--in the margin of the authorized
   version we read, "Let us hold fast to Grace." That is another slogan I
   would like to give to this Church--"LET US HOLD FAST TO GRACE." To find
   Grace is an act. To have Grace is a state. To hold it fast is to make
   the act perpetual and the state continual! "Let us hold fast to Grace."
   There is such a thing as serving God and losing Grace while you are so
   doing. You may become like Martha, worried about your serving, and you
   may be cross with Mary because she does not work as you do, but
   preserves her heavenly communion.

   It is easy to have so much to do for Jesus that you lose Him amid your
   cares. It is possible to be busy, here and there, and to miss the
   essence of service by not holding fast to Grace. O to dip our feet in
   oil so that every step shall have unction with it and in every movement
   we shall hold fast to Grace! Now you may look at the new version if you
   like and in the margin you will find another reading which is
   allowable, though it has no great certainty about it. There we
   read--"Let us have thankfulness." That grand word, Charis or "Grace,"
   may be rendered, "thankfulness," and it is in a thankful spirit that we
   should serve God. You have received a kingdom, therefore serve God in
   the spirit of gratitude. Do everything because you feel you must do it
   since such an infinite amount of love has been lavished upon you.

   No one suggested to the holy woman in the Gospels to break her
   alabaster box over Jesus' head. It was her own thought and her own
   deed. Nobody even encouraged her to do it. Some rather looked askance
   upon her as she poured out the precious perfume, but she did it all for
   Jesus! She loved much, for much had been forgiven her. This is the true
   spirit of service! God keep us always filled with it! Let us have
   Grace! Let us hold fast to Grace! And in the power of these three
   sentences we shall be helped to "serve God acceptably, with reverence,
   and godly fear."

   III. But now, thirdly, we must advance another step. To "serve God
   acceptably" WE MUST DO IT WITH REVERENCE. These two words in the text
   are much mixed up in the various readings and it is almost impossible
   to divide the sense between them with accuracy. But yet I think I shall
   give the whole sense even if I do not allot a due proportion of meaning
   to each separate word. Acceptable serving or worshipping of God must be
   done with "reverence." The word, according to Bishop Hopkins, signifies
   a holy shamefacedness. The angels veil their faces with their wings
   when they worship the Most High and we must veil ours with humility!
   The angels feel their own littleness when they stand before the
   Presence of the dread Supreme.

   You and I who are much less than angels and have sinned--we, I say,
   should, when we come before God, be covered with blushes. Our heart
   should be filled with wonder that we are called to this high privilege
   though we are so unworthy of it. Let each one feel, "the Lord has made
   me a king; but what a marvel that this deed should be worked on me! Oh
   that I should be called to such a noble estate as this!" If some poor
   girl were suddenly called away from the milk pail and lifted from
   poverty and hard servitude to be the bride of a prince, the very
   thought of it would bring crimson to her cheeks! "Can it be?" she would
   ask. And I can imagine that when she was brought to court, there would
   be a noticeable bashful-ness and shamefacedness about her.

   Such holy shame ought to be upon us whenever we stand before the Lord
   to minister unto Him. Is it not said, "You shall be ashamed and
   confounded and never open your mouth any more"? Not because of a
   servile dread of God, but out of an overwhelming sense of His
   unutterable love we blush to be so highly favored! This reverence, this
   shamefacedness, should come upon us when we remember what we were. When
   you stand up in a Prayer Meeting and pray, dear Friends, some of you
   cannot help remembering the time when you could swear or sing a
   questionable song. You are accepted among your Brethren and honored by
   them, but the time was when you kept very different company--do you not
   blush as you think of it? You may not only think of what you were, but
   of what you are, because even now, though God favors you by allowing
   you to do Him service, yet you know what evil lurks within you! A very
   Hell of corruption lies within the best saint and if the Grace of God
   did not restrain it, he would soon be found among the chief of sinners!

   Moreover, bashfulness should be created not only by the thought of what
   you might be, but by a sight of your service, itself. Perhaps your
   fellow creatures are saying, "That is well done," but you will go home
   and lament to yourself, saying, "Ah, they do not know my faults. They
   little know what mean motives cropped up even when I was trying to
   glorify my God." "That was a fine sermon," said one to Mr. Bunyan. The
   good man answered, "You are too late, the devil told me that before I
   left the pulpit." Satan soon suggests to God's servants some lofty
   notion and they are tempted to appropriate to themselves the honor
   which belongs only to God! Ah, what a fool I am that even when I seek
   to be lowest at the feet of my Lord, I find myself satisfied with my
   humility!

   Do we not too often rather mimic humility than actually attain to it?
   Besides, it should always make us blush to think of the dignity of the
   service to which we are called, for who are we and what is our father's
   house that the Lord should have brought us to this? Servants of God!
   You Knights of the Garter! You princes of the blood royal! What are all
   your earthly honors when compared with the holy dignity of servants of
   the Most High? Oh, that in the spirit of lowly gratitude we may always
   serve the thrice-holy One!

   IV. The other word is, "and godly fear." And this suggests that we
   should serve God IN THE SPIRIT OF HOLY CHEERFULNESS. What sort of fear
   is this? For, "perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment."
   Observe that it is the fear that has torment which perfect love casts
   out--but not this godly fear which is quite consistent with our joy in
   receiving a kingdom! The more we have of this godly fear, the better
   for us. We ought to fear lest we should offend the Lord even while we
   are serving Him--fear lest the sacrifice should be a blemished one and
   so be rejected at the altar-- fear lest there should be something about
   our spirit and temper which would grieve the Lord. He is a jealous God
   and must be served with holy carefulness. O for more of it!

   I do not know how my Brethren feel who say they are perfect, but I am
   obliged to confess that when I would do good, evil is present with me,
   and that though I would serve God like a seraph, without one stray
   thought, or one selfish desire, yet I have by no means reached this
   attainment! I press forward towards the mark and hope to reach it, but
   it is, at present, far beyond me! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, much of
   holy fear should be upon us because we may so easily offend the Lord
   when we think we are pleasing Him! Beware of presumptuous boldness
   before God! Let us not be rash with our speech, much less rude and
   coarse. I know that modes of worship which offend my taste may,
   nevertheless, be accepted with God, because He sees through the rough
   shell and judges according to the sweet kernel. Yet I fear that
   thoughtless, bragging, noisy services must offend the Lord, for it is
   so unlike that which was offered by His gentle, tender, well-beloved
   Son.

   If Christ is the Model which He sets before us, some are far away from
   the mark! At any rate, let us never wantonly go into a wild, boisterous
   mannerism, for though we are the Lord's children and very near to Him,
   yet He is in Heaven and we are upon the earth. He is the thrice holy
   and we are sinners. The Psalmist says, "Serve the Lord with fear and
   rejoice with trembling." There is another form of godly fear which
   comes over every genuine Christian at times--the fear

   lest, after all, he should not be serving God at all. What if I have
   preached to others and should be, after all, merely preaching because
   it is my vocation? What if you should be teaching in the Sunday school
   and should be doing it only because it is customary for professing
   people of your station to have some good work to do? My dear Brothers
   and Sisters, it is not for me to doubt you and I do not doubt you half
   as much as I doubt myself, but it is necessary that we question
   ourselves as to whether we are, indeed, the servants of God, or are
   living for ourselves.

   Knowing that God is to be served in His own way and in that, alone,
   there ought to be a godly fear as to whether we are walking in His
   ordinances or are following the traditions of men. God does not care
   for worship which He has never required at our hands. If a man invents
   a ceremony, he may think it helpful and instructive, but he has no
   right to practice it if God has not appointed it. If any of you are
   practicing rites and ceremonies which are not according to God's Word,
   I charge you cease from such will-worship, for the spirit which leads
   you to practice these things is the spirit of Rome and of antichrist!
   If God has not commanded it, God cannot accept it!

   Not only are we to worship the true God, only, which is the Law of the
   First Commandment, but we must worship the true God in His own way,
   which is the spirit of the Second Commandment. The Second Commandment,
   as it forbids all worshipping of God through images, does, in the
   spirit of it, forbid all worshipping of God in any other way than He
   has prescribed. Therefore when you stand before the Lord, ask yourself,
   "Did He require this service of me? Is this the way in which He would
   be worshipped?" For if not, it is no better than idolatry and cannot he
   accepted by the living God! Oh, what fear and trembling, what solemn
   awe, what sacred carefulness should fall upon the man who draws near to
   serve and worship the Lord our God!

   V. Now, lastly, there is another thing to be remembered in acceptable
   services. We must cultivate A PROFOUND SENSE OF THE DIVINE HOLINESS and
   of the wrath of God against sin, "For our God is a consuming fire."
   Observe, then, from this most solemn sentence, that the God of the Old
   Testament is the God of the New Testament! Read Deuteronomy 4:24 and
   you will find these words, "For the Lord your God is a consuming fire,
   even a jealous God." The same words describe the God of the New
   Testament! I know the boasted wisdom of the age tells us that we have
   made a great advance upon Old Testament Revelation. It is not so. We
   may understand the Book somewhat better, but the Revelation is the
   same. God wears the same Character as in the days of Moses, David and
   the Prophets.

   The Lord God who is to be served by us, even as our Covenant God, is a
   "consuming fire." In love He is severely holy, sternly just. We hear
   people say--"God out of Christ is a consuming fire." That is an
   unwarrantable alteration of the text. The text is, "Our God," that is
   God in Christ is a consuming fire! "Our God" means God in Covenant with
   us. It means our Father God, our God to whom we are reconciled--even
   our God is still a "consuming fire." A large proportion of nominal
   Christians do not believe in this God. They profess reverence to a
   merciful God. But the moment you preach His justice, they are
   indignant! The God who is a consuming fire is not accepted by this
   proud "19th Century." I do this day most solemnly declare my faith in
   the God of the Hebrews who will, by no means, spare the guilty! The God
   of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is the one and only God and I declare Him,
   this day, to be my God!

   Jehovah is the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He
   be called! He that smote Pharaoh at the Red Sea. He that smote kings
   and slew mighty kings is my God and I believe in Him as the God and
   Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I know no God but Abraham's
   God, Jehovah, the I AM! Under the New Testament, God is not an atom
   less severe than under the Old. And under the Covenant of Grace the
   Lord is not a particle less righteous than under the Law. We are so
   saved by mercy that no sin goes unpunished--the Law is as much honored
   under the Gospel as under the Law! The substitution of Jesus as much
   displays the wrath of God against sin as even the flames of Hell would

   do!

   While the Lord is merciful, infinitely so, and His name is Love, yet
   still our God is a consuming fire and sin shall not live in His sight.
   If your offering and mine is evil, it will be an abomination unto Him.
   He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity! If our worship and service
   are mingled with hypocrisy and pride, He will not endure them. You will
   be rather surprised when I say that this dreadful sentence is my
   hope--it is a joy to me that our God is a consuming fire! Behold two
   altars upon Carmel. The Baalites have laid their victim upon one of
   them. Do you see them as they prance about the altar and even leap upon
   it? Do you hear them as they cry and cut themselves with knives and
   lancets? "O Baal, hear us! O Baal, hear us!" There lies the
   sacrifice--there is no trace of Baal's hearing them, for their god is
   not a consuming fire!

   Now comes Elijah. "Pour water," he says, "on the bullock. Do it a
   second time! Do it a third time." And they fetch up, from the sea, huge
   buckets and pour the water over everything until the trenches are
   filled with it. And now the Prophet lifts up his prayer to Heaven! Down
   comes the fire! It is God's sacrifice and God accepts it! He is a
   consuming fire and the token of His Presence is so manifest that the
   people cry, "Jehovah, He is the God, He is the God!" Turn your eyes,
   again, to Solomon's Temple gorgeous with gold and precious stones. The
   king pleads with the Lord of the whole earth to accept the shrine.

   Lo, the priests are present in their robes of office and the sacrifice
   is waiting on the altar. If no fire descends, there is no acceptance.
   But we read, "The fire came down from Heaven and consumed the burnt
   offering and the sacrifices; and the Glory of the Lord filled the
   house." If I am a true and sincere man. If I am believing in Jesus and
   I have brought my humble sacrifice with fear and reverence before God,
   then it will be accepted--for He is a consuming fire--and my sacrifice
   will be consumed and go up to Him! It may be some of you who have been
   working this week will think to yourselves, "We did very well, we hope
   to be honored for it." So you shall be--but if you take credit to
   yourselves, you will he robbing the altar of God! If God accepts your
   sacrifice, it will all be consumed by His fire. Look, the accepted
   sacrifice is all gone, it is utterly consumed!

   When God enables us to serve Him and takes away from us all
   self-congratulation, we ought to be very thankful. This proves that it
   is all burned with fire. If God had not accepted it, then we might have
   reserved portions of it for ourselves, to feed our vanity--and that
   would be to feed ourselves without fear. But if the Lord has taken
   every morsel from the mouth of self, we have great cause for rejoicing!
   If the Lord accepts us, His fire will consume us! The zeal of His House
   will eat us up! When we go home to the Lord above, we dread not His
   Presence, though He is a consuming fire. Those whom He has purified and
   made white are not afraid of the flames of His holiness!

   Remember that blessed text, "Who among us shall dwell with the
   devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burning? He
   that walks righteously and speaks uprightly. He that despises the gain
   of oppressions, that shakes his hands from the holding of bribes, that
   stops his ears from the hearing of blood and shuts his eyes from seeing
   evil; he shall dwell on high." It shall be the glory of the gracious
   and the true that God is their element! It shall be their bliss to live
   in the full splendor of His perfect holiness! They shall be like their
   Lord, for they shall see Him as He is. Everything that is holy will
   endure Your fire and as for all within us that is impure, let it be
   consumed speedily!

   So let us serve the Lord with fear, but not with terror. And let this
   service be continued all our days. Let us bring the sacrifices of the
   last week to Him, with repentance for every fault, humbly pleading that
   by His Grace He will accept it, and earnestly desiring that all we have
   done may redound to His Glory through Jesus Christ, His Son, to whom be
   honor, world without end! Amen.

The Touch

   (No. 1640)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JANUARY 8, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of
   Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched My clothes? And
   His disciples said to Him, You see the multitude thronging You, and do
   You say, Who touched Me?" Mark 5:30,31.

   WE just now read the story of this woman who was immediately healed.
   Spiritual persons know that the miracles recorded by the Evangelist are
   true because they have seen them reproduced. That is to say, we have
   not seen an issue of blood stopped by the touch of Christ's garments,
   but we have seen the spiritual counterpart of it. We have seen men and
   women healed of all kinds of spiritual and moral diseases by coming
   into contact with our Lord Jesus. They have touched Jesus and they have
   been made whole, for Jesus lives still and His healing work is not
   ended, but has only entered on another phase. Jesus has said, "Lo, I am
   with you always, even unto the end of the world." And, being with us,
   He is not here inactively or ineffectually, but He is here--the same
   yesterday, today and forever--to work the same miracles, only not on
   men's bodies, but on their souls.

   Jesus is present to heal leprosies of the mind and to open the eyes of
   the understanding. Yes, He is still among us to raise those who are
   dead in trespasses and sins. Though we live in a great leper house, yet
   are we comforted because we see that Jesus walks the hospitals and
   still heals on the right hand and on the left, all those who come into
   contact with Him. At the sight of His wonders of Grace, we cry out as
   they did in the days of His flesh, "He has done all things well!" As
   the miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ are pictures of His wondrous
   works in the spiritual kingdom, so are they instructive because they
   set forth much impressive and precious Truths of God most vividly.
   Tonight I have but one desire and that is to lead some poor sin-sick
   soul to Jesus. And I shall not be satisfied unless very many shall,
   this evening, for the first time, break through this crowd and press
   forward to touch the hem of Christ's robe and find immediate healing!

   I shall speak upon three things. First, upon this wonderful Person,
   who, if He is but touched, gives out a healing virtue. Secondly, upon a
   very able touch which is evidently a distinct thing from the touch and
   pressure of the eager, curious crowd. And then we will ask you to
   answer the singular personal question which the Savior puts to this
   assembly, "Who touched Me?" Perhaps there are some here, tonight, who
   will be able to say with trembling assurance, "I touched Him and He has
   made me whole." May the Holy Spirit cause it to be so!

   I. First, then, I have the blessed work, far beyond my power, but, oh,
   how sweet to my soul, of speaking upon THIS WONDERFUL PERSON. The Lord
   Jesus Christ, as He stood in the midst of the crowd, was charged with a
   power which is called by our translators, "virtue." An efficacious
   healing force was in Him. Sometimes He emitted it by words, frequently
   by the touch of His hands and, in this case, it seemed to stream, even,
   from His garments when He was but fitly and properly touched. He was
   charged with Omnipotent blessing and those who came into contact with
   Him were made whole! Do not think, dear Friends, that He is less full
   of benedictions for the sons of men tonight. No, if I may venture to
   say as much, He is more full of healing power, for He has bowed His
   head to death and worn the crown of thorns--and He has risen from the
   tomb and gone up into Glory leading captivity captive!

   In our midst at this moment He is, if it is possible, more charged with
   energy to bless than even when He walked the fields of Palestine and
   healed the feeble men and women of His time! Observe that Christ's
   power to bless lay mainly in the fact of His Deity. That humble, weary,
   way-worn Man was the Son of the Highest! Because He was still very God
   of very God, His will was Omnipotent. He did but speak to fever or
   leprosy and they went at His bidding--even as the centurion put it, "I
   am a man under authority and I say unto this man, Go, and he goes, and
   to my servant, Do this, and he

   does it." Even so, the Divine Christ did but will it and diseases fled
   at His bidding. He is not less Divine today. At this hour He cries,
   "Look unto Me and be you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am
   God, and there is none else."

   But His power to bless us lay, also, in the fact that He had become Man
   for our sake. I speak with lowly reverence, but "it behooved Christ to
   suffer." He found it necessary to be compassed with infirmities that He
   might save us from our infirmities. He was able to heal not only
   because He was God, but because He was Emmanuel, God With Us. Oh, the
   blessed mystery of the Incarnation! What a fount of mercy it is to us
   miserable sinners! He that spanned the heavens condescended to be
   wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger! He that bears up the
   pillars of the universe was, Himself, weary here below--and by His
   weakness gave us strength! Because He took our sicknesses, therefore is
   He able to deliver us from spiritual sickness and make us every bit
   whole. Oh, see, my Brothers and Sisters, God Incarnate present among
   us, "able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by Him."

   In addition to this, it is never to be forgotten that our blessed
   Master, being both Divine and Human, was also endowed with the Holy
   Spirit without measure. Often are we told in Scripture that He was able
   to do these mighty signs and wonders because the Holy Spirit was with
   Him. Even now that same Holy Spirit is with Him in plenitude of power.
   Jesus, whom I preach to you, the Man of Nazareth, the Mighty God, has
   the residue of the Spirit by which power He can remove from us
   sicknesses, the guilt and power of sin--and can make us perfectly
   whole, that is, holy! Is not this something to be delighted in--that
   there should be such a Savior--and such a Savior accessible tonight?
   The blessed Physician of souls can heal every sort of spiritual malady!

   I am able to say that I have seen Him heal such maladies. I think I
   have been witness to the cure of every sort of sin. At any rate, He is
   healing me of my own maladies and I am under His tender care, persuaded
   that He will make even me perfectly whole before He has done with me. I
   have seen the proud man, who could not otherwise have been cured of his
   haughtiness, come and sit at Jesus' feet and learn of Him until he has
   been made meek and lowly! I have seen the obstinate man come to Jesus
   and gladly take Christ's yoke upon him--and become willingly and
   joyfully obedient to the supreme will of Him who bought him with His
   blood! Often have I seen the unclean and the lascivious enticed to
   Jesus by His gentleness and they have been made pure!

   How often have these eyes seen the despairing that have been on the
   verge of madness cheered and comforted till they have sung for joy of
   heart! How frequently have I seen the coward made brave; the morose
   made gentle; the revengeful made forgiving by coming into contact with
   Jesus! You cannot love my Lord and love sin! You cannot trust my Lord
   and yet delight yourselves in iniquity! Only get near to Him and He
   will begin a cure upon your character and, before long, will perfect
   it! If your malady should be a delight in the pleasures and the
   pursuits of the world, He will teach you not to love the world, nor the
   things of it. Do you suffer from selfishness? He shall teach you to
   deny yourselves! His lance and nails and Cross shall crucify you with
   Himself till self-seeking shall die. Are you afflicted with a sloth
   that will not let you be active? My Master's zeal shall fire your soul
   till, like He, you shall be consumed with energy! I do not care what
   your fault is, my Brother or my Sister, but this I know--there is power
   in my Divine Lord and Master to redeem you from that fault! He can
   destroy evil and create good! Behold, He makes all things new!

   Ah, now, if I were addressing myself to a number of persons that were
   blind, or deaf, or sick and I told them that Christ was here to heal
   them of their bodily infirmities, what a rush there would be! Set Jesus
   up in Trafalgar Square to be touched by all manner of sick folk and I
   guarantee you the crowd would press one another to death in their
   eagerness to get at Him! But, surely, spiritual maladies are worse! It
   is worse to have a blind spiritual eye than a blind bodily eye. But men
   do not think so and, consequently, they are not anxious for spiritual
   health. I may praise up my Master, as I gladly would, even to the
   skies, and yet men will care nothing for Him, for they would just as
   soon be morally and spiritually sick as not--and some of them are even
   proud of their sicknesses!

   Well, what shall become of you? In that day when God shuts out the
   spiritually sick folk--the diseased, the pestilential, the putrid, the
   corrupt--when He casts them into Hell because they cannot be permitted
   to stand among His saints in His holy house in Heaven, whose fault
   shall it be that you were not healed? Who shall bear the blame that you
   died in your sins? Not the Lord Jesus Christ, but yourselves, because
   you chose your own delusions and would have none of Him!

   Thus have I feebly tried to set Him forth and oh, how I wished that you
   desired Him and longed for Him, for He is here and a touch of Him will
   save you! Poor Souls, must He pass you by?

   II. And now, secondly, I want to say a little, by God's help, about THE
   REMARKABLE TOUCH OF THIS WOMAN. Such a touch as hers may be given to
   Jesus at this good hour. We cannot, by our fingers, literally touch His
   cloak, but there is a spiritual touch that can still be given to Christ
   which will draw virtue out of Him so that all our spiritual diseases
   shall straightway be healed! This contact is not always described in
   Scripture as a touch--sometimes it is represented as hearing. "Incline
   your ear and come unto Me. Hear and your soul shall live." There is a
   link between you and me tonight in the fact that I speak and you hear.
   Well, a spiritual connection, of which this is the analogy--if it is
   set up between Christ and you--will cure you of your sin.

   Sometimes this contact is described as being formed by a look. This is
   the favorite example. "Look unto Me and be you saved, all you ends of
   the earth." It is apparently a very meager connection which is set up
   by a glance--and yet if you have such a contact between you and Christ
   as the eye made between the dying Israelite and the brazen serpent, it
   will save you! Here in this narrative the contact is symbolized by a
   touch. The patient, by her touch, was linked with Jesus and felt in her
   body that she was healed of her plague. Now, do you not wish to touch
   Jesus and to be made whole, that is, holy? If you do, remember that the
   touch must be a voluntary one!

   If any of you were brought into a supposed connection with Christ when
   you were children, without consciousness of what was done, I charge
   you, do not put any confidence in the ceremony! Religion performed for
   you, when you were unconscious and gave no consent to it, cannot
   possibly save you! Whatever there might be in it, there is nothing
   saving in it! You must come into a voluntary union with Jesus if you
   would be made whole. It must be an intentional contact. Some were
   pressed against the Savior as they pushed against each other and as the
   crowd surged to and fro--but this woman was not driven against Christ
   without her consent. Oh no, she was eager to get at Him! She pushed!
   She struggled and, at last, she reached the fringe of His mantle and a
   contact was established intentionally by her finger. She wished to be
   made whole and she touched Christ with that view.

   You, too, must come to Jesus with the view of being delivered from the
   guilt, penalty and power of sin. And you must get into contact with
   Christ with the intent that He should be your Savior. I entreat you to
   see to this and may the Holy Spirit lead you to do it at once. "Oh,"
   you say, "but I do not know how to get into contact with the Savior."
   The best way, the only way, is by believing in Him. If you, tonight,
   say in your heart, "I trust Christ to save me," there is, immediately,
   a contact between you and Christ of the right kind--you are the
   trusting one and He is the Person trusted in. There is a point of union
   between you and Christ and this will save you--for there never was
   anyone, yet, that did wholly trust the blood and righteousness of Jesus
   without finding himself fully justified in so trusting! The rule of the
   kingdom is--"According to your faith so be it unto you."

   If your faith is only as a grain of mustard seed, if it is genuine
   faith, it shall work in you the cure of your soul's disease and you
   shall live unto righteousness! The point of contact is a main
   consideration and I pray you look to it. Do you not see that when the
   woman's finger touched Christ's garment, there was established, at
   once, a connection between the two, along which the Divine virtue
   flashed? I will not illustrate this by electricity, for such a figure
   will suggest itself to you all--but the fact is that faith sets up a
   contact between the sinner and Christ--and through this the healing
   virtue comes to us. Faith on our part is an act of reception. We agree
   to receive Christ as what God has made Him to be--a Propitiation for
   sin. We accept Him as our Savior, Teacher, Leader, Ruler--and in all
   these senses He is ours.

   Whatever God the Father says that Jesus is, we agree that He is that
   and we take Him to ourselves to be all that to us. Especially since He
   has come to save His people, we accept Him as our Savior. I have
   sometimes quoted to you the words of Luther who often put a Truth of
   God so broadly that he overshadowed other Truths of God and uttered
   language which would not bear to be closely looked into, though most
   fit to set forth his immediate meaning. Luther says, "I will have
   nothing to do with saving myself! Jesus Christ is a Savior--I leave my
   soul wholly in His hands." That puts it very broadly, but it is what I
   mean within a little, that is to say, you must just go and say, "I
   cannot deliver myself from the power of sin, but I know that Jesus can
   deliver me and I put myself into His hands that He may do it."

   When faith thus unites us to Jesus, the healing virtue will flow from
   Him to us. "Oh, well," says one, "I have often heard you preach about
   being saved from sinning by Christ, but I do not feel that I can do
   anything." Just so. That is why I want you to get Christ to work in you
   and for you. "Oh, but I am nobody." That is the very sort of person I
   delight to find, that Jesus Christ may make you into somebody and say,
   "Somebody has touched Me." Nobody is made into somebody when he once
   touches Jesus Christ! "Oh, but I am_." There will be no end to these
   objections and, there-

   fore, let me say plainly, never mind what you are! The question is,
   What is the Lord Jesus Christ? If He is able to save you, trust Him,
   rely upon Him, rest your soul with Him!

   Did I hear one reply, "I do not see how that will make me better"? My
   speedy answer is that faith, simple as it seems, is the one thing
   which, by God's Grace, shall make you a new man! Here is the philosophy
   of it--If you trust Jesus, you will love Him. If you love Him, you will
   serve Him. Believing that Jesus has saved you, gratitude springs up in
   your heart and becomes the motive power by which a new life is begun
   and continued. I pray you try it! I remember years ago when I tried the
   power of faith in Jesus. It was a poor, feeble, trembling touch that I
   gave to Christ, but by it from sadness and despair I rose to gladness
   and hope! I had something to live for and I had the expectation of
   being able to accomplish it, too, when I had touched Him!

   And at this hour, when I am sick and sad and sorry and sinful, I go to
   Him and I am blest. If I need washing, He must wash me. If I need
   clothing, He must clothe me. If I need strength, He must invigorate me.
   He is All-in-All to my soul and so I do but tell you what I know myself
   and persuade you, by my own experience, to Him.

   III. Lastly, the poor woman, having touched the hem of Christ's garment
   and being made whole, was about to sneak away when the Master asked THE
   REMARKABLE QUESTION which brought her to the front, so that she was
   obliged to confess what Christ had done for her. I would to God that
   all of you who have felt the power of Christ would bear testimony to
   the fact! As a rule, those who have been converted in this place have
   not been backward to confess Christ, but still, some among you who love
   my Lord have never yet avowed your attachment to Him. You are on
   Christ's side, but you do not wear His uniform and acknowledge His
   cause. You have not acknowledged Him, though He has promised that those
   who do so, He will confess at the last.

   We are all too fond of ease and so it happens, in this world of ours,
   that much of the force of goodness remains unused because men are
   inactive and retiring. Who covets the front of the battle? Only a bold,
   brave man whose heart God has touched! He comes to the front and
   remains the butt of opposition when prudence might dictate that he
   should shelter himself from the conflict. Oh, my dear Friend, if you
   love Jesus Christ, my Master, I ask you never to be ashamed to be on
   His side and on the side of the right and the true, the just and the
   kind! Take your place like a man and avow yourself a soldier of the
   Cross! Too many are like the timid woman of our text--they receive
   benefits from Jesus and then try to lose themselves in the crowd.

   I will tell you a little about that. The touch that brings virtue out
   of Christ is one that cannot be perceived by our fellow men. That young
   man over yonder touched Christ tonight, but he who sits close to him is
   not aware of it. The saving act is done in secret and sometimes it is
   almost a secret to the person himself! He hardly dares to think that he
   has been so bold. This poor woman shrank into herself--she knew that
   she was cured--but she was afraid to think of what she had done to get
   the cure! I have known many poor souls believe in Christ and yet feel
   as if it were presumption to do so! It appears, to a truly humbled
   conscience, to be so great a mercy to be forgiven that it feels hardly
   justified in daring to think that Jesus could have put away its sins!

   Listen to me, you who are trembling! Let not your fears rob your Lord
   of His honor! You must confess your faith, for Jesus loves that those
   whom He heals should acknowledge it. That is why He turned round and
   said, "Who touched My clothes?" He delights in that tender
   acknowledgment, wet with many tears. If you have done good to one of
   your neighbors, you think it ungrateful if no word of thanks is spoken.
   I have known benevolence almost shriveled up for lack of gratitude! My
   Master is not of such a temper, but still, He welcomes words of humble
   acknowledgment. He loves to hear the bleating of the sheep which His
   shoulders have brought back to the fold. He loves that much love comes
   of having much forgiven. Do not, then, hold your tongue! If Jesus has,
   indeed, healed you, tell Him of it and tell His people of it to His
   praise.

   Such Grace ought to be known. Is there anything to be ashamed of? For
   my part I glory in being saved by Christ. If he that is a Christian is
   a fool, write me down among the fools! Say you not so, poor working
   Brother? When you go into the workshop and they say, "These Christian
   people are a set of hypocritical Presbyterians," will you not answer,
   "Then put me down among them"? If your Lord and Master did not grudge
   to stand in the pillory for you till they spit in His face, what a
   coward you must be if you always draw back from avowing your faith in
   Him from the fear of ridicule! If He acknowledged your cause even unto
   death, never blush to be regarded as His follower! Let every cowardly
   thought be

   banished from your spirit! If Jesus saved you from going down into the
   Pit and made you a new creature, never be ashamed, in any company, to
   say, "Christ has made me whole and, therefore, I am His."

   From that day, the healed woman and Jesus had instituted a friendship
   that never ended--they had conversed together and their lives were
   openly linked together. Would you not wish the same thing to happen to
   you? To this woman Christ said, "Go in peace." What a blessing she
   gained by being fetched out of her hiding place, for had she gone away
   without an open confession, she might often have been disturbed in mind
   by the fear that a stolen cure would not be permanent. The Master said,
   "Go in peace," and a profound calm fell upon her spirit, as when the
   sea birds sit on the waves and all the winds have fallen into a deep
   sheep! She was a happy woman from that day, for Jesus had said, "Go in
   peace," and what could trouble her?

   Now, it may be that some of you who love Christ will go to Heaven
   safely enough. But you will miss a mint of comfort on the road because
   you have never openly confessed that you belong to Christ. Perhaps
   certain of you will never get peace till you acknowledge your
   discipleship and link your whole life with Jesus. When you do that and
   take up His Cross with all its shame--and are known to be a Christian
   in every society into which you enter--then shall your peace be like a
   river. I have done, only I would put to the whole congregation the
   question, "Who has touched Christ tonight?" O that some would answer in
   their hearts, "I have touched Him tonight by faith." Why should you not
   all trust the appointed Savior?

   Do you tell me that you do not understand what faith is? It is
   trusting--trusting wholly upon the Person, work, merit and power of the
   Son of God. Some think this trusting to be a strange business, but,
   indeed, it is the simplest thing that can possibly be! To some of us,
   Truths of God which were once hard to believe are now matters of fact
   about which we should find it hard to doubt! If one of our grandfathers
   were to rise from the dead and come into the present state of things,
   what a deal of trusting he would have to do! He would say, tomorrow
   morning, "Where are the flint and steel? I need a light." And we should
   give him a little box with tiny pieces of wood in it and tell him to
   strike one of them on the box. He would have to trust a good deal
   before he would believe that fire would thus be produced!

   We would next say to him, "Now that you have a light, turn that tap and
   light the gas." He sees nothing but is annoyed with an offensive smell.
   How can he believe that light will come of that invisible vapor? And
   yet it does. "Now come with us, Grandfather. Sit in that chair. Look at
   that box in front of you. You shall have your likeness directly." "No,
   child," he would say "it is ridiculous! The sun take my portrait? I
   cannot believe it!" "Yes, and you shall ride 50 miles in an hour
   without horses!" "I do not believe it," he says. "What is more, you
   shall speak to your son in New York and he shall answer you in a few
   minutes." Should we not astonish the old gentleman? Would he not need
   all his faith?

   And yet these things are believed by us without effort because
   experience has made us familiar with them. Faith is greatly needed by
   you who are strangers to spiritual things. You seem lost while we are
   talking about them and our very words puzzle you. But oh, how simple it
   is to us who have the new life and have communion with spiritual
   realities. We have a Father to whom we speak and He hears us! And we
   have a blessed Savior who hears our heart's longing and helps us in our
   struggles against sin. It is all plain to him that understands!

   May the Spirit of God bring every one of you to understand it! What a
   joy it would be if we all touched the Savior, should all be healed of
   sin and all be admitted to stand at His right hand forever! Then,
   whoever we may be and however much we may differ in rank and talent, we
   shall all heartily join to sing the new song, "Worthy is the Lamb that
   was slain, to receive honor and glory forever and ever, Amen."

   EXPOSITION Mark 5:21-43.

   Verses 21, 22--And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the
   other side, many people gathered unto Him: and He was nigh unto the
   sea. And, behold, there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue,
   Jairus by name; and when he saw Him, he fell at His feet.

   Paying our Lord respect and deference, as was His due. See here an
   instructive sight--the Law at the feet of the Gospel! This is the place
   for the Law. The best work the Law can do is to bring us to the feet of
   Jesus! The elder had an ear-

   nest request to make and, therefore, he put himself into a lowly
   suppliant position. We, too, shall succeed in prayer when we plead with
   all humility, bowing in the dust before the Lord.

   23, 24--And besought Him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at
   the point of death: I pray You, come and lay Your hands on her, that
   she may be healed; and she shall live. And Jesus went with him; and
   many people followed Him, and thronged Him.

   We are told elsewhere that this was his only daughter and 12 years of
   age. All the father's heart was set upon her. His life was wrapped up
   in the child's life. She was now in extremis. She must die unless the
   great Teacher will come and raise her up to health, again. There was
   faith in this ruler and, therefore, we read, "And Jesus went with him."
   Faith ensures the aid of Jesus without delay and if you and I can trust
   Him, He will go with us. Friend, can you rely on Jesus? Then shall it
   be written of you, also, "And Jesus went with him." 25--And a certain
   woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years.

   In this passage of our Lord's life, He blesses two women--the damsel
   sick unto death and the matron sorely diseased. A large portion of the
   cures that Jesus worked were upon men, but those worked upon women are
   nearly all specially noteworthy. Surely, of miracles of a spiritual
   kind, the women have a double share. This poor woman had been a
   sufferer for 12 years, that is to say, just as long as the damsel had
   lived. How many only live to suffer--their existence being little
   better than a protracted wasting away!

   26, 27--And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
   all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse. When
   she had heard of Jesus, she came in the press behind and touched His
   garment.

   "When she had heard of Jesus." "Faith comes by hearing." My dear
   Hearers, whatever you do not hear, take care that you hear much of
   Jesus! Some preach the Church--it were better, by far, if they preached
   the Church's Head. Some preach up a creed--it were wiser to proclaim
   Him who is the Essence of the creed! Attend those places where most is
   said of Christ, for it is by hearing of Him that you will be blest as
   this poor woman was. That which she heard brought her to Jesus and
   coming to Jesus is the great thing to be desired! When she had heard of
   Jesus, she determined to obtain for herself the healing which He was
   able to bestow. Have you no such resolve?

   28-- For she said, If I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole.

   Not. "If I may but touch His clothes," as if she meant to lay stress on
   the mere touch. The translators were wise to place the "but" after the
   "touch," for there the emphasis rests. The woman believed that Jesus
   was full of healing energy everywhere--even in His garments--and,
   therefore, she felt--"If I may touch but His clothes, I shall thus come
   into contact with Him and I shall be whole." Nor did she rest content
   with theory--she carried it out into act--she pressed through the
   throng and touched the border of His garment as Luke informs us. O that
   all good intentions were as promptly turned into actions!

   29-- And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she
   felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. "Straightway."
   Mark is very fond of that word, "straightway," or, "immediately." And
   truly the instantaneous

   action of our Lord at the call of faith is so remarkable that we do not
   wonder that the Evangelist should record it! Are there not sick souls
   here who would gladly obtain an immediate salvation? A touch of Jesus
   will win it! 30, 31--And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that
   virtue or power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and
   said, Who touched My clothes? And His disciples said to Him, You see
   the multitude thronging You, and do You say, Who touched Me?

   Peter led the way in this remark, acting as the spokesman for the rest.
   Jesus is always right, even when, to the eye of sense, He appears to be
   wrong. We ought never to suspect Him of making a mistake! Indeed, for
   us to question Him would be great presumption.

   32-- And He looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

   He knew who it was; evidently He looked for "her." He looked round, not
   to make a discovery of what was unknown, but to look on one whom He
   would gently bring out of her hiding place. Taking a long and steady
   gaze around the multitude, He at last singled her out.

   33-- But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
   her, came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth.

   Here is another instructive sight. Just now we saw the Law at Christ's
   feet and here we have a needy sufferer at Christ's feet. What a
   picture! If the ruler of the synagogue had a right to be at Jesus'
   feet, much more this poor healed one who owed everything to Him. Oh,
   you that have been saved by Jesus, worship Him! Fall at His feet with
   reverence! Sit there with attention and abide there in obedience.

   34, 35--And He said unto her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole;
   go in peace, and the whole of your plague. While He yet spoke, there
   came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Your
   daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?

   The word for "trouble," is a very strong one, as if they judged it to
   be exacting on the ruler's part to take the Savior to his house. Surely
   it implies that there were such signs of weariness upon our Lord that
   friendly minds judged it to be troubling Him to induce Him to struggle
   through the crowd to the house. Sometimes these side lights reveal more
   of the condition of the Man of Sorrows than the narrative actually
   records. Ah, there is no fear of troubling Jesus, now--it is His joy to
   visit where He is prayed to come!

   36--As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said unto the
   ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

   As much as to say--"That is all you can do and all you need do. Just
   trust Me. Be not staggered if death, itself, is there. I am greater
   than death." Would our Lord have spoken thus if He had not been
   conscious of infinite power, conscious, indeed, of His Deity? How can
   any say, some among you, that He is not the Son of God? Assuredly He
   speaks the language of Omnipotence! These are not the words of a mere
   man! Hear them and practice them--"Be not afraid. Only believe."

   38-- And He suffered no man to follow Him, save Peter, and James, and
   John the brother of James. And He went to the house of the ruler of the
   synagogue and saw the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

   That is to say, the hired mourners who came there to mimic sorrow.
   Everything false and hired must go out when Jesus enters to work his
   wonders.

   39-- And when He was come in, He said unto them, Why make you this ado
   and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleeps. She was not dead for good
   and all. He knew that she was dead for the time, but He spoke broadly,
   looking at the

   future. And in His sense she was not dead, since in a few moments she
   would be among them alive. Her brief death was, in effect no death, but
   a mysterious sleep.

   40-- And they laughed Him to scorn.

   How this sentence ought to encourage any who, in doing right, meet with
   disgrace and reproach! "They laughed HIM to scorn." Will you ever think
   it hard that you should be ridiculed when the Lord, the Prince of
   Glory, is laughed to scorn? No, my Brothers and Sisters, say in your
   hearts--

   "If on my face for Your dear name

   Shame and reproaches be,

   All hail reproach and welcome shame,

   If You remember me." 40--But when He had put them all out.

   And here is another flash of Deity. Did you ever notice how the Lord
   Jesus frequently does things which are perfectly unaccountable if
   performed by a mere man, as when He went into the Temple and cleared
   out the buyers and sellers with a scourge of small cords? And when, in
   Gethsemane, He only said, "I am He," and they fell backward? Here,
   again, He put out of the room all the minstrels and hired mourners.
   Does it not show that occasionally a majesty flashed from the human
   Person of Christ which overwhelmed everybody and was perfectly
   irresistible? Yes, in His deepest humiliation, our Lord had a Glory
   about Him which revealed the indwelling God!

   40-- He took the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that
   were with them, and entered in where the damsel was

   lying.

   Christ and death--together in one room! A grand picture! Look at the
   pale, dead child and the life-giving Lord. We know what the issue will
   be when our Lord enters the lists with the last enemy!

   41-- And He took the damsel by the hand.

   That chill, motionless hand! See how the maiden lies before Him like a
   dew-laden lily wet with the damps of death! 41--And said unto her,
   Tabitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto you,
   arise.

   He spoke to her in her own dear mother tongue. How sweet to be recalled
   to life by sounds which were so familiar! There is something homely
   about all the calls of heavenly love.

   42, 43--And straightway the damsel arose and walked, for she was of the
   age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
   astonishment. And He charged them that no man should know it.

   He did not wish to have this miracle published. There were reasons why,
   just then, there should not be much noise made by His miracles.
   Besides, our blessed Savior was ever gentle and modest, as it is
   written, "He shall not strive or cry, or cause His voice to be heard in
   the streets." He sought not honor of men. Let us do nothing with the
   view of its being blazoned abroad.

   43--And commanded that something should be given her to eat.

   This command is natural enough, but how singularly it follows a
   miracle! Could not He who gave her back to life have satisfied her
   appetite without food? Yes, but Jesus is always cautious of His
   miracles, and this is the mark of the true Christ. Look at antichrist
   and see her lavish marvels at Lourdes and a thousand
   shrines--shovelfuls of them! Paul speaks of these signs and lying
   wonders as the trademark of the mystery of iniquity! But the Christ
   works no needless miracle-- He pauses where the need of the
   supernatural ceases.

   He also teaches us this lesson, that when He gives spiritual life, it
   is our duty to furnish it with suitable nutriment of the Divine Truth
   of God. We should teach and console those who are newly born into the
   household of faith! Especially is this the duty of parents and those
   who are our fathers in the Church. Let us not fail to obey our Lord's
   precept and may God thus bless the reading of his Word to us.

Great Spoil

   (No. 1641)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 22, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I rejoice at Your Word, as one that finds great spoil." Psalm 119:162.

   IN the preceding verse David had avowed his reverence for God's Word in
   the following language--"My heart stands in awe of Your Word." It is
   clear that holy awe is perfectly consistent with intense delight. Fear
   seems to stand far apart from joy and yet, in the experience of the
   child of God, they are next of kin. We are familiar with combinations
   such as this--"They returned from the sepulcher with fear and great
   joy." "Happy is the man that fears always." "Serve the Lord with fear
   and rejoice with trembling." These two emotions are like two notes
   which, apart, are widely different, but sound harmoniously
   together--the one is far down and the other is high up in the
   scale--but they melt into one with sweet accord in the experience of
   God's people. It is a blessed thing both to reverence the Word of God
   and to have an intense joy in it. May we all know what the mixed
   emotion means.

   More than this, I will go the length of saying that unless we do have
   deep awe of the Word, we shall never have high joy over it. Our
   rejoicing will be measured by our reverence. If I think upon the Bible,
   as some seem to do, as though it were an ordinary piece of literature,
   I shall have no very special joy in it. Or if I rise no higher than
   many critics of the present day and conceive the Holy Book to be, in a
   certain sense, Inspired, but still to be marred with imperfection and
   open to rectification by the growing intelligence of the age--if I have
   such small reverence for the Word of God, I shall have a
   correspondently little joy in it.

   A man rejoices in gold rather than in clay because the gold is more
   precious and, as the treasure rises in value, so his delight in it will
   rise. The more, then, we think of the Scriptures, the greater will be
   our delight in them if we see that they relate to us. "Your Word is
   very pure: therefore Your servant loves it." If they become to us the
   Infallible voice of Truth, that pure light which never misleads, that
   metal which is entirely free from alloy--then will our joy in Holy Writ
   overflow as we read in it the mind and will of our Father in Heaven!
   And then shall we borrow the language of the Psalmist, saying first,
   "My heart stands in awe of Your Word," and next, "I rejoice at Your
   Word, as one that finds great spoil."

   Observe, dear Friends, concerning this joy of David in the Word of God
   which he reverenced, that he expresses it with a martial figure. My
   text is quite a soldierly verse--"I rejoice at Your Word, as one that
   finds great spoil." It is a figure taken from men of war who, after
   they have overcome their enemy, divide the plunder among them. This
   expression is most natural as coming from David. David had been a
   soldier from his youth up and he knew personally and literally what it
   was to divide the spoil and, therefore, he did not go far to find his
   metaphor, but plucked it from the garden of his own life! How I like to
   hear men both in prayer and praise speak like themselves!

   I notice that if a sailor has been converted to God, he can, in cool
   blood, utter proper sentences, such as one might borrow from collects
   and forms of prayer. But if his soul grows warm within him, he ceases
   to speak according to the books and begins to pray like an "ancient
   mariner." When he breaks through the bonds of restraint and gets quite
   free, he takes you among the rolling billows and many of his
   expressions have a salt spray upon them, possibly also a suspicion of
   yarn and pitch! You soon find that you have fallen in with a shipmate
   whose soul has done business on the great waters.

   So must it be with the soldier. If cold, dead propriety rules him, you
   will not know whether he is a soldier or a citizen. But let him grow
   enthusiastic! Let his very heart speak out and his speech betrays him!
   Wars and rumors of wars are in his utterances. He sings and prays to
   martial music! Therefore I like to hear David saying that his heart
   rejoices at God's Word as one that finds great spoil, for it is his own
   manner of speech and sounds fitly from a warrior! Do not cut away the
   naturalness of yours utterances in prayer--never grow so strictly
   proper as to pray like somebody else. You

   may take a bird and teach it to pipe half-a-dozen set notes and it will
   be thought to be a wonder--but no piping bullfinch in the world, to my
   ear, sings so sweetly as the finches in my own garden, whose wild songs
   are all their own.

   The labored notes of the trained bird's little tune may be remarkable,
   but are they not also somewhat grotesque and unnatural? The notes of
   Nature more truly reveal the bird and are a fitter utterance for it
   than the ditty it has learned so painfully. It is a pity that men
   should speak with God in a constrained and artificial style--it far
   more befits them to pray in their own natural manner! If you are
   farmers, or artisans, or laborers, be not ashamed that your speech
   should savor of yours calling. If you are soldiers, pray like soldiers!
   Let your true selves speak out when you speak with God, for He is
   Truth, itself, and needs not that you put on artificial manners in His
   Presence!

   Having thus prefaced my discourse, I come to look into this joy of
   David over God's Word which he compares to the joy of a warrior when he
   finds great spoil. To such overflowing joy we are not strangers--we
   feel quite at home with the text.

   I. Let me first observe that THIS GREAT JOY IS SOMETIMES AROUSED BY THE
   FACT THAT THERE IS A WORD OF GOD. This is true if we regard the
   Scriptures as a revealing of God. After going up and down in the world
   searching after Deity, it is a great delight to come upon a Book in
   which the one only living and true God has unveiled Himself to those
   who care to behold Him. It is a great "find" for a man to discover
   that, after all, he is not left in a fog to grope his way, but that God
   has kindled a sun that honest hearts may walk in the light of and in
   that light see all things clearly. I say that a Revelation of God is a
   great discovery over which a man rejoices "as one that finds great
   spoil." For, dear Friends, there can be no revealing of God except by
   God Himself.

   The Apostle Paul tells us very truly that the things of a man know no
   man but the spirit of a man that is in him. You cannot read a man until
   that man brings out somewhat from within and thus reveals himself. A
   man must speak, or act, or we cannot know his mind. The chief means of
   a man's revealing himself is by his word--language is the gate of the
   soul. If the man is true and honest, his word will be a window through
   which you may see his mind. Even so, says the Apostle, as the heart of
   a man is only known to the man, himself, so the things of God knows no
   man but the Spirit of God. The Divine thought must be hidden in the
   heart of God forever until the Spirit of God is pleased to tell it to
   us.

   There is, therefore, an absolute necessity for a Revelation, since none
   can, by searching, find God. This written Word is the Revelation of God
   and when the Spirit of God shines upon it, we see the Lord as in a
   mirror. Oh, but what a blessing that the Spirit of God should still be
   with His people, bearing witness with the Word of God which He has of
   old Inspired! What a comfort that we have this sure Word of Testimony
   in which God has spoken to us in terms so distinct, so clear, so
   unquestionable! He who feels the power of this Revelation in his own
   soul may well rejoice "as one that finds great spoil."

   Nor does our valuation of Holy Scripture depend upon this one view of
   it, for we also prize it as the guide of our life. Often we come to
   positions in which we know not which way to take. It is a great
   discomfort to have to be questioning, questioning and forever
   questioning! To hear within the soul the enquiries, "How?" "What?"
   "Which?" "When?" and to be confused by dubious voices is a great
   affliction--suspense is killing. How delightful to turn over the sacred
   page and find in them a guide like that of the Urim and Thummim of old!
   This Book tells us the right and bids us follow it! It teaches us the
   way of wisdom and the path of understanding and it supplies motives for
   walking in them. Submitting ourselves to the Spirit of God, we hear Him
   speak in this volume and say, "This is the way, walk you in it."

   As a bewildered wanderer in a forest hails the light in a cottage
   window, hoping to find a guide there to set him on his homeward path,
   so do we hail the light of Holy Writ which shines in a dark place. As
   the mariner prizes his chart and compass, so do we welcome the Law of
   the Lord. Tossed on the changing sea of life, our eyes are gladdened by
   the clear ray of this pole-star of Heaven, the fixed Light of God! If
   we had been left to blind reason, we would soon have stumbled into the
   ditch--but with Inspiration to conduct us, we have a plain path before
   us and we are glad. No longer in a perpetual quandary, guessing and
   surmising, the way of life is definitely mapped out for us and we
   pursue our route with confidence, knowing that, "Blessed are the
   undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord." This becomes
   our daily song, "You shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterward
   receive me to Glory." O happy man that finds such sure direction as
   this! He can rejoice "as one that finds great spoil."

   More than this, if you think of it, dear Friends, a word from God
   apprehended in the soul is a sure pledge of mercy. Consider what words
   those Words of God are--how full of love, Grace and tenderness. I will
   not stay to quote the ex-

   ceedingly great and precious promises, for they are, I hope, your daily
   food. You know what great things the Lord has spoken concerning you.
   But here is a thought worth pondering--these promises are backed by the
   Word of God--no, they are, each one, the Word of God! When a man has
   given his word, if he is an upright, honorable man, there is an end to
   further questions--he has pledged his word and that is enough. Now the
   Lord has given to His people His Word-- His right honorable Word that
   cannot be broken--which must stand fast forever and ever. Happy are
   those who are willing to take God at His Word and accept His promise as
   the equivalent for the thing promised, for what the Lord has promised
   He will surely perform!

   When a man grasps a promise of forgiveness, of acceptance in prayer, of
   sanctifying Grace, of daily Providence, of Divine anointing, of comfort
   in death, or of eternal Glory, he may well rejoice "as one that finds
   great spoil." Within the Word of promise there lies the blessing,
   itself! The Word is to the apprehension of faith, the substance of the
   thing hoped for. That which is guaranteed by God--who cannot lie--is
   already ours! Well may he rejoice that finds it! Notice, still further,
   that Holy Scripture, when it comes to us with power as the Word of God,
   is the beginning of communion with God. It will strike you in a moment
   that when the Lord speaks to a man, communion has, in a measure, begun.

   It may be that God speaks to a deaf ear, but even then it shows great
   goodness and condescension on God's part that He should speak to men at
   all, and especially to those who refuse to hear Him! But oh, if you
   actually hear the voice of God in His Word--if it sinks into your soul
   by the accompanying power of the Holy Spirit--what remains, then, but
   for you to answer the Lord and to let Him speak again? This Bible
   talks--"When you awake, it shall talk with you." This is God's side of
   a heavenly conversation which ought to be kept up throughout all the
   days of our pilgrimage. God says this and that in the Word and we in
   prayer, in faith, in holy action reply to Him--and then He speaks again
   and we answer Him again.

   When you are alone and wish to have communion with God, you probably
   begin with prayer. Do so. But sometimes you feel that you cannot pray.
   Very well, do not try. Say, "I desire to converse with God but if I
   cannot speak I will listen to Him speak." Get down the Bible. Read a
   Psalm, or some precious portion of Holy Writ, and after God has thus
   spoken to you, the conversation has begun! God's Words will suggest
   heart-words with which you can speak to the Most High. If it does not,
   read some more, till at last, within your spirit there is communion
   with the Eternal One. Oh, what a bliss it is that God does speak to any
   of us--to me--a poor, worthless, sinful creature! How highly favored is
   man to have a word from the great King!

   Many would give their eyes to be spoken to by a monarch, but here we
   are spoken to daily by the King of kings if we are but willing to
   incline our ear to His sweet voice! And this is the commencement of a
   communion which may continue throughout life and consummate itself in
   everlasting Glory! Personally I can, sometimes, realize my text in a
   peculiar sense, when the Word of God becomes to me the instrument of
   usefulness. How often do I look around me anxiously for the next theme
   of discourse! My mind enquires, What shall I preach to the people? What
   shall be my message? With what shall I feed my Church? This is a trying
   question after 28 years preaching to one congregation!

   At last a passage comes home to my soul with power. I have found it.
   What joy fills the preacher's heart! No warrior was ever happier when
   he heaped up the mountains of prey. You meet with a person who is
   anxious--you want to say the right Word of God to him and, therefore,
   you prayerfully look all around until a text suggests itself, which
   proves to be the exact word for the person whose good you are seeking!
   Have you not felt great joy in handling such a passage as the
   instrument of usefulness? Have you not been ready to cry like the old
   Greek philosopher, "I have found it! I have found it!"? Have you not
   wanted to be off to tell it not only to the one person you are anxious
   about, but to 50,000 more?

   Ah, yes, you have rejoiced as one that finds great spoil. You see,
   then, that there is a distinct a joy which comes to the man who gets
   God's Word into his soul--a joy which arises out of the fact that there
   is a Word of God which comes to us as the Revelation of God, as an
   Infallible Guide through life, as the pledge of Divine mercy, the
   beginning of Divine communion and the instrument of usefulness! Upon
   all these things we might profitably enlarge, but time would not allow
   it, so I beg you to follow me to the next point. May the Holy Spirit
   lead our minds.

   II. Secondly, let us remark that FREQUENTLY THE JOY OF THE BELIEVER IN
   THE WORD ARISES OUT OF HIS HAVING HAD TO BATTLE TO OBTAIN A GRASP OF
   IT. Read the text again--"I rejoice at Your Word, as one that finds
   great spoil." Covered with sweat, dirty with dust, bleeding from many a
   wound, wearied and faint, the fighting man has conquered the enemy and
   now he staggers forward to seize his portion of the prey, finding new
   strength in

   the joy of victory. Did you ever have to do that with God's Word, for I
   have had to do many times, and I will try to describe the battle as I
   know it.

   "O my Soul, you have trod down strength." We have had to fight over
   certain doctrines before we could really come at them. Learning
   doctrines out of books, or merely learning them as matters of
   catechism, is never enough. Such teaching is all very useful and
   helpful, but the sure way to learn a doctrine is to have it burned into
   your soul as with a hot iron. "Oh," they say of me, "that man speaks so
   dogmatically." I cannot help it! Why should I speak with bated breath
   when I feel absolutely certain of what I say? If I were not certain, I
   would hold my tongue until I was. I could not dare to come here to talk
   of matters which may or may not be true! I dare not thus waste your
   time and thought. I have not only found the Doctrines of the Gospel in
   God's Word, but I have tested and tried them in my own experience--and
   they have been so powerfully operative upon my own soul that I must
   speak as I find.

   To me the things I preach are as assured as my existence! In fact, they
   are a part of my existence, since they are my life, my hope, my joy and
   strength. I am positive in speech because I am assured in mind. Nor can
   I see the gain which would accrue from the opposite style of speech. Of
   what use is this cloudy doubt? Unless a man speaks up to the best of
   his knowledge and belief, most positively, who is likely to believe
   him? Wise men will bid the speaker make up his own mind before he can
   hope to influence other minds. I have no doubt about the existence of a
   God. Have you? If you have, do not set up to be a minister for God by
   any manner of means!

   I have no doubt about the mediatorial power of His precious blood. Have
   you? If you have, do not pretend to be a Christian teacher, for your
   whole weight will be on the wrong side! Faith receives more stabs from
   waverers than from avowed skeptics. Sowers of doubt are no friends to
   the Gospel, for men are saved by faith--nobody was ever saved by
   unbelief. "We know and have believed the love which God has towards
   us." "I believed, therefore have I spoken." But how do we get to this
   assurance? Why, by fighting our way to it! A doctrine of God's Word
   comes before us. Our heart exclaims, "Yes, this seems to be the
   teaching of Scripture and, therefore, I must believe it." But carnal
   reason rebels and conjures up a phalanx of difficulties, while our
   proud human nature revolts from a Truth of God which is so little to
   its taste. These things have to be battled with.

   Faith has to bring all the faculties of the children of God upon their
   knees and to say to them, "Be quiet! Listen while God speaks--let God
   be true and every man a liar, and every faculty in the man a liar,
   too--sooner than God be distrusted." This is the victory we have to
   strive after--the triumph of a firm belief in the veracity of God. A
   doubt rises, then another and another, like a flight of bats when a
   dark cave is startled by the blaze of torches. Away they fly and light
   seizes on their dreary realm! Some minds have, for a time, to contend
   with doubts, army after army. Do not wonder if you have to strive,
   even, to blood, till your very soul bleeds over the doctrine! But
   rejoice that when once you thus win it, you will doubt no more and the
   Truth of God will become doubly precious to you ever afterwards!

   You have gained the Truth by fighting for it and, therefore, you cry,
   "This is my spoil and none shall rob me of it." Take away the giant's
   head from David? He is not to be so defrauded! Did he not cut it off
   himself? Did he not throw the stone which sank into the Philistine's
   forehead? So when a man has slain a thousand doubts in conflict over a
   doctrine and has, at last, come to assured belief, straightway he
   rejoices "as one that has found great spoil." What a fight there is,
   sometimes over a promise. Have you ever entered into such a contest? O
   gracious promise, most suitable to my case! How it would comfort my
   soul! But may I appropriate it? The devil says, "Certainly not!" He
   pushes us back from it. Our feeble hope assures us that it is too good
   to be true to us.

   A thousand doubtful suggestions assail us, till at last the soul, by a
   desperate effort, seizes the portion and holds it against all comers.
   We drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron! We take
   possession of their strongholds. Then does a man rejoice over a promise
   when he has believed it in the teeth of a thousand improbabilities and
   proved it to be true! He feels that he took the blessing out of the
   hand of the Amorite with his sword and with his bow, and from now on it
   is a peculiar portion to his soul and he rejoices over it, "as one that
   finds great spoil." It is a good thing to mark your Bibles when you
   have received a promise. Mark the margin with T and P--and let it stand
   for "tried and proved." Mark the passage which the Lord fulfils to you
   with some private seal, bearing witness to its truth!

   David set his own hand to the margin in many places as, for instance,
   when he exhorted us to wait on the Lord and then added, "Wait, I say,
   on the Lord." May that which is written with ink in the Bible be
   written with Grace on our hearts! May the public promise become a
   private promise to each one of us by the living experience of our own
   soul!

   Sometimes the hardest fight is round a precept. God has bid us do this
   and that, but carnal ease cries, "Let the precept alone!" And love of
   self says, "That command is too humbling! Pass it by." But oh, when you
   can battle with yourself and win the victory till your heart cries, "I
   will delight myself in Your Commandments, which I have loved," then
   your rejoicing will be great, indeed! What a joy to conquer yourself!
   What bliss to master your surroundings and all the peculiarities of
   yours disposition and temperament, so as to come to love the same
   precept which a little while ago was irksome! How the Believer loves
   the Law when he has fought down his rebellious will, vanquished his
   obstinacy, crushed his pride, fettered his levity and yielded himself
   wholly to the Word of the Lord! Holy Spirit, give us this joy!

   A sharp warfare often goes on over the threats. I have had many a
   wrestling match over them. A voice whispers in my ear, "that threat of
   God is too severe! That sentence of Scripture is too harsh." Certain of
   my Brethren carry a bit of pumice stone with them and rub down the
   rough texts. Whenever they find God speaking in wrathful indignation
   against sinners, they meet His terrors with a "larger hope." Things
   that are revealed belong to me, but things that are not revealed seem
   to belong to them! They have many learned ways of softening down
   disagreeable Truths of God. Now, if I find my mind quarrelling with any
   line of Scripture, I say to my soul, "You are wrong, or else you would
   be in accord with every Word of the Judge of all the earth." If I
   cannot yield unfeigned assent and consent to the justice of God, it
   does not occur to me to alter the Scripture, but to school my own heart
   till it bows before the thunder of Divine judgment!

   I try to get my heart into such a state that I can say, "If my soul
   were in God's place, this is exactly what I would say to the ungodly!
   This is precisely the measure I would deal out. For it must be right,
   it must be just or Jehovah would not so deal with men." When you are
   thus agreed with God, you will rejoice as one that finds great spoil,
   for you will be confident that to the toughest problems there is a
   gracious answer--and for the direst difficulties a sweet solution! It
   is hazardous to take the soul out of texts of Scripture and to attempt
   to give them souls of our own invention! Let us learn God's meaning and
   then become friends with it. Grow accustomed to the terrible texts
   till, like Daniel, you feel safe even in the lions' den! The doctrine
   of Eternal Punishment is no longer difficult for me to believe since I
   am confident that it is taught in the Scriptures. The difficulties of
   it are for God to solve and there I leave them, being well assured that
   in some way, or other, all that He does will be consistent with His
   justice and His love! Not without a battle does one consent unto the
   darker side of sacred Writ, but that once fought, there is rest.

   Yet, once more, this is true about the Word which reveals Christ. We
   know not Christ aright till we are conformed to what we know of Him. If
   Christ is lovely, we shall not understand that loveliness till we are,
   in a measure, lovely ourselves. The pure in heart see the pure and holy
   God because every man sees what he is. When the lady said to Mr.
   Turner, "Sir, I have seen that spot many times, but I never saw that
   which you have pictured." "No, Ma'am," he replied, "I dare say you have
   not. But don't you wish you could?" Just so, the artist's eye sees what
   another eye cannot--and the pure in heart see in God what nobody else
   can see because they are like God. When our minds become molded like
   the mind of Christ, then we understand Christ! If there is anything
   about the Character of our Divine Exemplar which staggers us, let us
   pray our way into it!

   We must get to be like He and, oh, when we do, then every line of that
   dear face will be conspicuously and transcen-dentally charming to us
   because we have come to it through suffering! The inner experience of
   many a child of God lies much in conflict and contention--and scarcely
   an inch of Scripture is truly gained without fighting for it foot to
   foot with those who would rob us of our inheritance! Canaan was given
   to Israel by the Lord, Himself, by a Covenant of Salt, but we all
   remember the long list of enemies that already occupied it. What is the
   name of them? Hivites, Hittites, Periz-zites, Jebusites--I will not
   trouble you with more, so many and so ugly are the names of those who
   would keep back the Believer from his portion in the Covenant. One of
   old said, "They compassed me about like bees: like bees they compassed
   me about" and yet he added, "But in the name of the Lord will I destroy
   them."

   May it be our resolve that we will take every part of the Word of God
   to be our heritage and rejoice over it "as one that finds great spoil."

   III. We shall now tarry a moment upon a third thought which is
   altogether different from that which has gone before. AT TIMES THE JOY
   OF THE BELIEVER LIES IN ENJOYING GOD'S WORD WITHOUT ANY FIGHTING

   AT ALL. In the text I am not sure that fighting is certainly mentioned
   or necessarily implied, though it is highly probable. David says, "I
   rejoice at Your Word, as one that finds great spoil," as if he fell
   upon it all of a sudden, like the lep-

   ers at the gate of Samaria who, to their surprise, found all the way
   they traversed covered with garments, gold and silver vessels! They had
   not lifted a finger in war, yet they found great spoil--like the man in
   the parable who, when he was plowing, found a treasure hidden in the
   field. He had never looked for it, but he had great joy in discovering
   it.

   In infinite mercy the Lord makes His Word open up before His people
   when they are not seeking it, according to the promise, "I am found of
   them that sought Me not." Have you ever experienced what this means and
   have you not rejoiced as one that suddenly finds spoil? The Word of the
   Lord is often as spoil found, not fought for. The promise lies before
   me on the way and I find it--and by the Law of the Kingdom of Grace it
   becomes mine for the finding. There it is and the Spirit of God reveals
   it to me! And I take it, asking no leave whatever, since all Covenant
   blessings are free to us when we are free to take them. Our warrant for
   feeding at the banquet of love is the fact that God has set before us
   an open door and we are invited to enter in! What joy is this!

   This spoil, however, must have cost somebody else most dear, though it
   has cost us nothing. If we did not fight for it, somebody else fought
   for it once. Ah, what a fight was that! Let Gethsemane and Calvary
   tell. What joy there is in seizing the spoil which Jesus has left us as
   the result of His life's warfare! We have not trod the winepress, but
   yet we drink the wine! The blessing is free to us, but it cost Him
   groans, tears, bloody sweat and death! "This is David's spoil." Look
   down and see the mark of the victor's feet! See you not where the nails
   went in? The Crucified One has been here and smitten all our
   adversaries and left this spoil for us poor creatures to divide among
   ourselves! Great is the spoil--all the spoils of death and Hell! All
   that father Adam was robbed of is recovered from the robbers! Life,
   light, peace, joy, holiness, immortality, Heaven--all these are brought
   back by our great Conqueror who has taken the prey from the mighty and
   brought back the lawful captives, leading captivity captive!

   O, Brothers and Sisters, we rejoice when we get a hold of the precious
   treasures of the Word as Jesus Christ's spoil, fought for by Himself
   and then distributed to us! What a joy there is in our heart when we
   remember what foes our Lord overcame to gain all this spoil for us! Sin
   has been routed, Death has been slain and Hell has been stripped of its
   prey-- our direst enemies are broken in pieces and the crown of their
   head is crushed by Him who is the Seed of the woman--the Messiah of
   God! Whenever a passage of Scripture sings to you of itself, sing with
   it before the Lord! Whenever in reading, the verse seems to leap out of
   the page into your bosom--there let it lodge forever! Whenever in
   hearing the Word of God it darts into your heart, then will you
   understand what David meant when he said that his soul rejoiced over
   God's Word "as one who," by a happy, blessed find, "finds great spoil."

   IV. My fourth head is the principal one and I need all your attention
   while I dwell on it for a short time. THERE IS

   A JOY ARISING OUT OF THE VERY FACT THAT HOLY SCRIPTURE MAY BE
   CONSIDERED TO BE A SPOIL. I

   will show you that in five particulars. First, a spoil is the end of
   the uncertainty. Whenever a fight begins, it is questionable who will
   win. While it rages, the result still hangs quivering in the balances,
   but we know who has won the battle when the victor begins to divide the
   spoil. No question now remains--the debate is ended. Blessed is that
   man who has found in Scripture a spoil in the sense that he has come to
   the end of uncertainty and arrived at something without doubt.

   All men that think crave after certainty and gradually settle down to
   one standard or another. I have heard of two brothers, equally honest
   and thoughtful men, who commenced life at the same point, but parted in
   their search after a foundation firm and strong. One of them, at last,
   gravitated to the church of Rome, for he thought he discovered
   certainty in an historical church and in one at the head of it whose
   utterances are regarded as infallible. I do not envy him his ideal
   certainty--it seems to me to be a mass of fraud--a great historical
   imposture. The other brother found his resting place in his own reason,
   or in the fact that he could not be sure of anything. There is a
   certainty in being certain that you are not certain of anything--but
   certainly it is not a certainty which would afford comfort to me--for
   my reason would be to me a sorry guide for eternal things, since even
   in everyday concerns it has misled me!

   We must find certainty somewhere, or believe that we have found it, or
   else we shall be, of all men, most miserable. If a man has no standard
   of infallibility outside, he tries to find it in himself and becomes
   his own pope--and depend upon it, a pope in England is as likely to err
   as a pope in Rome! I would not give two pence for the two of you and if
   I threw myself in, it would not add an extra farthing to the value.
   When a man has in experience fought up to confidence in the Word of the
   Lord, or has had it effectually laid home by the Holy Spirit to his own
   soul, then he reaches the end of the

   controversy so far as he, himself, is concerned--he is dividing the
   spoil, for he says--"We have known and believed the love which God has
   towards us."

   Of course, people come round and say, "You are mistaken." Our answer
   is, "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. It may not be
   certainty to you, but it is to me." If a man should assert, "Oh, that
   medicine is all quackery," he has a right to speak his mind, but his
   decision is not final. "Not so," cries another, "I have been ill
   half-a-dozen times and on each occasion I have speedily recovered
   through its use! Call it quackery if you like, it is no quackery to me,
   at any rate, for I am certain about its good effects." So is it when a
   man has, at last, by the application of the Spirit of God, felt the
   power of God's Word over his soul. He says, "I am not going to fight
   that battle again. I am sure of the Truth of that Scripture." Such a
   man is restful about that matter.

   I would to God that all of you had this certainty as some of us have.
   How horrible it is to grope in the eternal fog, to flounder in primeval
   chaos seeing no road or landmark; turning this way and finding it night
   and the other way equally darkness; to the right, disorder; to the
   left, questions! Oh, to get to know that God loves me and that I love
   God! To know that Christ has redeemed me, my sin is put away and to
   feel all this witnessed in my soul by the Holy Spirit! This is to
   rejoice in the end of uncertainty as one that divides the spoil!

   The next idea that comes out of the figure of spoil is this. It is the
   weakening of the adversary for any future attacks, for when they divide
   the spoil they say to one another, "The invaders will be here again, no
   doubt, before long, but they will not have this great gun to turn upon
   us--we have spiked it. Their stock of ammunition will be somewhat
   diminished by the capture of their magazines and they will not have
   this huge chest of gold with which to purchase more martial equipment,
   for we have taken it from them. We have weakened the adversary. Have we
   not entered their strongholds? Have we not captured their
   quadrilateral? They may again take up arms, but their force is broken."

   Every doubt a man conquers by resting on the Infallible Word of God has
   weakened the power of unbelief within him and strengthened his faith.
   Blessed is that man who has so trusted in his God that doubts are now
   but as the grasshopper which is only a burden to the feeble. O the joy
   of saying, "I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is
   able to keep that which I have committed unto Him." Or to cry with the
   once-blind man, "One thing I know, whereas I was blind, now I see!"
   Tasting and handling of the good things of the Kingdom of God, we rise
   into a region of fact and leave suppositions and quibbles far below! In
   this lies a part of the joy of taking the spoil--we hope for less
   disturbance of heart, less peril of intellect, less struggle of soul
   from this time forth. The horns of the adversary have been broken and
   they cannot harm us as before.

   Next, in dividing the spoil there is always a sense of victory and so
   there is in believing God's Word. In getting firm hold upon the
   faithful Testimony of our God, we achieve a conquest over doubts,
   fears, disquietudes and all our proud judgments of God. There is a
   sense of conquest when we overcome our passions and propensities and do
   the Lord's bidding according to His precepts and statutes. When that
   which at one time was difficult, if not impossible, becomes easy and
   delightful, then we wave the palm branch over a defeated enemy! When
   the mind is brought into subjection to all and every revealed Truth of
   God, then have we done more than if we had taken a strong city! "This
   is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith." May we have
   more of it and go from strength to strength, doing valiantly in the
   name of the Lord!

   Again, in dividing the spoil there is profit, pleasure and honor. I am
   not about to justify the deeds of war, for these I hate--as to plunder
   and chaos, such as have been indulged in by the general run of
   conquerors--they are detestable crimes! Men have made themselves worse
   than devils to men. No calamities have ever befallen nations that are
   so much to be deplored as the atrocities of war! I use the warlike
   metaphor, but condemn the fact! Men conceive, when they divide the
   spoil, that there is honor in it. Look at the crowds that gathered
   along the Via Sacra when the Roman conquerors came down from the Apian
   Way, passed under the arch and marched towards the capitol! Then did
   the populace crowd the house roofs and the chimney tops that they might
   see a Scipio or a Caesar expose his captives and display his spoils.

   They shouted till they were hoarse and wearied themselves with applause
   at the sight of the spolia opima which were borne in the procession.
   Thus men judge of plunder in war. See how Napoleon thought to glorify
   himself by placing in Paris the works of art which he had taken from
   the capitals of Europe! What are most trophies but stolen goods, or
   that which is purchased by them? But when you and I lay hold of Holy
   Scripture, then have we grasped a prey more precious than royal
   treasures, a prey which we may hold with justice and honor! When we can
   say that the things which God has

   revealed are ours, then we are rich beyond a miser's dream and when we
   can hold them against all comers! Then that which we believe becomes
   our honor and gives glory to us and glory to faith and chief glory to
   Him who worked our faith in us by His almighty Spirit!

   Last of all, the spoil is a prophecy of rest and so is that delightful
   dividing up of the Word of God and the appropriation thereof by faith.
   "Ah," said the Romans when they spoiled old Carthage, "we shall never
   see another Hannibal at our gates, nor dread the ships of Carthage in
   our seas." They had overcome their most potent adversary when they
   utterly spoiled her--and then they looked for a long period of peace.
   And that is the joy of receiving the Word of God! When we can believe
   that Jesus took our sin and suffered for them on the tree, we are no
   more troubled as to the guilt of sin! When we believe that our heavenly
   Father overrules all things for the good of His people, then sorrow and
   sighs, fear and frets flee away! Well may he rest who sees even evil
   made to work for his good!

   When we believe that Jesus died and rose again from the dead, then the
   fear of death which haunts so many receives its mortal wound. Knowing
   the meaning of the word, "He that believes in Me, though he were dead
   yet shall he live," the dread of death has no more dominion over us!
   The appropriation of the Divine promise, as the soldier appropriates
   his share of the booty, is to us the prophecy that the war is over! We
   may rest, now, and be quiet. And oh, what joy, what blessedness is
   this! How I would that all those who are here present were believers in
   my Master--first in Jesus the great Incarnate Word--and then in this
   book, the written Word of God and that you did not only believe these
   things to be true, but took them to yourselves as warriors take the
   spoil!

   Happy and blessed would you be and your rejoicing this day would be as
   the joy of harvest, or as the shouting of them that divide the spoil!
   God grant it may be so, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

"Verily, Verily"

   (No. 1642)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 29, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that hears My Word, and believes on
   Him that sent Me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into
   condemnation but is passed from death unto life." John 5:24.

   "Verily, Verily, I say unto you, he that believes on Me has everlasting
   life."-

   John 6:47.

   THE words "Verily, verily," as they were solemnly used by our Divine
   Lord, indicate an utterance of special importance. If Jesus says,
   "Verily, verily," there is something coming to which we should attend
   with all our hearts! The subject which He thus introduces is our
   possession of eternal life and our being delivered from condemnation by
   faith in Himself. Can any theme be more important? Many questions may
   be asked, but they can all afford to wait till we get the answer to
   that first enquiry, "What must I do to be saved?" What shall it profit
   a man if he gains the whole world of knowledge and knows not the way of
   life? If he wins a world in this life, what will that matter to him if
   he misses life everlasting?

   It is very considerate on our Lord's part to call us with such great
   solemnity to think about our souls and eternal life. Let us attend to
   His appeal. Come here, dear Hearer, and bend over the words which Jesus
   commends to you with a double emphasis, saying, "Verily, verily." Our
   Lord used this, "Verily, verily," to denote a clear and certain
   Revelation. There must be an end to all doubt when Jesus says, "Verily,
   verily." His ordinary word is true, for nothing but the Truth of God
   can come from Him who is "The Truth." But when He uses His strongest
   exhortation, "Verily, verily," then we must regard the statement with
   special reverence if we are, indeed, His loyal subjects.

   When Jesus says, "Verily, verily," we see two armies of truth gathered
   around His royal standard. His declaration is to be accepted as the
   indisputable, immutable, infallible Truth of God. Do you not agree to
   this? Carefully notice where this certainty lies--it rests solely upon
   the Word of Jesus--"I say unto you." In the matter of our salvation,
   carnal reason never arrives at certainty. Mere argument can never bring
   a troubled heart to a sure anchorage. The certainty which Christ sets
   before us rests upon His own solemn assertion. Instead of proof, the
   Incarnate Son of God gives us-- "Verily, verily, I say unto you." If
   you are His disciples, and would enjoy the benefits of His salvation,
   you must accept your Lord's statement without question. Doubts and
   reason must lie down at His feet and it must be enough that Jesus says
   it.

   The ipse dixit of a mere man is not enough, but those of us who adore
   the Lord Jesus as the Son of God desire no better assurance than the
   Word of His lips! Here is our ultimate ground of faith, our main
   argument with mankind, our final answer to Satan and the eternal
   quietus of every misgiving--Jesus says it! We shall never arrive at
   certainty as to everlasting life except by a conviction that Jesus
   Christ, the Son of God, is Infallible in everything that He says. I had
   rather have one word from Jesus than volumes of human reason, however
   conclusive they may appear! Our judgment has often deceived us--even
   our senses play us false and our emotions are no more to be depended on
   than the winds and waves-- but here is a rocky foundation, firm as the
   pillars of Heaven! "Verily, verily, I say unto you."

   It is clear that the teaching of this present verse must be accepted by
   all Christians. They must either believe it or reject their Lord, for
   He does, as it were, stake His own Character for Truth upon this
   utterance by prefacing it with, "I say unto you." Jesus does not leave
   the way of life a moot point, but decides it with all authority, states
   it in plain terms and sets it forth, formally, in a declaration for
   which He will be forever responsible. If you reject this teaching, you
   must reject the Teacher, Himself! Nothing of authority remains to Jesus
   if you take liberty to question this point, for He does not put it as a
   matter of report, or inference, but as a Truth of God to be accepted on
   His own authority--"Verily, verily, I say unto you."

   I have heard some who call themselves Christians talk about the
   Doctrine of Salvation through faith in Christ as if it were a mere
   theory of what they are pleased to call the Evangelical School--but is
   it so? Is it not our Lord's own teaching? Our opponents have full
   liberty to canvass the peculiar tenets of a party--and the more they do
   so the better--but this teaching is not ours! It is the teaching of Him
   whom these critics call Master and Lord! Is this their reverence for
   the Son of God? Do they challenge Him to His face and question that
   which He asserts with a double verily and certifies by the dignity of
   His Person and the veracity of His Character?

   I am equally at issue with those who admit the Doctrine of
   Justification by Faith and then add that it is to be guardedly stated
   and cautiously presented! Does Jesus teach dangerous doctrine? This
   Truth of God is constantly assailed by the carnally wise, but is that a
   reason for mistrusting it when Jesus puts it forward in such a form?
   Understand clearly that if you reject the doctrine of life through
   believing, you reject the authority of Jesus! It is useless to talk
   about being a Christian if you are not prepared to believe what Jesus
   Christ asserts, for one of the first requisites for a true disciple is
   faith in his Master!

   What kind of follower can he be who takes liberty to question when his
   Master stands erect in all the dignity of His glorious perfection and
   cries, "Verily, verily, I say unto you"? Are any of you such hypocrites
   as to call yourselves Christians and give Christ the lie? Dare you
   treat Him as if He were one of yourselves, to be disputed with and
   criticized at pleasure? This is not reverence, but rejection! I might
   justly call it blasphemy! Note well the verse which precedes the
   text--"That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the
   Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent
   Him."

   On the heels of that claim comes this assertion of everlasting life
   through hearing His Word and believing on Him that sent Him--as much as
   to say, "Believe what I am now about to say, even as if the Father
   spoke, for implicit faith is due to Me. If you would honor Me, believe
   in Me. But if you refuse what I say, you do Me the greatest dishonor."
   Jesus regards this point as being so vital that He pledges His own
   Character for veracity as a guarantee for the doctrine! He does as good
   as say, "If you would honor Me, believe this Truth of God which I now
   declare upon My own authority."

   I feel, this morning, great restfulness of heart as to what I have to
   say. I shall not speak at haphazard upon a matter of opinion,
   speculation, or probability--nor shall I beg your consent and agreement
   as a matter of favor! I stand fair and square before you and I demand
   the assent of all who profess and call themselves Christians upon a
   point which Jesus has set at rest forever by the solemn declaration,
   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believes in Me has everlasting
   life." Such as are prepared to reject the authority of the Lord Jesus
   may do so. To them I have no message this morning. But to all such as
   acknowledge His Messiahship and Deity, I present the doctrine of the
   text as worthy of all acceptation.

   May the Holy Spirit help me to set it out with clearness and enable you
   to receive it into your inmost souls. Our Savior is speaking of a great
   blessing and our first head is the person to whom this blessing comes--
   "He that hears My Word and believes on Him that sent Me has everlasting
   life." We shall speak, secondly, upon the blessing itself-- "He has
   everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed
   from death unto life." And thirdly, and this will be the point I shall
   lay most stress upon--the singular assurance with which it is stated,
   the wonderful firmness and distinctness with which it is asserted by
   the Master--and backed up with, "Verily, verily, I say unto you."

   I. First, then, THE PERSON TO WHOM THIS BLESSING COMES. Read the
   passage and you notice, first, that

   the privileged individual is a hearer who is also a Believer. "He that
   hears My Word, and believes on Him that sent Me, has everlasting life."
   It does not appear, from our text, that everlasting life is
   communicated by drops of water, or in any other ceremonial manner--the
   command is, "Hear, and your soul shall live." Men are not expected to
   believe that which they have never heard. They are not to take the
   articles of the church rolled up, as it were, into a pill,
   silver-coated, and to swallow them, be they what they may, without
   instruction.

   We are to act towards saving Truth as we do in reference to other
   information--we are to hear it with attention-- and so receive it.
   Those who find everlasting life, first hear of Jesus, His mission, His
   Person, His work, His sufferings, His offices, His power and the
   blessings He has come to communicate. Listening to all this, they are
   grateful for being permitted to hear things which kings and prophets
   desired to hear but heard not! Do not expect that you can be saved if
   you shut your ears to the Gospel! Do not reckon that the same blessing
   will come to you if you carelessly walk the streets on the Sabbath as
   might come to you if you were diligent in listening to the Word of the
   Redeemer! Hear what the Lord says and let your whole heart yield itself
   to the Truths of God!

   But these people, while they are hearers to begin with, do not stop
   there--they become Believers. They believe that Jesus is the appointed
   Savior and they accept Him as such for themselves. They believe that
   His blood cleanses men from sin and, therefore, they trust in His blood
   to cleanse them and are cleansed by it. Since His righteousness
   justifies, they are glad to accept that righteousness and to be
   justified. Theirs is not a dreamy, inactive hearing--when they know the
   Truth, they practice what they know! They not only know that the brazen
   serpent will heal, but they look to it and are healed. I am talking to
   some of the best hearers in the world, and yet I fear that many of you
   come short because you are only hearers and not doers of that Word of
   God which says, "Believe and live."

   Note again, these favored persons are Believers who remain hearers in
   the fullest sense. These persons believe in God who has sent the Lord
   Jesus into the world and, consequently, they believe that what Jesus
   says must be true. And then they hear His voice with a discerning,
   spiritual ear. Our Lord uses the word, "hear," in a special sense when
   He says, "My sheep hear My voice." They hear their Shepherd, but they
   know not the voice of strangers. "Blessed are the people that know the
   joyful sound. They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of Your
   Countenance." Believers are taught of the Lord to perceive the
   difference between Truth and error, between the teachings of mere
   legalists and the voice of the Gospel of Grace! Of others it is said,
   "their ears are dull of hearing," but upon these, a miracle of Grace
   has been worked so that they hear the voice of the Son of God!

   Dear Friend, is this your case? Is the name of Jesus sweet to you? Is a
   promise pronounced by His voice most comforting to your soul? Then be
   of good cheer, for you have everlasting life and come not under
   condemnation! You are resting upon the faithful promise of the Father,
   brought to you by the Word of His own Son! And because of this, you are
   quickened and justified! Jesus declares it is so. Do not doubt Him,
   lest you do despite to that blessed, "Verily, verily," with which He
   prefaces the Word of God.

   The quickened ones are described in our second text as Believers in the
   Lord Jesus. "He that believes in Me has everlasting life." They have a
   personal faith in a personal Savior. They believe that God must punish
   sin; that God has punished sin in the Person of Jesus and that He has,
   therefore, set forth His Son, Jesus Christ, to be a Propitiation for
   sin, that "whoever believes in Him might not perish, but have
   everlasting life." This they believe and on this they lean the full
   weight of their souls! Jesus says, "Come unto Me, all you that labor
   and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." And they come to Him
   for rest and receive rest. This is the main point in the character of
   those who have everlasting life-- they are not here said to do
   anything, or achieve anything--but they believe in Jesus, the Christ!

   The saved are also described as believers in Jesus because of the
   witness of the Father. "He that hears My Word, and believes on Him that
   sent Me." Why do I believe that Jesus Christ is my Savior? Because the
   Father has sent Him and borne witness to Him. I am sure that He can
   save me, for He is divinely commissioned, divinely furnished and the
   pleasure of the Lord must prosper in His hands. I believe today that He
   who came to the waters of Jordan to be baptized was the Son of God, for
   the Father said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

   I believe that He who went up to the mountain and was transfigured in
   the presence of His three disciples was the Son of God, for once again,
   the Father said in an audible voice, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I
   am well pleased. Hear you Him." I believe that Jesus Christ can save
   me, for when He prayed, a voice was heard from Heaven bearing witness
   that He was heard of the Father. The people that stood by knew not the
   meaning, but said that it thundered--yet there were some that heard
   that voice and knew it to be the witness of the Lord! Those who have
   everlasting life believe in Jesus as the Christ of God because the
   Father has given witness to Him in many ways--by an audible voice, by
   miracles, by the gift of the Holy Spirit and by constantly fulfilling,
   in the ministry of Christ's Word, the promises which He made unto us in
   connection therewith. This faith in God our Father and in our Lord
   Jesus Christ saves the soul!

   But notice that our Lord has spoken these words of every such
   Believer--"He that hears My Word, and believes on Him that sent Me, has
   everlasting life." Whatever else he may have or may not have, this is
   the vital point. "But, Lord, he is full of fault and imperfection."
   There is no exception made on that grounds, for, "by Him all that
   believe are justified from all things." "But the believing man makes
   many mistakes in points of theology." Nothing is said in the text as to
   errors upon other points, but the text positively says, "Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, he that hears My Word, and believes on Him that
   sent Me, has everlasting life." If there is genuine faith in Jesus,
   there will be a sincere desire to understand all His teachings and a
   readiness to believe them. But as for ignorance and mistakes, they are
   covered with all our other sins by the great Atonement which is
   received by faith!

   "But, Lord, he is, himself, afraid that he has not attained to
   everlasting life. He trembles lest he should be found lacking when put
   into the balances." No exception is made on account of timidity and
   diffidence! If any man believes in Christ Jesus, the statement is made
   absolutely of him and of everyone like he, that he "has everlasting
   life." Old or young, rich or poor, learned or illiterate, talented or
   obscure, there is no difference! All Believers have everlasting life!
   But, mark you, there is no statement made as to the salvation of any
   other sort of person! Nothing is said about the baptized person who is
   not a Believer.

   He has been made a member of Christ, an heir of God and an inheritor of
   the kingdom of Heaven in Baptism, according to the Prayer Book--but is
   it true? Our text says nothing about the baptized, confirmed and
   sacramental unbeliever having everlasting life! There is not a word
   that says it from Genesis to Revelation! Other books may say what they
   will, but this Book of God makes no account of any man who is devoid of
   faith. Did you tell me that such a one has been a professor of religion
   for many years and his outward life has been most commendable? So far,
   so good! But that is not all. Indeed, it is beside the mark as to the
   teaching now before us, for the text says absolutely nothing about
   outward morality and correctness of conduct!

   These things are sure to be found where faith is found, but alone and
   by themselves, they answer not to the qualification laid down by our
   Lord. If a man believe not on Christ there is no cheering word for him,
   be he what he may. No one is left without eternal life that believes in
   Jesus--and no unbeliever is blessed with that life. What says the
   Scriptures? "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he
   that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God
   abides on him." We now know the persons to whom the blessings of
   salvation have come. I hope that many of us are numbered with them.

   II. Very briefly let us notice THE BLESSINGS WHICH BELONG TO BELIEVING.
   First, our Lord asserts that the Believer "has everlasting life." He
   was condemned to die and reckoned as a dead man, but he is now
   acquitted and his life is granted him. He was spiritually dead, but the
   fact that he believes in Jesus is sufficient evidence that he has
   received spiritual life. John tells us in his Epistle, "These things
   have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God;
   that you may know that you have eternal life."

   This spiritual life is not a thing of time only--it is expressly called
   "everlasting." Those who in these days make out that "everlasting" does
   not mean unending, will, I dare say, squeeze the life-blood out of our
   text. But the most of us take the word to mean what it says and to
   signify life which will never end. If I have received life in Jesus
   Christ, I have received a life which will endure as long as the
   Everlasting Covenant, as long as everlasting love, as long as the
   Everlasting God! According to a certain theology, a man may have life
   in Christ one day and lose it the next--how, then, is it everlasting
   life? If a man has lost his life, that life could not have been
   everlasting--that is clear. That which comes to an end could not have
   been everlasting.

   But we teach with the authority of Christ that the man that believes on
   Christ has, at this moment, within him a life that can never expire!
   The man may die after the flesh, but he can never die after the Spirit.
   There is for him no second death possible, unless the Bible expression
   is a mere trifling with language. The Believer has within him a life
   which is derived from Christ Himself-- "I in them"--and this life
   depends upon the life of Christ, even as He has put it, "Because I
   live, you shall live also." The Believer has this everlasting life now,
   for it is not said, "shall have," but, "has everlasting life." What a
   gift this is! To be born in the image of God! To be a partaker of His
   Nature! To be placed beyond all reach of the second death! Glory be to
   God for this!

   Notice, next, that the Believer is in a condition of non-condemnation.
   He "shall not come into condemnation." The translation would be more
   accurate if it were put, "and comes not into judgment"--that is to say,
   as soon as a man has believed in Christ he receives the benefit of
   Christ's Substitution and is no longer under judgment, much less
   condemnation. In Christ, the Believer has been judged, condemned and
   punished and is, therefore, clear of the Law and all its penalties. If
   we have, by our Surety, answered all the demands of Justice, what has
   the Law to do with us? How can it bring us into judgment? How can it
   cause us to know condemnation? But will not the righteous be present in
   the judgment of the Last Day? Undoubtedly we shall all appear before
   the Judgment Seat of Christ--but the judgment of that day will not be a
   judgment to us in the dreadful sense of the term.

   When a man is perfectly clear and called into court on purpose to be
   publicly acquitted, it is no judgment to him! "The Lord shall call to
   the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge His
   people." And this is our joy,

   that our God shall come and shall not keep silent." It will be no
   penalty, but a great delight, to stand before the great King and hear
   Him say, "Come, you blessed of My Father, enter the kingdom prepared
   for you from the foundation of the world."

   Our text has another sentence of privilege--he "has passed from death
   unto life." Notice where judgment is. Look, here is death! Yonder is
   life and resurrection! Judgment, as it were, stands between the two. We
   have passed from death to life and so we have passed by the judgment!
   There is a doctrinal error which cannot be too much condemned, that the
   resurrection is already past--but there is a blessed spiritual Truth of
   God that cannot be too firmly grasped--that Believers are already the
   children of the resurrection by having received quickening as to their
   spirits. In regeneration lies the essence and major portion of
   resurrection! We have already passed from the kingdom of Death into the
   kingdom of Life and so have passed by the judgment, since Jesus was
   judged for us, condemned for us and made to die in our place.

   Abraham was called a Hebrew, or passer-over, and we, too, are Hebrews,
   having passed from one kingdom to another, being delivered from the
   power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son!
   Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us and through Him we live. If
   Christ has suffered in our place, we cannot suffer for sin! Justice
   demands that we go free. What a miracle of mercy is this, that everyone
   that has believed in Jesus has left death behind him, never to return
   to it! He has entered the realm of life, never to be banished from it!
   And he has, on the road, passed under the rod of judgment and the sword
   of condemnation so that neither of these can further afflict him in
   time or in eternity!

   Did I hear someone object, "You make too much of so small a matter as
   believing. You make out that simply by trusting in Jesus Christ there
   is a difference made between one man and another of a most
   extraordinary kind--and that it is made at once"? Yes, I do say that!
   Exactly that and, as far as I am concerned, I do not care how much you
   quarrel with it, I shall not tone down the statement--"He that believes
   and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be
   damned." I hear you mutter, "I think you are very uncharitable." Say so
   if you please. I shall prove my charitableness by bearing it.

   But look! Here is a person standing right in the middle of a railway
   track and I say to him, "My dear Fellow, if you do not come off that
   track, you will be smashed to atoms within the next five minutes, for
   an express train is thundering along the line." He laughs and answers,
   "Do you mean to say that my shifting the position of my body a couple
   of feet will make all that difference? Do you tell me that if I move, I
   shall be safe, and that if I stand here I shall be cut to pieces?"
   "Yes, I do say it and say it with tears, begging you to believe me and
   get off the track." "Then," he says, "you are very uncharitable."
   "Yes," I reply, "and you are very insane!" What more can I say? It is
   never uncharitable to speak the truth for the good of the person
   concerned. A small matter may suffice to shape the destiny of an
   immortal soul!

   In those evil times, when there were slaves across the Atlantic, a lady
   went down to one of our ships, accompanied by her Negro servant. The
   lady remarked to the captain that it she were to go to England and take
   this black woman with her, she would become free as soon as she landed.
   The captain replied, "Madam, she is free already. The moment she came
   on board a British vessel she was free." When the Negro woman knew
   this, do you think she went on shore with her mistress? By no means!
   She chose to keep her liberty. But what made her rise from a slave to a
   free woman? Why, only a few inches of separation from the shore!

   I do not know how far the ship was from land--the distance may have
   been very little--still it made all the difference in the world! She
   was free on board and a slave on land. How slight the change of place,
   but how great the difference involved. Marvel not that faith involves
   such great things! I heard a grumbler say, "We do not need this
   doctrine. What we need is morality and honesty." Just so. You remind me
   of a poor little child. His father planted bulbs to come up in the
   spring and make the garden gay with golden flowers. But the boy said,
   "We don't need bulbs; we need crocus cups and daffodils." The child
   forgot that flowers never grow without roots. You, too, good Sir,
   forget that holy lives cannot grow without a cause--and faith is the
   root of virtue!

   Flowers stuck into the ground without roots are babes' follies. And
   good works without faith are childish vanities. We preach faith in
   order that good works may follow--and they do follow--and are the
   fruits of that eternal life which men receive by faith. Are you not
   willing to get the flowers through the roots? Go, silly children, and
   grow wiser!

   III. I close with my last head, which is THE ASSURANCE WITH WHICH THIS
   DOCTRINE IS STATED in my

   text. It was that which attracted me to it. First, the doctrine of this
   text is certified to us by the terms in which our Lord utters it. I
   have already told you this, but I mean to go over it again. Our Lord
   Jesus, whose name is Faithful and True,

   here pledges His honor as God, His veracity as Man, upon the certainty
   of this doctrine. He says, "Verily, verily." These two words sound to
   me like great guns leveled against unbelief! Like the two brazen
   pillars called Joachim and Boaz, these two verities stand in the porch
   of Mercy's temple and show us where there is establishment and strength
   in the Word of the Son of Man!

   Our Lord then adds, "I say unto you." Then it must be so, or else the
   Lord speaks in error--and none think that for a moment, for He is
   Wisdom itself! Is He not the only wise God, our Savior? Do you dream
   that these words may mean less then they say? That were to charge the
   Lord with insincerity, mocking poor souls with great words and small
   meanings! No, you would count it profane to imagine such a thing! " He
   that believes in Me has everlasting life" must, then, mean what it
   says. Christ knows what is everlasting life and who has it, for there
   is no eye like His that can discern life, wherever it may be, and
   discriminate between the false and the true. Others might be mistaken
   and deceived, but Christ knows what is the true life, being, Himself,
   the living and true God.

   Jesus also knows whether we shall be judged and condemned or not, for
   He is, Himself, the Judge. The Father has committed all judgment unto
   the Son and if your Judge, Himself, says that we shall never come into
   condemnation, we can have no cause for fear. Who is he that condemns?
   Christ that died, who, sitting at the right hand of God, who also makes
   intercession for us? Impossible! Our Lord Jesus also knows the
   future--it is before Him as if it were present. He foresees everything
   that can possibly happen and so if He testifies of yon Believer, "he
   shall never come into condemnation," then depend upon it, the fact is
   sure! If a Prophet speaks, you believe him--shall you not much more
   believe the Son of God? The Believer has everlasting life--it is
   true--it is most surely true!

   The question may be raised, Why does our Lord like to put it so very,
   very positively? Did I hear any of you grumbling in your hearts, just
   now, at my going over the same ground? I did it on purpose because it
   is with such great difficulty that you can get men to accept this
   humbling Truth of God. Human nature revolts against it. As for the
   unconverted, even when they begin to feel their need of a Savior they
   cannot think it true that by believing in Jesus Christ they will pass
   from death to life! Salvation must be by faith that it may be of
   Grace--and it must be of Grace or not at all! But proud souls will not
   have it so. A man must be driven to self-despair before he will agree
   to be saved by faith in Christ.

   You who deal much with souls know how they try to escape their own
   mercy and avoid the loving kindness of the Lord. Even you that have
   believed and are saved are not half as sure as you ought to be. Are
   there not times with you when you say, "I do not feel as I wish and,
   therefore, I am not saved"? What argument is there in that? Can your
   feelings make Christ a liar? Remember, the evidence of yours being
   saved as a Believer lies wholly in that, "I say unto you." Perhaps you
   are not sure that you have everlasting life and yet you are sure that
   you are a Believer in Jesus. How is this? This is questioning Christ's
   veracity! His strongest affirmation is, "Verily, verily." Is He not to
   be believed on this? You, as His dear disciple, lover and friend, would
   be very indignant if anyone cast a suspicion upon His truthfulness--why
   will you do it yourself? Accept the truth heartily! Never doubt it, but
   let it stand as a fact most sure and steadfast that your faith has
   saved you!

   It is, then, if you are a Believer, absolutely certain that you shall
   never be condemned, but have passed from death unto life--the Lord puts
   it so positively that we may be right positive about it. Why are you
   not, as a Believer, absolutely certain of yours possession of eternal
   life? The Master, who knew our unbelief, has put the matter so straight
   and plain that nobody can get over it without rejecting His Word. It is
   certain that he that believes in Him has everlasting life--certain,
   then, that we are saved if we are Believers. We must not be afraid to
   believe this with great confidence and to rejoice because of it!
   Someone says, "Ah, but it might be presumption." Presumption to believe
   that Jesus speaks the Truth? I will tell you what is presumption--to
   question anything that our Lord has said! Is He your Master and Lord?
   If He is not, say so! But if He is, will you venture to sit upon the
   throne and judge the sayings of yours own Lord and say, "This may be
   true and that may be false"?

   Another objector cries, "But I think a person may be too certain." A
   person may be a great deal too certain if the argument is based upon
   inference. But if a statement is based upon the personal testimony of
   the Lord Jesus, we cannot be too certain of it! Circumstantial evidence
   is often very powerful and, to some minds, irresistible. Yet the
   inference drawn from it may be false. But your witness of a person who
   cannot err is worth all the circumstantial evidence in the world! Jesus
   Christ cannot be suspected of falsehood or error either in His Divine
   Character or in His perfect Human Character and, therefore, the basis
   of our confidence cannot be shaken. Our rest must be found entirely in
   that grand Word of God,

   "I say unto you." The weight of yours doubt, if you have any, must fall
   upon His personal Character and there, also, the stress of yours faith
   must be fixed.

   If Jesus speak the Truth of God, then the Believer has everlasting
   life. If the Believer questions whether he has life or not, he
   questions the veracity of Christ. We are bound by our discipleship to
   be at rest. Happiness becomes a duty and peace a matter of obligation.
   Happy are the men who are under bonds to be joyful! We are partakers of
   eternal life! We come not into condemnation! What delight, what peace
   flows through our spirits if it is, indeed so, that we have commenced
   the same life which is to be developed in eternal glory! Then what
   gratitude ought to fill us and how that gratitude should urge us to
   holiness and to perfect obedience to Him who has given us this
   inestimable blessing!

   Come, let us not play with these things, but act as it behooves us to
   act, seeing that these things are, indeed, so. If they were mere myths
   or dreams, we might treat them carelessly. But accepting them as true,
   let us feel the force of their truth and let us rejoice this day in Him
   who has called us with so high a calling! One thing I want you to
   notice, and that is that our Lord does not desire us to keep this
   doctrine in the background. This doctrine that, "whoever believes in
   Him has everlasting life," is not only for our own private comfort--it
   is to be proclaimed upon our housetops!

   Those Jews in Christ's day were a company of cross-grained
   fault-finders who picked holes in Him about everything and nothing.
   Very harpies were they--full of spite at His excellence. They had just
   been finding fault with His healing a man on the Sabbath and He had
   answered them out straight without reserve. And when He had their ear,
   He told them a Truth of God which would cut them to the quick. It was
   not a wanton casting of pearls before swine and yet they were not
   worthy to hear so Divine a Truth!

   Jesus tells it to them that we may tell it to all. Never let us conceal
   what Jesus thus unveiled. There stands the precious Master and He says,
   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you quarrelsome Jews whose groveling
   minds cannot comprehend Me, that he that believes in Me has everlasting
   life. Your hands even now are near the ground seeking for stones to
   hurl at Me, but I say it to you as a thing I mean you to know, even if
   you gnash your teeth over it, that he that believes in Me has
   everlasting life." Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, let that be our answer
   to the present critical age! Let us turn the bulls-eye of our lantern
   full in its face! Let us cry again and again, "Believe in Jesus and
   live!"

   They will reply to you with philosophical deduction and learned
   quibble--and they will dig all sorts of pits for you, hoping to entrap
   you. Never mind their pits, or their quibbles, or their deductions!
   Just go on telling out the Truth of God that, "whoever believes in
   Jesus has everlasting life." But why tell it to these Jews that were so
   angry with Him? Perhaps some of them would be converted by it! Tell it
   to all men with this view, for the Gospel often begets faith in violent
   opposers. But if they were not converted, they would be left without
   excuse and this is something. Whatever may come of it, this Truth of
   God is meant to be written across the brow of Heaven! It is to be
   published throughout all nations, that all may know it!

   One of our ministers, years ago, traveling by coach, asked an erroneous
   preacher who was on the same coach this question--"How is a sinner
   justified in the sight of God?" This gentleman replied, "Ah, I know
   you! If I were to let you know my views, you would put them in your
   sermon and spread them all over England." "Ah," cried our friend, "you
   are ashamed of yours notions, are you? Well, I will give you the answer
   and I will be very glad if you will put it in all your lectures and
   publish it all the world over--man is justified in the sight of God by
   faith in the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ." Our doctrine is
   not special truth for the elite and initiated to be dubiously taught in
   a back room among a handful of students! It is the everlasting Gospel
   and we wish to have it proclaimed in markets and streets--before
   learned Brahmins and ignorant Hottentots! We would have it told out in
   the back slums of London and preached before lords and ladies and
   royalty itself! It does not matter where--salvation by faith is never
   out of place. This is a doctrine never to be covered up, nor veiled,
   nor qualified. "He that believes in Him has everlasting life!" Out with
   it and hesitate not!

   It is a pretty thing which is told of the father of Mr. Newman Hall and
   the author of, "The Sinner's Friend," that his common seal that he
   always delighted to use was a crown with an anchor fixed into it, with
   just these words, "Other refuge have I none." Well, if you do not use
   that seal; if you do not write the words over the door of yours house,
   yet take care that you bear their meaning in your hearts! Have my text
   written in your hearts by the Spirit of God so that you are sure and
   certain of it beyond all doubt! And also do so glory over it that you
   never hesitate on any occasion to confess that you are saved by faith
   in Christ Jesus!

   Dear Hearers, do you really know this Truth of God in your own souls?
   Have you believed in Jesus, or have you not? Are any of you trying to
   establish a righteousness of yours own? Are you laboring as in the very
   fire to get peace where you will never find it? Oh, come away from your
   ceremonies and your sacraments! Come away from your feelings! Come
   away, even, from your prayers and your almsgiving! Come away from
   everything upon which you rely and believe in Jesus, the appointed
   Savior! Come away, even, from your own faith, for you must not rely
   upon it! Come and trust only in Jesus, who, being very God of very God,
   made Himself of no reputation and took upon Himself the form of a
   Servant and in that Servant form bled, even, to the death in the
   sinner's place, that whoever will trust Him may be justified in the
   sight of God!

   Rest there, one and all of you. Oh may God help you at this very moment
   to do so and then we will meet in Heaven, all of us! If there is no
   exception to the believing, there shall be no exception in the
   salvation, for, "He that believes in Him has everlasting life."

Our Lord's Trial before the Sanhedrin

   (No. 1643)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 5, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they all condemned Him to be guilty of death." Mark 14:64.

   THIS one sentence is selected because custom demands a text. But in
   reality we shall follow the entire narrative of our Lord's trial before
   the High Priests. We shall see how the Sanhedrin arrived at their
   unrighteous sentence and what they did afterwards, and so, in a sense,
   we shall be keeping to our text. We have just been reading three
   passages--John 23:12- 24; Mark 14:53-65 and Luke 22:66-71. Please carry
   these in your minds while I rehearse the mournful story. The narrative
   of our Lord's grief, if it is carefully studied, is harrowing in the
   extreme. One cannot long think of it without tears. In fact, I have
   personally known what it is to be compelled to leave my meditations
   upon it from excess of emotion.

   It is enough to make one's heart fully break to realize the sufferings
   of such an One, so lovely in Himself and so loving toward us. Yet this
   harrowing of the feelings is exceedingly useful and the after result of
   it is truly admirable. After mourning for Jesus we are raised above our
   mourning! There is no consolation under Heaven at all like it, for the
   sorrows of Christ seem to take the sting out of our own sorrows till
   they become harmless and endurable. A sympathetic contemplation of our
   Lord's grief so dwarfs our griefs that they are reckoned to be but
   light afflictions, too petty, too insignificant to be mentioned in the
   same day. We dare not write ourselves down in the list of the sorrowful
   at all when we have just seen the sharp pains of the Man of Sorrows.
   The wounds of Jesus distil a balm which heals all mortal ills.

   Nor is this all, though that were much in a world of woe like this, but
   there is a matchless stimulus about the passion of the Lord. Though you
   have been almost crushed by the sight of yours Lord's agonies, you have
   risen from them strong, resolute, fervent, consecrated. Nothing stirs
   our hearts' depths like His heart's anguish. Nothing is too hard for us
   to attempt or to endure for One who sacrificed Himself for us. To be
   reviled for His dear sake who suffered such shame for us becomes no
   great affliction--even reproach, itself, when borne for Him, becomes
   greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt! To suffer in body and
   in mind, even unto death, for Him, were rather a privilege than an
   exaction--such love so swells our hearts that we vehemently pant for
   some way of expressing our indebtedness. We are grieved to think that
   our best will be so little, but we are solemnly resolved to give
   nothing less than our best to Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.

   I believe, also, that full often careless hearts have been greatly
   affected by the sufferings of Jesus. They have been disturbed in their
   indifference, convinced of their ingratitude, weaned from their love of
   sin and attracted to Christ by hearing what He bore on their behalf. No
   loadstone can draw human hearts like the Cross of Christ. His wounds
   cause even hearts of stone to bleed! His shame makes obstinacy, itself,
   ashamed. Men never so plentifully fall before the great bow of God as
   when its arrows are dipped in the blood of Jesus. Those darts which are
   armed with His agonies cause wounds such as never can be healed except
   by His own pierced hands. These are the weapons which slay the sin and
   save the sinner--killing, at one stroke, both his self-confidence and
   his despair--and leaving him a captive to that Conqueror whose glory it
   is to make men free!

   This morning I would not only preach the doctrines that come out of the
   Cross, but the Cross, itself. I suppose that was one of the great
   differences between the first preaching of all and the preaching after
   the Reformation. After the Reformation we had clearly ringing out from
   all pulpits the Doctrine of Justification by Faith and other glorious
   Truths of God which I hope will be made more and more prominent. But
   the first fathers of the Church set forth the same Truths in a less
   theological fashion. If they dwell little upon Justification by Faith
   they were wonderfully full upon the blood and its cleansing power, the
   wounds and their healing efficacy, the death of Jesus and our eternal
   life.

   We will go back to their style for a while and preach the facts about
   our Lord Jesus Christ rather than the doctrinal inferences from them.
   Oh, that the Holy Spirit would so bring the sorrows of our Lord near to
   each heart, that every one of us may know the fellowship of His
   sufferings and possess faith in His salvation and reverent love for
   Him!

   I. We will begin our narrative, this morning, by first asking you to
   think of THE PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF OUR BLESSED LORD AND MASTER BY
   THE HIGH PRIESTS. They brought in our Lord from the garden, bound, but
   they also kept fast hold upon Him, for we read of, "the men that held
   Him." They were evidently afraid of their prisoner, even when they had
   Him entirely in their power. He was all gentleness and submission, but
   conscience made cowards of them all and they, therefore, took all a
   coward's care to hold Him in their grasp. As the court had not yet
   gathered in sufficient numbers for a general examination, the High
   Priest resolved that he would fill up the time by personally
   interrogating his prisoner.

   He commenced his malicious exercise. The High Priest asked Jesus
   concerning His disciples. We cannot tell what were the questions, but I
   suppose they were something like these--"How is it that You have
   gathered about You a band of men? What did they do with You? What was
   Your ultimate intention to do by their means? Who were they? Were they
   not a set of fanatics, or men discontented and ready for sedition?" I
   do not know how the crafty Caiaphas put his questions, but the Savior
   gave no reply to this particular enquiry. What could He have said if He
   had attempted to answer? Ah, Brothers and Sisters, what good could He
   have said of His disciples? We may be sure He would say no ill. He
   might have said, "Concerning My disciples, one of them has betrayed Me.
   He has still the blood-money in his hands which you gave him as My
   price. Another of them, down in the hall there, before the cock crows
   will deny that he ever knew Me and add oaths and cursing to his denial.
   And as for the rest, they have all forsaken Me and fled."

   Therefore our Lord said nothing concerning His disciples, for He will
   not become the accuser of His own, whom He came not to condemn, but to
   justify. The High Priest also asked Him concerning His doctrine. I
   suppose he said to Jesus, "What new teaching is this of Yours? Are we
   not sufficient to teach the people--the Scribes so learned in the Law,
   the Pharisees so attentive to ritual, the Sadducees so philosophical
   and speculative? Why need you intrude into this domain? I suppose You
   to be little more than a peasant's son--what is this strange teaching
   of Yours?" To this enquiry our Lord did answer and what a triumphant
   reply it was! Oh that we could always speak, when it is right to speak,
   as meekly and as wisely as He!

   He said, "I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue
   and in the Temple, where the Jews always resort and in secret I have
   said nothing. Why ask you Me? Ask them which heard Me what I have said
   unto them: behold, they know what I have said." Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, no reply to slander can be compared with a blameless life!
   Jesus had lived in the full blaze of day, where all could see, and yet
   He was able to challenge accusation and say, "Ask them which heard Me."
   Happy is the man who has no need to defend himself because his works
   and words are solid testimonials to his uprightness and goodness! Our
   Savior answered His interrogator very gently, but yet most effectually,
   by His appeal to facts.

   He stands before us the mirror of meekness and the paragon of
   perfection, with slander like a wounded snake writhing at His feet.
   What a delight to have this triumphant Pleader for our Advocate, to
   urge His own righteousness in our defense! None can impugn His absolute
   perfection and that perfection covers all His saints this day! Who
   shall accuse us, now that Jesus has undertaken to plead for us? This
   overwhelming answer, however, brought the Savior a blow from one of the
   officers of the court who stood by. Was not this a most shocking deed?
   Here was the first of a new order of assaults. Up to now we have not
   heard of strokes and blows--but now it is fulfilled--"They shall smite
   the Judge of Israel with a rod upon His cheek."

   This was the first of a long series of assaults. I wonder who the man
   was that struck the Master? I could wish that the Master's reply to him
   may have influenced his heart to repentance. But if not, it is certain
   that he led the van in personal assaults upon our Lord's Person--his
   impious hand first struck Him. Surely if he died in impenitence, the
   memory of that blow must remain as a never-dying worm within him. Today
   he cries, "I was the first to smite Him! I struck Him on the mouth with
   the palm of my hand." The old writers upon the Passion give us various
   details of the injuries inflicted upon the Savior by that blow, but we
   attach no importance to such traditions and, therefore, will not repeat
   them, but simply say that there was general belief in the Church that
   this blow was a very grievous one and caused the Savior much pain.

   Yet while He felt that blow and was, perhaps, half staggered by it, the
   Master did not lose His composure, or exhibit the least resentment. His
   reply was everything it ought to be. There is not a word too much. He
   does not say, "God shall smite you, you whited wall," as did the
   Apostle Paul. We will not censure the servant, but we will far more
   commend the Master. He meekly said, "If I have spoken evil, bear
   witness of the evil: but if well, why did you strike Me?" Enough,
   surely, if there remained any tenderness in the heart of the aggressor,
   to have made him turn his hand upon his own breast in penitential
   grief! One would not have wondered had he cried out, "Forgive me, O You
   divinely meek and gentle One, and let me, from now on, be Your
   disciple!"

   Thus have we seen the first part of our Lord's sufferings in the house
   of the High Priest. And the lesson from it is just this--Let us be meek
   and lowly in heart as the Savior was, for herein lay His strength and
   dignity. You tell me I have said that before. Yes, Brothers and
   Sisters, and I shall have to say it several more times before you and I
   have learned the lesson well. It is hard to be meek when falsely
   accused. It is difficult to be meek when roughly interrogated. It is
   hard to be meek when a cunning adversary is on the catch, or when
   smarting under a cruel blow which was a disgrace to a court of justice.

   You have heard of the patience of Job, but it pales before the patience
   of Jesus! Admire His forbearance, but do not stop at admiration--copy
   His example! Write under this headline and follow every stroke. O
   Spirit of God, even with Christ for an Example, we shall not learn
   meekness unless You teach us! And even with You for a Teacher, we shall
   not learn it unless we take His yoke upon us and learn of Him, for it
   is only at His feet; and under Your Divine anointing that we shall ever
   become meek and lowly of heart--and so find rest unto our souls. The
   preliminary examination is therefore over and it has ended in no
   success whatever for the High Priest. He has questioned Jesus and he
   has struck Him, but the ordeal brings nothing to content the adversary.
   The prisoner is supremely victorious, the assailant is baffled.

   II. Now comes a second scene, THE SEARCH FOR WITNESSES AGAINST HIM.
   "The chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus
   to put Him to death; and found none." A strange court that meets with
   the design to find the prisoner guilty, resolved in some way or other
   to compass his death! They must proceed according to the forms of
   justice and so they summon witnesses, though all the while they violate
   the spirit of justice, for they ransack Jerusalem to find witnesses who
   will perjure themselves to accuse the Lord!

   Every man of the council is writing down somebody's name who may be
   fetched in from the outside, for the people have come from all parts of
   the land to keep the Passover and surely some may be hunted up who, in
   one place or another, have heard Him use an objectionable mode of
   speech. They fetch in, therefore, everyone that they can find of that
   degraded class who will venture upon perjuring themselves if a bribe is
   forthcoming. They scour Jerusalem to bring forth witnesses against
   Jesus--but they had great difficulty in accomplishing their design
   because they were bound to examine the witnesses separately and they
   could not make them agree! Lies cannot be easily made to pair with each
   other, whereas truths are cut to the same pattern.

   Moreover, many sorts of witnesses that they could readily find, they
   did not dare to bring forward. Witnesses were forthcoming who could
   testify that Jesus had spoken against the tradition of the elders, but
   in that, some who were in the council, namely, the Sadducees, were
   agreed with Him to a large extent! It would never do to bring forward a
   charge about which they would not be unanimous. His denunciations of
   the Pharisees could not be the charge, for these pleased the Sadducees!
   Neither could they allege His outcry against the Sadducees, for in this
   the Pharisees were agreed with Him! You remember how Paul, when brought
   before this Sanhedrin, took advantage of their division of opinion and
   cried, "I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; of the hope and
   resurrection of the dead I am called in question"--and in this manner
   created a dissension among the conclave, which, for a time worked in
   his favor.

   Our Lord took higher and nobler ground and did not stoop to turn their
   folly to His own benefit. Yet, they being conscious of their internal
   feuds, cautiously avoided those points upon which they were not in
   harmony. They might have brought forward their old grievance that the
   Lord Jesus did not observe the Sabbath after their fashion, but then it
   would have come out more publicly that He had healed the sick on the
   Sabbath. It would not do to publish that fact, for who would think of
   putting a person to death for having opened the eyes of one born blind,
   or having restored a withered arm on the Sabbath? That kind of witness
   was, therefore, set aside.

   But might they not have found some witnesses to swear that He had
   talked about a kingdom that He was setting up? Might not this readily
   have been made to mean sedition and rebellion? Yes, but then that was
   rather a charge to allege

   against Him before Pilate's civil court, whereas theirs was an
   ecclesiastical tribunal. Moreover, there were Herodians in the council
   who were very restive under the Roman yoke and could not have had the
   face to condemn anyone for being a patriot. And besides, the people
   outside would have sympathized with Jesus all the more if they had
   supposed that He would lead them on a rebellion against Caesar.
   Therefore they could not urge that point.

   They must have been greatly puzzled to know what to do! Especially when
   even on those points which they decided to bring forward the witnesses,
   they no sooner opened their mouths than they contradicted each other!
   At last they had it. There came two whose evidence was somewhat agreed
   and they asserted that on a certain occasion Jesus Christ had said, "I
   will destroy this Temple that is made with hands, and within three days
   I will build another made without hands." Here was blasphemy against
   the holy and beautiful House of the Lord! This would serve their turn.
   Now, the Savior had said something which was a little like the
   testimony of these false witnesses and a misunderstanding had made it
   more like it. But still their statement was a lie and none the less a
   lie because a shadow of truth had fallen upon it, for the worst kind of
   lie is that which is manufactured out of a truth--it does a great deal
   more mischief than if it were a falsehood from stem to stern.

   The Savior had not said, "I will destroy this Temple." He said,
   "Destroy this Temple," that is to say, "You will destroy it and you may
   destroy it." He had not referred to the Jerusalem Temple at all--this
   spoke He concerning the Temple of His body which would be destroyed.
   Christ has never said, "Destroy this Temple which is made with hands,
   and I will build another without hands." In His language there is no
   allusion to hands at all. These refinements were of their own inventing
   and His language gave no color for them. He had not said, "I will build
   another." He had said, "I will raise it up," which is quite a different
   thing! He meant that His body, after being destroyed, would be raised
   up, again, on the third day. They had altered a word here and a word
   there, the mood of one verb and the form of another--and so they made
   out our Lord to say what He never thought of.

   Yet even on that charge they did not agree! One said one thing upon it
   and another said another, so that even this paltry accusation could not
   be brought against the Savior. Their patched-up falsehood was made of
   such rotten stuff that the pieces would not hold together! They were
   ready to swear to anything that came into their perjured imaginations,
   but they could not be gotten to swear, any two of them, to the same
   thing! Meanwhile the Lord Himself stands silent. Like the sheep before
   her shearers, He is dumb and opens not His mouth. And I suppose the
   reason was partly that He might fulfill the prophecy, partly because
   the grandeur of His soul could not stoop to contend with liars, but
   most of all because His innocence needed no defense!

   He that is in some measure guilty, is eager to apologize and to
   extenuate--his excuses usually suggest, to men of experience, the
   belief that there may be some ground for the accusation. He that is
   perfectly innocent is in no haste to answer his slanderers, for they
   soon answer one another! Our Lord did not desire to get into a vain
   jangle with them and so to lead them on to utter still more falsehoods.
   If speech can do no good then, indeed, silence is wise! When the only
   result would have been to provoke His enemies to add to their
   iniquities, it was magnanimous compassion which led the slandered
   Savior to hold His tongue.

   We must not refrain from noticing the comfort which, in some degree,
   had been ministered to our Lord by the accusation which came most to
   the front. He stands there and He knows they are about to put Him to
   death, but they, themselves, remind Him that their power over Him has
   no longer lease than three days. And at the end of that short time He
   will be raised up again, no more to be at their disposal! His enemies
   reminded Him of the Resurrection! I say not that His memory was weak,
   or that He would possibly have forgotten it and His sorrows, but yet
   our Lord was human and modes of comfort which are valuable to us were
   also useful to Him. When the mind is tortured with malicious falsehoods
   and the whole man is tossed about by pains and griefs, it is good for
   us to be reminded of the consolations of God.

   We read of some who were "tortured, not accepting deliverance," and it
   was the hope of Resurrection which sustained them! Our Lord knew that
   His soul would not be left in the abodes of the dead and neither should
   His flesh see corruption--and the false witnesses brought this vividly
   before His mind. Now, indeed, could our Redeemer say, "Destroy this
   Temple and in three days I will raise it up." These ravens have brought
   the Savior bread and meat! In these dead lions our glorious Samson has
   found honey! Sustained by the joy that was set before Him, He despises
   the shame! Strange that out of the mouths of those who sought His blood
   there should come the memory of one of His greatest glories!

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, here, again, we learn the same lesson as
   before, namely, let us gain meekness and by it our power to hold our
   tongues. Eloquence is difficult to acquire, but silence is far more
   difficult to practice. A man may much sooner learn to speak well than
   learn not to speak at all. We are in such a hurry to vindicate our own
   cause that we damage it by rash speech! If we were calm, gentle, quiet,
   forbearing as the Savior was, our pathway to victory would be much
   easier. Observe, again, the armor with which Christ was clad--see the
   invulnerable shield of His holiness! His life was such that slander
   could not frame an accusation against Him which would last long enough
   to be repeated. So frail were the charges that, like bubbles, they
   vanished as soon as they saw the light! Our Lord's enemies were utterly
   baffled. They hurled their darts against Him, but, as if they fell upon
   a shield of blazing diamond, every arrow was broken and consumed!

   Learn, also, this other lesson that we must expect to be
   misrepresented. We may reckon that our words will have other meanings
   to ungracious ears than those which we intended. We may expect that
   when we teach one thing which is true, they will make us out to have
   stated another which is false. But let us not be overwhelmed by this
   fiery trial as though it were some strange thing! Our Lord and Master
   has endured it and the servants must not escape it! Therefore endure
   hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ and be not afraid! Amid the
   din of these lies and perjuries, I hear the still small voice of a
   Truth of God most precious, for like as Jesus stood for us at the bar
   and they could not cause an accusation to abide upon Him, so when we
   shall stand in Him at the Last Great Day, washed in His blood and
   covered with His righteousness, we, too, shall be clear!

   "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" If Satan should
   appear as the accuser of the Brethren, he will be met by the voice,
   "The Lord rebuke you, O Satan, even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem
   rebuke you!" "Is not this a brand plucked out of the burning?" Yes,
   Beloved, we, too, shall be cleared of slander. Then shall the righteous
   shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father! The glorious
   righteousness of Him who was falsely accused shall deliver the saints
   and all iniquity shall stop her mouth!

   III. But I must not dwell too long even on such themes as these and,
   therefore, I pass on to THE PERSONAL INTERROGATION which followed upon
   the failure to bring forward witnesses. The High Priest, too indignant
   to sit still, rises and stands over the Prisoner like a lion roaring
   over his prey and begins to question Him again. It was an unrighteous
   thing to do. Should the judge who sits to administer law set himself to
   prove the prisoner guilty? Or, what is worse, shall he try to extort a
   confession from the accused which may be used against him? It was a
   tacit confession that Christ had been proven innocent up till then.

   The High Priest would not have needed to draw something out of the
   accused One if there had been sufficient material against Him
   elsewhere. The trial had been a dead failure up to that point and he
   knew it! And he was red with rage. Now he attempts to bully the
   Prisoner that he may extract some declaration from Him which may save
   all further trouble of witnesses and end the matter. The question was
   forced home by a solemn adjuration and it effected its purpose, for the
   Lord Jesus did speak, though He knew that He was, thereby, furnishing a
   weapon against Himself. He felt under bond to answer the High Priest of
   His people when He used such adjuration, evil man as that High Priest
   was. And He could not draw back from a charge so solemn lest He should
   seem, by His silence, to deny the truth upon which the salvation of the
   world is made to hinge.

   So when the High Priest asked Him, "Are You the Christ, the Son of the
   Blessed?" How distinctly and outspoken was the Master's reply. Though
   He knew that His death would thus be compassed, He witnessed a good
   confession. He plainly said, "I am," and then He added to that
   declaration, "You shall see the Son of Man"--so He brings out His
   humanity as well as His Deity--"sitting on the right hand of power and
   coming in the clouds of Heaven." What a majestic faith! It is wonderful
   to think that He should be so calm as to confront His mockers and
   assert His Glory while He was in the depths of shame! He did as good as
   say, "You sit as My judges, but I shall soon sit as your Judge! I seem
   to you to be an insignificant peasant, but I am the Son of the Blessed!
   You think that you will crush Me, but you never will, for I shall
   speedily sit at the right hand of the power of God and come in the
   clouds of Heaven."

   He speaks boldly, as well became Him. I admire the meekness that could
   be silent. I admire the meekness that could speak gently, but I still
   wonder more at the meekness that could speak courageously and still be
   meek! Somehow or other, when we awaken ourselves to courage, we let in
   harshness in the same door, or if we shut out our anger, we are very
   apt to forget our firmness. Jesus never slays one virtue to make room
   for another. His Character is complete, full-

   orbed, perfect, whichever way we look at it. And surely, Brothers and
   Sisters, this must have brought another sweet consolation to our divine
   Master's heart. While smarting under that cruel blow; while writhing
   under those filthy accusations; while enduring such contradiction of
   sinners against Himself, He must have felt satisfied from within in the
   consciousness of His Sonship and His power--and in the prospect of His
   Glory and triumph!

   A well of water springs up within His soul as He foresees that He shall
   sit at the right hand of God and that He shall judge the quick and the
   dead and vindicate His redeemed. It is a wise thing to have these
   consolations always ready to hand. The enemy may not see their
   consolatory power, but we see it. To us, from beneath the altar, there
   issues forth a stream whose gentle flow supplies our spirits with a
   quiet gladness such as all earth's waters can never rival. Even now we
   also hear the Father say, "I am your shield and your exceeding great
   reward." Notice, before we pass away from this point, that,
   practically, the trial and the interrogation ended in our Lord's being
   condemned because of His avowal of His Deity. They said, "You have
   heard the blasphemy: what do you think? And they all condemned Him to
   be guilty of

   death."

   I cannot make out at all those people who call themselves Unitarians
   and deny our Lord's Deity. Unitarians we also are, for we believe in
   one God, and only one God--but they tell us that this blessed Christ,
   our Master, is not God! And yet they admit that He was the most
   excellent of men, the most perfect of human beings! I cannot see it
   myself. He seems to me to be a blasphemer and nothing else, if He is
   not God--and the Jews evidently held that opinion and treated Him
   accordingly. If he had not said that God was His Father, they would not
   have been so enraged against Him. They put Him to death because of the
   assertion of His Deity--and the declaration that He would sit at the
   right hand of power and judge the world.

   Today multitudes are willing to take Christ as a teacher, but they will
   not have Him as the Son of God. I do not doubt that the Christian
   religion might be received in many places if it were shorn of its
   Strength--if, in fact, its very soul and heart were torn out of it by
   setting forth Jesus as one of the Prophets and nothing more. Hear how
   our wise men talk of Him as one of a line of great reformers, such as
   Moses, Samuel, Elijah--and they often add Confucius and Mohammed. Do we
   give place to this? No, not for an instant! He is verily the Son of the
   Blessed. He is Divine or false! The accusation of blasphemy must lie
   against Him if He is not the Son of the Highest!

   IV. We must now pass on and linger for a second or two over THE
   CONDEMNATION. They condemned Him out of His own mouth--but this, while
   it wore the semblance of justice, was really unjust. The Prisoner at
   the bar has affirmed that He is the Son of God. What next? May He not
   speak the truth? If it is the truth, He must not be condemned, but
   adored! Justice requires that an enquiry be made as to whether He is
   the Christ, the Son of the Blessed, or not. He has claimed to be the
   Messiah. Very well, all those in the court are expecting the
   Messiah--some of them expect Him to appear very speedily. May not this
   be the Sent One of the Lord?

   Let an enquiry be made into His claims! What is His lineage? Where was
   He born? Have any Prophets attested Him? Has He worked miracles? Some
   such enquiries are due to any man whose life is at stake! You cannot
   justly condemn a man to die without examining into the truth of his
   defense, for it may turn out that his statements are correct. But, no,
   they will not hear the Man they hate! The mere claim condemns Him--it
   is blasphemy and He must die. He says He is the Son of God. Come, then,
   Caiaphas and council, call for witnesses for the defense! Enquire
   whether blind eyes have been opened and the dead raised up! Ask whether
   He has worked miracles such as no man ever worked in the midst of
   Israel throughout all time! Why not do this? O no, He must be taken
   from prison and from judgment--and none shall declare His generation.
   The less enquiry the more easy to condemn Him unjustly!

   He has said He is the Christ and the Son of God--He is therefore guilty
   of death. Alas, how many there are who condemn Christ's doctrine
   without making due enquiries into it--condemn it on the most trivial
   grounds! They come to hear a sermon and perhaps find fault with the
   mannerism of the preacher, as if that were sufficient reason for
   denying the Truth of God which he preaches! Or else they say, "This is
   so strange--we cannot believe it." Why not? Are not strange things
   sometimes true and is not many a truth wondrously strange until you get
   familiar with it? These men will not condescend to hear Christ's proof
   of claim--they will make no enquiry! In this, like the Jewish priests,
   they practically cry, "Away with Him! Away with Him!"

   He is condemned to die and the High Priest tears his clothes. I do not
   know whether he wore, at that time, the robes in which he ministered,
   but doubtless he wore some garb peculiar to his sacerdotal office--and
   this he tore. Oh, how

   significant! The house of Aaron and the tribe of Levi had their
   garments torn and the Temple, within a few hours, tore its veil from
   the top to the bottom--for priests and temple were, alike, abolished!
   They little knew it, but in all they did there was a singular
   significance--those torn garments were an index of the fact that now
   the Aaronic priesthood was forever torn--and the great Melchisedec
   priesthood had come in, for the true Melchisidec, then and there, stood
   before them in all the majesty of His patience!

   Observe that they were all agreed. There was no dissention--they had
   taken care, I have no doubt--not to let Nico-demus and Joseph of
   Arimathaea know anything about this meeting of theirs. They held it in
   the night and they only rehearsed it in the early morning for the sake
   of keeping their old Rabbinical Law that they must try prisoners by
   daylight. They hurried up the trial and any that might have spoken
   against their bloodthirsty sentence were kept out of the way. The
   assembly was unanimous! Alas for the unanimity of ungodly hearts
   against Christ! It is amazing that there should be such quarrels among
   Christ's friends and such unity among His foes, when the point is to
   put Him to death! I never heard of quarrels among devils, nor did I
   ever read of sects or denominations in Hell--they are all one in their
   hatred of the Christ and of God!

   But here are we split up into sections and parties and often at war
   with one another. O Lord of Love, forgive us! King of Concord, come and
   reign over us and bring us into a perfect unity around Yourself. The
   sentence was "death." I say nothing of it but this. Death was the
   sentence due to me, the sentence due to you--and they laid it upon our
   Substitute. "Worthy of death"--they said--all of them. All hands were
   held up. All voices said, "Yes, yes" to the verdict. Yet there was no
   fault in Him! Say rather, there was every excellence in Him! As I hear
   Jesus condemned to die, my soul falls at His feet and cries, "Blessed
   Lord, now have You taken my condemnation. There is, therefore, none for
   me. Now have You taken my cup of death to drink, and from now on it is
   dry to me. Glory be to Your blessed name, from now on and forever."

   V. I am almost glad that my time is so far advanced, for I must set
   before you the fifth and most painful scene. No sooner have these evil
   men of the Sanhedrin pronounced Him guilty of death, than the servants,
   the guards and those that kept the High Priests' hall, eager to please
   their masters, and all touched with the same brute-like spirit which
   was in them, straightway began to abuse the Infinite Majesty of our
   Lord. Consider THE ABUSE. Let me read the words-- "Some began to spit
   on Him." "Began to spit on Him!" Thus was contempt expressed more
   effectively than by words. Be astonished, O heavens, and be horribly
   afraid! His face is the Light of the universe! His Person is the Glory
   of Heaven-- and they "began to spit on Him!"

   ' Alas, my God, that man should be so base! Some went further and they,
   "covered His face." It is an Eastern custom to cover the face of the
   condemned, as if they were not fit to see the light, nor fit to behold
   their fellow men. I know not whether, for this reason, or in pure
   mockery, they covered His face so that they could not see it, and He
   could not see them. How could they thus put out the sun and shut up
   bliss? Then when all was dark to Him, we read that they began to say,
   "Prophesy, Who is he that struck You?" Then another did the same and
   many were the cruel cuffs they laid about His blessed face. The
   mediaeval writers delighted to talk about the teeth that were broken,
   the bruises on the checks, the blood which flowed, the flesh that was
   bruised and blackened--but we dare not thus imagine.

   Scripture has cast a veil and there let it abide. Yet it must have been
   an awful sight to see the Lord of Glory with His face stained by their
   accursed spit and bruised with their cruel fists. Here insult and
   cruelty were combined--ridicule of His prophetic claims and dishonor to
   His Divine Person. Nothing was thought bad enough. They invented all
   they could of shame and scorn--and He stood patient--though a single
   flash of His eyes would have consumed them in a moment! Brothers,
   Sisters, this is what our sin deserved! A shameful thing are you, O
   Sin! You deserve to be spit upon! This is what sin is constantly doing
   to Christ! Whenever you and I sin, we do, as it were, spit in His face.
   We also hide His eyes by trying to forget that He sees us and we also
   hit Him whenever we transgress and grieve His Spirit.

   Talk not of cruel Jews. Let us think of ourselves and let us be humbled
   by the thought! This is what the ungodly world is always doing to our
   blessed Master. They also would hide His eyes which are the Light of
   the world. They also despise His Gospel and spit upon it as an utterly
   worn out and worthless thing. They also do despite to the members of
   His body through His poor afflicted saints who have to bear slander and
   abuse for His dear sake. And yet over all this I seem to see a light
   most blessed. Christ must be spit upon, for He has taken our sin.
   Christ must be tortured, for He is standing in our place. Who is to be
   the executioner of all this grief? Who shall take upon himself the
   office of putting

   Christ to shame? Our redemption was being worked out this way--who
   shall be the judge to perform this miserable work?

   Fling in the clusters richer than the grapes of Eshcol! Fling them in,
   but who shall tread them out and laboriously extract the wine, the
   generous wine which cheers God and man? The feet shall be the willing
   feet of Christ's own adver-saries--they shall extort from Him that
   which shall redeem us and destroy all evil! I rejoice to see Satan
   outwitted and his malice made to be the means of his own overthrow! He
   thinks to destroy Christ and by that deed he destroys himself! He pulls
   down evil upon his own head and falls into the pit which he has dug.
   Thus shall all evil always work for the good of the Lord's people! Yes,
   their greatest good shall often come out of that which threatened their
   ruin and worked in them the utmost anguish. Three days must the Christ
   suffer and die and lie in the grave. But after that He must bruise the
   serpent's head and lead captivity captive! And that by the means of the
   very suffering and shame which He is now enduring! In the same manner
   shall it happen to His mystical body and Satan shall be bruised under
   our feet shortly.

   I leave this subject, hoping that you will pursue it in your
   meditations, Here are three observations. First, how ready should we be
   to bear slander and ridicule for Jesus' sake. Do not get into a huff
   and think it a bad thing that people should mock you. Who are you, dear
   Brothers and Sisters? Who are you? What can you be if compared with
   Christ? If they spat upon Him, why should they not spit upon you? If
   they buffeted Him, why should they not buffet you? Shall your Master
   have all the rough of it? Shall He have all the bitter and you all the
   sweet? A pretty soldier, you, to demand better fare than your Captain!

   How earnestly, next, ought we to honor our dear Lord. If men were so
   eager to put Him to shame, let us be 10 times more earnest to bring Him
   glory! Is there anything we can do, today, by which He may be honored?
   Let us set about it! Can we make any sacrifice? Can we perform any
   difficult task which would glorify Him? Let us not deliberate, but at
   once do it with all our might! Let us be inventive in modes of
   glorifying Him, even as His adversaries were ingenious in the methods
   of His shame.

   Lastly, how surely and how sweetly may all who believe in Him come and
   rest their souls in His hands. Surely know that He who suffered this,
   since He was verily the Son of the Blessed, must have ability to save
   us! Such griefs must be a full atonement for our transgressions! Glory
   be to God, that spit on His face means a clear, bright face for me!
   Those false accusations on His Character mean no condemnation for me!
   That putting Him to death proves the certainty of our text last Sunday
   morning, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believes on Me has
   everlasting life."

   Let us sweetly rest in Jesus and if ever our faith is agitated, let us
   get away to the hall of Caiaphas and see the Just standing for the
   unjust, the Faultless One bearing condemnation for sinners! Let us, in
   the High Priest's hall, judge and condemn every sin and every
   doubt--and come forth glorying that the Christ has conquered for
   us--and that we now wait with delight for His appearing! God bless you,
   Brothers and Sisters, for Christ's sake. Amen.

Our Lord's First Appearance before Pilate

   (No. 1644)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 12, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Pilate said unto them, I find in Him no fault at all." John 18:38.

   I SHOULD like, if God spares us, to present to you on Sabbath mornings
   the full story of our Savior's sufferings. We began last Lord's Day by
   going with Him to the hall of Caiaphas and it was a sadly solemn time
   when we beheld the Prince of Peace a prisoner, heard Him falsely
   accused and unjustly condemned. And then we saw Him abused till
   servants and subjects did spit in His face and make a mockery of Him. I
   hope that you will not be wearied with this subject. If so, it will be
   the fault of the preacher, for the subject is always full and fresh. Or
   if the preacher is not to blame, there will be something of censure due
   to his hearers. If we grow tired of the story of the Cross it will be a
   sad indication of secret soul-sickness and it will be well to observe
   the symptom and hasten to the great Physician for healing.

   To true saints in a healthy condition there is no place more attractive
   than the place of our Lord's passion, where He accomplished the
   glorious work of our redemption. They love to linger along that Via
   Dolorosa which leads from Geth-semane to Golgotha--let us linger with
   them! When I stand and view my Lord, like the bush in Horeb, burning
   but not consumed, I hear a Voice saying to me, "The place where you
   stand is holy ground." Nothing is more holy than the Person of our
   Divine Master! It is, therefore, well to be with Him. The anguish which
   He endured when He devoted Himself as a Sacrifice for us is holy, too,
   and so it is well to be with Him in His sufferings. His sorrows have a
   most sanctifying influence upon all who consider them with believing
   love.

   I am persuaded that if we lived more in the atmosphere of the Cross,
   sin would lose its power and every Grace would flourish. When we draw
   very near to Jesus and have fellowship with Him in His sufferings, we
   raise a hue and cry against the sin which slew Him and resolve to be
   revenged upon it by departing from it, ourselves, and by warring
   against it whenever we see it in others. The Cross is that holy
   implement with which we make war with sin till it is utterly destroyed.
   Blessed and holy, then, are the thoughts which are awakened by our
   great Sacrifice. Nor is it only so, but the medicine which brings us
   health is, in itself, a joy--

   "Sweet the moments, rich in blessing, Which before the Cross I spend,
   Life, and health, and peace possessing, In the sinner's dying Friend."

   There is no noise as of them that make merry over their wine, no shout
   of them that triumph, no song of them that feast--but here is a
   grave--sweet melody as of hearts that have found rest. At the Cross we
   find a substantial joy, a far-reaching satisfaction, "the peace of God,
   which passes all understanding." Here, you restless ones, is the cure
   of restlessness! Here shall you say, "O God, my heart is fixed, my
   heart is fixed. I will sing and give praise." I shall not, therefore,
   make any excuse, even if for weeks to come I should lead you to the
   place of dragons where your Lord was sorely broken and help you to
   drink of His cup and to be baptized with His Baptism. May the Spirit of
   God come upon and open our eyes to read the sacred heart of Him whose
   sorrows are unrivalled--sorrows borne for love of us!

   Let us go to the narrative at once with loving and lowly carefulness.
   Our Lord was condemned by the chief priests for blasphemy because He
   declared Himself to be the Son of God and told them that they should
   hereafter see Him coming in the clouds of Heaven to be their Judge.
   Tearing his garments, the High Priest said, "What need have we of any
   further witness? You have heard His blasphemy." When the morning light
   had come and they had gone through the formality of a set trial by
   daylight--having really condemned Him in the night--they led Jesus away
   to Pilate.

   According to tradition, He was led with a rope about His neck and His
   hands bound. And I can fully believe in the tradition when I remember
   the words of Isaiah--"He was led as a sheep to the slaughter." It was a
   strangely sad proces-

   sion which moved through Jerusalem a little after six in the morning.
   Those men of the Sanhedrin, in all their pomp and power surrounding
   this one poor Victim, whom they were about to deliver to the Gentiles
   with the one design that He might be put to death! Those wicked men of
   pride were as the dogs of whom the Psalmist sang when the hind of the
   morning was his tender theme.

   When they came to the house of the Roman governor, they would not,
   themselves, enter within its doors. It is said to have been one of the
   many magnificent palaces which Herod the Great built for himself. The
   architecture was gorgeous, the floors were inlaid with choice marble
   and all the chambers were richly gilded and furnished with Oriental
   splendor. Into the great hall these scrupulous hypocrites would not
   enter because they must, by no means, be defiled by the touch of a
   Gentile for they had already commenced to keep the Passover. So they
   waited in the courtyard and Pilate condescended to come out to them and
   learn the pressing business which brought them there so early in the
   morning.

   The Roman governor was proud, cruel and abhorred the Jews. But still,
   knowing their fanaticism and the readiness with which they broke loose
   at Passover times, he stood at his palace gate and heard their demands.
   He soon ascertained that they had brought him a prisoner, evidently a
   poor man, and in personal appearance emaciated, weary and suffering.
   About Him there was a mysterious dignity combined with singular
   gentleness and Pilate, for this and other reasons, evidently took a
   singular interest in Him. Fixing his gaze, first, upon the
   extraordinary Prisoner, he turned to the angry priests and demanded,
   "What accusation do you bring against this Man?

   The one objective of the priests in bringing Jesus to Pilate was to get
   Him put to death, for when Pilate told them to go and judge Him
   according to their Law, they replied that they would gladly do so, but
   that the power of life and death had been taken from them, implying
   that nothing but His death would content them. They were, however, very
   anxious at this stage to lay the responsibility of His death upon the
   Romans. The fear of the people was still upon them and if they could
   secure his death by Pilate, then they might, in later days, protest
   that they merely handed Him over to the Roman governor and could not
   foresee that He would be handled so roughly.

   They had not yet bribed the populace to cry, "Crucify Him," and they
   were willing to be on the safe side should the people make an uproar on
   His behalf. Humanly speaking, they could have put Him to death
   themselves, for He was entirely in their power and they frequently
   forgot the Roman law and slew men in riotous fury, as when they stoned
   Stephen. They had frequently attempted to stone our Lord, Himself, so
   that they were not always so mindful of Roman law! They might have
   taken His life on this occasion, but they were led by a mysterious
   impulse to desire that the actual responsibility of the deed should
   rest on Pilate.

   Further on they were willing to join with the fickle throng in sharing
   the guilt of His blood, but as yet they would gladly throw it upon
   others. During their great festivals, if they took innocent blood,
   their hypocrisy made them wish to do it by forms of law and by an alien
   hand. To do this they must bring an accusation, for no Roman ruler
   would condemn a man till an accusation had been made. We shall, this
   morning, consider the two accusations that they brought. And after that
   we shall hear the verdict of acquittal which Pilate gave in the
   language of the text, "I find in Him no fault at all."

   I. The first accusation, if you will turn to the chapter and read the
   30th verse, was that our Master was A MALEFACTOR. "They answered and
   said unto Him, If He were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered
   Him up to you." He was said to be a malefactor, or doer of that which
   is evil--a person of such a mischievous life that He ought not to live.
   Upon which we remark, first, that it was a novel charge! It was hot
   from their mint, for when He stood before Caiaphas nothing was said of
   any evil that He had done, but only of evil that He had spoken. They
   charged Him with saying this and that, but not with doing any evil
   deed. The accusation of evil speaking had broken down and they did not
   venture upon it a second time because they knew very well that Pilate
   did not care what the man had said--all he would attend to would be
   some actual breach of law by act and deed.

   The Romans were a practical people and so when Pilate led our Lord into
   the audience chamber, he said to Him, "What have You done?" He did not
   say to Him, "What have You taught or preached?" but, "What have You
   done?" For this reason, the priests brought forward this newly-invented
   accusation and totally unfounded charge that He was a bad doer, which
   might mean little or much, as the hearer chose to interpret it-- malice
   is seldom specific in its charges. The accusation of being a malefactor
   grew out of their malevolence and not out of any action of our Lord's
   perfect life.

   One is surprised that even hate should be so blind as to assail His
   perfections! Whatever men may think of our Lord as a teacher, candor
   demands that they admire His example and award it the highest need of
   honor.

   Observe, the priests herein brought against our Lord a charge which
   they did not attempt to sustain. How craftily they evaded the task of
   supplying proof! They brought no witnesses, their evil perjurers were
   left behind. They even refrained from specific charges, but the general
   statement that He was a malefactor was supported only by their
   reputation. "If He were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered
   Him up to you," as much as to say, "You must take it for granted that
   He is guilty, or we would not say so. Here is our High Priest--can it
   be supposed that such a gem of an individual would bring a false
   accusation? We also are the chief priests and the scribes, and teachers
   of Israel--can it be imagined that persons of our station and sanctity
   could by any possibility have brought an innocent person before you to
   be condemned!"

   This style of argument I have heard even in these days--we are expected
   to give up the faith because scientists condemn it--and they are such
   eminent persons that we ought to accept their dicta without further
   delay! I confess I am not prepared to accept their infallibility any
   more than that which hails from Rome! The Roman governor was not to be
   overridden by priests, neither are we to be led by the nose by
   pretended learned men. "If He were not a malefactor, we would not have
   delivered Him up to you." Oh, the hypocrisy of this talk! They had
   tried to bring witnesses, but no witness had been found. They had hired
   false witnesses, but these had so differed in their testimony that the
   whole thing broke down. They, therefore, go upon another tack and put
   their own names at the back of the indictment, as if that were quite
   enough and enquiry need go no further.

   I think I see the scornful glance of Pilate as he bade them judge Him,
   themselves, if that was their style ofjustice. As for him, he must hear
   an accusation or dismiss them to do their own pleasure if they dare. He
   knew that through envy they had brought Jesus to him and he loathed the
   hypocrites as he heard the wretched syllables sibilating from their
   sanctimonious lips! They could not have sustained the charge and, so
   far, they were wise in not attempting the impossible. They might be
   foolhardy enough to wrest His words, but they hesitated before the task
   of attacking His deeds. Before His awful holiness they were, for the
   moment, out of heart and knew not what slander to invent. O Lord, we
   marvel that any men should find fault with You, for You are altogether
   lovely and there is in You no spot for falsehood to light upon!

   But I want to call your attention to this remarkable fact, that
   although this charge of being a malefactor was a grievous one, a
   trumped-up one and unsustained by any evidence, yet it was never denied
   by the Lord Jesus Christ! It was useless to deny it before the priests.
   He had already challenged them to find fault with His life, saying, "I
   spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue and in the
   Temple, where the Jews always resort. And in secret have I said
   nothing. Why ask you Me? Ask them which heard Me what I have said unto
   them: behold, they know what I said." His appeal had been unavailing,
   for it was as useless to argue with them as for a lamb to enter into
   controversy with a pack of wolves eager to devour him.

   But there might have been some use, one would think, in his answering
   to Pilate, for Pilate was evidently very favorably impressed with his
   Prisoner--and if the Savior had deigned to give a full account of His
   life to prove that instead of being a malefactor He had gone about
   doing good--might He not have escaped? The answer is this--our Lord had
   come on earth on purpose to be the Substitute for guilty men and so
   when He was called a malefactor, although it was not a truthful charge,
   yet He patiently bore the shame of it, as it is written, "He was
   numbered with the transgressors." He was willing to stand in the
   transgressor's place and when they put Him there, He did not stir from
   it. "He is dumb, He opens not His mouth." He says nothing because,
   though in Him is no sin, He has taken our sin upon Himself!

   The question that Pilate put, "What have You done?" was one which Jesus
   might have grandly answered--"What have I done? I have fed the hungry,
   I have healed the sick, I have raised the fallen, I have restored the
   dead. What have I done? I have lived a self-sacrificing life, caring
   nothing for Myself or My own honor. I have been the vindicator of God
   and the friend of man. What have I done? Certainly nothing for which
   they could put Me to death, but everything so they should accept me as
   their Leader and their Savior."

   We hear not a word of this. The exculpation would have been complete,
   but it was not spoken. He might have baffled His enemies as He had,
   before, vanquished those who came to take Him, so that they went back
   to their masters, saying, "Never man spoke like this Man." He might
   have cleared Himself before the Roman procurator and by coming forth in
   triumph, He might have escaped from their teeth. But because He would
   stand in our place, therefore when men imag-

   ined mischievous things against Him, He was as a deaf Man and, as a
   dumb Man He opened not His mouth. Let us adore and bless Him for His
   gracious condescension, His matchless Grace in standing in our place!

   Yet further, our Lord willed that by being counted as a transgressor by
   Pilate, He might die the death appointed for malefactors by the Roman
   law. If the Jews had put our Lord to death for blasphemy, it would have
   been by stoning, but then, none of the prophecies concerning the
   Messiah spoke of His being dashed to the ground by stones. The death
   ordained for Him was crucifixion. John says in the 18th chapter at the
   32nd verse, "That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He
   spoke, signifying what death He should die." What was that saying? Is
   it not the saying in the 12th chapter of John's Gospel at the 32nd
   verse, "I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me.
   This He said, signifying what death He should die."

   Being lifted up from the earth on the Cross was death which could only
   come from the Romans. The Jews, as I have said before, executed men by
   stoning, therefore He must be condemned by the Romans that His own
   words may be fulfilled. He had spoken even more expressly in a passage
   recorded by Matthew, in the 20th chapter at the 17th verse, where He
   had declared how He would die. "And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took
   the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, Behold, we
   go up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief
   priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and
   shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to
   crucify Him: and the third day He shall rise again."

   In order that the Word which He had spoken might be fulfilled, our
   blessed Master refused to plead before Pilate anything in answer to the
   question, "What have You done?" He stands as a transgressor, to die a
   transgressor's death! Therefore forever blessed be His adorable name
   for His voluntary endurance of penalty for our sakes! When I think of
   that word, "malefactor," another word directly leaps to my lips. Call
   Him not malefactor, but BENEFACTOR! What a benefactor must He be who,
   in order to benefit us, allows Himself to be branded as a "malefactor!"
   Only think that He who at this moment sits in the center of adoring
   angels should have been called, "malefactor!" That He from whose
   inexhaustible store of goodness all the saints in Heaven and on earth
   are fed, should yet be called, "malefactor!" That He who never thought
   of harm to men, but whose very soul is love, whose every word and
   thought has been kindness towards this fallen race, should yet be
   called, "malefactor!"

   O Earth, how could you bear so grave a lie against the infinite
   goodness of the Son of God! And yet, forever blessed be His name, He
   does not hurl back the charge, for that would have been to ruin us. He
   meekly bears the scandal for our sakes. Should not this sweeten every
   title of reproach that can ever fall upon us? What if they call us evil
   names! They called the Master of the home, "malefactor," can they call
   us anything worse? Shall we look for honor where our Captain found
   nothing but shame? Therefore let it be our glory to bear shame and
   reproach for Jesus' sake. So much for the first accusation.

   II. Secondly, when the priests and scribes found that merely calling
   Him a malefactor was not sufficient, these wretched men changed their
   tactics and, according to Luke, they charged Him with setting up to be
   A KING. They said that He worked sedition, that He forbade to pay
   tribute unto Caesar and made Himself out to be a king. These were three
   great lies, for Jesus had preached peace, not sedition. His example was
   submission, not rebellion. His spirit was that of a servant, not that
   of a turbulent party leader. He had never said that men were not to pay
   tribute to Caesar--on the contrary, He had said, "Render unto Caesar
   the things that are Caesar's," and submitted Himself to every ordinance
   of authority. He had never, in their sense, set Himself up to be a
   king.

   If He had done so, many who were now His accusers might have been His
   partisans. The charge against Jesus of setting up to be a king in the
   sense in which they desired Pilate to understand them was utterly
   false, for when the multitude had been fed, they would have taken Him
   and made Him a king, but He hid Himself. No, so far from wishing to be
   a king, when one said to Him, "Master, speak to my brother that he
   divide the inheritance with me," He said, "Who made Me a judge or a
   divider over you?" He put aside any approach to interfere with the
   reigning powers. His accusers must have known that if He had willed, He
   had power at His back to have supported His claims, even as He said to
   Pilate, that, if He had been a king of a worldly dominion, His servants
   would have fought for Him. His followers had been brave and courageous,
   and enthusiastic and they would, no doubt, have given no end of trouble
   both to the Jews and to the Romans if their Leader had claimed a
   temporal sovereignty.

   But our Lord had made Peter put up his sword into its sheath and healed
   the wound which he had given. All His life He had preached peace and
   love and a kingdom which is righteousness and peace. He was no rival to
   Caesar and they knew it. And please notice that this charge of Christ
   being a king did not come from the governing power. When Pilate asked
   our Lord, "Are you the King of the Jews?" our Savior wisely replied,
   "Do you ask this of yourself, or did another tell you it of Me? Have
   you any reason to think that I am a leader of sedition? As the governor
   of this nation, you have to watch carefully, for the people are
   seditious. Have you ever seen or heard anything of Me that looks like
   an attack on your authority? Have you anything of your own knowledge
   that would lead you to bring a charge against Me?"

   Pilate, knowing nothing whatever against Him and, indeed, scorning the
   idea that he knew anything about the Jewish people, whom he detested,
   replied haughtily, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and Your own rulers
   have brought this charge against You, not I." A great point was gained
   when Pilate said this--the charge was shown to be a mere invention,
   since the eagle eye of the Roman procurator had never seen the
   slightest grounds for it. It was a frivolous charge on the very face of
   it. How could that harmless, forsaken Man be a peril to Caesar? What
   had the Roman legions to fear from that solitary Sufferer? He was too
   meek and pure to threaten warfare and strife in the domain of Tiberius!
   Look at Him and realize the absurdity of the situation!

   Moreover, it would seem a strange thing that the Jewish people should
   bring before the Roman governor their own king. Is this the way that
   subjects treat their monarchs? If He is a leader of sedition, He does
   not seem to have succeeded with His own countrymen, for the heads of
   the people are seeking His death! There could be upon the face of it no
   chance of danger whatever from rebellion which was so summarily put
   down by the Jews, themselves. If they had not been besotted by their
   rage, they would, themselves, have shrunk from so absurd a position.

   But yet I want you to note very carefully that the Lord never denied
   this charge in the sense in which He chose to understand it. He first
   explained what He meant by His being a King. And when He had explained
   it, then He openly confessed that it was even so. First, I say, He
   explained what He meant by being a King and notice carefully that He
   did not explain it away. He said, "My Kingdom," and, also, when Pilate
   said, "Are You a king, then?" He said, "You say that I am a king." He
   was, then and there, a real King and He avowed it without reserve. We
   are constantly told that the Kingdom of Christ is a spiritual kingdom,
   and this saying is true. But I would have you take heed that you do not
   spirit away His Kingdom as if it were only a pious dream. Spiritual or
   not, the Kingdom of Christ on earth is real and powerful. It is real
   none the less, but all the more because it may fitly be called
   spiritual.

   Jesus is even now a king. He said, "I am a king." Some say that His
   Kingdom is not yet, but is reserved for the latter days, but I declare
   that He is a king today and that even now Jehovah has set Him as King
   upon the holy hill of Zion. I bless God that He has translated us,
   "Into the Kingdom of His dear Son." "You are the King of Glory, O
   Christ." When I say, "Your Kingdom come," I do not mean that it may
   begin to be set up on earth, but that it may continue to be set up in
   new places, may be extended and grow, for Jesus has, at this very
   moment, a Kingdom upon the face of the earth and they that know the
   Truth of God belong to it and recognize Him as the royal Witness by
   whom the Kingdom of Truth has been founded and maintained.

   You remember the remarkable saying which is attributed to Napoleon
   Bonaparte in his later days at St. Helena? "I have founded a kingdom by
   force and it has passed away; but Jesus founded His empire upon love
   and, therefore, it will last forever." Verily, Napoleon spoke the
   truth--Jesus, the right royal Jesus, is, today, Master of innumerable
   hearts! The world knows Him not, but yet He has a Kingdom in it which
   shall, before long, break in pieces all other kingdoms! True and loyal
   hearts are to be found among the sons of men and in them His name still
   wakes enthusiasm, so that for Him they are prepared to live and die.
   Our Lord is every inch a King! He has His Throne of Grace, has His
   scepter of truth, His officers who, like Himself, witness to the Truth
   of God, and His armies of warriors who wrestle not with flesh and blood
   and use no carnal weapons, but yet go forth conquering and to conquer!

   Our Lord has His palace where He dwells, His chariot in which He rides,
   His revenues, though they are not treasures of gold and silver, and His
   proclamations, which are Law in His Church. His reigning power affects
   the destiny of the world at this present moment far more than the
   counsels of the five great powers! By the preaching of the Truth of
   God. His servants shape the ages and set up and cast down the thrones
   of earth! There is no prince so powerful as Jesus, and no empire so
   mighty as the Kingdom of Heaven. Our Lord also said that His Kingdom
   came not from this world, for that, I take it, is the more correct
   translation of the passage, "My Kingdom is not of this world." It came
   not from this world. It

   is a substantial kingdom, but it did not spring from the same sources
   as the kingdoms of the world, neither is it supported, maintained, or
   increased by the same power as that which the kingdoms of the world
   depend upon.

   Christ's Kingdom does not depend upon the force of arms--He would have
   His followers lay these weapons all aside. Christ's Kingdom does not
   depend, as earthly kingdoms too often do, upon craft, policy and
   duplicity. It used to be said that an ambassador was a gentleman who
   was sent abroad to lie for the good of his country, and I fear it might
   still describe full many an ambassador. What is the science of
   diplomacy but the art of deceit? When statesmen are thoroughly honest
   and are guided by principle, they are generally suspected--and an
   outcry is raised that the interests of the country will be sacrificed!
   But there is no diplomacy in Christ's rule--everything like crooked
   policy is of the devil--and not of Christ. He comes to bear witness to
   the Truth of God and it is by the Truth, not by force nor by craft,
   that His Throne is established among the sons of men and, therefore, it
   is not from this world.

   To be a King is, indeed, so little wrong in the sight of Jesus that it
   is the ultimate purpose of His coming to earth. He came to save men,
   did He not? Yes, but still He says, "For this purpose was I born, and
   for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto
   the truth," which is another way of saying, "that I might be a King."
   This is His ultimatum! Christ is a Teacher that He may be a
   King--Christ is an Exemplar that He may be a King! Christ is a Savior
   that He may be a King. This is the great end and objective that He has
   in His life, His death, His Resurrection, and His Second Coming--that
   He may set up a Kingdom among the sons of men to the Glory of God! Oh
   that this great objective of His mission might be furthered in our time
   and consummated speedily in the long-promised age of gold!

   The Master tells us that the main force and power of His Kingdom lies
   in the Truth of God. He came to be a King, but where is His scepter?
   The Truth! Where is His sword? It comes out of His mouth--He bears
   witness to the Truth of God. Where are His soldiers? They are men of
   Truth. Jesus Christ leads on a band of whom He says, "And you are My
   witnesses." His Kingdom consists in witnessing to the Truth of God and
   who are they that become His subjects? Why, those that are of the
   Truth--men who, hearing the Truth--know the joyful sound and accept it
   and feel its power. Dear Hearers, let each one of us ask himself, "Do I
   belong to His Kingdom? Will I have this Man to reign over me? Do I
   desire to get rid of everything in myself that is not true? Am I
   anxious to put down around me everything that is false and wicked?

   Do I wish to uphold God's Laws, because they are Truth? Do I desire to
   spread the principles of love and kindness, because they are the Truth
   of God? Am I willing to learn and so become the disciple of the
   greatest of all Teachers and then, am I willing to bear witness to what
   I have learned and so spread the sway of the Truth of God? If so, then
   I am of His Kingdom. I know that I address many who desire in their
   hearts, today, that Christ and His Truth may triumph, and they little
   mind what becomes of themselves. Let but His Gospel spread and the
   principles of righteousness prevail! And as for us, let us live or die,
   it shall be a matter of small concern! O King, live forever and we
   shall find our life in Your life and glory in promoting Your Glory,
   world without end! Such a spirit is of the Truth of God and we may
   assure ourselves that Jesus is our King.

   Our Lord, having explained His meaning, confessed that He was a King.
   This is that to which Paul refers when he says, "The Lord Jesus, who
   before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession." He did not draw
   back and say, "I am no King." Pilate might have delivered Him, then.
   But He spoke boldly concerning His blessed, mysterious and wonderful
   Kingdom and, therefore, it was not possible that He should be set free.
   This, indeed, was His accusation written over His Cross, "This is
   Jesus, the King of the Jews." Poor Pilate, he did not understand our
   Lord, even as the men of this world understand not the kingdom of
   Christ. He said to Him, "What is truth?" and without waiting for a
   reply he went out to the Jews.

   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, let us never deny that Jesus is a King--but
   we shall deny it if we do not live according to His bidding. Oh you
   that claim to be Christ's but do not live according to Christ's Laws,
   you practically deny that He is King! I dread the men who say, "We
   believe and therefore we are saved," and then do not live in
   holiness--for these divide our Lord's offices setting up His priesthood
   and denying His kingship! Half a Christ is no Christ--a Christ who is a
   priest but never a king is not the Christ of God! Oh Brethren, live as
   those who feel that every word of Jesus is Law and that you must do
   what He bids you, as He bids you and because He bids you--and so let
   all men know that unto you Jesus is both Lord and God.

   III. I conclude by noticing THE ACQUITTAL which Pilate gave to our Lord
   Jesus. He had heard the charge of being a malefactor, to which the
   Prisoner pleaded nothing. He had heard the charge of his being a King,
   which the Prisoner had most satisfactorily explained. And now Pilate,
   coming out to the people, said, "I find in Him no fault at all."
   Pilate, you have well spoken! Your verdict is typical of the verdict of
   all who have ever examined Christ! Some have examined Him with an
   unfriendly eye, but in proportion as they have been candid in the
   observation of facts, they have been struck with His life and spirit.
   It is a very rare thing to hear, even, the infidel rail at the
   Character of Jesus! In fact, some of the foremost skeptics as to our
   Lord's teaching have been remarkably impressed with admiration of His
   life.

   No character like that of Jesus is to be seen in history, no, not even
   in romance. If anyone says the four Gospel are forgeries, let him try
   to write a fifth, which shall be like the other four. Why, you cannot
   add an incident to the life of Christ! Its details are unique--the
   fancy cannot imagine a fresh incident which could be safely joined on
   to that which is recorded. Every critic would cry out, "This is not
   genuine!" The life of Jesus is a roll of cloth of gold, the manufacture
   of which the art is utterly lost. His spotless Character stands alone
   and by itself--and all true critics are compelled to say they find no
   fault at all in Him.

   Let me add that this verdict of Pilate is the verdict of all that have
   ever associated with Christ. One disciple who was with Christ betrayed
   Him, but he spoke nothing against Him. No, the last witness of Judas
   before he hanged himself was this, "I have sinned in that I have
   betrayed innocent blood." If there had been a fault in Jesus, the
   traitor would have spied it out--his unquiet conscience would have been
   glad enough to find a sedative--but even he was compelled to say, "I
   have betrayed innocent blood." "Which of you convicts Me of sin?" is
   the challenge of Jesus, to which there is no reply! Some of us have
   lived with Christ spiritually. In the course of His Providence, He has
   brought some of us very low by sickness, or by bereavement, or loss.
   Everyone saved by our Lord has come under the discipline of His house,
   for, "whom the Lord loves, He chastens and scourges every son whom He
   receives."

   Now, what is the verdict of all here present who know Jesus, our King?
   For my part, I find no fault at all in Him. He is everything that is
   lovely. He is all my salvation and all my desire. Do you not think that
   out of the millions of Christians who have lived hoping in Christ, one
   would have told us if it is His habit to disappoint His people? Out of
   so many Believers who dwell with Him, surely some one or other of them,
   when they came to die, would have told us if He is not all that He
   professes to be! Would not some one or other have confessed, "I trusted
   in Christ and He has not delivered me! It is all a delusion"? Surely,
   out of the many we have seen depart, we would have found some one or
   two that would have let out the secret and have said, "He is a
   deceiver! He cannot save, He cannot help, He cannot deliver." But never
   one dying Believer throughout the ages has spoken evil of Him! All have
   said, "We find no fault at all in Him."

   Mark you, that will be the verdict of everyone among you. If any of you
   reject Christ, when you stand at His Judgment Seat to be condemned
   because you believe not in Him and when that withering word, "Depart,
   you cursed!" shall consign you to your everlasting portion, you shall
   then be obliged to say, "I find no fault at all in Him. There was no
   failure in His blood--the failure was in my lack of faith! There was no
   failure in His Spirit--the failure was in my obstinate will! There was
   no failure in His promise--the failure was that I would not receive
   Him! There was no fault at all in Him. He never spurned me. He never
   refused to hear my prayers. If my Sabbaths were wasted, it was no fault
   of His! If I defied the Gospel, it was no fault of His. If I have
   perished, my blood is at my own door. I find no fault at all in Him."
   From all parts of creation shall go up one general attestation to His
   perfection. Heaven and earth and Hell shall all join the common
   verdict, "We find no fault at all in Him."

   I will send you away when I give you three practical words to think of.
   The first is this--Beware of an external religion, for the men that
   called Jesus malefactor and falsely accused Him were very religious
   people and would not go into Pilate's hall for fear of polluting
   themselves! They were strong in rituals, but weak in morals. None are
   so inveterate against the principles of the Gospel as those whose
   religion consists in form and ceremony but does not affect their
   hearts! I charge you tear your hearts and not your garments! Follow
   Christ spiritually! Follow Christ in your very souls, or else
   sacraments will be your ruin and even in trying to keep yourselves from
   ceremonial defilement you will be defiling yourselves with hypocrisy.

   The next thing is to charge you, dear Friends, and to charge myself,
   also, to shun all proud worldliness like that of Pilate. Pilate treats
   the whole matter with flippancy--he is a proud and haughty Roman--he
   hates the people whom he governs and though he has a conscience, and at
   first he shows a tenderness towards his prisoner--yet his chief end and

   aim was to keep his office and amass money. And therefore innocent
   blood must be spilt. He must please the Jews, even if he murders the,
   "Just One." This selfish worldliness in which a man makes his gold and
   himself his god always treats religion with contempt. The man minds the
   main chance and sneeringly cries, "What is truth?" He knows what money
   is and what power is, but what is truth? It is a dream, a folly to him
   and he despises it.

   There are persons around us now, clever time-serving men, with grand
   notions of their own abilities--and to them Jesus and His Gospel are
   matters for old women, servant girls and what they call a Puritan crew.
   Such topics are not for gentlemen of thought, culture and
   understanding, like their high and mighty selves. "What is truth?" they
   say. They are rather favorably inclined to religion, that is to say,
   they do not persecute, but they despise--which in some respects is
   worse. They say, "We are agnostics! We have no particular views. We are
   large-hearted and let every man think as he chooses, but still there is
   nothing in it--it is all matter of opinion. One man says this is the
   truth and another says that is the truth--and how are we to know? The
   fact is, there is no such thing as fixed truth at all--

   'For differing creeds let graceless zealots fight.

   He can't be wrong whose life is in the right.'" This is this great
   man's conclusion of the matter and yet it so happens that this
   gentleman's life is not in the right at all and, therefore, on his own
   showing he has not much joy of his pretty rhyme. I think I see him as
   he turns on his heels with, "What is truth?"

   Let him be a warning to you! Come not near to such arrogant trifling.
   Be always foolish enough to be willing to judge candidly. Be so little
   clever as to be still willing to learn. Be so little certain of your
   own infallibility that you will at least hear reason and will enquire
   whether these things are so. Alas, I fear that through worldly pride
   many will have it said of them, as it is said of the Roman governor
   every day in the creed--"Suffered under Pontius Pilate." Oh, how many
   times has Christ suffered under just such people as Pontius Pilate?

   Last of all, let us all submit ourselves to Jesus our King. Wayworn and
   weary, emaciated and broken down, with His face more marred than that
   of any man, yet let us bow before Him and say, "All hail You, King of
   the Jews! You are our King forever and ever!" If we are willing to
   acknowledge Him as our King in His shame and derision, He will,
   by-and-by, honor us when He comes in the Glory of the Father and all
   His holy angels with Him. Then shall He cause it to be seen that He has
   made us, who follow Him, to be kings and priests unto God and we shall
   reign with Him forever and ever! Amen.

Our Lord before Herod

   (No. 1645)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 19, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad: for he was desirous
   to see Him for a long season, because he had heard many things of Him;
   and he hoped to ha ve seen some miracle done by Him. Then he questioned
   Him in many words; but He answered him nothing." Luke 23:8.9.

   AFTER Pilate had declared to the chief priests and scribes that he
   found no fault at all in Jesus, they were afraid that their victim
   would escape and, therefore, their fury was raised to the highest pitch
   and they cried out the more vehemently against Him. In the course of
   their outcries they made use of the word, "Galilee," going, as it seems
   to me, a little out of their way in order to drag in the name--"He
   stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from
   Galilee to this place." Galilee was a region held in very great
   contempt and they mentioned it to cast a slur upon our Lord, as if He
   were a mere boor from among the clowns of Galilee. To Pilate, they
   thought that the mention of the name would, perhaps, act like the
   proverbial red rag held before an infuriated bull, for he appears to
   have been troubled by seditious persons from that province.

   We all remember that they were Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled
   with their sacrifices. The Galileans were reputed to be an ignorant
   people, apt to be led astray by impostors and so enthusiastic that they
   ventured their lives against the Romans. The priests would not only
   cast contempt upon Jesus, whom they were known to call the Galilean,
   but also excite the prejudices of Pilate, so that he might condemn Him
   to die as one of a nest of rebels. They were mistaken, however, in the
   consequences of their device, for Pilate caught at the word, "Galilee,"
   directly. That province was not immediately under his rule--it was
   under the sway of the tetrarch Herod Antipas and, therefore, he thought
   within himself, "I can kill two birds with one stone--I can get rid of
   this troublesome business by sending this prisoner to Herod--and I can
   also greatly gratify the king by showing him this attention."

   Pilate had quarreled with Herod and now, for some purpose of his own,
   he resolved to patch up a friendship by pretending great deference to
   his sovereign powers by sending one of his subjects to be tried by him.
   Pilate, therefore, asked, "Is this man a Galilean?" and when they told
   him that He was--for He was so by repute, His birth at Bethlehem having
   been willfully ignored--then Pilate at once commanded that He be led to
   Herod, for Herod was in his palace at Jerusalem attending the Passover
   festival.

   See, then, my Brothers and Sisters, our Divine Master conducted in His
   third march of sorrow through Jerusalem! First, He was led from the
   garden to the house of Annas; then He was conducted through the streets
   from the hall of Caiaphas to the judgment hall of Pilate. And now, by
   Pilate's orders, He is led a third time by the angry crowd of priests
   through the streets to the palace of Herod, there to await His fourth
   examination! Certain of the old writers delight to remark that as there
   were four evangelists to do honor to our Lord, so were there four
   judges to do Him shame. Annas and Caiaphas, Pilate and Herod. We are on
   safer ground when we observe with the early Church the coalition of the
   heathen and the Jews--"For of a truth against Your holy Child Jesus,
   whom You have anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
   Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do
   whatever Your hand and Your counsel determined before to be done."

   This morning I shall endeavor to set forth this portion of the sad
   narrative under two heads, which will be these-- Herod before
   Jesus--and Jesus before Herod.

   I. I call your attention, first, to HEROD BEFORE JESUS because you must
   know something of his character, something of the meaning of his
   questions, before you can rightly understand the sorrow which they
   caused Jesus, our Lord and Master. This Herod Antipas was the son of
   the old Herod the Great who had put to death the babes at Bethlehem in
   the hope of destroying the King of the Jews. He was a chip off the old
   block, but still, he was several degrees baser than

   his father. There was nothing of the grandeur of his father about him.
   There was the same evil disposition without the courage and the
   decision. He did not, in some things, out-Herod Herod, for in certain
   points he was a more despicable person. Herod the Great may be called a
   lion, but our Lord very descriptively called this lesser Herod a fox,
   saying, "Go and tell this fox."

   He was a man of dissolute habits and frivolous mind. He was very much
   under the sway of a wicked woman who destroyed any little good there
   might have been in him. He was a lover of pleasure, a lover of himself,
   depraved, weak and trifling to the last degree. I almost grudge to call
   him a man, therefore let him only be called a tetrarch. This petty
   tet-rarch had once been the subject of religious impressions. These
   Herods all, more or less, felt the influence of religion at times,
   though they were by no means benefited thereby. The impressions made
   upon his conscience by John did not last with Herod. They were, at
   first, powerful and practical, for we are informed that, "Herod feared
   John, knowing that he was a just man and holy, and observed him; and
   when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."

   I suppose he reformed many matters in his kingdom and cast off,
   perhaps, some of his grosser vices. But when, at last John began to
   denounce him for having taken his brother's wife to be his paramour,
   while yet the brother lived, he cast his reprover into prison. And then
   you remember how, with reluctance, Herod, to please his mistress,
   beheaded John in prison. Mark this--probably there is no more dangerous
   character living than a man who has once come under religious
   influences so as to be materially affected by them--and yet has broken
   loose and cast off all fear of God! He has done despite to his
   conscience so violently that from now on he will know few qualms.

   In such a man is fulfilled the saying of our Lord, "When the unclean
   spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest
   and finds none. Then he says, I will return into my house from where I
   came out; and when he is come, he finds it empty, swept and garnished.
   Then goes he, and takes with himself seven other spirits, more wicked
   than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of
   that man is worse than the first." The mind of Herod An-tipas was in
   the condition of the chamber which has been swept and garnished, for
   his life had been somewhat reformed, but the unclean spirit with the
   terrible seven had come back to his old den and now he was a worse man
   by a great deal than he had ever been before. The dog returned to his
   vomit and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

   This Herod was an Idumaean, that is to say, one of the descendants of
   Esau, an Edomite, and though he had professedly become a Jew, yet the
   old blood was in him, as it is written concerning Edom, "He did pursue
   his brother with the sword and cast off all pity." The true Jacob stood
   before one of the seed of Esau, a tetrarch, profane and worldly like
   his ancestor--and scant was the pity which He received. Esau was
   descended from Abraham according to the flesh, but with Jacob was the
   Covenant according to the spirit--it bodes no good to the spiritual
   seed when it comes, even for a moment, under the power of the carnal
   seed!

   We see how the child of the flesh takes to mocking, while the child
   according to promise is called to patience. Herod was in such a state
   of mind that he furnishes me with a typical character which I would use
   for the instruction and admonition of you all. He is a type of some who
   frequently come to this Tabernacle and go to other places of worship,
   occa-sionally--people who were once under religious impressions and
   cannot forget that they were so--but who will never be under any
   religious impressions again. They are now hardened into vain curiosity!
   They wish to know about everything that is going on in the Church and
   Kingdom of Christ, but they are far enough from caring to become part
   and parcel of it, themselves. They are possessed with an idle curiosity
   which would lift the golden lid of the Ark and intrude behind the veil.

   They like to gather together all the absurd stories which are told
   about ministers and to retail all the odd remarks that were ever made
   by preachers for centuries. All the gossip of the Churches is sure to
   be known to them, for they eat up the sins of God's people as they eat
   bread! It is not likely that their knowledge of religious things will
   be of any use to them, but they are always eager after it. The Church
   of God is their lounge; Divine service is their theater; ministers are
   to them, as actors, and the Gospel, itself, so much play-house
   property. They are a sort of religious Athenians, spending their time
   in nothing else than in hearing some new thing, hoping that, perhaps,
   some singular and unexpected discourse may be delivered in their
   hearing which they can retail in the next company where they would
   raise a laugh. To them, preaching is all a farce and, worked up with a
   few falsehoods of their own, it makes excellent fun for them and causes
   them to be regarded as amusing fellows. Let them look at Herod and see
   in him their leader, the type of what they really are or may soon
   become!

   First, let us see idle curiosity at its best. Look here, Sirs, and then
   look in a glass and trace the likeness! To begin with, we find that
   Herod's curiosity had been created in him by his having heard many
   things concerning Jesus. How did he come to hear of Him? His great
   deeds were common talk--all Jerusalem rang with the news of His
   miracles and wondrous words. Herod, a convert to the Jewish faith, such
   as he was, took interest in anything that was going on among the Jews
   and all the more so if it touched upon the kingdom, for the jealousy
   which set his father in a rage was not altogether absent in his son. No
   doubt, also, he had heard of Christ from John. John would not long have
   preached to Herod without using his own grand text, "Behold the Lamb of
   God, which takes away the sin of the world."

   I am sure that, though he was a preacher of righteousness, he had not
   left off being the herald of the coming Savior! And so, from the stern
   lips of the great Baptist, Herod had heard concerning the King of the
   Jews and something concerning His Kingdom. When John was dead, Herod
   heard still more of Christ, so that, astonished with what was being
   done, he said, "This is John the Baptist whom I have beheaded: he is
   risen from the dead!" Jesus became a kind of nightmare to his
   conscience. He was disturbed and alarmed by what he heard that the
   Prophet of Nazareth was doing. Besides that, there was one in his
   household who doubtless knew a great deal about the Savior, for in
   Herod's court was the husband of a woman who ministered unto the Lord
   of her substance.

   The lady's name was Joanna and her husband was Chuza, Herod's
   steward--I suppose Herod's butler and manager of his household. From
   Chuza he could readily have learned concerning Jesus and we may be sure
   that he would enquire, for the fear of the great Prophet was upon him.
   Thus Herod's curiosity had been excited about our Lord Jesus Christ for
   a considerable time and he longed to see Him. I am not sorry when this
   happens to any of my Hearers. I am right glad that they should hear
   something about the Lord from His friends, something about Him from His
   ministers and from those of us whose highest glory it is that, though
   we are not worthy to unloose the laces of His shoes, yet it is all our
   business here below to cry, "Behold the Lamb!" So these rumors, this
   talk, these admonitions had begotten in Herod's mind the desire that
   his eyes should light on Jesus--so far, so good.

   Often men at this day come up to the House of Prayer that they may hear
   the preacher--not because they want to be converted, not because they
   have any idea of ever becoming followers of Jesus--but because they
   have heard something about true religion which excites their curiosity
   and they want to know what it is all about. They are fond of
   curiosities of literature and so they would study curiosities of
   religion, oddities of oratory and things remarkable of a theological
   kind. It is said of Herod, in consequence of this curiosity, that he
   rejoiced to see Jesus. It is said that he was, "exceedingly glad." What
   a hopeful state to be in! May we not expect great things when a man
   sees Jesus and is exceedingly glad? As I read this passage to myself, I
   thought, Why, the language might well describe a child of God! Our text
   might fitly be spoken concerning ourselves!

   Let me read it line by line and remark upon it. "When Herod saw Jesus,
   he was exceedingly glad." So were the Apostles when Jesus manifested
   Himself to them, for it is written, "Then were the disciples glad when
   they saw the Lord." What other sight could bring to a true Believer
   such joy? "For he was desirous to see Him." Are we not? Are not all His
   people longing for that blessed vision which will make their Heaven
   throughout eternity? "For he was desirous to see Him for a long
   season." This is also true of us--our hearts are weary with watching
   and our eyes fail for the sight of His face. "Why does He tarry?" we
   cry. "Make haste, my Beloved, and be You like a roe or a young hart
   upon the mountains of spices." "Because he had heard many things of
   Him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by Him."

   This, also, is our hope--we would both see and feel some gracious
   miracle--upon our eyes, that they may be opened, or upon our hands,
   that we may have greater power in the Master's work! Or upon our feet,
   that we may run in the ways of obedience. And especially upon our
   hearts, that we may be always soft and tender, pure and gracious, to
   feel the mind of God. Yes, these words read very prettily, indeed! But
   yet, you see, the meaning was not the high and spiritual one which we
   could put into them, but the low and groveling one which was all that
   Herod could reach. He was "exceedingly glad," but it was a frivolous
   gladness because he hoped that now his curiosity would be satisfied.

   He had Jesus in his power and he hoped, now, to hear some of the
   oratory of the Prophet of whom men said, "Never man spoke like this
   Man." He hoped to see Him work a miracle, even He, of whom the record
   was, "He has done all things well." Could not the great Prophet be
   induced to multiply loaves and fishes? Might he not persuade Him to
   heal a blind beggar, or make a lame man leap as a hart? Would not a
   miracle make rare mirth in Herod's palace and cause a new sensation in
   the mind of the worn-out debauchee? If, for instance, a corpse were dug
   up and Jesus would restore it to life,

   it would be something to tell when next the king sat down to a drinking
   bout with Herodias and her like! When each was trying to exceed the
   other in telling strange tales, Herod would top them all!

   In this style many people come to hear the Gospel. They want to have an
   anecdote of their own about a notorious preacher--and if they do see
   something ludicrous, or hear something striking, they will invent a
   tale and swear that they heard it and saw it, though the lie might well
   choke them! They act thus because they come to hear for nothing but to
   feed their hungry curiosity! None carry this to such an extreme as
   those who did at one time feel a measure of the power of the Word of
   God but have shaken it off. These are the mockers whose bands are made
   strong. These are the idlers who turn even the testimony of the Lord
   into food for mirth! Still, at the first blush, there is something that
   looks very hopeful about them and we are pleased that they exhibit such
   gladness when Christ is set forth before them.

   One evil sign about Herod was the fact that his conscience had gone to
   sleep after having, for a while, troubled him. For a little while he
   had been afraid of Jesus and trembled lest John had risen from the
   dead. But that fear had subsided and superstition had given way before
   his Sadducean skepticism. He hoped that Jesus would perform some
   wonderful thing in his presence, but he had lost all dread of the Just
   and Holy One. He was a man of vain mind--the man whom he feared one
   day--he murdered the next! And He whom he welcomed with gladness, he
   hurried off with derision. There was left to Herod no feeling towards
   Jesus but the craving after something new, the desire to be astonished,
   the wish to be amused.

   I think I see him now, sitting on his throne, expectant of wonders,
   like the trifler that he was. "Now we shall see," he says, "now we
   shall see what we shall see! Perhaps He will deliver Himself by sheer
   force! If He walked the sea, He will probably fly away in the air!
   Perhaps He will render Himself invisible and so pass away through the
   midst of the chief priests. I have heard that many a time when they
   would have stoned Him or cast Him down from the brow of a hill, He
   departed, gliding through their midst--perhaps He will do the same this
   morning." There sits the cunning prince, thinking what the wonder will
   be--regarding even displays of Divine power as mere showman's tricks,
   or magician's illusions!

   When Jesus was set before Him, he began to ask Him questions. "Then he
   questioned Him in many words." I am glad the questions are not
   recorded. They could have done us no good and, besides, our modern
   Herods, nowadays, are great masters of the art and need not that any
   man teach them. We need not to be furnished with the old-fashioned
   quibbles and questions, for the supply is quite equal to our
   requirements. Fools can ask more questions in 10 minutes than wise men
   are able to answer in 50 years! I say we do not need the old questions,
   but I daresay they would run somewhat in this line, "Are You that King
   of the Jews whom my father strove to slay? How came You are a Nazarene?
   Have You been a miracle worker, or is it all slight of hand and black
   magic? John told me something about You. Did You deceive him, or is it
   true? Have you raised the dead? Can you heal the sick?"

   Trying all the while to excite Him to work a miracle, he raised doubts
   and chopped logic volubly, for the text suggestively mentions his,
   "many words." The curious in religion are generally very apt at asking
   questions, not that they want Christ; not that they want Heaven; not
   that they want pardon of sin--not that they want any good thing--but
   still they would like to know everything that is dark and mysterious in
   theology. They would like to have a list of the difficulties of belief,
   a catalog of the curiosities of spiritual experience. Some men collect
   ferns, others are learned upon beetles, but these persons pry into
   Church life, its doctrines, pursuits, aims and infirmities--especially
   the latter! They could write a book upon orthodox England and
   unorthodox England and dwell with unction upon mental vagaries.

   It furnishes them with something new and adds to their store of
   information--and so they spare no prying questions, for they would
   analyze manna from Heaven, and distil the tears of Christ--nothing is
   sacred to them! They put Scripture on the rack and laugh at the words
   of the Holy Spirit!

   Thus have I set forth idle curiosity in its latter stage. Now let us
   pass on an see how Jesus treated this curiosity, considering it under
   the head of IDLE CURIOSITY DISAPPOINTED. "He questioned Him in many
   words, but He answered him nothing!" If Herod had wanted to believe,
   Jesus would have been ready enough to instruct. If Herod had possessed
   a broken heart, Jesus would have hastened with tender words to bind it
   up. If Herod bad been a candid enquirer; if his doubts had been sincere
   and true, the faithful and true Witness, the Prince of the kings of the
   earth, would have been delighted to speak with him!

   But Jesus knew that Herod would not believe in Him and would not take
   up his cross and follow Him and, therefore, He would not waste words on
   a heartless, soulless profligate. Had He not said to His own disciples,
   "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast you your
   pearls before swine"? He saw in this man one so mean, cunning, cowardly
   and heartless that He viewed him as a fox to be let alone rather than a
   lost sheep to be sought after! He was a tree twice dead and plucked up
   by the roots. All the Master did was to maintain an absolute silence in
   his presence, "and let him question as he might, He answered him
   nothing."

   Observe, my Brothers and Sisters, that our Lord Jesus Christ came not
   into this world to be a performer! He did not leave His Glory to earn
   the wondering approbation of men. And as Herod regarded Him as a mere
   wonderworker and would have turned his court into a theater where Jesus
   would be the chief actor, our Lord very wisely held His peace and did
   nothing at all. And sometimes His ministers might be wise if they were
   silent, too. If they know that men have no desire to learn, no
   spiritual wish or aspiration, I say they might be wise if they held
   their tongue altogether. I have sometimes admired George Fox, who, on
   one occasion, when the crowd had gathered round him, expecting him to
   deliver some fiery address, stood still by the space of two hours while
   they clamored that he should speak.

   Never a word did they get from him. He said he would famish them of
   words for words were all they wanted and not the power of the Spirit.
   Probably they remembered his silence better than they would have
   remembered his most vehement discourse. Sometimes silence is all that
   men deserve and the only thing which, in any probability, will impress
   them. As the Lord Jesus was no performer, He did not gratify Herod, but
   answered him not a word. Moreover, be it remembered that Herod had
   already silenced the Voice and no marvel that he could not hear the
   Word. For what was John? He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the
   wilderness." What was Jesus but the Word? He that silences the Voice
   may well be denied the Word!

   Had not his shallow soul been moved--I was about to say, to its depths,
   such depths as they were--had he not been admonished by one of the
   greatest of the children of men? For among them that were born of women
   there had not, then, been a greater than John the Baptist! Had not a
   burning and shining light shone right into his very eyes? And if he
   refused to hear the greatest of the sons of men and to see the
   brightest light that God had then kindled, it was but right that the
   Savior should refuse him even a ray of light and let him perish in the
   darkness which he had, himself, created. Ah, Sirs, you cannot trifle
   with religious impressions with impunity! God thinks it no trifle! He
   who has once been moved in his soul and has put away the heavenly Word
   of God may fear that it will be said of him, "My Spirit shall not
   always strive with man. Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone."

   May not some conscience here, if it has but a little life in it, be
   alarmed at the memory of former rejections of the Gospel, frequent
   quenching of the Spirit, repeated trampling upon the blood of Jesus? If
   God never speaks to you again in the way of mercy, you have no right to
   expect that He should do so! And if, from this day to the Day of
   Judgment, the Lord should never give you another word of mercy, who
   shall say that you have been treated harshly? Have you not deserved it
   at His hands as Herod had done?

   Furthermore, remember that Herod might have heard Christ hundreds of
   times before if he had chosen to do so. Jesus was always to be found by
   those who desired to listen to Him. He did not go sneaking about
   Galilee, or holding secret conventicles in holes and corners. He always
   spoke in the synagogue and Herod might have gone there. He spoke in the
   street or by the seashore, or on the mountain side and Herod might have
   gone there, too. Jesus stood out boldly before the people and His
   teaching was public and free--if Herod had wished to hear Him, he might
   have done so times beyond number! Therefore now, having despised all
   these opportunities, the Savior will not furnish Him with another which
   he would have treated in the same manner. He answers him nothing and by
   so doing answered him terribly.

   Beware how you use opportunities. Dear Hearers, beware how you use your
   Sabbaths. There may come a day when you would give a thousand worlds
   for another Sabbath, but it shall be denied you. There may come a day
   when you would count out all your wealth to have another invitation to
   Christ, but it will be denied you, for you must die and the voice of
   Mercy will never ring in your ears again! They that will not when they
   may, shall not when they could! Many will knock after the Master of the
   house has risen up and shut the door. But when He shuts, no man opens.
   The door was shut on Herod.

   Observe that our Master had good reason for refusing to speak to Herod
   this time, over and above what I have men-tioned--because He would not
   have it supposed that He yielded to the pomp and dignity of men! Jesus
   never refused an

   answer to the question of a beggar, but He would not gratify the
   curiosity of a king. Herod dreams that he has a right to ask whatever
   impertinent questions he may choose to invent, but Jesus knows nothing
   of men's rights in such a matter-- it is all Grace with Him--and to Him
   the prince upon the throne is not an atom better than the peasant in
   the cottage! And so when Herod, in all his pride and glory thinks full
   sure that Christ will pay deference to him and, perhaps, will pay him
   court to win his favor, Jesus disregards him!

   He wants nothing of the murderer of John the Baptist! Had Herod been
   the poorest and most loathsome leper throughout all Judea. Had he been
   the meanest beggar in the street who was lame or blind, his voice would
   at once been heard by the Lord of Mercy! But He will not answer the
   prince who hopes for homage at His hands, nor feed the idle wishes of a
   crafty reprobate! What favor did He need at Herod's hand? He had not
   come to be set free--He had come to die and, therefore, His face is set
   like a flint, and, with heroic courage, He answers him not a word. Now,
   then, you have seen frivolous curiosity at its best and you have seen
   it disappointed, as it generally is to this day. If people come to hear
   the Gospel out of this frivolous curiosity, they usually retire saying,
   "Really, I do not see anything in it. We have heard nothing eloquent,
   nothing profound, nothing outrageous."

   Just so. There is nothing in the Gospel to please the luxurious, though
   everything to bless the poor! Jesus answered Herod nothing and He will
   answer you nothing if you are of Herod's order. It is the doom of
   triflers that they should get no answer from the Gospel! Neither the
   Scriptures, nor the ministry, nor the Spirit of God, nor the Lord Jesus
   will speak with them. What was the result of this disappointment upon
   Herod? Idle curiosity curdles into derision. He thinks Jesus is a fool,
   if not an idiot, and he says so and begins to deride Him. With his men
   of war he mocks Him and "set Him at naught," which signifies to make
   nothing of Him. He calls his soldiers and says, "Look at this
   creature--He will not answer a word to what I have to say--is He bereft
   of His senses? Wake Him up and see."

   Then they mock and laugh and jest and jeer. "Here," says Herod, "He
   calls Himself a King! Bring out one of my shining white robes and put
   it on Him! We will make a King of Him." So they put it about His
   blessed Person and again heap insults upon Him. Was it not
   strange--this decking Him in a gorgeous robe of dazzling white? The
   mediaeval writers delight to dwell on the fact that Herod arrayed our
   Lord in white and afterwards Pilate clothed Him in red. Is He not the
   Lily of the valley and the Rose of Sharon? Is He not matchlessly white
   for innocence and then gloriously red in His atoning blood? Thus, in
   their very mockery, they are unconsciously setting forth to us both His
   spotless holiness and His majestic royalty!

   When they had insulted to their full, they sent Him back to Pilate,
   kicking Him from foot to foot at their pleasure, as if He were a
   football for their sport. Then our Lord made His fourth sorrowful march
   through the streets of the city over which He had wept. That is what
   idlers in the long run do with Christ--in their disappointment they
   grow weary of Him and His Gospel and they cry, "Put Him away; there is
   nothing in Him, nothing of what we looked for, nothing to satisfy
   curiosity, nothing sensational; take Him away!" Away goes Jesus, never
   to return, and that is the end of Herod and the end of a great many
   more.

   II. My time is nearly gone, but bear with me while, for a few minutes,
   I try to set forth JESUS IN THE PRESENCE OF HEROD. Although no blows
   are recorded, I greatly question whether our Divine Master suffered
   anywhere more than He did in the palace of Herod. You and I, perhaps,
   apprehend most easily the woe of the coarser sufferings when they
   scourged Him and when they plaited the crown of thorns and put it upon
   His head. But the delicate and sensitive mind of our Master was,
   perhaps, more touched by what He suffered in the palace of Herod than
   by the rougher torture. For, first, here is a Man fully in earnest for
   the salvation of our souls--and in the midst of His grievous passion He
   is looked upon as a mountebank and a mere performer who is expected to
   work a miracle for the amusement of an impious court.

   How it cuts an earnest man to the quick when he finds that, let him do
   what he may, people do not sympathize with him in earnest, but are
   coolly criticizing his style, or imitating his mannerisms, or admiring
   his expressions as matters of literary taste. It is heart-breaking,
   when your ardor makes you self-forgetful, to find others pecking at
   trifles, or making your efforts into a kind of show. The Christ must
   have been wounded in His very soul when He was treated as a mere
   per-former--as if He had left the Father's bosom and was about to give
   Himself to death and yet was aiming to amuse or to astonish! I know how
   it saddens my Lord's servants when they preach their very hearts out,
   to bring men to repentance, and the only result is to elicit the remark
   that, "His arguments were very telling and that pathetic passage was
   very fine."

   There is a thorn in such chill words to pierce deeper than the crown of
   thorns! Horrible indifference smites like the Roman scourge.

   Then to think of our Lord's being questioned by such a fop as Herod! A
   Man of earnest and intense soul, living for one thing only, and that
   the redemption of mankind--is here worried by the foolish questions of
   a man of the world! Were you ever in an agony of bodily pain, yourself,
   and did some frivolous person call upon you and begin to torture you
   with the most wicked nonsense and absurdities? Have you not felt that
   his chatter was worse than the pain? It must have been so with Jesus.
   When the ridiculous must question the sublime, the result is misery!
   With the bloody sweat yet damp upon His brow and with the accursed spit
   still defacing His blessed Countenance, the Man of Sorrows must be
   tortured by the driveling of a heartless idler! With His heart all
   bowed down under a sense of the awful penalty of sin, the great
   Substitute for sinners must be molested by the petty small talk and
   ribald jests of the meanest of mankind!

   Solving eternal problems and building up an Everlasting Temple unto the
   living God, He must be twitted by a vainglorious tetrarch; tormented
   and tortured by foolish questions fit only to be asked of an impostor.
   We think the Cross, itself, was not a worse instrument of torture than
   the haughty tongue of this debauched monarch! Then the ribaldry of the
   whole thing must have tortured our Lord. The whole of them gathered
   round about Him with their hoarse laughter and coarse jests. He has
   become a byword and a proverb to them. When you are merry, you can
   enjoy merriment, but when the heart is sad, laughter is wretchedly
   discordant and embitters your grief. Now this one laughs and then
   another sneers--while a third thrusts out the tongue and they are all
   uproariously jovial! In harmony they are all making nothing of Him,
   though with awful earnestness He is lifting the world out of the slough
   of despair and hanging it in its place, again, among the stars of
   Glory!

   Jesus was performing more than Herculean labors and these little
   beings, like so many gnats and flies, were stinging Him! Small things
   are great at torturing and these worthless beings did their utmost to
   torment our Lord. Oh, the torture of the Master's spirit! Remember, it
   was no small sorrow to our Lord to be silent. You tell me that He
   appears majestic in His silence? It is so, but the pain of it was
   acute. Can you speak well? Do you love to speak for the good of your
   fellow men and do you know that when you speak, full often your words
   are spirit and life to those who hear you? It will be very hard to feel
   compelled to refuse them a good word. Do not imagine that the Lord
   despised Herod as Herod despised the Lord. Ah, no! The pity of His soul
   went out to this poor frivolous creature who must make sport of the
   Savior's sufferings and treat the Son of the Highest as though He were
   a court fool who must play before him.

   The Savior's infinite love was breaking His heart, for He longed to
   bless His persecutor and yet He must not speak, nor give forth a
   warning word. True, there was little need for words, for His very
   Presence was a sermon which ought to have melted a heart of stone--but
   yet it cost the Savior a mighty effort to keep down the floodgates and
   hold in the blessed torrents of His holy speech which would have flowed
   out in compassionate pleading. Silent He must be, but the anguish of
   it, I can scarcely tell. Sometimes to be permitted to speak a word is
   the greatest comfort you can have. Have you ever been in such a state
   that if you could cry out it would have been a relief to you? What
   anguish, then, to be forced to be as a dumb man! What woe to be forced
   to be silent with all these mockers about Him and yet to be pitying
   them all!

   As a man might pity a moth that flies into the flame of the candle and
   will not be delivered, so did our Lord pity these creatures. How sad
   that they could make sport of their own damnation, fling the salvation
   of God to the ground and tread it down as swine tread down their husks!
   Oh, it grieved the Master's heart! It moved His soul to its very
   center. Think of the utter contempt that was poured upon Him. I do not
   judge that this was the bitterest of His woes, for their contempt was
   an honor to Him. But it was one ingredient of His cup of mingled
   wormwood and gall that they should so despise Him as to clothe Him in a
   white robe and mock His kingship--when on that kingship their only hope
   was hung! They "set Him at naught," that is, put Him down as nothing,
   jeered and jested at Him--and if there was nothing, even, about His
   Manhood which they could respect--they invented ways by which they
   could pour scorn upon Him.

   Luke is the Gospel of the Man--if you want to read about Jesus in His
   Manhood, read Luke--and there you will see how His very Manhood was
   trampled in the mire by these inhuman creatures who found their joy in
   despising Him! See, then, your Lord and Master, and let me put two or
   three questions to you. Do you not think that this peculiar silence of
   Jesus was a part of His anguish in which He was bearing the punishment
   for your sins of the tongue? Ah me, ah me! Redeemed of the Lord, how
   often have you misused your speech by wanton words! How often have we
   uttered murmuring

   words, proud words, false words, words of despite to holy things--and
   now our sins of the tongue are all coming upon Jesus and He must stand
   silent and bear our penalty!

   And is it not possible that when they put the gorgeous robe upon Him,
   He was bearing your sins of vanity, your sins of dress and pride when
   you made yourselves glorious to behold and arrayed yourselves in
   gorgeous robes and glittering apparel? Know you not that these things
   are your shame? For had you had no sin, you would have needed none of
   these poor rags--and may not the Christ in white and red be bearing
   your sins of folly? And do you not think that when they were making Him
   nothing and despising Him, He was, then, bearing our sins when we set
   Him at naught with our words of despite and derision--and when,
   perhaps, in our ungodly days we, too, made sport of holy things and
   jested at the Word of God? Ah me, I think it was so and I ask you to
   look at Him and say as you see Him there, "It is not Herod after all!
   It is my tongue, my vanity, my trifling with holy things which caused
   Him this exquisite torture! Lord Jesus, Substitute for me, let all
   these transgressions of mine be put away once and for all by Your
   meritorious passion."

   Finally, we read that Herod and Pilate were made friends from that day
   on and I hope if there are any here that are true-hearted Christians,
   if they have had any ill-will towards one another, they will think it a
   great shame that Herod and Pilate should be friends and that any two
   followers of Jesus should not be friends at the sight of the suffering
   Master! As for those two foxes, Pilate and Herod, they were tied, tail
   to tail, that day by our great Samson! Our Lord has often been a point
   of union for wicked men--not by His intent and purpose--but because
   they have joined together to oppose Him. I have often smiled in my
   heart to see how superstition and skepticism will march together when
   they are anxious to oppose the Gospel. Then the Sadducee says, "Give me
   your hand, dear Pharisee. We have a common interest here, for this Man
   would overturn us all." The Gospel is the mortal enemy both of the
   skeptical Sadducee and the superstitious Phari-see--and so they lay
   aside their differences to assail it.

   Now, then, if the wicked unite before our Lord Jesus when He wears the
   white robe, should not His people much more be united, especially when
   they remember that He said, "A new commandment I give unto you, that
   you love one another." I charge you by your homage to Him you call
   Master and Lord, if you have any difference of any sort with any
   Christian Brother or Sister, let not yon sun go down till you have
   ended it by hearty love for Jesus' sake! Let it be seen that Christ is
   the great Uniter of all those who are in Him. He would have us love one
   another even as He has loved us! And His prayer is that we may be one.
   May the Lord hear that prayer and make us one in Christ Jesus. Amen.

A Home Question and a Right Answer

   (No. 1646)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 5, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "From that time many of His disciples went back and walkedno more with
   Him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will you, also, go away? Then
   Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words
   of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that You are the Christ,
   the Son of the living God." John 6:66-69.

   BROTHERS AND SISTERS, we believe that the righteous shall hold on his
   way and he that has clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger. We
   also believe that he that believes in Christ "has everlasting life"
   and, consequently, must live forever. The living water which Christ
   gives a man shall be in him a well of water springing up unto
   everlasting life. Our Lord has said of His sheep that they shall never
   perish, neither shall any pluck them out of His hands. Yet we know that
   if any man draws back, the Lord will have no pleasure in him, and we
   are sure that, "without holiness no man shall see the Lord." Therefore
   we very heartily sing the verse in one of our hymns--

   "We ha ve no fear that You should lose

   One whom eternal love could choose;

   But we would never this Grace abuse,

   Let us not fall! Let us not fall!

   We consider that it would be an abusing of this Grace if we were to
   grow careless, presumptuous, high-minded and imagine that for
   ourselves, personally, it would not be possible to become apostates, or
   even to turn aside a little from the right way. We believe the Truth of
   God of the Final Perseverance of the Saints concerning the true people
   of God, but the question comes to our heart, Are we such? Is there in
   us the incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever? And how are
   we to know that we are such but by this very perseverance which, while
   it is an effect of Grace, is also one of the most certain tokens of it,
   for there is not the true Grace of God in the heart where there is no
   perseverance in Grace even unto the end.

   "He that endures to the end shall be saved." But what if we should only
   have the transient gleams of temporary illumination and should relapse
   into a thick Egyptian night? Here is cause enough for holy fear! Come,
   then, Brothers and Sisters, trusting in the Immutable Grace and love
   and power of God, let each man, nevertheless, examine himself and let
   this be a time of heart-searching. Say not this is out of place when we
   are just gathering around the table of the Lord, for is it not written,
   "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread"? Let us
   get ready to come to the festival of our Lord's Supper by putting our
   Lord's question, each one to His own heart, and trying to answer it by
   the help of God's own Spirit.

   First, the reason for the question--Why did Christ ask of the twelve,
   "Will you, also, go away?" Then, secondly, the question itself. And,
   thirdly, the answer which Peter most fitly gave to it, which, I doubt
   not, he gave in the name and on the behalf of all his Brothers. The
   same reply we would also give tonight-- "Lord, to whom shall we go? You
   have the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that You
   are the Christ, the Son of the living God."

   I. First, then, WHY DID THE SAVIOR ASK THE TWELVE THIS QUESTION? He
   would not have caused them needless pain. He had a wise reason for
   trying them with such an enquiry. It was, first, because it was a
   season of defection. "From that time many went back and walked no more
   with Him." You will find, I think, that in all Churches there are times
   of flocking in, when many fly to the Church like doves to their
   windows. But happy is that Church which never has a time of flying out,
   when numbers who have been tested, fail, and are no more to be found.
   Churches have summers, like our gardens, and then all things are full.
   But then come their winters and, alas, what emptying is seen!

   Have we not all seen the flood when the tide has come up far upon the
   beach? And have we not all marked the ebb when every wave has seemed to
   fall short of that which preceded it? Such ebbs and floods there are in
   the history of the

   Kingdom of Christ. One day, "The kingdom of God suffers violence and
   every man presses into it." At another time men seem to be ashamed of
   the Christian faith and they wander off into a thousand delusions--and
   the Church is diminished and brought low by heresy, by worldliness, by
   lukewarmness and by all sorts of evils.

   Often may the chronicle run thus--"Then all the disciples forsook Him
   and fled." It is right, then, at times when those that did run well are
   hindered, that the Master should say to those who, for a while, remain
   steadfast, "Will you, also, go away?" Ah, dear Friends, some of you are
   very steadfast now while this Church flourishes--how would you be if
   the pastor were dead, or his name in ill-repute? How would you be if
   the attendance on the means of Grace grew slack? How would you be if
   there was a decline in all the work of the Church? Have you backbone
   enough in you to be faithful if all others were faithless? Is there the
   real grit about you? Could you dare to be Daniels and, "dare to stand
   alone"? Can you fight a losing battle? Can you stand in the gap and be
   the last of a few heroic men who will defend the pass against all
   comers?

   Alas, what numbers swim with the tide! How few can swim against the
   current! How readily are men seized with panic and run for it with
   might and main if they see others hastening from the battle. How few
   can hold the bridge like Horatius in the brave days of old! Well may
   the Savior ask the question of us tonight, for we are as frail and
   fickle as others! Well may He ask it now, for worse times than these
   may be drawing near-- "Will you, also, go away?" It was a time, too, of
   defection among disciples. I call your attention to the use of that
   word here. "From that time many of His disciples went back." Disciples?
   Yes, not merely camp-followers! Not the mob that hung upon His skirts
   for the sake of the loaves and fishes, but some of His disciples went
   back--those of nobler spirit, who had listened to His words and, for a
   while had professed to call Him, "Master and Lord"

   Even some of these deserted the standard. Their name remains--they are
   called "disciples," still, though they have gone back! And this sets
   forth the grievous guilt of such men and women as enter into the Church
   and then, after a while, turn aside to false doctrine or to sin. They
   depart with their Prince's uniform upon their backs and carry the
   livery of Christ into the service of Satan! The stamp of a disciple is
   upon each of them, still, though they are renegades and perverts! They
   will be judged as having been what they professed to be--and heavy will
   be their sentence as apostates. We read of "Simon, the leper." He is
   called, "the leper" after He had been healed. Here, on the other hand,
   are some who bear their good name even after their villainy has been
   discovered--and this helps to make their treachery the more glaring.

   Just as the name, "harlot," stuck to Rahab after she had become an
   honest woman and a Believer, so does a good name stick to one after it
   has ceased to be true--and it remains as a reminder of their fearful
   folly. Go and live down Turncoat Lane. Hide yourself away as much as
   you can, but whenever you come into the street, if they do not say it
   to your face, the neighbors will whisper behind your back, "There goes
   one who was a disciple. There is one who professed to be a follower of
   Christ, but he has turned his back upon his Lord." The memory of your
   profession will stick to you through life! It will stick to you
   throughout eternity! If you are a wolf in sheep's clothing, some flecks
   of the wool will hang about you long after you have dragged the fleece
   over your head. Damnable apostate shall be your brand, even when you
   are cast away from the face of God forever! Oh, that none of us might
   ever earn such a title, by being reckoned among the disciples that went
   back and walked no more with Jesus! Yet, when disciples fall away, it
   is time to ask other disciples, "Will you, also, go away?"

   The defection in this case was on account of doctrine. Our Savior had
   done nothing that could vex His followers; He had not even spoken
   sharply to His disciples. Far from it. He had simply preached the
   glorious Truth of God that He is the Food of the new-born life. But
   this they did not understand and so they would listen no further and
   would not stay to ask an explanation. They went back at once, as if
   horrified at what they heard. The Truth was too hard for them; it was
   not to be borne with. "It is a hard saying. Who can bear it?" A true
   disciple sits at the feet of his Master and believes what he is told
   even when he cannot quite comprehend the meaning, or see the reasons
   for what his Master utters. But these men had not the essential spirit
   of a disciple and, consequently, when their Instructor began to unfold
   the innermost parts of the roll of Truth, they would not listen to His
   reading of it.

   They would believe as far as they could understand, but when they could
   not comprehend, they turned on their heels and left the school of the
   Great Teacher. Besides, the Lord Jesus Christ had taught the doctrine
   of the Sovereignty of God and of the need of the Spirit of God, that
   men should be led to Him, "for Jesus knew from the beginning who they
   were

   that believed not, and who should betray Him. And He said, Therefore
   said I unto you, that no man can come unto Me, except it were given
   unto Him of my Father." Here our Lord uttered a bit of the
   old-fashioned doctrine of Free Grace, such as people nowadays do not
   like. They call it, "Calvinism," and put it aside among the old
   exploded tenets which this enlightened age knows nothing of!

   What right they have to ascribe to the Genevan reformer a doctrine old
   as the hills I do not know! But our Lord Jesus never hesitated to fling
   that Truth of God into the face of His enemies! He told them, "You
   believe not, because you are not of My sheep, as I said unto you." No
   man can come to Me, except the Father which has sent Me draw Him." Here
   He tells them plainly that they could not come unto Him unless the
   Father gave them the Grace to come! This humbling doctrine they could
   not receive and so they went aside. Now, when the Truth of God, itself,
   becomes a stumbling block--when the Gospel, itself, which ought to draw
   men to Heaven becomes the reason why they go back--it is time for us to
   suspect ourselves and to--

   "Think we hear the Sa vior say,

   Will you forsake Me too?"

   "Will not you, also, be staggered? Will not some Truth stumble you?
   Will not some mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven make you, also, to be
   scandalized?" Blessed is the man that is not offended in Christ! Happy
   is he who lays aside his own wisdom to be taught of the Lord!

   Further, it is worthy of notice that this question was put because many
   were not only going away from Christ, but they were going back. Read
   the words. They, "went back and walked no more with Him." They did not
   go off to the right or to the left, making some slight departure from
   the straight road, but they turned deliberately around and went back,
   reversing their course and retracing their steps. Of course, in
   consequence of this, they were very soon what they used to be! The
   reclaimed drunk went back to his cups--the cups were soon full, again,
   and he was soon wallowing in drink, like a sow in the mire. The man who
   had lived a lascivious life and, for a time, had cast it off to put on
   the garb of morality, went back. And you saw him once again in the
   house of the strange woman. "The dog has returned to his vomit."

   The reformed liar was again false. The thief was again pilfering. The
   swearer was again profane. They went back, like Pliable, who quit the
   Pilgrim Road and returned to the City of Destruction. Now, it is really
   a dreadful thing, when men have seen the folly of their lives and have
   come out of it, for them to go back to their former habits. Well said
   the Prophet, "Let them not turn, again, to folly." But, alas, these
   burned children ran to the fire, again! The silly moths made another
   dash at the candle! They were well-nigh escaped, but they plunged,
   again, into the flood of iniquity! What is to become of them? Is not
   this the fear--that their last end shall be terrible because of the
   violence done to conscience and to the Word of the Lord?

   The evil spirit went out of them and took his walks abroad. But soon he
   went back, again, and found the house empty, swept and garnished! He,
   therefore, takes unto himself seven other spirits more wicked than
   himself and the last end of that man will be worse than the first! I
   should not have believed it, though a man had declared it to me, that
   such a one could go back, for he seemed so sick of sin, so wearied with
   its bondage! I could imagine that he might step aside under a strong
   temptation, but to go back--how can that be? Why, this is the man who
   was converted from drunkenness and delivered temperance lectures! Is he
   a drunk, again? This is the man that had clean escaped from his former
   filthiness and warned others! Is he wallowing in lust, again? What
   fools!

   What a multitude of fools in one is such a man! If his course was wise,
   why did he leave it? And if it were wise to leave it, why has he gone
   back to it? If it is right to go back to it, why did he not always
   continue in it? For this unmitigated folly, his blood will be upon his
   own head! But when we see rational men act thus, even men of whom we
   hoped better things, we need not be surprised that we, also, are put to
   a stand with the personal question, "Will you, also, go away?" In the
   case before us, the defection from Christ was open defection, for we
   read, "They went back, and walked no more with Him." They once walked
   with Jesus in the public streets, but now they will have no more to do
   with Christ.

   When Jesus preached--these constant hearers--where were they? When He
   worked a miracle--these admiring lookers-on--where were they? They had
   ministered to Him of their substance--no more supplies come from them.
   They had often asked Him to explain the Word when He had spoken in
   public--they desire no more secret interviews. They had asked Him,
   also, to teach them how to pray. But they no longer care to be found
   upon their knees. They are not

   hypocrites enough to keep step with Him when their hearts are not with
   Him. They are, at least, decent enough to walk no more with Him, now
   that they have gone back to their sins!

   Alas, we know some that used to walk with Christ who, at this time,
   walk no more with His people, for their hearts have gone away from
   Christ. The Sabbath is ignored. The House of God is forsaken. The Bible
   is put away; prayer is a thing neglected and, perhaps, despised! They
   walk no more with Christ, for they prefer a broader or a smoother road.
   If anybody mentions to them what they used to be, they slink away and
   seem to say, "Never mention it again! We wish it to be ignored." I
   remember a household where the sons and daughters all professed to be
   converted to Christ, but some of the young people were fond of
   amusements that were not consistent with the profession of religion
   and, when they were found in such engagements, what did they do? Why,
   they blushed a little, but, by-and-by, they boldly declared that they
   had never been converted--that they were forced into it by persuasion
   and hurried on by excitement to do that which their better sense led
   them to regret!

   Their excuse was as false as their former profession! They knew that
   they acted of their own accord and that they willingly professed
   Christ. Alas, just as willingly, when they came in the way of
   temptation, they forsook Him! Ah, Apostate, it is all very well to say
   that you were persuaded and all that--but you know that you did
   deliberately confess your faith, or you would never have been baptized
   by us! You did deliberately seek membership with the Church of God, or
   you would not have been received! And on yourself must be the
   responsibility of it! If you have gone back from Christ, you must bear
   the shame in time and eternity!

   But when any do thus openly sever themselves from the companionship of
   the Crucified One, well may the question pass from heart to heart,
   "Will you, also, go away?" Thus have I introduced the question by
   giving the reason for it.

   II. Now, THE QUESTION ITSELF. The Master pressed it upon the
   disciples--"Will you, also, go away?" He

   might well press the question, for one of them would certainly do so.
   He said, "I have chosen you twelve!" Not many-- just twelve. "I have
   chosen you." A very prudent Chooser--much better able to judge than any
   of His ministers. "I have chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil."
   Are our pastors and elders likely to make a better selection? Is it
   likely that the percentage of deceit is less among us than in the
   Apostolic college?

   I would not like to say--it would be wrong to say--that one out of
   every 12 of Church members is a Judas. What right have I to say it? But
   if I were called upon to depose that I am certain that they are not, I
   dare not make so bold an assertion! I fear that the average of mankind
   in any place would, in all probability, be much the same as in our
   Lord's day--and possibly there may be a worse state of things in London
   than in Judea and Galilee. Still, if we conceive our case to be
   improved, yet a measure of danger exists. Is it true in the case of
   only one member of this Church that he will betray Christ? If it is,
   then let the question begin at the pulpit and go round to the youngest
   member, "Lord, is it I?"--a question suitable for this Table, for at
   this Table of fellowship it was asked by every one of the 12, "Lord, is
   it I?"

   Certainly, some among us--some one among us--will deny or sell his
   Master. God grant it be not I! Let each one breathe that prayer!
   Besides, the Master knew that all of them might do so. All of them
   might go away from Him--apart from His Grace, indeed, all of them
   would! There stood Peter, this very Peter who gave such a bold answer
   to the question--and the Master knew that there was enough in Peter to
   have made him as faithless as Judas if it had not been for His
   upholding Grace! Ah, Brothers and Sisters, when we see others fall,
   today, let us say, "It may be my case tomorrow!" Is there not the same
   heart, the same nature, the same tendency to sin? Have we not the same
   weakness? Are we not exposed to the same temptations?

   Is there not the same devil craftily searching out our infirmities,
   that he may work upon them? Are we not all in danger? I fear that he is
   especially in jeopardy who will say, tonight, "I am a man of
   experience. I am out of harm's way." If there is a Brother among us who
   says, "These warnings are not meant for me," he is probably the man who
   will disgrace that holy name by which he is named. If there is a
   deacon, an elder, a gray-headed Christian man, a venerable, believing
   woman, who shall be saying, "I have nothing to fear from temptation. I
   have passed out of the realm of caution and watchfulness," I stand in
   doubt of such! Confident Friend, I fear that you are the man! This
   carnal confidence, this proud presumption as to yourself should be a
   caution to you, for these things are the smoke which denote a
   smoldering fire!

   "Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall." The Master put
   the question because He knew that it ought to come home to every heart
   among the twelve. Moreover, He put the question to them because if they
   turned aside it would be especially sad. I do not read that Jesus said
   anything about those that had already gone back. He alludes to them by

   the use of the word, "also," but He does not seem to have ran after
   them to beg them to return. He knew what they were and knew that they
   were best apart from Him. When the chaff was blown away, it was only
   the fulfillment of John the Baptist's words, "His fan is in His hand
   and He shall thoroughly purge His floor," so He suffered the chaff to
   go to its own place. But when the Master looked at the 12, then He said
   with holy care and anxiety, "Will you? Will you, also, go away?" As
   much as to say, "If you go away, who have been with Me from the
   beginning, who have been chosen by me to be eyewitnesses of My life. If
   you that have been near My inmost heart and shared My trials and My
   joys--if you go away it will be sin, indeed."

   Friends, if any of us turn aside, what excuse shall be made for us? I
   say deliberately that if I go away from my Master I can expect nothing
   but the hottest wrath of God forever! Unhappy, unhappy wretch, to have
   preached to such multitudes, if I deny my Lord! Condemned out of my own
   mouth a thousand times over! I shall be a mark for all the arrows of
   vengeance. And what shall I say of my Brothers behind me, the deacons
   and elders of this Church? If they go away from Christ and forsake Him
   after their brave professions, who shall apologize for them? Many here
   are marked men and women! Your experience of Christ has been long,
   sweet, deep, remarkable--and you have spoken of it to others with much
   confidence and delight. If you go away, you will deserve to be hung up
   like Haman, on the gallows, fifty cubits high--an exhibition of direct
   treachery and a monument of the awful wrath of God against such as
   trample on the blood

   of Christ!

   You will be sinners above all the sinners of yours time! Oh, may it
   never be, for if one of the 12 shall do it, it will be the greatest sin
   of all! It will grieve the heart of the Master! It will open the mouths
   of blasphemers. It will afflict the saints. It will disgrace the
   apostates and bring down upon them infinite condemnation! And yet, do
   you know, when others are turning aside, the question has to be asked,
   for apostasy is very contagious. We are called sheep and it is of the
   nature of sheep that if one goes right, the next will follow. But if
   they meet with a gap in the hedge and one leaps through it, they will
   all follow the same road! When backsliding and apostasy become
   fashionable, you may ask, even the 12, "Will you, also, go away?"

   As I have seen, in my short experience, minister after minister turning
   aside to novelties of doctrine and especially into the deep pit of
   "modern thought"--into which the abhorred of the Lord fall--I have
   thought of one and of another, "Will you, also, go away?" As men that I
   have spoken with, prayed with and trusted in have, one by one,
   apostatized from the faith of God's elect, I have been staggered and
   astounded! Surely this fashionable sin has a fascinating influence over
   many minds and would delude, if it were possible, the very elect! How
   few stand to the landmarks in this age of wandering! How few are found
   approved in the day of trial! The question is one that must of
   necessity be pressed home, "Will you, also, go away?"

   And, to conclude this part of our subject, our Savior, I think, asks
   the question because He wishes His following to be always perfectly
   voluntary. We sometimes speak of "the sweet compulsions of Grace." But
   let it be always understood that this is by way of metaphor and figure,
   for none can truly walk with Jesus unwillingly. The lack of will would
   be fatal! There is an influence which the Grace of God exerts upon the
   will, by which the unrenewed will is led captive, and yet as soon as it
   is a renewed, will it becomes emphatically free. It ceases to be a will
   if it has no determining power--the Grace of God gives it that power to
   a high degree.

   Those who truly follow Christ do not follow Him because they are forced
   to do so. Grace has no slaves. It rules a Kingdom to which the Son has
   given true liberty! Christians are not dragged after Christ. They yield
   most sweetly to the charms of His love, to the force of the Truths of
   God which He teaches and the love which He manifests. They gladly serve
   their Lord and Master. Jesus seems to say, "If you do not serve Me so,
   you may go." Will you go? Christ does not need anybody to profess to be
   a Christian who does not wish to be a Christian. He does not need one
   to come to this Table because he thinks it to be a Light of God or a
   custom, by which he is bound! He wants you to come because you delight
   to do so.

   He does not desire any minister to preach the Gospel because he is paid
   for it, or because he would lose face among godly people if he did not.
   He needs no slaves to grace His Throne. The very charm of obedience is
   that it is rendered cheerfully. The very bliss of Christ's service is
   that we voluntarily, with all our heart and soul, take up his Cross and
   follow Him. I am not denying the compulsions of Grace. I am only saying
   that they are perfectly consistent with the absolute freedom of the
   gracious will! God treats men as men and not as heaps of brick and
   mortar. His Grace displays itself

   in converting and changing them as men that have wills--not as logs of
   wood which Solomon may cut and plane in the mountains without their
   consent.

   No, no! If you will to go, go! But if your will is to cling to Him,
   then will He give you Grace to follow Him, even to the end. I do not
   know whether I impress my congregation with a sense of the importance
   of the Truths of God I am trying to press home, but I feel them myself.
   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, it is a very easy thing to gather a crowd of
   people-- the difficulty is to hold together, year after year, those
   that profess to be converted! There is a constant winnowing going on in
   all Churches and this drives away the light and chaffy ones. There is a
   fan at work upon this floor! Some stay, year after year, and yet turn
   out to be of no account. The Lord goes on sifting, but certain of the
   chaff do not blow off at first because, perhaps, the wheat is lying on
   top of it--there is a good wife or holy mother or a godly husband that
   keeps the doubtful ones right. When these are taken away, the next
   blast of the winnowing fan sweeps that bit of chaff away.

   Oh, be not as the chaff, which is covered up and so hidden among the
   wheat! Turn not aside, I pray you! The Lord keep you. I shall reckon it
   to be a privilege to bury you rather than have to erase your name from
   our Church roll for conduct inconsistent with your profession! May you
   gather around my corpse, when God pleases to let me go Home, and may
   you say, "He lived an honorable life and died faithful to His Lord."
   Yes, let that gathering be before another Sabbath dawns, if God so
   wills, rather than that I should live to dishonor the precious Truths
   of God which I have preached, and turn aside from the Master whom I
   profess to love!

   What I say to myself I think I hear each one of you say to himself or
   herself, "Better far that we die than that we deny our Lord."

   III. I shall close with my third head and consider THE ANSWER WHICH
   QUICK-VOICED PETER GAVE--the

   answer which I hope we are prepared to give to our Divine Leader,
   "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. And we
   believe and are sure that you are the Christ, the Son of the living
   God." It is threefold. "Lord, to whom shall we go?" This is the first
   answer. Observe that Peter does not appear to think it possible, or
   think it less than abominable, for a man to go back--for the natural
   answer to Peter's question, "To whom shall we go?" is, "Go back?" No,
   but Peter does not tolerate the idea of going back.

   I ask you, my beloved Brother in Christ, can you tolerate it? Can you?
   Can you? I might address myself to a Brother who was once among the
   profane and the drunken, who is now among the most earnest of us. And I
   might ask him-- Brother, would you go back? I am sure that the thought
   of the rack would be more pleasant than the idea of returning to his
   old haunts! I might address myself to another who was fond of every
   form of gaiety, spending his money for that which was not bread, and
   his labor for that which did not satisfy him--he will be found among us
   tonight, happiest among the happy in the service of his Master, and I
   enquire of him--Brother, will you go back? Would you like to enjoy all
   your gay life again? It would be death to you.

   Suppose that any of us who know the joy of being Christ's could have it
   proposed to us to go back--suppose we were not immoral, but were
   everything that could be desired in our outward conduct--would we like
   to go back to that dead morality which had no life of faith nor light
   of hope about it? No! No! When Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress
   thought about going back, he remembered that he had no armor for his
   back. He had a breastplate. He was covered from head to foot by his
   shield--but there was nothing to protect his back and, therefore, if he
   retreated, the adversary could split him with a javelin in a moment! So
   he thought that, bad as it was to go forward, it would be worse to go
   backward and, therefore, he bravely cut a path for himself straight
   onward for Glory!

   Look at that fact whenever you are tempted! Do not endure the idea of
   turning tail in the day of battle! May retreat be impossible to you.
   God make it impossible by His Grace! But then to whom should we go? I
   was ruminating in my mind the other day--

   "Could I so false, so faithless prove

   To quit Your service and Your love,

   Where, Lord, could I Your Presence shun,

   Or from Your dreadful Glory run?" Where could I retire if I would avoid
   my lifework and cease witnessing for Jesus? If I were on board ship and
   a storm came, the sailors would say, "He is the Jonah." I know they
   would! If I forsook my God and His cause, the lowest and meanest would
   point at me as a turncoat. If I were to cross the western continent and
   hide away in the back settlements, it

   is 10 to one that if I went into the most remote log cabin, somebody
   would spy me out, and say, "Why, you are the man whose sermons I read
   in our newspapers. Why are you here?"

   In the loneliest spots on earth, where men speak the English tongue, my
   own sermons would serve as a hue and cry, if not as a writ of arrest. I
   should be sure to hear the question, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
   and how could I answer? Where could I go? No hiding place remains for
   me! I must serve God forever. So is it with you in a degree, dear
   Friends. You cannot get away from Jesus. You that are disciples have
   committed yourselves to Christ. There is nowhere for you to go. Suppose
   you were to try infidelity. You know too much. You have felt too much.
   Unbelief would not ease you, whatever it may do with others. Be a
   free-thinker? Well, you are made of the wrong stuff for that--your
   conscience would trouble you. Suppose you became a Romanist? Would
   forms and ceremonies content you? No! Of all the people in the world
   that cannot be Romanists, commend me to Baptists!

   A few have joined the church of Rome--so few that I never knew but one.
   You cannot convert these dreadful Anabaptists! They are too positive
   and too much accustomed to prefer their own judgment to the directions
   of a ghostly father in Rome! My Brothers and Sisters, I do not know
   where you could go if you leave Jesus and the Truth of God. You can go
   down to the bottomless pit, if you will, but you will have no rest
   there, for the lost ones will cry, "Have you come here? Why, you were
   at the Lord's Table, were you not? You are the people that used to give
   away tracts. Did we not hear you preach at the corner of the streets?"
   It will be an uneasy thing for you to be lost, I tell you, Sirs, 10
   times worse than for others, for the hiss of those who never professed
   religion will follow you throughout eternity--and their words will burn
   like coals of juniper when they cry, "Hypocrite! Apostate! You knew the
   Truth and did it not!"

   There is nowhere else for us to go. If we are weary of our Master, we
   cannot get another--where can we find another so good as He is? Shall
   we go back, or shall we get right with Him? Let us go at once and tell
   Him how foolish we have been. Let us beg Him to keep us in His House.
   "Dismiss me not from Your service, Lord." I am not worthy, even, to
   unloose the laces of Your shoes, but let me be Your servant, for whom
   else can I serve? How else can I live? What other joy remains for me
   but to do something for Your blessed name?

   But then Peter gave a second answer. He said to our Lord, "You have the
   words of eternal life," as much as to say, "We cannot go away from You,
   good Master, when we think of eternity." Oh, eternity! Eternity! Those
   who, for a little wealth, or to escape a foolish laugh, shall turn
   aside from Christ--what will they do in eternity? Those who, to be
   thought respectable, or to be considered clever, shall renounce the
   simple Gospel of Christ--what will they do in eternity? Christ, alone,
   can give eternal life, or life for eternity! Apart from Him we are cast
   out as dead. The unbelievers shall be banished forever from the
   Presence of God and the Glory of His power, for, "God is not the God of
   the dead, but of the living." Brothers and Sisters, we believe that
   there is salvation in Christ and nowhere else. How can we leave Him,

   then?

   We know and are sure that His Word has already put the immortal life
   into us, for we feel it pulsing within our being! We sometimes see
   glimmerings of the eternal day into which the Light of God we have is
   sure to develop--and we are certain that the Lord has given us eternal
   life by His Word. How, then, can we forsake Him? Bind us, Savior--bind
   us to Yourself! Come, brand us with the Cross! Let us bear in our body
   Your mark! Some of us wear the watermark upon our whole body. Our seal
   of the Covenant is not on some one portion of our frame, but we have
   been immersed into Your name and from head to foot we are Yours. We
   cannot undo the fact that we were buried with You by Baptism unto
   death. Yours by that outward sign, but yet much more Yours by the
   inward Grace which You have given, by which You have made us dead to
   the world, dead to self and quickened us unto eternal life in Yourself.

   There are two ties, then, to hold us. The one is that we have nowhere
   else to go. And the second is that we have no life apart from Christ.
   The third holdfast is this--"We believe and are sure that You are the
   Christ, the Son of the living God." Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for
   flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you." Have you learned, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, that Christ is truly the Messiah, the Son of the
   Father? Do you believe it? And, more than that, do you both believe and
   know that Christ is also the Son of the Highest? How can we leave Him?
   Has God sent Him and shall we forsake Him? Is He God and shall we
   desert Him? No, good Master, at Your feet we fall and to those feet we
   cling! We humbly resolve, by Your good Spirit's power to abide in You.
   Savior, we will be Yours forever!

   You may speak this very boldly if you speak it in the confidence of
   Grace, for, Brothers and Sisters, "Who shall separate us from the love
   of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord?" What torments the saints
   have endured from their perse-

   cutors and how ineffectual have been the assaults of their foes to
   separate them from Christ! If we are really one with Christ, Satan can
   no more tear us away from Jesus than he could tear away Paul or John!
   These saints had no more power of their own than we have--they derived
   everything from Christ--and we do the same. Think of how the martyrs
   have been scourged and even flayed alive--and yet have cried out--"None
   but Christ!" They have been tied to the tails of horses and dragged to
   death, but never a thought of apostatizing has occurred to them.

   In those early days men, women and children crowded the tribunals till
   the judges grew weary of their bloody task. The persecutors devised all
   kinds of tortures, such as I scarcely dare mention, but the saints of
   God triumphed over all their torments! Fierce was the duel between the
   infernal cruelty of Roman paganism and the splendor of God within the
   souls of faithful men and women! Look even later down at our own Marian
   persecutions--when Smithfield was all aglow with the death of the
   saints--how gloriously Believers defeated their adversaries!

   We read of a holy woman, bearing a child in prison, crying out in labor
   and her tormentors exultingly demanded, "If you cannot bear these
   pangs, how will you bear to be burnt alive in a few days' time?" She
   replied, "You see in me, who am a woman, the feebleness of nature. But
   wait till the day comes and you shall see in me, who am a member of the
   body of Christ, the strength of Grace, for I shall never start or cry
   when I am burning for Christ!" And they took note that she never
   flinched, or winced, or cried, or stirred, but quick to the death she
   burned in her confession of her Lord! Oh, it was amazing! It was
   amazing! Christ laughed at His mightiest enemies, but His Spirit rested
   upon His poor, feeble saints and strengthened them so that they were
   more than conquerors!

   Think of Ann Askew, whom I often quote--our own Ann Askew--sitting up
   after they had racked her till every bone was dragged from its fellow
   and still defending the faith against the Romish shavelings! O that we
   had the same Grace! We shall have it when the trial comes, for "the
   Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge." If Jesus is,
   indeed, the Anointed of the Lord, He will anoint us in the hour of
   need! And because we believe and are sure that it is even so, we are
   bold to say in His strength, "No, Lord, we will never leave You! Though
   all men shall forsake You, yet we will not." By Your faithfulness, O
   Lord, keep us faithful! Amen.

The Dream of Pilate's Wife

   (No. 1647)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 26, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him,
   saying, Have you nothing to do with thatjust Man: for I have suffered
   many things this day in a dream because of Him." Matthew 27:19.

   I EARNESTLY wished to pursue the story of our Savior's trials previous
   to His Crucifixion, but when I sat down to study the subject I found
   myself altogether incapable of the exercise. "When I thought to know
   this, it was too painful for me." My emotions grew so strong and my
   sense of our Lord's grief became so extremely vivid that I felt I must
   waive the subject for a time. I could not watch with Him another hour
   and yet I could not leave the hallowed scene! It was, therefore, a
   relief to meet with the episode of Pilate's wife and her dream. It
   enables me to continue the thread of my narrative and yet to relax the
   extreme tension of the feelings caused by a near view of the Master's
   grief and shame.

   My spirit failed before the terrible sight. I thought I saw Him brought
   back from Herod where the men of war had set Him at naught. I followed
   Him through the streets, again, as the cruel priests pushed through the
   crowd and hastened Him back to Pilate's hall. I thought I heard them in
   the streets electing Barabbas, the robber, to be set free, instead of
   Jesus, the Savior, and I detected the first rising of that awful cry,
   "Crucify, crucify," which they shrieked out from their bloodthirsty
   throats! And there He stood, who loved me and gave Himself for me, like
   a lamb in the midst of wolves, with none to pity and none to help Him.

   The vision overwhelmed me, especially when I knew that the next stage
   would be that Pilate, who had cleared Him, by declaring, "I find no
   fault in Him," would give Him over to the tormentors that He might be
   scourged, that the mercenary soldiery would crown Him with thorns and
   mercilessly insult Him--and that He would be brought forth to the
   people and announced to them with those heart-rending words, "Behold
   the Man!" Was there ever sorrow like His sorrow? Rather than speak
   about it this day, I feel inclined to act like Job's friends, of whom
   it is written, that at the sight of him, "they lifted up their voices
   and wept; and sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
   nights, and none spoke a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was
   very great."

   We leave the Master awhile to look at this dream of Pilate's wife which
   is only spoken of once in the Scriptures--by Matthew. I know not why
   only that Evangelist should have been commissioned to record it.
   Perhaps he, alone, heard of it, but the one record is sufficient for
   our faith--and long enough to furnish food for meditation. We receive
   the story as certified by the Holy Spirit. Pilate, throughout his term
   of office, had grossly misbehaved himself. He had been an unjust and
   unscrupulous ruler of the Jews. The Galileans and the Samaritans, both,
   felt the terror of his arms, for he did not hesitate to massacre them
   at the slightest sign of revolt. And among the Jews, he had sent men
   with daggers into the midst of the crowds at the great gatherings and
   so had cut off those who were obnoxious to him.

   Gain was his objective and pride ruled his spirit. At the time when
   Jesus of Nazareth was brought before him, a complaint against him was
   on the way to Tiberius the Emperor, and he feared lest he should be
   called to account for his oppressions, extortions and murders. His sins
   at this moment were beginning to punish him, as Job would word it, "The
   iniquities of his heels compassed him about." One terrible portion of
   the penalty of sin is its power to force a man to commit yet farther
   iniquity. Pilate's transgressions were now howling around him like a
   pack of wolves--he could not face them and he had not Grace to flee to
   the One Great Refuge!

   But his fears drove him to flee before them and there was no way,
   apparently, open for him but that which led him into yet deeper
   abominations. He knew that Jesus was without a single fault and yet,
   since the Jews clamored for His death, he felt that he must yield to
   their demands, or else they would raise another accusation against him,
   namely, that he was not loyal to the sovereignty of Caesar, for he had
   allowed One to escape who had called Himself a King. If he had behaved
   justly, he would not have been afraid of the chief priests and scribes.
   Innocence is brave, but guilt is cowardly.

   Pilate's old sins found him out and made him weak in the presence of
   the ignoble crew, whom otherwise he would have driven from the judgment
   seat.

   He had power enough to have silenced them, but he had not sufficient
   decision of character to end the contention. The power was gone from
   his mind because he knew that his conduct would not bear investigation
   and he dreaded the loss of his office, which he held only for his own
   ends. See there with pity that scornful but vacillating creature
   wavering in the presence of men who were more wicked than himself and
   more determined in their purpose! The fell determination of the wicked
   priests caused hesitating policy to quail in their presence and Pilate
   was driven to do what he would gladly have avoided. The manner and the
   words of Jesus had impressed Pilate. I say the manner of Jesus, for His
   matchless meekness must have struck the governor as being a very
   unusual thing in a prisoner.

   He had seen, in captured Jews, the fierce courage of fanaticism, but
   there was no fanaticism in Christ! He had also seen in many prisoners
   the meanness which will do or say anything to escape from death--but he
   saw nothing of that about our Lord. He saw in Him unusual gentleness
   and humility combined with majestic dignity. He beheld submission
   blended with innocence! This made Pilate feel how awful goodness is. He
   was impressed--he could not help being impressed with this unique
   Sufferer. Besides, our Lord had before him witnessed a good
   confession--you remember how we considered it the other day--and though
   Pilate had huffed it off with the pert question, "What is truth?" and
   had gone back into the judgment hall, yet there was an arrow fixed
   within him which he could not shake off.

   It may have been mainly superstition, but he felt an awe of One whom he
   half suspected to be an extraordinary Person. He felt that he, himself,
   was placed in a very extraordinary position, being asked to condemn One
   whom he knew to be perfectly innocent. His duty was clear enough--he
   could never have had a question about that--but duty was nothing to
   Pilate in comparison with his own interests! He would spare the Just
   One if he could do so without endangering himself, but his cowardly
   fears lashed him on to the shedding of innocent blood. At the very
   moment when he was vacillating--when he had proffered to the Jews the
   choice of Barabbas, or Jesus of Nazareth. At that very moment, I say,
   when he had taken his seat upon the bench and was waiting for their
   choice--there came from the hand of God a warning to him--a warning
   which would forever make it clear that if he condemned Jesus, it would
   be done voluntarily by his own guilty hands.

   Jesus must die by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God and
   yet, it must be by wicked hands that He is crucified and slain. And,
   therefore, Pilate must not sin in ignorance. A warning to Pilate came
   from his own wife concerning her morning's dream, a vision of mystery
   and terror--warning him not to touch that just Person--"For," she said,
   "I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of Him." There
   are times in most men's lives when, though they have been wrong, yet
   they have not quite been set on mischief, but have come to a pause and
   have deliberated as to their way. And then God, in great mercy, has
   sent them a caution and has set up a danger signal bidding them stop in
   their mad career before they plunged themselves finally into
   irretrievable ruin! Somewhere in that direction lies the subject of our
   present discourse. O that the Spirit of God may make it useful to many!

   I. And, first, I call your attention to THE COOPERATION OF PROVIDENCE
   WITH THE WORK OF GOD. I call it the work of God to warn men against sin
   and I call your attention to Providence working with it to bring the
   preventives and cautions of Divine Mercy home to men's minds. For,
   first, observe the Providence of God in sending this dream. If anything
   beneath the moon may be thought to be exempt from law and to be the
   creature of pure chance, surely it is a dream! True, there were, in old
   times, dreams in which God spoke to men prophetically--but ordinarily
   they are the carnival of thought, a maze of mental states--a dance of
   disorder!

   The dreams which would naturally come to the wife of a Roman governor
   would not be likely to have much of tenderness or conscience in them
   and would not, in all probability, of themselves, run in the line of
   mercy. Dreams ordinarily are the most disorderly of phenomena and yet
   it seems that they are ordered of the Lord. I can well understand that
   every drop of spray which flashes from the wave, when it dashes against
   the cliff, has its appointed orbit as truly as the stars of Heaven--but
   the thoughts of men appear to be utterly lawless, especially the
   thoughts of men when deep sleep falls upon them! As well might one
   foretell the flight of a bird as the course of a dream!

   Such wild fantasies seem to be ungoverned and ungovernable. Many things
   operate naturally to fashion a dream. Dreams frequently depend upon the
   condition of the stomach, upon the meat and drink taken by the sleeper
   before going to rest. They often owe their shape to the state of the
   body or the agitation of the mind. Dreams may, no doubt, be caused

   by that which transpires in the chamber of the house--a little movement
   of the bed caused by passing wheels, or the tramp of a band of men, or
   the passing of a domestic across the floor--or even the running of a
   mouse behind the wainscot may suggest and shape a dream.

   Any slight matter affecting the senses at such time may raise within
   the slumbering mind a mob of strange ideas. Yet whatever may have
   operated in this lady's case, the hand of Providence was in it all, and
   her mind, though fancy free, wandered nowhere but just according to the
   will of God to effect the Divine purpose! She must dream just so and no
   way else! And that dream must be of such-and-such an order, and none
   other! Even dreamland knows no god but God and even phantoms and
   shadows come and go at His bidding--neither can the images of a night
   vision escape from the supreme authority of the Most High.

   See the Providence of God in the fact that the dream of Pilate's wife,
   however caused, should be of such a form and come at such a time as
   this! Certain old writers trace her dream to the devil, who thus hoped
   to prevent the death of our Lord and so prevent our redemption. I do
   not agree with the notion! But even if it were so, I admire all the
   more the Providence which overrules even the devices of Satan for the
   purposes of wisdom! Pilate must be warned so that his sentence may be
   his own act and deed. And that warning is given him through his wife's
   dream. So does Providence work.

   Note, next, the Providence of God in arranging that with this dream
   there should be great mental suffering. "I have suffered many things in
   a dream concerning Him!" I cannot tell what vision passed before her
   mind's eye, but it was one which caused her terrible agony. A modern
   artist has painted a picture of what he imagined the dream to be, but I
   shall not attempt to follow that great man in the exercise of fancy.
   Pilate's wife may have realized in her sleep the dreadful spectacle of
   the crown of thorns and the scourge, or even of the Crucifixion and the
   death agony. And, truly, I know of nothing more calculated to make the
   heart suffer many things concerning the Lord Jesus than a glance at His
   death! Around the Cross there gathers grief enough to cause many a
   sleepless night if the soul has any tenderness left in it.

   Or her dream may have been of quite another kind. She may have seen in
   vision the Just One coming in the clouds of Heaven. Her mind may have
   pictured Him upon the Great White Throne, even the Man whom her husband
   was about to condemn to die. She may have seen her husband brought
   forth to judgment, himself a prisoner to be tried by the Just One, who
   had before been accused before him. She may have awaken, startled at
   the shriek of her husband as he fell back into the Pit that knows no
   bottom! Whatever it was, she had suffered repeated painful emotions in
   the dream, and she awoke startled and amazed! The terror of the night
   was upon her and it threatened to become a terror to her for all her
   days and she, therefore, hastens to stay her husband's hand.

   Now, herein is the hand of God and the simple story goes to prove that
   the wandering of dreamland are still under His control--and He can
   cause them to produce distress and anguish--if some grand end is to be
   served thereby. Equally remarkable is it that she should have sent to
   her husband the message, "Have nothing to do with that just Man." Most
   dreams we quite forget. A few we mention as remarkable, but only now
   and then is one impressed upon us so that we remember it for years.
   Scarcely have any of you had a dream which made you send a message to a
   magistrate upon the bench. Such an intention would only be resorted to
   in an urgent case. Though the judge were your own husband, you would be
   very hard-pressed before you would worry him with your dreams while he
   was occupied with important public business.

   Mostly a dream may wait till business is over. But so deep was the
   impression upon this Roman lady's mind that she does not wait until her
   lord comes home, but sends to him at once. Her advice is urgent--"Have
   you nothing to do with that just Man." She must warn him now, before he
   has laid a stroke on Him, much less stained his hands in His blood.
   Not, "Have a little to do and scourge Him and let Him go," but, "Have
   you nothing to do with Him. Say not an unkind word, nor do Him any
   injury! Deliver Him from His adversaries! If He must die, let it be by
   some other hand than yours! My Husband, my Husband, my Husband, I
   beseech you, have nothing to do with that just Man. Let Him alone, I
   pray you!"

   She words her message very emphatically. "Have you nothing to do with
   that just Man: for I have suffered many things in a dream concerning
   Him. Think of your wife! Think of yourself! Let my sufferings about
   this Holy One be a warning to you. For my sake let Him alone!" And yet,
   do you know, her message, to my ear, sounds rather authoritative for a
   woman to her husband, and he a judge! There is a tone about it that is
   not ordinarily in the address of wives to husbands. "Have you nothing
   to do with this just Man: for I have suffered many things this day in a
   dream because of Him."

   It shows a wonderful Providence of God that this lady was moved to send
   so strong a message to her self-willed husband--to beseech, to entreat,
   to implore--almost to demand of him that he let this just Man go. O
   Providence, how mightily can you work! O Lord, the seraphim obey You,
   but You find an equally willing servitor in a wife who, at Your
   bidding, stands between her husband and a crime!

   Once more, about this Providence I want you to notice the peculiar time
   in which her warning came. It was evidently a dream of the morning--"I
   have suffered many things in a dream this day." The day had not long
   broken--it was yet early in the morning. The Romans had a superstition
   that morning dreams are true. I suppose it was after her husband had
   left her that she thus dreamed. If I may be allowed not to state a
   fact, but to make a conjecture, which seems to me most probable, she
   was a dearly beloved wife, but sickly and, therefore, needed to rest
   further into the day than her husband. And when he had left his couch,
   she had yet another sleep. And being a sensitive person and all the
   more likely to dream, she awoke from her morning sleep oppressed with a
   terror which she could not shake off. Pilate was gone and she was told
   that he was in the judgment hall.

   She asked her attendants why he was there so early and they replied
   that there had been an unusual clamor in the courtyard, for the High
   Priests and a mob of Jews had been there and the governor had gone out
   to them. They might, perhaps, also tell her that Jesus of Nazareth was
   brought there a prisoner and the priests were entreating Pilate to put
   Him to death, though they had heard the governor say that he found no
   fault in Him. "Go," she said to her maid, "call to one of the guards
   and bid him go at once to my husband and say what I tell you. Let him
   speak aloud, that some of the cruel Jews may hear it, and be moved from
   their cruel purpose. Let him say that I implore my husband to have
   nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things this
   very morning in a dream concerning Him."

   Just at the moment, you see, when Pilate had sat down on the judgment
   seat, the warning came to him. When there was a little lull and he was
   anxious to acquit his Prisoner--at that instant of time which was the
   most hopeful, this weight was thrown into the right side of the
   scale--thrown in most wisely and mercifully to keep back Pilate from
   his grievous sin. The warning came at the nick of time, as we say,
   though, alas, it came in vain! Admire the punctuality of Providence!
   God never is before His time. He never is too late. It shall be seen
   concerning all that He does that on the same day determined by the
   prophecy, the fulfillment came. My soul stands trembling while she
   sings the glory of her God, whose Providence is high, even like
   Ezekiel's wheels! But the wheels are full of eyes and, as they turn,
   all the surroundings are observed and provided for so that there are no
   slips, or oversights, or accidents, or delays. Prompt and effectual is
   the operation of the Lord!

   Thus much concerning Providence and I think you will all agree that my
   point is proven--that Providence is always co-working with the Grace of
   God. A great writer who knows but little about Divine things, yet,
   nevertheless, tells us that he perceives a power in the world which
   works for righteousness. Exactly so! It is well spoken, for this is the
   chief of all powers! When you and I go out to warn men of sin, we are
   not alone, all Providence is at our back! When we preach Christ
   Crucified, we are workers, together, with God! God is working with us
   as well as by us! Everything that happens is driving towards the end
   for which we work when we seek to convince men of sin and of
   righteousness. Where the Spirit of God is, all the forces of Nature and
   Providence are mustered!

   The fall of empires, the death of despots, the rising up of nations,
   the making or the breaking of treaties, terrific wars and blighting
   famines--are all working out the grand end! Yes, and domestic matters,
   such as the death of children, the sickness of wives, the loss of work,
   the poverty of the family and a thousand other things are working,
   working, always working for the improvement of men. And you and I,
   lending our poor feebleness to cooperate with God, are marching with
   all the forces of the universe! Have comfort, then, in this, O workers
   for Jesus! Suffering many things for Him, be of good courage, for the
   stars in their courses fight for the servants of the living God! And
   the stones of the field are in league with you!

   II. Secondly, I gather from this story THE ACCESSIBILITY OF CONSCIENCE
   TO GOD. How are we to reach Pilate? How are we to warn him? He has
   rejected the voice of Jesus and the sight of Jesus--could not Peter be
   fetched to expostulate with him? Alas, Peter has denied his Master.
   Could not John be brought in? Even he has forsaken the Lord! Where
   shall a messenger be found? It shall be found in a dream--God can get
   at men's hearts, however hardened they may be. Never give them up,
   never despair of awakening them. If my ministry, your ministry and the
   ministry of the

   blessed Book should all seem to be nothing, God can reach the
   conscience by a dream! If the sword comes not at them at close
   quarters, yet what seems but a stray arrow from a bow drawn at a
   venture shall find the joints in their harness.

   We ought to believe in God about wicked men and never say of them, "It
   is impossible that they should be converted." The Lord can wound
   leviathan, for His weapons are many and they are suited to the foe. I
   do not think a dream would operate upon my mind to convince me, but
   certain minds lie open in that direction, and to them a dream may be a
   power. God may use even superstition to accomplish His beneficent
   purposes. Many besides Pilate have been warned by dreams. Better still,
   Pilate was accessible through the dream of his wife. Henry Melvill has
   a very wonderful discourse upon this topic, in which he tries to show
   that probably, if Pilate had dreamed this dream, himself, it would not
   have been so operative upon him as when his wife dreamed it. He takes
   it as a supposition, which nobody can deny, that Pilate had an
   affectionate and tender wife who was very dear to him. The one brief
   narrative which we have of her certainly looks that way--it is evident
   that she loved her husband dearly--and would, therefore, prevent his
   acting unjustly to Jesus.

   To send a warning by her was to reach Pilate's conscience through his
   affections. If his beloved wife was distressed, it would be sure to
   weigh heavily with him, for he would not have her troubled. He would
   gladly shield his tender one from every breath of wind and give her
   perfect comfort. And when she pleads, it is his delight to yield. It
   is, therefore, no small trouble to him that she is suffering--suffering
   so much as to send a message to him. She was suffering because of One
   who deserves her good opinion--One whom Pilate, himself, knows to be
   without fault. If this lady was, indeed, the wife of Pilate's youth,
   tender and dearly beloved, and if she was gradually sickening before
   his eyes, her pale face would rise before his loving memory and her
   words would have boundless power over him when she said, "I have
   suffered many things in a dream."

   O Claudia Procula, if that were your name, well did the Lord of Mercy
   entrust His message to your persuasive lips, for from you it would come
   with tenfold influence! Tradition declares this lady to have been a
   Christian and the Greek Church has placed her in their calendar as a
   saint. For this we have no evidence--all that we know is that she was
   Pilate's wife and used her wifely influence to stay him from this
   crime. How often has a tender, suffering, loving woman exercised great
   power over a coarse, rough man! The All-Wise One knows this and,
   therefore, He often speaks to sinful men by this influential agency. He
   converts one in a family that she may be His missionary to the rest.
   Thus He speaks with something better than the tongues of men and of
   angels, for He uses Love, itself, to be His orator.

   Affection has more might than eloquence. That is why, my Friend, God
   sent you, for a little while, that dear child who prattled to you about
   the Savior! She is gone to Heaven, now, but the music of her little
   hymns rings in your ears even now and her talk about Jesus and the
   angels is yet with you. She has been called Home, but God sent her to
   you for a season to charm you to Himself and win you to the right way.
   Thus He bade you cease from sin and turn to Christ. And that dear
   mother of yours, who is now before the Throne of God, do you remember
   what she said to you when she was dying? You have heard me a great many
   times, but you never heard a sermon from me like that address from her
   dying couch! You can never quite forget it, or shake yourself free from
   its power. Beware how you trifle with it!

   To Pilate, his wife's message was God's ultimatum! He never warned him
   again and even Jesus stood silent before him. O my Friend, to you it
   may be that your child, your mother, or your affectionate wife may be
   God's last messenger, the final effort of the warning angel to bring
   you to a better mind! A loving relative pleading with tears is often
   the forlorn hope of mercy. An attack so skillfully planned and wisely
   conducted may be regarded as the last assault of love upon a stubborn
   spirit and, after this, it will be left to its own devices. The
   selection of the wife was, no doubt, made by infinite wisdom and
   tenderness, that if possible, Pilate might be stopped in his career of
   crime and strengthened to the performance of an act of justice by which
   he would have avoided the most terrible of crimes.

   So, then, we may safely conclude that the Lord has His missionaries
   where the city missionary cannot enter. He sends the little children to
   sing and pray where the preacher is never heard. He moves the godly
   woman to proclaim the Gospel by her lip and life where the Bible is not
   read. He sends a sweet girl to grow up and win a brother or a father
   where no other voice would be allowed to tell of Jesus and His love! We
   thank God it is so! It gives hope for the households of this godless
   city--it gives us hope, even, for those for whom the Sabbath bell rings
   out in vain. They will hear, they must hear these home preachers--these
   messengers who tug at their hearts! Yes, and let me add that where God
   does not em-

   ploy a dream, nor use a wife, yet He can get at men's conscience by no
   visible means but by thoughts which come unbidden and abide upon the
   soul.

   Truths long buried suddenly rise up and when the man is in the very act
   of sin he is stopped in the way, as Balaam was when the angel met him.
   How often it has happened that conscience has met a guilty man even in
   the moment when he meant to enjoy the pleasure filled with wrong, even
   as Elijah met Ahab at the gate of Naboth's vineyard! How the king
   starts back as he beholds the Prophet--he would sooner have seen the
   very devil, than Elijah! Angrily he cries, "Have you found me, O my
   enemy?" Though, indeed, Elijah was his best friend, had he known it!
   Often does conscience pounce upon a man when the sweet morsel of sin
   has just been rolled under his tongue and he is sitting down to enjoy
   it! The visitation of conscience turns the stolen honey into bitterness
   and the forbidden joy into anguish!

   Conscience often lies like a lion in a thicket--and when the sinner
   comes along the broad road it leaps upon him and, for a while, he is
   sorely put to it. The bad man is comparable to leviathan, of whom we
   read that his scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close
   seal--so that the sword of him that lays at him cannot hold, nor the
   spear, the dart, nor the javelin--and yet the Lord has a way of coming
   at him and sorely wounding him. Let us, therefore, both hope and pray
   for the very worst of men! Brothers and Sisters, use for the good of
   men anything which comes in your way! Use not only sober argument and
   sound doctrine, but even if a dream has touched your heart, do not
   hesitate to repeat it where it may have effect. Any weapon may be used
   in this war.

   See to it that you seek the souls of men, all of you! You who are wives
   should be especially stirred up to this sacred work. Remember Pilate's
   wife and think of her as affectionately giving the warning to her
   husband and go and do likewise. Never keep back from an ungodly husband
   the Word of God which may convert him from the error of his ways! And
   you, dear children, you sisters, you of the gentler sort, do not
   hesitate, in your own quiet way, to be heralds for Jesus wherever your
   lot is cast. As for us all, let us take care that we use every occasion
   for repressing sin and creating holiness. Let us warn the ungodly at
   once, for perhaps the man to whom we are sent has not yet performed the
   fatal deed. Let us stand in the gap while yet there is space for
   repentance.

   Pilate is even now sitting on the judgment seat. Time is precious. Make
   haste! Make haste, before he commits the deed of blood! Send the
   messenger to him! Stop him before the deed is done even though he
   should complain of your interference. Say to him, "Have you nothing to
   do with that just Man: for I have suffered many things because of Him
   and I pray you do nothing against Him." That is our second point. God
   bless it. Although I cannot preach upon it as I would, the Spirit of
   God can put power into it.

   III. Thirdly, we have, now, the lamentable task of observing THE
   FREQUENT FAILURE EVEN OF THE BEST MEANS. I have ventured to say that,
   humanly speaking, it was the best means of reaching Pilate's conscience
   for his wife to be led to expostulate with him. He would hear but few,
   but he would hear her. And yet even her warning was in vain. What was
   the reason? First, self-interest was involved in the matter and that is
   a powerful factor. Pilate was afraid of losing his governorship. The
   Jews would be angry if he did not obey their cruel bidding. They might
   complain to Tiberius and he would lose his lucrative position.

   Alas, such things as these are holding some of you captives to sin at
   this moment. You cannot afford to be true and right, for it would cost
   too much! You know the will of the Lord. You know what is right, but
   you renounce Christ by putting Him off and by abiding in the ways of
   sin that you may gain the wages thereof. You are afraid that to be a
   true Christian would involve the loss of a friend's goodwill, or the
   patronage of an ungodly person, or the smile of an influential
   worldling--and this you cannot afford. You count the cost and reckon
   that it is too high. You resolve to gain the world, even though you
   lose your soul! What then? You will go to Hell rich! A sorry result
   this! Do you see anything desirable in such an attainment? Oh that you
   would consider your ways and listen to the voice of wisdom!

   The next reason why his wife's appeal was ineffectual was the fact that
   Pilate was a coward. A man with legions at his back and yet afraid of a
   Jewish mob--afraid to let one poor Prisoner go whom he knew to be
   innocent--afraid because he knew his conduct would not bear inspection!
   He was, morally, a coward! Multitudes of people go to Hell because they
   have not the courage to fight their way to Heaven. "The fearful and
   unbelieving shall have their portion in the lake which burns with fire
   and brimstone, which is the second death." So says the Word of God!
   They are afraid of encountering a fool's laugh and so rush upon
   everlasting contempt! They could not bear to tear themselves away from
   old companions and excite remarks and sarcasm among ungodly wits--and
   so they keep their companions and perish with them!

   They have not the pluck to say, "No," and swim against the stream. They
   are such cowardly creatures that they will sooner be forever lost than
   face a little scorn. Yet while there was cowardice in Pilate, there was
   presumption, too. He who was afraid of man and afraid to do right, yet
   dared to incur the guilt of innocent blood! Oh, the cowardice of Pilate
   to take water and wash his hands, as if he could wash blood off with
   water! And then to say, "I am innocent of His blood"--which was a lie--
   "see you to it." By those last words he brought the blood upon himself,
   for he consigned his Prisoner to their tender mercies and they could
   not have laid a hand upon Him unless he had given them leave. Oh, the
   daring of Pilate in the sight of God to commit murder and disclaim it!

   There is a strange mingling of cowardliness and courage about many men.
   They are afraid of a man, but not afraid of the eternal God who can
   destroy both body and soul in Hell! This is why men are not saved even
   when the best of means are used, because they are presumptuous and dare
   defy the Lord! Besides this, Pilate was double-minded. He had a heart
   and a heart. He had a heart after that which was right, for he sought
   to release Jesus. But he had another heart after that which was
   gainful, for he would not run the risk of losing his post by incurring
   the displeasure of the Jews. We have plenty around us who are
   double-minded. Such are here this morning--but where were they last
   night? You will be touched by today's sermon! How will you be affected
   tomorrow by a lewd speech or a lascivious song?

   Many men run two ways. They seem earnest about their souls, but they
   are far more eager after gain or pleasure. Strange perversity of man
   that he should tear himself in two! We have heard of tyrants tying men
   to wild horses and dragging them asunder, but these people do this with
   themselves. They have too much conscience to neglect the Sabbath and to
   forego attendance at the House of Prayer--too much conscience to be
   utterly irreligious, to be honestly infidel-- and yet, at the same
   time, they have not enough conscience to keep them from being
   hypocrites! They let, "I dare not," wait upon, "I would." They want to
   do justly, but it would be too costly! They dare not run risks and yet,
   meanwhile, they run the awful risk of being driven forever from the
   Presence of God to the place where hope can never come!

   Oh that my words were shot as from a cannon! Oh that they would hurl a
   cannon-shot at indecision! Oh that I could speak like God's own thunder
   which makes the hinds to calve and breaks the rocks in pieces! Even so,
   I solemnly warn men against these desperate evils which thwart the
   efforts of mercy, so that, even when the man's own wife, with tender
   love, bids him escape from the wrath to come, he still chooses his own
   destruction!

   IV. Lastly, we have a point which is yet more terrible, THE
   OVERWHELMING CONDEMNATION OF THOSE

   WHO THUS TRANSGRESS. This Pilate was guilty beyond all excuse. He
   deliberately and of his own free will condemned the just Son of God to
   die, being informed that He was the Son of God and knowing both from
   his own examination and from his wife that He was a "just Man." Observe
   that the message which he received was most distinct. It was suggested
   by a dream, but there is nothing dreamy about it. It is as plain as
   words can be put-- "Have you nothing to do with that just Man: for I
   have suffered many things this day in a dream because of Him."

   Pilate condemned the Lord with his eyes open and that is an awful way
   of sinning. Oh, my dear Friends, am I addressing any here who are
   purposing to do some very sinful thing, but have lately received a
   warning from God? I would add one more caution! I pray you, by the
   blessed God, and by the bleeding Savior, and as you love yourself, and
   as you love her from whom the warning may have come to you, stop and
   hold your hand! Do not do this abominable thing! You know better. The
   warning is not put to you in some mysterious and obscure way, but it
   comes point blank to you in unmistakable terms. God has sent conscience
   to you and He has enlightened that conscience so that it speaks very
   plain English to you! This morning's discourse stops you on the highway
   of sin, puts its pistol to your ear and demands that you "Stand and
   deliver."

   Stir an inch and it will be at your own soul's peril. Do you hear me?
   Will you regard this Heaven-sent expostulation? Oh, that you would
   stand still, awhile, and hear what God shall speak while He bids you
   yield yourself to Christ today! It may be now or never with you, as it
   was with Pilate that day. He had the evil thing which he was about to
   do fully described to him and, therefore, if he ventured on it, his
   presumption would be great. His wife had not said, "Have nothing to do
   with that Man," but, "with that just Man," and that word rang in his
   ears--and again and again repeated itself till he repeated it, too!
   Read the 24th verse. When He was washing his wicked hands he said, "I
   am innocent of the blood of this just Person"--the very name his wife
   had given to our Lord!

   The arrows stuck in him! He could not shake them off! Like a wild
   beast, he had the javelin sticking in his side, and though he rushed
   into the forest of his sin, it was evidently still rankling in him--
   "this just Person" haunted him!

   Sometimes God makes a man see sin as sin and makes him see the
   blackness of it. And if he then perseveres in it, he becomes doubly
   guilty and pulls down upon himself a doom intolerable beyond that of
   Sodom of old. Beside that, Pilate was sinning not only after distinct
   warning--and a warning which set out the blackness of the sin--but he
   was sinning after his conscience had been touched and moved through his
   affections.

   It is a dreadful thing to sin against a mother's prayers! She stands in
   your way. She stretches out her arms--with tears she declares that she
   will block your road to Hell! Will you force your way to ruin over her
   prostrate form? She kneels! She grasps your knees! She begs you not to
   be lost! Are you so brutal as to trample on her love? Your little child
   entreats you--will you disregard her tears? Alas, she was yours, but
   death has removed her, and before she departed she entreated you to
   follow her to Heaven and she sang her little hymn--"Yes, we'll gather
   at the river." Will you fling your babe aside us though you were
   another Herod that would slay the innocents and all in order that you
   may curse yourself forever and be your own destroyer?

   It is hard for me to talk to you like this. If it is coming home to any
   of you, it will be very hard for you to hear it. Indeed, I hope it will
   be so hard that you will end it by saying, "I will yield to love which
   assails me by such tender entreaties." It will not be a piece of mere
   imagination if I conceive that at the Last Great Day, when Jesus sits
   upon the Judgment Seat, and Pilate stands there to be judged for the
   deeds done in the body, that his wife will be a swift witness against
   him to condemn him! I can imagine that at the Last Great Day there will
   be many such scenes as that, wherein those who loved us best will bring
   the most weighty evidences against us, if we are still in our sins! I
   know how it affected me as a lad when my mother, after setting before
   her children the way of salvation, said to us, "If you refuse Christ
   and perish, I cannot plead in your favor and say that you were
   ignorant. No, but I must say, Amen, to your condemnation."

   I could not bear that! Would my mother say, "Amen," to my condemnation?
   And yet, Pilate's wife, what can you do otherwise? When all must speak
   the truth, what can you say but that your husband was tenderly and
   earnestly warned by you and yet consigned the Savior to His enemies?
   Oh, my ungodly Hearers, my soul goes out after you! "Turn you, turn
   you, why will you die?" Why will you sin against the Savior? God grant
   you may not reject your own salvation, but may turn to Christ and find
   eternal redemption in Him! "Whoever believes in Him has everlasting
   life."

Pilate and Ourselves Guilty of the Savior's Death

   (No. 1648)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 5, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
   tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the
   multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just Person: see
   you to it. Then answered all thepeople, and said, His blood be on us,
   and on our children." Matthew 27:24,25.

   THE Crucifixion of Christ was the crowning sin of our race. In His
   death we shall find all the sins of mankind uniting in foul conspiracy.
   Envy and pride and hate are there, with covetousness, falsehood and
   blasphemy eager to rush on to cruelty, revenge, and murder! The devil
   awakened around the Seed of the woman the iniquities of us all--they
   compassed the Lord about, yes, they compassed Him about like bees. All
   the evils of human hearts of all ages were concentrated around the
   Cross, even as all the rivers run into the sea and as all the clouds
   empty themselves upon the earth, so did all the crimes of man gather to
   the slaying of the Son of God! It seemed as if Hell held a formal
   reception and all the various forms of sin came flocking to the
   rendezvous--army upon army they hastened to the battle!

   As the vultures hasten to the body, so came the flocks of sins to make
   the Lord their prey. By all the assembled troops of sins there was
   consummated the foulest crime which the sun has ever beheld. By wicked
   hands they did crucify and slay the Savior of the world! We have been
   singing two hymns in which we took to ourselves a share of the guilt of
   our Lord's death. We sang--

   "Oh, the sharp pangs of smarting pain My dear Redeemer bore,

   When knotty whips and rugged thorns His sacred body tore. But knotty
   whips and rugged thorns In vain do I accuse! In vain I blame the Roman
   bands And the more spiteful Jews!

   'Twas you, my sins, my cruel sins, His chief tormentors were! Each of
   my crimes became a nail, And unbelief the spear."

   And then after the same manner we sorrowfully asked a question and sang
   a penitential reply--

   "My Jesus! Who with spit vile

   Profaned Your sacred brow?

   Or whose unpitying scourge has made

   Your precious blood to flow?

   'Tis I have thus ungrateful been,

   Yet, Jesus, pity take!

   Oh, spare and pardon me, my Lord,

   For Your sweet mercy's sake!" Perhaps some of you hardly understand
   what you have been singing. But others of us have sincerely and
   intelligently pleaded guilty of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. We
   know that He not only suffered for our transgressions, but by our
   iniquities. This is not clear to a great many and I would not have them
   pretend that it is. They cannot see that they have anything to do with
   the matter of Jesus' death and, therefore, they are not moved to
   repentance by hearing of it. Indeed, they imitate the example of Pilate
   in our text when he took water and washed his hands before the
   multitude and said, "I am innocent of the blood of this just Person."

   The object of our present discourse will be to awaken slumbering
   consciences. Without going into any metaphysical questions as to
   whether such a man did or did not actually have a share in the
   particular action by which Jesus died, I shall show you that in many
   ways men practically commit a like crime and so prove that they have
   similar dispositions to those ancient Kill-Christ's! Though they
   repudiate the Crucifixion, they repeat it, if not in form, yet in
   spirit. Though

   Jesus is not here in flesh and blood, yet the cause of holiness and
   truth and His Divine Spirit are still among us and men act towards the
   Kingdom of Christ, which is set up among them, in the same way as the
   Jews and Romans acted towards the Incarnate God!

   True, all men are not, alike, against Him, for the Lord spoke of some
   who have "the greater sin," and few are as guilty as the traitor Judas,
   that son of perdition! But in every form of it the rejection of Christ
   is a great sin and it will be a great Gospel blessing if it is repented
   of after the fashion of the Prophet when he said, "They shall look upon
   Me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him as one mourns
   for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for Him, as one that is in
   bitterness for his first-born." I shall now take up the story of our
   Lord's appearance before Pilate, from the moment of His being sent back
   to Herod to the time when He was delivered to the Jews to be led away
   for Crucifixion. And I shall try to exhibit, by this narrative, several
   ways in which men virtually put the Christ to death and, therefore,
   become partakers of the ancient transgression which was committed at
   Jerusalem.

   I. First, there are some--and these are they who have the greater
   sin--who are DETERMINEDLY AND AVOWEDLY THE OPPONENTS OF THE LORD JESUS
   CHRIST. These are the men who are represented by the chief priests and
   elders of the Jews, who of old sought the Savior's blood because they
   could not endure His teaching. Nothing else would satisfy them but that
   He should be removed from the earth, for He was a standing protest
   against their evil deeds. They hated Him because by His Light their
   wicked lives were reproved. These were the true murderers of Christ,
   who gloried in their shame and defied the punishment of it, crying,
   "His blood be on us, and on our children."

   We still have among us those who cannot endure the teaching of our Lord
   Jesus. His very name seems to excite their worst passions. They rave at
   the mention of Him! Oh, the atrocious things that some have said of
   late of the Christ of God! They have gone out of their way to insult
   Him. If anyone else had been slandered as He has been, society would
   not have tolerated the loathsome tongues! Accusations against Jehovah
   and His Son would seem to be delectable morsels to modern blasphemers,
   dainties upon which they feed greedily. My flesh trembles when I think
   of the hard speeches which the ungodly still utter against Him, who, in
   the day of His humiliation, endured such contradiction of sinners
   against Himself.

   Many of these calumnies of today are absurd and to be dismissed with
   utter contempt if it were not for the guilt of the men, themselves, for
   in these speeches we see that the poison of asps is under their lips!
   Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. They do not treat so the
   heroes of war, the philosophers of antiquity, nor even the notorious
   scum of the race! To all of these they show some candor and often award
   honors which are doubtfully due--but when they touch upon the Person
   and life of our blessed Lord, candor and honesty are
   dismissed--anything like an attempt to understand Him is refused and He
   and His are treated with ridicule, misrepresentation and falsehood!
   They heap up their coarsest epithets! They put the worst interpretation
   upon His words! They give the vilest misrepresentations of His deeds
   and attribute to Him motives to which He was an utter stranger.

   Such men are among us, clamoring to be heard. There have been
   unbelievers and deriders of Jesus in all times, but just now the race
   is of fouler speech than usual. Once infidelity was philosophical and
   thoughtful--and great names were to be found upon her roll, but now her
   noisiest advocates are bullies after the manner of Tom Paine--men who
   seem to delight in wounding the feelings of the godly and crushing
   every sacred thing under their feet. These are the true followers of
   the men whose mouths were full of, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" They
   cannot endure that Jesus should be remembered, much less revered! They
   claim to be "liberal" and to be large-hearted towards all
   religions--but their unmitigated scorn of the faith of Jesus is
   displayed on every possible occasion--proving that the spirit of
   persecution burns within them.

   It would be idle for these to say that they would not crucify Christ,
   for they do crucify Him to the utmost of their power by their profane
   speeches against Him. A certain number's main attack is aimed against
   the royal authority and reigning power of the Lord Jesus. They exclaim
   against Him because He claims universal sovereignty. They might not
   object so much to Christianity as one of various creeds, but as it
   claims to be supreme, they will have nothing to do with it. The Roman
   Senate was willing to set up Jesus in the Pantheon, among other gods,
   but when they learned that Christ claimed to be worshipped, alone, then
   He was denied a place in the circle of adoration! If the Gospel claims
   to be the Truth of God and judges other systems to be false,
   straightway it arouses the opposition of the broad school! We have men
   among us today who say, "Yes, there is something good in Christianity
   just as there is in Buddhism."

   Of this precious Buddhism they seem, of late, to be wonderfully fond!
   Any idol will suit men so long as they can be rid of the living God. A
   Christ who will be everything or nothing is not to their taste. When He
   says that He will utterly demolish the idols and break His enemies in
   pieces as with a rod of iron, they give Him the cold shoulder, for they
   are distinctly the enemies of Jesus Christ if He is set forth as Lord
   of All. And we have some of milder cast, who, nevertheless, join with
   this band, for their opposition is to the Deity of Christ. These, in
   effect, cry, "We have a law, and by our law He ought to die because He
   made Himself the Son of God."

   They grow indignant over the claims which Christians advance for their
   God and Savior. Christ, the best of Men! Christ, the noblest of
   Prophets! Christ near akin to Deity, possibly a delegated God--they
   will go as far as that--but further they will not stir. "That all men
   should honor the Son even as they honor the Father" is not to their
   minds. If Jesus is preached as "very God of very God," straightway we
   hear from them the cry, "Away with Him! Away with Him!" When we
   proclaim Jesus as King upon God's holy hill of Zion and say of Him,
   "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever," they refuse to bow before
   His Divine majesty. They do, so far as they are able, destroy the
   Divinity of Christ and reduce Him to a mere man.

   How can such people blame the Jews and the Romans? They could but slay
   His manhood, but these would destroy His Deity! Is not their guilt as
   great? I charge all deniers of the Godhead of our Lord with being, as
   far as they can be, His murderers, for they strike at His noblest
   Nature by assailing His Divine power and Godhead! May the Spirit of God
   be here to convince them of their error and lead them to worship Jesus
   who is exalted at the right hand of the Father! I must charge home the
   accusation in the name of God and Truth. Avowed opposers of Christ, had
   they been alive in the days of His flesh, would have wished Him to be
   put to death, for, so far as they are concerned, He is either dead to
   them in His true Character, or else they are doing their best in their
   own conscience and upon the conscience of others to sweep Him out of
   existence!

   If they say they would not have put Jesus to a literal death on the
   Cross, I say they are putting Him to a death which He would deprecate
   even more, namely, the destruction of all His influence over the minds
   of men. By decrying His Atonement by which He reconciles men to God. By
   setting men's hearts against Him and causing them to refuse His
   salvation, these men, as far as they can, rob Him of the joy that was
   set before Him, for which He endured the Cross, despising the shame! Is
   this nothing? Put me to death if you will, for I shall live when I am
   dead by the words which I have spoken! I should count it a far worse
   murder if you could sweep out of men's minds all that I have taught and
   overthrow all the good which I have attempted to do. And if it is so of
   a mere man, much more must it be so of Jesus--that merely to murder Him
   upon the Cross is comparatively little compared with declaring--"We
   will not be influenced by Him, nor believe in Him as Savior and God.
   And to the best of our power we will prevent others from believing in
   Him."

   What a wretched objective for a man to live for! What a horrible fame
   for a man to seek after--to stamp out the Gospel of Jesus! Terrible
   will be the punishment of this sin! Oh, opponent of Jesus, instead of
   being less guilty than the Jews of our Lord's day, you are even more
   culpable! You are not slaying Him in one way, but you are doing it in
   another, and the crime is the same in spirit! I see a mystic Cross to
   which your cruel words nail my Lord! I see before my mental eyes a
   Calvary whereon the Lord Jesus is crucified afresh and put to an open
   shame by infidel sarcasms and skeptical insinuations! I see Him derided
   and made nothing of by those who deny His Deity and refuse to believe
   in His Sacrifice!

   Enough of this! May conscience be present here and the Spirit of God be
   present, too, that men may not dare to wash their hands in innocence if
   they have been the open antagonists of Jesus and still are so! Oh that
   you would turn to Him and become His disciples! His beauties are such
   that they might well charm every honest heart! His teaching is so
   tenderly reasonable, so full of sweetness and of light, that it is
   marvelous that men do not receive it with joy! His Cross is unique--a
   bleeding sufferer bearing offenses that were not His own--that His own
   enemies might live! The conception is so strange that it could never
   have originated in the selfish mind of fallen man. It bears its own
   witness on its brow. Woe unto those that fight against it, for it shall
   cost them dearly. He that stumbles upon this Stone shall be broken, but
   upon whomever this Stone shall fall, it shall grind him to powder!

   See what came to these Jewish people--they were, themselves, crucified
   by Titus in such numbers that they could no longer find wood enough for
   their execution! Jerusalem destroyed is the result of Jesus Crucified!
   Beware, you that fight against Him, for the Omnipotent Father will take
   up His quarrel and all the forces of Creation and of Providence will be
   at His command to wage war for Truth and righteousness! The Nazarene
   has triumphed and He will triumph even to the end when He shall have
   all His enemies under His feet! O you that hate Him, be wise and close
   the hopeless contest in which you chiefly fight against your own souls!

   II. I hope there are not many here to whom this first part of my sermon
   applies. We will advance to a second point. Pilate, having a conscience
   which troubled him, was exceedingly anxious not to put Jesus to death
   and yet could not see how he could avoid doing so, seeing that the Jews
   threatened to accuse him of lack of loyalty to Caesar and that Caesar,
   the gloomy tyrant Tiberius, was unrelenting in his fury. After first
   sending his Prisoner to Herod, he finds that he cannot escape in that
   way and, therefore, he grasps at a second hope. He tells the mob that
   the custom of the feast required that one prisoner should be released
   and that the choice remained with them. He hopes that they will choose
   Jesus of Nazareth. A vain hope, indeed!

   It so happened that there was another Jesus in prison at the time,
   namely, Jesus Barabbas, who had been a murderer and was guilty both of
   sedition and robbery. Pilate brings out the two and he gives the Jews
   their choice. It would make a wonderful picture if it were really so,
   as a writer on the Life of Christ suggests, that Pilate actually set
   the two individuals before the crowd. See there the dark-browed,
   scowling assassin, with fierce looks and every mark of fury and hate

   upon his face! The man was taken red-handed, familiar with blood, the
   brigand whose very profession was strife! There he stands like a
   wolf--and by his side is set the gentle Lamb of God. See there in His
   face all that is good, tender, benevolent, heroic.

   The incarnations of hate and love are before them--and Pilate gives the
   crowd their choice. Without hesitation they cry, "Not this Man, but
   Barabbas." "Now Barabbas was a robber." The murderer walks away free
   and the innocent Jesus is left to die! In this I shall have to impeach
   a second class of men IN THE MATTER OF THEIR CHOICE. Many among us
   have, by Divine Grace, chosen Jesus to be our Savior, King and Lord. He
   is the groundwork of our eternal hope and the spring of our present
   joy--we have selected Christ to be the Guide and Leader of our
   lives--and we are not ashamed of the choice! It has been made
   deliberately and solemnly and we renew it from day to day--

   "High Heaven that heard the solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily
   hear, Till in life's latest hour we bow, And bless in death a bond so
   dear." I fear that some among you have not chosen Christ. But what have
   you chosen? Let me mention two or three objects of human choice, worthy
   to be ranked with Barabbas of old. Too many have chosen lust to be
   their delight--I will not paint the hideous monster--I have no colors.
   It is a foul and bestial thing! The cheek of Modesty blushes at the
   very mention of it! Yet, for the pleasures of wantonness, Christ is set
   aside. For the strange woman, many a man has thrown away his soul and
   chosen infamy instead of Glory! I half excuse the Jews for choosing
   Barabbas when I see a man obeying the lusts of the flesh instead of
   Christ--and yet I am probably addressing individuals who secretly
   indulge their baser passions and are, thereby, held back from becoming
   decided Christians. They know they cannot be followers of Christ and
   yet indulge in wantonness and chambering and, therefore, for this vile
   self-indulgence they let Jesus go.

   Very frequently I meet with persons who have chosen another Barabbas
   instead of Jesus. What if, to borrow from heathenism, I call it
   Bacchus? Drink is the demon which enthralls millions! It is a vice
   which degrades men and defaces the image of God in them. We insult the
   brutes when we say that a drunken man sinks to the level of the beasts,
   for the cattle never go so low as that! Alas, I have known men--yes,
   and women, too--who have been hearers of the Gospel and have, in a
   measure, felt its power--and yet for this sin they have sold their
   souls and given up their Savior! No drunk has eternal life abiding in
   him and, to speak plain English, there are professing Christians who
   deserve to be called by that name!

   I say that they prefer the drink-demon to the holy Lord Jesus! You
   condemn the Jews for choosing Barabbas? Where will you find a counselor
   to plead for you when you choose drunkenness? If it was sinful for them
   to choose a murderer, what must it be for you to choose this cursed
   vice which murders its hundreds of thousands? Oh, this national vice of
   ours is the vice which makes this nation a byword and a proverb among
   the nations of the earth! What shall I say of it? And is this to be set
   in rivalry with my Lord? Oh, shame, cruel shame that this should be
   selected in preference to Him who loved us and gave Himself for us!

   "Well, well," says one, "I do not fall into that sin." No, my Friend,
   but what is it that you do choose instead of Christ, for if you do not
   set Him on the throne of your heart, you are choosing something else!
   Is it that you do not want to be a Christian because you wish to save
   yourself trouble and would be happy and comfortable and enjoy yourself?
   You do not choose any openly vicious way in particular, but you prefer
   to be moderately sinful and to take care of yourself and save all care,
   thought and anxiety about death and Heaven and Hell. You think that by
   leading a careless life you are happier than if you yielded yourself to
   Jesus? You are laboring under a mistake and one thing is clear--self is
   your god--and that is an idol as groveling as any other! The idolater
   who worships a god of gold or silver, or even of stone or mud, is not
   quite so degraded as the man who worships himself! Self-worship is
   coming very low, indeed.

   When I am my own god, or my belly is my god, can there be a lower
   depth? If I live merely to be easy and comfortable and have no care for
   God, or Christ, or heavenly things--what a choice I am making! Think of
   it and be ashamed! Oh, I say again, in many a man's choice of what
   should be the object of his life, he sins precisely as they sinned who
   put away Jesus and chose Barabbas! I say no more. May the Holy Spirit
   send home this sadly convicting truth.

   III. Thirdly. Pilate, seeing that he cannot, thus, set his Prisoner
   free, gives Him over into the hands of the soldiers, who straightway
   make merry over Him and treat Him as an object of contempt. The words
   are cruel and are enough to draw tears from all eyes as we read
   them--"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him. And the
   soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and they
   put on Him a purple robe."

   "I am innocent here," cries one of my Hearers. What? Are you quite sure
   that you are free from THE SIN OF CONTEMPT AND OF CAUSING PAIN TO
   JESUS? Listen a while. When you have been so busy about the world that
   you

   could not think of Him. When you have been so eager to be rich that you
   laughed at the true riches, do you not know that you were twisting a
   crown of thorns to put upon His head? Your folly in despising your own
   soul sorely wounds Him! He pities you and cannot bear to see that the
   thorns of this world should be the harvest which you sow and reap. If
   He were not so loving of heart and tender of spirit it would not
   matter, but this unkindness to yourself is unkindness to

   Him! And virtually when you have been full of cares and anxieties
   concerning the world and have had no care and no anxiety about Him or
   about your own soul, you have put a crown of thorns upon His head!

   Is this nothing? Let me ask you, when you have gone up to the place of
   worship on Sunday, as you always do, and have pretended to adore Him,
   though you do not love Him--do you know what you have done? You have
   mocked Him by a feigned worship and thus you have put the purple robe
   upon Him! That purple robe meant that they made Him a nominal king, a
   king who was not, in truth, a king, but a mere show. Your Sunday
   religion, which has been forgotten in the week, has been a scepter of
   reed, a powerless ensign, a mere sham! You have mocked and insulted Him
   even in your hymns and prayers, for your religion is a pretense with no
   heart in it! You brought Him an adoration that was no adoration, a
   confession that was no confession and a prayer that was no prayer! Is
   it not so?

   I pray you be honest with yourselves. Is it not so? And then all the
   week long have you not preferred anyone to Jesus? Any book to the
   Bible? Any exercise to prayer? Any enjoyment to communion with Him?
   Political objects have awakened you, but not the Lord's Glory nor the
   spread of His Kingdom! Is not this despising Jesus? Is not this mocking
   Him? Are there not among you some who are weary of the Lord? Weary of
   the Sabbath? Weary of sermons about Jesus? Weary of atoning blood?
   Weary of praising the Redeemer? What is this but contempt of Him? Too
   many have even jested about the holiest of things--if they have not
   mocked Jesus, personally, they have ridiculed His people for His sake
   and made mirth of His Gospel!

   By some, religion is set up as a scarecrow, and piety is treated as a
   byword! Conscientious scruples are laughed at as old-fashioned
   absurdities and devotion to Christ is set down as next of kin to
   insanity! We know it is so, even among some who are hearers of the
   Gospel and outwardly its upholders. There is contempt for the life and
   power of it--they know and honor its name--but the reality of vital
   godliness they do not value. At times their conscience thunders heavily
   at them and then they are compelled to wish they had what, at other
   times, they disdain! They do despite to the blood of Jesus and yet
   would gladly be partakers in its pardoning power.

   I fear none of us dare wash our hands of this as a sin of our fallen
   estate! Time was when those of us who love Jesus and could kiss every
   wound of His, yet thought so little of Him that anything was better
   than He. The story of His sufferings was as wearisome as a worn-out
   tale and as for giving our whole selves to Him, we deemed it a
   fanatical expression or an enthusiastic dream! Blessed Savior, You have
   forgiven us! Forgive others who are doing the same!

   IV. I have but a minute to spare for each point, so now I mast turn to
   another sin of which many are guilty, namely,

   THE SIN OF HEARTLESSNESS WITH REGARD TO THE SUFFERINGS OF OUR LORD.
   Pilate thought he had

   another way of letting his Prisoner go, and this he tried. He scourged
   Him! I will not tell you how dreadful Roman scourging was. It could
   not, now, be equaled except, perhaps, by the Russian executioner. It
   was the most terrible of tortures. Many died under it and almost all
   the victims fainted after a few blows. By it the human frame was
   reduced to a mass of bruised, bleeding, quivering flesh. When the
   Savior was all a mass of wounds and bruises, Pilate brought Him forth
   and said, "Behold the Man," appealing to what little humanity he hoped
   there still might be in the chief priests and elders. "Behold the Man!"
   he said.

   "Is not this enough? He is crashed and battered and bleeding all
   over--is not this enough?" But they had no feeling for Him, whatever,
   and only cried, "Away with Him." If the spectacle of woe which our Lord
   presented on this occasion does not touch you, it is a lamentable proof
   of hardness of heart! Do not many read the story of His sufferings
   without emotion? Despised, reviled, crowned with thorns and scourged,
   our Lord stands alone as the Man of Sorrows, the Monarch of Miseries!
   Griefs without parallel! Woes unique and by themselves! Have you no
   tears to shed for Him whom soldiers mocked and Jews derided? No? Is it
   possible that you answer, "No"? Have you heard the story till it has
   less effect than an idle romance? For shame! For shame!

   And the worst of it is that it should not affect men when they remember
   that these griefs were voluntarily borne out of love--not of necessity
   nor from any selfish motive! His woes were borne for His enemies! He
   bade His disciples begin to preach at Jerusalem that the men who spat
   in His face might know that they had a share in His compassion--and
   that he who drove the lance into His heart was one for whom He tasted
   death! He dies praying for His murderers! Ah me! That it should be so.
   A man dying for his friend is a noble sight. But a Man dying for those
   who put him to death is the most extraordinary sight that angels ever
   beheld! There is this about it, too, which touches Believers most
   tenderly--our Lord suffered thus on our account. In His death is our
   hope, or else we are lost forever. If we have not part and lot in the
   merits of the agony, then for us there remains nothing but a fearful
   looking for judgment and of fiery indignation!

   Do we not mourn when we see Jesus dying for us? O Feeling, you are fled
   to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason! Surely our hearts
   will be like the rock in Horeb! Stricken by the rod of the Cross, our
   souls will gush with rivers of penitential grief! And here is a
   marvelous proof of our guilt--that we have compassion for everybody but
   the Savior! That we can cry over a lapdog and yet can hear of Christ
   with utter indifference! There are multitudes of persons of this kind
   and I pray God's Spirit to touch their conscience upon this matter of
   heartlessness toward Jesus. But I must hasten on, though I might wish
   to linger, leaving with meditations the enlargement of these charges.

   V. There is another crime of which many are guilty which was see in
   Pilate and that was the crime of COWARDICE. No less than three times
   did Pilate say of our Lord, "I find no fault in Him," and yet he did
   not let Him go. He himself said, "I have power to crucify You and have
   power to release You," and yet he dared not exercise the power to
   deliver. Through cowardice he dared not let his perfectly innocent
   Prisoner go free. He knew, but he did not act up to his knowledge. Have
   I any before me whose knowledge of good things far outruns their
   practice? This, surely, will be one of the never-dying worms of
   Hell--the gnawing of an instructed and disregarded conscience! Over the
   door of their prison, the lost shall read this inscription--"You knew
   your duty but you did it not." The knowledge which makes men
   responsible for their deeds increases that responsibility as it is,
   itself, increased--and with it their guilt and their punishment!

   Moreover, Pilate did not only know the right, but after his own fashion
   he wished to do it. One almost pities the vacillating coward! See how
   he struggles to release Jesus in some indirect fashion which may cost
   him nothing. He wishes. He resolves. And then he hangs back. Like a
   vessel tossed with contrary winds, he is, at one time, almost in
   harbor. But soon he is far out at sea! Oh, the quantities of dead
   wishes that one might gather in this Tabernacle, as men gather untimely
   fruit which the wind has shaken from the trees! Men wish to repent,
   wish to believe, wish to decide, wish to be holy, wish to be right with
   God--but their wishing leads to no practical decision--and so they
   perish at the threshold of mercy! Their goodness ends in empty desires
   which do but evidence their responsibility and so secure their
   condemnation!

   Yet, to be just, we must admit that Pilate did more than wish. He spoke
   for Christ. But having spoken in His favor he did not proceed to
   action, as be was bound to have done. It is possible for a man to say
   with his tongue, "I find no fault in Him," and then by his actions to
   condemn Jesus by giving Him up to die. Words are a poor homage to the
   Savior. Not by words does He save mankind and not by lip service is He
   to be repaid! Pilate spoke boldly enough and then retreated before the
   clamors of the crowd--and yet sometimes Pilate could be firm. When
   Jesus was nailed to the Cross, the priests begged Pilate to change the
   accusation which was written over His head, but he would not, but
   replied, "What I have written, I have written."

   Why could he not have shown a little backbone when Jesus yet lived? He
   was not altogether such a weak, effeminate being as to be incapable of
   putting his foot down firmly. If he did so once, he might have done it
   before and so have saved himself from this great transgression. Are
   there any Pilates here--persons who would long ago have been Christians
   if they had possessed enough moral courage? Some foolish companion
   would laugh at them if they became religious and this they could not
   bear. Poor cowards! I heard the other day of a lad who dared not pray
   in the room where two or three others slept and so, like a coward, he
   crept into bed and succumbed to the fear of others. I fear that some
   men would sooner be damned than be laughed at!

   Another person has a wicked companion and he knows that he must cut his
   acquaintance if he becomes a follower of Jesus--this he would do, but
   he lacks courage! O you who shrink back from that which Christ's
   service involves because of the fear of men, know you not the portion
   of the fearful? O you trembling ones, is Jesus covered with wounds and
   shame for you and are you ashamed of Him? Death is coming upon Him,
   speedily, and do you hide your faces from Him? This is cruelty, indeed,
   both to Christ and to yourself! Can you not leave His enemies? "Come
   you out from among them, and be you separate: touch not the unclean
   thing." Will you not espouse His cause? "If any man will serve Me, let
   him follow Me." By this cowardice you do as much as you are able to put
   the Christ to death!

   "How?" you ask. Well, suppose everybody acted as you do? Would there be
   any Christianity in the world? If everybody was cowardly, would there
   be a Church at all? Are you not killing Christ and burying Christ as
   far as you can? Are you not destroying His influence and weakening His
   Church by refusing to acknowledge Him? Is it not so? Look at it. What
   influence you have in the world, you refuse to use for Jesus. Though
   multitudes are active in despising and opposing Him, you do not lift a
   hand in His favor. Why do you not come out and say, "I am on His side"?
   By your supposed neutrality you act as His foe! You must be on one side
   or the other--now that you have heard the Gospel--for Jesus has said,
   "He that is not with Me is against Me: he that gathers not with Me
   scatters abroad." You are against Him and you are scattering abroad!

   Suppose others follow your example? "Well," you say, "there is nothing
   bad in my example, except that I am not a Christian." Just so, and
   under some aspects the very goodness of your example makes it operate
   all the more powerfully for evil! I do not think that the example of a
   thoroughly drunken man, for instance, leads many young people into
   intemperance. On the contrary, many take warning from the spectacle and
   fly to total abstinence for security. I have often had young men and
   women coming to join the Church who have been total abstainers of the
   most intense kind because a drunken father made their childhood so
   wretched and kept the home so poor that they abhorred the accursed
   thing! See, then, how an evil example may lose its evil power by very
   excess.

   Yours is another case--your example is, in some respects,
   admirable--but then you throw it on the side of the devil. The better
   man you are, the more mischief you are doing by siding with evil!
   Inasmuch as you are that which is moral, excellent, amiable, you are
   the very man whose influence Christ ought to have on His side--and if
   you cause it to go

   against Him, the fact is all the more deplorable! If the weight of your
   character goes to make men ignore the claims of the Son of God, what is
   this but spiritually to compass His death?

   VI. Lastly, and oh that the Spirit of God may bless this sharp medicine
   to some heart that it may feel the pangs of penitence this
   morning--there is the sin of SELF-RIGHTEOUS HYPOCRISY. This Pilate
   committed in set form. He took water and washed his hands and said, "I
   am innocent of the blood of this just Person: see you to it." What a
   contradiction! He is innocent, but he gives them permission to be
   guilty! They could not murder the Lord without his permission. He gives
   the necessary permit and yet he says, "I am innocent." Do I not see
   another of the same class over yonder? He says, "I do not despise
   Christ, or speak a word against Him. I am perfectly innocent of any ill
   will towards Him. Of course, if others oppose Him they may, for it is a
   free country--let them do as they like, but I am perfectly clear of
   it."

   It is not the way that a man acts if he sees another being murdered! He
   does not look on and say that he would rather not interfere. You say
   you cannot help other people's opinions? Have you no opinion of Jesus
   of your own? Do you say, "No. I never think of Him"? Is not that
   contempt? Do you decline to hold any opinion about one who claims to be
   your God? About one who must be your Savior or you must perish forever?
   You cannot sheer off in that way! Now that rebellion is afoot, you must
   either be loyal or be a traitor! The standard is unfurled and each man
   must take his side. Your negligence of Jesus contradicts your claim to
   be neutral. You pretend to leave Him alone, but that leaving alone is
   fatal!

   A man is in yon upper room of a burning house and you can save him. I
   use this illustration, for it is no concern of yours either way, and so
   you leave it to the firemen and their helpers. Meanwhile, the man
   perishes because you will not help him. I say that you are
   inexcusable--that man's blood lies at your door. It was your duty to
   have rescued him. So the Lord Jesus Christ comes here among men and He
   is persecuted. You quietly say, "No doubt it is a pity, but I cannot
   help it." Just so. But by your inaction you side with His foes! Do you
   say that you are so righteous that you do not need a Savior? That,
   indeed, is smiting Him on the face!

   He comes to be a Savior and you tell Him that He is superfluous? That
   you are so good that you can do without being washed in His blood? That
   is spitting in His face and telling Him that He was a fool to die for
   you! Why should He shed His blood if you are innocent enough without
   it? In effect you charge God with folly for providing a great
   Propitiation when such good people as you are need nothing of the kind!
   I do not believe anybody can more grossly insult the Son of the
   Highest! This is crucifying Him, indeed! The self-righteous man who
   says, "I am clean," deprives Christ's Sacrifice of its Glory, His life
   of its end, His Person of its dignity, His whole work of its wisdom!
   The very heart of God is set upon the objective for which Christ died
   and yet the self-righteous man counts this a folly!

   Come, my Hearers, there is no room for any of us to accuse his
   fellow--let us all come with humble confessions to the feet of Jesus,
   now risen from the dead--and let us each say to Him right sorrowfully--

   "'Tis I to whom these pains belong, 'Tis I should suffer for my wrong.
   Bound hand and foot in heavy chains Your scourge, Your fetters,
   whatever You bear, 'tis my soul should bear, For she has wel deserved
   such pains. Yet you do even for my sake On you, in love, the burdens
   take That weighed my spirit to the ground! Yes You are made a curse for
   me That I might yet be blest through Thee: My healing in Your wounds is
   found."

Freshness

   (No. 1649)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 16, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand." Job
   29:20.

   "I shall be anointed with fresh oil." Psalm 92:10.

   THE first text tells us of the renown of Job and of the way in which
   the Providence of God continued to maintain the glory of his estate,
   his bodily health and his prosperity. He was for many days, months,
   years, continuously prospered of God. Everything to which he set his
   hand succeeded. God had set a hedge about him and all that he had, so
   that none broke through to molest him. He grew richer, he grew more
   influential, he had more honor in the sight of his fellow men each
   morning that he walked to the gate. In every way he was advanced from
   day to day and that throughout a long stretch of years. His glory was
   fresh in him. He did not achieve a hasty fame and then suddenly become
   forgotten. He did not blaze out like a meteor and then vanish into
   darkness, but he seemed to be continually fresh, vigorous, strong,
   energetic and successful.

   He says that his bow was renewed in his hand, whereas a bow usually
   loses its force by use and is less able to shoot arrows after a little
   while and needs to lie still with a slack string--but it was by no
   means so with Job. He could send one arrow and then another and then
   another--and the bow seemed to gather strength by use! That is to say,
   he never seemed to be worn out in mind or body. Whatever he commenced
   was commenced with as great a freshness and zest as the last thing
   which he had accomplished and that had been commenced with the same
   energy as the first enterprise of his youth. However, this did not
   always last, for Job, in this chapter, is telling us of something that
   used to be--something that, the loss of, he very sorrowfully
   deplored--"my glory was fresh in me." He found himself suddenly
   stripped of riches and of honor and put last in the list instead of
   first, while his purposes and aims seemed all to miss their way--and he
   had no strength and no glory left in him. Now he had reached the winter
   of his discontent and those who, before, did him homage, became his
   assailants. So far as glory was concerned, he was forgotten as a dead
   man out of mind.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, this gives us a lesson that we must not put
   our trust in the stability of earthly things. It is said of the world
   that God has founded it upon the floods. How, then, can we expect it to
   be substantial? Beneath yon moon, continually changing, what can we
   discover that abides the same? Where the very light of Heaven is waxing
   and waning, what is there but mutability? Change is written upon the
   face of all things. If, then, you have built your nest on high, reckon
   not too surely that you shall die in your nest--for the axe may fell
   the tree and bring it down at an untimely date. If your children are
   round about you in good health, be not too sure of them, for they may
   be carried to an early grave--and the parent may yet be childless.

   If up to now you have been great in the esteem of men, think less than
   nothing of that, for the breath of popular applause is more fleeting
   than a vapor! It scarcely comes before it goes, and they who,
   yesterday, cried, "Hosanna," in the streets at your coming, may, before
   tomorrow's sun is set, be crying, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" They did
   that to the Master--marvel not if they do it to the servants! This is
   the respect that makes all mortal things inconsiderable to a wise
   man--he scarcely will put them among his treasures--for they melt
   before they are fairly counted, like a coinage of ice. They are but as
   the counters that a child plays with, having only an imaginary value.
   The things which are seen are shadows--the things invisible are the
   only substances. Reckon, then, at their fit price, this transient glory
   of wealth, health, or fame. Lay up treasure, "where neither moth nor
   rust does corrupt," and seek for stability in other things than these.
   Get the feet of yours joy upon the Rock of Ages and reckon all else to
   be but sand at its very best.

   David, in the second text is talking, I think, about spiritual things,
   and he tells us with great joy that he should be anointed with fresh
   oil. He did not expect that his glory would depart, but he expected
   that it should be renewed. He did not reckon that the bow would lose
   its force in his hand, but that God would increase his strength from
   day to day. And if any of you, here, who are God's people have any
   fears about the future as to your soul matters--if you are alarmed with
   the fear that you will share the same lot which Job shared as to his
   temporal glory--I would remind you that Job, even in temporals,
   received at last twice as much as he had in his best. We must remember
   that God can turn His hand one way as well as another and brighten your
   prospects as well as darken them! Predict delight rather than despair.
   Even the lower springs shall continue to flow till you are beyond the
   need of them!

   Just now it is about spiritual matters that I want to speak--and if you
   have a fear that you must necessarily decline in these--I would remind
   you of the words of David, "I shall be anointed with fresh oil" and,
   yet further on, of his other words, "They shall still bring forth fruit
   in old age, to show that the Lord is upright." Never fall into the
   notion that a spiritual falling off is inevitable--there need be
   nothing of the kind--you may be fresh as the dew even unto the end! The
   subject, tonight, will run in this way--First, the excellency of
   freshness--"My glory was fresh in me." Secondly, the fear of
   ill-departure. And, thirdly, the hope of is continuance, which hope is
   greatly encouraged by the words of our text--"I shall be anointed with
   fresh oil."

   I. First, then, notice THE EXCELLENCY OF FRESHNESS. "I shall be
   anointed with fresh oil." David had been anointed, while still a youth,
   to be king over Israel. He was anointed, yet again, when he came to the
   kingdom. That outward anointing with actual oil was the testimony of
   God's choice and the emblem of David's authorization. Oftentimes, when
   his throne seemed precarious, God confirmed him in it and subdued the
   people under him. When his dominion became weak, God strengthened him
   and his servants and gave them great victories, so that, as a king,
   David was frequently anointed with fresh oil. David's royal brow was
   crowned with fresh laurels again and again and his throne was settled
   and established by the hands of the Lord.

   It was established, not with the same old stale anointing--a repetition
   of that which had lost its force--but with oil freshly pressed from the
   green olive, namely, with a new blessing and a fresh blessing from
   God's right hand, as I trust, you and I may be! Freshness is a most
   delightful thing if you see it in another. It is a charm in Nature. The
   other day, when the wind blew cold, someone said to me, "Yes, but how
   fresh the air is and how refreshing--how different from that heavy,
   muggy atmosphere in which we were half drowned and almost entirely
   suffocated but a few days ago." We need something fresh, and when we
   get it, we are freshened ourselves! How pleasant to go into the garden
   and see the spring flowers just peeping up. How agreeable to mark the
   rills, with their fresh water leaping down the hills after showers of
   rain. The young lambs in the meadows and larks in the sky are
   delightful because of their freshness. Everything that is fresh seems
   to have a charm about it to our minds.

   But, dear Friends, spiritual freshness has a double charm! Sometimes we
   know what it is to have a freshness of soul, which is the dew from the
   Lord. You remember when first your flesh was as that of a new-born
   child? I mean when you were newly born again and first knew the Lord.
   How fresh everything was to you! The pardon of sin--how it sparkled!
   The righteousness of Christ--how brilliant! The idea of being a child
   of God--how novel and how delightful! To be joint-heir with Christ--how
   it almost startled you--it was such a new idea to your spirit! And
   oftentimes since then, when your soul has been in a lively condition,
   everything has been bright, charming, exhilarating--nothing flat,
   stale, unprofitable.

   Even though you heard the same things said again and again, yet,
   because your soul was fresh, they came to you with unusual power. Your
   spiritual food, if you are healthy, is always fresh to you, like the
   manna in the wilderness which was never stored a single night except
   for the Sabbath--but fresh and fresh it fell--and Israel gathered it
   and fed upon it then and there. Oh, it is a blessed thing to have your
   soul in a fresh state, filled with the ever-flowing Living Water! It is
   glorious to find everything about you fresh and new through the
   teaching of the blessed Spirit, so that you go from strength to
   strength and, like a roe or a young hart, leap from hill to hill! If we
   are now in the possession of it, may we always keep that freshness of
   soul and never lose it.

   How that freshness is seen in a man's devotions. Oh, I have heard some
   prayers that are really musty! I have heard them so often that I dread
   the old familiar sounds! Some hackneyed expressions I remember hearing
   when I was a boy. I even now hear the vain repetitions--old, worn-out,
   good-for-nothing rubbish expressions they were then--but they are

   still brought out by regular prayer-makers! Even where the words are
   new and original, you will hear men pray in such a style as to make you
   say to yourself, "That prayer came out of Noah's Ark." As far as that
   man is concerned, there is nothing at all in it of life, sap, or savor.
   It has been dead long ago and hung up to dry till not a particle of
   juice remains in it.

   But, on the other hand, you hear a man pray who does pray--whose soul
   is fully in communion with God--and what life and freshness is there!
   It may be that his expressions are somewhat rough, but they touch you
   because they come from his heart. Some of the confessions and petitions
   are strange to you, perhaps, and yet you feel that they are such
   strangers as it behooves you to be joyous at once! You are glad that
   such words and thoughts have passed through your spirit and blessed
   you! You feel that you can pray with such persons. Their prayers will
   go to Heaven, for they came from Heaven! God has inspired them and
   their originality is a part of the manual of the Spirit. I like to hear
   a Brother even stop and stammer because he cannot go on--his heart is
   too full and he cannot find words. Oh, but it is blessed to get a
   little freshness, even if it comes through a breakdown!

   I suppose that those dear Friends who pray by the book of Common
   Prayer, somehow or other manage to put freshness into their prayers. I
   am always glad that they do, for it shows the vigor of their piety. As
   for me, I am such a poor, weak thing, that after I have repeated the
   same words about half-a-dozen times, they do me no good. I must use
   words that suit the time and suit the state of my heart--and suit my
   desires and suit my depressions or my joys--and suit my thankful or
   mournful heart! One seems to need in prayer something fresh, but when
   the prayer is old and worn--and seems to have been brushed and turned
   and very little made of it, after all--why, then it does not strike us,
   or impress us, or help us! I like to feel freshness even in singing a
   hymn. It may be that we know the words, but then we must put fresh
   heart into them and feel them over again as much as if we were the
   authors of them! Then they become a grand vehicle for our praises! How
   sweet to sing, as it were, a new song! It is a blessed thing to have a
   freshness about our devotions, be they private or public, exultant or
   repentant.

   And so, dear Friends, it is well to have a freshness about our
   feelings. I know that we do not hope to be saved by our
   feelings--neither do we put feeling side by side with faith--yet I
   should be very sorry to be trusting and yet never feeling. Surely it
   would be a dead faith! It would be a strange thing to be a living child
   of God and to have no feelings. I will tell you about feelings as they
   strike me. Sometimes I have deplored the condition of my heart before
   God and thought my feelings to be the worst that could be. But what a
   foolish judge I have been, for in a week's time I have needed to have
   those despised feelings over, again, and thought that now, at last, I
   had fallen into a worse state than before. I am persuaded that we are
   very poor judges of the value of our own inward feelings, and, perhaps,
   when we are lowest in our own esteem we are really highest in the sight
   of God.

   And when we feel as if we did not pray, we are praying, and the heart
   may be wrestling with God more when it fears that it does not pray than
   when you come down complacently out of yours closet and say, "I know
   that I have had a good time, for I feel perfectly self-satisfied." I
   long for the Truth of God in the inward parts and wisdom in the secret
   places of the soul. Anything is good which rids us of pretense! Oh to
   be broken into splinters by the hand of God! And for every grain of
   dust to cry out to Him! I believe this mode of praying often prospers
   beyond any other. At any rate, give me not stereotyped pretension to
   feeling, but fresh feeling. Whether it is joy or sorrow, let it be
   living feeling, fresh from the deep fountains of the heart! Whether it
   is exultation or depression, let it be true and not superficial or
   simulated! I hate the excitement which needs to be pumped up. There is
   a something delightful, to my mind, in coming to the Throne of Grace,
   weeping--a something delightful in coming to the Lord's Supper full of
   joy and gladness--to come to either place cold and dead is horrible!
   There is something delicious in knowing that what you feel is true and
   comes up from the very bottom of your soul. That it has a point and
   edge about it which proves how sincere it is. God keep us from stale
   feelings and may He give us freshness of emotion!

   I believe, dear Friends, that there is a very great beauty and
   excellence in freshness of utterance. Do not hinder yourself from that.
   How I long for it as a preacher! When one has, day after day, to stand
   before the same assembly and to talk of the things of God, one dreads
   lest he should be so monotonous and full of repetition that even the
   things of God should come to be a weariness to God's own people! I have
   often thought that if some Brothers who are very careful to speak
   exceedingly well what they say, should be a little more careless and
   speak as it comes--letting their heart flow over

   at their lips spontaneously--then there would be a far greater
   freshness about their utterance than there is when every sentence
   smells of the lamp and reeks of midnight oil!

   God forbid that we should say a word against the deep study and the
   profound research of God's Word, but still, we may get to be so much
   students that we scarcely speak like practical men who live among the
   people! By aiming at a very superior style, we may fall into a
   thoroughly inferior one and all our freshness may be gone. I like, for
   my part, the wild bird's note. Men get the bullfinch and teach it to
   sing a few notes--and then the piping bullfinch is greatly prized. But
   I have finches outside my window, any one of which will beat any finch
   in the world that only pipes a note or two, for they pipe much more
   melodiously, though they were never taught except by God and Nature!
   There is a range of sweetness about their wild notes that a tutored
   bird cannot reach. Nature, pure and unsophisticated, is the best
   instrument for Divine Grace.

   I like to hear men speak of God as they have known Him, every man in
   his own order, and with his own voice. Coming fresh, perhaps, from the
   very haunts of sin, out of which free Grace has fetched them, let them
   speak like Israelites fresh from the brick kilns! Coming from the
   plow-tail or from the forge with all the equipment of their trade about
   them and speaking just as they are. Without pretending to be anything
   else than they are and telling of God's amazing love to them--not
   quoting the experience of others, but giving out their own--this will
   be their wisdom and strength! Oh, there is a freshness about that and a
   great power to catch the ear and to move the heart when God, the Holy
   Spirit, is present to bless it!

   Now, you that have lately been converted, do not go and learn all the
   pretty phrases that we are accustomed to use. Do not go and sit down at
   the feet of your dear teacher in the class and feel that you must talk
   just like he. Strike out your own course. Be yourself! "But I would be
   odd," you say. All right--so is your pastor! You need not mind that.
   You will not be the only odd body about. Be encouraged by that! I think
   that a little of what people call oddness is just, after all, leaving
   God's work alone. All the trees that God makes are odd. The Dutchmen
   clip them round or make them into peacocks, but that style of gardening
   is not to our mind.

   But some people say, "What a lovely tree!" I say, "What a horribly ugly
   thing it is." Why not let the tree grow as God would have it? Do not
   clip yourselves round or square, but keep your freshness! There will be
   no two Christians exactly alike if they do that. There should be a
   freshness, dear Friends, about our labor. We ought to serve the Lord,
   today, with just as much novelty in it as there was 10 years ago. I may
   even venture to say 30 years ago! Oh, I remember the seriousness with
   which I went out to preach the first half-dozen sermons I ever
   preached--and what a burden it was from the Lord! And how I did go at
   it with all my might? Very clumsily, but still with all my soul and
   spirit!

   And do you remember when you began to teach the class, or began to take
   your tract district? Did you not pray over it? It seemed almost too
   good to be true that you should be trusted with doing anything for your
   Lord and Master! And you did it, oh, so intensely and, therefore, you
   had God's blessing! You did it well, though you blundered a good deal,
   for all your heart was in it, your motive was pure and your faith was
   childlike. You blundered the right way, for you blundered with your
   heart and so blundered into other men's hearts! Your heart was serving
   God, even in the mistakes you made.

   And now, perhaps, you can go round the district and you are pretty well
   half-asleep over it. And you can teach the class, but there is not the
   vigor, the force, the energy, the intense desire, the burden that there
   once was--perhaps not all the joy. You can stand up and preach, dear
   Brother, and you have got pretty well accustomed to it--and the people
   have got accustomed to it, too--and they can nearly go to sleep! And
   you can, too--preach asleep! It is an easy thing to do, if you once
   learn the wretched art. There is a kind of sleep-walking in
   preachers--they can talk in their sleep in a very precise way--much
   more wonderful than walking! You cannot say, "I sleep, but my heart
   wakes." The fact is that it is the other way around--"I wake, but my
   heart sleeps"--and it is a great pity when it comes to be so.

   We should pray to God that we may do everything fresh, just as if we
   had never done it before, only doing it with all the improvements which
   experience will bring to us! Pray with your children, tonight, as if it
   were your first prayer with them! Speak with them about their souls as
   if you had never mentioned the subject before. Talk of Jesus as if you
   were telling new news! Why, aren't you? Is it not always glad tidings?
   Always news fresh from Heaven? May God grant us Grace that, when we
   come to be gray and when we totter with our staff for very age--we may
   still tell out the story, if

   with feebleness of utterance, yet with juvenility of heart--feeling
   that we are bringing forth fruit even to old age, for the Lord still
   anoints us with fresh oil!

   So much for the beauty and excellence of freshness. It ought to run
   into everything.

   II. Now, dear Friends, in the second place, I will dwell upon the fear
   of losing it--THE FEAR OF ITS DEPARTURE. I have heard some express the
   thought that perhaps the things of God might lose their freshness to us
   by our familiarity with them. I think that the very reverse will turn
   out to be the case if the familiarity is that of a sanctified heart. In
   other things, "familiarity breeds contempt," but in the things of God,
   familiarity breeds adoration. The man who does not read his Bible much
   is the man who has a scant esteem of it. But he that studies it both
   day and night is the very man who will be impressed by its infinitude
   of meaning till he will be ready to cry, like Jerome, "I adore the
   infinity of Scripture."

   I know that he that prays most loves prayer most and he that is most
   occupied with the praises of God is the very person who wishes that he
   could praise God day and night without ceasing. These things grow on
   you. Hence I would have no man fear that familiarity with holy things
   can take away from their freshness and their beauty! You may drink at
   other wells till you are no longer thirsty, but, strange to say, this
   all thirst-quenching water, nevertheless, produces a much deeper thirst
   after its own self. He that eats of the Bread of Heaven shall hunger
   for no other, but shall grow ravenous for it. His capacity for feeding
   upon it shall be increased by that which he has fed upon. And, whereas
   at first, the crumbs from under the table might have satisfied him when
   he knew himself to be but a dog, at last, when he knows himself to be a
   child of God, he wishes for everything that is set upon the table!--

   "Less than Yourself will not suffice My comfort to restore."

   He must have all that is to be had! Such is his desire. Dismiss, then,
   any fear from your minds about that.

   When we first commenced to break bread on every first day of the week,
   I heard some say that they thought that the coming so often to the
   Table might take away the impressiveness of the holy feast. Well, I
   have scarcely ever missed a Sabbath, now, these 20 years, and I never
   was so impressed with the solemnity and the sweetness of the Master's
   Supper as I am now! I feel it to be fresher every time. When it was
   once a month, I had not half the enjoyment in it, and I think that
   where friends have the communion once a quarter, or once a year, as in
   some Churches, they really do not give the ordinance a fair opportunity
   to edify them. They do not fairly test the value of an ordinance which
   they so grossly neglect, as it seems to me. No, you may have more, and
   more, and more, and more of everything that Christ has instituted and
   ordained, especially more and more of Himself--and the more you have,
   the more freshness there will be!

   "Yes, but we have had a fear, sometimes, that there will be a lack of
   freshness about ourselves." Well, that fear is a very natural one. Let
   me tell you some points on which, I fear, we have good ground of alarm,
   for we do our best to rob ourselves of all life and freshness.
   Christian people can lose the freshness of themselves by imitating one
   another. By adopting as our model some one form of the Christian life
   other than that which is embodied in the Person of our Lord, we shall
   soon manufacture a set of paste gems, but the diamond flash and glory
   will be unknown. Many godly people have a very deep sense of their
   corruption and inward sin and this, together with sorrowful spirit,
   combines to make them a rather gloomy race. Often deeply taught in
   other respects, they fail to rejoice in the Lord.

   Certain of these have formed a school and they have set up a standard
   and judge everybody to be a deceiver or a mere babe in Grace who cannot
   groan as deep down as they can. This is not wise. If you do that, you
   will lose your freshness, for you will forever be scattering your dust
   and ashes over all the joys of your life. Why should the children of
   the bride-chamber mourn while the Bridegroom is with them? Let us be
   happy while we may! There is another set of Brethren who are always
   glad and happy, for they are healthy and competently provided for. They
   think they are out of the way of temptation and so they believe that
   they are perfect--they also set up a standard and cut down everybody
   who cannot sing right up into the alto notes as high as they can! Well,
   you will get stale, too, Brothers and Sisters, whoever you may be, for
   self-laudation never keeps fresh long!

   When we have heard about half-a-dozen brethren boasting that they are
   nearly perfect, it is about as much as some of us can stomach! I cannot
   stand above two of them without feeling my boxing propensities set in
   motion! Poor fools, how have they persuaded themselves to hope that
   self-praise will be thought to be the height of piety? It is nauseous,
   even, to those of us who are prepared to make a measure of excuse for
   the fervid imaginations of the brethren! Drop into one par-

   ticular groove and run in it--take up one line of things and stick to
   it--and you will very soon find yourself as far from freshness as a bit
   of leather which has been worked on an engine to revolve forever and
   ever in the same course! The beauty of real life lies much in its
   variety.

   A Brother comes to me on Sunday morning sighing. Thank you, Brother,
   for that! I am glad that you are in that state, for that is where I am!
   And we can sympathize with each other. Perhaps tomorrow I meet this
   same friend and he is full of joy and delight, and I say, "Thank you,
   Brother, I am glad to meet with somebody who is rejoicing in the Lord.
   You give me a lift. Now shall I be helped to rejoice in Him, too."
   Sometimes, in this pilgrimage to the Celestial City, I join company
   with a Brother worker who laments that he has many difficulties in
   dealing with poor sinners. I say to him, "I am glad of that, for I have
   more difficulties than you, but I see that I am not alone in my
   anxieties." Another I meet with says that he has been so happy in
   meeting with souls that have found the Lord and I reply, "Yes, and I am
   glad to see you, for I am happy, too, for I have met with many who have
   just found the Savior."

   These changes and ups and downs are like the delicious variations of
   the seasons--they are not always autumn, not always spring, not always
   winter, not always, even, the plenitude of summer. So with our souls,
   we are never so long in one place as to find monotony in life. No, the
   monotony is in death--the freshness is in life! These changes and
   varieties create a splendid freshness which we might not hope to have
   if we tied ourselves to one man's chariot and resolved that our
   experience should be uniformly like his. Another way of spoiling your
   freshness is by repression. The feebler sort of Christians dare not
   say, feel, or do, until they have asked their leader's permission. I
   have known a little village chapel in which, when the preacher had
   delivered a sermon, the people did not know whether he was sound or not
   till they had asked the principal deacon! Or they waited till they got
   outside and consulted a little knot of good old men and women who had
   to act as tasters for all the others and give a verdict as to the
   orthodoxy of the performance! A few good souls thought the sermon to be
   very sweet--the man seemed to be preaching the Gospel--but they did not
   like to commit themselves to the tune till they had got the key note.
   And when they had seen the Brother that led them all, then they knew!
   If he said that it was all right, why, then it was all right!

   Now, dear Friend, if you feel that God is blessing you in any religious
   exercise, mind that you are blessed and let other people who do not
   like to be blessed go without it if they must. But as for you, be
   blessed when you can! Do not be ashamed to enjoy that which others
   despise. Sit down and quietly feast on the kernel while others are
   breaking their teeth over the shells. If you feel that you must sing,
   sing without stint! Why not? In the kitchen--in the parlor--sing! Never
   mind if remarks are made. Do not worldlings sing to their own
   liking--why shouldn't you? If sometimes you feel that you cannot sing,
   well, then, do not sing! Be yourself and be natural as Divine Grace
   makes you natural--that is the thing. Let your mind have freedom and do
   not feel as if you went about in fetters, bound to this and pledged to
   that!

   In the living kingdom of the living God there is no rule that you groan
   at eight o'clock in the morning and sing at noon; that you sigh at
   half-past three and get the plenitude of the Spirit at a quarter past
   seven! Nothing of the kind! It is a free Spirit under whose power we
   dwell and He comes like the wind and goes like the wind--and acts
   according to His own pleasure. Lord, uphold me with "Your free Spirit."
   Do not repress Him. "Quench not the Spirit." Yield yourselves to His
   influences and if you feel inclined to shout, be brave enough to do
   so--and give the praise to God! This is a successful way of keeping up
   freshness--to be rid of repression and to be free before God.

   If we want to keep up our freshness, however, the main thing is never
   to fall into neglect about our souls. Do you know what state the man is
   generally in when you are charmed by his freshness? Is he not in fine
   health? Some of my dear friends were known to call and see me when I
   was laid up some time ago--and I am afraid that they did not find much
   freshness about me, then! On the contrary, they heard much the same old
   story--weary nights and painful days. I hope I did not display much
   impatience, but still, the tendency is to give a good deal of telling
   of what one has to endure! There is not much freshness about that.

   But a man is fresh, generally, when he is well and everything is going
   right within his internal economy. Then he thinks fresh thoughts and
   uses fresh words, for all around him life is in its flowery age and
   sparkles like the morning! I am sure that it is so with the soul. When
   the soul is healthy--when you are feeding on the Bread of Heaven; when
   you are living near to God; when you are believing the promises and
   embracing them; when you are getting into the very sunlight of the
   Lord's fellowship--oh, it is then that fresh words and striking words
   not often heard will drop from you!

   Pearls will fall from your lips if those lips have been with Jesus, and
   He has kissed you with the kisses of His mouth! Do not neglect
   yourself, then! Let the fountain of the heart be right and then the
   freshness will speedily be seen.

   I have shown you the things by which a man may lose his
   freshness--avoid them carefully. Those of you who are workers for God
   may have a fear that you will lose the freshness of yours utterances--a
   fear which haunts a good many of us. Now, that may happen to us by our
   own fault if there is a need of searching the Word of God; if there is
   a need of fresh acquisitions of sacred knowledge. And it may happen to
   us, again, if we are always gathering the thoughts of others and do not
   think, ourselves. Then we shall lose freshness and become mere dealers
   in second-hand observations. Many thoughtful Brothers and Sisters are
   afraid that they may lose it through age. It does happen to men, as
   they grow old, that much of the vivacity of youth departs. And we all
   know ministers who have lost much of their power to edify because their
   freshness and variety have gone. It is a sad thing that it should have
   to be so with any of us, but what a blessed thing it is if we can fall
   back upon that assurance, "I shall be anointed with fresh oil."

   Nature decays, but Grace shall thrive. The Holy Spirit will renew our
   youth. The Grace of God can give us freshness after Nature has ceased
   to yield it. And it shall be a better freshness--not the dew of our
   youth, but the dew of the Spirit of the Lord! If Jesus Christ is
   preached, age becomes an important help in bearing testimony to His
   faithfulness and power to bless. I can imagine it to be the duty of the
   aged minister to retire from the prominent sphere where he has long
   been the preacher--and I hope in my own case I shall not occupy this
   pulpit an hour too long! But the man of God can find another
   pulpit--and when he has found it, I can suppose him often beginning his
   youth, again, as he tells out the story of the Cross and talks of
   Jesus--and proclaims the Doctrines of Grace again! He can begin in his
   country sphere much in the same way as he set out at the first. At any
   rate, he has always this to fall back upon," I shall be anointed with
   fresh oil." The Holy Spirit will abide with him continually and give
   him an anointing of freshness.

   And so with you, dear Friends. You think, when you have done addressing
   the class, "Well, I am pretty well spun out. I shall never be able to
   get another address." Shall you not? Read that-- "I shall be anointed
   with fresh oil." And you that go out preaching in the villages and
   often cry, "I do not know what I shall do for a sermon next Sunday,"
   think of this and be consoled--"I shall be anointed with fresh oil."
   Fall back on that! If you are called to speak to the same people for
   any length of time, it will make the promise all the more dear to you,
   as you can plead it before God, "Lord, anoint Your servant with fresh
   oil." I pray that all of us in heart, soul, life, utterance and labor
   may always be kept fresh and may God grant that we do not backslide,
   for that would kill our freshness and put in the place of its sweet
   smell the foul odors of sin!

   Oh to be holy, sweet and vigorous to the end! The Lord grant that we
   may make large drafts upon Himself for greater faith, greater love, and
   greater joy--then shall we have greater freshness! May we also be
   sustained from within by His blessed Spirit and so may our freshness
   continue to our dying day.

   III. I close with the third point, which is this precious Word of God
   which gives us HOPE OF ITS RENEWAL. Let us not think that we must grow
   stale and heavenly things grow old with us, for, first, our God in whom
   we trust renews the face of the year. He is beginning His work, again,
   in the fair processes of Nature. The dreary winter has passed away. The
   time of the singing of birds is coming on and the sweet flowers are
   peeping out from their graves, enjoying a resurrection of' glory and
   beauty.

   Now, this is the God whom we serve, and if we have been passing through
   our wintertime, let us look for our spring. If any of you have been
   growing cold of late--if any of you have grown stale and mechanical and
   have fallen into ruts-- come, look up! Look up and pray the great
   Renewer to visit you--

   "Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, With all Your quickening powers."
   "He restores my soul: He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His
   name's sake." It will not take the Lord long to restore you. "His word
   runs very swiftly." He speaks even to ice and frost and by His word
   they pass away. He has but to will it and all the genial days of spring
   and summer come hastening on and the banner of harvest is waving.
   "Awake you that sleeps and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give
   you light." Be hopeful! Be joyful! There are better days for you. Put
   your trust in God, who renews the face of the earth, and look for His
   Spirit to revive you.

   Moreover, there is an excellent reason why you may expect to have all
   your freshness coming back--it is because Christ dwells in you! Do you
   not know it? Christ is formed in you the hope of Glory and, if so, your
   glory will be fresh

   about you, for He never grows stale. It is God that said of Him, "You
   have the dew of Your youth." Oh, the doctrine of the indwelling of
   Christ in the Believer--let us never forget it! As long as that is a
   Truth of God, there is always a hope for us. Then there is the other
   grand doctrine of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He dwells in you!
   If your bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, shall He not always
   be to you a fountain of new life--a spring of fresh delights? Why, it
   must be so! The Holy Spirit is not exhausted. His power is not lessened
   in any degree whatever. He can make your face shine, again, and your
   tongue sing again! He can make your heart leap, again, with unspeakable
   joy!

   Come, you that sit in the dust, begin to rejoice, for God the Spirit is
   still with you and shall be with you--the Comforter whom Christ has
   given--never to be taken away! Rejoice in Him and ask Him, now, in His
   mercy, to restore your soul, and He will do it! Oh, what a blessing it
   is to get right deep down into God's Word, for that Word is always new
   and the source of new thoughts in those who feed upon it! This is the
   Book of yesterday, today and forever--the Book which, though many of
   its verses were written thousands of years ago, is as new as though it
   were only written yesterday! From the mouth of God come the promises,
   at this moment, full of life and freshness and power! Come to it! It is
   all yours--every acre of this blessed land of Canaan is yours and will
   yield you corn and wine and oil!

   There is not a star in the great firmament of Scripture but shines for
   you! There is not a text in all this mighty treasury of God but you may
   take it and spend it and live upon the produce! Therefore, while the
   Word of the Lord is so fresh and so full, it cannot be that you shall
   be stale in thought and conversation. You shall be anointed with fresh
   oil! God Himself is with you and He is always full! God Himself is with
   you and He is always living! God Himself is with you and He is always
   fresh--and He shall refresh your spirit! Why stay away? Come from all
   that is stale and flat and from all the dead past--and enter into
   eternal life where flowers forever bloom, fruits forever ripen--and the
   fresh springs forever flow!

   Come and eat the new corn of the land and drink the new wine of the
   kingdom! And may the Lord make you glad in His House of Prayer for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

God's Fatherly Pity

   (No. 1650)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH 2, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that fear
   Him." Psalm 103:13.

   IN the former part of this Psalm, the Psalmist sang of God's deeds of
   love, His gifts, His benefits and His acts of kindness. But here he
   goes deeper into the Divine motive and, therefore, he finds sweeter
   incentives to devout gratitude. There is a fullness of consolation in
   the fact that the heart of God is towards His people. He not only
   dispenses blessings--so does the sun, so do the clouds, so do the
   fruitful fields--but He takes a warm interest in our welfare and has a
   feeling towards us of kindly, gentle affection. And that of such
   intensity that one of the highest forms of earthly love is here used as
   a figure to set forth the tender mercy of our God towards us. I have
   always been taught as an axiom in theology that God has no griefs--that
   He is "without parts or passions"--I think was the definition. But I
   have often inwardly objected to such statements. They seemed to me so
   inconsistent with the tone and tenor of Scripture, for He appears to
   take pleasure in His people and to be "grieved" with their ill manners.

   Surely, metaphors that are Inspired must have a meaning that is
   instructive! If the Father's "heart yearns." If our Lord and Savior is
   "moved with compassion." And if the Holy Spirit is "vexed," there must
   be something analogous to what we call emotion, among ourselves, in the
   acknowledged attributes of the Most High! At least He appears to
   sympathize with us, so that "in all our afflictions He is afflicted,"
   and He pities us, "as a father pities his children." "That is speaking
   after the manner of men," somebody says. True. And it is exactly the
   way I do speak. In no other way do I know how to speak! And until I
   learn to speak after the manner of angels, you must pardon me and
   accept an apology--not only for my own ignorance of any other tongue
   than that in which I was born--but also for the incapacity of my
   hearers to understand any other than human language.

   Neither do I know anything, so limited is my intelligence, except after
   the manner of men. It seems to me that if there is any other manner or
   means of communicating thoughts and emotions, it must belong to some
   other being than man. And if it is correct to speak after the manner of
   men, then be it understood I do speak after that manner, and I am
   perfectly satisfied that I am able so to speak the truth as shall give
   a faithful and adequate impression to your minds. There is a feeling
   which has a measure of pain in it, familiarly known to us as, "pity."
   It is a love which so sympathizes with its objects that, in a manner,
   it makes itself one with them--and if it should involve suffering, pity
   shares the pang. If there is any kind of grief in the one that is
   pitied, he that pities becomes a partaker of that grief.

   I believe in a God who can feel. As to Baal and the gods of the
   heathen, they may be passionless and without emotion, or without
   anything that is akin to feeling. Not so do I find Jehovah to be
   described. How did His anger kindle when He gave His people over to the
   sword and was angry with His inheritance! And how transporting is His
   love to the daughter of Zion when He rejoices over her with joy! He has
   a pity, yes, and a sorrow, too, according to this Book. I dismiss,
   therefore, the theology of the schoolmen--I am quite satisfied with the
   Divinity that I find in these Scriptures! Believe it then, dear
   Friends, with all your hearts, that God has kindly feelings towards
   them that fear Him, such as a father has towards his children!

   This is a Truth of God of which I feel jealous and I do not wish to see
   it toned down. There is a sentiment abroad that sounds plausible and is
   accepted by many Christian people, that God puts us to much sorrow,
   wisely and for our good, while His own heart is unaffected or callous
   to our suffering because He foresees, according to His own purpose, the
   good that will come out of it. Some kind of analogy might, in that
   case, be suggested between our gracious God and a skillful surgeon, who
   cuts and cuts deeply, when he would remove a cancer from the flesh. Or
   a physician who administers potent drafts of medicine, which, perhaps,
   cause excruciating pain. The surgeon would be too intent on the success
   of his opera-

   tion, or the physician would watch with too much anxiety, the effect of
   his prescription on the patient to bestow much thought or sympathy on
   those present sufferings which he confidently anticipates will effect a
   permanent cure.

   So he calmly looks on, intent upon the result in the future, as he
   ignores, to some extent, the anguish of the passing hour. But I pray
   you not to think that it is exactly so with God. Of course, in a higher
   scale, He has all the wisdom of the physician and He views our
   afflictions that we now endure in the light of that hereafter when He
   will heal all our diseases, give unto us beauty for ashes, the oil of
   joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
   Still, He does not steel His heart to the immediate and the present
   trouble of His people, but, "As a father pities his children, so the
   Lord pities them that fear Him."

   I can understand the surgeon looking at the patient, while causing him
   acute pain under the operation, with the bravery of a man whose nerves
   cannot easily be shaken. But the father must leave the room! He cannot
   bear it. The mother cannot look on--they are carried away with the
   immediate grief. And so it is with God, albeit that the splendor of His
   wisdom and His foreknowledge enable Him to see the end as well as the
   beginning, yet, believe me, like as a father is pitying his children,
   so the Lord is pitying them that fear Him! For it is in the present
   tense and carries the idea of con-tinuity--at this very moment He is
   pitying them that fear Him! Though He knows your trials will work for
   your good, yet He pities you! Though He knows that there is sin in you,
   which, perhaps, may require this rough discipline before you are
   sanctified, yet He pities you!

   Though He can hear the music of Heaven--the songs and glees that will
   ultimately come of your present sighs and grief--yet He still pities
   those groans and wails of yours, for, "He does not afflict willingly
   nor grieve the children of men." In all our distresses and present
   grief, He takes His share. He pities us as a father pities his
   children. Let us look at the text, then, believing in its meaning and
   not frittering it away by saying, "That is after the manner of men."
   For again, I say, there is no other manner in which we can speak and no
   other manner in which God, Himself, can speak if He means us to
   understand Him.

   There is, doubtless, some high and vast meaning which, like the
   covering cherub, stands high over all, but, for all that, I am but a
   child and cannot reach it. I am content with what I can reach;
   satisfied with what is obviously the meaning of this text, "As a father
   pities his children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him." Hear it,
   dear Friends, first, for your encouragement, and hear it, next, for
   your imitation. Hear it that you may be encouraged! God is not
   unfeelingly afflicting you, but He is pitying you! Hear it that you may
   be impelled to go into the world with a like pitying eye. If you ever
   have to say a rough word in fidelity, or are required to utter a stern
   rebuke, do it after the manner of your heavenly Father, pitying even if
   you have to blame, and gently delivering the expostulation which it
   grieves you to have to deliver at all!

   I am not, tonight, able to preach to you much by way of set discourse,
   for I am one of those children, just now, who needs his Father's pity!
   I half think He would have bade me go home and not speak to you at all,
   had it not been that the sight of this assembly stirs my spirit and
   makes it imperative that when you come together to hear, I should have
   something to say to you--therefore, as best I can, I shall simply call
   attention to some things in our condition and our circumstances which
   make us resemble children towards whom God has pity. Will you please
   observe, on the outset, that the pity of the Lord extends to all those
   that fear Him. There are none of them that are not fit objects of His
   compassion-- the very best and brightest of His saints, the brave
   heroes, the well-instructed fathers, the diligent workers--God pities
   you, my dear Brothers and Sisters! Will you take that home to
   yourselves because there is a beautiful lesson of humility in so
   accounting ourselves as pitiable creatures in the eyes of the
   Lord--even when we are at our best estate.

   I have seen some Brothers and Sisters that really did not seem at all
   good subjects for pity because they imagined that the very roots of sin
   had been eradicated out of their hearts. Their character and their
   conduct were akin to perfection in their own esteem. I forget how many
   weeks they had lived without a sin except they had some wandering
   thoughts, once or twice--but they could hardly remember or refer to
   that as a fault! Yes, but I venture to say I pity people that talk so!
   If they are God's children, all that God does with them is pity them
   and well He may, for He says to Himself, "Poor dear creatures! How
   little they know of themselves and how different their estimate of
   perfection is from Mine!" He still pities them, but that is as far that
   He goes. I do not find Him admiring them or exalting and extolling
   them. The biggest child He has, the child that is most like His Father
   and has learned most of Jesus, may come to this text and see himself
   depicted in it, "As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities
   them that fear Him."

   As for us who are not so big and are still among His little children, I
   am sure the Lord, first, pities our childish ignorance. He is not angry
   with us because we do not know everything. He is not angry with us
   because the little we do know we mostly turn topsy-turvy, upside down.
   He is not angry with us because what He has taught us we are very apt
   to forget by reason of our fickle memory. No--He pities us!
   Schoolmasters of the olden type used to think that the boys must do all
   the lessons that were given them and learn everything that was
   contained in their school books. Then they asked them questions which,
   if the pupils could answer, there would be no need for any teachers.
   But if the boys did not know the answers, there was nothing for them
   but a fierce word and a hard blow!

   That is not how fathers teach--true fathers--but when their children do
   not know, they tell them. If they cannot quite understand them, they
   watch their faces and they put the thing into another shape. And if the
   child has not got it then, they try again and, at last, they find the
   keyhole of the child's understanding and put the key in! And
   straightway the mind is opened and the truth, like a precious treasure,
   is stowed therein! A father does not act like a schoolmaster, but he
   pities his children and he is willing, patiently, to teach them. Does
   the father expect his child to know as much as himself? Does the
   politician expect the little boy to understand the secrets of the
   Cabinet? Does the tradesman expect his child to come into his shop and
   perceive the intricacies of his business? Certainly not!

   And when the child makes many mistakes, at which others laugh and mock
   and make some bitter jest till the tears rise in his tender eyes and
   roll down his little cheeks, the father feels the affront and pities
   his child. He, too, smiles at the strange things--the freaks of the
   child's mind--yet there is not an atom of scorn in that smile! He loves
   him too much to ever think of him in that way and he goes on to teach
   him more. "Why did you tell your child that piece of information 20
   times?" asks one. "Why," said the mother, "I told him 20 times because
   when I had told him 19 times he did not know it--so I went on to 20
   times." And that is how God does with us! He has taught, some of us, 19
   times and we do not know it--so He will teach us 20 times, for He
   pities us.

   Oh, if He were to treat us as some lads have been treated at
   schools--where they dismiss a boy as incorrigible, too dull, too stupid
   ever to shine--some of us would have been turned away long ago! But He
   takes us, dull scholars as we are, and He tires not of teaching, as He
   gently insinuates one Truth after another--not too much at a time--for
   He says, "You cannot bear them now, though I have many things to say
   unto you." And so by degrees He does get a little into us. Blessed be
   His name for that little! It is worth all the world! One thing 1 know,
   whereas I was blind, now I see! I have got that drilled into me. To
   know Him and to know something of the power of His Resurrection, and
   something of conformity to His death--these are lessons we are going on
   to learn with a sweet prospect of being taught yet more and more! And
   we need never fear of being dismissed because of our dullness, for, "As
   a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him."

   Let us take a word of admonition from this instance of pity before we
   go any further. Do not let us think that we have not the privileges of
   children because we do not know as much as more experienced saints, or
   because we cannot engage in the devotion at Prayer Meetings, or conduct
   a Bible class, or, perhaps, can hardly understand the creed of the
   Church well enough to give a clear account of it! Do not let us think
   our heavenly Father does not love us; that He will refrain from keeping
   His eyes upon us, or cease to watch our growth in Grace and in the
   knowledge of Christ until He shall have more fully instructed us. Do
   not let us begin to condemn those of God's children that do not know as
   much as we do. We have not got far ourselves.

   Still, there is a tendency in some to say, "Why, this cannot be genuine
   Grace, for it is accompanied with such little knowledge." Well, now, if
   that suspicion shall lead you to give more instruction, it is well! But
   if it shall lead you to set aside the uninstructed one, it is evil. In
   the Church of God it behooves us to have the same pity on the ignorant
   as our heavenly Father has shown towards us in our ignorance--and we
   ought to have even more, seeing He has no ignorance of His own and we
   have much! Let us, therefore, be very compassionate and exceedingly
   pitiful towards those of our Brothers and Sisters who as yet know but
   little.

   Another thing in which our heavenly Father shows Himself pitiful to us
   is in our weakness. Children cannot do much; they have but little
   strength, especially little children too young, too helpless to run
   alone. The mother does not despise--she rather dotes on the babe whose
   little body is a burden she has to carry because it cannot walk. Her
   heart is not hardened against her infant because the wee baby is unable
   to help itself! Our heavenly Father knows our weaknesses! Some of you
   know something of your own lack of strength. You are bowed down under a
   sense of your infirmity tonight.

   Now, do not let your weakness lead you into any unbelief or mistrust of
   God. He knows our frame--He remembers that we are but dust. An infant's
   incapacity never excites a parent's ire. You, being evil, know how to
   be tender with your offspring--how much more shall the Father of
   Spirits sympathize with such weakness as He knows we are all prone to
   experience!

   Possibly the weakness that distracts you comes from languor of body. I
   have been, sometimes, so sorely sick as scarcely able to pray, that is
   to say, not to express my desires in a consecutive prayer. And I
   remember one who said to me, "I appeal to you, as a father, were your
   child suffering from a fever, his mind wandering and his speech
   delirious, would you reproach him because he did not address you just
   as he has been accustomed to do when he was in health?" I felt I should
   have rather commiserated his sickness than complained of his frenzy.
   Neither will our heavenly Father deviate from the instincts that He has
   implanted in the nature of His creatures! He has revealed to us as an
   illustration of His own emotions toward those that fear Him!

   If you who have been accustomed to guide your class in their studies,
   cannot find anything instructive to teach them. Or if you are a
   minister and it should seem to you that the tide runs out when you
   looked for your thoughts to flow freely--and that the words fall frozen
   when you hoped they would fire volleys from your lips--there may be
   some rational solution for your languor. If there is any wrong in your
   heart or in your habits, you may well blame yourselves! But if it is
   pure weakness--whether it comes from the body or from the mind that you
   are weary, disorganized, depressed and bowed down--do not think of
   aggravating your distress by self-reproach, but hear the text say, "As
   a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him.
   For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust."

   Some of our Brethren seem to think we are made of cast iron. They would
   have us preach all day and all night long. At times they are so
   thoughtless as to make use of very bitter language when some servant of
   Christ cannot, through physical or mental weakness, do all they want of
   him. "So-and-So does it," they say. A man in perfect health and
   strength may joyfully accomplish what another man cannot even think of
   undertaking. So are God's servants misjudged by the sterner sort. But
   they are not misjudged by God, for He pities the weakness of His people
   and blames them not! I wish I could speak a word that would be
   encouraging to any here that would go about Christ's service if they
   could, but cannot.

   I remember John Bunyan's little picture of the man that is sent for the
   doctor and he has to go on a horse. He has to go as quickly as he can,
   but the horse is a sorry jade and cannot go very fast. "Oh," he says,
   "look at the man, how he kicks, how he tugs at the bridle and his
   Master knows he would go if the horse would only carry him." Under such
   circumstances the messenger could not, surely, be to blame! So
   sometimes God sees the efforts of His servants to work for Him. Why,
   they would drive the Church before them and pull the world behind them
   if they could! And if they do not seem to be able to do it, does He
   blame them? No, verily, but He pities the weakness of them that fear
   Him! We will go a step further now. In children there is something much
   worse than ignorance and weakness--and that is their childish follies.
   There are some persons who have a great affection for children and find
   great pleasure in being with them by the days together.

   I confess I find a larger portion of pleasure when they are out of the
   way. Perhaps it is because I need quiet and stillness that I am better
   able to bear with them a little at a time. But there are persons who
   seem to take a delight in all their childish pranks and game, and all
   their romps and frolic. Well, that is good, and I hope you will have
   plenty of it, you that like it. But the father is the one who can bear
   with his children when other people cannot. I have occasionally been in
   houses where I have felt that I was glad the father could bear with
   them, for I did not feel inclined to be very patient with their play,
   myself, however proper I may think it for young people to be lively!
   And you know a father and mother will put up with a thousand little
   things in their children that strangers would frown at.

   Those dear, kind mothers, with a little tribe about them--they do not
   seem wearied and worn out! And if anybody says, "Oh, look what he is
   doing." "Ah, well," says the mother, "he is only a boy." "Oh, but see
   that girl." "Oh, well, she is so young, she must have her little
   frolics." There are all sorts of excuses made on their behalf and it is
   right enough that it should be so. It is not weakness in the child, it
   is just childishness. And when we were children, we did the same, and
   others bore with us--and so parents bear with their children. But oh,
   how God our Father bears with us! We think we are very wise--it is
   highly probable that we are never such fools as when we think we are
   displaying our wisdom! We think we are pleasing God, sometimes, and in
   that very act we are displeasing Him, though we know it not! There are

   sins in our holy things--oh, how strange must some of the things that
   we do seem to our great God! We have gotten so accustomed to them! We
   have seen them in others. We have come to put up with them in others
   and others put up with them in us!

   Now, we who talk, sometimes, about our doubts and fears, why, there
   must be much in them that must be very depressing to the mind of the
   great Father. Do we doubt Him? Do we distrust His promises? We try to
   make out that we do not, but if you sift it thoroughly, it does come to
   that! Oh, the Father knows that we do not mean it; that we shrink in a
   moment from the idea of making Him to be a liar! And if anybody else
   were to put forward the very doubt which we have been entertaining, we
   should be horrified with it! And I believe it is a great part of our
   heavenly Father's pity that He should thus look on us and often
   construe what we do in such a kind and tender way. You know how Jesus
   prayed for His murderers--"Father, forgive them, for they know not what
   they do." And the Son is very like the Father--our Father does the same
   with us--He forgives us because we "know not what we do."

   It was very beautiful of our Lord, even with Pilate, to say, "He that
   delivered Me unto you has the greater sin." It was the best He could
   say for Pilate, that though his sin was great, yet there was a greater.
   And our Father has all those kind thoughts ready, we may be sure, for
   His children's wild and wayward deeds. Jesus had them ready, even, for
   His most fierce and wicked adversaries. Yes, He pities our follies and
   still bears with us! But children have something worse than
   follies--they have faults to be forgiven. Now, our Father pities the
   faults of His children and He shows His pity by this fact--that He has
   provided for their cleansing and He freely gives them the use of that
   provision--and readily forgives them their iniquities.

   A good child, when it has done wrong, is never satisfied until it gets
   to the father and says so, and asks the father's forgiveness. Some
   fathers, perhaps, think it wise to withhold the forgiving word for a
   little time and so may our great Father. But as a rule is it not
   wonderful how readily He forgives? He does, for a little time, perhaps,
   make us smart under the sin, for our good, but it is not often. As a
   rule, the kiss is on our cheek almost before the confession has left
   our lips! Oh, have we not gone to Him and we have thought, "He will
   chasten me for this. I may expect to be put in the dark and to be
   without communion with Him for many days." But we have just ingenuously
   opened up our heart and told Him that we grieved--and asked Him to make
   us even more grieved that we might hate the fault--and never fall into
   it again. And almost at once He has said, "I have blotted out your sins
   like a cloud, and like a thick cloud your iniquities; go and sin no
   more."

   Do you not think that Peter ought to have been thrown out of the Church
   a good long while after denying his Master with oaths and cursing?
   Well, perhaps he would have if we had been consulted in the matter, but
   when Jesus Christ was here on earth, by a kind look or a gentle word He
   could set very crooked things straight! So we see Peter in company with
   John and the rest of the Brothers within two or three days of his
   committing that serious trespass. The Lord is very ready to forgive--it
   is the Church that is unmerciful, sometimes, but not the Master--He is
   always willing to receive us when we come to Him and to blot out our
   transgression. Come along, then, you that have erred and gone astray,
   you backsliders that are sensible of sin--you, His children that did
   walk in the light but a few days ago, and have got into the dark by
   some sad slip--come along!

   You are very ready to forgive your children, are you not? Do you not
   remember, you that are too old to have them about the house, how
   readily, in your younger days, you picked up your little ones in your
   arms and said--"Dear Child, do not cry any more, you must not do it
   again, but father fully forgives you this time"? Just so does your
   heavenly Father wait to pick you up and to press you to His bosom and
   say, "I have loved you with an everlasting love." Not, "with a love
   that can soon be set aside by your fault." "I have loved you with an
   everlasting love, therefore, I will blot out, again, your
   transgression--and set your feet on a rock and strengthen you to sin no
   more." Oh, it is a sweet, sweet thought-- our Father pities us in our
   faults!

   Go a step further. A father's pity tenderly lifts up those that fall.
   When your child falls down, as children are very apt to do, especially
   when they first begin to walk, do you not pity them? Is there a nasty
   cut across the knee? It cries and the mother takes it up in her arms,
   directly. And look, she has some sponge and water to take the grit out
   of the wound! And she gives a kiss and makes it well. I know mothers
   have wondrous healing lips! And sometimes, when God's servants do
   really fall, it is very lamentable. It is very sad and it is well that
   they should cry. It were a pity that they should be willing to lie in
   the mire! But when they are up again and begin crying, and the wound
   bleeds--well, let them not keep away

   from God, "For as a father pities his fallen children, so the Lord
   pities them that fear Him." Have you come in here tonight with that cut
   knee of yours? I am sorry you should have fallen, but I am glad that
   our blessed Master is still willing to receive you! Come and trust in
   Him who is mighty to save, just as you did at first, and begin, again,
   tonight! Come along! Some of us have had many times to begin again. Do
   the same! If you are not a saint, you are a sinner--and Jesus Christ
   came into the world to save sinners. Put your trust in Him and you
   shall find restoration and, maybe, through that very fall you shall
   learn to be more careful--and from now on you shall walk more uprightly
   to His honor and

   Glory!

   But how the pity of a father comes out to a child in the matter of
   pain! With what exquisite tenderness a child's pains are soothed by a
   parent! It is very hard to stand by the bedside and see a dear child
   suffer. Have not some of you felt that you would gladly take your
   children's pains if they might be restored? You have one dear one at
   home now, the tears are in your eyes as I mention it--a life of
   suffering she has. Well, it may be others of you have children who have
   mental troubles--the body is healthy, but the little one has a fret and
   a worry. I hope you sometimes have seen your children weeping on
   account of sin--it is a blessed grief, and the sooner it comes, the
   better. In such a grief as that, as, indeed, in all others, I am quite
   sure you pity your children. So does your Father pity you! Broken
   heart, God's heart is longing to heal you! Weeping, weeping for your
   transgressions, the Father longs to clasp you to His bosom.

   Tried child of God, you that are often despondent and always ailing,
   God would not send this to you if there were not a necessity for it!
   And in sending it, He shares it as far as this text goes--and it goes
   blessedly far, for He pities you! Sometimes hard-hearted persons do not
   pity those that suffer and some forms of suffering do not awaken
   sympathy. But all the sufferings of God's people touch the heart of
   Jesus and sympathy comes to them at once. I know some of you say, "I am
   quite alone in the world and I have much sorrow." Please revise that
   hard saying! You are like your Master, of whom it is written that He
   said, "You shall leave Me alone: yet I am not alone, because the Father
   is with Me." Your Father is with you!

   I wish you had some Christian friend to speak with you as a companion,
   but in the absence of such a social confidant, there is a Friend that
   sticks closer than a brother! And there is One above who is a Father to
   you. Oh, believe it, there is no poverty, there is no reproach, there
   is no sorrow of heart, there is no pain of body in this world among
   them that fear God, but what the Lord sees it and knows all about it,
   and has a pity to them that endure it! Still passing on, our children
   have our pity when anybody has wronged them. I have heard say that
   there are some men that you might insult, almost with impunity, and
   should you even give them a blow they would stop to ask the reason
   before showing any resentment. But, if you put a hand on their
   children, you shall see the father's blood come up into his face and
   the most patient man will, all of a sudden, become the most passionate!

   There was a livid blue mark where you struck the child and the father
   looks as though he could forgive you if that were on his own body--but
   on his child? No, that he cannot endure! He turns it over and over and
   he cannot resist his indignation, that his child should be wantonly
   made to suffer! The wrongs of children call loudly for redress in the
   ears of every sensitive man or woman, but they are sure to awake a
   thrilling echo in a father's heart. "And shall not God revenge His own
   elect, which cry day and night unto Him?" I tell you that He will
   avenge them speedily, though He bears long with the adversary.

   That cry of Milton's--when he prayed God to avenge God's elect among
   the valleys of Piedmont for all the accursed persecutions of the Church
   of Rome--was certainly heard and answered! Look at Spain to this
   day--degraded among the nations because she was chief in the army of
   inquisitors and crushed out the Word of God from her midst. She cannot
   rise, the blood of saints is on her! And other nations, too, that have
   shed the blood of the righteous like water, have had to smart for it.
   That revolution in France, when blood flowed at the guillotine, was
   God's reply to St. Bartholomew, for He remembered it and took vengeance
   for His saints! And so He will till the end of the world shall come!
   There is no wrong done to His people but it is registered in God's
   archives. "He that touches you touches the apple of My eye." Christ
   seemed to sit still in Heaven till He saw the blood of His saints shed.
   And then He stood up as in indignation when they stoned Stephen. You
   remember how He cries, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" It was
   Jesus that suffered, though His saints were made to die. Leave, then,
   your wrongs with God. "Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord,"
   and let your reply be always gentleness and kindness towards those who
   hate you for righteousness' sake.

   And now, once more, the father will pity his children so as not only to
   set right their wrongs, but to remove his children's dreads. There are
   some people in the world that seem to take delight in frightening
   children with old bogey stories so that they hardly dare go out at
   night. But a kind father, if he finds his child frightened so, explains
   it all to him--he does not like to see him blanched with fear or
   haunted with terror. It may be that some here present are suffering,
   just now, because they are sorely afraid. Are any of you under a dread
   of some boding evil, as though the dark shadow of a calamity you cannot
   define were flitting before your eyes? Be sure of this--your heavenly
   Father pities you!

   There are some of our hymns that always speak of death as associated
   with pains and groans and agonizing strife. Very much of that is old
   bogey--

   "Imagination's fool and error's wretch, Man makes a death which Nature
   never made! Then on the point of his own fancy falls, And feels a
   thousand deaths in fearing one."

   How many of God's people have we seen die without pains or groans or
   dying strife! I remember one who used to be, all her life, subject to
   fear of death. She retired as usual to bed one night and when they went
   to call her in the morning, there she lay with a sweet smile upon her
   face--she had gone to Heaven in her sleep--it was evident she never
   knew anything at all about it. Are God's people, by their observation
   of other saints, driven to conclude that death is always the terrible
   thing the world says it is? I think not!

   There may be some whom God puts to bed in the dark, as we sometimes do
   our children, but usually He takes the candle with Him and sits and
   talks with His child till he falls asleep. And when he wakes up, there
   he is among the angels! God kisses the souls of His saints out of the
   bodies--

   "One gentle sigh, the fetter breaks--

   We scarcely can say, 'they're gone!'

   Before the ransomed spirit takes

   Her mansion near the Throne."

   Go to your heavenly Father and tell Him you are frightened and He has
   ways of taking away these fears, for though they may be ridiculous to
   some, a child's dreads are never too frivolous for the sympathy of a
   loving father! He meets them as if there were some great reality in
   them and so sets them aside. Whatever your needs, your woes, your
   griefs, fly away to your great Father's Mercy Seat and spread them
   there and He will give you comfort! Believe, from this night forward,
   that God pities all them that fear Him and whatever He sees of weakness
   in their nature and of sorrow in their lot He will help them. So may
   you find it now and evermore, for Christ's sake. Amen.

A Delusion Dispelled

   (No. 1651)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Though Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord God,
   they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver
   their own souls by their righteousness." Ezekiel 14:20.

   WE are told in the opening verse of this chapter that certain of the
   elders of Israel came to the Prophet and sat before him. You need not
   ask who these elders were, or from where they came because it is
   evident enough they were not a deputation from the Jews who were left
   in Judah and Jerusalem. They were individuals of distinction from among
   the exiles of Chebar. That they came to enquire of the Prophet of the
   Lord, we gather from the answer that came to them by the Word of the
   Lord. And we might, also, infer from the matter of the terrible
   denunciations that were uttered, something, at least, of the manner of
   enquiry they proposed. The men were downright hypocrites--they were
   followers of the false prophets who are exposed in the previous chapter
   as seeing vanity and divination--and then saying, "Jehovah says,"
   though Jehovah had not sent them!

   Now they come, these elders, to interview the true Prophet of the Lord,
   and before they have time to state their errand, the Word of the Lord
   confronts them with a life-like portrait of their own characters.
   "These men have set up their idols in their heart, and put up the
   stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be
   enquired of at all by them?" For persons who were idolaters at heart to
   ask counsel of the living God, as if they would learn His will, though
   they defied His Law, was a most insulting mockery! The thought which
   seems to have nestled in their breasts and prompted their visit was,
   after all, the exposure that Ezekiel has made of the wickedness of the
   land and of its inhabitants--may it not still be consistent with the
   mercy of the Lord to spare the city, as He would have spared the city
   of Sodom at the intercession of Abraham, for the sake of the few
   righteous men that remained in it?

   The answer, as you are aware, was an emphatic "No." A reference to the
   26th chapter of Leviticus and a rehearsal of the four judgments which
   should work the desolation, stand associated with the protest which is
   repeated again and again, each time, it seems to us, with more vehement
   force--"Though Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, as I live, says the
   Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but
   deliver their own souls by their righteousness."

   Now, my main objective this evening will be to assert, to illustrate
   and to enforce this one distinct feature in the moral government of
   God. In all the procedures of Divine judgment, the principle of
   individual responsibility can never be relaxed. Hence the need of
   personal piety--the absolute necessity that men and women should pray
   for themselves-- that each one should repent for himself, that each one
   should believe for himself and that each one should, in his own proper
   person, be born again by the effectual operation of the Spirit of God!

   No proxy in these matters is possible! Sponsors in religion are a
   wicked superstition--their use degrades the minds of men and profanes
   the worship of God--they ought to be forever done away with! I charge
   you, as you love God and your own souls, and the souls of
   others--sooner die than stand sponsor for child or man, for it is a
   sin, a mockery, an offense before high Heaven! Every man must take heed
   to his own soul. "Let each man prove his own work for each man shall
   bear his own burden," and every one of us must give an account for
   himself at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Among the various shifts and
   schemes for taking comfort without a satisfactory title, or a plausible
   reason--the idea adopted by some that the righteousness of their
   friends may be of some use to them--is the most pernicious!

   "They are the children of eminently gracious people. Surely," they say,
   "they cannot be lost!" They are connected with those whose name is
   known and whose memory is fragrant in Christian society. They were born
   and brought up in a house dedicated by family prayer! They have been
   cradled and nurtured in the midst of godliness. They readily believe
   that those who live in the back slums and have grown up to be wanton
   and willful, depraved and dishonest, will certainly perish--but can it
   be that those who have walked in the paths of morality and observed the
   ordinances of outward religion should be cast away? They scarcely think
   that it could be consistent with propriety to resist their claims to
   some discriminating consideration! Though they do not say as much in
   words, yet they secretly flatter themselves with the idea that the
   godliness of their ancestry and the scrupulous integrity of their
   parents will be enough to shelter them from responsibility.

   There are others, to mark a lighter shade in self-deception, who
   indulge a hope that the prayers of their dear ones will be heard for
   them, although they never pray for themselves. They fall back in time
   of need upon the belief that, surely their mother's prayers will be
   answered on their behalf, or their wife's petitions will bring down a
   blessing upon them!

   They do not embody the notion in words--I wish they did--for if people
   were to place such thoughts in black and white, they would never like
   to acknowledge them! Their folly would be too palpable. They entertain
   a hazy notion that because they have been so often prayed for, a
   blessing must come to them sooner or later! They will not awaken
   themselves to seek the mercy of the Lord, or quit their sins and lay
   hold on Christ to obtain the promise of pardon and peace--they vainly
   dream that something mysterious will happen to them one of these days
   in answer to good people's prayers. In fact, some of them eagerly ask
   the prayers of the godly, though they never pray to God for themselves!

   My text is a stern rebuke for any who have taken themselves to either
   of these refuges of lies! I want to sound an alarm and drive them out
   of their hiding places. Oh, that God may be pleased to make His own
   Word effectual to this end! "Though Noah, Daniel and Job were in it as
   I live, says the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter;
   they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness." Now, it
   cannot be denied that there is great power in godliness and a mighty
   prevalence in the intercessions of godly people to bring down rich
   blessings upon men. You are perfectly right in seeking the prayers of
   Christian friends! Why, even the Apostle Paul said, in the name of all
   the sacred ministry, "Brethren, pray for us."

   You can hardly ask for a choicer favor from the servants of God than
   that they should pray for you. But certain circumstances may entirely
   neutralize the prayers of the godly. Such circumstances were present in
   the case of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah in Jeremiah's day. They
   went on so far in idolatry and all manner of vice that God said that He
   would not hear Moses and Samuel, though they stood before Him to plead
   on their behalf! He told Jeremiah that he might as well cease to weep
   and pray, for He would never hear him for that people. And here, by
   Ezekiel, He declares that if so wonderful a trio as Noah, Daniel and
   Job should join in intercession--He would not regard even them! And
   just so it is at this hour--if men continue in their sin--if, after
   hearing the Gospel, they refuse it.

   If they persist in rejecting it; if they stifle conscience; if they
   silence the voice within. If they perniciously resolve to indulge their
   lusts and will not repent and turn to God, then the excellence of their
   friends will rather aggravate, than make amends for their guilt--and
   the prayers of their friends will be so utterly nullified and made of
   no effect, that nothing but the dread sentence will avail them--they
   must perish! They have not personally believed in Christ and accepted
   Him as their Mediator, therefore they must perish. They have dissipated
   the last vestige of hope by rejecting the only way of salvation and
   they must perish! Though they come of a line of saints and in their
   veins there runs the blood of the faithful, they must perish! Though
   they have the tradition of a sound faith handed down from generation to
   generation, and though the escutcheon that has descended to them from
   holy ancestors is free from blot--if they refuse Christ they must
   perish!

   And though they have been born and bred, cradled and cared for where
   holy hymns make up their lullaby, yet if they give not their own hearts
   to Christ, but set up idols in their hearts--they must perish--perish
   miserably with their own iniquity upon their heads. Was not Ishmael the
   son of Abraham? Yet he came not into the Covenant! Was not Esau the
   child of Isaac? Yet he obtained not the inheritance! Birth, blood and
   family count for nothing in this matter. Thus there are two
   propositions, which, as God shall help me, I will endeavor to set
   plainly before your eyes. First, the righteousness of the most godly
   cannot be of use for the ungodly. And, secondly, the prayers of the
   greatest intercessors cannot help if men persist in their unbelief.

   I. First, THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE MOST GODLY CANNOT AVAIL FOR THE
   UNGODLY. We have to prove this and we do so, first, by referring you to
   our text, and asking you to read it for yourselves. Mark how the anger
   of the Lord kindles and how the words are launched forth like hot
   thunderbolts from the lips of the Most High. The statement is clear;
   the supposition is startling, but the oath that seals the Oracle of
   Heaven appalls us. A coincidence that was not likely to occur is
   imagined to put the utmost strain on the delineation and to give
   language a stress that cannot be surpassed. As a matter of fact, we are
   told that if Noah, Daniel and Job were in the midst of Jerusalem, yet
   their conjoined virtues would not be of any use to save any but
   themselves!

   I wish I could help you to realize the picture as it must have flashed
   before the vision of the Seer. Three saints who were not
   contemporaries, for their lives on earth were passed in distant
   centuries and different circumstances, meet together in a season of
   terrible emergency. The sacred annals of those days knew no names more
   illustrious, no stars that shone more brightly, than Noah, Daniel and
   Job. Their sympathies are all excited, their hearts are in unison and
   their prayers blend together as they bow before the Altar. You look,
   you listen in trembling suspense, as you cast a glance at the miserable
   inhabitants of the doomed city and consider the fate of those captives
   who are languishing in a land far away. With what measure of acceptance
   will those passionate appeals for mercy be heard?

   Listen, the verdict comes from the Throne of God! They deliver their
   own souls by their righteousness and no more! Not one of them saves so
   much as his own son or his own daughter by his supplications! What a
   wail comes up as the inexorable decree is pronounced! But the echo that
   lingers longest in my ears is that awful oath-- "As I live, says the
   Lord God." Next to this, I am going to ask you to inspect more narrowly
   the portraits of these men of God who are presumed

   to have stood counsel for the defendants--and to have occasioned so
   much astonishment because with all their special pleading they signally
   lost their case!

   Noah is the very pattern of godly fear! A model of that "fear of the
   Lord which is the beginning of wisdom," just as Abraham was a model of
   faith and the father of the faithful. Moved with fear, he built an ark
   for the saving of his house. Heedless of the ridicule of the many about
   him, he built a huge ship on dry land. He became a preacher of
   righteousness, and though few, if any, were converted by that
   preaching, he persevered for 120 years, obediently doing what God
   commanded him, for a testimony against the ungodly. Scarcely can we
   find a better man than this second father of the human race from whom
   we have all sprung.

   Next to him we have mention made of Daniel. He was alive at the time
   when Ezekiel wrote--a young man, I suppose, of about 30 years of age.
   It is very singular that he should be sandwiched in, as it were,
   between Noah and Job-- two men of the olden world. He must have been
   highly esteemed in his own generation. Ezekiel, moved by the Holy
   Spirit, groups him with those whom history had canonized. He was a man
   greatly beloved of God and, no doubt, by his contemporaries, he was
   very much appreciated. Sterling virtue and an elevation of character
   above the common standard of a good man would be indispensable to his
   taking rank as one of so remarkable a triumvirate. And when you think
   of him--of his integrity in youth when he would not defile himself with
   the king's meat. When you think of his steadfastness in prayer in riper
   years, when, with his window open toward Jerusalem, he prayed as he had
   done before, even though by a statute of the realm, the penalty of
   making supplication to the God of the Hebrews was death--what a model
   of thorough manliness he is!

   There is a majesty about Daniel. He is the John of the Old Testament.
   He is the Seer who saw visions of God like the chosen one of Patmos.
   The combination of qualities that are embodied in such a man is worth
   your study. So chivalrous was his sense of duty that he is honored by
   kings! So holy is he in his conscience, as well as in his habits, that
   the King of kings reveals to him the secrets of His government! There
   is none like Daniel! "Yet," says God, "though in addition to Noah,
   Daniel stood before Me, his righteousness would suffice only for
   himself and could not be of the least profit to anyone else."

   To complete the trio, there is Job, to whom we have Infallible
   testimony that he was perfect and upright. Satan, himself, could find
   no fault with his character, though with fiendish malice he insinuated
   a sinister motive for Job's scrupulous integrity. "Does Job serve God
   for nothing? Have You not set a hedge about him and all that he has?
   You have blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased
   in the land. But put forth Your hand, now, and touch his bone and his
   flesh, and he will curse You to Your face." You remember that he did
   not curse God, but he blessed Him and his faith triumphed over his
   fretfulness even on the dunghill of his poverty, when he was covered
   with sores and filled with anguish! Surely Job is a model of
   excellence. "You have heard of the patience of Job." "My servant Job,"
   was the honorable designation that the Almighty gave him. Moreover, He
   bestowed on him high praise and a double blessing at the end of his
   trial.

   Now, if we had any one of these three men to plead for us, we should
   look upon him as putting a great weight in the scale. If we had for our
   next door neighbor, or brother, or father, either of these--if there
   were any transference of righteousness from one man to another--we
   should hope to shade ourselves under the wings of Noah, or Daniel, or
   Job! But here the Lord declares that if the whole three were put
   together, they should not save son or daughter. No, dear Friends, "You
   must be born again." You must be made righteous, each one for himself,
   or else if you had all these friends at court, which you have not, they
   would be unable to avert the course of justice, or obtain for you the
   slightest favor! The text puts it plainly--"Though Noah, Daniel and Job
   were in it as I live, says the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son
   nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their
   righteousness."

   This Truth of God may be further substantiated by observing the course
   of Providence as regards the things of this life. Could the merits of
   friends and parents secure the salvation of their relatives or
   children, we must expect to see "the son or the daughter" of a
   righteous man screened from the full punishment of his own misdeeds.
   But we have evidence that such is not the case. Let me give you
   Scriptural illustrations. Moses was faithful in all his house as a
   servant. He had a brother, Aaron, not so great a man as himself, but
   still an eminently holy man. Listen, you that are the sons of gracious
   men. Aaron had two sons and the father's dignity rested upon them--and
   they became priests of the Most High God. But, do you know what became
   of them? Drinking too much wine--alas, what a snare is that!--they
   entered into the Holy Place of God with strange fire and the fire of
   God consumed Nadab and Abihu, though they were the sons of Aaron! And
   what did Aaron say about them? We read this, "And Aaron held his
   peace."

   He could say nothing. He had to bow his head before God. He knew that
   it must be--that if even a child of God's High Priest pollutes the Holy
   Place, the fire of the Lord must come forth against him. Thus you see
   that Aaron could not overshadow his own sons and save them in the day
   of the Lord's anger. Take another case equally sad. David had a
   favorite son who became the cruel adversary of his own father. In open
   rebellion Absalom attempted to usurp his throne. Yet even in the tumult
   of battle, the king would have spread the aegis of protection over his
   own child. "Beware," he said to

   his generals, "that none touch the young man Absalom." You remember how
   he fled from the fray, but fled in vain--a just retribution overtook
   him. The locks of his hair in which he gloried were caught in the low
   branches of an oak and there he hung. Then, as you hear David cry, "O
   Absalom, my son, my son Absalom, my son, my son! Would God I had died
   for you!" you see that the righteousness of David could not deliver his
   son Absalom even as to this life.

   If you needed other proofs, I would give the instance of Judas, which
   is greatly to the point, not in the matter of relationship, but in the
   matter of association. Judas consorted with 11 of the princes of the
   Church of God, for such I call them, now that they have gone up to
   their thrones. No, more, Judas consorted with the Master Himself and
   dipped in the same dish with our Redeemer! Yet, you see, the
   righteousness of 11 Apostles could not cover Judas. And because he did
   not believe in Jesus, neither did the righteousness of his Master cover
   him! And so this man perished in his own iniquity. These examples I
   have given you from the Bible. Were I to try and turn over the pages of
   my recollection, I could give you many miserable proofs that the
   father's righteousness does not cover the son. I am afraid I shall
   touch a very tender string with friends here present who, in their own
   sons, have sad proof that it is so.

   I have seen the preacher of the Gospel whose son was committed to
   prison. I have known the father to be a minister of Christ and his son
   a ringleader in infidelity, or a chief actor in things too filthy and
   profane to be mentioned here. Full many a child of godly parents has,
   in this life, brought himself to beggary, to disgrace, to disease, to
   death. It is a sad fact, but it is so. There may have been, perhaps,
   grave fault at home. That I cannot tell--God knows--but so it has been
   that men who, to the best of our judgment, were not only godly, but
   eminently so, have, nevertheless, had the wretched lot to see their
   sons and daughters given up to work iniquity with both hands greedily.
   God save you from such a sorrow, but the recurrence of these facts goes
   to show that the most godly man's righteousness cannot be of use, even,
   for son or daughter. What need is there, however, that I multiply
   proofs?

   The scales of justice must be poised with an equal hand. Partiality is
   out of the question. God is no respecter of persons. Were it otherwise,
   personal obedience to the will of God could be dispensed with! There
   would be in this world a number of chartered libertines who would plead
   a mother's godliness or a father's Christian character as a setoff for
   their own indifference or profanity--as if they had a special license
   to live as they like because their parents were godly. Would you have
   it so if you could? I would not. I should think it a most dangerous
   institution. Thank God, His Divine justice has never given immunity to
   any vice. If a man eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge. A
   spendthrift shall rue the course he has run and shall beg bread, even
   though his father were a saint of the innermost sanctuary.

   If a man indulges foul passions, he shall suffer for it in his own
   body, let his father be as gracious as he may. If a man puts his finger
   into the fire, it will burn him. If he tempts the flood in time of
   danger, it will drown him. You may groan to think he was the child of
   so good a man, but the laws of Nature are not to be trifled with. If
   you act contrary to them, they will be contrary to you. Relationship,
   which is but an accidental circumstance, is not to be confused with
   religion. That the righteousness of one man could compensate for the
   recklessness of another man is a monstrous conceit. What if I am, as I
   thank God I am, the son of His handmaid? I dare not to presume on that!
   What if my father is a minister of the Gospel? What if my grandfather
   preached the Gospel? I thank God that such Grace was given to them, but
   there is nothing in that upon which I dare presume! I think the meanest
   pride in all the world is the pride of ancestry, for how on earth can a
   man have any credit due to him for a contingency which never could be
   at his own disposal? It must be a matter of God's own dispensation and
   if he has received it, why does he glory as though he had not received
   it?

   To suppose that Grace comes with ancestry would be a supposition
   exactly opposite to the declaration of the Spirit of God by John, where
   he says of the godly, "which were born, not of blood, nor of the will
   of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." There must be a
   birth by the Spirit of God, or the first birth will be nothing whatever
   to our advantage. However well-born at first, you must be born again!
   If the righteousness of one man could excuse the unrighteousness of
   another man, then the great principle of responsibility would be
   reversed. You and I, who were born in the midst of Christian
   associations, are responsible for the Light of God which we receive. If
   we sin, we cannot sin so cheaply as others. If a man transgresses
   against the holy example of parents, he scores seven for every sin to
   what another would have done who had been trained up under vicious
   surroundings. Assuredly he is not a less sinner, but a greater sinner
   who, being born in the midst of godliness, ventures to depart from the
   good way, transgress the sacred precepts, and refuse the Savior!

   That is the principle of Scripture--to whom much is given, of him much
   shall be required--and we have to say daily to you children of the
   godly, that if you fall, your exaltation by your privileges will cause
   you a more awful fall than the fall of others. We say to such as you,
   "Woe unto you, Bethsaida; woe unto you, Chorazin; woe unto you,
   Capernaum! You have seen the mighty works of Christ, which, if others
   had seen, they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes, and if you
   repent not, woe unto you!" Such is the teaching of the Word of God. But
   the opposite hypothesis that the goodness of one individual can
   compensate for the badness of another is utterly hollow, not to say
   grossly vicious! Painful though it is, dear Friends, I must carry the
   assertion a step further.

   The righteousness of good men has not availed to save their relatives
   from the terrors of the world to come. Instances of this come uncalled
   for to our recollection. Begin at the beginning. There is Cain. Who is
   his brother? Abel. Abel is a man whose faith is acceptable with God.
   Does that save Cain? No, he was of that Wicked One and slew his
   brother. And why did he slay him? Because his own works were evil and
   his brother's righteous. Cain, where are you tonight? Are you sitting
   here and do you dream that your brother, Abel, now with God, can, by
   any means, bless you? That must not be. Dispel the delusion! The
   opening chapter of history refutes it. The first two sons that were
   born to Adam depart from earth in different directions.

   Look, again, at Ishmael. His father, Abraham, the father of the
   faithful, said, "O that Ishmael might live before You!" Yet Ishmael
   becomes the very type of the children of nature who do not inherit the
   blessing that belongs to the children of promise! Look at Esau, born at
   the same birth with Jacob, children of a godly father, yet we read of
   Esau that he was a profane person. The godliness of holy Isaac does not
   save Esau! Look at Hophni and Phinehas, priests of God by office, but
   sons of Belial by character! Their father Eli, with all his faults, was
   a man who feared God. Yet as for these sons of his, they died in their
   sins, from which no sacrifice nor offering could purge them! Look at
   Jehoram--his father, Jehoshaphat, was a truly gracious man--though,
   alas, he turned aside, joined with Ahab and married his son to the
   daughter of that woman, Jezebel!

   And, ah me, how many a young man is ruined by some such perilous
   alliance! For money, for business, or for social position they are
   wedded to the ungodly. Some of you sell your daughters to the devil
   that they may make a respectable match, when you know that this unequal
   yoking is forbidden by Gospel precept! I am ashamed of Christian people
   who lend their countenance to this breach of the Lord's Commandment! In
   this world there is a blight on such unions and in the world to
   come--well, over that you would wish to draw the veil. The life of
   Jehoram was evil. His death was painful and premature. His end was
   without hope, yet he was a son of Jehoshaphat who did that which was
   right in the sight of the Lord!

   How tenaciously men will cling to the idea that godly ancestors can
   help them is illustrated from that parable of our Lord in which He
   tells us of the rich man who lifted up his eyes in Hell and cried,
   "Father Abraham." As a descendant of Abraham, he looked for pity and
   relief, even in the place of torment! Ah, but he failed to obtain a
   drop of water to cool his tongue by that plea. Take the warning to
   yourselves, Sirs, I beseech you! It does not matter of whom you may be
   descendants--they cannot relieve the pains of Hell for you! Unless you,
   yourselves, have personal faith and a personal renewal of heart, though
   you had Noah, Daniel and Job to take your part--"As I live, says the
   Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but
   deliver their own souls by their righteousness."

   II. Now I come to our second proposition. THE PRAYERS OF THE GREATEST
   INTERCESSORS CANNOT

   AVAIL IF MEN PERSIST IN THEIR UNBELIEF. God forbid that I should
   discourage any of you from praying for your parents, your children and
   your friends. Let us never leave off praying for them. But if any man
   in this place is sitting comfortably in his seat, saying, "My wife
   prays for me; my mother prays for me; my children pray for me. It will
   be all right with me--their prayers will suffice for me--without any
   penitence or faith on my part," I should like to touch him on the
   shoulder and whisper in his ear these words, "Though Noah, Daniel and
   Job were the intercessors, they could deliver none but their own
   souls."

   Noah was undoubtedly a man of prayer. Still, there was not a single
   person saved by Noah's prayers except those that went into the ark. And
   if God would give to us, His people, everything that we ask for, yet we
   would not ask Him to save you if you will not believe in Christ. If you
   set up your idols in your heart and keep the stumbling block of your
   lust before your eyes, we cannot, we dare not pray for you that you may
   be saved contrary to the Gospel! Daniel was mighty in prayer, but all
   that his prayers ever did could not save Israel from the fatal results
   of the follies to which they clung. Jerusalem was destroyed,
   notwithstanding the prayers of Daniel, and the Jews are scattered among
   all lands, notwithstanding that the holy Prophet pleaded for the
   prosperity of Zion. We can only pray according to the will of God and
   our prayers must be that you may be saved in the Lord's own appointed
   way--we cannot ask Him to change His way for you.

   Job prayed for his friends and his friends were forgiven. But, note it
   well, not without a sacrifice. They had to bring seven bullocks and
   seven rams and offer up for themselves a burnt offering before the
   prayer of Job on their behalf was heard. If you will bring a sacrifice
   for yourselves--if you will present Christ as your Sacrifice--then will
   our prayers go with yours and you shall be blessed. Had they offered no
   sacrifice, Job's prayers could not have availed for them. You must
   believe in Jesus with a faith distinctly your own. Were the whole
   Church on earth to lift up one continuous prayer and persevere in it
   from generation to generation, it could not save one unbelieving man!
   While he remains in unbelief, the wrath of God abides on him. If you
   buoy yourself up with a deceitful hope that it is different, you will
   presently sink down in blank despair.

   What a man of prayer Moses was when he held back God's hand till the
   Lord cried, "Let Me alone, that I may destroy them." But Moses besought
   the Lord God with urgent prayer and he prevailed. Yet even Moses did
   not avert the

   sentence pronounced on the generation which he had brought out of
   Egypt. Their carcasses all fell in the wilderness, save Joshua and
   Caleb. Nor could these two righteous men preserve one single person
   beyond themselves. All the intercession of Moses could not save an
   unbelieving generation. Because they believed not, they all died. As
   for Samuel, you will remember how he mourned for Saul, whom God had put
   away, till God said to him, "How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I
   have rejected him?" He had to give it up and go and anoint David. The
   prayers of the devout Prophet could not save the disobedient king!

   Oh, how this should take any of you off from a vain confidence in the
   prayers of others and lead you to pray for yourselves! And look to
   Christ for yourselves! A parent's prayers are a sad pretext for a
   child's presumption. Striving together in prayer, saint with saint,
   there is a mighty power. But what a strife is that when the soul we
   seek is struggling to be free from all restraint only to plunge deeper
   into sin! Remember, beloved Friends, that all the prayers of godly men
   put together cannot alter the rule of the Kingdom of God. And what is
   the rule of the Kingdom of God? Here is one of the rules, "Except you
   are converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into
   the kingdom of Heaven." Suppose Noah and Daniel and Job, and Moses and
   Samuel and Jeremiah--those six--should pray God to let a man go to
   Heaven without being born from above and renewed by the Spirit of God?
   Would that be of any use? Do you think the constitution of the Kingdom
   of Heaven would be altered for their asking? Oh no! The will of God is
   not affected by the whims of men.

   Well, here is another rule of the kingdom, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved; he that believes not shall be damned." Now if
   Noah, Job and Daniel were all to pray that this statute might be
   repealed and a resolution more consonant with the caprice of mortal men
   should be substituted in its place, do you think the appeal would be
   allowed? Surely our cries to God must not be complaints of His decrees!
   Our petitions must be submissive to His Word, not subversive of His
   wisdom! He will not change the ordinances of His Kingdom because men
   are stubborn! Like the laws of the Medes and Persians, His decrees can
   never be altered! They stand fast forever and they exclude forever from
   Heaven those who abide in unbelief.

   No, Sirs, if you are not reconciled to God, you cannot have fellowship
   with Him! If you are not made meet to be partakers of the inheritance,
   you cannot enter into the enjoyment of it! In the atmosphere of Heaven
   you could not breathe, for without holiness no man can see God! If you
   believe not in Jesus Christ, you must die in your sins! Remember that
   all the prayers of godly men cannot alter the nature of sin and if they
   cannot alter the nature of sin, then they that continue in it must
   perish! If we were to hold a Prayer Meeting to prevent a person from
   being burnt who would put his hand into the fire, would that be of any
   use? If a man who cannot swim will persist in leaping into the river,
   what is the use of my asking you all to pray God to preserve his life?
   If a man puts a bottle of acid to his lips and drinks it, what is the
   use of our coming together to pray that his life may be spared when the
   deadly poison is destroying it? If he drives a dagger into his heart,
   he must die, unless God is pleased to reverse that order, which,
   according to the poet, "is Heaven's first law."

   There is a way of salvation--"Believe in Jesus Christ and live"--if you
   will not have that, where are you, my Friend? Are you such a fool as to
   sit there and say, "I shall be saved by my wife's prayers"? Your wife's
   prayers will rather seal your doom! They will rise up in judgment
   against you! That you were so much prayed for implies that you were
   admonished and entreated at a most loving rate. You will not be able to
   say, "No man cares for my soul." A mother's prayers will ring in your
   ears and excite remorse when repentance is no more possible. The cries
   of the lost will be more terrible than the recollection of her tears
   and agony for you. Oh, remember this! Sin is fire and it must burn! Sin
   is Hell and it must torment the man who continues in it! There is no
   help for it. Pray as much as ever we like, if you do not get out of
   sin, you cannot get out of destruction! If you do not find pardon
   through our Lord Jesus you must be punished!

   Moreover, the prayers of good men cannot alter the conditions of the
   eternal future, so long as the present abides the same. This must be
   palpable to any sane judgment. The palace of luxury and time prison of
   penal servitude are but faint pictures of Heaven and Hell. What is
   Heaven? The abode of perfect spirits washed in the blood of the Lamb.
   The right of admission, how can it be obtained? There are
   qualifications that cannot be dispensed with. And there are
   disqualifications that cannot be denied. As British subjects, we have a
   right of petition to our Queen. But of what use would that be, if with
   a required number of signatures, we could ask her Majesty to confer the
   Victoria Cross on a burglar? Or how can you suppose that God will
   receive a rebel amongst His loyal courtiers? It cannot be!

   And what is the meaning or purpose of Hell but this--that he that will
   have sin must have sorrow? He that will hate God must be miserable.
   There is no law more immutable than, "to be good is to be happy," and
   to be bad is sooner or later to be wretched. It must be so. Trust not,
   therefore, to the prayers of others, but come to Christ for yourselves,
   that you may be cleansed from sin and made right for Heaven. Perhaps
   you say, "Sir, I did not think prayer would suffice to effect a change
   in my circumstances without a corresponding change in myself, but I
   thought that, somehow, by prayer, I should be compelled to believe and
   to repent."

   Compelled to believe and to repent? Well, Man, what sort of repentance
   and faith must that be which comes of compulsion? Surely that man's
   heart is not sincere who says, "I hope to go to Heaven, though it is
   against my own inclination." You would gladly be made to hate sin
   against your will? That is strange! Are you to be made to love
   righteousness against your own liking? I have heard of fathers saying
   that their daughters should marry So-and-So, but I defy them to make
   them love those with whom they have no feeling. No, these matters are
   far too delicate to be managed by coercion. It cannot be!

   Neither does the Holy Spirit, Himself, employ force to compel those who
   are unwilling. He has a power that is quite congruous with the freedom
   of the will by which He sweetly turns the mind and will by blessed
   argument and illumination. By enlightening the understanding, He
   controls the will. But, believe me, you will never be lugged into
   Heaven by your ears! You will never be strapped down and carried to
   Heaven as we see drunken women carried to the stationhouse on a
   stretcher. Have you ever fancied that such would be the case? Has such
   an absurd idea ever entered into your head, that somehow or other,
   without your ever seeking it, you will be taken up by some celestial
   surgery and chloroformed into Glory?

   It will not be so. Turn to this Book and see. How did the prodigal get
   to his father's house? Did his father asphyxiate him and make him
   insensible and then strap him down and carry him there? Not at all. But
   first he was hungry and he tried to fill his belly with the husks, but
   he could not. And he became more hungry, still, and then he said, "I
   will arise, and go unto my father," and he went to his father. Yes, it
   was all of Grace, but still he arose and came unto his father. It was
   all of eternal love, but he did leave the swine and seek his home. It
   was of infinite pity, but he did think and he did will to go! And, what
   is more, he did go to his father's house. He did all that and then,
   when he was a great way off, his father met him!

   Now, believe me, though I always preach free, rich, Sovereign Grace
   with all my heart, I never understood and never shall understand that
   God treats us like logs of wood and blocks of marble, and cleaves or
   chips us about as if we had no life, or will, or intelligence! It is
   not so and only fools think in such a fashion! You are men, not dumb
   driven cattle! You will not be saved like asses, but like men! You will
   not be saved like horses and mules and cats, but like men and women who
   can think! You will have to think and you will have to hate your
   sin--and you will have to cry for mercy and you will have to believe in
   Christ--and if you do not, you will perish! All the prayers that have
   ever been poured out can be of no use to save you except through your
   being brought to trust your Savior, hate your sin and become obedient
   to His will.

   Do you believe this, dear Friends? It may be that out of this large
   congregation there are only a few to whom these statements are
   particularly appropriate, but I thought that I would leave the 99 sheep
   in the wilderness--there are plenty of sweet grasses for you in the
   quiet places of the Word of God--and I would go after some that have
   gone astray in this direction, for I long to find you. Oh that the
   blessed Spirit would convince you of your sin and lead you to say, "I
   have played the fool. I have been trusting to a privilege which I ought
   to have used for another purpose. Now, I will seek God and I will yield
   to the blessed Gospel and put my trust in Jesus." Remember, there is a
   righteousness which you can have--the righteousness of Jesus Christ
   which can cover you. Though Noah and Daniel and Job cannot deliver you,
   Jesus can!

   There is an intercession that can be heard for you--the intercession of
   One that lives and was dead--and now makes intercession for men and is
   able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him. Come unto
   God by Him and His intercession is yours and shall be your health! And
   His righteousness is yours and shall be your covering! God grant it for
   the dear Redeemer's sake. Amen and amen.

The Singing Pilgrim

   (No. 1652)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage." Psalm
   119:54.

   THE 119th Psalm is said, by many, to consist of detached sentences and
   to be rather a casket of gold rings than a chain of united golden
   links, yet the position of this verse is somewhat remarkable, for the
   verse before it runs thus-- "Horror has taken hold upon me because of
   the wicked that forsake Your Law." Most of you know for yourselves what
   that sentence means, for if you hear a man swear in the streets, your
   blood runs chill with horror. And when you think of what has been said
   by blasphemers against the Person of our Divine Lord and against the
   Divine Truths of Revelation, you are horrified that men should have had
   the audacity to think--much less to say--such wicked things against the
   Most High God.

   David rightly said, "Horror has taken hold upon me," and then he added
   our text, as if he would say, "I am horrified that they should break
   the Law of God and tread it under foot, for to me it is an intense
   delight--'Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my
   pilgrimage.' That which is their scorn is my song. What they count
   dross is gold to me. How can they treat such precious Truths of God
   contemptuously?" He is horrified at the thought that what is, to him,
   the very soul of his life, and the life of his soul, should be to them
   a castoff and a hate. Surely some connection is visible here--these
   rings are evidently linked to each other.

   It is well to notice the following verse. David writes, "I have
   remembered Your name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept Your Law"--as
   much as if he had said--"It is not always daylight with me; but when it
   is, Your statutes are my song. My sun is not always above the horizon;
   but when it is dark with me and I am in trouble, I do not forget You.
   You are still my solace. I remember Your name and I am comforted. If I
   may not see Your face, it is a joy to remember Your name, for they that
   know Your name will put their trust in You. If I can but remember Your
   name when my spirits sink, I shall have my soul stayed and upheld until
   the daylight shall again break in upon my spirit." Is there not much
   sweetness in this hopeful assurance, much to make our text overflow
   with meaning?

   And now I invite you to consider the text itself. It seems to me to
   talk about three things, three things which concern us. The first is a
   pilgrim, who is, secondly, a singing pilgrim. And this brings before
   us, thirdly, his songbook--"Your statutes have been my songs in the
   house of my pilgrimage."--

   "Sweet strains to me Your Laws have been, Sweet music in my heart,
   Where on my lonely pilgrimage I sojourn all--apart."

   I. First, here is A PILGRIM. David was a type of all who are true
   disciples of Jesus. They are all pilgrims. A pilgrim is a person who is
   traveling through one country to another. If we are true to our
   profession, we are pilgrims with an emphasis, for, first, we belong to
   another country. We were not born here as to our highest nature. When
   we were born in the most emphatic sense, we were born of another
   country altogether--"not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of
   God." "Except a man is born again"--"from above," says the margin--"he
   cannot see the kingdom of God." We have been born from above. Our birth
   makes us citizens of the City which has foundations, whose Builder and
   Maker is

   God.

   We are aliens, foreigners, strangers in this world. One said of old, "I
   am a stranger with you, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were." And
   another said, "I am a stranger in the earth." Indeed, all the faithful
   confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Jesus,
   our Leader, said, "You are not of the world, even as I am not of the
   world." And the beloved Apostle said, "You are of God, little children,
   and the whole world lies in the Evil One." We are hurry-

   ing through this world as through a foreign land. We are in this
   country, not as residents, but only as visitors who take this country
   en route to Glory!

   Ungodly men live as if they never meant to die. All their plans and
   preparations are evidently arranged for tarrying in this country. But
   if God has instructed you aright, you know assuredly that you shall die
   and you have become familiar with the thought of departing from these
   shores. Here you have no continuing city, but are like the
   tent-dwelling Patriarchs, who, by their very abodes, confessed that
   they looked for a possession yet to be given them. You look not only
   upon all other men as mortal, but upon yourselves as such--nor do you
   at all regret it--you would not stay here forever if you could! You
   know that you are emigrants to the laud of the unsetting sun and these
   lands are but traversed on the road to your eternal heritage.

   This is a rare knowledge, peculiar to the godly. You may bring an
   unconverted man to be conscious of his mortality, but you cannot get
   him to realize that he is going to another land. No, he is going, he is
   going, he is going where he would not. He is hurried to the land of
   confusion and dismay where the shadow of death forever rests on
   hopeless spirits. You do not wonder, therefore, that he tries to avoid
   the remembrance of this troublesome fact, and that he journeys on with
   his eyes shut, trying to forget that his life's voyage will ever end.
   To you, dear Friends, your passage through this world is not a transit
   to somewhere or to anywhere, for you know where you are going! As Jesus
   said to the disciples, "Where I go you know, and the way you know"--you
   know which way Jesus went and you know that you will go the same
   way--for He has promised that where He, is there you shall be, also.

   One of His solemn declarations was, "Because I live, you shall live,
   also," and one of His last prayers put this promise into the form of
   authority and claim--"Father, I will that they, also, whom You have
   given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My Glory." If an
   Italian now in England passes through France on his way to Rome, he
   stays at Paris, or Lyons, or Marseilles on his journey. But all the
   while he is not a Frenchman, he is an Italian. Wherever he stays upon
   the road, he says to himself, "This is not Rome. This is not the place
   of my nativity. I have no citizen rights here. I am going onward to my
   own dear city and I must hasten as best I may until I reach it." That
   is the condition of the Chris-tian--his face is steadfastly set to go
   to the New Jerusalem--and nothing must detain him.

   A pilgrim in the old crusading times started out to reach Jerusalem.
   You know how many were stricken with that insanity in those times--I
   commend them not, but I use the illustration in all soberness. The
   Crusader journeyed on foot across Europe. Whenever he came in sight of
   a goodly city, whether it was Vienna, or Constantinople, he stood and
   gazed upon the towers, the spires, the balconies. And when he had done
   so, he turned to his companion and said, "A fair sight, my Friend, but
   it is not the Holy City to which you and I are journeying." So,
   whenever God brings us to any place, however pleasant or delightful it
   may be, it is for us to say, "A fair sight and God be thanked for it,
   but it is not the Golden City."

   Our gardens are not Paradise; our homes are not the Father's house on
   high; our comforts are not our Heaven; our resting places are not the
   everlasting rest! We must not rest contented here below. We have not
   come to that promised land of which God has spoken to us in His
   Covenant. If we were mindful of the place from which we came out, truly
   we have had many opportunities to return--but we are not mindful of
   it--our whole desire lies in the opposite direction! Our citizenship
   rights and civic privileges connect us with a city whose jeweled walls
   and shining streets are waiting for our coming! Our Captain cries to
   us, "Forward." Beyond the river our possessions lie. In another land is
   our everlasting abode. We are, then, pilgrims born in another country,
   passing through this world to an inheritance beyond.

   A pilgrim's main business is to get on and pass through the land as
   quickly as he can. You will remember how Israel desired to pass through
   the land of Sihon, King of Heshbon, and Moses offered these terms--"Let
   me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will
   neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left: only I will pass
   through on my feet." Sihon would not allow them to pass on these
   conditions--neither will the world grant us a similar privilege. The
   tribes had to fight their way and so must we. All we ask is a road. We
   may also beg the loan of six feet of earth for a sepulcher, but all
   else we will forego if we may the better proceed towards our
   inheritance! Not how to stay here in comfort, but how to pass through
   the land in holiness is our great question.

   Sometimes a home sickness is upon us and then we are weary of this
   wilderness and pine for the land which flows with milk and honey. We
   hear the inviting heralds and the songs of those who hold high festival
   in the palaces above and we groan, being burdened, and long to end the
   days of this, our banishment--

   "Let me go, oh speed my journey, Saints and seraphs lure away. Oh, I
   almost feel the raptures That belong to endless day. Often I think I
   hear the singing That is only heard above. Let me go, oh speed my
   going, Let me go where all is love!"

   As pilgrims, it is true in our case that our relatives are not, the
   most of them, in this country. We have a few Brothers and Sisters with
   us who are going on pilgrimage and we are very thankful for them, for
   good company cheers the way. It is pleasant when Christiana can take
   her dear friend, Mercy, with her, and when her boys, Matthew and James,
   can go and Mr. Greatheart with them. Though, if necessary, Christian
   must leave Christiana and all the rest behind if they will not go with
   him--still it is much more pleasant to see them going on pilgrimage
   with us. Yet the majority of those dear to us are already over yonder.
   If I may not say the majority by counting heads, yet certainly in
   weight the great majority will be found to be in the far country.

   Where is our Father? Where but in Heaven? And where is our Elder
   Brother? Is He not there, too, at the right hand of God? And where is
   the Bridegroom of our soul? The truest and best Bridegroom with whom we
   are joined in a marriage union which death cannot sever? Where, I say,
   is the Bridegroom of our souls? We know right well! And may not the
   bride desire the happy period of the home-bringing--the joyous marriage
   feast, the supper of the Lamb? Where our Father is and where Jesus is,
   must necessarily be our own country--and we are exiles till we reach
   it! If we have a clear eye for spiritual relationships, see what a host
   of our nearest and dearest ones have gone across the river, already,
   and are in Glory! Multitudes, multitudes are there! We are come unto
   "the general assembly and Church of the First-Born, whose names are
   written in Heaven."

   Let us, therefore, go on with great speed! Let us not think to tarry
   here, for our best friends and kindred have entered into their rest,
   and it becomes us to follow after them. And, you know, a man who is a
   pilgrim reckons that land to be his country in which he expects to
   remain the longest. Through the country which he traverses he makes his
   way with all speed. But when he gets home he abides at his leisure, for
   it is the end of his toil and travail. What a little part of life shall
   we spend on earth! When you and I have been in Heaven 10,000 years, we
   shall look back upon those 60 years we spent here as nothing at all! We
   will think of their pain as a pin's prick, their gain a speck, their
   duration the twinkling of an eye!

   Even if you have to tarry 80 or 90 years in this exile, when you have
   been in Heaven a million years, the longest life will seem no greater
   than a thought and you will wonder that you said the days were so weary
   and the nights so dreary, and that the years of sickness drug such a
   weary length along! Ah me, eternal bliss, what a drop you make of our
   sea of sorrow! Heaven covers up this present grief and so much overlaps
   it that we could fold up myriads of such mourning and still have
   garments ofjoy enough to clothe an army of the afflicted! We make too
   much of this poor life--and this fondness costs us dearly. Oh for a
   higher estimate of the Home country, with its delights forevermore!
   Then would the trials of a day exhale like the dew of the morning and
   scarcely secure an hour of sorrow.

   We are only here for enough time to feel an April shower of pain--and
   then we are gone among the unfading flowers of the endless May!
   Therefore let us not make the most of the least, and the least of the
   most! But let us put things in their order and allot to this brief life
   its brief consideration--and to everlasting Glory its weight of happy
   meditation! We are to dwell throughout eternity with God! Is not that
   our Home? That is not a man's residence into which he enters at the
   front door and in a moment passes out at the back and is gone, never to
   return, as though it were a mere passage from one street to another!
   And yet this is about all that Believers do as to this poor world. That
   is a man's home where he can sit down at his ease and look on all
   around him as his own and say--

   "Here will I make a settled rest, While others go and come, No more a
   stranger or a guest, But like a child at home."

   Yes, this shows that we are pilgrims, because we are here for so short
   a space compared with the length of time we shall spend in the dear
   country beyond!

   One thing that always marks us as pilgrims is this--that we are treated
   by the people of this land as strangers. Different races of men reveal
   their nationality by their speech, their dress, their manners and their
   habits. That which is perfectly natural in a Dutchman seems ridiculous
   to a Frenchman; while the customs of a Chinaman horrify a Briton! As we
   who are of the hill country pass through these lowlands, the people
   discover our foreign character and take a wondering interest in us,
   sometimes of a friendly sort, but more often of a hostile kind. They
   marvel from where we are and, as they cannot make us out, they often
   come to the conclusion that we are acting a part and are nothing better
   than hypocrites and pretenders. They, of course, are honest, and all
   who are not like they must be false and contemptible! This suspicion
   and ill will does not happen to all professors, but more or less it
   falls to the lot of all genuine Christians.

   They cannot be hid and yet they cannot be understood, for their life is
   hid. Gladly would they pass incognito through the land, but the men of
   the world will not have it so. They soon discover the pilgrim strangers
   and they think them very odd. I suppose they are so, ifjudged by the
   customs of the world. We do not drop into the ways and customs of the
   ungodly, for our Master said to us, "Have no fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them." Therefore, in
   this world, the true Christian is as strange as a Red Indian in
   Cheapside. People do not understand the saints--they cannot make them
   out--for they are constructed upon different principles from other men
   and often do things which men count foolish, unmanly and absurd.

   The laws which govern them are not such as the world esteems. Hence it
   happens that the ungodly forge a strange name for a Christian--they
   cannot make heads or tails of him and so they set him up in their
   chamber of horrors, and fix a nickname upon him. They declare right
   positively, "He is mad." Blessed madness! Another time they say, "He is
   a hypocrite." One cries, "It is cant!" Another, "It is fanaticism!"
   Those are all expressions by which the world shows that it cannot make
   us out. Are you surprised when they use such titles? You ought to be
   very much surprised if they do not use them! If the utterly worldly man
   says, "I perfectly understand you," then say to yourself, "Then I am
   like you, for if I had been different from you--if God's Grace had
   given me a different way of thinking--you would have been sure to find
   fault with me."

   Oh, never be afraid of the world's censure, Brothers and Sisters! Its
   praise is much more to be dreaded! When Socrates was told, "Such a man
   speaks well of you today," the philosopher was by no means gratified,
   but concluded that he must have done something amiss that such a fellow
   should speak well of him. Take censures out of a foul month to be your
   highest praise, but praises out of such mouths are worse than abuse. We
   are strangers, speckled birds, curious creatures--beings that are twice
   born--who have a new life which is an enigma to ungodly men. "The wind
   blows where it wills, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell
   from where it comes, or where it goes. So is everyone that is born of
   the Spirit." He is an unaccountable person. "You cannot tell from where
   he comes or where he goes."

   He who finds redemption and eternal life in Jesus is judged to be a
   strange, out-of-the-way being! He who looks for his happiness in the
   world to come is made, thereby, a pilgrim, and that is to men of this
   world a sort of gypsy life-- fictitious, romantic, absurd and
   unpractical! We who are, indeed, such, accept our appointed condition
   and the scorn which often comes with it! And from now on we break loose
   from bonds of time and sense to seek another country--that is, a
   heavenly--

   "Cheerful, O Lord, at Your command

   I bind my sandals on.

   I take my pilgrim's staff in hand,

   And go to seek the better land,

   The way Your feet have gone." II. But now, secondly, according to our
   text, the Believer is A SINGING PILGRIM--"Your statutes have been my
   songs in the house of my pilgrimage." He does not say "my song," only,
   but "my songs," in the plural, as if he had been a great singer, given
   to singing, which proves that pilgrims to Heaven are a merry sort of
   people, after all! They have their trials--some trials more than those
   which other men know--but then they have their joys and among these
   joys are sweet delights such as worldlings can never taste! On the
   whole, Moses is right in his judgment of the Lord's people: "Happy are
   you, O Israel." "Blessed are the people," says the Psalmist, "that know
   the joyful sound. They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of Your
   Countenance."

   Holy pilgrims are happy! Theirs is not the caravan of despair, but the
   march of those who go from strength to strength. I hear a voice
   objecting, "You give a rose color to facts, for some religious people
   are very gloomy." I dispute not the fact. For sure, some days are dark,
   and yet day is not the time of darkness--even at noontide he may
   dim--and yet noon is not the hour of gloom. On earth all men must eat
   some bitter herbs, whether they eat the paschal lamb or not. Moreover,
   all are not truly godly who profess to be so. They fancied they were
   religious and, therefore, felt themselves bound to keep up the
   profession--surliness and gloom are part of the buttressing by which
   they keep up the flimsy structure of their piety. Their religion is not
   real and so they make it terrible.

   If your cheek is painted, you know that its ruddy line may yield to a
   handkerchief or to a drop of perfume and, therefore, you keep your
   distance and appear reserved. The countryman's rubies are not so soon
   dissolved. The roses of good health are not so speedily uprooted. I
   have known people who painted themselves up as Christians and they felt
   it incumbent upon them to look very demure, or else their paint would
   have come off. They thought that they must add melancholy to their
   profession to imitate holiness. False notion! The gloom betrays the
   child of darkness. "But we measure people's piety by the length of
   their faces," says one. Do you? So do I and I like them short--the
   shorter the better! Those who draw very long faces do it as a matter of
   pretense and this is to be utterly condemned, for Jesus says that the
   Pharisees had such countenances that they might appear unto men to
   fast, but they were hypocrites to the core!

   Let me tell you for a certainty--for I have the experience of many to
   back me up in it--that there is a quiet, rippling rill of intense
   comfort in a Christian's heart, even when he is cast down and tried.
   And, at other times, when trials are lightened, there are cascades of
   delight, leaping cataracts of joy whose silver spray is as pure as the
   flash of the fountains of Paradise! I know that there are many here
   who, like myself, understand what deep depression of spirit means, but
   yet we would not change our lot for all the mirth of fools or pomp of
   kings! Our joy no man takes from us--we are singing pilgrims--though
   the way is rough. Amid the ashes of our pains live the sparks of our
   joys, ready to flame up when the breath of the Spirit sweetly blows on
   them.

   Our latent happiness is a choicer heritage than the sinner's riotous
   glee. When suffering greatly and scarcely able to stand, I was met by
   one who has long enjoyed good health and unbroken prosperity. His mind
   is coarse and his tongue rasps like a file. He is always fond of
   expressing his rational ideas as proof that he is a superior person.
   With sarcastic politeness he stood before me and said, "Dear, dear,
   what a sufferer you are! But it is what may be expected, for whom the
   Lord loves, He chastens." I had barely time to admit that the
   chastening had been severe before he added, "You are very welcome to
   love which shows itself in that fashion. For my part, I had rather be
   without it and enjoy the use of my limbs. I can do better without your
   God than with Him."

   Then the hot tears scalded my eyelids and forced themselves a passage.
   I could bear the pain, but I could not endure to hear my God spoken
   evil of. I flamed up in indignation and I cried, "If instead of having
   pain in my legs I had a thousand agonies in every limb of my body I
   would not change places with you! I am content to take all that comes
   of God's love. God and His chastening are better than the world and its
   delights." Truly I know it to be so! My soul has a greater inner
   gladness in her deep despondency than the godless have in their high
   foaming merriments. Yes, and even pain is tutor to praise and teaches
   how to play upon all the keys of our humanity till a more complete
   harmony comes from us than perpetual health could have produced!

   Was not Herbert right when he wrote of man's double powers of grief and
   then found in them double fountains of praise?--

   "But as his joys are double, So is his trouble.

   He has two winters, other things but one: Both frosts and thought do
   nip And bite his lips

   And he of all things fears two deaths alone. Yet even the greatest
   griefs May be reliefs,

   Could he but take them right and in their ways. Happy is he whose heart
   Has found the art

   To turn his double pains to double praise." You that are lowest down in
   the scale of visible joy. You that are broken in pieces like wrecks
   grinding upon rocks. You that are a mass of pain and poverty--you will
   give your Lord a good word, will you not? You will say, "Though He slay
   me, yet will I trust Him." At our worst, we are better off than the
   world at its best! Godly poverty is better than unhallowed riches! Our
   sickness is better than the worldling's health. Our abasement is better
   than the sinner's honors. We count it better that we suffer pain like
   to the torture of death than that we bathe in pleasure--when that
   pleasure is the effect of sin. We will take God at all the discount you
   can put upon Him! And you shall have the world and all the compound
   interest which you are able to get out of such a sham. God's people
   sing! They are the children of the sun, birds of the morning, flowers
   of the day!

   Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace. We
   hear a music which never ceases, full-toned and ascending high--and its
   soft cadences are with us in the night when darkness thickens upon
   darkness--and the heart is heavily oppressed. "Sorrowful, yet always
   rejoicing." Know you that paradox? Some of us have learned it, now,
   these many years. It seems that the Psalmist had times of very special
   delight--high days and holidays, or, as the old records write--"gaudy
   days," days of overflowing joys. "Your statutes have been my songs." He
   was not always singing--at least not at his highest pitch. But there
   were many brave times when he poured forth a song! If you and I cannot
   always sing, we do, sometimes, turn to that sweet amusement and while
   away the time.

   Remember how John Bunyan represents Mr. Ready-to-Halt, Mr. Feeble-Mind
   and all the rest of them? When they had cut off Giant Despair's head,
   they danced, and Ready-to-Halt played his part upon his crutches! Yes,
   we have our merrymaking, Brothers and Sisters, at which angels find
   themselves at home! Pilgrims can sing and touch the lively string. When
   the Lord kills Giant Despair for us, we have our Psalms and Te Deums,
   and we praise the Lord upon the high-sounding cymbals! When we are
   brought from deep distress, our God deserves a song, and He shall have
   it, too. The heathens tune their hymns to great Diana or to Jove, and
   surely the living God shall not lack for praise!

   Our hearts are poured out with as great delight and merriment as when
   the wine vats overflow. We know nothing, now, of the spirit of wine,
   for it is evil--but the wine of the Spirit--ah, that is another thing!
   It fills the heart with a Divine exhilaration which all the dainties of
   the world can never bestow! The singing pilgrim is a man who has a
   world of joy within Him and is journeying to another world, where, for
   Him, all will be joy to a still higher degree. He sings high praises
   unto God and blesses His name beyond measure, for He has reason to do
   so, reason which never slackens or lessens! Oh that we were always as
   we are, sometimes, then would our breath be praise! David remembered
   his best times. He says, "Your statutes have been my songs." He
   remembered that he sang and sang often.

   I want some of you who are troubled, tonight, to rest with us awhile
   and remember when you were the Lord's choristers and sang as heartily
   as any of the company. You have hung your harps on the willows. That is
   a bad thing to do, but it is better to hang your harp on the willows
   than to break it, for it may be taken down and used again for the
   Lord's Glory. Jesus, who has a tender heart for mourners, will see you,
   again, and your heart shall rejoice! Think not that the past has
   devoured all your happiness--hope lives, peace abides and joy is on the
   wing! Recall those sweet songs you loved to sing. Recall them, I say,
   and find in them arguments for renewed praise! If you cannot graze in
   the pastures of delight and feed upon new joys, ruminate upon the old
   ones and get from them rich nutriment for praise. Think of happier
   days, and be happier. Listen to the echoes of yours former Psalms and
   begin to sing again!

   The thing that has been is the thing that shall be. "The Lord has been
   mindful of us, He will bless us." The Psalmist bears his testimony that
   though, now, he may be mourning, yet he did once sing. I wish that
   Christians, whenever they feel discouraged and doubting, would not
   begin telling everybody, "Oh, I am bowed down," without also saying, "I
   was not always so. For years I was free as a bird and did not envy an
   angel! Nor shall I always be sorrowful. I shall wear my plumes again
   and fill the air with my songs. I am not going to be always bowed down.
   I have sackcloth on my loins today, but I remember when I was dressed
   in silken apparel and rejoiced before the Lord. My sackcloth will not
   last long. 'Weeping may endure for a night,' it is the time for dews.
   'But joy comes in the morning.' That is the time for sunlight and for
   bird singing--and so it will be with me."

   Recollect what you used to do, dear Friend, in the heyday of your
   faith--and tell others what you used to do that they may not think you
   have always been a knight of the rueful countenance! Do not let the
   Hill Mizar and the Her-monites be quite forgotten. When "deep calls
   unto deep," say--"I will remember Your former loving kindnesses and

   joys long past, and so will I put my trust in You." Well may every
   pilgrim to Heaven be a singing pilgrim because he is getting, every
   day, nearer to the land where it is all singing! There are many
   delights in Heaven, but the main thing about Heaven is the adoration of
   God. Oh, if I might once adore with my whole being, I would never ask
   to do anything else, forever, but to melt away in reverent worship of
   the blessed God!

   Oh, what singing that will be, when you will sing your best, your heart
   made perfect to sing worthily in accord with the place and theme! Oh
   for the music which is all harmony and no discord! What music that will
   be when all the dear voices which have been hushed, which we can hardly
   think of, now, without a tear, will all ring out clearly the praises of
   God--when all the myriad voices that have gone before will join in full
   chorus--when all shall be perfect and all shall be there and shall
   praise God forever! Come, Pilgrim, sing, for you are going to sing
   forever!

   Now, rehearse your blessed anthem! Sing unto the Lord now, since you
   are to sing unto the Lord world without end--

   "Such songs ha ve power to quiet The restless pulse of care And come
   like the benediction That follows after prayer. And the night shall be
   filled with music And the cares that infest the day Shall fold their
   tents, like the Arabs, And as silently steal away."

   III. Now, I must come to a close, for time admonishes me, and the last
   head was to be THE SONGBOOK--"Your statutes have been my songs in the
   house of my pilgrimage." The Bible is a wonderful book. It serves a
   thousand purposes in the household of God. I recollect a book my father
   used to have, entitled, "Family Medicine," which was consulted when any
   of us fell sick with juvenile diseases. The Bible is our book of family
   medicine. In some houses, the book they most consult, is a "Household
   Guide." The Bible is the best guide for all families. This Book may be
   consulted in every case and its oracle will never mislead. You can use
   it at funerals. There are no such words as those which Paul has written
   concerning the resurrection of the dead! You can use it for
   marriages--where else can you find such holy advice to a wedded pair?

   You can use it for birthdays. You can use it for a lamp at night. You
   can use it for a screen by day. It is a universal Book! It is the Book
   of books and has furnished material for mountains of books! It is made
   of what I call, "bibline," or the essence of books. I am preaching to
   you tonight as a man without books. I cannot get at any of my books,
   for they are all packed away! But I have a library here in having this
   one volume, which is, in fact, a number of books bound together! This
   one Book is enough to last a man throughout the whole of his life,
   however diligently he may study it. It seems that David, when he was a
   pilgrim, used the part which he had of this blessed Book as a songbook.
   It was nearly all history. What could he find to sing of there? He sang
   the wars and victories of the God of Israel!

   You and I have a bigger book than David had--can we say that, as
   pilgrims, we use this blessed Book for songs? Truly we ought to do so,
   for this is the Book that started us on pilgrimage. The blessed
   teachings of this Book, sent home by the Holy Spirit, made us flee from
   the City of Destruction and made us seek the road that leads to eternal
   life. We sing about this Book, for it is "perfect, converting the
   soul." It turned our feet from dangerous ways of folly, sin and shame.
   By the lessons of this Book--

   "Grace taught our soul to pray,

   And made our eyes o verflow," and, therefore, we sing of the gracious
   statutes of the Lord!

   We use this Book for a songbook, as pilgrims, because it tells us the
   way to Heaven. We often sing as we come to a fresh spot on the route
   and bless God that we find the road to be just as we have read in the
   way-book, just as our Divine Master said it would be! Well may we sing
   a song of gratitude for an Infallible Word. We love this Book because
   it speaks of other pilgrims who have gone this way. It is a Book full
   of stories of the worthies of old, of whom it tells us--

   "Once they were mourning here below,

   Who wet their couch with tears,

   They wrestled hard, as we do now,

   With sins, and doubts, and fears." It is very delightful to us to read
   and know how they conquered--and to learn that all true pilgrims who
   keep to the high road will conquer! So we sing of Gideon, of Barak, of
   Jephthah, of David, and, above all, of the great Prince of Pilgrims who
   went that way!

   We love this Book because it describes the life and death of the Prince
   of Pilgrims, even our Lord Jesus! Many a sweet song we get concerning
   Him, as we rehearse the story of what He did and suffered for us here
   below and what He is doing for us now! This Book tells us the
   privileges of pilgrims, both here and hereafter, and of the care which
   the Lord of Pilgrims shows towards all who seek the better country.
   Best of all, if better can be than what we have said, already, we love
   this Book because it tells us of the place to which we are going. Oh,
   how it paints that city, not in many words, but in suggestive similes!

   How wonderfully it talks to us of our abode! Why, if it said no more
   than, "they shall be with Me where I am, that they may behold My
   Glory," we would know enough of Heaven to make our hearts dance for
   joy! To be with Jesus where He is! To behold His Glory! This is bliss
   pressed down and running over, more than our hearts can hold! Have you
   ever seen the heavenly country? Have your eyes ever been permitted to
   rest upon it? "No," says one, "certainly not. 'Eye has not seen, nor
   ear heard.'" A very nice text, Brother. Go on with it; go on with it!
   You may make God say what He does not mean if you quote only half a
   text! He says, "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, the things which God
   has prepared for them that love Him; but God has revealed them unto us
   by His Spirit."

   Hence we know these joys by Revelation and that is the best of
   knowledge! The eye has not seen, but we have done with seeing with eyes
   when we deal with spiritual things! Our ears have not heard--these are
   poor deaf things. At best they only hear mortal sounds! But we have an
   inward function, faculty, power of hearing without ears! God does not
   speak in audible tones to his children and yet He speaks to them and
   they hear Him! We have a spirit which dispenses with fleshly faculties
   when it comes to dealing with God. He has revealed to us somewhat of
   the joy of communion with Christ; somewhat of the joy of conquered sin;
   somewhat of the joy of beholding His face and praising and blessing His
   name. We know, already, somewhat of the joy of being made like He and
   one with Him--and all this sets our feet on the top of Mount Clear--and
   puts the telescope to our eyes. And if our hand is steady, as, thank
   God, sometimes it is, we see the City and we long to enter it! "Your
   statutes have been my song in the house of my pilgrimage," because
   there I read of what is to be my Home when pilgrim days are over and I
   shall see the Master face to face!

   Now, dear Hearers, do you sing out of this holy Book? A country may be
   judged by its songs and so may an individual. Do you sing the Song of
   Songs? Are God's statutes royal music for you? A wise man once said
   that he would permit anybody to make the laws of a country if he had
   the making of the ballads, for these kindle the spirit and fashion the
   character. What do you sing, Brothers and Sisters? What do you sing? I
   leave that question as a heart-searching one-- what do you sing? Or are
   you one that never sings at all? Poor Soul, how do you live here and
   where will you live hereafter? Where must non-singers go? God give you
   a singing heart and may you sing unto the Well-Beloved a song touching
   the Well-Beloved and keep on singing it "till the day break and the
   shadows flee away." God bless you. Amen.

The Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus

   (No. 1653)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 9, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the
   dead according to my Gospel." 2 Timothy 2:8.

   FROM long sickness my mind is scarcely equal to the work before me.
   Certainly, if I had ever sought after brilliance of thought or
   language, I should have failed, today, for I am almost at the lowest
   stage of incapacity. I have only been comforted in the thought of
   preaching to you this morning by the reflection that it is the
   doctrine, itself, which God blesses, and not the way in which it may be
   spoken--for if God had made the power to depend upon the speaker and
   his style, He would have chosen that the Resurrection, grandest of all
   the Truths of God, would have been proclaimed by angels rather than by
   men! Yet He set aside the seraph for the humbler creature.

   After angels had spoken a word or two to the women, their testimony
   ceased. The most prominent testimony to the Resurrection of the Lord
   was, at first, that of holy women, and afterwards that of each one of
   the guileless men and women who made up the 500 or more whose privilege
   it was to have actually seen the risen Savior and who, therefore, could
   bear witness to what they had seen, though they may have been quite
   unable to describe with eloquence what they had beheld! Upon our Lord's
   rising I have nothing to say! And God's ministers have nothing to say
   beyond bearing witness to the fact that Jesus Christ of the seed of
   David was raised from the dead.

   Put it in poetry. Proclaim it in sublime Miltonic verse--it will come
   to no more! Tell of it in monosyllables and write it so that little
   children may read it in their first spelling books and it will come to
   nothing less--"The Lord is risen, indeed!" is the sum and substance of
   our witness when we speak of our risen Redeemer. If we do but know the
   Truth of this Resurrection and feel the power of it, our mode of
   utterance is of secondary consequence, for the Holy Spirit will bear
   witness to the Truth of God and cause it to produce fruit in the minds
   of our hearers.

   Our present text is found in Paul's second letter to Timothy. The
   venerable minister is anxious about the young man who has preached with
   remarkable success and whom he regards, in some respects, as his
   successor. The old man is about to put off his tabernacle and he is
   concerned that his son in the Gospel should preach the same Truths of
   God as his father has preached--and should by no means adulterate the
   Gospel. A tendency showed itself in Timothy's day and the same tendency
   exists at this very hour--to try to get away from the simple matters of
   fact upon which our religion is built-- to something more philosophical
   and hard to be understood.

   The Word of God which the common people heard gladly is not fine enough
   for cultured sages and so they must surround it with a mist of human
   thought and speculation. Three or four plain facts constitute the
   Gospel, even as Paul puts it in the 5th chapter of his first Epistle to
   the Corinthians--"For I delivered unto you, first of all, that which I
   also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
   Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third
   day according to the Scriptures." Upon the Incarnation, life, death and
   Resurrection of Jesus, our salvation hinges. He who believes these
   Truths of God, aright, has believed the Gospel and, believing the
   Gospel, he shall without doubt find eternal salvation!

   But men want novelties. They cannot endure that the trumpet should give
   forth the same certain sound! They crave some fresh fantasia every day.
   "The Gospel with variations" is the music for them! Intellect is
   progressive, they say; they must, therefore, march ahead of their
   forefathers. Incarnate Deity, a holy life, an atoning death and a
   literal Resurrection--having heard these things, now, for nearly 19
   centuries, they are just a little stale--and the cultivated mind
   hungers for a change from the old-fashioned manna. Even in Paul's day
   this tendency was manifest and so they sought to regard facts as
   mysteries or parables--and they labored to find a spiritual meaning in
   them till they went so far as to deny them as actual facts!

   Seeking an ambiguous meaning, they overlooked the fact, itself, losing
   the substance in a foolish preference for the shadow. While God set
   before them glorious events which fill Heaven with amazement, they
   showed their foolish wisdom by accepting the plain historical facts as
   myths to be interpreted or riddles to be solved. He who believed as a
   little child was pushed aside as a fool, that the disputer and the
   scribe might come in to mystify simplicity and hide the light of the
   Truth of God! Hence there had arisen a certain Hymenaeus and Philetus,
   "Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the Resurrection is
   already past; and overthrow the faith of some." Turn to verse 17 and
   read for yourselves. They spirited away the Resurrection! They made it
   to mean something very deep and mystical--and in the process they took
   away the actual Resurrection altogether.

   Among men there is still a craving after new meanings, refinements upon
   old doctrines, and spiritualization of literal facts. They tear out the
   heart of the Truth of God and give us the carcass stuffed with
   hypotheses, speculations and larger hopes. The golden shields of
   Solomon are taken away and shields of brass are hung up in their
   place--will they not answer every purpose--and is not the metal more in
   favor with the age? It may be so, but we never admired Rehoboam and we
   are old-fashioned enough to prefer the original shields of gold! The
   Apostle Paul was very anxious that Timothy should stand firm to the old
   witness and should understand, in their plain meaning, his testimonies
   to the fact that Jesus Christ of the seed of David rose again from the
   dead.

   Within the compass of this verse several facts are recorded and, first,
   there is here the great Truth of God that Jesus, the Son of the
   Highest, was anointed of God. The Apostle calls Him "Jesus Christ,"
   that is, the Anointed One, the Messiah, the Sent of God. He calls Him,
   also, "Jesus," which signifies a Savior, and it is a grand Truth that
   He who was born of Mary; He who was laid in the manger at Bethlehem; He
   who loved and lived and died for us, is the ordained and anointed
   Savior of men! We have not a moment's doubt about the mission, office
   and design of our Lord Jesus! In fact, we hang our soul's salvation
   upon His being anointed of the Lord to be the Savior of men!

   This Jesus Christ was really and truly Man, for Paul says He was "of
   the seed of David." True He was Divine and His birth was not after the
   ordinary manner of men, but still, He was, in all respects, partaker of
   our human nature and came of the stock of David. This, also, we
   believe. We are not among those who spiritualize the Incarnation and
   suppose that God was here as a phantom, or that the whole story is but
   an instructive legend. No, in very flesh and blood did the Son of God
   abide among men! He was bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh in the
   days of His sojourn here below. We know and believe that Jesus Christ
   has come in the flesh. We love the Incarnate God and in Him we fix our
   trust.

   It is implied, too, in the text, that Jesus died, for He could not be
   raised from the dead if He had not first gone down among the dead and
   been one of them! Yes, Jesus died--the Crucifixion was no delusion, the
   piercing of His side with a spear was most clear and evident proof that
   He was dead--His heart was pierced and the blood and water flowed from
   them. As a dead Man, He was taken down from the Cross and carried by
   gentle hands and laid in Joseph's virgin tomb. I think I see that pale
   corpse, white as a lily! Mark how it is stained with the blood of His
   five wounds which make Him red as the rose. See how the holy women
   tenderly wrap Him in fine linen with sweet spices and leave Him to
   spend His Sabbath all alone in the rock-hewn sepulcher.

   No man in this world was ever more surely dead than He. "He made His
   grave with the wicked and with the rich in His death." As dead they
   laid Him in the place of the dead, with napkin and grave clothes fit
   for a grave. Then they rolled the great stone at the grave's mouth and
   left Him, knowing that He was dead. Then comes the grand Truth of God,
   that as soon as the third sun commenced, Jesus rose again! His body had
   not decayed, for it was not possible for that Holy Thing to see
   corruption! But still, it had been dead and, by the power of God, by
   His own power, by the Father's power, by the power of the Spirit--for
   it is attributed to each of these in turn--before the sun had risen,
   His dead body was quickened!

   The silent heart began to beat, again, and through the stagnant canals
   of the veins, the life-flood began to circulate. The soul of the
   Redeemer again took possession of the body and it lived once more!
   There He was within the sepulcher, as truly living as to all parts of
   Him as He had ever been! He literally and truly, in a material body,
   came forth from the tomb to live among men till the hour of His
   Ascension into Heaven! This is the Truth of God which is still to be
   taught, refine it who may, spiritualize it who dare! This is the
   historical fact which the Apostles witnessed! This is the Truth of God
   for which the confessors bled and died! This is the doctrine which is
   the keystone of the arch of Christianity! And

   they that hold it not have cast aside the essential Truth of God. How
   can they hope for salvation for their souls if they do not believe that
   "the Lord is risen, indeed"?

   This morning I wish to do three things. First, let us consider the
   bearings of the Resurrection of Christ upon other great Truths of God.
   Secondly, let us consider the bearings of this fact upon the Gospel,
   for it has such bearings, according to the text--"Jesus Christ of the
   seed of David was raised from the dead according to my Gospel." And
   thirdly, let us consider its bearings on ourselves, which are all
   indicated in the word, "Remember."

   I. First, then, Beloved, as God shall help us, let us CONSIDER THE
   BEARINGS OF THE FACT THAT JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD. It is clear at the
   outset that the Resurrection of our Lord was a tangible proof that
   there is another life. Have you not quoted a great many times certain
   lines about, "That undiscovered country from whose journey no traveler
   returns"? It is not so! There was once a Traveler who said, "I go to
   prepare a place for you, and if I go away I will come again and receive
   you unto Myself; that where I am there you may be also."

   He said, "A little time and you shall see Me, and again a little time
   and you shall not see Me because I go to the Father." Do you not
   remember these words of His? Our Divine Lord went to the undiscovered
   country and He returned! He said that at the third day He would be
   back, again, and He was true to His Word! There is no doubt that there
   is another state for human life, for Jesus has been in it and has come
   back from it! We have no doubt as to a future existence, for Jesus
   existed after death! We have no doubt as to a Paradise of future bliss,
   for Jesus went to it and returned! Though He has left us, again, yet
   that coming back to tarry with us 40 days assures us that He will
   return a second time, when the hour is due, and then pledge with us for
   a thousand years and reign gloriously on earth amongst His ancients!

   His return from among the dead is a pledge to us of existence after
   death and we rejoice in it! His Resurrection is also a pledge that the
   body will surely live, again, and rise to a superior condition, for the
   body of our blessed Master was no phantom after death any more than
   before. "Handle Me, and see." Oh wondrous proof! He said, "Handle Me,
   and see"! And then to Thomas, "Reach here your finger, and behold My
   hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into My side." What
   deception is possible here? The risen Jesus was no mere spirit! He
   promptly cried, "A spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see I have."
   "Bring Me," He said, "something to eat." And as if to show how real His
   body was, though He did not need to eat, yet He did eat--and a piece of
   a broiled fish and honeycomb were proofs of the reality of the act!

   Now, the body of our Lord in its risen state did not exhibit the whole
   of His glorification, for otherwise we should have seen John falling at
   His feet as dead! And we should have seen all His disciples overcome
   with the Glory of the vision! But, still, in a great measure, we may
   call the 40 days' sojourn--"The life of Jesus in His Glory upon earth."
   He was no longer despised and rejected of men, but a Glory surrounded
   Him. It is evident that the raised body passed from place to place in a
   single moment; that it appeared and vanished at will and was superior
   to the laws of matter. The risen body was incapable of pain, of hunger,
   thirst, or weariness during the time in which it remained here
   below--fit representative of the bulk of which it was the first fruits.

   Of our body, also, it shall be said before long, "It was sown in
   weakness, it is raised in power: it was sown in dishonor, it is raised
   in Glory." Let us, then, as we think of the risen Christ, rest quite
   sure of a future life and quite sure that our body will exist in it in
   a glorified condition! I do not know whether you are ever troubled with
   doubts in connection with the world to come--as to whether it can be
   true that we shall live eternally. Here is the point which makes death
   so terrible to doubters, for while they have realized the grave, they
   have not realized the life beyond it! Now, the best help to that
   realization is a firm grip of the fact that Jesus died and Jesus rose
   again.

   This fact is proved better than any other event in history! The witness
   to it is far stronger than to anything else that is written either in
   profane or sacred records. The rising of our Lord Jesus Christ being
   certain, you may rest assured of the existence of another world! That
   is the first bearing of this great Truth of God. Secondly, Christ's
   rising from the dead was the seal to all His claims. It was true, then,
   that He was sent of God, for God raised Him from the dead in
   confirmation of His mission. He had said, Himself, "Destroy this body,
   and in three days I will raise it up." Look, there He is--the Temple of
   His body is rebuilt! He had even given this as a sign, that as Jonas
   was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so should the Son
   of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth--and
   should then come forth to life again.

   Behold His own appointed sign fulfilled! Before men's eye the seal is
   manifest! Suppose He had never risen? You and I might have believed in
   the truth of a certain mission which God had given Him, but we could
   never have believed in the

   truth of such a commission as He claimed to have received--a commission
   to be our Redeemer from death and Hell! How could He be our Ransom from
   the grave if He had, Himself, remained under the dominion of death?
   Dear Friends, the rising of Christ from the dead proved that this Man
   was innocent of every sin! He could not be held by the bands of death,
   for there was no sin to make those bands fast! Corruption could not
   touch His pure body, for no original sin had defiled the Holy One!
   Death could not keep Him a continual prisoner because He had not
   actually come under sin! And though He took sin of ours and bore it by
   imputation and, therefore, died, yet He had no fault of His own and
   must, therefore, be set free when His imputed load had been removed.

   Moreover, Christ's rising from the dead proved His claim to Deity. We
   are told in another place that He was proved to be the Son of God with
   power by the Resurrection from the dead. He raised Himself by His own
   power and though the Father and the Holy Spirit were cooperative with
   Him and, therefore, His Resurrection is ascribed to them, too, yet it
   was because the Father had given Him to have life in Himself that,
   therefore, He arose from the dead! Oh, risen Savior, Your rising is the
   seal of Your work! We can have no doubt about You now that You have
   left the tomb! Prophet of Nazareth, You are, indeed, the Christ of God,
   for God has loosed the bands of death for You! Son of David, You are,
   indeed, the elect and precious One, for You live forever! Your
   Resurrection life has set the sign-manual of Heaven to all that You
   have said and done, and for this we bless and magnify Your name.

   A third bearing of His Resurrection is this--and it is a very grand
   one--the Resurrection of our Lord, according to Scripture, was the
   acceptance of His Sacrifice. By the Lord Jesus Christ rising from the
   dead, evidence was given that He had fully endured the penalty which
   was due to human guilt. "The soul that sins, it shall die"--that is the
   determination of the God of Heaven! Jesus stands in the sinner's place
   and dies--and when He has done that, nothing more can be demanded of
   Him, for he that is dead is free from the Law of God. You take a man
   who has been guilty of a capital offense. He is condemned to be hanged.
   He is hanged by the neck till he is dead--what more has the Law to do
   with him? It has done with him, for it has executed its sentence upon
   him.

   If he can be brought back to life, he is clear from the Law. No writ
   that runs in Her Majesty's dominions can touch him--he has suffered the
   penalty. So when our Lord Jesus rose from the dead, after having died,
   He had fully paid the penalty that was due to Justice for the sin of
   His people and His new life was a life clear of penalty, free from
   liability. You and I are clear from the claims of the Law of God
   because Jesus stood in our place and God will not exact payment both
   from us and from our Substitute! It were contrary to justice to sue
   both the Surety and those for whom He stood! And now, joy upon joy! The
   burden of liability which once did lie upon the Substitute is removed
   from Him, also, seeing He has, by the suffering of death, vindicated
   Justice and made satisfaction to the injured Law of God!

   Now both the sinner and the Surety are free! This is a great joy, a joy
   for which to make the golden harps ring out a loftier style of music.
   He who took our debt has now delivered Himself from it by dying on the
   Cross. His new life, now that He has risen from the dead, is a life
   free from legal claims and it is the token to us that we whom He
   represented are also free! Listen! "Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies, who is he that
   condemns? It is Christ that died, yes, rather, that is risen again." It
   is a knockdown blow to fear when the Apostle says that we cannot be
   condemned because Christ has died in our place, but he puts a double
   force into it when he cries, "Yes, rather, that is risen again!"

   If Satan, therefore, shall come to any Believer and say, "What about
   your sins?" Tell him Jesus died for them and your sins are put away. If
   he come a second time and says to you, "What about your sins?" Answer
   him, "Jesus lives, and His life is the assurance of my justification;
   for if our Surety had not paid the debt, He would still be under the
   power of Death." Inasmuch as Jesus has discharged all our liabilities
   and left not one farthing due to God's Justice from one of His people,
   we live and are clear--and we live in Him and are clear, also, by
   virtue of our union with Him. Is not this a glorious doctrine, this
   doctrine of the Resurrection, in its bearing upon the justification of
   the saints? The Lord Jesus gave Himself for our sins, but He rose again
   for our justification!

   Bear with me while I notice, next, another bearing of this Resurrection
   of Christ. It was a guarantee of His people's resurrection. There is a
   great Truth of God that never is to be forgotten, namely, that Christ
   and His people are one, just as Adam and all his seed are one. That
   which Adam did, he did as a head for a body--and as our Lord Jesus and
   all Believers are one--that which Jesus did, He did as a Head for a
   body. We were crucified together with Christ! We were bur-

   ied with Christ! And we are risen together with Him! Yes, He has raised
   us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places in
   Christ Jesus! He says, "Because I live, you shall live also."

   If Christ is not raised from the dead, your faith is in vain and our
   preaching is in vain! And you are yet in your sins! And those that have
   fallen asleep in Christ have perished--and you will perish, too! But if
   Christ has been raised from the dead, then all His people must be
   raised, also--it is a matter of Gospel necessity! There is no logic
   more imperative than the argument drawn from union with Christ. God has
   made the saints one with Christ--and if Christ has risen, all the
   saints must rise, too! My soul takes firm hold on this and as she
   strengthens her grasp, she loses all fear of death!

   Now we bear our dear ones to the cemetery and leave them, each one in
   his narrow cell, calmly bidding them farewell and saying--

   "So Jesus slept--God's dying Son Passed through the grave and blest the
   bed! Rest here, dear saint, till from His throne The morning breaks and
   pierces the shade."

   It is not merely ours to know that our Brothers and Sisters are living
   in Heaven, but also that their mortal parts are in Divine custody,
   securely kept till the appointed hour when the body shall be reanimated
   and the perfect man shall enjoy the adoption of God! We are sure that
   our dead men shall live--together with Christ's dead body they shall
   rise! No power can hold in durance the redeemed of the Lord. "Let My
   people go" shall be a command as much obeyed by Death as once by the
   humbled Pharaoh who could not hold a single Israelite in bonds! The day
   of deliverance comes quickly--

   "Break from His throne, illustrious morn! Attend, O earth, His
   sovereign Word! Restore your trust, a glorious form He must ascend to
   meet His Lord."

   Once more, our Lord's rising from the dead is a fair picture of the new
   life which all Believers already enjoy. Beloved, though this body is
   still subject to bondage like the rest of the visible creation,
   according to the Law of God stated in Scripture, "the body is dead
   because of sin," yet, "the spirit is life because of righteousness."
   The regeneration which has taken place in those who believe has changed
   our spirit and given to it eternal life! But it has not affected our
   body further than this--that it has made it to be the Temple of the
   Holy Spirit and thus it is a holy thing--and cannot be obnoxious to the
   Lord, or swept away among unholy things.

   But the body is still subject to pain and weariness, and to the supreme
   sentence of death. Not so the spirit! There is already within us a part
   of the resurrection accomplished, since it is written, "And you has He
   quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins." You once were like the
   ungodly--under the Law of sin and death--but you have been brought out
   of the bondage of corruption into the liberty of life and Grace, the
   Lord, having worked in you gloriously, "according to the working of His
   mighty power, which He worked in Christ, when He raised Him from the
   dead, and set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places."

   Now, just as Jesus Christ led, after His Resurrection, a life very
   different from that before His death, so you and I are called upon to
   live a high and noble spiritual and heavenly life, seeing that we have
   been raised from the dead to die no more! Let us joy and rejoice in
   this! Let us behave as those who are alive from the dead--the happy
   children of the Resurrection of Christ! Do not let us be
   money-grubbers, or hunters after worldly fame. Let us not set our
   affections on the foul things of this dead and rotten world, but let
   our hearts fly upward, like young birds that have broken loose of their
   shells--upward towards our Lord and the heavenly things upon which He
   would have us set our minds! Living truth, living work, living
   faith--these are the things for living men--let us cast off the grave
   clothes of our former lusts and wear the garments of light and life!
   May the Spirit of God help us in further meditating upon these things
   at home.

   II. Now, secondly, LET US CONSIDER THE BEARINGS OF THIS FACT OF THE
   RESURRECTION UPON

   THE GOSPEL, for Paul says, "Jesus Christ was raised from the dead
   according to my Gospel." I always like to see what way any kind of
   statement bears on the Gospel. I may not have many more opportunities
   of preaching and I have made up my mind to this one thing--that I will
   waste no time upon secondary themes--and when I do preach, it shall be
   the Gospel, or something very closely bearing upon it.

   I will endeavor, each time I preach, to strike under the fifth rib and
   never beat the air. Those who have a taste for the superfluities may
   take their fill of them--it is for me to keep to the great necessary
   Truths of God by which men's souls are saved! My work is to preach
   Christ Crucified and the Gospel which gives men salvation through
   faith! I hear, every now and then, of some preaching sermons about some
   bright new nothing or another. Some preachers remind me of the emperor
   who had a wonderful skill in carving men's heads upon cherry stones!
   What a multitude of preachers we have who can make wonderfully fine
   discourses out of a mere passing thought of no consequence to anyone!

   But we need the Gospel! We have to live and die--and we must have the
   Gospel! Certain of us may be cold in our graves before many weeks are
   over and we cannot afford to toy and trifle--we need to see the
   bearings of all teachings upon our eternal destinies and upon the
   Gospel which sheds its light over our future! The Resurrection of
   Christ is vital because, first it tells us that the Gospel is the
   Gospel of a living Savior. We have not to send poor penitents to the
   crucifix, the dead image of a dead man!

   We say not, "These are your gods, O Israel!" We have not to send you to
   a little baby Christ nursed by a woman! Nothing of the sort! Behold the
   Lord that lives and was dead and is alive forevermore! Behold our
   Master who has the keys of Hell and of death! Behold in Him a living
   and accessible Savior who, out of Glory still cries with loving
   accents, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest." "He is able also to save them to the uttermost
   that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives to make intercession
   for them." I say we have a living Sav-ior--and is not this a glorious
   feature of the Gospel?

   Notice, next, that we have a powerful Savior in connection with the
   Gospel that we preach, for He who had power to raise Himself from the
   dead has all power now that He is raised! He who in death vanquishes
   death, can much more conquer by His life! He who being in the grave
   did, nevertheless, burst all its bonds, can assuredly deliver all His
   people! He who, coming under the power of the Law of God, did,
   nevertheless, fulfill the Law, and thus set His people free from
   bondage, must be mighty to save! You need a Savior strong and mighty,
   yet you do not need one stronger than He of whom it is written that He
   rose again from the dead! What a blessed Gospel we have to preach--the
   Gospel of a living Christ who has returned from the dead leading
   captivity captive!

   And now notice that we have the Gospel of complete justification to
   preach to you. We do not come and say, "Brethren, Jesus Christ, by His
   death, did something by which men may be saved, if they have a mind to
   be, and diligently carry out their good resolves." No, no! We say Jesus
   Christ took the sins of His people upon Himself and bore the
   consequences of them in His own body on the Cross--so that He died--and
   having died and paid the penalty, He lives again! And now all for whom
   He died, all His people whose sins He bore, are free from the guilt of
   sin! You ask me, "Who are they?" and I reply, as many as believe on
   Him!

   Whoever believes in Jesus Christ is as free from the guilt of sin as
   Christ is! Our Lord Jesus took the sins of His people and died in the
   sinner's place--and now being, Himself, set free, all His people are
   set free in their Representative! This doctrine is worth preaching! One
   may well rise from his bed to talk about perfect Justification through
   faith in Christ Jesus! One might as well stay asleep as rise to say
   that Jesus accomplished little or nothing by His passion and His
   Resurrection! Some seem to dream that Jesus made some little opening by
   which we have a slight chance of reaching pardon and eternal life if we
   are diligent for many years. This is not our Gospel! Jesus has saved
   His people! He has performed the work entrusted to Him! He has finished
   transgression and made an end of sin! And He has brought in everlasting
   right-eousness--and whoever believes in Him is not condemned and never
   can be!

   Once again, the connection of the Resurrection and the Gospel is
   this--it proves the safely of the saints, for if when Christ rose, His
   people rose, also, they rose to a life like that of their Lord--and
   therefore they can never die. It is written, "Christ being raised from
   the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over Him," and it is
   so with the Believer! If you have been dead with Christ and are risen
   with Christ, death has no more dominion over you! You shall never go
   back to the beggarly elements of sin! You shall never become what you
   were before your regeneration! You shall never perish, neither shall
   any pluck you out of Jesus' hands. He has put within you a living and
   incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever! He says, Himself,
   "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of living water
   springing up unto everlasting life." Therefore hold fast to this and
   let the Resurrection of your Lord be the pledge of your own final
   perseverance!

   Brothers and Sisters, I cannot stop to show you how this Resurrection
   touches the Gospel at every point, but Paul is always full of it. More
   than 30 times Paul talks about the Resurrection and, occasionally, at
   great length, giving whole chapters to the glorious theme! The more I
   think of it, the more I delight to preach Jesus and the Resurrection!
   The glad tidings that Christ has risen is as truly the Gospel as the
   doctrine that He came among men and for men presented His blood as a
   ransom! If angels sang Glory to God in the highest when the Lord was
   born, I feel impelled to repeat the note, now, that He is risen from
   the dead!

   III. And so I come to my last head and to the practical conclusion--THE
   BEARING OF THIS RESURRECTION UPON OURSELVES. Paul expressly bids us to,
   "Remember" it. "Why?" asks one, "we don't forget it." Are you sure you
   don't? I find myself far too forgetful of Divine Truths. We ought not
   to forget, for this first day of the week is consecrated for Sabbatical
   purposes to remind us to think of the Resurrection. On the seventh day
   men celebrated a finished creation. On the first day we celebrate a
   finished redemption. Bear it, then, in mind!

   Now, if you will remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David rose
   from the dead, what will follow? First, you will find that most of your
   trials will vanish. Are you tried by your sin? Jesus Christ rose again
   from the dead for your justification! Does Satan accuse? Jesus rose to
   be your Advocate and Intercessor! Do infirmities hinder? The living
   Christ will show Himself strong on your behalf! You have a living
   Christ and in Him you have all things! Do you dread death? Jesus, in
   rising again, has vanquished the last enemy! He will come and meet you
   when it is your turn to pass through the chilly stream and you shall
   ford it in sweet Company! What is your trouble? I care not what it is,
   for if you will only think of Jesus as living, full of power, full of
   love and full of sympathy--having experienced all your trials, even
   unto death--you will have such a confidence in His tender care and in
   His boundless ability that you will follow in His footsteps without a
   question! Remember Jesus and that He rose again from the dead--and your
   confidence will rise as on eagles' wings!

   Next, remember Jesus, for then you will see how your present sufferings
   are as nothing compared with His sufferings, and you will learn to
   expect victory over your sufferings even as He obtained victory. Kindly
   look at the chapter and you will find the Apostle saying in the third
   verse, "You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
   Christ," and further on in the 11th verse, "It is a faithful saying:
   For if we are dead in Him, we shall also live in Him: if we suffer, we
   shall also reign with Him." Now, then, when you are called to suffer,
   think-- "Jesus suffered, yet Jesus rose again from the dead. He came up
   out of His baptism of griefs the better and more glorious for it and so
   shall I!"

   Therefore go into the furnace at the Lord's bidding and do not fear
   that the smell of fire shall pass upon you. Go down into the grave and
   do not think that the worm shall make an end of you any more than it
   did of Him! Behold, in the Risen One, the type and model of what you
   are and are to be! Fear not, for He conquered! Stand not trembling, but
   march boldly on, for Jesus Christ of the seed of David rose from the
   dead--and you who are of the seed of the promise shall rise again from
   all your trials and afflictions--and live a glorious life!

   We see here, dear Brothers and Sisters, in being told to remember
   Jesus, that there is hope even in our hopelessness! When are things
   most hopeless in a man? Why, when he is dead! Do you know what it is to
   come down to that, so far as your inward weakness is concerned? I do.
   At times it seems to me that all my joy is buried like a dead thing and
   all my present usefulness and all my hope of being useful in the future
   are in a coffin and laid underground like a corpse. In the anguish of
   my spirit and the desolation of my heart, I could count it better to
   die than to live. You say it should not be so. I grant you it should
   not be so, but so it is!

   Many things happen within the minds of poor mortals which should not
   happen. If we had more courage and more faith they would not happen.
   Yes, but when we go down, down, down, is it not a blessed thing that
   Jesus Christ of the seed of David died and was raised from the dead? If
   I sink right down among the dead, yet will I hold to this blessed
   hope--that as Jesus rose again from the dead, so, also, shall my joy,
   my usefulness, my hope, my spirit rise! "You, which have showed us
   great and sore troubles shall quicken us, again, and bring us up from
   the lowest depths of the earth."

   This casting down and slaying is good for us. We take a deal of killing
   and it is by being killed that we live. Many a man will never live till
   his proud self is slain. O proud Pharisee, if you are to live among
   those whom God accepts, you will have to come to the slaughterhouse and
   be cut in pieces as well as killed. "This is dreadful work," says one,
   "this dividing of joints and marrow, this spiritual dismemberment and
   destruction." Assuredly, it is painful, and yet it were a grievous loss
   to be denied it! Alas, how many are so good and excellent, strong and
   wise, clever and all that, that they

   cannot agree to be saved by Grace through faith! If they could be
   reduced to less than nothing, it would be the finest thing that ever
   happened to them.

   Remember what Solomon said might be done with the fool, and yet it
   would not answer--he was to be ground in a mortar among wheat with a
   pestle--pretty hard dealing that, and yet his folly would not depart
   from him. Not by that process alone, but through some such method, the
   Holy Spirit brings men away from their folly. Under His killing
   operations, this may be their comfort that, if Jesus Christ rose
   literally from the dead, (not from sickness, but from death), and lives
   again, even so will His people! Did you ever get, where Bunyan pictures
   Christian as getting--right under the old dragon's foot? He is very
   heavy and presses the very breath out of a fellow when he makes him his
   footstool!

   Poor Christian lay there with the dragon's foot on his chest, but he
   was just able to stretch out his hand and lay hold on his sword, which,
   by God's Grace, lay within his reach. Then he gave Apollyon a deadly
   thrust which made him spread his dragon wings and fly away. The poor
   crushed and broken pilgrim, as he gave the stab to his foe, cried,
   "Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; though I fall, yet shall I rise
   again!" Brothers and Sisters, do the same! You that are near despair,
   let this be the strength that nerves your arm and steels your heart.
   "Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according
   to Paul's Gospel ."

   Lastly, this proves the futility of all opposition to Christ. The
   learned are going to destroy the Christian religion. Already, according
   to their boasting, it has pretty nearly come to an end! The pulpit is
   infertile--it cannot command public attention. We stand up and preach
   to empty benches! As you see--or do not see--nothing remains for us but
   to die decently, so they insinuate. And what then? When our Lord was
   dead, when the clay-cold corpse lay watched by the Roman soldiers, and
   with a seal upon the enclosing stone--was not the cause in mortal
   jeopardy? But how fared it? Did it die out? Every disciple that Jesus
   had made forsook Him and fled--was not Christianity then destroyed?

   No, that very day our Lord won a victory which shook the gates of Hell
   and caused the universe to stand astonished! Matters are not worse with
   Him at this hour! His affairs are not in a sadder condition, today,
   than then. No, see Him today and judge! On His head are many crowns and
   at His feet the hosts of angels bow! Jesus is the master of legions,
   today, while the Caesars have passed away! Here are His people--needy,
   obscure, despised, I grant you, still--but assuredly somewhat more
   numerous than they were when they laid Him in the tomb! His cause is
   not to be crushed! It is forever rising! Year after year, century after
   century, bands of true and honest hearts are marching up to the assault
   of the citadel of Satan! The prince of this world has a stronghold,
   here on earth, and we are to capture it! But as yet we see small
   progress, for rank after rank the warriors of the Lord have marched to
   the breach and disappeared beneath the terrible fire of death. All who
   have gone before seem to have been utterly cut off and destroyed, and
   still the enemy holds his ramparts against us.

   Do you think nothing has been done? Has death taken away those martyrs,
   and confessors, and preachers, and laborious saints, and has nothing
   been achieved? Truly if Christ were dead, I would admit our defeat, for
   they that are fallen asleep in Him would have perished! But as Christ
   lives, so the cause lives, and they that have fallen are not dead--they
   have vanished from our sight for a little while--but if the curtain
   could be withdrawn, every one of them would be seen to stand in his lot
   unharmed, crowned and victorious! "Who are these arrayed in white
   robes, and whence came they?" These are they that were defeated! Why,
   then, their crowns? These are they that were dishonored! Why, then,
   their white robes? These are they who clung to a cause which is
   overthrown! Why, then, their long line of victories, for there is not a
   vanquished man among them all?

   Let the Truth of God be spoken! Defeat is not the word for the cause of
   Jesus, the Prince of the house of David! We have always been
   victorious, Brothers and Sisters! We are victorious now. Follow your
   Master on your white horses and be not afraid! I see Him in the front
   with His blood-stained vesture around Him, fresh from the winepress
   where He has trod down His foes. You have not to present atoning blood,
   but only to conquer after your Lord! Put on your white raiment and
   follow Him on your white horses, conquering and to conquer! He is
   nearer than we think and the end of all things may be before the next
   jibe shall have come forth from the mouth of the last new skeptic. Have
   confidence in the Risen One and live in the power of His Resurrection!

"At Your Word"

   (No. 1654)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 16, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Simon answering said unto Him, Master, we have toiled all the
   night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at Your word I will let
   down the net." Luke 5:5.

   How very much may simple obedience partake of the sublime! Peter went
   to take up the net, but let it down into the sea as he said as
   naturally as possible, "At Your word I will let down the net." He was
   then and there appealing to one of the grandest principles which rules
   among intelligent beings--and to the strongest force which sways the
   universe--"At Your word." Great God, it is "at Your Word" that seraphs
   fly and cherubs bow! Your angels which excel in strength do Your
   commandments hearkening to the voice of Your word. "At Your word" space
   and time first came into existence and all things that are. "At Your
   word"--here is the cause of causes, the beginning of the creation of
   God. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made," and by that word
   was the present constitution of this round world settled as it stands.

   When the earth was formless and dark, Your voice, O Lord, was heard,
   saying, "Let there be light," and, "at Your word" light leaped forth.
   "At Your word" day and night took up their places and, "at Your word"
   the waters were divided from the waters by the firmament of Heaven. "At
   Your word" the dry land appeared and the seas retired to their
   channels. "At Your word" the globe was mantled over with green and
   vegetable life began. "At Your word" appeared the sun and moon and
   stars, "for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years." "At Your
   word" the living creatures filled the sea, the air, the land and man,
   at last, appeared. Of all this we are well assured, for by faith we
   know that the worlds were framed by the word of God.

   Acting in conformity with the word of our Lord we feel ourselves to be
   in order with all the forces of the universe, traveling on the main
   track of all real existence. Is not this a sublime condition, even
   though it is seen in the common deeds of our everyday life? It is not
   in creation, alone, that the word of the Lord is supreme, but in
   Providence, too, its majestic power is manifested, for the Lord upholds
   all things by the word of His power! Snow and vapor and stormy wind are
   all fulfilling His word. His word runs very swiftly. When frost binds
   up the life-floods of the year, the Lord sends forth His word and melts
   them. Nature abides and moves by the word of the Lord.

   So, too, all matters of fact and history are beneath the supreme word
   of God. Jehovah stands in the center of all things! As Lord of All, He
   abides at the saluting point, and all the events of the ages come
   marching by at His word, bowing to His sovereign will! "At Your word,"
   O God, kingdoms arise and empires flourish! "At Your word" races of men
   become dominant and tread down their fellows. "At Your word" dynasties
   die, kingdoms crumble, mighty cities become a wilderness and armies of
   men melt away like the hoarfrost of the morning. Despite the sin of man
   and the rage of devils, there is a sublime sense in which all
   things--from the beginning, since Adam crossed the threshold of Eden
   even until now--have happened according to the purpose and will of the
   Lord of Hosts. Prophecy utters her Oracles and history writes her
   pages, "at Your word," O Lord!

   It is wonderful to think of the fisherman of Galilee letting down his
   net in perfect consonance with all the arrangements of the ages! His
   net obeys the Law which regulates the spheres. His hand consciously
   does what Arcturus and Orion are doing without thought. This little
   bell on the Galilean lake rings out in harmony with the everlasting
   chimes! "At Your word," says Peter, as he promptly obeys, therein
   repeating the watchword of seas and stars, of winds and worlds! It is
   glorious to be keeping step with the marching of the armies of the King
   of kings!

   There is another way of working out this thought. "At Your word" has
   been the password of all good men from the beginning until now. Saints
   have acted upon these three words and found their marching orders in
   them. An ark is built

   on dry land and the ribald crowd gather about the hoary Patriarch,
   laughing at him, but he is not ashamed, for lifting his face to Heaven,
   he says, "I have built this great vessel, O Jehovah, at Your word."
   Abraham quits the place of his childhood. He leaves his family and goes
   with Sarah to a land of which he knows nothing! Crossing the broad
   Euphrates and entering upon a country possessed by the Canaanite, he
   roams as a stranger and a sojourner all his days. He dwells in tents
   with Isaac and Jacob. If any scoff at him for thus renouncing the
   comforts of settled life, he lifts his calm face to Heaven and
   smilingly answers to the Lord, "It is at Your word."

   Yes, and even when his brow is furrowed, and the hot tears are ready to
   force themselves from beneath the Patriarch's eyelids as he lifts his
   hand with the knife to stab Isaac in the heart, if any charge him with
   murder, or think him mad, he lifts the same placid face towards the
   majesty of the Most High and says, "It is at Your word." At that word
   he joyfully sheathes the sacrificial knife, for he has proven his
   willingness to go to the utmost at the word of the Lord, His God! If I
   were to introduce you to a thousand of the faithful ones who have shown
   the obedience of faith, in every case they would justify their acts by
   telling you that they did them "at God's word."

   Moses lifts his rod in the presence of the haughty Pharaoh, "at Your
   word," great God! Nor does he lift that rod in vain at Jehovah's word,
   for thick and heavy fall the plagues upon the children of Ham. They are
   made to know that God's Word returns not to Him void, but fulfills His
   purpose, whether it is of threat or of promise! See Moses lead the
   people out of Egypt, the whole host in its myriads! Mark how he has
   brought them to the Red Sea, where the wilderness does shut them in.
   The heights frown on either side, and the rattle of Egypt's war
   chariots is behind. How came Moses to so play the fool and bring them
   here? Were there no graves in Egypt that thus he brought them forth to
   die in the Red Sea? The answer of Moses is the quiet reflection that he
   did it at Jehovah's word--and God justifies that word, for the sea
   opens a wide highway for the elect of God--and they march joyfully
   through! And with timbrels and dances on the other side they sing unto
   the Lord who has triumphed gloriously!

   If in later days you find Joshua compassing Jericho and not assailing
   it with battering rams, but only with one great blast of trumpets, his
   reason is that God has spoken to him by His word! And so, right on, for
   time would fail me to speak of Samson, Jephthah and Barak--these men
   did what they did at God's word and, doing it, the Lord was with them!
   Is it bringing things down from the sublime to the ridiculous to talk
   of Peter and the net which he casts over the side of his little boat?
   Oh, no! We are, ourselves, ridiculous when we do not make our own lives
   sublime by the obedience of faith. Certainly, there may be as much
   sublimity in casting a net as in building an ark, lifting a rod, or
   sounding a ram's horn! And it is clear that if it is done in faith, the
   simplest action of life may be sublimely great! The flash of the wave,
   as it covers Peter's net may be as sublime before the Lord as the Glory
   of the Red Sea billow when it returned in its strength.

   God, who sees a world in a drop, sees wonders in the smallest act of
   faith. Do not, I pray you, think that sublimity lies in masses, to be
   measured by a scale, so that a mile shall be sublime and an inch shall
   be absurd! We measure not morals and spirituals by rods and chains! The
   common act of fishing at Christ's word links Peter with all the
   principalities, powers and forces which in all ages have known this as
   their only Law--"He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood
   fast." We, too, shall have fellowship with the sublime if we know how
   to be perfectly obedient to the Word of the Lord! This ought to be the
   rule of all Christians for the whole of their lives--"At Your word."
   This should direct us in the Church and in the world. It should guide
   us in our spiritual beliefs and in our secular acts! "At Your word."

   I wish it were so. We hear boasts that the Bible and the Bible, alone,
   is the religion of Protestants. It is a mere boast. Few Protestants can
   honestly repeat the assertion. They have other books to which they pay
   deference! They have other rules, other guides, beyond and above, and
   even in opposition to the one Word of God! It ought not to be so. The
   power of the Church and the power of the individual to please God shall
   never be fully known till we get back to the simple, yet sublime rule
   of our text, "At Your word." I am going to hammer upon that phrase,
   this morning, as God shall help me--"At Your word." This rule has many
   applications. First, I shall somewhat repeat myself by saying that it
   ought to apply to the affairs of ordinary life. Secondly, it should
   apply to matters of spiritual profiting. And thirdly, and here I shall
   enlarge, it ought to find its chief application in our great life
   business--being fishers of men.

   I. "At Your word" should apply TO ALL THE AFFAIRS OF ORDINARY LIFE. I
   mean, first, as to continuance in honest industry. "Let every man abide
   in the same calling wherein he was called." Many a man, in the present
   trying crisis, is half ready to throw up his work and run away from his
   business because he has toiled all night and taken nothing.

   Truly, the financial darkness has lasted long and does not yet yield to
   the dawn, but yet Christians must not murmur or leave their posts. Oh
   tried ones, continue to be diligent in your business, still provide
   things honest in the sight of all men. Labor on in hope! Say as Peter
   did, "Nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net."

   "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it."
   You know that Truth of God full well! Know this, also, that the Lord
   will not forsake His people! Your best endeavors will not, of
   themselves, bring you prosperity. Still, do not relax those endeavors.
   God's Word to you is to quit yourselves like men, be strong, gird up
   the loins of yours mind, be sober, and stand fast. Throw not away your
   shield, cast not away your confidence, but stand steadily in your rank
   till the tide of battle turns! God has placed you where you are--move
   not till His Providence calls you! Do not run before the cloud. Take
   down the shutters tomorrow morning and display your goods! Let not
   despondency drive you to anything that is rash or unseemly. Say,
   "Nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net."

   If I am speaking to those who are out of work just now, searching for
   some place where they can provide bread for themselves and for their
   families, as is their duty, let them hear and ponder! If any man does
   not do his best to provide for his own household, he comes not under a
   Gospel blessing, but he is said to be worse than a heathen and a
   publican--it is the duty of us all to labor with our hands for that
   which is good--that we may have to give to the needy as well as to
   those dependent on us. If, after having gone about this city till your
   feet are blistered, you can find nothing to do, do not sit at home next
   Monday sulkily saying, "I will not try again." Apply my text to this
   painful trial and yet, again, sally forth in hope, saying with Peter,
   "We have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at
   Your word I will let down the net."

   Let men see that a Christian is not readily driven to despair! No, let
   them see that when the yoke is made more heavy, the Lord has a secret
   way of strengthening the backs of His children to bear their burdens.
   If the Holy Spirit shall make you calmly resolute, you will honor God
   much more by your happy perseverance than the talkative by their fine
   speeches, or the formalist by their outward show. Common life is the
   true place in which to prove the truth of godliness and bring Glory to
   God! Not by doing extraordinary works, but by the piety of ordinary
   life, is the Christian known and his religion honored. At God's Word,
   hold on, even to the end. "Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shall you
   dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed."

   It may be, too, that you have been endeavoring in your daily life to
   acquire skill in your business and you have not succeeded, or you have
   tried to acquire more knowledge, so that you could better fulfill your
   vocation, but up to now you have not prospered as you wish. Do not,
   therefore, cease from your efforts! Christians must never be idlers.
   Our Lord Jesus would never have it said that His disciples are a sort
   of cowards who, if they do not succeed the first time, will never try
   again! We are to be patterns of all the moral virtues as well as of the
   spiritual graces! Therefore, at the bidding of the Lord, work on with
   mind and hand and look to Him for the blessing. "At His word" let down
   the net once more--He may intend to bless you largely when, by trial,
   you have been prepared to bear the benediction.

   This will apply very closely to those who are laboring hard in the
   training of children. It may be that with your own children you may not
   have succeeded yet--the boy's spirit may still be wild and proud--and
   the girl may not yet have yielded to obedience and submission. Or you
   may be working in the Sunday school, or in the Day school, trying to
   impart knowledge and to fashion the youthful minds aright--and you may
   have been baffled. But if it is your business to teach, do not be
   overcome! Stand to your work as though you heard Jesus say, "Whatever
   you do, do it heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men." Earnestly,
   then, at His word, let down the net! I counsel you, dear Friends, in
   everything to which you set your hands, if it is a good thing, do it
   with all your might! And if it is not a good thing, have nothing to do
   with it!

   It may be possible that you are called to teach the age some moral
   Truths of God. In most generations, individuals have been called to
   carry out reforms and to promote progress. You are bound to love your
   neighbor as yourself; therefore, as you have opportunity, do good unto
   all men. If you have tried, and up to now have not won a hearing, do
   not give up your point--if it is a good thing and you are a Christian
   man, never let it be said that you were afraid or ashamed. I admire in
   Palissy, the potter, not only his Christianity, which could not be
   overcome by persecution, but his perseverance in his own business of
   making pottery. His last farthing and his last breath would have gone
   in discovering a glaze, or bringing out a color! I love to see such men
   Believers. I should not like to see our Lord followed by a set of
   cowards who could not fight the common battles of life--how should such
   as these become worthy of the lordlier chiv-

   alry which wrestles with spiritual wickedness in high places? It is for
   us to be bravest among the brave in the plains of common life, that
   when we are summoned to higher fields, where still greater deeds are
   needed, we may go there trained for the higher service!

   Does it seem to you to be a little out of place to be talking thus from
   the pulpit? I do not think so. I notice how, in the Old Testament, we
   are told of the sheep and the cattle and the fields and the harvests of
   good men--and these had to do with their religion. I notice how the
   prudent woman, according to Solomon, looked well to her household. And
   I observe that we have in the Bible, a book of Proverbs, and another
   called Ecclesiastes, with little spiritual teaching in them, but a
   great deal of good, sound, practical common sense! It is evident to me
   that the Lord intends that our faith should not be penned up in a pew,
   but should walk the shop and be seen in every walk of life! The great
   principle of my text fell from the lips of a working man--and to the
   working man I return it!

   It was connected with a net and a boat--the implements of Peter's
   labor--and with these common things I would link it. And I would say to
   all who serve the Lord in this present evil world--in the name of God,
   if you have anything to do, be not so desponding and despairing as to
   cease from it, but, according to His word, once more go forward in your
   honest endeavors, and, like Peter, say--"I will let down the net." This
   may prove a word in season to some who are weary of the hardness of the
   times. I shall rejoice if it nerves an arm or cheers a heart. Have
   faith in God, my tried Brothers and Sisters. "Be you steadfast,
   unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord."

   II. IN MATTERS OF SPIRITUAL PROFITING we must, at the word of Christ,
   let down the net again. I put this, first, to those who have been up to
   this Tabernacle a great many times, heartily, if I am to believe them,
   hoping to find salvation. You have prayed before the sermon began that
   the Lord would really bless the sermon to you. Now, mark, I do not
   understand you at all! I cannot make you out because the way of
   salvation is open to you at this very moment and it is, "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." You have nothing to wait
   for--all your waiting is sinful! If you say you are waiting for the
   stirring of the pool, I tell you there is no pool to be stirred and no
   angel to stir it! That pool was dried up long ago and angels never go
   that way now.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ shut up Bethesda, when He came, and said to the
   man lying there, "Rise, take up your bed, and walk." That is what He
   says to you! You have no business waiting--but as you are, and are here
   this morning, I would earnestly invite you, at the word of Christ, who
   has bid us preach the Gospel to every creature--"believe and live." Let
   down the net once more and let it down this way--say, " My Lord, I
   believe! Help You my unbelief." Breathe a prayer to Jesus that He would
   accept you. Submit yourself to Him and beseech Him to become, now, at
   this very moment, your Savior. You will be heard! Plenty of fish are
   waiting to be taken in the net of faith. At the Lord's word, let it
   down!

   But I will now speak to others present who have been letting down their
   nets, in vain, perhaps, in the form of importunate prayer. Have you
   been praying for the conversion of a relative, or pleading for some
   other good thing which you believe to be according to the will of God?
   And, after long pleading--pleading into the night, for your spirit has
   been sad--are you tempted never to offer that petition again? Now then,
   at Christ's Word, who said that men ought always to pray and not to
   faint--at Christ's Word, who says, "Pray without ceasing"--let down the
   net and pray again! Not because the circumstances which surround you
   are more favorable, but simply because Jesus bids you, continue in
   prayer! And who knows but that this very time you will meet with
   success!

   Or have you been searching the Scriptures to find a promise which will
   suit your case? Do you want to get hold of some good Word from God that
   will cheer you? Shoals of such fish are around your boat! The sea of
   Scripture is full of them--fish of promise, I mean--but, alas, you
   cannot catch one of them. Nevertheless, try again. Go home this
   afternoon and search the Scriptures again with prayer! Beseech the Holy
   Spirit to apply a precious portion to your heart, that you may, by
   faith, enjoy the sweetness of it--and who knows but you shall, this
   very day, obtain your desire and receive a larger blessing than your
   mind can fully contain--so that in your case, also, the net shall break
   through the fullness of the favor!

   Or it may be you have been laboring a long while after some holy
   attainment. You need to conquer a besetting sin, to exercise firmer
   faith, to exhibit more zeal and to be more useful, but you have not yet
   gained your desire. Now, then, since it is the Lord's mind that you
   should be "perfect in every good work to do His will," do not cease
   from your purpose, but, at His Word, let down your net again! Never
   despair. That temper of yours will be conquered yet! That unbe-

   lief of yours will give way to holy faith! Let down the net and all the
   Divine Graces may yet be taken in it, to be yours for the rest of yours
   life! At Christ's Word still labor for the best things and He will give
   them to you.

   Or are you seeking, just now, the closer Presence of Christ and a
   nearer fellowship with Him? Are you yearning after a sight of His
   face--that face which outshines the morning? Do you wish to be brought
   into His banqueting house to be satiated with His love? And have you
   cried in vain? Then cry once more, "at His Word," for He bids you come
   to Him! His loving voice invites you to draw near. At His Word press
   forward, once again--let down the net once more--and joys unspeakable
   await you, surpassing all you have ever experienced! Thus you see that
   there is a just application of the great principle of the text to our
   spiritual profiting. God help us, by His gracious Spirit, to carry it
   out from day to day!

   III. The great principle of our text should be applied to OUR LIFE
   BUSINESS. And what is the life business of every Christian here? Is it
   not soul-winning? That we may glorify God by the bringing of others to
   the faith of Christ is the great objective of our remaining here on
   earth--otherwise we would have been caught up to swell the harmony of
   the heavenly songs. It is expedient for many wandering sheep here below
   that we should tarry here till we have brought them home to the great
   Shepherd and Bishop of souls. Our way of winning men for Christ, or, to
   use His own metaphor--our method of catching men--is by letting down
   the net of the Gospel.

   We have learned no other way of holy fishing! Men with great zeal and
   little knowledge are inventing ingenious methods for catching men, but,
   for my part, I believe in nothing but letting down the Gospel net--by
   telling out the story of the love of God to men in Christ Jesus. No new
   Gospel has been committed to us by Jesus and He has authorized no new
   way of making it known! Our Lord has called all of us to the work of
   proclaiming free pardon through His blood to all who believe in Him.
   Each Believer has a warrant to seek the conversion of his fellow men.
   May not every man seek to save his brother from the burning? Must not
   Jesus smile on any man's endeavor to deliver his neighbor from going
   down to eternal death? Has He not said, "Let him that hears say, Come"?
   Whoever hears the Gospel is to invite others to come to Christ!

   The Word of the Lord is our warrant for keeping to our one work of
   making known the Gospel--it would be a sorry act of mutiny if we were
   either to be silent, or to preach another Gospel which is not another!
   The Word of the Lord is a warrant which justifies the man who obeys it.
   "Where the word of a king is, there is power." What higher authority
   can we need? "Oh, but," they say, "you ought to advance to something
   higher than the mere elementary Doctrines of Grace, and give the people
   something more in keeping with the progress of the period." We shall
   not do so while Jesus bids us go into all the world and preach the
   Gospel to every creature! If we do what He bids us, the responsibility
   of the matter rests no longer with us. Whatever comes of it, we are
   clear if we have obeyed orders. A servant is not to justify his
   master's message, but to deliver it. This makes it a joy to preach,
   this doing it, "at Your Word." Our business is to do what Christ tells
   us, as Christ tells us--and to do this again and again so long as we
   have breath in our bodies!

   The commanding Word cries always to us, "Preach the Gospel, preach the
   Gospel to every creature!" Our justification for setting forth Christ
   Crucified and incessantly bidding men believe and live, lies in that
   same Word which bade Peter walk the sea, and bade Moses fetch water out
   of a rock! The result of this preaching will justify Him who commanded
   it! No man, at the last, will be able to say to the Savior, "You gave
   Your servants an impossible task and You gave them an instrument to
   wield which was not at all adapted to produce its end." No, but at the
   closing of all things, it shall be seen that for the salvation of the
   elect there was nothing better than a crucified Savior--and to make
   that crucified Savior known there was no better means than the simple
   proclamation of His Word by honest lips in the power of the Spirit of
   the Lord. The foolishness of preaching will turn out to be the great
   proof of the Wisdom of God!

   Brothers, you that teach in the school, or you that preach from the
   pulpit, or distribute tracts, or speak personally to individuals--you
   need not be afraid but what Wisdom will exonerate herself from all
   charges and vindicate her own methods! You may be called a fool, today,
   for preaching the Gospel, but that accusation, like rust on a sword,
   will wear off as you use the weapon in the wars of the Lord! The
   preaching of the Word of God soon puts down all clamors against
   itself-- those clamors mainly arise because it is not preached. No one
   calls the Gospel ineffective where it is smiting right and left like a
   great two-handed sword! Our reply to the outcry about the failure of
   the pulpit is to get into it and preach with the Holy Spirit sent down
   from Heaven!

   Indeed, this Word of Christ, whereby He gives us His warrant for
   letting down the net, is such that it amounts to a command, and it will
   leave us guilty if we do not obey. Suppose Simon Peter had said, "We
   have toiled all the night, and

   have taken nothing; and therefore, notwithstanding Your word, I will
   not let down the net"? Then Simon Peter had been guilty of disobedience
   to His Lord and blasphemy against the Son of God! What shall I say to
   any of my fellow Christians who profess to be called of God, and to be
   Christ's disciples, and yet never let down the net? Is it so that you
   are doing nothing for the Truth of God? That you never disseminate the
   Gospel? Is it so that you call yourselves lights of the world, and yet
   never shine? That you are sowers of the seed and yet forget that you
   have a seed basket? Am I addressing any members of this Church who are,
   in this respect, wasting their lives? Is it so that it is professedly
   your life's objective to be fishers of men and yet you have never cast
   a net, nor even helped to draw one on shore?

   Are you dwelling among us under false pretences? Are you mocking God by
   a fruitless profession which you never try to make fruitful? I have not
   the strength with which to condemn you, but I would to God your own
   conscience might fulfill that office! What shall be said of the man to
   whom the Lord gives charge that he shall make known the glad tidings of
   salvation from eternal misery--and yet he is sinfully silent? The great
   Physician has entrusted you with the medicine which heals the sick--you
   see them die about you but never speak of the remedy? The great King
   has given you the meal with which to feed the hungry and you lock the
   storehouse door, while the crowds are starving in your streets? Is not
   this a crime which may well make a man of God weep over you? This great
   London of ours is growing heathenish to the very core and yet our Lord
   has given the Gospel into the hands of His Churches--what can be the
   reason for the indifference of the godly?

   If we keep this Gospel to ourselves, coming ages will condemn us as
   cruel to our posterity. Succeeding generations will point to our era
   and say, "What sort of men were these, that had the Light of God and
   shut it up in a dark lantern?" In a century to come, when others shall
   stand in this city and walk these streets, they will say, "A curse upon
   the memory of the ministers and people who failed in their duty! They
   came to the kingdom in a solemn time but never realized their calling
   and so missed the end and objective of their being!" May we be spared
   from such a calamity as this! Yes, we have a warrant for laboring to
   spread the Truth of God, and more than a warrant--we have a statute
   from the Throne of God--a peremptory command and it is woe to us if we
   preach not the Gospel!

   Now, Brothers, this warrant from Christ is one which, if we are in the
   state of heart of Simon Peter, will be omnipotent with us this morning.
   It was very powerful with Simon Peter. For, observe, he was under the
   influence of a great disappointment, yet he let down the net. "We have
   toiled all the night." Some say, "We have had all this Gospel
   preaching, we have had all these revivals, all these stirs and nothing
   has come of it." When was that? I hear a good deal of this talk, but
   what are the facts? "Oh," you say, "you know we have had a great deal
   of revival a little while ago." I do not know anything of the sort! We
   have had flashes of light here and there, but comparatively so little
   that it is a pity to make so much of it.

   Moreover, considering the little that has ever been done for it, the
   spread of the Gospel has been marvelous! Look at Gospel work at the
   present moment in India! People say that the Christian faith is not
   spreading. I say that it is spreading wonderfully as compared with the
   labor expended and the sacrifice made! If in that land you spend a
   penny and get a thousand pounds, you have no right to say, "What is
   that? We want a million." If your desires are thus exacting, prove
   their sincerity by corresponding action! Increase your outlay! The
   harvest is wonderful, considering the little seed, but if you wish for
   more sheaves, sow more! The Church has had an enormous return for what
   little she has done. In England there have been partial revivals, but
   to what have they amounted? A flash of light has been seen in a certain
   district, but darkness has still remained supreme over the length and
   breadth of the country!

   The papers have reported a great work in a certain spot, but if the
   papers had reported the places wherein there has been no revival, we
   should have had a different view of things! A little corner at the top
   of a column would have sufficed for the good--and column after column
   would not have sufficed to make known the black side of the situation!
   The fact is, the Church has scarcely ever been in a state of universal
   revival since the day of Pentecost! There has been a partial moving
   among Christians every now and then, but the whole mass throughout has
   never burned and flamed with the earnestness which the grand cause
   demands. Oh, that the Lord would set the whole Church on fire! We have
   no cause, whatever, for disappointment. In proportion to the little
   effort put out, great things have come to us--therefore let us get to
   our nets and say no more about the night in which we have toiled!

   But next, this command in Peter overcame his love of ease. Evidently he
   was tired when he said, "We have toiled all the night." Fishing is hard
   work, especially when no fish are caught. It is natural to wish to be
   excused from further toil

   when you are already weary with unrewarded labor. I have heard some
   Christians say, "You know I had my time in the Sunday school, years
   ago, but then I worked too much for my strength." No doubt their
   efforts were stupendous in the remote ages of their youthful zeal--we
   can hardly imagine what they must have been like--for no relic remains
   to assist our conceptions! At this time they feel authorized to take
   things easy, for they owe no more to their Lord, or, at least they do
   not intend to pay any more!

   Is it so that any one of us can cease from service when it is plain
   that we do not cease from receiving mercy at the Lord's hands? Are we
   not ashamed of the case when it is plainly put? "Take it easy." Yes,
   soon, very soon, we shall take it easy, for there will be rest enough
   in the grave! Just now, while souls of men are perishing, to relax our
   efforts is wickedness. No, no, Peter! Although you may be, now, in a
   dripping sweat through having toiled all night, you must get at it
   again! He does so. The night's work is nothing, he must work in the
   day, too, if he is to catch fish! Moreover, the command of Christ was
   so supreme over Peter that he was not held back by carnal reason, for
   reason would say, "If you could not catch fish in the night, you will
   certainly not do so in the day."

   Night was the special time for taking fish on the Gennesaret lake, and
   by day, when the garish sun was lighting up the waves and letting the
   fish see every single mesh of the net, they were not likely to come
   into it. But when Christ commands, the most unlikely time is likely and
   the most unpromising sphere becomes hopeful! No act is out of season
   when Christ commands it! If He says, "go," go at once, without
   deliberation. Say not, "There are yet four months and then comes
   harvest." "The fields are white already to the harvest." Peter lets
   down the net at once and wisely does he act at Christ's word. The
   lesson to you and to me is this--Let us do as Peter did and let down
   the net personally, for the Apostle said, "/ will let down the net."

   Brother, cannot you do something, yourself, with your own heart, lips
   and hands? Sister, cannot you do something, yourself, with your own
   gentle spirit? "I was thinking about getting half a dozen friends to
   form a committee to relieve the poor around us." Nothing will ever come
   of it! The poor will not get a basin of soup or a loaf of bread. Set
   about it yourself "But I think I might get a dozen to come together and
   organize a Society." Yes, and then more resolutions and amendments all
   day long--and finish up with passing votes of mutual approbation! You
   had better get to work, yourself, as Peter did. And you had better do
   it at once, for Peter immediately let down the net, as soon as he had
   launched out into the deep. You may never have another
   opportunity--your zeal may have evaporated, or your life may be over!

   Peter, however, only let down one net, and there was the pity of it. If
   John and James and all the rest had let down their nets, the result
   would have been much better. "Why?" you ask. Because, through there
   being only one net, that net was overstrained and broke. If all the
   nets had been used, they might have taken more fish, and no net would
   have been broken. I was reading, some time ago, of a take of mackerel
   at Brighton. When the net was full, the mackerel sticking in all the
   meshes made it so heavy that the fishermen could not raise it--and the
   boat, itself, was in some danger of going down--so they had to cut away
   the net and lose the fish. Had there been many nets and boats, they
   might have buoyed up the whole of the fish--and so they might have done
   in this case. As it was, many fish were lost through the breaking of
   the net.

   If a Church can be so awakened that each individual gets to work in the
   power of the Holy Spirit, and all the individuals combine, then how
   many souls will be captured for Jesus! Multitudes of souls are lost to
   the blessed Gospel because of our broken nets--and the net gets broken
   because we are not well united in the holy service--by our lack of
   wisdom, we cause loss to our Master's cause. Ministers need not become
   worn out with labor if all would take their share! One boat would not
   begin to sink if the other boats took a part of the blessed load.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, I close by saying that if I have
   accomplished anything, this morning, by the help of God's Spirit, I
   hope I have made you ready to accept the following directory of service
   drawn from the text. The way in which to serve God is to do it at His
   Word. I pray that none of us may sink into serving the Lord as a matter
   of routine. May we never fall to serving Him in our own strength. We
   must preach, teach and labor in His name because we hear Him bidding us
   do it! We must act at His Word. If this were the case, we should work
   with much more faith, with much more earnestness and with much more
   likelihood of success. It is a blessed thing to see Christ sitting in
   the boat while you cast out the net. If you catch a glimpse of His
   approving smile, as He watches you, you will work right heartily.

   We must labor in entire dependence upon Him. We must not preach or
   teach because, in our judgment, it is the right thing to do--Peter did
   not think so--but because Jesus gives the word, and His Word is Law.
   You may not work be-

   cause you have any expectation of success from the excellence of yours
   work, or from the nature of the people among whom you labor, but
   because Jesus has given you the Command. You stand there doing a thing
   which critics sneer at as absurd, but you do it in all confidence,
   believing that it must be wise because Jesus bids you do it. I remember
   well how some of our Brothers used to talk to us. They said, "You
   preach the Gospel to dead sinners! You bid them repent and believe! You
   might just as well shake a pocket handkerchief over a grave and bid the
   corpse come out of it."

   Exactly so! They spoke the truth! But I would be delighted to go and
   shake a pocket handkerchief over graves and bid the dead live if Jesus
   bade me do so! I would expect to see the cemetery crack and heave from
   end to end if I were sent on such an errand by the Lord! I would accept
   the duty joyfully! The more absurd the wise men of our age make the
   Gospel out to be--and the more they show that it is powerless to
   produce the designed end--the more will we persevere in our old method
   of preaching Jesus Crucified! Our resolves are not to be shaken by that
   mode of reasoning. We never drew our argument for preaching the Gospel
   from the work, itself, but from the orders given us to do it!

   We would rather be acting upon the responsibility of Christ than upon
   our own. I would rather be a fool and do what Christ tells me than be
   the wisest man of the modern school and despise the Word of the Lord. I
   would rather lay the responsibility of my life at the feet of Him who
   bids me live according to His Word than seek out an objective in life
   for myself and feel that the responsibility rested on my own shoulders.
   Let us be willing to be under orders to Christ; willing to persevere
   under difficulties; willing to begin anew in His service from this very
   hour. Amen.

The Blessed Guest Detained

   (No. 1655)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 23, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then they drew near unto the village where they were going, and He
   made as though He would have gone further. But they constrained Him,
   saying, Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far
   spent. And He went in to stay with them." Luke 24:28,29.

   WHAT a blessed walk was that from Jerusalem to Emmaus! Were they not
   highly favored men to have such a companion as the Lord Jesus, to hear
   Him converse upon such a subject and to feel their hearts burning
   within them with so Divine a flame? Brothers and Sisters, these are not
   the only men who have walked with the Lord Jesus. I trust I look into
   the eyes of full many who can say, "We, too, have communed with the Son
   of the Highest. The eyes of our faith have seen Him and our ears have
   heard His voice. We have known that Jesus, Himself, drew near, and we
   have heard the Words of Holy Scripture as though they fell fresh from
   His lips, and thus they have, by the power of the Holy Spirit, burned
   in our hearts and made our hearts to burn like coals of juniper which
   have a most vehement flame."

   Thank God, our Divine Master is still the familiar Friend of His
   disciples and our walk is with Him. In one sense, "He is not here, for
   He is risen." But in another sense He is more peculiarly here because
   He has risen and, whereas, un-risen He could only have been in one
   place at a time, now that He is risen He is, by His Spirit, present
   with thousands of His people at the same moment and He walks not only
   from Jerusalem to Emmaus, but to many a village, through many a garden,
   along many a street! Jesus delights to manifest Himself to His
   people--He is not strange unto His own flesh. We are bound to bear
   witness to the fact that He is not ashamed to call us Brothers and
   Sisters and to be found walking with us.

   Yes, even to those who are not His people, Jesus comes very near at
   times. And though they know Him not, He walks at their side and this
   not in silence, for He instructs them by His Word and makes their
   hearts warm by His sacred influence. I pray that any remark, this
   morning, which shall be made to Believers may also lay hold of those
   attentive hearers to whom the kingdom has come very near, for some of
   you have often been moved in this House of Prayer as you have heard
   Jesus speak, and speak to you! And if you have not been able to call
   Him, Friend, yet you have heartily wished you could do so. You have
   been more than half inclined to cast in your lot with His disciples
   because their Master has warmed your hearts, if He has not made them
   burn--and if there has not been the glow of life, yet there have been
   many flickering desires. I pray that Jesus may never leave you, but
   that your intimacy with Him may be growing till at last you shall know
   Him and He shall know you--and there shall be a union formed between
   you which never shall be broken.

   To return to that walk to Emmaus. How short it must have seemed! By far
   too short for hearts so sad, who at every step found solace. I forget
   how many miles it was, just now. It does not matter. I should think it
   seemed as if it had scarcely begun when it ended--with such light feet
   they tripped over that pathway that they thought Emmaus had been
   attracted nearer to the city! It was so short because it was so sweet.
   The conversation was such as good men prize more than dainties. The
   intonations of that Voice must often have awakened memories within them
   which half compelled them to recognize their Lord!

   His sweet voice must have charmed them and the words He uttered, the
   wondrous words of exposition and consolation, how much they enriched
   them! Nor was that walk more sweet than solemn, for it is no mean thing
   to walk with the risen Son of God! Kings might fling their crowns away
   to enjoy five minutes of such honor--it was nothing less than sublime!
   Those Brothers must have often, during the rest of their lives, looked
   at each other and said, "We walked with Jesus!" I should think whenever
   they met, their conversation would have in it fresh recollections of
   that walk and each

   one would say to his fellow, "Brother, I have just remembered a point
   whereon the Lord spoke to us. Do you not recollect the significant hint
   which He gave us as to the meaning of the Prophet?"

   If you and I had ever actually walked with Jesus, I am half afraid we
   might have grown proud of it. At any rate, if we were helped not to be
   proud, yet it would always be a sublime memory. How sublime a thing to
   have kept pace with Incarnate Deity and marched foot to foot with Him
   who is God over all, blessed forever! No angel has ever walked with
   Jesus--they cast their crowns before Him and fly upon His errands--but
   He has not given unto angels the privilege of such familiar
   conversation. How solemn to those who all unwittingly had enjoyed it! I
   think when they knew Him, they must have been overwhelmed with the
   thought that they had been so near!

   And they must have feared, in the silence of their souls, that possibly
   they had been rashly familiar. Surely they said, each one to Himself,
   "Did we say anything improper? Was it this which made Him call us
   fools? When we were expressing our doubts, did we not grieve Him? Alas,
   that we should have so misbehaved ourselves!" They must have looked
   back upon that high honor with great awe, even as Jacob did after he
   had communed with God at Bethel and said, "Surely the Lord was in this
   place and I knew it not. How dreadful is this place! This is none other
   than the House of God, and the very gate of Heaven."

   Brothers and Sisters, it is a great thing to come near to Christ! And
   you who have not yet believed in Him, I should like you to feel in what
   a solemn position you have sometimes been placed, when, "He has been
   evidently set forth, crucified, among you!" And you have felt somewhat
   of that Presence. Jesus does not draw near to a man for nothing. He has
   an influence upon all whom He visits. Your sense of His Presence has
   left upon you a deep responsibility, especially if you have remained
   chill under the influence of His holy love and have refused to believe
   in Him. Oh, that you would think of this! Before our Lord passes on and
   leaves you to your own devices, I would have you know that the King of
   Heaven has been very near to you! Oh that you would cry out to Him, nor
   cease the cry till He comes and abides with you!

   I. This must suffice for an introduction. Oh that the Spirit of God may
   give the sermon! My subject runs thus-- First, observe in the text,
   COMPANIONS LIKELY TO PART. The walk had come to an end, for they had
   reached Em-maus where they were going and now the Master made as though
   He would have gone further. And so the holy talk was likely to end.
   Jesus is going on and they may never see Him again. The choicest of all
   conversations now draws to a close unless the Speaker can be induced to
   stop with the two favored travelers. We are told that our Lord Jesus
   would have gone further. He did not pretend that He would have gone,
   but He was actually going. It is the way of Him not to stay anywhere
   unless He is invited and pressed. I know not where He would have gone,
   but with that glorified body of His, He was under no necessity of
   finding shelter!

   He could have gone further and lodged elsewhere, or He could have
   suddenly returned to Jerusalem and in a moment have entered into the
   Apostles' meeting room though the doors were shut. It would not have
   been the first night that--

   "Cold mountains and the midnight air Witnessed the fervor of His
   prayer." Certainly He would have gone further. He says not where, but
   He knew right well. Under the circumstances, He and His companions
   seemed likely to part. Now, observe the reason of parting. They were
   not about to separate because of any ill-will on the part of those who
   had walked with Him. No anger had broken out--nothing that He had said
   had awakened any animosity-- very, very far from it! They felt an
   intense reverence for the unknown Stranger and sincere gratitude to Him
   for the charming words which He had addressed them. He was likely to
   have gone further, but not because of any argument between them.

   Nor would they have parted because of any weariness of Him on their
   part. He had not talked away and tired them out so that they would be
   glad to see the back of Him. The rest of the narrative shows that they
   were in a very different condition of heart from that. If Jesus had
   gone further, they would have lost His delightful society through
   forgetfulness. Turning into his house--for I suppose one of them lived
   there and there does not appear to have been anybody else in the
   house--one of them spread the simple repast for his friend. And what if
   in his care about the evening meal he had forgotten to invite the
   wonderful Stranger? If Jesus had gone further, it would have been
   entirely because they forgot to invite Him, or failed to urge Him to
   stay! They could not have felt an utter indifference to Him, but they
   might have forgotten to press their hospitality upon Him.

   Many have short memories when hospitality is concerned. Sometimes we
   have failed to invite a friend when he needed our kindness--and we have
   felt sorry for it afterwards. They might have supposed that if He went
   further, so important a Person was too great to tarry with them and,
   perhaps, so wise a Person had an errand further on which required
   immediate dispatch and, therefore, He could not remain with them. Thus
   they might have let Him go. Had they lost Him it would have been simply
   through forgetfulness and inadvertence. Brothers and Sisters, I hope
   there are very few of us, who love the Lord, who are likely ever to
   lose communion with Him through any weariness of Him, or distaste of
   Him.

   Oh no--the happiest moments we have ever had have been spent in Jesus'
   company--and we are never so blessed as when He opens the Scriptures to
   us and opens our hearts to receive them. But we are in danger lest in
   the press of worldly cares; lest in our frequent conversations with our
   fellow men; lest, even, in our attendances upon the domestic concerns
   of our own little home, we may forget to invite Jesus to abide with us!
   Communion with the Lord is more often broken by lack of thought than by
   lack of heart, though, alas, when the lack of thought has let Him, "go
   further," then it has cooled down into that rock of ice which we have
   called a lack of heart. Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, let us charge
   our hearts that we never forget to entertain the Savior.

   Let this be our first thought--that we give Jesus a lodging in our
   souls. Be this our morning prayer, "Abide with us." Be this our evening
   petition, "Abide with us." Be this the prayer all day long, "Abide with
   us." May we resolve that under no circumstances will we permit our
   souls to be at rest unless we rest in Him, or to be happy except He
   shall be our joy! You see, if the two disciples had lost our Lord's
   company, it would have been simply through neglect. And if you and I
   lose Him, it may be through a neglect which we think excusable because
   we were so very busy and so intensely occupied. But this will not alter
   the fact, nor bring back our Lord. Oh do not let us treat Him so badly!
   Are there other objects beneath the sun or above the sun, on earth or
   in Heaven, that are worthy to come between us and Christ for a single
   moment? Will a wife treat her loving husband with coldness and then
   excuse herself that she had other matters on her hands? It may be so,
   but never, never let the Lord's redeemed treat their Redeemer as though
   He might be left in any hole or corner till a more convenient time!

   The point at which they were at all likely to part company with Christ
   is worth noting, for it may give us timely warning. It was, first, a
   point of change. They had been walking with Him and the journey was
   over. They had been out of doors, but now they have come to their house
   and are about to enter. Always there is a danger to us of missing
   fellowship with Christ at points of change--and especially at seasons
   of greatly altered circumstances. I do not wish, Brethren, that you and
   I should be often transplanted--trees do not flourish well when this
   happens to them. I knew a friend who appeared to be wedded to the
   Gospel and was zealous in promoting it when he was persecuted very
   severely by his father. His father died and he inherited the old man's
   property--and from that hour he was not seen in his former place--nor
   did he manifest any love to the Lord. This is sad.

   I would hardly dare to pray for some men that they might have a change
   from persecution to prosperity--plants that flourish amid ice and snow
   are burned up when placed beneath a tropical sun. I have known those
   who appeared to love their Master right heartily when they were poor!
   They have become rich and now where is their ardor? I hope they have
   not altogether cast off affection for the sacred name, but certainly
   the people with whom they once associated know nothing of them, now,
   and they are not engaged in those holy works in which they formerly
   delighted. How dare I pray for the temporal prosperity of those who
   would degenerate beneath its influence?

   On the other hand, I have known many who once were in comfortable
   circumstances and when prosperous they appeared to walk with God. As
   far as we could judge, they were patterns of godliness. But they fell
   upon hard times and they grew poorer and poorer till they tasted the
   bitterness of need--and now they say they do not like to be seen by
   those who knew them and, therefore, they stay away from the House of
   God. They have lost the comforts of religion when they most need them!
   They have lost worldly substance and, alas, lost fellowship with Christ
   as well! This is equally sad, for whether Jesus leaves us at the golden
   gate, or at the broken-down door of poverty, His departure is equally a
   calamity! I am mentioning facts. I give no names, but I have seen these
   things many times and, therefore, I have drawn this deduction, that at
   points of change there is danger. I suppose there is upon the railway a
   measure of peril at the switches where the train is turned upon another
   line--and it is certainly so on the main line to Glory. At all times it
   is well to watch, but especially when we are entering upon new duties,
   new trials, new temptations. Lord, let not the novelty of our position
   fascinate us even for a moment, but evermore You abide with us!

   It was a point, too, where something had been accomplished. They had
   finished their journey and reached their homes. Oh, we are such poor
   things that we can hardly complete anything without being
   self-satisfied. As little a thing as a finished walk will exalt little
   minds. But if it is some greater work, the peril is increased. When
   Christ said, "It is finished," He opened a river of comfort. But when
   we exclaim, "I have finished it," we too often set our minds on fire
   with pride! Certain men have undertaken a work for Jesus and they have
   done it by the Holy Spirit's blessing--and now they feel so pleased
   with themselves and so satisfied that they are likely to spoil all and
   give their Lord occasion for grief! The lowly Jesus does not seek
   self-exalting companions! I have known Him go many a mile to speak with
   the contrite, and it is His delight to dwell with the
   broken-hearted--but with those who have done something and, therefore,
   feel that they do not further need His Presence, He soon parts company.
   Nothing drives Christ and holy angels out of a room like the foul odor
   of pride!

   Then, dear Friends, they were now about to rest for a time. They had
   reached home and they looked for repose after the excitements of the
   week. They had been detained at Jerusalem by grand, yet terrible
   events, and one of them was glad, that day, to lodge in his own house.
   As for the other, he was glad to get out of the city and retire with
   his friend, for a little till good news should come from the Apostles.
   They both hoped for a little peace. Just then the Master made as though
   He would have gone further--and when you and I are promising ourselves
   repose, such as we have known little of upon earth--it is especially
   well, at such times, to ask the Master to abide with us!

   When we are in the battle we are sure to beg Him to abide with us
   because He covers our head and we cannot live without Him. And when we
   are proceeding in a weary walk we are likely to pray Him to remain with
   us, for we are then leaning on our Beloved. But when we sit down upon
   the seat of ease, sleep too often creeps over us. Having put off our
   traveling sandals and stretched ourselves at ease--ah, then there is
   the possibility, the sad possibility--of the Master's going further
   while we take our rest. He is always going further and when we resolve
   to go no further, but to consider ourselves to have attained, then our
   Lord will soon be gone! We must not take the slogan of the famous
   statesman who has been so often laughed at for his finality--we must
   not say, "Rest and be thankful"--or we shall soon come to grief. If we
   fall into that vein, it is well to remember that just at such a point
   Jesus and the disciple are apt to break fellowship. I mention this that
   we may be wise in the hour of trial.

   Now, had they parted company, the act would have been most blameworthy
   on their part. To have lost the society of such a Friend, how foolish!
   Here was One who had instructed them with tenderness and skill--One who
   spoke as never man spoke--would they let Him go? Here was One who
   evidently could explain their mysterious sorrows and take the sting out
   of their grief--would they let Him pass on? They had been fools,
   indeed, if they had done so! It would have shown that they did not
   appreciate His teaching, nor feel grateful for His opening to them the
   Scriptures. It would have been gross folly!

   And yet there is another thought. It was toward evening, and night was
   lowering and, therefore, they said, "Abide with us, for it is toward
   evening." It would have been very cruel to have allowed Him to journey
   on in the dark and the dews. Would we thus treat any friend of ours?
   Could we allow a beloved one to abide abroad all night? Was not that
   His own argument in the Golden Canticle, when He knocked and said,
   "Open to Me, My sister, My love, My dove, My unde-filed: for My head is
   filled with dew, and My locks with the drops of the night"? It would
   have been inhospitable on their part--inhuman for them to leave Him to
   continue His journey in the darkness of the gathering night when they
   had a home in which they could entertain Him!

   And so I charge it upon my own soul to never let Jesus be left
   unhoused; a Stranger who has not where to lay His head! All hearts are
   cold in every place towards the Well-Beloved! It is a cold world for
   Jesus, today, even as at the time of His life below. Then, "He came
   unto His own and His own received Him not." Let not that be said over,
   again, and said of us who are, in a more special sense, His own than
   were His brothers and sisters according to the flesh. "Be you not
   forgetful to entertain strangers" is a Gospel command--but be you
   especially eager to entertain your Lord! Shall your Lord ever say to
   any of you who are called Christians, "I was a stranger, and you took
   Me not in"? Oh, no! Let us invite Him, beg Him, entreat Him, constrain
   Him to abide with us for His own dear sake--and let us give Him, in our
   warm hearts, the best entertainment that we can!

   Surely we never received such a guest, before, and another such we
   shall never see again! Men are willing to give up their estates and
   houses for a time to entertain royalty--they reckon them to be
   increased in value when once a monarch

   has sojourned in them--and shall not we be more than willing to open
   wide our hearts, minds and homes, that Jesus may enter and be
   entertained by us as the King of kings? There is something, then, to be
   learned from companions likely to part. May the Holy Spirit sweetly
   teach us!

   II. Now, I change the scene, and notice, next--THE GUEST NEEDING TO BE
   PRESSED. The guest is Jesus and He is about to go further. And He will
   go further unless they invite Him, yes, unless, according to the 29th
   verse, they constrain Him. It is a very strong word that, "they
   constrained Him." It is akin to the one which Jesus used when He said,
   "The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence." They not only invited Him,
   but they held Him, they grasped His hand, they tugged at His
   clothes--they said He should not go. They would not have it--the cold
   night should not accuse them of being churls. He should not go another
   yard along that dangerous road--they must have Him for a guest--and
   they would not take no for an answer!

   Let us remember why this Guest needs constraining, and the first
   thought is, He could not very well have tarried, otherwise. If I were a
   stranger and walked along the road with two persons who did not know
   me--if I were able to talk to them ever so instructively--I should not
   think of intruding into their house when the conversation was over! You
   never see anything in Jesus approaching roughness or want of
   delicacy--He exhibits the manners of the noblest Man that ever lived!
   He does not force His acquaintance upon any, but He goes where He is
   constrained. Besides, what pleasure could it have been for Him or for
   them for Him to have lodged in their house if He had not been wanted?
   Without a welcome, few of us would care to accept a lodging. Jesus,
   therefore, naturally, because the other thing was scarcely feasible,
   waited till He was asked and even pressed. And had they not constrained
   Him, He would have gone further.

   Remark that this is a characteristic of the Son of God at all times. I
   have not time, this morning, otherwise I could show you that all
   through the Old Testament as well as the New, when the Lord reveals
   Himself in any visible form, He has to be pressed before He will abide
   with any. The Lord came to Abraham and Abraham said, "My Lord, if now I
   have found favor in Your sight, pass not away, I pray You, from Your
   servant: let a little water, I pray You, be fetched, and wash Your
   feet, and rest Yourselves under the tree: and I will fetch a morsel of
   bread, and comfort Your hearts; after that You shall pass on: for
   therefore are You come to your servant" (Gen. 18:3-5). Abraham
   constrains these wondrous guests, or otherwise they will pass on!

   Look at chapter 19 and see what Lot did when two angels came to him.
   Even supposing these were nothing more than angels, they show the
   manners of the court of Heaven, so that it is an equally good
   illustration for me. He said, "Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray
   you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your
   feet, and you shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said,
   No; but we will abide in the street all night. And he pressed upon them
   greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house" (vs.
   2, 3). Joseph was, in this, a type of Jesus, for you know how slow he
   seemed to reveal himself to his brothers, though all the while he was
   full of love to them. To Moses the Lord said, "Let Me alone," and only
   by mighty pleading could the man of God prevail!

   When an angel came to Manoah and his wife, to tell them about Samson,
   we find that He had to be detained, or else He would have departed
   speedily. "And Manoah said unto the Angel of the Lord, I pray You, let
   us detain You, until we shall have made ready a kid for You." (Judges
   13:15, 16). You see, the heavenly messenger needed to be detained, or
   He would have gone at once. And then comes in that instance of which
   you have already thought, when the angel said to Jacob, "Let Me go, for
   the day breaks. And he said, I will not let You go, except You bless
   me." It is clear that the Lord will be entreated of by the house of
   Israel to do good things for them. We shall have to cry--

   "In vain You struggle to get free,

   I never will unloose my hold!

   Are You the Man that died for me?

   The secret of Your love unfold:

   Wrestling, I will not let You go,

   Till I Your name, Your nature know.

   I know You, Savior, who You are,

   Jesus, the feeble sinner's Friend;

   Nor will You with the night depart,

   But stay and love me to the end;

   Your mercies never shall remove

   Your nature and Your name is Love." We know that our Lord had a shy
   habit--He often withdrew Himself--and the multitude sought after Him.
   He walked upon the sea and they in the vessel saw Him and He would have
   gone by them, but they cried out to Him. The Syro-Phoenician woman, who
   sought for the healing of her daughter, found Him, at first, very cold
   to her, and only by the greatest faith did she win her desire! He
   needed earnest pressure before He yielded to her request.

   The blind men cried unto Him for sight, but He passed on till louder
   and louder went up their piteous cries, and they held Him, for Jesus
   stood still. The nobleman, when he came about his son, pleaded with
   tears till he cried, "Lord, come down before my child dies." It has
   been often so with our gracious Lord. He would not come until He saw
   that the desire for Him was intense. He gives us two parables--one
   tells us of the man in bed who must be awakened with many a knock and
   many a call before he would rise to give bread to his friend who sought
   it. The other parable is that of the unjust judge who must be wearied
   by the woman's importunate entreaties before he will vindicate her
   cause. From all this you see it is the Master's habit to hold back till
   He is pressed and constrained.

   If we must give a reason for this I would remind you of the jealousy of
   His Character. He is jealous of our love! He says, "Give Me your
   heart," and so He pauses a while that He may see that we love Him and
   prize His benefits. Of old the Father said, "The Lord your God is a
   jealous God," and Jesus, the Incarnation of the Divine Love, has told
   us that, "love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave" and,
   therefore, it is that He will not give His company to those who have no
   heart for it. You shall not have His smiles if the smiles of the world
   will do as well. If union with worldlings will please you as much as
   union with Him, you shall have none of His company! It is only when you
   languish for Him, sigh for Him and cry for Him that He will abide with
   you!

   He has another reason and that is, His anxiety to do us good! He wisely
   wishes that we should value the mercy which He gives by being led to
   consider what a case we should be in if He did not give it. He stirs up
   our prayers and then answers them--and so we get a double blessing--the
   prayers, themselves, being of much service to us, and then the answer
   being all the more a blessing! It was good to these two disciples to be
   allowed to be hospitable. It was good for them to rouse themselves to
   entreat Him. They valued the company of Jesus all the more when they
   had diligently persuaded Him to sit at their table and partake of their
   simple meal.

   Now, Beloved, let us look at Jesus in this light, and say within
   ourselves, "I am fearful lest I should do anything to excite His
   jealousy. And I am anxious to show my eager longing for His Presence
   lest He should think me unkind. I would not make Him 'go further' and
   leave me, but I would hold Him fast, constraining Him to abide with
   me."

   III. I have said that here was a Guest who needed pressing--there will
   be no necessity to enlarge upon the remark that here was A GUEST WORTH
   PRESSING. He was, indeed, worth pressing when we consider what He had
   done for them. He had given them comfort and instruction and He was
   worth detaining if only for that. Had they known Him they would have
   felt still more that they could not let Him go. Would they not have
   borne Him on their shoulders into the house and said, "Good Master, we
   cannot think of letting You go, for You are He whom our souls love--our
   Master and our Lord--over whom we have been mourning as one dead, and
   lo, You are alive"? So much were they indebted to Him that they could
   not fail to make Him their guest!

   They must press Him again, for how comfortless the house would have
   been without Him! I think I see those two disciples sitting down to
   their meal, supposing the Master had gone on. Suddenly, one would have
   remembered, and said, "My heart feels heavy, now that He is gone." And
   the other would have said, "How came it that we let Him go? Why did we
   not entreat Him to stay the night with us?" Their meal would have half
   choked them! They would have gone to their beds and tossed about
   throughout a sleepless night if they had failed in hospitality to Him.
   This is what has happened to some of us when we have carelessly let our
   Lord slip away--we have been like widows who have newly lost their
   husbands--sore in heart and desolate.

   "Should the children of the bridegroom fast?" Not while the bridegroom
   is with them! But if he is taken from them, then shall they fast.
   Better to have been outside in the open air, or to have gone further
   with the unknown Traveler, than to have been comfortably housed and to
   have treated Him ill. He was a Guest worth constraining to remain when
   we think of the vacuum there would have been if He had gone further!
   Besides, we know what they did not then know, that this unknown One
   would make Himself known to them, as He has done to us. Knowing Him,
   now, as they knew Him

   afterwards in the breaking of the bread, we ought to feel, we must
   feel, we do feel, that we cannot, will not let Him go, but will detain
   Him, for He is Christ our Lord!

   I spoke at the beginning to some here who have never known our Lord and
   yet He has been very close to them frequently, in hearing sermons and
   the like. Dear Friends, I earnestly beseech you to receive Christ as a
   Stranger, and you shall soon know Him as a Friend! You only know of my
   Lord, that He makes you have the heartburn every now and then. And when
   we talk about Him, you go home very uncomfortable. How I wish that you
   knew Him better! Oh, that you would entertain Him, for then you would
   know His excellence! Bid Him come into your heart and He will be
   infinitely more to you than He is now.

   You have no idea what He is. He seems a well-spoken Friend, but He will
   prove to be a Brother! He promises to instruct you, but He will love
   you, enrich you, and glorify you. Oh dear child of God, not yet
   well-instructed, your eyes are weak and you see not Jesus as you shall
   see Him! Still, I pray you heartily entertain the Savior, even if your
   eyes are blind. Take Him in and let Him lodge with you, and you will
   know more and yet more of Him! You will know most of Him as you break
   your bread to the hungry, and so break it to Him. You will know more as
   you break the bread at the Communion Table and so commune with Him.
   Only remember, He is a Guest worth pressing, and be sure you do your
   best humbly, but earnestly, to detain Him!

   IV. I close by telling you of AN ARGUMENT WITH WHICH TO HOLD HIM. Here
   it is in the text. "They constrained Him, saying, Abide with us, for it
   is toward evening, and the day is far spent." My first way of using
   this text does not commend itself to my judgment, but yet it is
   necessary. All the commentators and preachers I have ever met with
   suppose that these disciples meant, by this argument, that it was
   dreary for themselves to be alone and, therefore, for their own comfort
   and protection, they begged the stranger to remain. I do not believe it
   for a moment! Still, that would have been a good argument with the
   tender-hearted Savior and if you and I cannot attain to anything else,
   let us use that plea.

   It is toward evening with many of you. You are in affliction and the
   shadows thicken. Your light has departed and you are afraid. Sorrows
   come on like the darkness of night. You know not what approaches--you
   are heavy of heart. Ah, then that is a blessed prayer--

   "Fast falls the eventide! The darkness thickens: Lord, abide with me."

   You can bear any trouble with Christ. No adversities shall hurt you, no
   afflictions shall grieve your spirit if He is with you. Pray,
   therefore, this prayer, and no longer fear as you enter into the cloud.
   Or it may be that some of you are falling into depression of spirit
   through the loss of the Light of God's Countenance. You are not as
   joyful a Christian as you used to be. The high felicities of your
   spirit have burned down and all is dim. Now is the time to say, "Lord,
   abide with me. If I have no joy, still let me have Yourself." It is a
   blessed thing when a Believer does not set his affection so much upon
   the joy of the Lord as upon the Lord of his joy--when he says not only,
   "Lord, I will rejoice in You while You smile," but cries with Job,
   "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." Better to have to do with
   a killing God than to have God gone!

   So, cry, "Lord, if I never get a smile from You; if I am never again
   cheered and comforted by You; if I never sing a hymn of gladness, yet
   still abide with me! Be near, even if I know it not." It was a
   beautiful expression of David, who often asked the Lord to shine upon
   him, when he said, "In the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice." As
   much as to say--If I have no light from God's face, I will be glad to
   be hidden beneath His wings. Abide with me, then, even if my reason
   almost fails me, and my darkened soul dreads a yet more tremendous
   night. Abide with me, O Lord, even should my sorrow seal my eyes in
   death. "Abide with me" is a blessed prayer for those Believers who are
   getting aged. With them it is toward evening and the day is far spent.
   Now should they cry, "Abide with me." Then will you sweetly go to your
   chamber and fall into your last, most blessed sleep, and obtain the
   fulfillment of yours prayer that you may be forever with the Lord.

   I have used the text in this way because everybody has used it so, but
   I believe that these disciples meant it in quite another sense. They
   used the argument to detain Christ because it was evening, for His
   sake--because the night was coming on and they could not think of His
   being out in it. They knew how heavy the Eastern dews are and so they
   pressed

   Him with this--"Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is
   far spent." Let each one of us use that argument with our Lord even
   now--Lord, the world has no entertainment for You! Unbelieving hearts
   give You no shelter. The self-righteous repel You from their doors. The
   worldly see no beauty in You; carnal hearts refuse You; every house is
   locked against You! Therefore come in and abide with me. Here is
   lodging for You! Come in, Blessed One, and stay with me. If You lack
   shelter in king's palaces, abide with me! If there is no room for You
   in the inn, yet come in here and find Yourself at home, for I shall
   count myself greatly honored by receiving You. Therefore, dear Master,
   abide with me.

   How we ought to long to cheer the Blessed One with our love because He
   is still so despised and rejected everywhere else. Everywhere else they
   treat Him ill. O do not let Him be wounded in the house of His friends!
   If He had 50 houses to go to, I might say, "Lord, they can give You
   better entertainment than lies in my power." But when it is "toward
   evening" and no other door is open, Lord come into my poor cottage! I
   will set all that I have before You and be Your willing servant. That
   is the plea!

   Another form of the plea is this. The ages are growing old and dark.
   What a plea that is for the Church to put up now, for the coming of her
   Lord. "O Lord, it is toward evening, the world's sun is setting. It is
   nearly 1,900 years since you ascended and still, the world lies in the
   Wicked One! Lord, come to Your Church! Come and abide with her, for as
   the world grows old, good Master, a chill night comes on and the love
   of many waxes cold--and there are some that turn aside who once ran
   well. Dire evils walk abroad in the dark and blasphemy and rebuke are
   rife! Good Master, come unto Your Church and dwell in her, and find,
   there, Your home!

   "And the night of all nights is coming on, even the end of the world.
   We know not when, but we know we are getting nearer to it every day.
   Earth's day is far spent. Her day of mercy comes toward its eventide
   and the night draws on, therefore, Master, come and abide with us, that
   we may win the world for you. Come, come that we may convert the
   heathen to Your Cross and that You may have them for Your inheritance.
   It is with Your Church that You will do this! Come, then, and abide
   with her ministers and her missionaries, and all her living membership,
   that yet the prophecies may be accomplished and Your purpose may be
   fulfilled! And Your reward may be the salvation of Your own."

   Is not that a good missionary text, after all, a blessed prayer with
   which to begin this missionary week--"Abide with us for it is toward
   evening, and the day is far spent"? In the Romish church there is a
   chant which they use from Easter to the day of Ascension, and though I
   care nothing for liturgies or anything of the sort, yet it is certainly
   a suggestive canticle. The first line of the chant is--

   "Abide with us. Hallelujah."

   And the next is--

   "For it is toward evening, And the day is far spent. Hallelujah." With
   that I close. May we use that argument well, until our Lord shall, in
   very deed, abide with us!

My Solace in My Affliction

   (No. 1656)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Forever, O Lord, Your Word is settled in Heaven. Your faithfulness is
   unto all generations: You have established the earth and it abides.
   They continue this day according to Your ordinances: for all are Your
   servants. Unless Your Law had been my delights, I should then ha ve
   perished in my affliction." Psalm119:89-92.

   EVEN in those Psalms which are not associated with any particular
   chapter of history, we can often trace out the trail of the writer's
   experience and track his soul through its wanderings. His reflections
   become vivid with intense reality. The meditation now before us is
   evidently prompted by some event deeply carved on the writer's memory.
   "Unless Your Law had been my delights, I should then have perished in
   my affliction." We know nothing of the time or circumstance when the
   heart was terrified, when the nerves were shaken, when the weakness of
   nature asserted itself--the veil is wisely drawn over the sharp pains
   or sullen griefs that bowed the sufferer down and we are simply solaced
   with a song celebrating his deliverance out of all his troubles and
   fears. Possibly his affliction was long, but certainly it reached a
   crisis so perilous that his life then trembled in the balance! He was
   then ripe for destruction, ready to have perished.

   Moreover, it is noteworthy that whatever his trial may have been,
   whether it was a sickness or a disaster, or any other manner of
   adversity, he refers to it as his own--he calls it, "my affliction." It
   would ill become us, therefore, to pry into the cause or fashion of his
   grief, or to ask any further questions. Quite likely I may be
   addressing some dear child of God who is vexed with an affliction so
   personal and so peculiar that he feels it to be "his own," and would
   deem it an intrusion for another to interfere. Let us not intrude, for
   we should only increase the grief by our enquiries.

   "My affliction" is an expression that bears a marked emphasis and has a
   tone entirely its own. I do not know whether I am more struck with its
   pathos or its reticence. At the sound of such words, a stranger might
   well be touched with pity, but a friend, however sympathizing, would
   shrink from prying into the secrets of a heart that so delicately
   conceals its own bitterness. The one and only thing that the Psalmist
   was eager to tell us was the prescription that soothed his pains and
   sustained his spirits. On mature reflection, he is confident that he
   would have perished under that affliction if it had not been for
   certain comfortable and delightful reflections concerning God's Word.
   You and I may, at any time, be exposed to the same mental or spiritual
   depression, through one or other of those manifold sorrows which enter
   so largely into Christian life. There are plenty of miry places on the
   way to Heaven and so it will be our wisdom to diligently enquire how
   this good man passed through them.

   I like to hear how any godly man has been comforted, for it comforts
   me. I take a deep interest in the simple tale of any humble prisoner
   whose bonds the Lord has loosed. And I feel it a choice pleasure to
   chime in with songs of thanksgiving which come from the lips of
   grateful suppliants whose cries the Lord has heard. Observe that the
   Psalmist appeals to certain facts which he remembered. "Forever, O
   Lord, Your Word is settled in Heaven. Your faithfulness is unto all
   generations: You have established the earth, and it abides," etc. And
   then he refers to certain delights which he experienced in reviewing
   these facts -"Unless Your Law had been my delights, I should have
   perished in my affliction."

   I. Here, then, we have strong consolation IN CERTAIN FACTS WHICH HE
   REMEMBERED. Fly to the mountains when the enemy invades the land. Hide
   in the strongholds of your God!

   1. Our first comfort is the eternal existence of God which is implied
   in the continuance of His faithfulness and power. "The Lord lives" is
   the plea of souls harassed and haunted by foes without and fears
   within. Observe, I pray you, that there is nothing casual or accidental
   in the tone of the Psalmist's meditation, as if some stray thought had
   darted a ray of light into the mind of one who was dreary and downcast.
   His joy is not like a flower that blooms in the desert, or a bird that
   chirps merrily amidst the frost of winter--he has abundant and even
   overflowing causes for joy! His confidence runs

   on the grand old classic lines which Inspiration has hallowed. When
   Moses was appalled by the frailty of man, he uttered his majestic ode
   to the eternity of God. "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all
   generations."

   So here, the eternal existence of God is the first fact to which the
   afflicted saint clings. According to the most eminent scholars, the
   opening sentence should be read--"Forever You are, O Lord; Your Word is
   settled in Heaven." The second verse, as you may notice, is divided
   into two sentences, and the poetic parallelism requires a like
   arrangement in this verse, if the poetic rule is carried out. But this
   would not form two stanzas unless we read the first four words as a
   distinct sentence--"Forever, O Lord, You are." Whether this revision is
   warranted or not does not matter, for, as I have already said, the fact
   is implied in the wording of the authorized version. God is. He is
   forever the same and His years are throughout all generations. This is
   a very simple Truth of God--who but a madman or a fool ever doubted it?

   If there is a God, He must be self-existent and eternal. But it is from
   simple things that sweetest consequences flow. Bread is simple
   enough--you do not require some eminent chief of the kitchen to teach
   you the art of making bread. But see what multitudes of people are fed
   upon that simple article of food! And so the simplest Truth of God is
   the most precious, for it sustains many more than that daintier form of
   Truth which may be only suitable for men of strong minds or of great
   experience in the things of God. In the song of Moses--that song which
   is linked with the song of the Lamb-- we have an apostrophe that
   language could hardly surpass. "Who is like unto You, O Lord, among the
   gods (or mighty ones)? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful
   in praises, doing wonders?"

   To what lofty heights of expression did the holy Prophets often rise in
   proclaiming the grandeur of the Lord's being, the magnitude of His
   works, the sovereignty of His will and the faithfulness of His promises
   to His people! And yet the wealth of imagery that Isaiah or Ezekiel
   could call up, or the melting tones that Jeremiah could utter, can but
   faintly display the excellence of Him that fills all in all! They
   rehearse His praise to whom, alone, all worship is due, in words that
   swell and sound forth like the music of the spheres. They assail the
   heathen idolatry which offered its incense to engraved images, or they
   expose the heartless treachery that withheld homage from the true God.
   They denounce the unbelief which limited the Holy One of Israel by
   distrusting His words. In any of these cases, if we lend them our ears,
   they succeed in elevating our hearts from the groveling thoughts of our
   fleeting life to the infinite perfection of Jehovah's essential Deity,
   of whom (to accommodate the idea of His everlasting existence to our
   tiny computations) we are told "that one day is as a thousand years,
   and a thousand years as one day."

   My Brothers and Sisters, we are compassed about with God on every side.
   In Him we live, move and have our being. His self-existent might is our
   never-failing mercy. Observe, I pray you, that this simple Truth of God
   is the most sublime fact which the mind of a rational creature can
   aspire to lay hold of. God lives--lives as God! Get a grip of this
   vital reality and it will send a glow of health through every faculty
   of yours soul! "Believe in the Lord, your God; so shall you be
   established: believe His Prophets; so shall you prosper." And unless
   God is in all your thoughts you cannot be a godly man! Nothing happens
   to the Lord by chance. What can threaten His existence, thwart His
   purpose, weaken His power, dim the clearness of His eyes, diminish the
   tenderness of His heart, or distract the wisdom of His judgment? "You
   are the same, and of Your years there is no end."

   Then remember, child of God, you are a sheep that can never lose its
   Shepherd. You are a child that can never lose its Father. "I will not
   leave you orphans," said Jesus, and therein He did but reveal the
   Eternal Father's heart. In direst straits we still have a Father in
   Heaven! When a widow, who had long been inconsolable, sat moaning for
   the loss of her husband, her little child plucked her by her gown, and
   said, "Mother, is God dead?" That question served to rebuke the
   mother's fretfulness and to remind her that she was not without a
   Guardian and Friend. "Your Maker is your Husband; the Lord of Hosts is
   His name." It opened up to her a well of refreshment, which, like Hagar
   in the wilderness, she had not before been able to see. Listen, child
   of God--you can lose your goods, but you cannot lose your God! Like
   Jonah, you can see your gourd withered; but your God remains! You may
   lose your land, but not your Lord; your savings, but not your Savior!
   Even if it came to the worst and you were left, awhile, as one forsaken
   of God, Himself, yet still you would not lose Him, for, like the Lord
   Jesus on the Cross, you would still call Him, "My God, my God."

   "The Lord is my portion," says my soul--a portion that never can be
   alienated--upon which there is the entail of an irreversible decree
   that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie,
   we who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,
   might have strong consolation. He lives! He reigns! This God is our God
   and He shall be our Guide even unto death. Yes, it is a simple fact
   that God is, but it is a fact that may often recur to us with singular
   freshness.

   I met an eminent servant of God one day in the street, a man whose
   name, were I to mention it, you would all honor. He was in a rather
   gloomy and desponding mood that morning and in the course of our
   conversation he told me that he believed the powers of evil in this
   country would get the upper hand and that Christianity would be almost
   stamped out, he feared, partly by Romanism and partly by infidelity.
   And that in all probability I should live to see the streets of London
   run with blood while anarchy would riot as it did in the first French
   Revolution. He went on at such a rate that I felt bound to remonstrate
   with him. So I told him that I was not easily scared by such evil
   prognostications, for I was persuaded that God was not dead. This is
   our firm rock of hope--the reins of government are in the hands of the
   living God--and the devil cannot frustrate His decrees, nor can events
   baffle His will!

   When Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles and the people of Israel were
   gathered together against the Holy Child Jesus whom the Lord had
   anointed, how little could they effect! They had it all their own way,
   or, at least, they thought they had. How much did they really
   accomplish with their willful counsels and their wicked hands? Hear it
   distinctly. They (these emissaries of Satan) did whatever God's hand
   and God's counsel determined before to be done! And thus it will always
   be! The adversaries of the Lord are exceedingly fierce, but you and I
   who believe in God can afford to smile at their folly. If it must be
   so, let the powers of darkness have all the vantage ground they
   seek--and they will reap all the greater defeat. "He that sits in the
   heavens shall laugh. The Lord shall have them in derision. Yet have I
   set My king upon My holy hill of Zion."

   The Church, they tell us, is in danger. That depends upon whose church
   it is! But if it is the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, the gates of
   Hell shall not prevail against her. Let us, in this, then, be joyous
   and confident! If Luther could sing when the battle had but just
   begun--while yet the demon of the seven hills had temporal sway--why
   should you and I be hanging our harps on the willows, now that the
   fight has made the dragon bleed? Come, let us sing unto the Lord, for
   He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and his rider He has thrown into
   the sea. And as for these Amalekites, that meet us on the road and
   would arrest our progress, let us, like Jehoshaphat, appoint singers
   unto the Lord to go before our army and meet them with hallelujahs! Let
   us sing--Arise, O God, and make Your enemies flee before You like chaff
   before the wind! Yes, let them be as the fat of rams burnt upon the
   altar, for You, Lord, are King, and You shall reign forever and ever!
   This is a flowing well of comfort.

   2. Closely allied to the fact of God's eternal Being is this other fact
   of the immutability of His Word. "Your Word is settled in Heaven." The
   truth of the proposition will occur to you as simple and obvious. "Thus
   says the Lord, the Heaven is My Throne, and the earth is My footstool."
   His Word is settled in Heaven and issued from Heaven, the seat of His
   government, and it cannot be altered on earth, this distant colony of
   His empire! We refer to God's Word, therefore, in grievous difficulties
   with great confidence, because we know that every statement it contains
   is reliable. God's Word can never change. It is established.

   Some persons have no settled residence. They are always moving to and
   fro, restless, finding no anchorage. But God's Word is not fixed on
   earth where things are always on the move--it is settled in Heaven
   among the infinities and eternities that change not. "Forever, O Lord,
   Your Word is settled in Heaven." The design and purpose of God are
   fixed, not fickle. He knows what He intends. You and I often begin with
   a design from which we are bound to deviate as we see something that
   would be better, or as we see that our better thing is not attainable
   and we are obliged to be content with something inferior. But in God's
   case there can be no defect of judgment which would require amendment
   and there can be no defect of power which would drive Him from His
   first determination. God has a plan, depend upon it! It were an insult
   to the supreme intellect if we supposed that He worked at random,
   without plan or method.

   To some of us it is a Truth which we never doubt, that God has one
   boundless purpose which embraces all things-- both things which He
   permits and things which He ordains. Without, for a moment, denying the
   freedom of the human will, we still believe that the supreme wisdom
   foresees, also, the curious twisting of the human will and overrules
   all for His own ends. God knows and numbers all the inclinations and
   devices of men--and His plan, in its mighty sweep, takes them all into
   account! From that plan He never swerves. What He has resolved to do He
   will do. The settled purpose of His heart shall stand forever sure. Of
   what use could the opposition of angels or of men be when Omnipotence
   asserts its supremacy? As you walk down your garden on an autumn
   morning, the spiders have spun their webs across the path, but you
   scarcely know it, for as you move along, the threads vanish before you.

   So is it with every scheme, however skillfully contrived, that would
   arrest the fulfillment of the Divine purpose! The will of God must be
   done! Without the semblance of effort, He molds all events into His
   chosen form. In the sphere of

   mind as well as in that of matter, His dominion is absolute! One man
   cannot immediately operate on the will of another man so as to change
   its course, although intermediately he may propound reasons which, by
   their effect on the understanding, may completely alter the inclination
   of His fellow creature. But this is a true Proverb--"The king's heart
   is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: He turns it
   wherever He wills."

   God can bend the thoughts of men as easily as we can lay on the pipes
   and turn the water into any cistern we choose. His purpose is settled
   forever in Heaven! So, too, are His Covenant and His Plan. Brothers and
   Sisters, I could imagine God changing His mode of procedure, but I
   could not imagine His changing His Covenant! He has entered into
   Covenant with Christ on our behalf--the Sacrifice that makes it valid
   has been slain--and now the Covenant is ordered in all things and sure!
   Every jot and tittle of it is signed and sealed and ratified by the
   death and the Resurrection of our glorious Surety and blessed
   Representative! From that Covenant God will never turn aside. The
   Covenant of Works we broke, but God kept it, for He did what He said He
   would do.

   The Covenant of Grace we cannot break, for it is made with Another, on
   our behalf, who has already fulfilled it, so that the Covenant of Grace
   stands, now, towards the saints without an, "if," or, "but," or
   "perhaps," and consists simply in unconditional promises of, "I will,"
   and, "you shall." Read that Covenant for yourselves and see. Whether
   you choose to take the copy of it in Ezekiel, or the copy of it
   presented by the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews, there it
   stands--a Covenant without conditions, enduring forever, never to be
   changed! Oh, how I rejoice in the sure mercies of David! "This is as
   the waters of Noah unto Me," says the Lord, "for as I have sworn that
   the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn
   that I will not be angry with you, or rebuke you." Now, blessed be His
   name, the Covenant is settled in Heaven!

   Then there is another matter which is settled, namely, God's promise
   and the power to carry it out. I spoke of the promise being settled
   because it is virtually a constituent element of the Covenant, but now
   I mean that Gospel promise which has been proclaimed to the sons of
   men. "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved"--that shall
   stand good throughout all generations. "He that believes in Him has
   everlasting life"--that shall always be true. "Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out"--that shall never alter till the day of doom.
   God will not reverse the things that have gone forth out of His lips!
   It was proclaimed by Christ, Himself! It was testified by His Apostles.
   It was ratified by the descent of the Holy Spirit! The promises of the
   Gospel are settled in Heaven and, therefore, the preaching of the
   Gospel is full of power among the sons of men.

   Go and preach it, dear Brothers! Go and tell it, dear Sisters! Never be
   afraid that you will make a mistake if you proclaim free Grace and
   dying love! God has not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth.
   The salvation of souls shall be the evidence of the efficacy of the
   Gospel till every blood-bought one is brought by its power to Jesus'
   feet. There is no change in the charge that is committed to our
   keeping--"Your Word is settled in Heaven." Moreover, the doctrine of
   the Gospel as well as the promise of the Gospel is settled in Heaven. I
   do not know where I shall drift if I once leave the old channel to wind
   about among sandbanks. Certain of my Brothers delight to sail down a
   river which has neither buoys nor fixed lights, but plenty of
   ever-shifting sands! They do not steer according to any chart, but
   according to their own heaving of the lead, from time to time, and very
   heavy lead it is to heave!

   They say that they are thinking out their doctrines! I would be greatly
   sorry to have to think out the road to Heaven without the guiding star
   of Heaven's Grace or the map of the Word of God! Not Gospel preachers
   but Gospel makers these men aspire to be. And their message comes
   forth, not as the Gospel of the Grace of God, but as the gospel of the
   imagination of men--a gospel concocted in their own kitchen--not taught
   them by the Holy Spirit! It is the reverse of being "settled in
   Heaven." It is not even settled in the mind of its inventor! I pity the
   hearers, as well as the preachers, of a precarious gospel! That which I
   preached to you in the beginning of my ministry, I shall preach to you,
   by God's Grace, till this tongue shall be silent in the grave! I know
   the doctrines better, but I know no better doctrines!

   There are certain things indelibly impressed on my mind, of a surety
   fixed, definite, true and beyond doubt. As to ideas that are dubious,
   concerning which we need to be diffident--I leave my Brothers to
   discuss them. Sentiments fluctuate so constantly in this 19th Century
   that I suppose we shall soon require to have barometers to show us the
   variations of doctrine as well as the prospects of the weather! We
   shall have to consult quarterly reviews to see what style of religious
   thought is predominant--and then we shall have to accommodate our
   sermons to the dictum of the last wise man who has chosen to make a
   special fool of himself! As for myself, I shall continue to be
   unfashionable and abide where I

   am. "Stick in the mud," says somebody. "Standing on the Rock," say I!
   No, if you will--grown to the Immovable Rock--not to be turned aside.

   If this Gospel is a lie, I grieve that I ever preached it and I will
   never preach it again. If it is true, truth is not a thing of almanacs
   and quarterlies. If true in the year, "two," it is as true in the year,
   "1882." And if it is not true today, it never was and never will be
   true, for the Truth of God does not come and go and be and cease to be.
   Fall you back, O simple hearts, upon this blessed fact--God's Word is
   "settled in Heaven." It cannot be settled at Oxford, or settled at
   Cambridge, or at any other university! But it is settled in Heaven. Go
   to Heaven's Book and read Heaven's Word under the teaching of Heaven's
   own Spirit. And you shall go from strength to strength in the
   knowledge--not of what may be true, but of what is true, having the
   Revelation of God to confirm it--an authority from which there can be
   no appeal!

   3. The third thing is the faithfulness of the fulfillment of that Word
   of God. "Forever, O Lord, Your Word is settled in Heaven. Your
   faithfulness is unto all generations." Those men who have trusted God's
   Word in any generation have always found it true. In Apostolic times,
   or further back than that, in David's age, in the era of Moses, in the
   time of Abraham, in the days of Noah, in the life of Abel--whoever has
   trusted in God--has found that He has heard prayer, that He has been
   the Rewarder of all them that diligently seek Him!

   The Covenant, as I have already said, does not change, and the Truth of
   God does not change, and though the generations greatly differ in the
   judgment of men, I greatly question whether God thinks them different.
   One generation is as like another as successive waves of the sea. We
   think we grow much wiser, but it is not a very strong proof that we are
   wiser because we think we are! I very much question all this
   fiddle-faddle about the progress of the 19th Century. True, we rush
   over the country by steam instead of traveling by broad-wheeled wagons,
   and we get smashed up all the more readily! We now go all round the
   world to buy a bit of bread--we used to grow it in our own fields--and
   it was just as good, then, as it is now that it comes from afar.

   There were good people then. There are good people now. I will not
   decry whatever progress has been made in machinery and the arts and so
   on. I thank God for it all, but about the improvement in
   ourselves--that is the point! I imagine that we bear a striking
   resemblance to our fathers. When I read the story of the children of
   Israel in the wilderness, I think I see their sins and their follies,
   their murmurs and complaints repeated in our own lives. But whether or
   not the race has changed, there has been no change in God's dealings
   with the race. Whenever a Believer has rested in Him, He has fulfilled
   His Word to that Believer to the letter. This has always been the rule
   of the Kingdom of God--"According to your faith, so is it unto you."

   Were I to enlarge upon all the vicissitudes through which God's
   servants have passed, we should have to come to the one conclusion,
   "Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the Lord delivers him
   out of them all." That is so today as it was thousands of years ago. O
   Beloved, this is the mercy--that God is still faithful! When I used to
   hear my grandfather tell of the faithfulness of God to him, my young
   heart was encouraged to trust in God. When I have heard my father tell
   of the faithfulness of God to him, I have been strengthened in my
   confidence in my father's God. But I can tell the same tales, myself
   and, perhaps, I can record more instances than they of God's goodness
   to those that put their trust in Him. It will be the same with our
   children and with our children's children.

   O tried Brothers and Sisters, the Lord will be faithful to you as He
   has been to me! The Lord will not fail you. Therefore be not
   discouraged. As your days, so shall your strength be. Underneath you
   are the everlasting arms. You shall conquer, however hot the fight may
   become. Only stay yourself upon the Lord and wait patiently for Him.
   Fret not yourself, in anything, to do evil, for you shall be delivered
   and God shall be glorified in you.

   4. But I must pass on to the next fact worth considering, and that is
   the perpetuity of the Word of God in Nature. To this the Psalmist
   alludes in the following words--"You have established the earth and it
   abides. They continue this day according to Your ordinances, for all
   are Your servants." By the Word of God were the heavens made and it is
   by His Word that all things consist. We talk of the force of
   gravitation and the laws of Nature, but in very deed the one force in
   Nature is that God spoke. The Word of the Lord is the power by which
   all things hold together and remain in their places.

   Look at the earth. We talk of the pillars of it--the columns upon which
   it leans--but what does it rest upon? Our modern science does not
   weaken the point of the text, it rather strengthens it. The earth rests
   upon nothing! There it is, floating in space, and yet it has never
   drifted from its place or turned aside from its proper orbit! There are
   little quivers within its own bosom, but it does not rush away from the
   place where God ordained it to be. It continues its course

   around the sun with immutable fidelity. This world is rather larger
   than you are and requires more power to keep it in its place than is
   requisite to keep you in your place. Yet there it is! Shall not the
   Lord hold up His servant and keep him from wandering? All the machinery
   in the world could not turn the globe on its axis or move it in its
   orbit. I suppose that no angelic force would be adequate to bring about
   such results as God accomplishes simply by His will. He establishes the
   world and it abides.

   Let us be confident, then. Whenever God means to break His Word and
   change His ordinances, we may expect to find this earth go steaming
   into the sun, or else it will rush far off into space, nobody knows
   where. But while it keeps its place, what have you and I to worry
   about? Is it not the sign that the Lord will keep us, also? Has He kept
   the stars, which are the major? Shall He not much more keep us, who are
   the minor? What are we but small specks, grains of dust things scarcely
   to be seen? And yet we talk about the great power of God that we shall
   need to keep us in our place! Let us cease from doubt as we see this
   huge world kept like a sapphire in its golden setting by the Divine
   hands. Nor, Brothers and Sisters, is it this world alone, vast though
   it may seem to us, yet a little planet amidst the larger spheres! The
   Lord upholds all worlds comprehended in one vast system. "They continue
   this day according to Your ordinances."

   Every star maintains its place. "One sun by day, by night ten thousand
   shine," yet these constellations and all other creations of God's hands
   observe, each one, the ordinance of Heaven! God does not swerve from
   His own statutes, nor does He suffer the shining hosts to break their
   ranks. They may not rush about in wild confusion. They are the
   sentinels of Heaven. He calls them all by name, as He musters and
   marshals their serried ranks. Are they not all His servants, waiting at
   His feet as maidens attend their mistress? They all do His bidding!
   Ought not this cheer our hearts and inspire us with courage? If the
   heavenly bodies--as we are known to call those inanimate creatures of
   the Most High--are upheld by His power and disposed of by His wisdom,
   why should we discredit the Omnipotence which preserves our souls, or
   the Omniscience which orders our steps? If yon arch stands without
   buttress, cannot my faith rest on the promise, though no means of
   support are visible?

   Those mighty orbs to which we have been referring are under God's Law
   and subject to the Divine statutes--alike in respect to the motions
   they perform and to time influence they produce. All the creatures obey
   their Maker except man! There is no rebellion, to our knowledge,
   anywhere in the universe except among fallen angels and fickle mortals
   like ourselves. What, then, am I troubled about? Opposing forces cannot
   injure me. If God wills, He can send a squadron of angels to help me.
   He can bid the stars in their courses fight for me if it is necessary.
   All are His servants. The perpetuity of the Laws of Nature is a proof
   of the continuance of the Word of God. Strengthen your confidence as to
   things not seen by the steadfastness of the things that are--

   "His very Word of Grace is strong

   As that which built the skies!

   The voice that rolls the stars along

   Speaks all the promises."

   5. There is one other fact which I will only touch upon--the perpetuity
   of the Word of God in experience. "Unless," said the Psalmist, "Your
   Law had been my delights, I should then have perished in my
   affliction." We know, by experience, what he means. The trouble is a
   thing of the past, but the trembling is still present to our memory. We
   were mercifully delivered when we might have been utterly destroyed! My
   Brothers and Sisters, that same Word of God which has made the earth
   keep its place, has, up to now, been sufficient to make you keep your
   place. Some of you have passed through deep waters and yet you have not
   been drowned. I have a sympathy with young people, when they are
   doubting, because they have not seen the mighty works of which their
   fathers have told them. But if you have been sustained for 40 years in
   the wilderness, you ought to know the faithfulness of God--and I am
   ashamed of you when you get disheartened and discourage your Brethren.

   Most of all, I am ashamed of myself whenever I fall into despondency.
   Admiral Drake had been round the world. He had survived all sorts of
   storms and battles. One day, when coming up the Thames, he was caught
   in such an ugly wind that he was likely to be wrecked, and the admiral
   cried, "No, no, I have been round the world, and I do not intend to be
   drowned in a ditch." I want you to be animated by the same courage, for
   the Lord will not leave you! Surely He who has preserved you in all
   your previous distresses will not desert you in your present
   adversities! If you had not taken delight in God's Word, you would long
   ago have perished in your affliction! Look back upon the past, then,
   and see that God

   has been sufficient for you up till now. What reason have you for the
   suspicion that He will not befriend you even to the

   end?

   II. Having thus drawn your attention to the facts that the Psalmist
   recounts, I pass on, in the second place, to speak of THE DELIGHTS
   WHICH HE EXPERIENCED IN THE TIME OF HIS TROUBLE. "Man is born unto
   trouble, as the sparks fly upward," said one of Job's comforters,
   though I fear Job got little enough of comfort out of that sage
   reflection. Those troubles, however, that are common to men, are often
   the occasion of uncommon anguish to persons of sensitive nature. Some
   men and women receive a shock from which they never recover. They
   gradually droop and languish, health and happiness, alike, failing
   them. It is in such seasons of acute distress, when this world has no
   palliative to offer, that God's Word can minister infinite delights to
   soothe the distractions and heal the sorrows of the heart. These
   Psalms--most of them written by David, and the rest written by
   disciples of the David school--compass almost every conceivable form of
   adversity to which our poor suffering humanity is exposed.

   And there is another thing which I am sure you will find it sweet to
   muse upon. It is this--in all cases the sigh was turned into a song
   before it was admitted into the sacred calendar. This is a Law of the
   Kingdom of Heaven over which I linger with unspeakable delight! In
   fact, I can take a survey of your troubles, as well as of my own, with
   much composure when I perceive that they are all capable of being
   turned into joy! Our sympathies are continually stirred by the
   bereavements one and another of us are called to suffer. The ties of
   kindred and friendship are being broken all around. Each day has its
   obituary. This goes on from generation to generation. But the sharp
   pang of losing those we love is in no wise lightened by the fact that
   it is so general.

   Some of us today live in dread. Others have drawn down the blinds. He
   is gone on whom you leaned for succor. She has been snatched from your
   side, of whom you could say that none upon earth excelled her. Your
   nurslings, the flowers that bloomed around your hearth, have faded. I
   hear your desolate moan, but there is music not far off! All creatures
   are shadows, yet there is substance. At length you turn to these
   Scriptures and as you read, "The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock;
   and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation," your soul revives!
   You quit the treacherous sea and reach the solid rock when you repeat
   the words, "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations."
   Alas, dear mourner, your thoughts have wandered, like the dove from out
   the ark, over the watery waste. But now, again, Noah's hand encloses
   you. There you have calm and peaceful rest. Here is the pillow on which
   your aching head can lie at ease-- "You are the same; of Your years
   there is no end." Such delights can sustain a sinking soul.

   David was oftentimes in such a condition that everything seemed
   shifting and inconstant. Nothing about him was fixed. Those whom he had
   most trusted seemed to be his worst enemies. His fortunes changed. He
   was driven from the home of his father and from the palace of the king
   to wander in the wilderness and lodge in caves of the earth. And he
   became distrustful, at times, of his own destiny, for his heart was
   heavy, even though, once, he had been the happiest of the sons of men!
   Oh then, this was his delight--he fell back upon the eternal
   settlements! "Your Word is settled," said he. "I have no settlement. I
   have to go off to Gath to try and find a shelter, but every place seems
   to cast me out. The men of Keilah will deliver me up. I am hunted and
   harried by Saul. Nothing is settled for me, but O, my God, Your Word is
   settled." Now peace comes like a river to his spirit. His delights are
   in the Word of God and his heart is full of holy glee.

   So, too, sometimes he felt that his own faith failed him--and that is a
   desperate failure. When your vision is obscured and you walk in
   darkness, you are sorely molested by doubts and haunted with fears. You
   can believe nothing. You can hardly grip at anything that others
   believe in--this is terrible! Your own frailty, your own unfaithfulness
   to God, your own waywardness, your own fickleness disquiet you with
   feverish dreams and waste every particle of your strength. Then what a
   grand comfort it is to stand upon the Divine faithfulness-- "Your
   faithfulness, O God, is unto all generations. You have not changed."
   Oh, try, dear troubled ones, and may God the Holy Spirit help you in
   the trying, to get a hold of this delightful Truth of God! And while
   you mourn your own unfaithfulness, rejoice in the faithfulness of God
   and the immutability of His Covenant.

   David's Bible was of much smaller compass than ours, but there was one
   passage in it which I dare say he often read and deeply pondered. It
   was that which tells us how, when Abraham was lonely and desponding,
   "The Lord brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward Heaven
   and count the stars, if you are able to number them." How often have
   those ordinances of Heaven sent beams of light into the heart of the
   spiritual mariner while he has been heaving to and fro on the troubled
   sea of life! So did David look right up to the deep of Heaven and rest
   in God, the Stable and Abiding!

   Last of all, when none were his servants and all helpers failed
   him--when he was alone and none would do him homage, he found comfort
   in this thought--that all are God's servants, that all the powers of
   Nature wait upon the princes of the blood royal and do homage to the
   children of the King of kings! You are not poor! Your Father is rich!
   You are not deserted! God is with you! You are not without helpers! The
   angels are bid to keep watch about you! Oh, that I could touch the
   mourner's downcast eyes and let him see the mountain full of horses of
   fire and chariots of fire round about Elisha! Oh, that I could touch
   the heart of some of God's desponding servants and make them see how
   God is working for them, even now, and how surely they shall be helped!

   Perhaps you remember the story of a conversation between the
   burgomaster in Hamburg and holy Mr. Oncken when he first began to
   preach. The burgomaster said to him, "Do you see that little finger,
   Sir? While I can move that little finger, I will put the Baptists
   down." Mr. Oncken said, "With all respect to your little finger, Mr.
   Burgomaster, I would ask you another question. Do you see that great
   arm?" "No, I do not see it." "Just so," said Mr. Oncken, "but I do, and
   while that great arm moves, you cannot put us down! And if it comes to
   a conflict between your little finger and that great arm, I know how it
   will end."

   It was my great joy to see the burgomaster sitting in the Baptist
   Chapel, at Hamburg, among the audience that listened to my sermon at
   the opening of the new Chapel. The little finger had willingly given up
   its opposition and the great arm was made bare among us. Trust in the
   Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah there is everlasting strength!
   God bring us all to that, both saint and sinner, for Christ's sake.
   Amen.

My Hourly Prayer

   (No. 1657)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 26, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Hold You me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto Your
   statutes continually." Psalm 119:117.

   "HOLD You me up." This is no novelty as a prayer. We have met with it
   many a time. Another form of it lies hard by. Look at the verse
   immediately before the text and see it, there, in another shape.
   "Uphold me." I know of no difference in the two prayers, "Uphold me"
   and, "Hold me up." They are two notes from the same bell and they teach
   us that the Psalmist's mind was full of the petition, for he was
   conscious of his need of this upholding--this holding up. We use not
   vain repetitions as the heathen do and, therefore, when we have to
   express the same idea, it is natural to the living child of God to
   couch it in as fresh words as he can--and though it is the same note,
   yet he changes it, somewhat, and first cries, "Uphold me"--and then,
   "Hold me up."

   Of course I am now preaching only from the English text when I note
   these changes of expression, and I am rather giving illustrations than
   teaching by authority. Yet this is of authority--that we have need,
   continually, to cry for upholding Grace. You notice that in the first
   prayer, "Uphold me," it is for very life that he entreats for this
   upholding. "Uphold me according unto Your Word, that I may live: and
   let me not be ashamed of my hope." He feels that unless fresh Grace
   shall flow into his soul, his spiritual life must utterly fail. Do not
   forget this--let it give weight to your pleading. But in the second of
   the two verses--the one which makes our text--he looks for more than
   life as the result of upholding. He looks for safety, a life of
   unsullied holiness and consequent restfulness and security. "Hold You
   me up, and I shall be safe, and I will have respect unto Your statutes
   continually."

   Both verses show you the importance of the prayer and both together,
   will, I hope, enlist your earnest attention to what I may have to say
   upon it. It is a very sweet remark that every prayer is an inverted
   promise. That is to say, God promises us such a blessing and,
   therefore, we pray for it. Or, if you please, if God teaches us to pray
   for any good thing, we may gather, by implication, the assurance that
   He means to give it! If you feel in your heart a God-inspired desire to
   ask a certain favor, it is because God intends to bestow it upon you! A
   prayer is the shadow of a coming blessing. Therefore we pray because
   the blessing is coming!

   It is said that prayer cannot alter the purpose of God. Of course it
   cannot! It does not alter it, but indicates it, and since people are
   moved to pray this way or that way by the Spirit of God, it is because
   the Spirit knows the mind of God and His movement to pray is a
   Revelation of the mind of God to the praying one! Believing
   supplication is God writing His desires upon the hearts of His own
   children with the intent to fulfill them. Is it not written, Delight
   yourself, also, in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your
   heart? It is not that God will give the desires of His heart to every
   man. No--but to that man whose heart is in such sympathy with God that
   he delights in God and, consequently, desires what God desires! Then,
   when our heart runs side by side with the mind of God, our prayer is
   parallel with His purpose and, consequently, it is done unto us
   according to our desire.

   Now, I conceive that it is always according to God's mind to hold His
   servants up. He delights not in their slips or falls--to suppose such a
   thing were blasphemous! "The steps of a good man are ordered of the
   Lord." God is pleased with the steadfastness of His chosen. He smiles
   upon the firmness of their standing. God would not have one of His
   people even dash his foot against a stone and, therefore, He sets the
   angels to guard them. If they do trip in their walk, He is quick to
   restore them, for He cannot endure that they should lie in the mire.
   His joy is that we walk with Him in constant holiness and He is ready
   to grant us this gift.

   This prayer shows in David a great sense of the need of being upheld--a
   strong conviction that God could uphold Him--and an expectation and
   hope that He would surely do so in answer to his prayer. May we
   appropriate this prayer with somewhat of David's feeling--deeply
   conscious of utter helplessness, fully believing that the Omnipotent
   Grace of God can meet that helplessness--and confident that He will
   hear our cry and answer us and uphold us to the end. Let us

   believe that our heavenly Father will keep us from falling, but let us
   be well assured that apart from His keeping, our soul will fall--and
   great will be the fall!

   First, I shall speak of God's holding us up and then of the two
   blessings that come out of it, namely, safety and watchfulness. "I
   shall be safe," and, "I shall have respect unto Your statutes
   continually."

   I. First, then, UPHOLDING--God's holding us up. It implies a danger and
   that danger takes many forms. The true description of a believing man's
   life is that he walks in his uprightness. The figure is not hard to
   understand. "God made man upright, though he has sought out many
   inventions." The very form and figure of man's body teach us that we
   are not made to go on "all fours," gazing at the earth from where we
   sprang, but erect upon our feet, looking upward to the Heaven towards
   which we tend by God's rich Grace.

   You know what is meant by an upright man, a man who does not lean this
   way or that, and who is not biased or inclined to that which is wrong.
   The upright column is the only one which can stand alone and he who is
   upright is independent, taking his stand, maintaining his place without
   a buttress to keep him in it. A very pillar of the earth is such a man.
   He may say, like David, "The earth is dissolved: I bear up the pillars
   thereof." So have I seen amid vast masses of surrounding ruin a goodly
   pillar lift its capital aloft as if it laughed at destruction. There is
   something bright and cheering about the thought of the Believer being
   an upright man--but the danger is that he may not continue upright.

   Columns, slowly undermined, lean to this side or that, and their fall
   is near. Unseen earthworms sink the hidden bases of pillars and cast
   them down. And secret vices have thus brought down many a noble
   character. A Christian man is a pilgrim and he makes progress in his
   march to Glory so long as he walks uprightly. But will he keep his
   uprightness? No! He is certain not to keep upright unless he is upheld,
   for the way is slippery. Ah, how slippery do some find it! It is as a
   hill of ice and at some points it is more treacherous than usual. Those
   who have ever gone over the Grimsel Pass will remember that on one side
   of it, in descending, there is a place they call, "Hell Place," because
   the road is narrow and shelving--and the precipice on that side is
   exceedingly deep--while the path is singularly smooth.

   Rain water drips and sometimes flows considerably over the red rock and
   keeps it polished as the floor of a royal sa-lon--and though they chip
   out grips across the road that there may be a foothold, yet most
   travelers find it best to leave their mules and tread with timid
   footsteps over the slippery way. I have a lively recollection of that
   marble floor! I think they called it porphyry, but it had no charms for
   me. Most of us have had a, "Hell Place" in our journey to Heaven. You
   remember Joseph's slippery way and how God upheld him, otherwise he had
   fallen, never to rise. David had the same and his fall was grievous. I
   say that there is scarcely a man who has not had some glassy bit of
   road where, at the best, his feet had almost gone; his steps had
   well-nigh slipped and he had been down on his face if almighty Grace
   had not interposed.

   Nor is the best part of the road without its dangers. Believe me, no
   foot of the way is safe to the careless. I have noticed that more men
   sin without temptation than with it and that the heaviest falls occur
   upon perfectly level road where there does not seem to be a stone to
   catch the foot. Oh, take heed! Take heed! For there is not one point in
   the journey-- from the setting out at the wicket gate even till you
   reach the river's brink--which has not dangers in it! The prayer is
   always in season, "Hold You me up!" But that is not all. It is our feet
   that made the danger, as well as the way. A strong, well-footed man can
   traverse the precipitous mountain side and never think of a slip. Have
   you not seen the mountaineer go tripping up the rocks, with a heavy
   load upon him, as firmly-footed as if he had been climbing the steps of
   the Royal Exchange?

   Have you not seen him come leaping down, again, with his alpenstock,
   where you could not have trod for a minute? It seemed as if scarcely a
   rabbit or a chamois could have found a pathway, and yet the strong,
   sure-footed man has almost danced down beneath his burden. How often
   have I envied the Alpine peasant those legs and feet! It is much the
   same in spiritual things. Strong men stand on their high places and
   leap from crag to crag--but as for us, we are not strong or
   sure-footed. Alas! We have feeble knees and hands that hang down! And
   often we are as weak as water. We are children whose tottering
   footsteps are not as yet familiar with running or climbing. It is as
   much as we can do to stand when leaning on the Beloved--but to stand
   upright upon a rough road has not yet come to such feebleness as ours!

   I speak not of you all, but of far too many. The most of us are poor
   puny things. Ah, if you know yourself, you will not think that you can
   stand. It will rather be a wonder to you that you have not already
   fallen! And when you see others slip, your heart will be in your mouth,
   for you will say, "I am next--I next, unless the Grace of God
   prevents." So, what with the way and our feet, we have need to pray,
   "Hold You me up!" But that is not all, for there are cunning foes that
   seek to trip us up. They lay snares for us--they dig pits and cast
   their nets across the way. Perhaps some of you are hap-

   pily free from tempters in your own households and possibly some are
   free from distinct temptation from the world. I congratulate you! But
   very few of us are in that condition.

   Our foes compass us about like bees. Some threaten; others flatter. A
   few would bribe us; more would bully us. The bad would deceive, for
   they put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. And the best of men, if
   you follow them too closely, may mislead you. Trust not in any
   brother--neither lay hands upon any human guide. There is One that can
   conduct you safely, but if you do not follow Him, you will soon slip
   with your feet. Many watch for our slipping and if they could find us
   tripping they would report it with glee to all the sons of Belial!
   Therefore have we good need to say, "Hold You me up." Specially is
   there such need to those of you who work in shops where ungodliness is
   in the ascendant so that religion is held in ridicule. Great need is
   there in the cases of children of ungodly parents with a father who
   will, if he can find you doing a little amiss, make a great deal of it.
   Equal necessity is there to you young men who meet with conceited ones
   who talk philosophy and rail at our old-fashioned faith. You should
   pray, "Lord, hold You me up, and I shall be safe."

   Nor is this all, though it is quite enough, for sometimes, dear
   Friends, the difficulty of keeping our balance is not caused by the
   way, itself, but by the height to which God may elevate us. There are
   Brothers whose position is high whose brain might, long ago, have
   reeled had not infinite Mercy held them up. I know those who have not a
   tenth of their popularity or a hundredth part of their influence who,
   nevertheless, give themselves mighty airs. These lofty-minded gentlemen
   are in the greatest danger! Let me speak of these grandees--with all
   due reverence let me take them at their own value for once--though I
   should be sorry to be forced to complete the purchase.

   My dear Friend, when you are getting on in the world and prospering,
   something whispers, "You are a clever fellow." And when you have won
   respect by your talent, then, again, a voice sweetly sings, "You are a
   highly superior person." At such times you are in serious peril! It
   happens to most of us, at times, to have done so well as to have won
   the approbation of our little circle. And then the temptation is quite
   great enough--though it comes not from thousands, or even from
   hundreds, but from half-dozens--for us to feel that we are somebody,
   too. Then the brain grows dizzy and the danger is great! Anything which
   leads to self-esteem leads to the utmost jeopardy. If you have a lowly
   opinion of yourself, I congratulate you--for this is a main element of
   safety.

   The prayer is all the more necessary for one other reason, namely, that
   the most of people do not keep upright. Go forth into the world
   tomorrow and see how men are acting! Borrow the lantern of Diogenes and
   try, if you can, to find an honest man! You will succeed, but when you
   have done so, take security for his keeping so. On the exchange, in the
   market, almost everywhere--the bulk of men are not upright--they are
   down on all fours. There is a great gold scramble and they are
   clutching at it with all their might! Get money! Get money! Is not that
   the world's own favorite teaching--get it honestly if you can--but, if
   you cannot, get it in that way, get it how you can! Puff! Lie! Cheat!
   Do anything, only make a fortune! He is the most clever fellow who can
   grab the most gold!

   That is the picture of the business world--a nursery floor of grown-up
   children scrambling on all fours. But you say they do not lie. No,
   no--only white lies. No, they do not cheat--it is only, "the custom of
   the trade," you know. "Now, do not talk," they say to me, "what do you
   know about it?" More than you think, perhaps, for lookers-on see more
   than players. "But, Sir, business is business." I know it is, and
   business has no business to be such business as it often is! Woe to the
   man whose business will destroy his soul! Woe, double woe, to the man
   whose business destroys the bodies and souls of drunks! Woe three times
   over to the wretch who fattens on the iniquities of his fellow men and
   gets rich by their damnation--and yet pretends to religion!

   But I am wandering--it is because so many people lean this way, or that
   way, or go altogether on all fours, that it is not the easiest thing in
   this world for a man to stand upright. He ought to say, "If the world's
   fate hung on a lie and I, by speaking the lie, could save it, I would
   speak the truth." If our life depended upon doing what God would not
   approve, we ought rather to die than sin! Such should be the resolve of
   the Believer and he should ask for Grace to carry it out. Lord, hold
   You me up: keep me upright. Whatever happens, do not let me be any
   other than an upright, downright, perpendicular man, knowing the right
   thing, speaking the right thing, doing the right thing, by Your Grace,
   even to the end.

   But you see the danger--the text suggests it to me. To my ear there is
   a sharp sound in it. It is almost a cry of sudden alarm. It is as if
   one felt himself falling and cried aloud, "Hold me up!" The deep
   descent yawns before him; the earth glides from under him; he cannot
   regain his footing and piteously he implores, "Hold You me up." It has
   come to this-- there is an end of the man unless a Power beyond his own
   shall uphold him. O Lord, see You to it! Now, how does God

   keep His people upright? He has many ways of doing it and, therefore,
   you may pray very hopefully. He can preserve you by angels--"They shall
   bear you up in their hands, lest at any time you dash your foot against
   a stone."

   How many stones you and I might have dashed our feet against if it had
   not been that we have received mysterious intimations which have put us
   on our guard. Often and often have I been inwardly admonished and so
   preserved from evil. We never knew where it came from, but perhaps the
   Lord sent the singular intimation by an angel whose noiseless wings
   came and went, and we knew not of the messenger, though we felt the
   message. God works mightily this way with many who are obedient to His
   will. At other times God holds up His people by the ministry of the
   Word of God. I have often been told that when you have come in here, I,
   not knowing anything of your case, have, nevertheless, spoken to it
   exactly--and you have had the admonition, or the encouragement and
   direction which you needed at this point and that.

   To many of you my voice has been as the Oracle of God and that in the
   verse of a hymn, or in the chapter chosen, or in a pointed remark in
   the sermon. Is it not so? Could not many of you bear testimony to it?
   God's Word, wherever it is faithfully spoken, is a wall of fire round
   about God's people. It protects them from lurking foes of whose
   existence they were not aware. A gracious promise supplies them with
   just that stimulus which they need in the hour of fainting or a stern
   rebuke acts as the restraint which they require in the moment of
   temptation.

   And have you not found it so, too, by the reading of the Word in your
   own homes? The promise or the precept has come in exactly to fit your
   case and you have heard from the Scriptures a voice that said, "This is
   the way: walk you in it." And you have also been gently made willing to
   walk in it and so you have been kept in your integrity. Were professors
   more familiar with their Bibles, they would be less in danger from the
   common evils of the times. Oh that the Holy Spirit may give us all a
   deeper love for the Word of God so that we may be upheld that no
   iniquity may have dominion over us!

   Often God keeps His people upright, and holds them firmly, by
   chastisement. When roughly smitten you feel as though you were a child
   falling over a precipice, half dazed by terror. And then your father
   has taken hold of you and, by severely shaking you, has awakened you
   and saved you. I have seen a driver give a horse a flip because he was
   getting sleepy and had stumbled--that cut woke up the creature and he
   went with a sure foot afterwards. The Lord has often saved us from a
   sad fall by a sharp chastisement. "Before I was afflicted I went
   astray, but now have I kept Your Word." At times, the chastisement has
   been rather of the spirit than of anything outward. All things have
   gone well externally, but you have been depressed and despondent--and
   that drooping has been ordained by God that you might endure your
   prosperity and truly prosper in it. Lest your high places of success
   should cause you to slip, you have been kept low in spirit that you
   might be kept up in holy living to God's Glory! You have been laid down
   that you might not fall down!

   God sometimes humbles His people that they may not need to be humbled,
   for to be humbled is terrible, but to be made humble by His Grace is
   exceedingly sweet. It is clear that our gracious Lord can hold us up by
   many methods. We are very far from having hinted at a tenth of them. I
   have known Him preserve His people by giving them great aspirations,
   high ideals, noble desires. With his eyes on the stars, the sailor boy
   is steady at the masthead. I have known Him hold up His servants by
   giving them plenty to do--by putting them into the Sunday school and
   interesting them with the children or drafting them into the Loan Tract
   Society and keeping them there. It is a grand way of keeping us
   right--never to let us have an idle 10 minutes, nor a spare napkin to
   wrap a talent in.

   The supreme Power which upholds us is the Holy Spirit, who, dwelling in
   us, warns us against evil; sets us on our watchtower against
   temptation; incites us to all manner of good things and so helps us to
   stand in the evil day. How much we owe to the love of the Spirit! He
   keeps the feet of the saints. When they are tried, He quickens them,
   and by gaining more life they surmount temptation! When they are likely
   to be deceived, He enlightens them, and so the Evil One touches them
   not. By sanctification, by helping our infirmities, by teaching us the
   Divine will and by His Divine comfort, He holds us up--and to Him be
   Glory forevermore!

   Thus have I shown you the danger and how it can be prevented. Oh, how
   sweetly can the Lord prevent it, and how He has prevented it in many of
   His dear people! In order to prove this, I could point you to
   biographies of godly men. Perhaps that might be better than giving you
   even a hint about those who are yet alive, though there are many such,
   and such among ourselves. As to the departed ones upon whom my mind is
   now resting, their Lord did not allow them to slip at any time, but
   their garments were always white. They had many dangers and perils, but
   they walked uprightly all their

   days. So far from their having slipped, there seemed to be nothing in
   them but what we could hold up for admiration, giving to God's Grace
   all the praise!

   Blessed are those men of faith who are never allowed to fall, in whom
   you see no groveling, whose noble lives are free from selfishness and
   far above the aims of carnal men! In them was no bending, no stooping
   from uprightness, but a rising, a growing elevation, till even here,
   among the sons of men, they had a dignity and presence as of another
   world. Thus have I set before you the upholding.

   II. Briefly, I desire to show the TWO BLESSED THINGS THAT COME OUT OF
   THIS HOLDING UP. If God uphold us, then, according to the text, we
   shall be safe. "Hold You me up, and I shall be safe." It is a great
   point to be safe, though there are some who prefer to be sharp. Some
   men are always trying little dodges by which they would take advantage
   of their neighbors. "A sharp fellow, that," cries one. "A desperately
   clever man," says another. "Hardly know where to find him," hints a
   third. "Rather sharper than honest," mutters a fourth. Just so.

   Now, if God holds you up, I do not say that you will be clever, but you
   will be what is a deal better--you will be safe. "Hold You me up, and I
   shall be safe." That is, you will be safe from all real harm. Suppose
   that you should meet with great troubles in business? You will still be
   safe if God upholds you so that you do not lose your integrity. So long
   as we do not lose a good conscience, we have not lost much if we have
   lost all. He that damages his character has sustained the worst damage
   a mortal man can know! But he that is held up--kept upright--has been
   kept safely! It may be that he shall be slandered, but if he knows that
   before God he has walked uprightly, he shall be "safe." God will light
   his candle in due time and his light shall shine as the sun at noonday!
   Only if you hold fast your integrity and will not let it go--and God's
   Grace can help you to do that--you shall be safe in calamity, peaceful
   in panic, happy in poverty, brave under slander--in fact, "safe" in all
   senses of the term!

   Like the lighthouse on the lone rock, buffeted by the storm, you shall
   stand out above all tempests SAFE. You shall be safe, too, from
   descending into grievous sin. The man who is held upright shall not
   insensibly sink lower and lower, as some do. Alas, I have seen the
   godly man put forth his hand unto iniquity. At first he seemed excused.
   No one could blame him. It was an hour of dire necessity and that he
   was overcome and did a questionable thing was not much to be marveled
   at, though it was enough to make an angel weep that such a man as he
   should stoop to it. After once doing the questionable thing, he had
   spoiled the chastity of his conscience, and he was open to a grosser
   sin--and he fell into that grosser sin--yet, still, it was not such a
   fault as the world would much condemn. A little farther and but a
   little farther, and he committed a crime that made the godly cast him
   off and the wicked exult over him. "Howl, fir tree, for the cedar is

   fallen!"

   For you and for me there is no safety in any degree of bending. We must
   stand upright or we cannot stand at all! "Hold You me up"--up, up--"and
   I shall be safe." But if I begin to incline downward in any way I am
   not safe. He that leans will fall! But the upright will stand, for God
   is able to make him stand even unto the end. I believe that when David
   said that by being held up he should be safe, he meant, also, that he
   should know that he was safe and should enjoy great restfulness of
   heart. Dear Brothers and Sisters, I know that you are very much tried
   in this world and often tempted to do that which is not right. But, if
   God keeps you from evil, how happy you are, because you are "safe"! You
   have a light pocket, but a light heart, too! Some have a heavy purse
   and a heavy heart to go with it. It is better for you to be in poverty
   and to be holy, than it would be to be unholy and to roll in wealth.

   May God give you things convenient for you--so would I pray--but I
   would not ask Him to give you even a necessary meal as the result of an
   evil deed, much less to succeed you in a dishonest transaction, for
   nothing can be worse than to do wrong and prosper in it! If you are a
   child of God, there is no prosperity for you except by doing that which
   is right. Others may hoard the wages of unrighteousness. They would
   melt like hoarfrost in your hands. May you be prospered in all your
   works and may your substance increase. If God ordains it, so will it
   be. And if it is not so, what a mercy it is to carry in your heart that
   little bird which sings, "All is well! All is well!" He that can pick a
   bit of heartsease from within his bosom and wear it in his buttonhole,
   need not envy my lord his stars and garters--for that herb called
   heartsease is more precious than all else that grows beneath the
   moon--and God makes it bloom in the garden of the man who walks
   uprightly!

   The man that walks uprightly and is kept in God's way, is "safe," and I
   venture to give another meaning to that word, "safe"--namely, that he
   becomes a safe man in his dealings with others. If you catch a man
   playing the double shuffle at any time, let him play it for himself,
   but not for you! Never link yourself in business with a person who is
   capa-

   ble of doing an unrighteous action. Sink or swim for yourself, but
   never set foot on board such a coffin ship! Sooner or later it will go
   to the bottom. May God make you to be upright, that you may be a safe
   man, true and trustworthy, for men delight to trust in men when once
   they find them "safe."

   If you would possess the best of human friends, you will be happy
   should you meet with the man who in youth was an ardent Christian and
   has continued so throughout a generation. In times of stress and trial
   when others fell, he stood upright and incorruptible. Under slander he
   has smarted, but he has outlived the reproach and disproved every false
   report. Today his name is the guarantee of truth, the watchword of
   honor! Where he leads, others feel it safe to follow! They wait till he
   speaks; his judgment rules the board. Because the Lord kept him
   upright, he grew to be safe in the esteem of his neighbors and now he
   is as a hiding place from the wind and a cover from the storm. A truly
   good man is a haven in trouble, a harbor for those who are tossed with
   tempest--the sons of Adam in distress fly to him, in his degree, as
   they do to his Master. If he swears to his own hurt, he changes not,
   but stands to the truth at all hazards. Men admire this and they trust
   him, if not with untold gold, yet with secrets which, to all other
   hearts, remain untold. May God make you such a man! The way to such
   honor lies by that prayer, "Hold You me up, and I shall be safe."

   But, lastly, when a man knows that he is "safe," by God's Grace, does
   he then become idle and careless, and think he may do as he likes? No,
   listen--"I shall be safe, and I will have respect unto Your statutes
   continually." Watchfulness attends such sacred safety and is, at once,
   its fruit and its sign! A holy man--a man made holy by God's Grace--has
   great respect to every command of God! Before he moves, he looks round
   him to see whether he shall transgress by his proposed movement. You
   have heard of the child whose mother said, "John, you have broken one
   of the Commandments," and he answered, "Mother, those Commandments are
   awfully easy to break." With such natures as ours, sin is a very easy
   thing. You break the Law before you know it--and unless a man has
   respect unto all the Commandments, he will soon be trespassing and
   getting into mischief.

   We ought, in our daily life, to walk as one that has to tread among
   eggs or delicate china. Heedless and Too-Bold soon rush into sin, but
   the genuine Believer always fears. "You are very jealous of how you
   act," said one to a saint of God. "Yes," he replied, "I serve a jealous
   God." "You are too precise," said another. "That is a crime," he said,
   "that God will never charge any of His children with." A conscience
   tender as the apple of an eye is what we want. To be alarmed, even at
   the distant approach of sin, is the safeguard of a child of God! Those
   who dally with vice will rue such dalliance when it cannot be undone!
   If somebody told me that there was a cobra at the far end of my room, I
   should look round for the door--I think such venomous creatures are
   near enough if they remain in their native jungles--I do not desire
   their interesting society.

   So should it be with sin. We should flee from it at once, avoiding its
   first appearance, hating it in thought and word before it hatches into
   act, abhorring even the garment spotted by the flesh! This holy
   jealousy to do the Lord's will must last continually. "I will have
   respect unto Your statutes continually." I will always try to obey. I
   will always endeavor to avoid any transgression of the Light of God.
   Now, dear Friends, you see this safety comes, and this special
   tenderness towards God's Law comes of God's holding us up, for He holds
   us up so that we never go down. Under His incessant upholding we shall
   be "safe"--and we shall be conscientious--but not otherwise. A few
   minutes' folly may ruin years of character. The man that is not held up
   goes down and rolls in the mire. He is never a conscientious man or a
   "safe" man, perhaps, for the rest of his life.

   I know some that I hope are God's people, but they have not been upheld
   so as to be always complete in their integrity and, consequently, they
   are not "safe." They are people that we have to watch over with great
   care, for we are afraid of them. We could not trust them to lead, for
   their example is a lame one. Moreover, they are not keenly, sensitively
   conscientious. They can go to much greater lengths than the Lord Jesus
   would approve and yet they are members of the Church--pretty talkative
   members, too. May God improve them and mend them! They need it and God,
   alone, can do it, for they do not take their minister's plain hints.
   These people have no clear and sharp discrimination of what is right
   and wrong according to God's way, but they go as far as they can
   towards the world--to enjoy the pleasures of the un-godly--and yet they
   would keep in with Christians.

   They are Jacks-of-Both-Sides. They run with the hare and yet hold with
   the hounds, and they will be glad to have a mouth full when the hounds
   catch the hare. This is poor work! This produces a sorry sort of
   Christian! Under such double influences we shall be unsafe and rather a
   curse to others than a blessing to them. If our integrity is always
   maintained by God, we shall become safe men--the pillars of the
   Church--we shall have a tender conscience that will warn us of the

   approach of evil and we shall be such as God can honor and make useful
   to the Brethren. So I close by commending to you, my dearly Beloved in
   Christ, the prayer of the text, "Hold You me up." Every morning before
   you see the face of men, register this prayer in Heaven--"Hold You me
   up, and I shall be safe, and I shall have respect unto Your statutes
   continually."

   Are you going downstairs without that prayer? Then you may fall into
   sin at the breakfast table! You may lose your temper and a trifle not
   worth noticing may put you off the tram lines for the day. Therefore
   pray before the car moves. You have taken your hat and your gloves and
   you are going off to the City. Does it happen that there you meet
   careless, godless men? Are you tempted there? Then as you get into your
   train, or as you trudge along the pavement, breathe the prayer, "Hold
   You me up, and I shall be safe." You can meet the worst of men without
   fear. You have your shield on your arm, and the two-edged sword of God
   at your side! You are prepared for all hazards now that the upholding
   prayer has been breathed before the Most High!

   Did you say that you are not going to the City today? It is a day's
   excursion, is it? You are going into the country to see friends, or you
   are to make holiday with a few companions? All well and good. You may
   have such recreations very properly--but now is a special time for the
   prayer--"Hold You me up." Your friends will not be all saints,
   probably, and when they go a little way in mirth, perhaps they will run
   a little too far. Therefore, entreat the Keeper of Israel, now, "Hold
   then me up, and I shall be safe"--safe at my play as well as at my
   work. The child of God in his recreation should prove that he has
   undergone a re-creation which has made him a new creature in Christ
   Jesus. Grace should enter into all our enjoyments as well as into all
   our employments.

   No, but that does not happen to be your lot. You are not indulged with
   a day's pleasure--you are going to perform a service surrounded with
   difficulty. It tries your brain and frets your heart. It is more than
   you feel at all able to carry through and yet you must do it. Now is
   your peculiar time of need! Now is the hour to pray, "Hold You me up."
   I have known young Brothers who, when first they have gone to a bank,
   have been so anxious to have their balances right and when they have
   gone round collecting have been so careful to be correct that they have
   made great errors--not through any dishonesty, but simply through their
   blundering because they were so excited! In their consuming anxiety to
   be exact, they have confused themselves into errors! Let the gracious
   young man do right and leave himself with God. Do not be nervous, but
   be prayerful.

   Ask the Lord to help you. Ask Him to help you about everything--about
   casting up a column of figures. My Lord Jesus counts the very hairs of
   His children's heads and He will help them in their little things as
   well as in their great things! You may ask that you may have favor in
   the sight of those that employ you and God will give it to you if it is
   good for you. Only cry, "Lord, help me to do right! And if I make a
   mistake let it be a mistake--but You hold me up and upright to the
   end." Perhaps, dear Friends, you have to travel this week over a very
   unwelcome road, for you have been over it before and wished that you
   had never seen it. And yet you have that journey in prospect and there
   is no avoiding it! You have to visit those dangerous friends who led
   you into sore temptation two years ago. You have to undergo, the second
   time, an experience which before led you into sin. Then, pray eagerly,
   "Hold You me up." Ask for double Grace! You know the danger of the road
   and your own feebleness, but you will get over it well enough by God's
   upholding Grace.

   But it may be, dear Friends, that you are prospering. God is giving you
   success and the desire of your heart has come to you. Be sure to pray
   earnestly, "Hold You me up, and I shall be safe" for it is a dangerous
   thing for a child of God to prosper in this world! And yet it is a
   danger which many unwisely covet. If you are growing rich and great,
   pray God to hold you up. Or it may be that you are now going down into
   adversity. Things have gone wrong with you, as you think. You have to
   give up that fine house and lovely garden. You are moving into small
   rooms. You still have expenses, but your income has shrunk terribly.
   You hardly know how you shall support your wife and children. Now pray,
   "Hold You me up." Use the prayer of Agur--"Give me neither poverty nor
   riches." He that kept you when you were rich will not shun you, now
   that you are poor! Ask Him to uphold you still. He is able to do it and
   as willing as He is able.

   Ah, some of you are getting old--I respectfully commend to you this
   prayer as suitable for the close of life. Young people, you must pray,
   for your passions are strong and your wisdom is little. O young men and
   maidens, pray, each one of you, "Hold You me up." But, oh, dear aged
   Brothers and Sisters, excuse me who am so much younger, when I solemnly
   add--to you is this word of warning sent! Cease not to plead for
   upholding Grace! Horses sometimes fall at the

   bottom of the hill--the drivers grew careless and thought there was no
   further need for caution--and down went the horse.

   The worst falls I have ever seen in the Church of God have happened to
   elderly men, men of experience and years. All through Scripture we meet
   with cases of the aged falling into sin. Mind that. They boast their
   experience and wisdom-- and then the devil laughs in his sleeve and
   makes fools of them! If we were as old as Methuselah and as holy as
   Enoch, we ought still to cry, "Hold You me up!" And when we get to
   Jordan's brink and the chill stream begins to rise to our ankles, what
   a blessing it is that the Lord will hold us up! "Courage, Brother!"
   said Hopeful to Christian, when he was up to his neck in the
   stream--"Courage, my Brother! I feel the bottom and it is good." And so
   they joyfully crossed over and climbed the hill whereon the Celestial
   City was built!

   And there, I think, among the songs that we shall sing unto our
   Well-Beloved, this will be a peculiarly sweet one--

   "When I said,

   My foot slips!

   Your mercy, O Lord,

   Held me up."

   "Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of His Glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Savior, be Glory and majesty, dominion and power,
   both now and forever. Amen."

Healed or Deluded? Which?

   (No. 1658)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 7, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly,
   saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace." Jeremiah 8:11.

   "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved:
   for You are my praise." Jeremiah 17:14.

   THE people among whom Jeremiah dwelt had received a grievous hurt and
   they felt it, for they were invaded by cruel enemies. Their goods were
   plundered, their children were slain and their cities burned. Jeremiah,
   with true love to his nation, warned them that the cause of all their
   trouble was that they had forsaken their God. They had turned aside
   from the living God and had made gods of the idols of the nations round
   about them, and so had provoked Jehovah to jealousy. Therefore He
   chastened them sorely and plagued them again and again, even as He had
   threatened them from of old. He took up the quarrel of His Covenant and
   He made them smart, indeed.

   Jeremiah tried to show them that the only way to be healed of their
   hurt was to be healed of their sin--that if they would give up their
   idolatry and all the infamous wickedness that grew out of it--and turn
   to the true God and obey His Commandments, then brighter days would
   come. Their conscience must have told them that all this was true but,
   alas, Jeremiah preached to them in vain! As the old classic prophetess
   Cassandra was doomed forever to speak the truth and never to be
   believed, so was Jeremiah--the people heard him, but they regarded him
   not. Meanwhile, certain pretenders to prophecy opposed Jeremiah and
   sought to win the confidence of the nation. They came with, "Thus says
   the Lord," upon their lips, blasphemously pretending to be speaking in
   the name of Jehovah when Jehovah had not sent them. Nor did they seek
   His Glory.

   These suggested to the people easier remedies than repentance--they
   should make an alliance with Egypt and in that way beat off the
   Assyrians. They should send a certain amount of tribute to the great
   king and thus buy off his armies. They buoyed up the people's hopes
   with vain confidences and took them away from repenting and returning
   to God. No good came of their teachings--they did but film the wound of
   the nation and left the deadly venom still within. The hopes which they
   excited lasted but for a little time and then died out in blank
   despair. They had not touched the root which bore the wormwood. They
   had made light of the national sin. They had healed the hurt of Judah
   slightly, saying, "Peace, peace," when there was no peace.

   God's servants, today, who are the true successors of the Prophets,
   have a task before them sterner, even, than that of the ancient Seers!
   It is not ours to point to smoking ruins and the carcasses of the
   unburied dead--plain evidences of a grievous hurt--but our work is to
   deal with spiritual sickness and to come among a people who confess no
   hurt. Great multitudes of our hearers do not welcome the news of a
   heavenly remedy because they are not aware that they are sick! They are
   not only sound in wind and limb, but in head and heart. From the crown
   of their head to the sole of their feet they have scarcely a blemish on
   them! Or if they have some little spot here and there, yet they are
   much superior to the general run of mankind and need no special
   spiritual surgery.

   A physician who has to commence his practice by convincing his
   neighbors that they are sick has not a very hopeful sphere before him.
   Such is our work--we have, first of all, to declare in the name of the
   God, the Truth that man is fallen; that his heart is deceitful above
   all things and desperately wicked; that he is a sinner doomed to
   die--and such a sinner that there is no reclaiming him unless the
   Ethiopian can change his skin and the leopard his spots! Truths so hu-

   miliating to human pride are by no means popular! Men prefer to hear
   the smooth periods of those who parade the dignity of human nature. The
   very phrase grates on my ears--talk of the dignity of a dunghill and
   you are as near the mark!

   Man, viewed as fallen, descends below the level of the beast which
   perishes, for the beast has not offended its Creator. Look how Adam's
   proud descendants rage against this Truth of God! To persuade them of
   it is a work so hard as to be utterly hopeless unless the Spirit of
   God, Himself, shall undertake it! It is a divinely wise arrangement
   that He has undertaken it--as it is written, "When He, the Spirit of
   Truth, is come, He shall convince the world of sin." When that great
   labor is accomplished, we have yet another, remaining, namely, to
   excite in men a desire to seek healing! Many there are who confess
   their disease, but the disease of sin has worked in them a spiritual
   lethargy so that they find a horrible rest in their lost estate! They
   have no longing to rise to spiritual health, of which, indeed, they
   know nothing. They are guilty and willing to remain guilty--inclined to
   evil and content with the inclination!

   Hundreds live and die in this condition. They know that there is a
   wrath to come on account of sin, but they put far from them the evil
   day and amuse themselves with the mirth of the present. They do not
   deny that a great change must be undergone by them before they can
   enter Heaven, but then there is time enough for this, for even at the
   11th hour they may be called by Divine Grace! They are willing to run
   the risk of gasping out a last penitential prayer--and so they give
   Mercy a denial, refusing the Good Physician because they are afraid of
   being well too soon. Ah, me! We must bring them out of this. They will
   perish unless they are quickened out of this indifference--they will
   sleep themselves into Hell unless we can find an antidote to the
   opiates of sin. Like the rich man, of whom we read that in Hell he
   lifted up his eyes, being in torments, they will dream on till their
   awakening will be too late. Would to God they might lift up their eyes
   while there is yet a hope of their beholding Christ upon the Cross and
   finding everlasting life in Him!

   After these things are done, we have but stormed the outworks of the
   castle, for there still remains another difficulty. Convinced that they
   need healing and made, in a measure, anxious to find it, the danger
   with the awakened is lest they should rest content with an apparent
   cure and miss the real work of Grace! We are perilously likely to rest
   satisfied with a slight healing and, by this means, to miss the great
   and complete salvation which comes from God, alone. I wish to speak in
   deep earnestness to everyone here present upon this subject, for I have
   felt the power of it in my own soul. To deliver this message I have
   made a desperate effort--quitting my sick bed without due permit--and
   moved by a restless pining to warn you against the counterfeits of the
   day.

   I have taken two texts. First, that I may show how easy it is for us to
   be deluded into a slight healing and, secondly, that I may plead with
   you to seek real healing. And, lastly, that I may plainly show where
   the true healing is to be had according to the teaching of our second
   text, "Heal me, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved."

   I. First, then, we sorrowfully assert that IT IS VERY EASY FOR US TO BE
   THE SUBJECTS OF A FALSE HEALING. You will kindly understand that I am
   not going to talk about the inhabitants of the Island of Laputa--I am
   now speaking straight to every one of you and I am setting myself in
   the middle pew that my keenest sentence may enter my own heart as well
   as yours! I say, we are, all of us, in danger of being the subjects of
   a false healing--ministers, deacons, elders, Church members, aged
   professors and young beginners--all alike! We might infer this from the
   fact that, no doubt, a large number of persons are deceived.

   If a large number of persons are so, then why should not we be? The
   tendency of other men is probably also in us. Why not? Are there not
   many persons who consider that all is well with themselves because they
   have been observant of Church ordinances from their youth up? And their
   parents were observant for them before they actually came upon the
   stage of responsibility? Were they not duly christened and correctly
   confirmed? Have they not taken the sacrament? Have they not gone
   through every form that is required by the sect to which they belong?
   What more can be needed? They do not, in so many words, assert that
   these ceremonies have given them perfect wholeness before God, but
   secretly they pour this flattering unction upon their souls and lie
   down in quietness! If they are not all right, where will you find any
   who are?

   On the other hand, it may be that some now present are thankful that
   they never were christened nor confirmed and they think a good deal of
   not having undergone those ceremonies. Let them not err in the same way
   as those they are judging! They have been attentive to religion from
   their own point of view--they are never absent from their pew; they
   like to be at Prayer Meetings--they enjoy everything that has the stamp
   of Christianity upon it and, therefore, they enquire no further, but
   take their safety for granted! They are afraid of digging too deep and
   so they are satisfied with hav-

   ing a form of godliness. Though they have felt no change of heart and
   no renewal of spirit, they, nevertheless, believe that all is well with
   them--at least they hope so--and, therefore, they are at ease in Zion.

   This is a poor, slovenly soul-surgery which will end in eternal death!
   Beware of it, I pray you, while yet a work of Grace may be worked upon
   you! Too many are reliant entirely upon external religion. If that is
   attended to, carefully, they conclude that all is right. To sing a hymn
   is, in their minds, a good thing, though their heart never praises God!
   To join in the posture of prayer is, to them, an excellent thing,
   though their heart never cries to God for mercy! Alas, that men should
   dream that the hollow hypocrisy which insults God with empty forms
   should have a magical virtue in it! Oh, that men should be so mad as to
   conceive that the bringing of the mere husks and bran of external
   devotion to God can be anything to Him but sheer mockery, provoking Him
   to greater wrath!

   And yet they mock God with pretended prayers and feel pleased with
   their crime. They chant a heartless hymn and so vex His Spirit--and
   they are pacified by their empty song! The very deeds that will be
   mentioned against them, to condemnation, they quote to their darkened
   mind as hopeful grounds of justification! Outward religion is a slight
   and pretended healing, being, in fact, no healing at all, but a cry of,
   "Peace, peace," when there is no peace! I am afraid, too, that many who
   do not rely upon religious forms yet confide in doctrinal beliefs. They
   are sound in the faith--Orthodox, Evangelical and Calvinistic! They
   heartily detest any doctrine that is not Scriptural. I am glad to find
   that it is so with them--but let them not rest in this! To cover a
   wound with a royal garment is not to heal it and to conceal a sinful
   disposition beneath a sound creed is not salvation! Believe what you
   may, even though you should know the whole Truth of God, yet if your
   faith never changes your heart nor affects your life, you will in no
   way be superior to the devil who be-lieves--no, you may not be quite so
   good as he, for devils believe and tremble--and to believe without
   trembling is a stage lower down!

   Oh, my dear Hearer, I implore you, do not rest content with such a
   slight healing as this! I have heard of one who changed from a
   Churchman to a Dissenter, and another who changed from a Dissenter to a
   Churchman--but I long to hear of you that you have turned from sin to
   righteousness, from self to Jesus! Conversions may be no better than
   perversions unless they are conversions to Christ! We must know the
   Truth of God in the heart or we do not know it at all. Dry doctrine may
   kill--it is only the living Truth of God, worked in us by the Spirit of
   God, that can make us alive! Many are the quackeries of the spiritual
   world. And multiplied are the nostrums of the physicians of no
   value--yielding to men a slight and transient hope.

   If others are deceived, may not we be? Depend upon this, that if there
   is a chance of our being deceived at all, we are always ready to aid in
   the deception! As a rule, we are all inclined to think too well of
   ourselves. I dare say that if any cautious flatterer will assure me
   that I am a very wise person, I shall, before long, come to the
   conclusion that he is a remarkably sensible and far-seeing individual!
   If anyone should accuse you of a virtue which you never possessed, if
   he would but persevere long enough with his pleasing insinuation, you
   will begin to smile inwardly and hint to your conscience that there are
   latent excellencies about you which this man with the prophetic glance
   has discovered! The devil, who knows the exact bait for poor human
   nature, finds it easy to pacify an anxious mind by presenting a false
   salvation and persuading the heart that all is well, while in fact
   nothing is well!

   A little feeling of natural regret flits over the mind and the false
   fiend whispers, "It is repentance." "Oh, yes," says the ready dupe, "I
   am a penitent!" A little presumptuous puffing up of ourselves into
   comfort is indulged and the deceiver sings, "Hail, precious faith!" How
   pleased we are when we jump to the conclusion that we have passed from
   death unto life and are, indeed, the servants of the living God! We do
   not look back to see whether there was any new birth; whether there was
   any change of heart; whether there was any giving up of sin; whether
   there was any laying hold on righteousness; whether there was any
   severance from self and union to Christ! Those enquiries may be
   troublesome and, therefore, the irksome duty of self-examination is
   cried down as unbelief and we are bid to shut our eyes and make up our
   minds that all is right.

   "Believe that you are well and you are well" seems to be the Gospel of
   many, but it is not the Gospel of Jesus! But it is so easy to jump into
   fancied security that many take to it. We are, almost all of us, on the
   side of that which is most easy and comfortable to ourselves--the
   exceptions to this rule are a few morbid spirits who habitually write
   bitter things against themselves--and a few gracious souls whom the
   Holy Spirit has convinced of sin who would comfort themselves if they
   could, but dare not do so. They are dying for need and yet their soul
   abhors all manner of meat. I do not suppose I

   shall do any good this morning except to this last class--and they are
   few. But the words I shall speak will reach their ears, I know, and I
   pray God it may drop into their hearts to comfort them.

   Take this, then, for granted, that there are many ways of being
   slightly healed and we are, most of us, likely to be pleased with one
   or other of them. Besides, flatterers are not yet an extinct race.
   False prophets abounded in Jeremiah's day and they still may be met
   with. I could indicate where they are, but I advise you not to go after
   them. They are to be found in several places of worship in London, but
   you had better leave them alone. There is a flatterer in your own
   bosom, namely, proud Self! Another flatterer often crosses your path
   and is eager to destroy your soul--I mean Satan. If by any possibility
   you can be beguiled to put up with something which looks like healing,
   but which is not, you shall have all the art and craft of Hell to help
   you in it!

   If it is possible, the very elect shall be thus deceived! Instead of
   faith, they shall have presumption; for regeneration, they shall have
   reformation; for holiness, morality; for purity, censoriousness; for
   zeal, fanaticism; for Grace, fancy-- and for Christ and His
   Cross--human works and their merit. Many who profess to love you will
   aid the general deceit and puff you up with the idea of being what you
   are not. Slight healing is sure to be fashionable among a great many
   because it requires so little thought. People will do anything but
   think according to the Word of God. They will both think and speak
   against the revealed will and Truth of God, but to consider what the
   Lord has said is not at all to their mind. They bring forward
   philosophical notions which read like passages of a comedy! He seems to
   be most honored, nowadays, who will invent the most monstrous theory
   and stand to it!

   The more absurd it is the better, so long as it is opposed to the Bible
   and to the accepted beliefs. I do not hesitate to say that any ordinary
   person, who would dethrone his reason and enthrone his imagination,
   could dream up as many good theories in a day as have been invented
   during the last 50 years by our vain-glorious philosophers! Give him
   sufficient liquor to make him half drunk and he might invent many
   more--and those far more philosophical than the folly which rules the
   wisdom of the present hour! The more the philosophies stagger, the more
   they will suit this present age, for that which is really reasonable
   and solid is rejected.

   Sober thought about one's own soul and its destiny is, by no means, a
   favorite occupation with men. How few sit down and answer the question,
   "How much do I owe unto my Lord?" They would sooner hear a thunderclap
   than be asked to consider their ways. They would sooner be flogged than
   sit down and say to their soul-- "How have you dealt towards your
   Creator? What is your state towards your Redeemer? What of love, what
   of fear, what of holy confidence, what of consecration have you ever
   given to Jesus Christ, your Lord? How will it go with you when you come
   to die? How will you fare in the swellings of Jordan? How will you meet
   the Judge of all the earth in the Judgment Day?" Such questions as
   these they put back as only fit for women and for priests! Yet were
   they truly manly, they would be eager to look such enquiries in the
   face. O Sirs, it is a grievous pity that men should be lost for lack of
   thought! I would gladly hold you by the sleeve and beg you to remember
   and consider!

   Superficial religion only requires so much church-going, or attendance
   at a sermon, or so many half-guineas, so much repeating of pious
   phrases and listening to pious periods--it suits the thoughtless--but
   as to seeking after God by meditation, prayer, confession, faith, they
   cannot! Away with it! Superficial religion will always be fashionable
   because it does not require self-denial. A man may be outwardly
   religious and yet be a private tippler, but he cannot be a true
   Christian at that rate. Such secret defilement he must abandon. That,
   however, is a blow too near the root for many-- they like not so sharp
   an axe as that! Or perhaps he has enmity towards his brother. Now he
   can go to "mass" or attend early communion and yet hate his
   brother--but he cannot go to Heaven and do that! He cannot be a
   regenerate man and do that! He may be following, all the while, some
   secret lust and yet be a great man in his church so long as he can keep
   his wantonness hidden away from prying eyes.

   A superficial religion suits the unclean gentleman, but genuine
   godliness will not allow a darling lust to live. Do you wonder that
   vital godliness is at a discount when it proclaims war to the knife
   against a lifelong indulgence? It is with Christ as it might be in
   surgery! Two eminent practitioners profess to deal with the disease
   called polypus. The first declares that he can work an effectual cure,
   but it must be understood that he uses the knife freely. He believes no
   cure to be possible unless all the roots of the growth are taken away.
   He will not pretend to half measures--the whole thing must be
   eliminated, or he can work no cure. On the other side of the street
   another surgeon of great name depends upon an outward application
   which, in quite a painless manner, acts upon the diseased part and,
   according to his statements, se-

   cures the desired result. He says, "My friend goes too deep and makes
   too much of the matter. Come in here! The disease is a mere trifle. I
   will end the mischief without cutting and hacking."

   You can readily guess how popular this last gentleman will be if he can
   gain public confidence! But what will be the end of it? That is the
   point! If the sharp and deep cut of the first surgeon ministers to
   ultimate health and is absolutely necessary to a cure, is it not best?
   If, in the second case, the end of all those honeyed words is but the
   covering up of a foul loathsomeness which will breed corruption and
   hasten death--is it not a wicked deception? Yet most men are so foolish
   as to choose the worse of the two in the affairs of their souls. Slight
   healing, also, is sought by men, because it does not require
   spirituality. There are multitudes of men who, if the Kingdom of Heaven
   were to be had by outward actions--no matter how difficult--would at
   once commence the task! Say, "You must save so many hundreds of pounds
   and buy Heaven," and they would starve themselves until they had
   hoarded up the money! Anything that could be done by the body would be
   cheerfully attempted!

   But true religion is spiritual and carnal men cannot get at it--it is
   high above and out of their sight. They ask us "How can we be saved?"
   We tell them. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ." Then they reply, "But
   what is this, believing?" and they try and make believing into a kind
   of hard mechanical action of the understanding by which it receives
   certain facts about Christ, just as it believes in Roman or Grecian
   history. They do not grip at the idea that it is the heart's resting
   upon Christ. When we begin to preach repentance and faith, they appear
   to be in a fog--they cannot get at our meaning because they are
   prejudiced by other modes of thought. Hence it is that the slight
   healing which comes of formalism and ceremonies, seeing it deals with
   outward manipulations, at once attracts them.

   But, my dear Hearers, let me warn you with all the energy I possess
   against ever being satisfied with any of the slight healings that are
   cried up nowadays! They will all end in disappointment, as sure as you
   are living men! I could wish that they might speedily end so you could
   begin again and begin aright. Believe me, sickness is often a time when
   a man is led to turn over the pages of his past life, to see whether
   they will bear inspection. It will be a fearful thing when you are
   racked with pain and depressed in spirit to see all your evidences
   blotted and blurred--and all your hopes of Heaven cancelled by the hand
   of the Truth of God before your sight! Suffering times call for
   realities, solid facts, eternal verities-- for then it is that dark
   thoughts crowd in upon the soul and anxious questions which must and
   will have an answer!

   Then Conscience talks in this fashion--"You must be born again." Are
   you born again? "Without shedding of blood there is no remission of
   sin." Has that blood-shedding ever come near to you? Such thoughts as
   these gather around the spirit in the dead of night and haunt the soul
   in the weary watches, when you toss to and fro and cannot sleep. Unless
   you fix your eyes upon the Cross and can answer, "I have believed in
   Jesus for salvation and I still believe in Him. I have forsaken every
   evil way and I am still striving against sin. I am a renewed man. I am
   struggling to the Light of God and struggling up to purity and to my
   God"--unless, I say, you can give such firm and solid answers, there
   will be hard times for you and deep depressions far more grievous than
   physical pain could possibly bring to you. I pray you, therefore, do
   not put off making sure work for eternity. Remember that if you pass
   through this life deceived, there will await you an awful undeceiving
   in the next world!

   I will not try to depict the man who finds himself lost forever, though
   he died in the odor of sanctity. What will be his horror, when he finds
   himself cast out and hears the Lord Jesus say, "I never knew you." Your
   minister knew you! The deacons knew you! The members knew you, but the
   Lord Jesus never did, for you had no heart-fellowship with Him and were
   not in heart a believer in Him! O Brothers and Sisters, if there is any
   error about your profession, get it right at once! Do not go on under a
   delusion! Surely you cannot wish to be puffed up with vain imaginations
   of hopes which are fallacious! Search, then, and see. Beg the Lord to
   search you and let your state before Him be in all things according to
   His Truth. Time flies, and so does my strength, and therefore we must
   hasten to the second point.

   II. BE IT OURS TO SEEK TRUE HEALING. But then, as we have already said,
   this true healing must be radical.

   Oh, pray to have it so! The healing which we need must go to the root
   of the business and work a thorough change. Such a work is described in
   Scripture as a creation--"created anew in Christ Jesus"--it must be a
   resurrection. "And you has He quickened, who were dead in trespasses
   and sins." Now I ask you, my dear Brothers and Sisters, whether you can
   undertake this? Creation and resurrection--do these lie in your power?
   You can do nothing of the kind! And so you are driven to my second
   text, "O Lord, heal me, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be
   saved."

   Be it known unto every one of you, men and women, that you must be the
   subjects of a Divine Power by which you must be as totally changed as
   if you had been annihilated and then created anew! By this Divine
   agency you must be as

   really changed as if you were dead and buried and then were raised
   again from the dead. There is no soul-healing, no soul-saving apart
   from this! Does this strike you with despair? I am glad of it, for this
   kind of despair is next door to eternal hope. When a man despairs of
   himself, he will begin to trust in his God, Oh that we might each one
   lie at Christ's feet as dead till He shall touch us and say, "Live."
   Truly, I desire no life but that which He gives. I would be quickened
   by His Spirit and find in Him my life, my all!

   Now go a step further. The healing we need must be a healing from the
   guilt of sin. My anxious Friend, you must no longer be guilty--you must
   be free from fault. Every offense you have ever committed must be
   washed right out, even the least stain of it must vanish and it must be
   as though it had never been! And you must be as though you never had
   offended at all! "How can that be?" you ask. It is clear it cannot be
   by anything that you can do and this, again, drives you to the prayer
   of my text, "Heal me, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be
   saved." How can it be? Only by the atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ
   our Savior! He took the sin of His people upon Him. He became their
   Substitute and Representative. He bore their iniquity and was made a
   curse for them--and in consequence they are set free, cleared and
   justified!

   What a word was that, "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against
   the Man that is My Fellow, says the Lord of Hosts." Beneath that sword,
   our Shepherd offered up His life, a ransom for the flock! By one
   tremendous Sacrifice which He offered unto the Father, the Lord Jesus
   delivered all His redeemed! Look to Jesus Christ and in a moment your
   sins have ceased to be! "With His stripes we are healed." Hallelujah!
   The day comes when the sins of Jacob shall be sought for and they shall
   not be found! Yes, they shall not be, says the Lord. Blessed healing
   this! Who but a Divine Physician could work such a cure? This is pardon
   worthy of a God!

   But you must not only be free from sin, you must be freed from
   sinfulness--a work must be worked in you, my dear Brothers and Sisters,
   and in me, by which we shall be clean rid of every tendency to do evil.
   We cannot enter into Heaven with sinful tendencies--corruption and
   depravity cannot be endured before the Throne of the thrice holy
   Jehovah! The very roots and rootlets of sin must come out of the nature
   which is to share the abode of God. Does not this drive you to despair?
   Does not this make you cry, "Heal me, O God, and I shall be healed;
   save me, and I shall be saved"? It ought to do so and, in doing so it
   will work your safety! In answer to your cry, the eternal Spirit shall
   come upon you, creating you anew in Christ Jesus! He shall come and
   dwell in you and shall break down the reigning power of sin, putting it
   beneath your feet.

   Though this defeated foe shall strive and struggle like a serpent with
   his back broken, yet it has its death wound and cannot regain its
   former dominion. It will struggle so long as you are in this life, but
   it must ultimately die, and you shall attain perfection--

   "Sin, my worst enemy before,

   Shall vex my eyes and ears no more!

   My inward foes shall all be slain,

   Nor Satan break my peace again." No tendency to sin, no affection
   towards evil, no fear of relapse, nor danger of apostasy shall remain,
   but there shall be in us the living and incorruptible Seed and we shall
   be the members of Christ's body! We shall be as pure as Adam when he
   was first created--we shall have about us a purity superior to that of
   mere creation--a purity produced by the infusion of the Divine life. We
   came into this world defiled by original sin, but every trace of this
   will vanish through the work of the Spirit of God and the washing in
   the precious blood! This is a work which can only be worked in us by
   God, Himself. Oh to be so saved that we can survive Divine inspection,
   a Divine inspection by which every spot would be revealed if spots were
   there--but we shall be without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing! It
   is most desirable to be so healed in soul as to stand the test of this
   present life.

   I have known friends discharged from the hospital as healed of disease
   who were bitterly disappointed when they came into everyday life--a
   little exertion made them as ill as ever. A person had a piece of
   diseased bone in her wrist. It was taken out by the hospital surgeon
   and the arm seemed perfectly healed. But when she began to work, the
   old pain returned and it was evident that the old mischief was still
   there and that a part of the decayed bone remained. Thus some are
   saved, so they think, but it is only in seeming, for when they get into
   the world and are tried with temptation, they are just the same as they
   used to be. They have not received a practical salvation--and nothing
   but practical salvation is worth having.

   A sham cure is worse than none. If a bone is ill set it is often
   necessary to break it, again, and it sometimes seems to me that certain
   converts need their hearts to be broken again, that they may be truly
   comforted. If any man here has been healed, but his arm will not work
   for Jesus and for righteousness, it needs breaking again! And I should
   not mind if my sermon should break it, so long as he was driven to
   Christ to get it set in the right fashion. If you cannot resist the
   temptations of this life, depend upon it, your salvation is a mere
   myth! We need a salvation that will bear the test of sickness and the
   strain of death, so that a man may lie back on his bed and say, "I do
   not fear to die. Jesus Christ has made me perfectly whole and among the
   healed ones before His Throne I shall shortly stand and sing His
   praises world without end."

   Oh, my dear Hearers, could you die like that? Have you a hope which
   will bear the light of your last hours? If you have not, do not let
   this day close until you have found it! I beseech you, cry to Jesus, at
   once to save you in His own effectual way.

   III. I close by saying, LET US GO WHERE TRUE HEALING IS TO BE HAD. It
   is quite certain that God is able to heal us of all our sins, for He
   who created can restore. Whatever our diseases, nothing can surpass the
   power of Omnipotent Love. Blessed be the name of the Lord, no work of
   Grace can be beyond His will, for He delights in mercy. His name is
   Jehovah-Rophi, the Lord That Heals You, and He has given us a sweet
   word, "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely." You
   remember how David sang, "He sent His word and healed them, and
   delivered them from their destructions"? The Lord is so fond of healing
   sin-sick souls that He had but one Son and He made a Physician of Him
   that He might come and heal mankind of their deadly wounds!

   And He, being made a Physician, came down among us, and sought out for
   His patients, not the good and excellent, but the most guilty, for He
   said, "The whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I
   came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Jesus,
   then, the Beloved Physician, is able and willing to meet the case of
   every one of us! His wounds are an unfailing remedy. Oh, that you were
   willing to come to Him and spread your case before Him! Come at once!
   Even at this instant! Jesus certainly can meet your condition, though
   apart from Him it may be utterly hopeless.

   As I turned over my text while coming here, I was charmed with the
   encouragement which it offers to the very chief of sinners, for these
   may say to themselves, "Is it, after all, God's work to save? Well,
   then, He can save a great sinner as well as a little sinner!" If
   salvation were of works or of merits, then many persons would evidently
   be excluded from hope. But if it is entirely of Grace, then none are
   excluded! And if the power is found in God, and not in us, then the
   same power which can save the most moral young man can save the most
   dissolute and debauched person--and the same Grace which can save the
   godly matron can save the impious harlot! The power of God is equal to
   any miracle! The mercy of God can go any length!

   Tell it! Tell it that Jesus Christ is able to have compassion on the
   ignorant and to save those who are out of the way! Out of the way
   sinners, outrageous sinners, black sinners, scarlet sinners--they, too,
   may pray the prayer, "Heal me, and I shall be healed; save me, and I
   shall be saved." If it is of Grace, then surely hope is encouraged
   where otherwise despair might reign supreme! If it is of pure mercy,
   then the utmost guilt need not shut out a soul from Heaven. Would God,
   dear Friends, you would come and try the unfailing Grace of God in
   Christ Jesus, which is unto all and upon all them that believe!

   I know that while I am preaching, certain of you say, "He does not mean
   me: I am too great a sinner." On the other hand, another class imagines
   that they are not sinful enough, so they, also, fancy that the
   discourse is not meant for them. Oh that you would give up this wicked
   perversity and know that all the Truth of God that applies to you is
   meant for you! I have heard of Robert Burns, that, on one occasion when
   at church, he sat in a pew with a young lady whom he observed to be
   much affected by certain terrible passages of Scripture which the
   minister quoted in his sermon. The wicked wag scribbled on a piece of
   paper a verse which he passed to her. I fear that the substance of that
   verse has been whispered into many of your ears full often--

   "Fair maid, you need not take the hint, Nor idle texts pursue; 'Twas
   only sinners that he meant, Not angels such as you."

   This sermon is meant for those who think themselves angels as well as
   for those who know themselves to be sinners! Cease from all dreamy
   confidences! Awaken yourselves from proud self-content and come to
   Jesus, the Savior, who alone can save from sin and death!

   I love my text because it gives security for the future. "Heal me, and
   I shall be healed." Certain theologians appear to doubt the lasting
   nature of the Divine cure and fancy that Christ's patients may die,
   after all. Would they have us pray, "Lord, heal me, and I shall not be
   healed"? Yet that would be the way to pray if we may fall from Grace
   and perish! We do not believe in this questionable healing, but we
   pray, "Heal me, and I shall be healed." If you are saved by a priest or
   by yourself, you may be lost--but if God saves you--you never will be
   lost! That which God does, He does forever. The Lord never puts His
   hand to a creation which He leaves unfinished. He that is born again
   cannot be unborn! We may unravel all that is of Nature's weaving, but
   that which is God's workmanship defies the infernal powers! There
   stands the promise, sure forever-- "I give unto My sheep eternal life,
   and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My
   hand."

   Dear Friends, if you are saved, pray the Lord that you may be saved,
   indeed! And if you are not saved, get to Him and pray Him to begin His
   good work within your souls. I am often anxious about this
   congregation. I do not want to build up, in this place, a host of hopes
   that are ill-founded. I felt that I must come and deliver this message
   at this time, though I am quite unfit to be among you. I have not
   delivered it as I hoped to--still there it is--and unto God I commend
   it. I was told if I preached, this morning, I should suffer a month's
   relapse as the consequence of it. But I ran the risk because I could
   not be quiet till I had delivered my soul! Oh that the careless might
   be disquieted! Oh that the penitent might be encouraged! Let none of us
   excuse ourselves from self-examination!

   Do not let the preacher, or the deacons, or the workers in this Church
   deceive themselves! Let us get on the Rock and know that we are on it!
   Let us be true men--true to the core--sincere right through and
   through. Let us pray God that there may be a work of Grace in us and
   not the mere outgrowth of human will, fancy and self-flattery! If there
   are any who have not even felt the slight healing, I am glad they have
   not. May their wounds never be bound up till Jesus binds them! May none
   of us ever think of health unless it comes from beneath the wings of
   the Sun of Righteousness! May we all stand together and gaze with
   tearful eyes upon the Cross of our Lord! He is all my salvation, all my
   desire and all my praise! If I perish, it shall be at His feet! If I
   live, it shall be in His service. Amen!

A Feast for the Upright

   (No. 1659)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 14, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give Grace and
   Glory: no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly. O
   Lord of Hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in You!" Psalm 84:11,12.

   IN this sweet Sabbatic Psalm the writer rejoices in the House of God.
   He evidently loves the place of godly assembly, the place where prayer
   and praise were offered by the united tribes of his people. But,
   Brothers and Sisters, there was no superstition in this love. He loved
   the House of God because he loved the God of the house! His heart and
   flesh cried out, not for the altar and the candlestick, but for his
   God. True, his soul fainted for the courts of the Lord, but the reason
   was that he cried out for the living God, saying, "When shall I come
   and appear before God?" Brethren, it is well to take an interest in the
   place where you gather for worship. I am always glad when Brothers and
   Sisters are moved to contribute towards the necessary maintenance of
   the building and the provision for its cleanliness and propriety. I
   hate that God should be served in a slovenly way. Even the place where
   we meet to worship should show some sign of reverence for His name.

   But still, our respect for our place of assembly must never degenerate
   into a superstitious reverence for the mere structure--as though there
   were some peculiar sanctity about the spot--and prayer offered here
   would be more acceptable than elsewhere. The great objective of our
   desire must be to meet with God, Himself. In hearing, the point is to
   hear the voice of God! In singing, the charm is truly to praise the
   Most High! In prayer, the main objective is to plead with God and so to
   speak that our cry comes up before Him, even into His ears. Let us
   always remember this and never rest content with merely going to a set
   place. Let us reckon that we have failed if we have not met with God!
   Let us come up here with strong desire for communion with the Lord in
   spirit and in truth.

   The Psalmist also knew right well that the spiritual Law runs through
   everything. He perceived that character is an essential, not only to
   acceptable worship, but to all real blessedness. In our text he speaks
   not of those who visit the Temple, but of those who walk uprightly and
   trust in God. There is no necessary blessedness in visiting tabernacles
   and temples. In all assemblies for worship the question is, Who are
   they that gather? Are their hearts in God's ways? Are their souls
   thirsting after God? The promises are very rich, but to whom are the
   promises made? What if they are not made to us? Then, the richer they
   are, the more sorrowful will be our loss of them!

   Before I unfold the inexhaustible treasures of this marvelous portion
   of Scripture, I want to dwell upon this fact, that these things are for
   a special people. The blessing is to the man that walks uprightly--the
   true-hearted man whose course is sincere, righteous, honest and just.
   He stands firmly and he walks erect. He does not bend and lean towards
   the right or to the left. He has no sinister motives or crooked
   policies. He is straight as a line, and is not to be swayed by any side
   winds. It is a very suggestive figure--an upright man is not twisted or
   doubled up or wrongly inclined--or tortuous in his ways and thoughts.
   He stands on the square and is distinctly perpendicular. This is the
   man who will enjoy the blessing from the God of Israel!

   Sin is a twist and it is a twist that robs us of the blessing in our
   text. But, since no man is upright by nature, we are reminded of the
   way by which we come to be upright-- "O Lord of Hosts, blessed is the
   man that trusts in You." We must have faith as the groundwork of all.
   Then "faith works by love" and purifies the soul. And by this
   purification the man is made to walk uprightly. Oh, to be resting where
   God bids us rest, namely, in the atoning Sacrifice of our Lord Jesus!
   Oh, to be depending where all must depend--upon the faithfulness of the
   Covenant-making and the Covenant-keeping God! Such a man has a solid
   rock beneath his feet. He trusts in God and so he stands firmly and is
   able to walk uprightly because he has a firm foothold.

   Judge you, then, yourselves. Are you trusting in the Lord? Are you
   walking uprightly? If so, here is "a feast of fat things, of fat things
   full of marrow, of wines on the lees well-refined." I would say to
   every child of God who can claim the character I have been describing,
   come to the text and freely enjoy it! What? Does no star of hope shine
   in your mid-

   night sky? Do clouds surround you and thicken into an impenetrable
   gloom? Come to the text, for "the Lord God is a sun." Here is an end to
   all your darkness! When He appears, the night vanishes and your light
   has come! Are you in great danger? Do perils surround you--temptations
   from the world, assaults of Satan--the rising up of your own
   corruption? Do you feel as if you moved in the center of a fierce
   fight? Is it as much as you can do, even, to hope that you will escape
   the fiery dart?

   Come to the text, then, and behold how He that keeps Israel has
   provided for your safety! Read the blessed words, "The Lord God is a
   shield." He is a broad shield that shall cover you from head to foot
   and quench all the fiery darts of the Wicked One. Here is perfect
   safety for all who take Jehovah to be their Helper. "The Lord is your
   shade upon your right hand. The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the
   moon by night. The Lord shall preserve you from all evil: He shall
   preserve your soul." But perhaps you tell me that you feel empty of all
   good and dry of all joy. Spiritual life is at a very low ebb with you.
   You can scarcely believe, much less reach to full assurance. You
   scarcely feel enough life to exhibit the tenderness you sigh for and
   you cannot reach to the faith you desire. I hear your groans, but come
   along with you! Here is the exact word for you. "The Lord will give
   Grace." His rich free favor waits to bless the undeserving and it is so
   strong and influential that those who have nothing in themselves may at
   once receive every precious thing! The God of All Grace will give
   Grace!

   "Yes," you say, "I have Grace, but I find that the gracious life is a
   very struggling one. I am contending from day to day with my inward
   corruptions and, besides, the infirmities of old age have been creeping
   upon me for years and I feel them so bitterly that I wish for the wings
   of a dove that I might fly away and be at rest." Friend, you need not
   fly far! The text promises you the best possible rest. The Lord who
   says that He will give Grace now tells you that He will give Glory!
   Wait a little longer. The sun which shines more and more will come to
   perfect day. "It is better on before." Glory will soon be in your
   actual possession--much sooner than you think! Between you and Heaven
   there may be but a step! Perhaps before another sun has risen on the
   earth you may behold the face "of the King in His beauty in the land
   that is very far off." At any rate, here is comfort for you--the same
   Lord who will give Grace will also give Glory.

   Do I hear another Brother sighing because he is in the depths of
   poverty? And is that poverty not only of bread and of water, but a
   poverty of soul? Do you feel straitened in spirit and so weak that you
   can hardly call a promise your own? Yet, dear Brother, if you are
   trusting in the Lord and He has helped you to walk uprightly, do not
   hesitate, but come to the text and dip your bucket into this deep and
   overflowing well--and fill it up to the brim--for what does the text
   say? "No good thing will He withhold from those that walk uprightly."
   Here is everything for nothing! Everything for you! Everything to be
   had at once according as you shall require it. It is God's Word, not
   mine! God's own sure Word which gives you all this blessing. Come,
   then, quit the dust and the darkness. Mount into brightness and rejoice
   in the Lord, your God, who bids you shout for joy!

   Have you fears about the future? I need not stay to tell you how
   sweetly the text will lull them all to sleep. Yet suffer me these few
   sentences. Do you fear the darkness of future trial? The Lord God is
   your Sun! Do you fear dangers which lie before you in some new sphere
   upon which you are just entering? The Lord will be your Shield! Are
   there difficulties in your way? Will you need great wisdom and
   strength? God's Grace will be sufficient for you and His strength will
   be glorified in your weakness! Do you fear failure? Do you dread final
   apostasy? It shall not be! He who gives you Grace will, without fail,
   give you Glory!

   Between here and Heaven there is provender for all the flock of God so
   that they need not fear famishing on the road. He that leads them shall
   guide them into pastures that never wither and to fountains that are
   never dried up, for, "no good thing will He withhold from those that
   walk uprightly." Is not this a glorious text? It overpowers me! It is a
   gem of priceless value! I feel as if I could not place it in a proper
   setting, but must hold it up just as it is and turn it this way and
   that, and bid you mark how each facet flashes forth the light of
   Heaven! It is a true Kohinoor among the gems of promise! It is so many
   sided, so transparent, so brilliant it belongs to the King of kings and
   He bids us wear it this day!

   What shall I hope to say which will be worthy of this supreme
   Scripture? How can my words fitly set forth this Word of the Lord? It
   would not be an ill way of considering my text if I were to preach from
   it in this fashion. First let us observe what God is--"The Lord God is
   a sun and a shield." By nature He is both these to His people and as
   such He is ours, for is not this a leading article in the Covenant of
   Grace, "I will be their God"? "The Lord is my portion, says my soul."
   The Lord has given Himself to me as He is, even as Jehovah, the I AM!
   Is God omnipotent? He is almighty for His people. Is He omniscient? His
   wisdom cares for them. Is God omnipresent? Is God immutable? Is God
   eternal? Is God infinite? He is ours in all those respects!

   The Lord God is a sun and shield and, as Sun and Shield He belongs to
   those who are trusting in Him and walking uprightly. If we preached
   thus, our second head would be what God will give. The Lord will give
   Grace and Glory! He has given them, is giving them and will give them,
   for the tense may be taken as you choose. He always will give free
   favor and kindly aid. He has given you Grace up to now and done great
   things for you. And He will show you greater things than these--

   "His Grace will to the end Stronger and brighter shine. Nor present
   things, nor things to come, Shall quench the spark Divine." He will
   supply you with Grace and Glory us the generous grants of His love.
   They are not a wage, but a gift. "The wages of sin is death, but the
   gift of God is eternal life." Glory will come to you on free-Grace
   terms.

   And then there is, thirdly, what the Lord will withhold. And what is
   that? Why, nothing at all that is good, for "no good thing will He
   withhold." We have among us some men who are great at withholding. If
   they give, it costs them an effort. But if they withhold, their purse
   strings are in their natural condition. Our God never was a withholding
   God. He makes His sun to shine upon the evil and upon the good. Ever
   since that first day when "He spoke and it was done," He has gone on
   manifesting Himself to this world, pouring out Himself in goodness,
   spreading His own care and love over all so that He is to be found
   filling all space and sustaining all existence! God's blessedness
   delights in scattering blessings. To withhold would not enrich Him as
   to give does not impoverish Him. Especially to His saints does He
   abound. To them He gives all things. "No good thing will He withhold
   from those that walk uprightly."

   I am not going to preach from the text in that way. We shall survey it
   in another fashion. Here flows a living stream--bring your buckets with
   you! Take care that you do not come to this River of Life merely to
   gaze on its sur-face--the river of God is full of water and it is all
   intended for our use! Oh, for a hearty draft at this good hour! Here is
   enough and to spare! Make free with it, O you who trust in the Lord!

   I. First, then, out of five particulars, here are, for God's people,
   BLESSINGS IN THEIR FULLNESS, for, "the Lord God is a sun." The blaze of
   my text almost blinds me! It does not say, "God is light," though that
   is true, for He is light and in Him is no darkness at all. But the
   words are, "the Lord God is a sun." Then, if God is mine, I have not
   only light, but I have the Source of light. I have for my possession
   the central Sun from whom all light comes to this world! We have heard
   of one who received apples from a friend and was grateful. Another was
   more highly favored, for his friend planted his garden with fruit
   trees. You and I have fruit from God and therein we are favored. Yes,
   but we have the Lord, Himself, and thus we have the Tree of Life and a
   perpetual supply most fresh, sweet and constant!

   It is well to get a drink from a pitcher, but it is better to be like
   Isaac, who dwelt by the well, because then, if the pitcher becomes
   empty, there is an abiding supply from which to fill it. God is the
   Source of all conceivable good, yes, inconceivable blessing lie in Him
   and, as such, He belongs to His people! There might be light apart from
   the sun, but there could be no blessing apart from God! And, on the
   other hand, every sort of blessing is in God and nothing is lacking in
   Him. He who is all Good and the Source of all good, has made Himself
   our Divine possession. God is a sun--that is an infinity of blessing!

   No man among us can conceive the measure of the light and heat of the
   sun. I suppose that calculations have been made by which the heat of
   the sun has been thought to be estimated, but the calculations must be
   beyond all ordinary numeration. Concerning the sun--its light, heat and
   influence are beyond conception! Its light and heat have been
   continually streaming forth throughout many ages and yet they are
   unabated to this hour--all that has come forth of it is far less than
   that which still remains! For all practical purposes the light and heat
   of the sun are infinite and certainly in God all blessedness is
   absolutely infinite. There is no measuring it. We are lost. We can only
   say-- "Oh, the depths of the love and goodness of God!" In being heirs
   of God we possess all in all. There is no bound to our blessedness in
   God.

   Further, if God is called a sun, it is to let us know that we have
   obtained an immutability of blessedness, for He is "the Father of
   lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." God is
   not love, today, and hate, tomorrow-- He says, "I am God, I change
   not." There are said to be spots in the sun which diminish the light
   and heat which we receive, but there are no such spots in God! He
   shines on with the boundless fullness of His infinite love toward His
   people in Christ Jesus! "This God is our God forever and ever." If we
   were to live as long as Methuselah we should find His love and power
   and wisdom to be the same--and we might confidently count upon being
   blessed thereby.

   What treasures of mercy do you and I possess in being able to say, "O
   God, You are my God!" We have the source of mercy, the infinity of
   mercy and the immutability of mercy to be our own. There much must be
   added concerning God as

   a sun--that He is forever communicating His light and heat and
   excellence to all who are about Him. I cannot conceive the sun shut up
   within itself. An un-shining sun is a sun un-sunned! And a God that is
   not good and pouring forth His goodness has laid aside His Deity! It is
   contrary to the very notion and idea of an infinitely good God for Him
   to restrain His goodness and keep it back from His people!

   Therefore, Beloved, you have not only God supremely good, but God
   abundantly giving Himself out to His people! He is not a spring shut up
   and a fountain sealed, but a springhead always flowing in winter and in
   summer. Nothing in God is reserved from His believing people. He gives
   Himself to you in all His fullness. All your needs shall be abundantly
   satisfied out of the riches of His goodness. Has ever man such a task
   as I have in trying to speak of what is altogether unspeakable? Who
   shall fully extol the sun? Stand out in the open and look the sun full
   in the face for a little while--and when blindness threatens you, learn
   how little we can know of the greater Sun, the Sun of Righteousness!
   And if thought fails, what shall speech do? How can it be possible for
   men to speak aright on such a text as this-- "The Lord God is a

   sun"?

   Go, you cold words, and be exhaled in the presence of this central
   fire! Yet I can show you enough to let you see that there is more than
   I can show you! I can say enough to let you know that there is a great
   deal more than I can say or than you can hear! To speak on this theme
   calls for some of those words which they speak in Heaven in the full
   blaze of the Glory--words such as mortal tongues cannot compass! Fully
   to set forth the wondrous height and depth of this promise might need
   that same Spirit who of old dictated it to the Psalmist and placed it
   in the sacred page. "The Lord God is a sun"--here is blessedness in its
   fullness!

   II. Now, secondly--and this is a deeply interesting point--this
   glorious Word of God gives us BLESSINGS IN THEIR COUNTERBALANCE. Let me
   explain myself. One blessing alone might scarcely be a blessing, for in
   being too great a blessing it might crush us. We may have too much of a
   good thing. We need some other gift to balance the single benediction.
   So notice here, "The Lord God is a sun and shield." "Sun and shield"
   hang before my eyes like two golden scales! Each one adds value to the
   other! When God is a sun to His people, it may be He warms them into
   temporal prosperity with His bright beams so that their goods increase,
   their body is in health, their trade succeeds and their children are
   spared. They are grateful to God and joyful because of the blessings
   which He has bestowed upon them.

   He gives them their heart's desire. He permits them to enjoy the
   blessing of this life as well as the promise of the life that is to
   come. Yet danger lurks here! You have heard of sunstroke and prosperous
   persons are very apt to feel it. Our poor heads cannot bear the full
   beams of the sun of prosperity--we are smitten down with pride, or
   carelessness, or worldliness, or some other evil. It is trying for the
   soul to bask in the unclouded sun. Temporal gains are blessings in
   themselves, but such is our poor nature that we do not make blessings
   of them, but we often make idols of them and then they become curses!

   What a sweet mercy it is that when God prospers His children, and is a
   sun to them, He comes in at the same time and acts as their shield! The
   same God who is the pillar of fire to the hosts of Israel is also their
   pillar of cloud! Our hymn well puts it--

   "He has been my joy in woe,

   Cheered my heart when it was low,

   And with warnings softly sad,

   Calmed my heart when it was glad." When everything is bright with us,
   the Lord knows how to sober His children's spirits so that they use,
   but do not abuse, the things of this life. Even when they most abound
   with worldly joys, He makes His people feel that these are not their
   heart's joy. He shades us from the noxious effect of wealth and
   content. He makes rich and adds no sorrow therewith. He suffers not the
   sun to smite us by day. Is not this a gracious style of counterbalance?

   "The Lord God is a sun and shield," too, when He shines upon us
   spiritually. Oh, how I rejoice in the sunny side of spiritual life! I
   do not always get it, but when I do reach it, how happy I am! My heart
   is ready, like the gnats in the sunbeams, to dance up and down with
   intense delight! When God shines upon our soul, what gladness! What
   ecstasy! Then, truly, we would hardly change places with the
   angels--and as for kings and princes--we pity them! My God, lift up the
   light of Your Countenance upon me and I ask no more! It is Heaven
   below!

   I know some of my Brothers and Sisters are often moping in the dungeon,
   but I guarantee you that when they do get out, they can dance with the
   nimblest and they call for the merriest tunes, too, for theirs is no
   second-rate delight! It is a great mercy that when God gives His people
   great spiritual joys He usually gives them a humbling sense of
   themselves at the same time. The shadow of their former depressions
   prevents their being unduly excited with their present joy, or else

   the forecast of another chastisement is given them and this sobers them
   when they are inclined to be lifted up. The Lord has ways and means of
   letting His people be as happy as they can be--but yet not happier than
   they ought to be! He gives them Grace so that they can be full of
   assurance and yet full of holy fear--always rejoicing and yet never
   presuming-- lifted up and yet lying low before the Lord.

   He gives them a well-mixed experience and so forms an all-round
   character. While He is, to them, a sun producing rapid growth, He is
   also a shield forbidding their being burned up. He is their great
   Benefactor, but also their wise Chas-tener--and in both, alike, He
   blesses them! Look at the text another way. When the sun shines upon a
   man, he is made the more conspicuous by it. Suppose a hostile army to
   be down in the plain and a soldier in our ranks is sent upon some
   errand by his captain. He must pass along the hillside. The sun shines
   upon him as he tries to make his way among the rocks and trees.

   Had it been night, he could have moved safely, but now we fear that the
   enemy will surely pick him off, for the sunshine has made him
   conspicuous. He will have need to be shielded from the many cruel eyes.
   Christian men are made conspicuous by the very fact of their possessing
   God's Grace. You are the light of the world and a light must be seen! A
   city set on a hill cannot be hidden. If God gives you light, He means
   that light to be seen--and the more light He gives you, the more
   conspicuous you will be. He is your sun and He shines upon you--you
   reflect His light and so become, yourself, a light--and in so doing you
   run necessary risks. The more brightly you shine, the more will Satan
   and the world try to quench your light. This, then, is your comfort.
   The Lord God who is a sun to you will also be a shield to you. Did He
   not say to Abraham, "Fear not, I am your shield, and your exceeding
   great reward"? He will defend you against the dangers of publicity, or
   even of popularity! And if He sets you upon a high place, He will make
   your feet like the feet of a gazelle, so that you shall stand upon your
   high places.

   Consider the text, again, still keeping to this idea of counterbalance.
   "The Lord God is a sun" and a sun manifests a thing, and this
   manifestation is not always a joy to us, but we need a defense with it.
   When the Lord shines in upon the heart of His people, they begin to see
   their sin, their guilt, their fall, their corruption--and then the Lord
   is a shield-- and they are not overcome by the discovery! When they see
   the danger, at the same time they see the defense. And when they see
   the disease they see the remedy. It is a blessed thing not to see sin
   unless, at the same time, we see the Savior. It is a blessed thing not
   to have a sense of weakness in self unless it is accompanied with a
   sense of strength in the Lord. These two things most wisely balance
   each other, otherwise the revealing Spirit of God, in showing us so
   much of our evil hearts, might almost drive us mad!

   If a man could see all his past sin and all his present danger. If he
   could see all the trials of his future life, he might lie down in
   despair, unless, at the same time, he was made to perceive that if the
   Lord is a sun to reveal our danger, He is also a shield to secure our
   safety! The Lord, thus, in His Grace, abounds toward us in all wisdom
   and prudence. He multiplies the value of the blessing by His wise way
   of dispensing it. He gives us the bitter medicine, but He also allots
   us the sweet cordial. He will sometimes chide, but He will not always
   do so. He will not give us too much of one blessing lest it spoil and
   breed overindulgence. He will give us another favor which shall make up
   a healthful mixture. Yes, thus He does with all things, so that they
   work together for our good. Dwell on my text and especially on this
   noteworthy point in it--blessings in their counterbalance.

   III. Very briefly let me submit to you the third idea, namely,
   BLESSINGS IN THEIR ORDER, for there is a due and meet succession in my
   text. "The Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give Grace and
   Glory." The Lord is to us first, a sun and then a shield. Remember how
   David puts it elsewhere--"The Lord is my light and my salvation." Light
   first, salvation next! He does not save us in the dark, neither does He
   shield us in the dark. He gives enough sunlight to let us see the
   danger that we may appreciate the defense. We are not to shut our eyes
   and so find safety, but we are to see the evil and hide ourselves!
   Ought we not to be very grateful to God that He so orders our affairs?
   Ours is not a blind faith, receiving an unknown salvation from evils
   which are unperceived--this would be a poor form of life at best. No,
   the favor received is valued because its necessity is perceived. The
   heavenly Sun lights up our souls and makes us see our ruin and lie down
   in the dust of self-despair. And then it is that Grace brings forth the
   Shield which covers us so that we are no more afraid, but rejoice in
   the glorious Lord as the God of our salvation.

   Then notice the order of the next two things--Grace and Glory--not
   Glory first. That could not be. We are not fit for it. Neither in body
   nor in soul are we fit for Glory before Grace. We could not possibly
   receive Glory while we are sinners, for a glorified sinner would be a
   strange sight! Grace must first blot out our sin. To take the rebel
   from the prison and put him among the children would be dangerous work
   unless his crime were pardoned and reconciled to his king. Grace must
   come in to change the nature. We could not enter Glory or enjoy it by
   any possibility while we are sin-

   ful at heart. An unregenerate heart could not enter into the joy of the
   Lord. Only the pure in heart can see God--carnal eyes are blind to
   spiritual things. Grace must renew us or Glory cannot receive us. Grace
   must change, regenerate, sanctify, or we cannot take our places among
   the perfected ones.

   Glory without Grace would be mockery! The prepared place would be no
   Heaven if the people were not also prepared. As in this case there is
   order, you will find it so in all the arrangements of the Lord's House.
   One blessing is a step-pingstone to another. The holy leads on to the
   holiest. First the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.
   The Lord gives mercies in succession and He never gives you number two
   till you have been qualified for it by receiving number one! "They go
   from strength to strength." He gives life, and then life more
   abundantly. First Grace and then Grace upon Grace. God abounds towards
   us in all wisdom and prudence, leading us, as we do our boys, from
   their first-class books up to their classics, and taking care to ground
   us in each successive ascent of knowledge.

   Step by step we rise towards God, until at last we shall see the
   Savior's face and shall be like He! Blessings in their order. Treasure
   this up, for it may be a ground of comfort to you. When you get
   clamoring for number seven, it may, perhaps, calm you a little if you
   remember that you must first have number six. Plod on step by step.
   Walk without fainting from one stage to another and you shall surely
   come unto the Mountain of God.

   IV. Fourthly, and again briefly, BLESSINGS IN PREPARATION AND BLESSINGS
   IN MATURITY. "The Lord will give Grace and Glory." Grace is Glory in
   the bud--you shall see the rod of Aaron full of blooming Graces! But
   this is not all--Glory is Grace in ripe fruit--the rod shall bear ripe
   almonds. The Lord will give you both the dawn and the noon, the Alpha
   and the Omega, Grace and Glory. Let us be very grateful that God deals
   in preparatory mercies. If He had provided Heaven and we were to make
   ourselves fit for it, we should never get there! Yes, and there are
   many stages of spiritual experience which are not to be attained unless
   God gives us preliminary educating Grace to come at them. The blessing
   is that all that is necessary to reach any gracious attainment is as
   much promised as the blessing itself!

   Is it so, my poor Friend, that you cannot, this morning, lay hold of a
   promise? You are such a babe in Grace. Well, our heavenly Father has an
   infant class in His school and a nursery in His house--He will teach
   you as a child and give you a child's portion upon which you shall feed
   and by which you shall grow! Do not be afraid to ask of God the
   beginnings of things. I know that sometimes in our prayers we feel that
   we are so blameworthy for our stupidity that we hardly dare ask to be
   taught the simple Truths which we ought to know. But we must not give
   way to this proud humility! We must beg, even, to be taught our A B Cs.

   Suppose we need to be helped to overcome an irritable temper, let us
   not be ashamed to acknowledge the need, but confess it and pray for
   help. Do we need Grace to bear our little daily trials? Then let us
   seek everyday Grace. Ask for a babe's blessings, for God is prepared to
   give them! Does He not say, "I taught Ephraim to go, taking them by
   their arms"? "The Lord will give Grace and Glory." Brothers and
   Sisters, we shall need much training to fit us to sing among the
   choristers above! Discords and false notes abound! We must be tutored
   out of them into a richness of sweet tones and ordered harmonies. If we
   look into ourselves carefully, we shall be shocked with the sight of
   our own unworthiness to mingle with perfect beings. I do not know how
   you feel about yourselves, but I grow worse and worse in my own
   judgment. I hope that I am more sanctified in many respects, but I am
   also more conscious of my need of fuller sanctification.

   The fact is that the more Light of God a soul obtains, the more it
   perceives its darkness and laments it. The more God makes you holy, the
   more unholy you will judge yourself to be. No man groans so deeply, "O
   wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?" as the man who is nearest to complete deliverance from all
   evil! The last relics of sin are more horrible to the godly man than
   the full empire of sin to the newly awakened. Even the very thought of
   sin--the flitting of it through his soul like a bird across the
   sky--becomes a calamity to the full-grown saint and he cries out
   against it. "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
   truth is not in us." He who glories that he is perfectly sanctified
   must either have lowered the standard of holiness or else he has an
   exaggerated conceit of his own excellence.

   He who does not daily struggle against sin is in darkness and error and
   I fear the life of God is not in his soul. In proportion as God has
   dealt with a man, he will cry out for a something yet beyond him and
   press forward to that which is before. Oh, how I long to be perfectly
   rid of sin and of every liability to fall into it! And here is the
   mercy--that the Lord will give Grace. All the Grace that is needed to
   make you absolutely perfect, God will bestow. He will reveal His
   righteousness from faith to faith and we shall go from Grace to Grace.
   Faith shall lead on to full assurance--hope shall brighten into
   expectancy--love shall flame into burning zeal and so we shall rise on
   eagles' wings from Grace to Glory! Not only the light of the lamp in
   its full brilliance, but the wick and the oil and the trimming, the
   Lord will give. Fur-

   thermore, the Lord will not deny you the maturity, namely, Glory. He
   who gives us breakfast in Grace will cause us to sup with Him in Glory!

   Now, here I am altogether beaten. What shall I say of Glory? What do I
   know of it? Matthew Wilks once said, "Man is the glory of the world;
   the soul is the glory of man; Grace is the glory of the soul; and
   Heaven is the Glory of Grace." This is true, but still, what do any of
   us know of Glory in its heavenly sense? The Lord will give us nothing
   less than Glory! We deserve shame--He will give us Glory! We deserve
   misery, but He will give us Glory. We deserve condemnation, but He will
   give us Glory! We deserve death and Hell, but He will give us Glory!
   What is Glory? He that has been in Heaven five minutes can tell you
   better than the sagest divine that lives and yet he could not tell you!
   No, the angels could not tell you--you would not understand them!

   What is Glory? You must enjoy it to know it. Glory is not merely rest,
   happiness, wealth, safety--it is honor, victory, immortality, triumph!
   You know what men call, "glory," here below. The people climb to the
   housetops, throng the streets and sound the clarions because a
   conqueror has returned from war and brings with him huge spoils. See
   how he stands erect, drawn in his chariot by milk-white steeds. Follow
   him up the Via Sacra to the Capitol at Rome. Men count him happy
   because he is surrounded with glory. What is this glory? Smoke, noise,
   dust and oblivion--that is all.

   But Glory, as the Lord uses the term, what is it? It is that which
   surrounds Himself, for He is the King of Glory! It is that which crowns
   every attribute, for we read of the Glory of His power and the Glory of
   His Grace. It is the outcome of all His plans and thoughts and works,
   for in all things He is glorified! It is that which His dear Son
   inherits, for He has entered into His Glory. We shall be with Him where
   He is and shall behold His Glory! Yes, it is of this unutterable thing
   that we shall partake, and that so soon! "Wherefore comfort one another
   with these words."

   V. Now, fifthly and finally, BLESSINGS IN THEIR UNIVERSALITY. I have
   noticed that lawyers, who will always go into particulars as much as
   they can in their deeds--an excellent method of adding to their
   fees--usually are obliged to sum up with a general clause which
   includes all they have said and all they ought to have said! They use
   some sweeping final sentence to comprehend all the mentionable and
   unmentionables--all that can be remembered and all that might be
   forgotten! Now, the last part of my text is of that character--"No good
   thing will He withhold from those that walk uprightly."

   Is there some good thing which does not come to us by the Lord's being
   our Sun? We shall not lose on that account. Is there another good thing
   which cannot be included in God's being our Shield? We shall not be
   deprived of that! Is there some good thing that cannot be comprehended
   in Grace? I cannot imagine what it can be, but if there is such a
   thing, we shall not miss even that! Is there some good thing that is
   not comprehended, even, in Glory? Well, it does not matter, we shall
   have it, for here stands the boundless promise--"No good thing will He
   withhold from those that walk uprightly."

   "Well," says someone, "but God has denied me many good things!" Yes,
   then they would not be good things to you! What has God done to you,
   then? "He has made me to be sickly in body, He has caused me to be
   poor, and I am tried in many ways." In this He has fulfilled His Word
   that no good thing should be withheld from you. I have known a father
   who boasted that he never laid a hand on his children by way of
   chastising them. I sometimes wished that he had done so, for his
   children were a sad plague to all who called at the house. Now, that
   father was withholding a good thing from his children--a touch of the
   birch would have been most wholesome! Our heavenly Father never says of
   any of His elect, "I never laid a hand upon them"--but it is written,
   "As many as I love I rebuke and chasten."

   God had one Son without sin, but He never had a son without
   chastisement! O you who are tried and afflicted, the Lord has not
   withheld from you the blessing of His rod! Accept trials from God and
   believe that they are tokens of His love. Is there anything you wish
   for and cannot get it from God? Then, depend upon it, it would not be a
   good thing for you! Is there any apparently evil thing which comes to
   you plenteously and you would gladly avoid it? Depend upon it, it
   really is a good thing or else the Lord would not have sent it to you!
   "Alas," cries one, "there are many good things which I have not
   received." Whose fault is that? What does the text say? It does not
   say, "I will force all My children to enjoy every good thing." No, but,
   "No good thing will He withhold."

   There are thousands of mercies that we do not enjoy, not because they
   are withheld, but because we do not take them! We are not straitened in
   God, but in ourselves. We are empty because we do not accept the
   fullness of Christ. If we were to be introduced into some of the depots
   in London that are full of articles most rich and rare, and the owners
   were to say, "Now, take whatever you please," we should help ourselves
   with a degree of liberality. But when the Lord takes us into the
   storehouses of His Grace, we have not faith enough to ask for large
   things! We might have 10 times as much--10,000 times as much--if we
   would. Many of God's people are pining on a pittance when they might
   feast in

   plenty. They are eating the coarsest meal and wearing the roughest
   garment--I mean spiritually--and going about sighing and crying! They
   are doubting and fearing and all the while, there is the bread of
   Heaven on the table for them, and the robe of Christ's righteousness is
   prepared for them to wear! They might dwell at Heaven's gate, but they
   condemn themselves to the dunghill!

   Come, Brothers and Sisters, let us change all this! If the Lord has
   said, "No good thing will I withhold," let us put Him to the test!
   Among other things, let us ask Him to give us more joy in the Lord--a
   fuller assurance and confidence in Him--and He will give it to us. Do
   not let us be poor by self-inflicted poverty, but let us rise to the
   riches which are presented to us in this blessed text. I wish I knew
   how to preach from it, but pray, take an hour this afternoon and do
   with the text as the cow does with the grass when she has been round
   the meadow and satisfied herself. She lies down and chews the cud. If
   you will ruminate by meditation you will find more in the text than I
   shall ever be able to bring out of it. May the Lord feed you upon this
   choice portion, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Perpetuity of the Law of God

   (No. 1660)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 21, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
   tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law till all is fulfilled."
   Matthew 5:18.

   IT has been said that he who understands the two Covenants is a
   theologian and this is, no doubt, true. I may also say that the man who
   knows the relative positions of the Law and of the Gospel has the keys
   of the situation in the matter of doctrine. The relationship of the Law
   to myself and how it condemns me--the relationship of the Gospel to
   myself and how, if I am a Believer, it justifies me--these are two
   points which every Christian man should clearly understand. He should
   not "see men as trees walking" in this department, or else he may cause
   himself great sorrow and fall into errors which will be grievous to his
   heart and injurious to his life. To form a mingle-mangle of Law and
   Gospel is to teach that which is neither Law nor Gospel, but the
   opposite of both. May the Spirit of God be our teacher and the Word of
   God be our lesson book--and then we shall not err.

   Very great mistakes have been made about the Law. Not long ago there
   were those about us who affirmed that the Law is utterly abrogated and
   abolished. They openly taught that Believers were not bound to make the
   moral Law the rule of their lives. What would have been sin in other
   men they counted not to be sin in themselves. From such Antinomi-anism
   as that, may God deliver us! We are not under the Law as the method of
   salvation, but we delight to see the Law in the hand of Christ and
   desire to obey the Lord in all things. Others have been met with who
   have taught that Jesus mitigated and softened down the Law and they
   have, in effect, said that the perfect Law of God was too hard for
   imperfect beings and, therefore, God has given us a milder and easier
   rule. These tread dangerously upon the verge of terrible error,
   although we believe that they are little aware of it.

   Alas, we have met with authors who have gone much further than this and
   have railed at the Law. Oh, the hard words that I have sometimes read
   against the holy Law of God! How very unlike those which the Apostle
   used when he said, "The Law is holy, and the commandment holy, and
   just, and good." How different from the reverent spirit which made him
   say-- "I delight in the Law of God after the inward man." You know how
   David loved the Law of God and sang its praises all through the longest
   of the Psalms. The heart of every real Christian is most reverent
   towards the Law of the Lord. It is perfect, no, it is perfection
   itself! We believe that we shall never have reached perfection till we
   are perfectly conformed to it. A sanctification which stops short of
   perfect conformity to the Law cannot truthfully be called perfect
   sanctification, for every lack of exact conformity to the perfect Law
   is sin.

   May the Spirit of God help us while, in imitation of our Lord Jesus, we
   endeavor to magnify the Law. I gather from our text two things upon
   which I shall speak at this time. The first is that the Law of God is
   perpetual--"Till Heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in
   no wise pass from the Law." The meaning is that even in the least point
   it must abide till it is all fulfilled. Secondly, we perceive that the
   Law of God must be fulfilled--Not "one jot or one tittle shall pass
   from the Law, till all IS fulfilled." He who came to bring in the
   Gospel dispensation here asserts that He has not come to destroy the
   Law, but to fulfill it.

   I. First--THE LAW OF GOD MUST BE PERPETUAL. There is no abrogation of
   it, nor amendment of it. It is not to be toned down or adjusted to our
   fallen condition, but every one of the Lord's righteous judgments
   abides forever. I would urge three reasons which will establish this
   teaching. In the first place our Lord Jesus declares that He did not
   come to abolish it. His words are most exact--"Think not that I am come
   to destroy the Law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
   fulfill." And Paul tells us with regard to the Gospel, "Do we then make
   void the Law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the Law"
   (Rom. 3:31). The Gospel is the means of the firm establishment and
   vindication of the Law of God. Jesus did not come to change the Law,
   but He came to explain it, and that very fact shows that it remains,
   for there is no need to explain that which is abrogated.

   Upon one particular point in which there happened to be a little
   ceremonialism involved, namely, the keeping of the Sabbath, our Lord
   enlarged and showed that the Jewish idea was not the true one. The
   Pharisees forbade even the doing

   of works of necessity and mercy, such as rubbing ears of corn to
   satisfy hunger and healing the sick. Our Lord Jesus showed that it was
   not at all according to the mind of God to forbid these things. In
   straining over the letter and carrying an outward observance to excess,
   they had missed the spirit of the Sabbath Law, which suggested works of
   piety such as truly hallow the day. He showed that Sabbatic rest was
   not mere inaction, and He said, "My Father works hitherto, and I work."
   He pointed to the priests who labored hard at offering sacrifices and
   said of them, "the priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath and are
   blameless." They were doing Divine service and were within the Law.

   To meet the popular error, He took care to do some of His greatest
   miracles upon the Sabbath--and though this excited great wrath against
   Him, as though He were a Law-breaker, yet He did it on purpose that
   they might see that the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the
   Sabbath--and that it is meant to be a day for doing that which honors
   God and blesses men! O that men knew how to keep the spiritual Sabbath
   by an easing from all servile work and from all work done for self! The
   rest of faith is the true Sabbath and the service of God is the most
   acceptable hallowing of the day. Oh that the day were wholly spent in
   serving God and doing good!

   The sum of our Lord's teaching was that works of necessity, works of
   mercy and works of piety are lawful on the Sabbath. He explained the
   Law in that point and in others, yet that explanation did not alter the
   command, but only removed the rust of tradition which had settled upon
   it. By thus explaining the Law, He confirmed it! He could not have
   meant to abolish it or He would not have needed to expound it. In
   addition to explaining it, the Master went further-- He pointed out its
   spiritual character. This the Jews had not observed. They thought, for
   instance, that the command "You shall not kill" simply forbade murder
   and manslaughter. But the Savior showed that anger without cause
   violates the Law of God and that hard words and cursing--and all other
   displays of enmity and malice--are forbidden by the Commandment.

   They knew that they might not commit adultery, but it did not enter
   into their minds that a lascivious desire would be an offense against
   the precept till the Savior said, "He that looks upon a woman to lust
   after her commits adultery with her already in his heart." He showed
   that the thought of evil is sin; that an unclean imagination pollutes
   the heart; that a wanton wish is guilt in the eyes of the Most High!
   Assuredly this was no abrogation of the Law of God--it was a wonderful
   exhibition of its far-reaching sovereignty and of its searching
   character! The Pharisees fancied that if they kept their hands, their
   feet and their tongues, all was done. But Jesus showed that thought,
   imagination, desire, memory-- everything--must be brought into
   subjection to the will of God or else the Law was not fulfilled.

   What a searching and humbling doctrine is this! If the Law of the Lord
   reaches to the inward parts, who among us can, by nature, abide its
   judgment? Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from secret faults!
   The Ten Commandments are full of meaning--meaning which many seem to
   ignore. For instance, many a man will allow in and around his house
   inattention to the rules of health and sanitary precaution, but it does
   not occur to him that he is trampling on the commandments--"You shall
   not kill." Yet this rule forbids our doing anything which may cause
   injury to our neighbor's health and so deprive him of life. Many a
   deadly manufactured article; many an ill-ventilated shop; many a
   business with hours of excessive length is a standing breach of this
   Commandment!

   Shall I say less of drinks, which lead so speedily to disease and death
   and crowd our cemeteries with untimely graves? So, too, in reference to
   another precept--some persons will repeat songs and stories which are
   suggestive of unclean-ness--I wish that this were not so common as it
   is. Do they not know that an unchaste word, a double meaning, a sly
   hint of lust all come under the Commandment, "You shall not commit
   adultery"? It is so according to the teaching of our Lord Jesus! Oh,
   talk not to me about our Lord's having brought in a milder Law because
   man could not keep the Decalogue, for He has done nothing of the kind!
   "His fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor." "Who
   may abide the day of His coming? For He is like a refiner's fire and
   like fullers' soap."

   Let us not dare to dream that God had given us a perfect Law which we
   poor creatures could not keep and that, therefore, He has corrected His
   legislature and sent His Son to put us under a relaxed discipline!
   Nothing of the sort! The Lord Jesus Christ has, on the contrary, shown
   how intimately the Law of God surrounds and enters into our inward
   parts, so as to convict us of sin within even if we seem clean on the
   outside. Ah me, this Law is high! I cannot attain to it! It surrounds
   me everywhere; it tracks me to my bed and my board; it follows my steps
   and marks my ways wherever I may be! No moment does it cease to govern
   and demand obedience. O God, I am everywhere condemned, for everywhere
   Your Law reveals to me my serious deviations from the way of
   righteousness and shows me how far short I come of Your Glory. Have
   pity on Your servant, for I fly to the Gospel which has done for me
   what the Law could never do--

   "To see the Law by Christ fulfilled, And hear His pardoning voice,

   Changes a slave into a child, And duty into choice.'

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, in addition to explaining the Law and pointing
   out its spiritual character, also unveiled its living essence, for when
   one asked Him "Which is the great Commandment in the Law?" He said,
   "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
   your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great
   Commandment. And the second is like unto it; You shall love your
   neighbor as yourself. On these two Commandments hang all the Law and
   the prophets." In other words, He has told us, "All the Law is
   fulfilled in this--you shall love." There is the pith and marrow of it!
   Does any man say to me, "You see, then, instead of the Ten
   Commandments, we have received the two commandments and these are much
   easier." I answer that this reading of the Law of God is not in the
   least easier!

   Such a remark implies a lack of thought and experience. Those two
   precepts comprehend the 10 at their fullest extent and cannot be
   regarded as the erasure of a jot or tittle of them. Whatever
   difficulties surround the Ten Commandments, are equally found in the
   two, which are their sum and substance. If you love God with all your
   heart, you must keep the first table--and if you love your neighbor as
   yourself you must keep the second table. If any suppose that the Law of
   Love is an adaptation of the moral Law to man's fallen condition, they
   greatly err. I can only say that the supposed adaptation is no more
   adapted to us than the original Law. If there could be conceived to be
   any difference in difficulty, it might be easier to keep the 10 than
   the two, for if we go no deeper than the letter, the two are the more
   exacting, since they deal with the heart, soul and mind.

   The Ten Commandments mean all that the two express. But if we forget
   this and only look at the wording of them, I say, it is harder for a
   man to love God with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his
   mind, with all his strength and his neighbor as himself than it would
   be merely to abstain from killing, stealing and false witness. Christ
   has not, therefore, abrogated or at all moderated the Law to meet our
   helplessness. He has left it in all its sublime perfection, as it
   always must be left--and He has pointed out how deep are its
   foundations, how elevated are its heights, how measureless are its
   length and breadth! Like the laws of the Medes and Persians, God's
   commands cannot be altered!

   We are saved by another method. To show that He never meant to abrogate
   the Law, our Lord Jesus has embodied all its Commandments in His own
   life. In His own Person there was a nature which was perfectly
   conformed to the Law of God--and as was His nature, such was His life.
   He could say, "Which of you convicts Me of sin?" And again, "I have
   kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love." I may not say
   that He was scrupulously careful to keep the Law of God--I will not put
   it so, for there was no tendency in Him to do otherwise--He was so
   perfect and pure; so infinitely good and so complete in His agreement
   and communion with the Father, that He, in all things, carried out the
   Father's will.

   The Father said of Him, "This is My beloved Son in whom I am well
   pleased; hear you Him." Point out, if you possibly can, any way in
   which Christ has violated the Law or left it unfulfilled! There was
   never an unclean thought or rebellious desire in His soul. He had
   nothing to regret or to retract--it could not be that He should err. He
   was thrice tempted in the wilderness and the enemy had the
   impertinence, even, to suggest idolatry, but He instantly overthrew the
   adversary. The prince of this world came to Him, but he found nothing
   in Him--

   "My dear Redeemer and my Lord,

   I read my duty in Your Word.

   But in Your life the Law appears

   Drawn out in living characters." Now, if that Law had been too high and
   too hard, Christ would not have exhibited it in His life. But as our
   Exemplar He would have set forth that milder form of Law which is
   supposed by some theologians. He came to introduce. Inasmuch as our
   Leader and Exemplar has exhibited to us in His life a perfect obedience
   to the sacred Commandments in their undi-minished grandeur, I gather
   that He means it to be the model of our conversation.

   Our Lord has not taken off a single point or pinnacle from that
   up-towering alp of perfection. He said at the first, "Lo, I come: in
   the volume of the Book it is written of Me. I delight to do Your will,
   O My God; yes, Your Law is within My heart." And well has He justified
   the writing of the volume of the Book. "God sent forth His Son, made of
   a woman, made under the Law" and, being for our sakes under the Law, He
   obeyed it to the fullest, so that now, "Christ is the end of the Law
   for righteousness to everyone that believes."

   Once more, that the Master did not come to alter the Law of God is
   clear because after having embodied it in His life, He willingly gave
   Himself up to bear its penalty, though He had never broken it, bearing
   the penalty for us, even as it is written, "Christ has redeemed us from
   the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us." "All we like sheep
   have gone

   astray, we have turned, everyone, to his own way, and the Lord has laid
   on Him the iniquity of us all." If the Law had demanded more of us than
   it ought to have done, would the Lord Jesus have rendered to it the
   penalty which resulted from its too severe demands? I am sure He would
   not! But because the Law asked only what it ought to ask--namely
   perfect obedience and exacted of the transgressor only what it ought to
   exact, namely, death, as the penalty for sin--death under Divine wrath,
   therefore the Savior went to the Cross and there bore our sins and
   purged them once and for all.

   He was crushed beneath the load of our guilt and cried, "My soul is
   exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death," and at last, when He had
   borne--

   "All that Incarnate God could bear,

   With strength enough, but none to spare," He bowed His head and said,
   "It is finished." Our Lord Jesus Christ gave a greater vindication to
   the Law of God by dying, because it had been broken, than all the lost
   in Hell can ever give by their miseries, for their suffering is never
   complete, their debt is never paid! But He has borne all that was due
   from His people and the Law is defrauded of nothing. By His death He
   has vindicated the honor of God's moral government and made it just for
   Him to be merciful! When the Lawgiver, Himself, submits to the Law;
   when the Sovereign, Himself, bears the extreme penalty of that
   Law--then is the justice of God set upon such a glorious high throne
   that all admiring worlds must wonder at it! If, therefore, it is
   clearly proven that Jesus was obedient to the Law of God, even to the
   extent of death, He certainly did not come to abolish or abrogate it!
   And if He did not remove it, who can do so? If He declares that He came
   to establish it, who shall overthrow

   it?

   But, secondly, the Law of God must be perpetual from its very nature,
   for does it not strike you, the moment you think of it, that right must
   always be right, truth must always be true, and purity must always be
   pure? Before the Ten Commandments were published at Sinai, there was
   still that same Law of right and wrong laid upon men by the necessity
   of their being God's creatures. Right was always right before a single
   command had been committed to words! When Adam was in the garden it was
   always right that he should love his Maker and it would always have
   been wrong that he should have been at cross-purposes with his God. And
   it does not matter what happens in this world, or what changes take
   place in the universe, it never can be right to lie, or to commit
   adultery, or murder, or steal, or to worship an idol god. I will not
   say that the principles of right and wrong are as absolutely
   self-existent as God, but I do say that I cannot grasp the idea of God,
   Himself, as existing apart from His being always holy and always
   true--so that the very idea of right and wrong seems to me to be
   necessarily permanent and cannot possibly be shifted.

   You cannot bring right down to a lower level! It must be where it
   always is--right is right eternally--and cannot be wrong. You cannot
   lift up wrong and make it somewhat right--it must be wrong while the
   world stands. Heaven and earth may pass away, but not the smallest
   letter or accent of the moral Law can possibly change. In spirit the
   Law is eternal. Suppose for a moment that it were possible to temper
   and tone down the Law of God, where would it be? I confess I do not
   know and cannot imagine! If it is perfectly holy, how can it be altered
   except by being made imperfect? Would you wish for that? Could you
   worship the God of an imperfect Law? Can it ever be true that God, by
   way of favoring us, has put us under an imperfect Law? Would that be a
   blessing or a curse?

   It is said by some that man cannot keep a perfect Law and God does not
   demand that he should. Certain modern theologians have taught this, I
   hope, by inadvertence. Has God issued an imperfect Law? It is the first
   imperfect thing I ever heard of His making! Does it come to this that,
   after all, the Gospel is a proclamation that God is going to be
   satisfied with obedience to a mutilated Law? God forbid! I say, better
   that we perish than that His perfect Law perish! Terrible as it is, it
   lies at the foundation of the peace of the universe and must be honored
   at all hazards. That gone, all goes! When the power of the Holy Spirit
   convinced me of sin, I felt such a solemn awe of the Law of God that I
   remember well, when I lay crashed beneath it as a condemned sinner, I
   yet admired and glorified it. I could not have wished that perfect Law
   to be altered for me.

   Rather did I feel that if my soul were sent to the lowest Hell, yet God
   was to be extolled for His Justice and His Law held in honor for its
   perfectness. I would not have had it altered even to save my soul!
   Brethren, the Law of the Lord must stand, for it is perfect and,
   therefore, has in it no element of decay or change. The Law of God is
   no more than God might most righteously ask of us. If God were about to
   give us a more tolerant Law, it would be an admission, on His part,
   that He asked too much at first. Can that be supposed? Was there, after
   all, some justification for the statement of the wicked and slothful
   servant when he said, "I feared you, because you are an austere man"?
   It cannot be! For God to alter His Law would be an admission that He
   made a mistake! That He put poor imperfect man (we are often hearing
   that said) under too rigorous a regime and, therefore, He is now
   prepared to abate His claims and make them more reasonable.

   It has been said that man's moral inability to keep the perfect Law
   exempts him from the duty of doing so. This is very specious, but it is
   utterly false! Man's inability is not of the kind which removes
   responsibility--it is moral, not physical! Never fall into the error
   that moral inability will be an excuse for sin! What? When a man
   becomes such a liar that he cannot speak the truth--is he, therefore,
   exempted from the duty of truthfulness? If your servant owes you a
   day's labor, is he free from the duty because he has made himself so
   drunk that he cannot serve you? Is a man freed from a debt by the fact
   that he has squandered the money and, therefore, cannot pay it? Is a
   lustful man free to indulge his passions because he cannot understand
   the beauty of chastity? This is dangerous doctrine! The Law is a just
   one and man is bound by it though his sin has rendered him incapable of
   doing so.

   The Law, moreover, demands no more than is good for us. There is not a
   single Commandment of God's Law but what is meant to be a kind of
   danger signal such as we put up upon the ice when it is too thin to
   bear. Each Commandment does, as it were, say to us, "Dangerous!" It is
   never for a man's good to do what God forbids him! It is never for
   man's real and ultimate happiness to leave undone anything that God
   commands him. The wisest directions for spiritual health and for the
   avoidance of evil are those directions which are given us concerning
   right and wrong in the Law of God! Therefore it is not possible that
   there should be any alteration, for it would not be for our good. I
   should like to say to any Brother who thinks that God has put us under
   an altered rule--"Which particular part of the Law is it that God has
   relaxed?" Which precept do you feel free to break?

   Are you delivered from the Commandment which forbids stealing? My dear
   Sir, you may be a capital theologian, but I should lock up my spoons
   when you call at my house! Is it the Commandment about adultery which
   you think is removed? Then I could not recommend your being admitted
   into any decent society! Is the Law as to killing softened down? Then I
   had rather have your room than your company. From which Law is it that
   God has exempted you? That Law of worshipping Him, only? Do you propose
   to have another god? Do you intend to make engraved images? The fact
   is, that when we come to details, we cannot afford to lose a single
   link of this wonderful golden chain which is perfect in every part as
   well as perfect as a whole! The Law is absolutely complete and you can
   neither add to it nor take from it. "Whoever shall keep the whole Law,
   and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do
   not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no
   adultery, yet if you kill, you have become a transgressor of the Law."
   If, then, no part of it can be taken down, it must stand and stand
   forever!

   A third reason I will give why the Law must be perpetual is that to
   suppose it altered is most dangerous. To take away from the Law its
   perpetuity is, first of all, to take away from it its power to convict
   of sin. Is it so, that I, being an imperfect creature, am not expected
   to keep a perfect Law? Then it follows that I do not sin when I break
   the Law! And if all that is required of me is that I am to do according
   to the best of my knowledge and ability, then I have a very convenient
   rule, indeed--and most men will take care to adjust it so as to give
   themselves as much latitude as possible! By removing the Law you have
   done away with sin, for sin is the transgression of the Law! And where
   there is no Law, there is no transgression! When you have done away
   with sin, you may as well have done away with the Savior and with
   salva-tion--for they are by no means necessary!

   When you have reduced sin to a minimum, what need is there of that
   great and glorious salvation which Jesus Christ has come to bring into
   the world? Brothers and Sisters, we must have none of this! It is
   evidently a way of mischief. By lowering the Law, you weaken its power
   in the hands of God as a Convincer of sin. "By the Law is the knowledge
   of sin." It is the looking glass which shows us our spots--and that is
   a most useful thing--though nothing but the Gospel can wash them away--

   "My hopes of Hea ven were firm and bright, But since the precept came

   With a convincing power and light,

   I find how vile I am.

   My guilt appeared but small before,

   Till terribly I saw

   How perfect, holy, just and pure

   Was Your eternal Law.

   Then felt my soul the heavy load, My sins revived again, I had provoked
   a dreadful God, And all my hopes were slain."

   It is only a pure and perfect Law that the Holy Spirit can use in order
   to show us our depravity and sinfulness. Lower the Law and you dim the
   Law of God by which man perceives his guilt! This is a very serious
   loss to the sinner rather than a gain, for it lessens the likelihood of
   his conviction and conversion.

   You have also taken away from the Law its power to shut us up to the
   faith of Christ. What is the Law of God for? For us to keep in order to
   be saved by it? Not at all! It is sent in order to show us that we
   cannot be saved by works and to shut us up to be saved by Grace! But if
   you make out that the Law is altered so that a man can keep it, you
   have left him his old legal hope and he is sure to cling to it! You
   need a perfect Law that shuts man right up to hopelessness apart from
   Jesus--puts him into an iron cage and locks him up--and offers him no
   escape but by faith in Jesus! Then he begins to cry, "Lord, save me by
   Grace, for I perceive that I cannot be saved by my own works."

   This is how Paul describes it to the Galatians--"The Scripture has
   concluded all are under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ
   might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were
   kept under the Law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be
   revealed. Therefore the Law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
   Christ, that we might be justified by faith." I say you have deprived
   the Gospel of its most able auxiliary when you have set aside the Law!
   You have taken away from it the schoolmaster that is to bring men to
   Christ. No, it must stand and stand in all its terrors to drive men
   away from self-righteousness and constrain them to fly to Christ! They
   will never accept Grace till they tremble before a just and holy Law!
   Therefore the Law serves a most necessary and blessed purpose and it
   must not be removed from its place.

   To alter the Law is to leave us without any Law at all. A sliding scale
   of duty is an immoral invention, fatal to the principles of law. If
   each man is to be accepted because he does his best, we are all doing
   our best. Is there anybody that is not? If we take their words for it,
   all our fellow men are doing as well as they can, considering their
   imperfect natures. Even the harlot in the streets has some
   righteousness-- she is not quite so far gone as others. Have you ever
   heard of the bandit who committed many murders, but who felt that he
   had been doing his best because he never killed anybody on a Friday?
   Self-righteousness builds itself a nest, even in the worst character!
   This is the man's talk-- "Really, if you knew me, you would say I have
   been a good fellow to do as well as I have. Consider what a poor,
   fallen creature I am! Consider what strong passions were born in me!
   Consider what temptations to vice beset me and you will not blame me so
   much! After all, I dare say God is as satisfied with me as with many
   who are a great deal better because I had so few advantages."

   Yes, you have shifted the standard and every man will now do that which
   is right in his own eyes and claim to be doing his best! If you shift
   the standard pound weight or the bushel measure, you will certainly
   never get full weight or measurement again! There will be no standard
   to go by and each man will do his best with his own pounds and bushels.
   If the standard is tampered with, you have taken away the foundation
   upon which trade is conducted and it is the same in soul
   matters--abolish the best rule that ever can be, even God's own
   Law--and there is no rule left worthy of the name! What a fine opening
   this leaves for vain-glory! No wonder that men talk of perfect
   sanctification if the Law has been lowered! There is nothing at all
   remarkable in our getting up to the rule if it is conveniently lowered
   for us! I believe I shall be perfectly sanctified when I keep God's Law
   without omission or transgression, but not till then!

   If any man says that he is perfectly sanctified because he has come up
   to a modified law of his own, I am glad to know what he means, for I
   have, no longer, any discussion with him! I see nothing wonderful in
   his attainment. Sin is my need of conformity to the Law of God--and
   until we are perfectly conformed to that Law of God in all its
   spiritual length and breadth--it is idle for us to talk about perfect
   sanctification! No man is perfectly clean till he accepts absolute
   purity as the standard by which he is to be judged. So long as there is
   in us any coming short of the perfect Law, we are not perfect! What a
   humbling Truth of God this is! The Law shall not pass away, but it must
   be fulfilled! This Truth must be maintained, for if it goes, our
   tackling is loose; we cannot well strengthen the mast; the ship goes
   all to pieces; she becomes a total wreck!

   The Gospel itself would be destroyed could you destroy the Law of God!
   To tamper with the Law is to trifle with the Gospel. "Till Heaven and
   earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law,
   till all is fulfilled."

   II. I come to show, secondly, that THE LAW MUST BE FULFILLED. I hope
   there are some in this place who are saying, "We cannot fulfill it."
   That is exactly where I want to bring you! Salvation by the works of
   the Law must be felt to be impossible by every man who would be saved!
   We must learn that salvation is of Grace through faith in Jesus Christ
   our Lord--not by our own doings or feelings. But this is a doctrine no
   one will receive till he has learned the previous Truth of God--that
   salvation by the works of the Law can never come to any man born of
   woman!

   Yet the Law must be fulfilled. Many will say with Nicodemus, "How can
   these things be?" I answer, the Law is fulfilled in Christ and, by
   faith, we receive the fruit thereof. First, as I have already said, the
   Law is fulfilled in the matchless Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. If a man
   has broken a Law, what does the Law do with him? It says, "I must be
   honored. You have broken my command which was sanctioned by the penalty
   of death. Inasmuch as you did not honor me by obedience, but dishonored
   me by transgression, you must die." Our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the
   great Covenant Representative of His people, their second Adam, stood
   forward on the behalf of all who are in Him and presented Himself as a
   victim to Divine Justice.

   Since His people were guilty of death, He, as their Covenant Head, came
   under death in their place! It was a glorious thing that such
   representative death was possible--and it was only so because of the
   original constitution of the race as springing from a common father and
   placed under a single head. Inasmuch as our fall was by one Adam, it
   was possible for us to be raised by another Adam! "As in Adam all died,
   even so in Christ shall all be made alive." It became possible for God,
   upon the principle of representation, to allow substitution. Our first
   fall was not by our personal fault, but through the failure of our
   representative--and now in comes our second and grander
   Representative--the Son of God, and He sets us free, not by our
   honoring the Law, but by His doing so!

   He came under the Law by His birth. And being found as a Man loaded
   with the guilt of all His people, He was visited with its penalty! The
   Law lifts its bloody axe and it smites our glorious Head that we may go
   free! It is the Son of God that keeps the Law by dying, the Just for
   the unjust. "The soul that sins, it shall die"--there is death
   demanded-- and in Christ death is presented! Life for life is rendered!
   An infinitely precious Life instead of the poor lives of men! Jesus has
   died and so the Law has been fulfilled by the endurance of its penalty.
   And being fulfilled, its power to condemn and punish the Believer has
   passed away.

   Secondly, the Law has been fulfilled, again, for us by Christ in His
   life. I have already gone over this, but I want to establish you in it.
   Jesus Christ as our Head and Representative, came into the world for
   the double purpose of bearing the penalty and, at the same time,
   keeping the Law. One of His main designs in coming to earth was "to
   bring in perfect righteousness." "As by the disobedience of one, many
   were made sinners, so by the righteousness of one, shall many be made
   righteous." The Law requires a perfect life and he that believes in
   Jesus Christ presents to the Law a perfect life which he has made his
   own by faith. It is not his own life, but Christ is made of God unto
   us, righteousness, even to us who are one with Him. "Christ is the end
   of the Law for righteousness to everyone that believes."

   That which Jesus did is counted as though we did it! And because He was
   righteous, God sees us in Him and counts us righteous upon the
   principle of substitution and representation. Oh, how blessed it is to
   put on this robe and to wear it! And to stand before the Most High in a
   better righteousness than His Law demanded--for that demanded the
   perfect righteousness of a creature--but we put on the absolute
   righteousness of the Creator Himself! And what can the Law ask more? It
   is written, "In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell
   safely, and this is the name with which He shall be called--THE LORD
   OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." "The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness'
   sake: He will magnify the Law and make it honorable."

   Yes, but that is not all. The Law has to be fulfilled in us personally
   in a spiritual and Gospel sense. "Well," you say, "but how can that
   be?" I reply in the words of our Apostle--"What the Law could not do,
   in that it was weak through the flesh," Christ has done and is doing by
   the Holy Spirit, "that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled
   in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit." Regeneration
   is a work by which the Law is fulfilled, for when a man is born again
   there is placed in him a new nature which loves the Law of God and is
   perfectly conformed to it. The new nature which God implants in every
   Believer at the time he is born again is incapable of sin--it cannot
   sin, for it is born of God! That new nature is the offspring of the
   eternal Father--and the Spirit of God dwells in it, with it and
   strengthens

   it!

   It is light, it is purity, it is, according to the Scripture, the
   "living and incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever." If
   incorruptible, it is sinless, for sin is corruption and corrupts
   everything that it touches. The Apostle Paul, when describing his
   inward conflicts, showed that he himself, his real and best self, did
   keep the Law, for he says, "So then with the mind I, myself, serve the
   Law of God" (Rom. 7:25). He consented to the Law that it was good,
   which showed that he was on the side of the Law. And though sin that
   dwelt in his members led him into transgression, yet his new nature did
   not allow it, but hated and loathed it, and cried out against it as one
   in bondage! The newborn soul delights in the Law of the Lord and there
   is within it a quenchless life which aspires after absolute perfection!
   It will never rest till it pays to God perfect obedience and comes to
   be like God, Himself!

   This which is begun in regeneration is continued and grows till it
   ultimately arrives at absolute perfection. That will be seen in the
   world to come and oh, what a fulfillment of the Law will be there! The
   Law will admit no man to Heaven till he is perfectly conformed to
   it--but every Believer shall be in that perfect condition! Our nature
   shall be refined from all its dross and be as pure gold! It will be our
   delight in Heaven to be holy. There will be nothing about us, then, to
   kick against a single Commandment of God! We shall know, there, in our
   own hearts the Glory and excellency of the Divine will and our will
   shall run in the same channel. We shall not imagine that the precepts
   are rigorous--they will be our own will as truly as they are God's
   will!

   Then nothing which God has commanded, however much of self-denial it
   requires, now, will require any self-denial from us! Holiness will be
   our element, our delight! Our nature will be entirely conformed to the
   Nature and mind of God as to holiness and goodness--and then the Law
   will be fulfilled in us and we shall stand before God, having washed
   our robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb! And, at the
   same time, being ourselves without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing!
   Then shall the Law of the Lord have eternal honor from our immortal
   being. Oh, how we shall rejoice in it! We delight in it after the
   inward man, now, but then we shall delight in it as to our risen bodies
   which shall be charmed to be instruments of righteousness unto God
   forever and ever! No appetite of those risen bodies, no want and no
   necessity of them shall then lead the soul astray, but our whole body,
   soul and spirit shall be perfectly conformed unto the Divine mind!

   Let us long and pant for this! We shall never attain it except by
   believing in Jesus. Perfect holiness will never be reached by the works
   of the Law, for works cannot change the nature. But by faith in Jesus
   and the blessed work of His Holy Spirit, we shall have it and then, I
   believe, it will be among our songs of Glory that Heaven and earth pass
   away, but the Word of God and the Law of God shall stand fast forever
   and ever. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.

Praying and Pleading

   (No. 1661)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do it for Your
   name's sake; for our backslidings are many. We have sinned against You.
   O the Hope of Israel, his Savior in time of trouble, why should You be
   as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turns aside to
   tarry for a night? Why should You be as a man astonished, as a mighty
   man that cannot save? Yet You, O Lord, are in the midst of us, and we
   are called by Your name. Do not leave us!" Jeremiah 14:7,8,9.

   THIS passionate appeal for mercy was forced from the people by extreme
   misery. There was a famine in the land until men fell in the streets of
   the city exhausted with hunger. Drought had long prevailed and lack of
   water was terribly felt. Meanwhile, invasion kept them in perpetual
   fear, so that the Prophet lamented, "If I go forth into the field,
   then, behold, the slain with the sword! And if I enter into the city,
   then, behold, them that are sick with famine!" Such judgment had God
   inflicted on a guilty nation for her sin. No springs were bubbling up
   from the earth and no rain dropped down from Heaven. This dire
   privation had produced universal distress. "Judah mourns, and the gates
   thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of
   Jerusalem is gone up."

   As the calamity, like a river of lava, burned its dreadful way, an
   eyewitness, in his heart's anguish, describes a few common scenes which
   forcefully tell the tale of utter desolation. Princes and peasants are
   seized with the same consternation--the Prophet paints them both with
   their heads covered in token of a common grief. Here in the city the
   children are coming back from the place of pools and fountains with
   empty pitchers, for they find not a drop of water in the pits. Out
   yonder in the fields the ground is chapped and cleft by the scorching
   sun in the absence of dew or rain. The plow is of no use in that
   parched soil! Farmers are sitting down ashamed, confounded, utterly
   dejected--it is vain for them to lift the hand of labor.

   Down in the valleys the dumb cattle express their feeling with throes
   of anguish--the hind calves and forsakes her young. And up on the
   mountain heights the wild asses prove their share in the universal
   distress. Those creatures which are most apt to scent water from afar
   and to hasten to it to drink, are unable to discover a cooling brook,
   though they snuff up the wind like dragons. What a dreadful thing for a
   country to be placed, as it were, at the oven's mouth and to become so
   completely burned up that even the wild beasts can discover no pasture
   and their eyes fail because there is no grass! Nothing could help the
   people. Grim death stared them in the face. None of their idol gods
   could cause rain and, without it, they must all perish.

   Under such circumstances prayer to God was the last and only resource.
   Driven to their wits' end, they now began to be wise. The Prophet has
   expressed in admirable words the penitent confessions and the earnest
   supplications of those who were ready to perish. Our text is a most
   appropriate model of humble petitioning. I can easily imagine that all
   the Jews of the land were willing enough to adopt this form of prayer
   at such an extremity and to follow it with a fervent, "Amen." But, alas
   for them, the feet which had loved to wander were not willing to
   return! And the hearts which had cast off their allegiance to the Lord
   were not reconciled to His Law of righteousness. The Lord felt
   compelled to say of them, "I will destroy My people, since they return
   not from their ways."

   Theirs was prayer in terror, not prayer in penitence! How many there
   are who pray, similar to this, in times of dire distress! When the
   plague was raging, the cross was marked on many a door which otherwise
   had never known that token! When the cholera rages they go to Church.
   When poverty invades their homes and they are sorely pinched, they cry,
   "Lord, have mercy upon us." When they are brought to death's door, they
   entreat, "Send for some minister to come and pray at our side." What a
   wretched business is this, that we should only be disposed to think of
   God when we are in our

   utmost need! Dare we treat the Lord as if He were only to be called
   upon in our emergencies? How can we expect that God will accept prayers
   that are only forced out of us by selfish fears?

   It is not uncharitable to suspect that too often such prayers are
   either hypocritical or superstitious--and far different from the
   contrite cries which are music in the ears of the Most High. What a
   mercy it is that God hears real prayer, even if it is presented to Him
   only because we are in distress! "Call upon Me," says the Lord, "in the
   day of trouble. I will deliver you and you shall glorify Me." When the
   prodigal went home to his father, his father did not say, "You have
   only come home because you have a hungry belly. You seek a meal among
   my hired servants because you could not fill yourself with the husks
   with which the swine are fed." No, not so. Every word was welcome,
   every look was love.

   He "gives liberally, and upbraids not." He does not fling into the
   teeth of a sincere penitent any reproach concerning the past. There is
   no scowl on the heavenly Father's face; no scolding words are uttered
   by His lips. No, but He opens wide His arms of love and clasps His lost
   one to His heart! The Lord of Mercy bids the poor and needy come to Him
   and welcome, though he may have been a rake and a profligate. What a
   dreadful state, then, must those men be in to whose prayers the God of
   all Grace has resolved to shut His ears! Thank God, my dear Hearers,
   that you are still on praying ground and pleading terms with Him. How
   terrible is the case of any who have passed the frontier of hope!

   The case described in this chapter did not admit of pity or pardon. No
   chastisement could condone crimes which had been so repeated and
   gloried in. The Lord Himself bade Jeremiah not to pray for these
   people! If you read the sequel, you will find that God declared that
   though Moses and Samuel stood before Him--though the mightiest of
   intercessors and the best and most honored of saints were to join in
   supplication--yet He would not hear them, for His mind was made up to
   ease Him of His adversaries! Their hour of doom was come! The scaffold
   was ready; the executioner was at hand. Take heed, you that trifle with
   mercy, lest God should put away the silver scepter and draw the sword
   out of its sheath!

   Take heed, you that scorn the Mercy Seat, lest it turn into a burning
   throne of wrath and you "perish from the way while His wrath is kindled
   but a little." That is not the condition of things with us at this
   time, blessed be His name, and so I may invite you to notice the text
   as a model prayer--an excellent example to God's own people who are in
   a wandering state. And afterwards I shall use it as an instructive
   example for sinners, conscious of their sin, who would gladly come to
   God and find mercy.

   I. First, then, I speak to the Church of God at large, wherever it has
   backslidden, and to each Believer in particular WHO MAY HAVE DEPARTED
   FROM THE LIVING GOD IN ANY MEASURE OR DEGREE. Would you take with you
   words and turn unto the Lord? You cannot have better words than those
   now before you! I will read them again. "O Lord, though our iniquities
   testify against us, do it for Your name's sake; for our backslidings
   are many. We have sinned against You. O the Hope of Israel, his Savior
   in time of trouble, why should You be as a stranger in the land, and as
   a wayfaring man that turns aside to tarry for a night? Why should You
   be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet You, O
   Lord, are in the midst of us, and we are called by Your name. Do not
   leave us!"

   Begin by pleading guilty! It is hard to bring men to this, yet there is
   no forgiveness apart from it. "O Lord, though our iniquities testify
   against us, do it for Your name's sake; for our backslidings are many.
   We have sinned against You." The sin-stricken soul has no defense, nor
   even an excuse, to offer on its own behalf. The penitent cries--Guilty!
   Yes, guilty, for there is no denying it. Our iniquities testify against
   us. If there were no witnesses of our sin, our sins, themselves, bear
   witness against us! Oh that every child of God felt this if he has in
   the least gone aside from the paths of holiness!

   It is not only that you see us, O our God, or that our brother
   Christians may have seen our faults, or even that some scoffers in the
   world have spied them out and may be all too ready to bear witness
   against us--but our sins, themselves, have gone before us to the
   Judgment Seat and testify against us! When the facts are in clear
   evidence, what plea can we plead? No witnesses can more effectually
   secure condemnation! Look at the lives of many professors. Yes, let us
   look at our own lives. Is there not enough of fault, enough of folly,
   enough of failure for our own lives, themselves, without any accusation
   from others to witness against us? If I had to stand before God tonight
   to plead upon the matter of my own righteousness, I could do nothing
   but lie in the dust and hide my face for very shame! And it must be,
   more or less, the same with every Believer who knows his own heart and
   life--and sees it in the light of God's Countenance.

   There is no denying the charge--we are prone to wander! Therefore, O my
   Brothers and Sisters, come with me-- take the sinner's place! Be
   abashed as an erring child and come before the great Father and say,
   "Our iniquities testify

   against us." While there is no denying it, let us admit that there is
   no excusing it, "for our backslidings are many." If we could have
   excused ourselves for our first faults by offering a degree of
   extenuation for the fickleness of our youth, yet what are we to say of
   the transgressions of our riper years? If you, my Brethren, could say,
   "Lord, when we began to be Believers we were ignorant and feeble and
   were readily carried away by temptation," you cannot make that apology
   now, when years have given you stability; experience has brought you
   knowledge and the favor and protection of God have ripened your
   character, or should have done so. "Our backslidings are many."

   I feel as if I could not preach about this, for it touches my heart and
   makes me feel ready to weep! Much rather would I like everyone to say
   to himself, "What have I done? What have I left undone? How far have I
   declined from the ways of the Lord?" Turn over the records of your
   life, Brother and Sister Christian! What have you done for Christ? What
   have you done for the Truth of God, for the souls of men, for the
   spread of your Redeemer's Kingdom? Alas, may you not have lived as even
   to have disparaged the Truth and done injury to the cause which is so
   dear to you? "Our backslidings are many." We cannot count them! Their
   number is as great as their guilt!

   It is well for us to feel that extenuation and apology and excuse are
   out of the question. There is no use in our making any pretense to
   self-justification. We are compelled to plead GUILTY! Guilty with gross
   aggravations! Guilty again and again "Our backslidings are many."
   Guilty, though we were under bonds to have lived in a very different
   fashion. Yes, and not only is it past denying and past excusing, but
   also it is past computing! We cannot measure how great have been our
   transgressions, as that next sentence may well imply--"We have sinned
   against You." It looks, at first sight, as if that were the smaller
   sentence of the three. But let me read it again and throw the emphasis
   where it ought to be--and then you will see that it is the heaviest
   clause in the indictment.

   "We have sinned against You." That is where David always lays the
   emphasis upon when he makes his confession-- "Against You, You only,
   have I sinned and done this evil in Your sight." This is the prodigal's
   confession--"Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before You." Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, to have sinned against our Father and His
   infinite love; against our Savior and His precious blood; against the
   Holy Spirit and all His gentle striving and His sweet comforting and
   blessed teachings--this is to have sinned with a vengeance! What shall
   we say of ourselves? Do not such sins strike us dumb? Sins against the
   Law and against the Gospel! Sins against the Light of God and sins
   against knowledge! Sins in our holy things; sins on our knees; sins in
   our hearts--sins--where are they not? Sins as high as the clouds, broad
   as the earth, immense as the sea! Who shall fathom the great ocean of
   our iniquity? It is wise for us, therefore, to stand at the bar of God
   and humbly confess that, "Our iniquities testify against us. Our
   backslidings are many, for we have sinned against You."

   Next to this plea of guilty, we find that the culprits do most
   vehemently appeal to God for mercy. Please observe carefully how they
   order their cause before Him and with what arguments, as Job has it,
   they fill their mouths. No reasons whatever could they fetch from
   themselves. They dare not plead before God that if He will have mercy
   upon them they will do better, for their many backslidings render such
   a promise hopeless. Brothers and Sisters, are you not sick of promising
   that you will, from this time forward, amend your lives? I hardly think
   that we are convinced of our sinfulness if we flatter ourselves that we
   shall do better in the future! Can you again trust that broken bone
   which has let you fall so many times? Can you again trust that tongue
   of yours when already you have been unable to rule it? Can you trust
   that flaming member which has been ready to set on fire the course of
   nature? What? Trust your heart again? Go, confide in the wind or the
   treacherous sea, but trust not your treacherous resolutions!

   "If I could only have my life over again," says one, "I should do
   better." My Brother, I should not like to have my life over again for
   fear I should do worse! And worse I would do unless I had more Grace.
   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, it never does to say to God, "Lord, forgive
   the backslidings of the past, for I shall do better, by-and-by."
   Suppose you do? There is no merit in that! But it is a wild
   supposition, for you will do nothing of the kind. "Yes, but," you say,
   "I am now more resolved than I was. I am older and wiser, now, and I
   feel quite safe because may resolution is so strong." This is fine talk
   for one who is no better than a reed shaken by the wind! How
   preposterous is such boasting! Your strong resolution? How strong is
   the wax before the fire? How strong is the twig in the midst of the
   flame?

   Your resolution, however, seems to yourself to be firm as adamant!
   Alas, it is only seeming! Peter's resolution was strong when he said,
   "Though I should die with You, yet will I not deny You." Yet the look
   and laugh of a silly maid at the palace door opened his mouth with
   floods of blasphemy--that mouth which Peter thought would overflow with

   brave confessions of his Master! We know not what spirit we are of. We
   are worse than we think we are. When young folks tell me how terribly
   wicked they are and, therefore, they are afraid that they cannot be
   saved, I sometimes reply, "Yes, but you are much worse than you think
   you are." They look so astonished, for they hoped to be comforted, and
   ho, they are plunged into a deeper ditch!

   Probably they cry out that they feel themselves to be more weak and
   foolish than any other people alive. I tell them that most likely they
   are near the truth, but that they are much worse than they fancy they
   are, for, in fact, they are utterly undone and there is no good thing
   in them! They look bewildered and then I tell them that the Lord Jesus
   came to save the weak and worthless--and that He looks after the lost
   and ruined ones. We lay the axe to the tree of self that men may fly to
   the Tree of Life! There must be no reliance upon arguments based upon
   our own excellence--we must beg for Grace and plead for mercy--for upon
   no other terms but those of Grace can the Lord meet with us! Child of
   God, it is well for you, in prayer before the Lord, to get rid of every
   sort of excuse, apology, or palliation. Let your self-impeachment stand
   in the forefront of your petition--"O Lord, though our iniquities
   testify against us, do it for Your name's sake; for our backslidings
   are many. We have sinned against You."

   But still there is a plea, for they make a plea out of God's name. From
   the badness of the rebellious subjects to the goodness of the righteous
   Sovereign is a rapid but reasonable transition. A weighty motive is
   suggested that may dispose God to be merciful--and that motive is drawn
   exclusively from Himself--"Though our iniquities testify against us, do
   it for Your name's sake." Oh the majesty of the name of the Lord! The
   fame thereof is wonderful throughout all generations. You have a name,
   O God, for pardoning iniquity. So David said, "For Your name's sake, O
   Lord, pardon my iniquity, for it is great." Come, then, desponding
   Brothers and Sisters! Here is a prayer which will avail for us when the
   night is darkest and not a star is to be seen--"Do it for Your name's
   sake"--because it will glorify Your name to save us! Because there is
   something about Your name which encourages our soul to hope. "Do it for
   Your name's sake."

   The distracted nation is drawn into closer fellowship as the story of
   the past suggests a plea for her present distress. Nor is this all--the
   Covenant of Grace promises a glorious future and this promise is
   pleaded as the Lord is called, "the Hope of Israel." It is well to draw
   upon the bank of hope as well as upon the bank of experience. When your
   cup is full of sorrow and your face is covered with shame--and not a
   ray of light falls on your dreary path--remember that there is a
   history full of Grace behind us and a prophecy full of Glory before us!
   And it is all wrapped up in the name of Him who is the Hope of every
   contrite heart. But take good heed that your hope is not a vague hope.
   See to it that you believe firmly in God and that you lay hold upon an
   actual promise of His Word or some statute of His Kingdom--for then you
   may hope to your heart's content! Though you cannot see the way of
   deliverance, you can feel that the Lord holds you by the hand.

   Now plead with Him, "Lord, You are my only hope. You know that I have
   no hope anywhere else. I am clean driven to despair except You look
   upon me in Your Grace." This is good pleading. Everyone has a hope
   somewhere. To the miserable there remains no other medicine. Deprived
   of this, the sufferer would grow desperate and his melancholy would
   drive him to the verge of madness! But there is a hope of some kind in
   every man's bosom. Now, if you can truly say, "One thing I know, my
   hope is alone in You, my God," you may plead that. You may argue thus--
   "Lord, save me for Your name's sake, that I may never be ashamed of my
   hope. You have never left a poor soul to use You as its anchor and then
   to find that anchor drag and leave the vessel to drift upon a
   lee-shore. Be true, then, to this, Your name, and rescue me and blot
   out my transgressions, seeing I put my trust in You." Beloved, a hope
   so grounded shall never fail you!

   The Church of God pleads the name of God under another title, "The
   Savior in time of trouble." God has saved His people. In the roll of
   fame His name is written as a great Deliverer. The annals of Israel
   were full of anniversaries. By feasts and fasts they were taught to
   remember dire emergencies and delightful escapes. The mighty deeds of
   the Lord of which their fathers had told them are celebrated in Psalms
   and songs--and their charm is this--His mercy endures forever! Here,
   again, is a lesson in the art of prayer. He has been a Savior,
   therefore plead with Him, "Lord, I have no right to salvation, but,
   still, You are a Savior. You have been accustomed to save Your people
   in time of trouble--save me! Fulfill Your gracious office. Lord, save,
   or I perish! It will glorify You to save me. Why is Your name thus
   revealed but to guarantee the Grace that is wrapped up in it? Savior is
   an empty name if You do not save." Is not this fine pleading? O
   Laodicea, you that are neither cold nor hot, do you mourn your
   lukewarmness? Then awake to some such a plea as this--"O Hope of
   Israel, O Savior in time of trouble, for Your name's sake deal
   graciously with me."

   Then, next, she does not mention the name, but it is implied in the
   words. She says, "Why should You be as a stranger in the land?"--one
   who is merely traveling through the country and takes little interest
   in its trouble because he is not a citizen--one who merely puts up for
   a night in an inn and, therefore, does not enter into the cares and
   trials of the family. She does as good as call Him, Master, Lord of the
   house, and His ownership is pleaded in the suit. Jesus, You are Head of
   the family? You are the Lord, the Husband. Will You act as if You were
   a mere lodger or a stranger? Tell Him that your house is His--that the
   Church is His--that He is the Head of it and plead with Him that He
   will not lay aside His position or neglect that condescending
   responsibility which He voluntarily took upon Himself when He became
   the Head of His Church and undertook, on her behalf, to be her
   Redeemer! Plead with Him, then, for His name's sake, and you will win a
   gracious reply!

   Then the argument ventures a little farther and the plea is this, "You,
   O Lord, are in the midst of us, and we are called by Your name." God's
   Presence with His Church and His connection with it becomes a plea.
   Have I not thus pleaded, sometimes, for this Church when I have thought
   over its sins and its wanderings? I have said--"And yet, Lord, You are
   in the midst of us. We have Your Presence at Your Table and in the
   Prayer Meeting. You are with this people right blessedly and we are
   called by Your name. And if You shall leave us, the ungodly world will
   say, 'In that edifice was once assembled a Church of God, but it has
   become deserted! There, in former times, a Gospel ministry flourished,
   but it has failed.' If ever it should be so said, Your name will be
   dishonored."

   See how Israel pleads in the text-- "Why should You be as a man
   astonished?" That is, like a man confounded who does not know what to
   do--who is distracted and amazed! She says, "Lord, if You do not help
   us now, the men of the world will say, 'Their God could not help them.
   They were brought into such a condition, at last, that their faith was
   of no use to them and their God could not deliver them.' Why should You
   be as a mighty man that cannot save? A champion defeated in all his
   efforts? No, but You have given us a banner, a sacred standard that
   must not suffer defeat--let it be displayed because of the Truth of God
   and give us victory."

   Some of you who are trying to serve God have floated into shallow
   waters, lately, and you are in great trouble. Now, if you can somehow
   implicate God in what you are doing, you will greatly strengthen your
   cause. Are you His servant, acting in His name and entangled with
   difficulties that arise out of conscientiously following His command
   and trusting in His promise? Then you may say to Him, "Lord, what will
   the Egyptians say? What will the Philistines say? Will they not say
   that at last it is proved that faith is a delusion, that the promise is
   a snare and that there is either no God, or else that He is a God who
   cannot aid, or will not hear prayer and help His servants?"

   I delight to get upon this track. It refreshes me to feel that I have
   no help but in God, but that His promise binds Him to help me! When I
   am quite out of my own depth, I feel that I must swim, for if the
   Lord's power does not buoy me up, I shall sink to destruction. How can
   He suffer one to be destroyed whose trust is in Him? If this faith is a
   lie, it will be exposed by my failure. And if this God is not the
   living God and He does not hear prayer, the adversaries of the Lord
   will laugh. Ah, then you may plead with Him, "Do it for Your name's
   sake." Though our iniquities have been many-- though we have not served
   You as we ought to do--though we have backslidden often, yet, Lord, do
   not punish Yourself on account of us! Do not put Your name to dishonor
   because of our folly! Do not put Your Gospel to the rout because we are
   so unbelieving! But, for Your own honor's sake, interpose and deliver
   Your servants in this, their time of need!

   II. Having thus tried to put before you, though very feebly, the good
   ground on which your feet may stand while you are wrestling with God, I
   need, for a very few minutes, to speak with THOSE POOR TROUBLED HEARTS
   THAT DO NOT YET KNOW THE LORD or fear that they do not. To my text, as
   a whole, they have no title. But from the matter of it we may draw some
   valuable suggestions for their use. Are there not among us many, who
   though strangers to the fellowship of the saints, are distressed in
   soul and desirous to find peace with God? Are there not many who would
   gladly obtain salvation from the God of Grace? You say, "I need peace."
   Then, I pray you, take heed that you do not put up with a false peace,
   or calm your conscience with anything less than true reconciliation
   with God! It is better to be always restless than to find rest in a
   delusion.

   Begin and continue in the way of the Truth of God, for this will endure
   to the end, while all that is false will burst like a bubble. Begin
   first by confessing your guilt. Come, my dear Hearer, there can be no
   benefit in trying to conceal anything--therefore acknowledge your
   transgression. God can see it all, but there will be great benefit in
   your seeing it

   and confessing it before Him. Do not try to patch up a righteousness of
   your own! Jesus Christ is never sweet to any but to sinners. You have
   to prove that you are a sinner, not a saint--for Jesus gave Himself for
   our sins--not for our merits. Remember, when Christ comes to fill us,
   the first thing we need to know is our own emptiness. Do not,
   therefore, go upon the tack of trying to make any kind of defense!
   Acknowledge your sins and say, "My iniquities testify against me."

   Some of you could not make out a plea of righteousness if you were to
   try--your life-long actions would confuse you if you attempted it. When
   people come in here who have never heard the Gospel, they are often
   brought speedily to receive Christ because when God blesses the Word to
   such, it is not difficult to convince them of sin. They are so plainly
   guilty that they do not dream of disguising it. They never attempt to
   mend their old clothes, for they are too far gone and only fit for the
   dunghill! They would only make greater tears by patching up such old
   and rotten materials.

   Come, oh you poor ragged sinners, in all your torn garments; in all
   your loathsomeness and sin--and say, each one--"Lord, I acknowledge
   that my transgressions testify against me! It is not the first time
   that I have been anxious, or the first time that I have promised better
   things, but I have been a deceiver until now. My backslidings are many.
   I am an old sinner and a hardened sinner. I have sinned against
   convictions, sinned against a tender conscience, sinned against the
   restraints of Your Spirit. If I did seem to leave my evil ways, the dog
   has returned to its vomit and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing
   in the mire."

   Ah, my Hearer, you are a bad fellow, and I want you to admit that you
   are! I want you to stand in the dock like a felon and plead, "Guilty!"
   And be sure you do not add, "Only there are extenuating circumstances."
   There are no such circumstances in your case! You are thoroughly
   unworthy and deserve to be sent to Hell! If you had died in your sins
   20 years ago and had been condemned without mercy, your wickedness
   would have abundantly vindicated the sentence of the Judge! Do you kick
   against that? I hope not--it will be your wisdom to admit your terrible
   desert of punishment. I beseech you, put your confession into words and
   state, truthfully, what you have done! The sense of your wickedness
   will grow more keen when you recall your follies.

   Remember, too, the forms in which you have sinned against God. You have
   violated the Laws which regulate your life. You have set at nothing
   those counsels which make for your physical health and your moral
   welfare. It is bad enough to have sinned against a mother's tears and a
   father's prayers. It is bad enough to have sinned against your own body
   and to have disregarded your wife and your children. That is sad enough
   and horrible enough. Many have gone deep enough in that direction to
   crimson their cheeks with shame! But you have despised the God that
   made you! You have dishonored your Creator. You have lived to gratify
   your own lusts! You have delighted in defying His Laws. "The ox knows
   his owner and the ass his master's crib." And, alas, dumb driven cattle
   have been more dutiful than you!

   The Lord raised you up from fever. He sheltered you in storms. He
   rescued you from shipwreck. He has delivered you many times from going
   down into the Pit by sudden death, yet you have been unmindful of Him
   and unthankful to Him! You have doted on the idols that provoked Him.
   Feel this! Admit this! Mourn this! Come before the Lord in penitent
   contrition! But make sure you are sincere. Think not that the language
   of a litany will avail you if you falsely say, "Lord, have mercy upon
   us miserable sinners," when you are not miserable and do not believe
   that you are sinners at all! Rather may God the Holy Spirit work such
   deep conviction in your spirit that the language of my text may seem
   too feeble for you--may you be compelled to cry out"--O God, no speech
   can tell the depth of my guilt! Forgive me, for Your mercy's

   sake."

   Shall I leave you there sitting down in abject despair? Doubtless in
   such depths we learn that salvation is of the Lord. Be sure of this--no
   excuse can exonerate you! Apologies drawn from your constitution or
   your circumstances will only aggravate your crimes. Your only ground
   for hope must be based on His Grace. Call, now, upon His name! "For
   Your name's sake." You big sinners say, "Lord, if you will save me, it
   will be a great instance of Your power." "Well," said one the other
   day, "it is of no use your trying to convert me. If I ever shall be
   converted, it will need God Himself to do it, for I am such a tough
   fellow." Yes, yes, and the Lord delights to let men see what He can do!
   He proves that He is Omnipotent in the moral world as well as in the
   physical world--and as able to subdue free will as to stay the raging
   of the wild winds that sweep the sea! He is Lord and besides Him there
   is none else! When He speaks, His Word can turn the lion into a lamb,
   the raven into a dove!

   Oh, plead with Him to glorify His power! Say, "Lord, it will show Your
   power if You will save one like me! If You will cast a legion of devils
   out of me, I shall be a standing wonder wherever I go! To men and
   angels I shall be a convinc-

   ing proof of the regenerating power of the Almighty--therefore save me
   for Your name's sake." If the Lord were to forgive a dozen ordinary
   sinners, it would not so much display His mercy among men as in saving
   one unusually vile transgressor. Plead this! There may be somebody
   listening to this discourse whom this word exactly suits. I feel as if
   the Holy Spirit were prompting me to utter these words for your
   use--"Lord, all the sin in the world seems to have run into me as into
   a common cesspool! But, O Lord, if You can cleanse my heart, it will be
   a wonder of mercy, indeed, and Your name shall be glorified! I am the
   man who ought to be damned above all men! I deserve to be the center of
   the target at which all Your arrows ought to be leveled! But oh, if You
   will forgive me, it will make all Hell quiver with astonishment! That
   God should save such an one as I will make Heaven ring with joy that
   such an one should be delivered from going down into the Pit because
   God has found a Ransom."

   Here you may remember that all God's name is comprehended in Jesus
   Christ. This master key unlocks every door! If you will cry, "Lord,
   save me for Jesus' sake, that men may see what Jesus can do by the
   cleansing power of His blood, by the strength of His hands and by the
   love of His heart," you will have pleaded the name of the Lord. This
   argument has matchless force! The dying thief--look what glory He has
   brought to Christ all through the centuries! The Apostle Paul--changed,
   renewed--what honor he has brought to Christ ever since he was saved!
   Be this, then, your prayer, "O Lord, honor Yourself, honor Your Son,
   honor Your Spirit by saving me. Bless me for Your name's sake." Cannot
   you join me in this prayer? O Holy Spirit, enlighten men as to their
   lost condition till they feel that there is no other way of pleading
   and no other name to plead!

   Is it not the desire of the Father that Jesus should see of the travail
   of His soul in the salvation of the chief of sinners? The Lord give you
   a grip of that plea! It is sure to prevail. "For Your name's sake." You
   may thus plead the name of the Father, "My Father, glorify Your
   fatherly heart by welcoming Your prodigal child with a kiss of
   reconciliation and saying, 'Bring forth the best robe and put it on
   him.'" You may next use it with the Holy Spirit and say--"O Divine
   Spirit, glorify Your power over human hearts by cleansing and
   regenerating even me, that men may see Your new creation and wonder at
   it as You do work it in me."

   A great point is to be able to lay hold upon a promise, a promise in
   the Book. I remember, when seeking the Lord, the sweetness of that
   saying to my heart--"Whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall
   be saved." I found liberty when I could plead that! I said, "Lord, as
   far as I know what it means, I do call upon Your name. I have no other
   name to call upon and You have said that whoever calls upon Your name
   shall be saved. Now, for Your Word's sake, do not draw back! I know You
   cannot lie. Fulfill Your promise even to me."

   Brothers and Sisters, we cannot say to a man, when we have made him a
   promise, "I promised to do this for you, but you are such a bad
   fellow." That would be no excuse for our breaking our promise. You must
   honor your promise even if you feel ashamed of the person to whom it
   was made. The Lord in mercy, having made a promise, never quotes our
   character as a reason why He should break it! He knew all about you
   when He made the promise and so He is not surprised. He knows more
   about you, now, than you know about yourself! He knows that you are a
   thousand times worse than you think you are! He has a much deeper sense
   of your guilt than you have! Still, for all that, He is ready to
   pardon! Plead His promise with Him and He will stand to His Word!

   Do any of you doubt the possibility of your obtaining mercy of the Lord
   because of the depths of your iniquity, or the ruinous consequences it
   has already worked? Believe me, you are victims of a delusion of Satan!
   The Lord God is merciful and gracious and passes by iniquity,
   transgression and sin. There are some parts of the book of Jeremiah
   that I should not like to read to you. I can hardly think that they
   were meant to be read in public--they are intended, rather, for our
   private meditations. There is, however, one picture of infamy which I
   will merely hint at, though it has often excited my profound
   astonishment. It runs something like this, "They say if a man puts away
   his wife and she goes from him and is another man's and plays the
   harlot, shall he take her to himself again? Shall not that land be
   greatly polluted? Yet return unto Me, says the Lord."

   Do you see the drift of this striking illustration? Here is a woman,
   kindly treated in every way, who willfully leaves her husband. She has
   not been led astray by a profligate, but she has wantonly left her
   husband of her own wicked self. She has defiled her name and her
   honor--and to crown her infamy, she has even left her paramour and has
   gone on the streets and become utterly vile! Shall her first husband
   take her back, again, after her multiplied and manifest impurities?
   Would it not pollute the land? Everybody will say, "Why, this is an
   offense against morality! She has dishonored herself!

   She has dishonored her husband! She has dishonored her country! "Yet,"
   says God, "return unto Me." Is not this beyond the manner of man? So
   does the mercy of the Lord transcend even the statutes of the Law which
   He gave to Israel!

   You will see the force of this more clearly if you compare the third
   chapter of Jeremiah with the 24th chapter of Deuteronomy. The parable
   is startling! God is represented as dealing with an idolatrous nation
   as it would be an abomination before His own eyes for any man to deal
   with an unchaste wife. Such delight has Jehovah in mercy that He
   dispenses it at the risk of public disgrace! He knew that the
   self-righteous would find fault and that even elder brothers would be
   angry, but He dared all that! Therefore let there be no objection on
   your part! "Yet return again unto Me, says the Lord." If there is any
   disgrace, it must rest on His name whose holiness cannot be sullied!

   The elders in our Savior's day who sat in Moses' seat thought it an
   open scandal that He received publicans and harlots. I am not surprised
   that when He welcomed such fallen ones, they were glad to come--but I
   am astonished beyond measure at those of you who put aside the only
   Gospel that can do you good! Why argue against your own interests
   instead of accepting the Lord's open invitation? Every evangelist who
   preaches pardon and peace by the blood of the Lamb braves the ethics of
   the age--the new teaching is that people must reap the consequences of
   their actions--there is no hope of ever undoing anything that a man
   does and, therefore, there can be no Gospel to the guilty.

   Yes, I know that this is what the reign of Law seems to demand! But,
   for all that, the Lord would sooner that men should accuse Him of
   weakening the principles of morality than refuse a poor sinner who
   comes to Him for mercy in Christ Jesus! I know that if we receive
   certain persons into the Church, the mere moralists cry out, "How can
   they associate with such people?" Yet, come along, come along, you
   chief of sinners! The vilest are welcome to Christ! You that are worse
   than the worst--you who have leaped over the hedge and have got upon
   the wild commons of outrageous sin-- you may come to Jesus!

   Do you sing--

   "Depths of mercy, can there be Mercy still reserved for me"?

   It is reserved for you! You are the person for whom it is reserved!
   This deep consciousness of sin; this guilt of yours which you feel and
   admit points you out as the one to whom I am to say, "Return unto the
   Lord, for He will have mercy upon you! He will blot out your
   transgressions! He will change your nature! He will turn you from a
   sinner to a saint and glorify His name in you! God grant that you may
   each and all prove the exceeding riches of His Grace, for His dear
   name's sake. Amen.

The Indwelling and Outflowing of the Holy Spirit

   (No. 1662)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 28, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He that believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly
   shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spoke He of the Spirit,
   which they that believe on Him should receive: for the Holy Spirit was
   not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified)." John
   7:38,39.

   "Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go
   away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but
   if I depart, I will send Him unto you."

   John 16:7.

   IT is essential, dear Friends, that we should worship the living and
   true God. It will be ill for us if it can be said, "You worship you
   know not what." "You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall
   you serve." The heathens err from this command by multiplying gods and
   making this and that image to be the object of their adoration. Their
   excess runs to gross superstition and idolatry. I fear that sometimes
   we who, "profess and call ourselves Christians," err in exactly the
   opposite direction. Instead of worshipping more than God, I fear we
   worship less than God. This appears when we forget to pay due adoration
   to the Holy Spirit of God. The true God is triune--Father Son, and Holy
   Spirit-- and though there is but one God, yet that one God has
   manifested Himself to us in the trinity of His sacred Persons.

   If, then, I worship the Father and the Son, but forget or neglect to
   adore the Holy Spirit, I worship less than God. While the poor heathen,
   in his ignorance, goes far beyond and transgresses, I must take care
   lest I fall short and fail, also. What a grievous thing it will be if
   we do not pay that loving homage and reverence to the Holy Spirit which
   is so justly His due. May it not be the fact that we enjoy less of His
   power and see less of His working in the world because the Church of
   God has not been sufficiently mindful of Him? It is a blessed thing to
   preach the work of Jesus Christ, but it is an evil thing to omit the
   work of the Holy Spirit--for the work of the Lord Jesus, itself, is no
   blessing to that man who does not know the work of the Holy Spirit!

   There is the ransom price, but it is only through the Spirit that we
   know the redemption! There is the precious blood, but it is as though
   the fountain had never been filled unless the Spirit of God leads us
   with repenting faith to wash therein! The bandage is soft and the
   ointment is effectual, but the wound will never be healed till the Holy
   Spirit shall apply that which the great Physician has provided. Let us
   not, therefore, be found neglectful of the work of the Divine Spirit,
   lest we incur guilt and inflict upon ourselves serious damage. You that
   are Believers have the most forcible reasons to hold the Holy Spirit in
   the highest esteem, for what are you now without Him? What were you and
   what would you still have been if it had not been for His gracious work
   upon you?

   He quickened you, otherwise you had not been in the living family of
   God today. He gave you understanding that you might know the Truth of
   God, otherwise would you have been as ignorant as the carnal world is
   at this hour! It was He that awakened your conscience, convincing you
   of sin! It was He that gave you abhorrence of sin and led you to
   repent--it was He that taught you to believe and made you see that
   glorious Person who is to be believed, even Jesus, the Son of God! The
   Spirit has worked in you your faith, love, hope and every other Grace
   of God! There is not a jewel upon the neck of your soul which He did
   not place there--

   "For every virtue we possess, And every victory won, And every thought
   of holiness, Are His and His alone."

   What have we learned, if we have learned aright, except by the teaching
   of the Holy Spirit? What can we say either in prayer to God or in
   teaching to men that shall be acceptable unless we receive the unction
   of the Holy One of Israel?

   Brothers and Sisters, who is it that has comforted us in our
   distresses; directed us in our perplexities; strengthened us in our
   weaknesses and helped our infirmities in ten thousand ways? Is it not
   the Comforter whom the Father has sent in Jesus' name? Can I speak too
   highly of the riches of His Grace toward us? Can I too much extol the
   love of the Spirit? I know I cannot and you that know what He has
   worked in you delight to hear Him highly spoken of and His work and
   offices set forth! We are bound by a thousand ties to seek His honor
   who has worked in us our salvation! Let us never grieve Him by our
   ingratitude, but let us endeavor to extol Him.

   For my part, it shall be the labor of this morning to impress upon you
   the necessity for His work and the superlative value of it. Beloved
   Brothers and Sisters, notwithstanding all that the Spirit of God has
   already done in us, it is very possible that we have missed a large
   part of the blessing which He is willing to give, for He is able to "do
   exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think." We have already
   come to Jesus and we have drunk of the life-giving stream--our thirst
   is quenched and we are made to live in Him. Is this all? Now that we
   are living in Him and rejoicing to do so, have we come to the end of
   the matter?

   Assuredly not! We have reached as far as that first exhortation of the
   Master, "If any man thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." But do
   you think that the generality of the Church of God have ever advanced
   to the next--"He that believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, out of
   his belly shall flow rivers of living water"? I think I am not going
   beyond the grievous truth if I say that only here and there will you
   find men and women who have believed up to that point. Their thirst is
   quenched, as I have said, and they live--and because Jesus lives they
   shall live also--but health and vigor they have not! They have life,
   but they have not life more abundantly. They have little life with
   which to act upon oth-ers--they have no energy welling up and
   overflowing to go streaming out of them like rivers!

   They have not thought it possible, perhaps, or thinking it possible,
   they have not imagined it possible to themselves. Or believing it
   possible to themselves they have not aspired to it, but they have
   stopped short of the fullest blessing. Their wading in to the sacred
   river has contented them and they know nothing of "waters to swim in."
   Like the Israelites of old, they are slow to possess all the land of
   promise, but rather sit down when the war has hardly begun! Brothers
   and Sisters, let us go in to get of God all that God will give us! Let
   us set our heart upon this, that we mean to have, by God's help, all
   that the infinite goodness of God is ready to bestow! Let us not be
   satisfied with the sip that saves, but let us go on to the Baptism
   which buries the flesh and raises us in the likeness of the risen
   Lord--even that Baptism into the Holy Spirit and into fire which makes
   us spiritual and sets us all on flame with zeal for the Glory of God
   and eagerness for usefulness by which that Glory may be increased among
   the sons of men!

   Thus I introduce you to my texts and by their guidance we will enter
   upon the further consideration of the operations of the Holy Spirit,
   especially of those to which we would aspire.

   I. We will commence with the remark that THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT IS
   INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE WORK OF CHRIST. It is a great pity when
   persons preach the Holy Spirit's work so as to obscure the work of
   Christ. I have known some do that, for they have held up before the
   sinner's eyes the inward experience of Believers, instead of lifting
   up, first and foremost, the crucified Savior to whom we must look and
   live! The Gospel is not, "Behold the Spirit of God," but, "Behold the
   Lamb of God." It is an equal pity when Christ is so preached that the
   Holy Spirit is ignored--as if faith in Jesus prevented the necessity of
   the new birth--and imputed righteousness rendered imparted
   righteousness needless.

   Have I not often reminded you that in the third chapter of John, where
   Jesus taught Nicodemus the doctrine, "Except a man is born again of
   water and of the Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven," we also
   read those blessed words, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: that whoever
   believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so
   loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever
   believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"? The
   necessity for regeneration by the Spirit is put very clearly, there,
   and so is the free promise that those who trust in Jesus shall be
   saved. This is what we ought to do--we must take care to let both these
   Truths of God stand out most distinctly with equal prominence!

   They are intertwined with each other and are necessary each to
   each--what God has joined together let no man put asunder. They are so
   joined together that, first of all, the Holy Spirit was not given until
   Jesus had been glorified. Carefully note our first text--it is a very
   striking one--"This spoke He of the Spirit which they that believe on
   Him should receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet." The word,
   "given," is not in the original--it is inserted by the translators to

   help explain the sense and they were, perhaps, wise in making such an
   addition, but the words are more forcible by themselves.

   How strong the statement, "For the Holy Spirit was not yet." Of course,
   we, none of us, dream that the Holy Spirit was not yet existing, for He
   is eternal and self-existent, being most truly God. But He was not yet
   in fellowship with man to the full extent in which He now is since
   Jesus Christ is glorified. The near and dear communion of God with man
   which is expressed by the indwelling of the Spirit could not take place
   till the redeeming work was done and the Redeemer was exalted! As far
   as men and the fullness of the blessing were concerned, indicated by
   the outflowing rivers of living water, the Spirit of God was not yet.

   "Oh," you say," but was not the Spirit of God in the Church in the
   wilderness and with the saints of God in all former ages?" I answer,
   Certainly, but not in the manner in which the Spirit of God now resides
   in the Church of Jesus Christ. You read of the Prophets and of one and
   another gracious man, that the Spirit of God came upon them, seized
   them, moved them, spoke by them--but He did not dwell in them. His
   operations upon men were a coming and a going--they were carried away
   by the Spirit of God and came under His power--but the Spirit of God
   did not rest upon them or abide in them.

   Occasionally the sacred endowment of the Spirit of God came upon them,
   but they knew not "the communion of the Holy Spirit." As a French
   pastor very sweetly puts it, "He appeared unto men. He did not
   incarnate Himself in man. His action was intermittent--He went and came
   like the dove which Noah sent forth from the ark and which went to and
   fro, finding no rest--while in the new dispensation He dwells, He
   abides in the heart, as the dove, His emblem, which John the Baptist
   saw descending and alighting upon the head of Jesus. Affianced of the
   soul, the Spirit went off to see His betrothed, but was not yet one
   with her. The marriage was not consummated until Pentecost, after the
   glorification of Jesus Christ."

   You know how our Lord puts it, "He dwells with you and shall be in
   you." That indwelling is another thing from being with us. The Holy
   Spirit was with the Apostles in the days when Jesus was with them, but
   He was not in them in the sense in which He filled them at and after
   the Day of Pentecost. The operations of the Spirit of God before our
   Lord's Ascension were not according to the full measure of the Gospel.
   But now the Spirit of God has been poured upon us from on high! Now He
   has descended and now He abides in the midst of the Church. And now we
   enter into Him and are baptized into the Holy Spirit, while He enters
   into us and makes our bodies to be His temples. Jesus said, "I will
   send you another Comforter which shall abide with you forever"--not
   coming and going--but remaining in the midst of the

   Church!

   This shows how intimately the gift of the Holy Spirit is connected with
   our Lord Jesus Christ, inasmuch as in the fullest sense of His
   indwelling, the Holy Spirit could not be with us until Christ had been
   glorified. It has been well observed that our Lord sent out 70
   evangelists to preach the Gospel, even as He had before sent out the
   12--and no doubt they preached with great zeal and produced much
   stir--but the Holy Spirit never took the trouble to preserve one of
   their sermons, or even the notes of one! I have not the slightest doubt
   that they were very crude and incomplete, showing more of human zeal
   than of Divine unction and, therefore, they are forgotten! But no
   sooner had the Holy Spirit fallen, than Peter's first sermon is
   recorded--and from then on we have frequent notes of the utterances of
   Apostles, deacons and evangelists! There was an abiding fullness and an
   overflowing of blessing out of the souls of the saints, after the Lord
   was glorified, which was not existing among men before that time!

   Observe, too, that the Holy Spirit was given after the ascent of our
   Divine Lord into His Glory, partly to make that ascent the more
   renowned. When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive and
   gave gifts to men. These gifts were men, in whom the Holy Spirit dwelt,
   who preached the Gospel unto the nations. The shedding of the Holy
   Spirit upon the assembled disciples on that memorable day was the
   glorification of the risen Christ upon the earth! I know not in what
   way the Father could have made the Glory of Heaven so effectually to
   flow from the heights of the New Jerusalem and to come streaming down
   among the sons of men as by giving that chief of all Gifts, the gift of
   the Holy Spirit when the Lord had risen and gone into His Glory!

   With emphasis, may I say of the Spirit at Pentecost that He glorified
   Christ by descending at such a time. What grander celebration could
   there have been? Heaven rang with Hosannas and earth echoed the joy!
   The descending Spirit is the noblest testimony among men to the Glory
   of the ascended Redeemer! Was not the Spirit of God also sent at that

   time as an evidence of our Divine Master's acceptance? Did not the
   Father thus say to the Church, "My Son has finished the work and has
   fully entered into His Glory. Therefore I give you the Holy Spirit"? If
   you would know what a harvest is to come of the sowing of the bloody
   sweat and of the death wounds, see the first fruits! Behold how the
   Holy Spirit is given, Himself, to be the first fruits, the earnest of
   the Glory which shall yet be revealed in us! I need no better
   attestation from God of the finished work of Jesus than this blazing,
   flaming seal of tongues of fire upon the heads of the disciples! He
   must have done His work, or such a gift as this would not have come
   from it.

   Moreover, if you desire to see how the work of the Spirit comes to us
   in connection with the work of Christ, recollect that it is the
   Spirit's work to bear witness of Jesus Christ. He does not take of a
   thousand different matters and show them to us, but He shall take, "of
   Mine," says Christ, "and He shall show them unto you." The Spirit of
   God is engaged in a service in which the Lord Jesus Christ is the
   beginning and the end. He comes to men that they may come to Jesus.
   Hence He comes to convince us of sin that He may reveal the great
   Sacrifice of sin--He comes to convince us of righteousness that we may
   see the Righteousness of Christ--and of judgment that we may be
   prepared to meet Him when He shall come to judge the quick and dead.

   Do not think that the Spirit of God has come or ever will come among us
   to teach us a new Gospel, or something other than is written in the
   Scriptures. Men come to me with their stories and fancies and tell me
   that they were revealed to them by the Holy Spirit. I abhor their
   blasphemous impertinence and refuse to listen to them for a minute!
   They tell me this and that absurdity--and then father it upon the
   Spirit of Wisdom! It is enough to try our patience to hear their
   foolish ravings, but to find the Holy Spirit charged with them is more
   than we can bear! We have tests and judgments by which to know whether
   they who claim to speak by the Holy Spirit do so or not--for the
   testimony of the Spirit is always most honorable to our Lord Jesus
   Christ--and does not concern itself with the trifles of time and the
   follies of the

   flesh.

   It is by the Gospel of Jesus Christ that the Spirit of God works in the
   hearts of men. "Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of
   God"--the Holy Spirit uses the hearing of the Word of God for the
   conviction, conversion, consolation and sanctification of men. His
   usual and ordinary method of operation is to fasten upon the mind the
   things of God and to put life and force into the consideration of them.
   He revives in men's memories things that have long been forgotten and
   He frequently makes these the means of affecting the heart and
   conscience. The men can hardly remember hearing these Truths of God,
   but still, they were heard by them at some time or other! Saving Truths
   are such matters as are contained in their substance in the Word of God
   and lie within the range of the teaching, or the Person, or work, or
   offices of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is the Spirit's one business here
   below to reveal Christ to us and in us--and to that work He steadily
   adheres.

   Moreover, the Holy Spirit's work is to conform us to the likeness of
   Jesus Christ. He is not working us to this or that human ideal, but He
   is working us into the likeness of Christ that He may be the First-Born
   among many brethren. Jesus Christ is that standard and model to which
   the Spirit of God, by His sanctifying processes, is bringing us till
   Christ is formed in us the hope of Glory. It is for the Glory of Jesus
   that the Spirit of God always works. He works not for the Glory of a
   Church or of a community--He works not for the honor of a man or for
   the distinction of a sect--His one great objective is to glorify
   Christ! "He shall glorify Me," is our Savior's declaration, and when He
   takes of the things of Christ and shows them to us, we are led more and
   more to reverence and love and to adore our blessed Lord Jesus Christ.

   I will not detain you longer with this. You will see how the works of
   Jesus and of the Spirit are joined together indis-solubly, so that we
   may neither set the work of Jesus before the work of the Spirit nor the
   work of the Spirit before the work of Jesus. But we are glad to joy in
   both and to make much of them. As we delight in the Father's love and
   the Grace of our Lord Jesus, so do we equally rejoice in the communion
   of the Holy Spirit and, therefore, these Three agree in One.

   II. We will now advance another step and here we shall need our second
   text. THE OPERATIONS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT ARE OF INCOMPARABLE VALUE. They
   are of such incomparable value that the very best things we can think
   of are not thought to be so precious as these are. Our Lord Himself
   says, "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away,
   the Comforter will not come unto you." Beloved Friends, the Presence of
   Jesus Christ was of inestimable value to His disciples and yet it was
   not such an advantage to His servants as the indwelling of the Holy
   Spirit! Is not this a wonderful statement? Well might our Lord preface
   it by saying, "Now I tell you the truth," as if He felt that they would
   find it a hard saying, for a hard saying it is!

   Consider for a moment what Christ was to His disciples while He was
   here--and then see what must be the value of the Spirit's operations
   when it is expedient that they should lose all that blessing in order
   to receive the Spirit of God! Our Lord Jesus Christ was to them their
   Teacher. They had learned everything from His lips. He was their
   Leader--they had never to ask what to do--they had only to follow in
   His footsteps. He was their Defender--whenever the Pharisees or
   Sadducees assailed them, He was like a brazen wall to them! He was
   their Comforter--in all times of grief they resorted to Him and His
   dear sympathetic heart poured out floods of comfort at once. What if I
   were to say that the Lord Jesus Christ was everything to them, their
   All in All? What a father is to his children, yes, what a mother is to
   her suckling, that was Jesus Christ to His disciples! And yet the
   Spirit of God's abiding in the Church is better, even, than all this!

   Now take another thought. What would you think if Jesus Christ were to
   come among us now, as in the days of His flesh? I mean not as He will
   come, but as He appeared at His first advent. What joy it would give
   you! Oh, the delights, the heavenly joys, to hear that Jesus Christ of
   Nazareth was on earth, again, a Man among men! Should we not clap our
   hands for joy? Our one question would be, "Master, where do You dwell?"
   for we should all long to live just where He lived. We could then
   sympathize with the Negroes when they flocked into Washington in large
   numbers to take up their residence there. Why, do you think, did they
   come to live in that city? Because Massa Abraham Lincoln, who had set
   them free, lived there! And they thought it would be glorious to live
   as near as possible to their great friend!

   If Jesus lived anywhere, it would not matter where! If it were in the
   desert or on the bleakest of mountains, there would be a rush to the
   place! How would the spot be crowded! What rents they would pay for the
   worst of tenements if Jesus was but in the neighborhood! But don't you
   see the difficulty? We could not all get near Him in any literal or
   corporeal fashion. Now that the Church is multiplied into millions of
   Believers, some of the Lord's followers would never be able to see
   Him--and the most could only hope to speak with Him now and then! In
   the days of His flesh the 12 might see Him every day and so might the
   little company of disciples--but the case is altered, now that
   multitudes are trusting in His name.

   If our Lord were at this time living in the United States, we should be
   much grieved to have an ocean between us and our Leader--all the
   companies that could be formed would not be able to run enough boats to
   carry us over. If the Master personally came here to this little
   island, it would not hold all the vast company of the faithful who
   would flock to it. It is much better to have the Holy Spirit, because
   He is dwelling with us and in us! The difficulties of the bodily
   Presence are too great and so, though we would be thankful, like the
   Apostles, if we had known Christ after the flesh, yet we do not marvel
   that they expressed little sorrow when they said that after the flesh
   they knew Him no more. The Comforter had filled the void caused by His
   absence and made them rejoice because the Lord had gone unto His
   Father!

   Are we not apt to think that if our Lord Jesus were here it would give
   unspeakable strength to the Church? Would not the enemy be convinced if
   they saw Him? No, they would not! If they heard not Moses and the
   Prophets, neither would they be converted though one rose from the
   dead! Jesus rose, but they did not, therefore, believe. If our Lord had
   lingered here all this while, His Presence would not have converted
   unbelievers, for nothing can do that but the power of the Holy Spirit!
   "But," you say, "surely it would thrill the Church with enthusiasm.
   Fancy the Lord Himself standing on this platform this morning in the
   same garb as when He was upon earth. Oh, what rapturous worship! What
   burning zeal! What enthusiasm! We should go home in such a state of
   excitement as we never were in before!"

   Yes, it is even so, but then the Lord is not going to carry on His
   Kingdom by the force of mere mental excitement-- not even by such
   enthusiasm as would follow the sight of His Person. The work of the
   Holy Spirit is a truer work, a deeper work, a surer work and will more
   effectually achieve the purposes of God than even would the enthusiasm
   to which we should be stirred by the bodily Presence of our
   well-beloved Savior. The work is to be spiritual and, therefore, the
   visible Presence has departed. It is better that it should be so. We
   must walk by faith and by faith alone! How could we do this if we could
   see the Lord with these mortal eyes? This is the dispensation of the
   unseen Spirit, in which we render Glory to God by trusting in His Word
   and relying upon the unseen energy.

   Now, faith works and faith triumphs though the world sees not the
   foundation upon which faith is built, for the Spirit who works in us
   cannot be discerned by carnal minds. The world sees Him not, neither
   knows Him. Thus, you see that the operations of the Holy Spirit must be
   inestimably precious. There is no calculating their value, since it is
   expedient that we lose the bodily Presence of Christ rather than remain
   without the indwelling of the Spirit of God.

   III. Now go back to my first text, again, and follow me in the third
   head. Those operations of the Spirit of God, of which I am afraid some
   Christians are almost ignorant, are of wondrous power. The text says,
   "He that believes on Me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
   water." THESE OPERATIONS ARE OF MARVELOUS POWER. Brothers and Sisters,
   do you understand my text? Do rivers of living water flow out of you?

   Notice, first, that this is to be an inward work--the rivers of living
   water are to flow out of the midst of the man. The words, are,
   according to our version, "Out of his belly"--that is, from his heart
   and soul. The rivers do not flow out of his mouth--the promised power
   is not oratory. We have had plenty of words, floods of words--but this
   is heart work. The source of the rivers is found in the inner life. It
   is an inward work at its fountainhead. It is not a work of talent and
   ability, show, glitter and glare--it is altogether an inward work. The
   life-flood is to come out of the man's inmost self-- out of the heart
   and essential being of the man. Homage is shown too generally to
   outward form and external observance, though these soon lose their
   interest and power. But when the Spirit of God rests within a man, it
   exercises a home rule within him and he gives great attention to what
   an old divine was known to call, "the home department." Alas, many
   neglect the realm within which is the chief province under our care. O
   my Brothers and Sisters in Christ, if you would be useful, begin with
   yourself! It is out of your very soul that a blessing must come. It
   cannot come out of you if it is not in you! And it cannot be in you
   unless God the Holy Spirit places it there.

   Next, it is life-giving work. Out of the heart of the man, out of the
   center of his life, are to flow rivers of living water. That is to say,
   he is instrumentally to communicate to others the Divine life. When he
   speaks; when he prays; when he acts, he shall so speak and pray and act
   that there shall be going out of him an emanation which is full of the
   life of Grace and godliness. He shall be a light by which others shall
   see! His life shall be the means of kindling life in other men's
   bosoms. "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." Note the
   plenitude of it. The figure would have been a surprising one if it had
   said, "Out of him shall flow a river of living water." But it is not
   so--it says rivers.

   Have you ever stood by the side of a very abundant spring? We have some
   such not far from London. You see the water bubbling up from many
   little mouths. Observe the sand dancing as the water forces its way
   from the bottom and there, just across the road, a mill is turned by
   the stream which has just been created by the spring! And when the
   water-wheel is turned, you see a veritable river flowing forward to
   supply Father Thames. Yet this is only one river! What would you think
   if you saw a spring yielding such supplies that a river flowed from it
   to the north and a river to the south, a river to the east and a river
   to the west? This is the figure before us--rivers of living water
   flowing out of the living man in all directions!

   "Ah," you say, "I have not reached to that." A point is gained when you
   know, confess and deplore your failure. If you say, "I have all things
   and abound," I am afraid you will never reach the fullness of the
   blessing. But if you know something of your failure, the Lord will lead
   you further. It may be that the Spirit of Life which comes forth for
   you is but a trickling brooklet, or even a few tiny drops. Then be sure
   to confess it and you will be on the way to a fuller blessing! What a
   Word of God is this! Rivers of living water!! Oh that all professing
   Christians were such fountains! See how spontaneous it is--"Out of his
   belly shall flow." No pumping is required! Nothing is said about
   machinery and hydraulics! The man does not need exciting and stirring
   up, but, just as he is, influence of the best kind quietly flows out of
   him!

   Did you ever hear a great hubbub in the morning, a great outcry, a
   sounding of trumpets and drums? And did you ever ask, "What is it?" Did
   a voice reply, "The sun is about to rise and he is making this noise
   that all may be aware of it"? No, he shines, but he has nothing to say
   about it! Even so, the genuine Christian just goes about flooding the
   world with blessings and, so far from claiming attention for himself,
   it may be that he is unconscious of what he is effecting! God so
   blesses him that his leaf does not wither and whatever he does is
   prospering, for he is like a tree planted by the rivers of water that
   bring forth its fruit in its season--his verdure and fruit are the
   natural outcome of his vigorous life. Oh, the blessed spontaneity of
   the work of Grace when a man gets into the fullness of it, for then he
   seems to eat and drink and sleep eternal life! And he spreads a savor
   of salvation all round! And this is to be perpetual--not like
   intermittent springs which burst forth and flow in torrents and then
   cease--but it is to be an everyday gushing out!

   In summer and winter, by day and by night, wherever the man is, he
   shall be a blessing. As he breathes, he shall breathe benedictions! As
   he thinks, his mind shall be devising generous things. And when he
   acts, his acts shall be as though the hand of God were working by the
   hand of man! I hope I hear many sighs rising up in the place! I hope I
   hear friends saying, "Oh that I could get to that." I want you to
   attain the fullness of the favor! I pray that we may all get it

   because Jesus Christ is glorified! Therefore the Holy Spirit is given
   in this fashion, given more largely to those in the kingdom of Heaven
   than to all those holy men before the Lord's ascent to His Glory.

   God gives no stinted blessing to celebrate the triumph of His Son! God
   gives not the Spirit by measure unto Him. On such an occasion Heaven's
   grandest liberality was displayed. Christ is glorified in Heaven above
   and God would have Him glorified in the Church below by vouchsafing a
   Baptism of the Holy Spirit to each of us. So I close by this, which I
   hope will be a very comforting and inspiriting reflection.

   IV. THESE OPERATIONS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD ARE EASILY TO BE OBTAINED BY
   THE LORD'S CHILDREN. Did you say you had not received them? They are to
   be had! They are to be had at once! First, they are to be had by
   believing in Jesus. "This spoke He of the Spirit, which they that
   believe on Him should receive." Do you not see that it is faith which
   gives us the first drink and causes us to live? And this second, more
   abundant blessing of being, ourselves, made fountains from which rivers
   flow, comes in the same way! Believe in Christ, for the blessing is to
   be obtained not by the works of the Law, nor by so much fasting,
   striving, or effort--but by belief in the Lord Jesus!

   With Him is the residue of the Spirit. He is prepared to give this to
   you, yes, to every one of you who believe on His name. He will not, of
   course, make all of you preachers--for who, then, would be hearers? If
   all were preachers, the other works of the Church would be neglected.
   But He will give you this favor--that out of you there shall stream a
   Divine influence all round you to bless your children, to bless your
   servants, to bless the workmen in the house where you are employed and
   to bless the street you live! In proportion as God gives you
   opportunity, these rivers of living water will flow in this channel and
   in that--and they will be pouring forth from you at all times--if you
   believe in Jesus for the full blessing and can, by faith, receive it.

   But there is another thing to be done as well, and that is to pray. And
   here I want to remind you of those blessed Words of the Master,
   "Everyone that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that
   knocks it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that
   is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask for a fish, will
   he, for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask for an egg, will
   he offer him a scorpion? If you, then, being evil, know how to give
   good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father
   give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?" You see, there is a
   distinct promise to the children of God that their heavenly Father will
   give them the Holy Spirit if they ask for His power--and that promise
   is made to be exceedingly strong by the instances joined to it. If
   there is a promise that God can break (which there is not), this is not
   the promise, for God has put it in the most forcible and binding way.

   I know not how to show you its wonderful force! Did you ever hear of a
   man who, when his child asked for bread, gave him a stone? Go to the
   worst part of London and will you find a man of that kind? You shall,
   if you like, get among pirates and murderers, and when a little child
   cries, "Father, give me a bit of bread and meat," does the most wicked
   father fill his own little one's mouth with stones? Yet the Lord seems
   to say that this is what He would be doing if He were to deny us the
   Holy Spirit when we ask Him for His necessary working--He would be like
   one that gave his children stones instead of bread! Do you think the
   Lord will ever bring Himself down to that? He says, "How much more
   shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"

   He makes it a stronger case than that of an ordinary parent! The Lord
   must give us the Spirit when we ask Him, for He has, herein, bound
   Himself by no ordinary pledge. He has used a simile which would bring
   dishonor on His name and that of the very grossest kind, if He did not
   give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him! Oh, then, let us ask Him at
   once with all our hearts! Am I not so happy as to have in this audience
   some who will immediately ask? I pray that some who have never received
   the Holy Spirit at all may now be led, while I am speaking, to pray,
   "Blessed Spirit, visit me! Lead me to Jesus." But especially those of
   you that are the children of God--to you is this promise especially
   made! Ask God to make you all that the Spirit of God can make you--not
   only a satisfied Believer who has drunk for himself--but a useful
   Believer who overflows the neighborhood with blessing!

   I see here a number of friends from the country who have come to spend
   their holiday in London. What a blessing it would be if they went back
   to their respective Churches overflowing! There are numbers of Churches
   that need flooding! They are dry as a barn floor and little dew falls
   on them. Oh that they might be flooded! What a wonderful thing a flood
   is! Go down to the river; look over the bridge and see the barges and
   other crafts lying in the mud. All the king's horses and all the king's
   men cannot tug them out to sea! There they lie, dead and motionless as
   the mud, itself! What shall we do with them? What machinery can move
   them? Have we a great engineer among us who will devise a scheme for
   lifting

   these vessels and bearing them down to the river's mouth? No, it cannot
   be done! Wait till the tide comes in! What a change! Each vessel walks
   the water like a thing of life! What a difference between the low tide
   and the high tide! You cannot stir the boats when the water is gone,
   but when the tide is at the full, see how readily they move--a little
   child may push them with his hand!

   Oh, for a flood of Divine Grace! May the Lord send to all our Churches
   a great springtide! Then the indolent will be active enough and those
   who were half dead will be full of energy. I know that in this
   particular dock several vessels are lying that I should like to float,
   but I cannot stir them. They neither work for God nor come out to the
   Prayer Meetings! They do not give of their substance to spread the
   Gospel. If the flood would come, you would see what they are capable
   of--they would be active, fervent, generous, abounding in every good
   word and work! So may it be! So may it be! May springs begin to flow in
   all our Churches and may all of you who hear me this day get your share
   of the streams!

   Oh that the Lord may now fill you and then send you home bearing a
   flood of Grace with you! It sounds odd to speak of a man's carrying
   home a flood within him and yet I hope it will be so--and that out of
   you shall flow rivers of living water! So may God grant it for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

The True Gospel Is No Hidden Gospel

   (No. 1663)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 4, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But if our Gospelis hid, itis hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest
   the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,
   should shine on them." 2 Corinthians 4:3,4.

   I THINK in this case the Revised New Testament gives a better
   translation than does the Authorized Version and I will, therefore,
   read it, "But even if our Gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that
   are perishing, in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of
   the unbelieving, that the light of the Gospel of the Glory of Christ,
   who is the image of God, should not dawn upon them." Paul had been
   speaking of Moses with the veil over his face and we lose the track of
   his thought if we use the word, "hid," instead of, "veiled." Our Gospel
   wears no veil, but exhibits all the Glory of its countenance to the
   sons of men. Oh that they may be able to steadfastly behold it and see
   in it their own salvation and the Glory of the Lord!

   Observe at the outset the confidence with which Paul speaks. It is
   abundantly evident that he has no doubt whatever that the Gospel which
   he proclaims is assuredly true. No, that it is so manifestly true that
   if those who have heard it do not accept it, it must be because the god
   of this world has blinded their minds! The accent of conviction makes
   every word emphatic. He believes and is sure! And he is convinced that
   those who do not believe must be under the thralldom of the devil. This
   is not the ordinary style in which the Gospel is preached nowadays! We
   hear men courteously apologize for stating anything as absolute, for
   they are fearful of being thought narrow-minded and bigoted! We hear
   them prove what is clear as noonday and back up with arguments what
   God, Himself, has said--as if the sun needed candles to exhibit it, or
   as if God's Word needed the support of human reasoning!

   The Apostle did not take the defensive ground at all! He carried the
   war across the border and assailed the unbelievers. He came forth fresh
   from God with a Revelation and his every word seemed to challenge men
   with--"This is God's Word. Believe it, for if you do not, you will
   incur sin and prove that you are lost and are under the influence of
   the devil." When the Gospel was preached in that royal style, it
   prevailed mightily and annihilated opposition! Cavilers came, of
   course. "What will this babbler say?" was a common question, but the
   heralds of the Cross made short work of all cavilers, for they simply
   went on declaring the glorious Gospel! Their one word was, "This is
   from God! If you believe it, you shall be saved. If you reject it you
   shall be damned."

   They made no bones about it, but spoke like men who believed in their
   message and judged that it left unbelievers without excuse. They never
   altered their doctrine or softened the penalty of refusing it. Like
   fire among stubble, the Gospel consumed all before it when it was
   preached as God's Revelation. It does not spread, today, with equal
   rapidity because many of its teachers have adopted what they fancy are
   wiser methods--they have become less certain and more indifferent and,
   therefore, they reason and argue where they should proclaim and assert!
   Some preachers rake up all the nonsense that any scientific or
   unscientific man likes to bring forward and spend half their time in
   trying to answer it! What can be the use of untying the knots which are
   tied by skeptics? They only tie more! It is not for my servant to
   dispute my message, but to deliver it correctly, as mine, and there
   leave it.

   If we get back, again, to the old platform, and speak as from God, we
   shall not speak in vain, for He will surely honor His own Word. The
   preacher should either speak in God's name or hold his tongue. My
   Brother, if the Lord has not sent you with a message, go to bed, or to
   school, or mind your farm--for what does it matter what you have to say
   on your own? If Heaven has given you a message, speak it out as he
   ought to speak who is called to be the mouth for God! If we are to make
   up our Gospel as we go along, out of our own heads, and compound our
   own theology as chemists make up mixtures of drugs, we have an endless
   task before us and failure stares us in the face! Alas for the weakness
   of human wit and the fallacy of mortal reasoning!

   But if we have to deliver what God declares, we have a simple task and
   one which must lead to grand results, for the Lord has said, "My Word
   shall not return unto Me void." Where did the Apostle learn to speak
   thus positively? He tells us in the first verse of the chapter,
   "Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we
   faint not." He had, himself, been once a persecutor and he had been
   convinced of his error by the appearance of the Lord Jesus to him. This
   was a great deed of mercy. He now knew that his sins were forgiven. He
   felt in his own heart that he was a regenerated man, changed, cleansed,
   newly created and this was, to him, overwhelming evidence that the
   Gospel was from God. To himself, at any rate, the Gospel was a Truth of
   God past argument, needing no other demonstration than its marvelous
   effect upon himself!

   Having received mercy for himself, he judged that other men were in
   need of mercy even as he was, and that the same Gospel which had
   brought light and comfort to his own soul would bring salvation to
   them, also. This braced him to his work. By this consciousness he was
   made to speak as one having authority. There was no hesitancy about
   him, for he spoke what he felt. Ah, Friends, we not only deliver a
   message which we believe to be from God, but we tell out that which we
   have tested and tried within our own souls! An unconverted preacher
   must be in a sorry plight, for he lacks evidence of the Truth of God
   which he proclaims. A man who is not familiar with the effect of the
   Gospel upon his own heart must endure much disquietude when he stands
   up to preach upon it. What does he really know about it if he has never
   felt its power?

   But if he has been converted by its means, then he is confident and is
   not to be moved by the questions and quibbles of those who oppose him.
   His inner consciousness strengthens him in the delivery of his message.
   We must also feel the influence of the Word of God that we may speak
   what we know and testify what we have seen. Having received mercy we
   cannot but speak of that mercy positively as of a thing which we have
   tested and handled--and knowing that it is God who has given us the
   mercy, we cannot but speak with anxious desire that others may partake
   of Divine Grace.

   We now come to consider our text. Our first observation shall be the
   Gospel is, in itself, a glorious light, for in the fourth verse Paul
   speaks of the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ. Secondly, this
   Gospel is, in itself, plain and simple. Thirdly, if we preach it as we
   ought to preach it, we keep it plain and do not muddle it up by worldly
   wisdom. And fourthly, it being in itself a great light and in itself,
   clear, therefore the preaching being clear, if men do not see it, it is
   because they are lost--it is a fatal sign when men are unable to
   perceive the light of the Gospel of the Glory of Jesus Christ.

   I. First, then, THE GOSPEL IS IN ITSELF A GLORIOUS LIGHT. In countless
   places it is so described in the New Testament. This is the light which
   has come into the world. "The darkness is past, and the true light now
   shines." Observe that this light reveals the Glory of Christ. This is
   the new translation and it is a valuable one-- "The light of the Gospel
   of the Glory of Christ." You know the Hebrews had a different mode of
   expression from the Greek and if we are to read the Greek as though
   Paul Hebraized it, then we read it according to the version we have
   here-- "the glorious Gospel of Christ." But if we read the Greek as
   Greek, then it runs, "the light of the Gospel of the Glory of Christ."
   The renderings are equally true, but the second one has a fullness and
   freshness of sense about it worthy of special note.

   The Gospel reveals the Glory of Christ. It tells us that He is the
   eternal Son of the Father, by whom all things were made, for whom all
   things were created and by whom they continue to exist. This might not
   have been good news to us if it had stood alone, though it ought always
   to be good for the creature to be informed of his Creator. But the
   Gospel further reveals to us that this ever-blessed Son of the Highest
   came down to earth in infinite pity, espoused our nature, was born at
   Bethlehem and became as truly Man as He was assuredly God. This was the
   first note of the Gospel and there was so much delight in it that it
   set all the angels in Heaven singing--and the shepherds who kept watch
   over their flocks by night heard the chorales of the first Christmas
   rung out from the midnight sky--"Glory to God in the highest, and on
   earth peace, good will toward men."

   It could not but mean peace to man that God should become Man! It could
   not but mean mercy to the guilty that the Heir of Glory should be born
   into their race! It must be good news to us that the offended One
   should take upon Himself the nature of the offender! So the first pure
   Gospel music rang out that made glad the ear of mankind! The Lord God
   Omnipotent became Immanuel--God With Us! "Unto us a Child is born, unto
   us a Son is given, and His name shall be called Wonderful." This is the
   beginning of the Gospel of the Glory of Christ--He gained a greater
   Glory by laying aside His Divine Glory!

   Furthermore, the Gospel tells us that this same mighty God, the
   Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace dwelt here among men, preaching
   and teaching, and working miracles of matchless mercy, everywhere
   proving Himself to be man's brother, sympathetic and tender and gentle,
   receiving to Himself even the lowest of the people and bowing Himself
   to the least of the race. It is written, "Then drew near unto Him the
   publicans and sinners for to hear Him." And again He took little
   children into His arms and blessed them, and said, "Suffer the little
   children to come unto Me, and forbid them not." There was a Gospel
   about all that He did and a Glory which men who are pure in heart both
   see and admire!

   His life was good news--it was a new and a glad thing that God should
   dwell among men and be found in fashion as a Man. The God that hates
   sin and whose wrath burns against iniquity, tabernacled among sinners
   and saw and felt their evil ways and prayed for them, "Father, forgive
   them." His Glory lay in His being so patient, gentle and
   self-sacrificing, and yet so just and true. Well did John say, "The
   Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His Glory, the
   Glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father), full of Grace and truth."
   But the Gospel's biggest bell, which rings out with clearest note, is
   that this Son of God, in due time, gave Himself for our sins, making an
   offering of His whole Human Nature as a propitiation for the guilt of
   men! Herein is an excessive Glory of love!

   What a sight it was to see Him in the garden oppressed with our load of
   guilt till the bloody sweat was forced from Him! To see Him bearing
   that stupendous weight up to the Cross and there hanging in agonies of
   death, bearing the desertion of His Father and all the thick clouds of
   darkness that came of it--dying--the "Just for the unjust to bring us
   to God"! It was the Glory of Christ that He was there bereft of all
   Glory! Never can a more glorious thing be said of Him than that He, for
   our sakes, was obedient to death, even the death of the Cross! And this
   is the Gospel we preach, the Gospel of Substitution, that Jesus stood
   in the sinner's place and bore in the sinner's stead what was due to
   the Law of God on account of man's transgression.

   Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord reigns from the Cross--

   "Fling out the banner! Let it float Skyward and seaward, high and wide!
   Our Glory only in the Cross, Our only hope, the Crucified."

   No more gladsome news could come to man than that the Incarnate God had
   borne man's s sins and died in man's place! Yet there is another note,
   for He that died and was buried is risen from the dead and has borne
   our nature up into Glory--and there He wears it at the Father's right
   hand. His loving heart is still occupied with the same Divine errand
   that brought Him down below--He is, by His intercession, saving sinners
   whom He purchased with His blood! He is able to save them to the
   uttermost who come unto God by Him, seeing He always lives to make
   intercession for them!

   This is the Gospel of the Glory of Christ! It is our Lord's Glory that
   He mediates between man and God, pleading for the unjust ones, using as
   His all-prevailing argument the blood which He has shed. But I must not
   leave out the fact that He who now in Glory pleads for sinners will
   speedily come, again, to gather all His own unto Himself, to shed
   abroad on them the fullness of His own Glory and to take them up to be
   with Him where He is. There is wondrous light in the Gospel, both for
   the future and the present! It sets forth to us the Glory of Christ,
   the Glory of love, the Glory of mercy, the Glory of a blood which can
   wash the blackest, white! The Glory of a plea which can make the
   poorest prayer, acceptable! The Glory of a living and triumphant
   Savior, who, having put His hands to the work, will not fail nor be
   discouraged till all the purposes of infinite love shall be achieved by
   Him. This is "the Gospel of the Glory of Christ" and the light of it is
   exceedingly clear and bright!

   We are now called to a second Truth of God--the Gospel is a light which
   reveals God, Himself, for, according to our text, the Lord Jesus is the
   image of God. Did not Jesus say, "He that has seen Me has seen the
   Father"? For, first, our Lord Jesus is the image of God in this sense,
   that He is essentially One with God. He is "the brightness of the
   Father's Glory and the express image of His Person." He is "very God of
   very God," as the creed has it, and I know not how better to express
   the idea. Our Lord Himself said, "I and My Father are One." But the
   text means more than that. Christ is the image of God in this sense,
   that He shows us what God is. If you know the Character of Jesus, you
   know the Character of God.

   God Himself is invisible and is not seen of mortal eyes; neither can He
   be comprehended of finite mind. He cannot, indeed, be truly known at
   all except by the teaching of the Holy Spirit. But all that can be
   known of God is fairly written in capital letters in the Person of
   Jesus. What higher conception of God can you have? Even those who have
   denied our

   Lord's Deity have yet been subdued into admiration by His matchless
   Character. Read His life through and see if you could improve it. Can
   you suggest anything that should be left out, or anything that could be
   added? He is God and in Him we see God as far as it is possible for us
   to discern that matchless Father of our spirits! Thus the Gospel is
   full of light, revealing, first, the Mediator and then the Lord God,
   Himself.

   Now, dear Friends, this Gospel of the Glory of Christ is really light
   to us, that is to say, it brings with it all that the metaphor of light
   sets forth. First of all it brings illumination. It is a lighting up of
   the soul "to know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You
   have sent." It is light to the understanding to be able to see that the
   Only-Begotten has revealed the Father. Man feels after God as if, by
   chance, he may find Him and the heathen stumbles upon this and that in
   his blind groping. Perhaps the world was nearest the truth when it
   called Him, "the unknown God." When the wisdom of this world once began
   to define and to describe the Deity--then it proved its own folly. "The
   world by wisdom knew not God," but in the Person of the Lord Jesus we
   have the true icon, the image and representation of the Godhead.

   It cannot be said of true Christians, "You worship you know not what,"
   for we know what we worship! Each one of us can affirm, "I know whom I
   have believed." We have no question about who is our God, or what He
   is. There is a knowledge given by the Gospel to men which creates
   daylight in the understanding. But it is light in another sense,
   namely, that of comfort. Let a man see God in Jesus Christ and he
   cannot be unhappy. Is it sin that burdened him? Let him see Jesus
   Christ bearing sin in His own body on the Cross and let him believe in
   this same Sin-Bearer--and that burden is gone! Let him be fretting
   under the cares and trials of life and let him get a view, by faith, of
   Jesus--an infinitely greater Sufferer--sympathizing with him in his
   sorrow and surely the sting of his grief is removed!

   Is he afraid to die? Let him hear Jesus say, "I am the Resurrection and
   the Life," and he shall be taught to long for death rather than to
   dread it! Is he troubled about the things to come? Does the awful
   future hover darkly before him? Let him only hear Jesus say, "I am He
   that lives and was dead, and am alive forevermore, amen, and hold the
   keys of Hell and death," and he will no longer be afraid of the
   separate world of spirits of which Christ has the key nor will he
   tremble at the burning of the world and the ruin of creation--for he
   has a hold upon One who has said--"Because I live, you shall live,
   also." Never did such another light ever shine upon the sons of men!
   Neither for instruction nor for comfort can this eternal Truth of God
   be rivaled!

   It were not in the power of an archangel to tell you the joy which this
   "Gospel of the Glory of Christ" has given to the sons and daughters of
   affliction! Wherever it comes, it liberates the captive mind and
   removes the pains of remorse. At the very sight of it, tearful eyes are
   brightened till they flash with delight! Oh, the joy unspeakable of
   having Christ to be our Savior and the glorious God to be our Father!
   He is rich to all the intents of bliss who knows this. This is light
   and all else is darkness!

   We now advance a step, and observe that--II. THIS GOSPEL IS, IN ITSELF,
   MOST PLAIN AND CLEAR. The

   Gospel contains nothing which can perplex anybody unless he wishes to
   be perplexed. There is nothing in the Gospel which a man may not
   apprehend if he desires to apprehend it. It is all plain to the man who
   yields his understanding to his God. Whenever I get a book which
   puzzles me, very much, to make out its meaning, I wish I could send it
   back to the author and tell him to write it over, again, because I am
   sure he is not very clear about his own meaning--or else he could
   easily make me know what he meant. A man has never fairly mastered a
   subject until he is able to communicate his thoughts on that subject so
   that persons of ordinary intelligence can tell what he means.

   Now, the Lord has, in His own mind, a clearly-defined way of salvation
   for men and He has expressed Himself without ambiguity. Certain divines
   like to preach an incomprehensible Gospel, for it gives them the air of
   wisdom in the judgment of the foolish. Certain hearers prefer sermons
   which they cannot understand. To them the difficult and intricate are
   as marrow and fatness. I heard of one who said he liked a bit of
   gristle in the sermons, or a bone to try his teeth upon. We could
   easily gratify such friends, but we see no authority in Scripture for
   gratifying this longing. I carefully endeavor to take the stones out of
   the fruit before preparing the dish. When we are eating, it is by no
   means a good thing to swallow the bones, for our digestion might not
   master them and we might be injured by their presence within.

   Souls want spiritual nutriment, not problems and riddles. So, when a
   man preaches the Gospel so that you cannot make heads or tails of it,
   you need not fret, for what he has to say is not worth your trouble in
   listening to it! If it is the Lord's own Gospel, you who are doers of
   the Lord's will can understand it. And if you cannot, it is not the
   Gospel of the Glory of Christ, but a gospel of human inventing! The
   true Gospel is simplicity itself. Listen! That God should come

   among men and espouse our Nature is so far a great mystery that we do
   not know how it could be! Blessed be God, we do not need to know how it
   was done--we only know that it was done and that fact is enough for us.
   We understand that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we
   rejoice therein. Observe the doctrine of the Atonement--this, also, as
   a fact is plain enough! How it became right for Christ to suffer in our
   place and for His sufferings to be an expiation for our sins may be a
   very deep question, but the fact is clearly revealed.

   I do not think Substitution to be a bewildering mystery, but some do.
   What if it is? The secret reason of it is nothing to us! If God has set
   forth Christ to be a Propitiation for our sins, our most reasonable
   course is to accept Him. We need not quarrel with Grace because we
   cannot understand everything about it. It is wiser to eat that which is
   set before us than to die of hunger because we do not know all the
   secrets of cooking! I am not asked to understand how God justifies us
   in Christ, but I am asked to believe that He does! The fact is plain
   enough and the fact is the objective offaith. That Jesus should suffer
   in my place is a simple matter of the Truth of God and in it there is
   no darkness at all. That precious doctrine that we are justified by
   faith--that all the merit of Christ's glorious work comes to us simply
   by our believing-- is there any difficulty about that? I know that men
   may argue till they are blue in the face, but the doctrine is plain as
   a pikestaff!

   At times persons enquire, "What is believing?" Well, it is trusting,
   depending, leaning upon, relying upon--that is all. Is there anything
   hard about that? Do you want to put on your spectacles to see through
   it? Will it require a week to work your way into the idea? No, the fact
   that God was made flesh and dwelt among us, and that being found in
   fashion as a Man, He became obedient to death for our sakes and that He
   now bids us simply trust Him and we shall live, is as simple as any
   Truth within the sphere of knowledge! Some people would like a gospel
   of puzzlement--they prefer a little confusion of the intellect--they
   love to wander in a luminous haze in which nothing is clearly defined.
   They feel that they are getting on when they are leaving others behind
   and rising into sublime absurdity!

   Now, suppose the Gospel consisted in terrible mysteries, bristling with
   matters hard to be understood? Suppose it required 18 volumes to be
   read through before you could see it? Suppose it needed mathematical
   precision and classical elegance before you could see it--millions
   would never get to Heaven, for they have never read through a single
   volume and, therefore, they are not likely to digest a library! Some
   men are so busy and some have their brains so constituted that they
   never will be deep students--and if the Gospel required of them deep
   thought and long research--they might give themselves up for lost. If
   men needed to be philosophers in order to be Christians, the majority
   of men would be out of the pale of hope! If the masses of the people
   must read hard before they can catch the idea of salvation by faith in
   Christ Jesus, they will never catch the idea--they must inevitably
   perish.

   And would you, learned men, like them to perish? I fear that some of
   you have less concern about that than about your own credit for talent
   and thought! For the sake of getting a profound little gospel all to
   yourselves, you would dig a moat around the Cross of Christ to keep the
   vulgar crowd from intruding! That is not the Gospel, nor the spirit of
   the Lord Jesus! Take care lest you miss the Truth of God yourselves! I
   fear that while you are fumbling for the latch of Heaven's gate, the
   people whom you despise will get inside the door and be singing,
   "Glory, hallelujah, we have found the Savior." The Lord permits the
   disputer of this world to stumble, while those who receive the Kingdom
   of God as little children, find out the great secret and rejoice in it!

   Suppose the Gospel had been such a difficult thing to explain and such
   a very hard matter to understand--what would become of the many who are
   now rejoicing in Christ and yet have, by birth and constitution, the
   most shallow capacities? It is wonderful how one but little raised
   above an idiot can yet grasp the Gospel! What a blessing that it is so!
   I have heard of a poor boy whom his teachers had been instructing for
   years and, one day, they said to him, "Well, Jack, have you a soul?"
   "No, I've got no soul." They feared that they had lost their labor, but
   their minds were changed when he added, "I had a soul, once, and I lost
   it. And Jesus Christ came and found it and so I let Him keep it." That
   was better Gospel than we get from many a learned divine! He had the
   whole thing at his fingertips! Christ had found his soul and was
   keeping it for him--even He who will not fail to keep that which we
   have committed to His charge.

   We clap our hands for joy because the Gospel reveals the plain man's
   pathway to Heaven and makes the most illiterate wise unto salvation!
   The shepherd on Salisbury Plain can understand the Gospel as well as
   the Bishop in Salisbury Cathedral! And the dairyman's daughter can feel
   its power as fully as a Princess! Suppose the Gospel were hard to be
   understood, what should we do at our deathbed? We are sent to see
   persons who have neglected attendance upon the means

   of Grace and are dying in ignorance. It is our sorrowful task to
   explain the path of life to them when they are entering upon the dark
   descent of death.

   While the lamp continues to burn, we have hope and, therefore, we
   proceed to state the way by which a sinner may return to God. Is it not
   well to have it packed away in a small compass and expressed in common
   words? We tell them that Jesus Christ came into the world to save
   sinners and that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have
   everlasting life. What could we do if the Gospel were not, thus, plain?
   Must I have a handcart and wheel it about with me, so as to carry to
   each dying man half-a-dozen folios in Latin? Nothing of the kind! Right
   well do Cowper's often-quoted lines set forth the plainness of the
   Gospel and rebuke those who reject it on that account--

   "Oh how unlike the complex work of man,

   Heaven's easy, artless, unencumbered plan!

   No meretricious graces to beguile,

   No clustering ornaments to clog the pile--

   From ostentation as from weakness free,

   It stands like the sky-blue arch we see,

   Majestic in its own simplicity!

   Inscribed above the portal from afar

   Conspicuous as the brightness of a star,

   Legible only by the light they give,

   Stand the soul-quickening words--

   Believe and Live!

   Too many, shocked at what should charm them must,

   Despise the plain direction and are lost.

   Heaven on such terms? (They cry with proud disdain)--

   Incredible! Impossible and vain!--

   Rebel because 'tis easy to obey,

   And scorn, for its own sake, the gracious way."

   III. Thirdly, IN THE TRUE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL, THIS SIMPLICITY IS
   PRESERVED. Paul expressly said-- "Having this hope in us, we use great
   plainness of speech." And again, "My speech and my preaching was not
   with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit
   and of power." The Apostle Paul was a deep thinker, a man of profound
   insight and subtle mind. The bent of his mind was such that he would
   have made a metaphysician of supreme rank, or a mystic of the deepest
   darkness--but he went against his natural inclinations and devoted all
   his energies to the unveiling of the Gospel! It was a sublime
   self-denial for him to put on one side all his logic among the other
   things which he counted loss for Christ--for he says, "I determined not
   to know anything among men save Jesus Christ and Him crucified."

   He "determined." He was resolute and had made up his mind to it, or he
   would not have accomplished it. He was the man who wrote some things
   hard to be understood, which Peter mentions, but when he came to the
   Gospel, he would have nothing but simplicity! He was tender among them
   as a nurse with her child and made himself an instructor of babes,
   dealing out the Word of God with such plainness as children would
   require! The true man of God will not veil the Gospel beneath
   performances and ceremonies! Mark those who do this and avoid them! We
   see "His Reverence" walking with clasped hands to the right and to the
   left, repeating Latin sentences unknown by the people! He turns and
   bobs, and turns again! We see his face for a moment and then his back.
   I suppose it is all meant for edification--but I, poor
   crea-ture--cannot find the least instruction in it, nor, as far as I
   can discover, do the people who are looking on!

   What do these little boys in pretty gowns, making such a smoke, mean?
   And what are these flowers and images on the altar? What a splendid
   cross is that which adorns the priest's back! It seems to be made of
   roses. The folks look on and some are wondering where he buys his lace,
   while others are speculating as to the quantity of wax which will be
   consumed in those candles every hour--and there is the end of
   it--Christ is veiled behind the millinery, if He is there at all! I
   know numbers who would disdain to do that and yet they hide their Lord
   under finery of language. It is a grand thing to mount aloft upon the
   wings of eloquence and display the Glory of speech till you ascend, in
   a splendid peroration, as many another exhibition closes with
   fireworks. But this is not becoming to preachers of the Lord Jesus!

   I always tell our young men that one of their commandments should be,
   "You shall not ramble on." To attempt anything grand in language when
   we are preaching salvation is to leave our proper work! Our one
   business is to tell out the Gospel plainly. We deal in bread, not in
   flowers! Let tawdry ornaments be left to the stage or to the bar, where
   men amuse themselves or dispute for gain--or let these poor gewgaws be
   reserved for the Senate where men will defend or denounce according as
   it suits their party. It is not ours to make the worse appear the
   better, or to hide the Truth of God under floods of words. As for us,
   we are to hide ourselves behind the Cross and make men know that Jesus
   Christ came to save the lost--and that if they believe in Him they
   shall be saved at once and forever! If we do not make them know this,
   we have missed our mark, however grandly we have performed. What? Shall
   we become acrobats with words, or jugglers displaying wonders? Then God
   is insulted, His Gospel is degraded and souls are left to perish!

   I venture to put in a word for myself and then leave this point. I can
   say with the Apostle, "I have used great plainness of speech" and,
   therefore, if the Gospel which I have preached is hidden, I have not
   produced the veil. I have used vulgar words when I thought that they
   would be better understood and I have told all sorts of simple stories
   when I thought I could make the Gospel known. I have never used a hard
   word where I could help it. My one desire has been by manifesting the
   Truth of God to touch your consciences and win your hearts. If you see
   not the light, it is not because I have hidden it from you.

   IV. With this we close. IF THE GOSPEL IS VEILED TO OUR HEARERS, IT IS A
   FATAL SIGN. "If our Gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost."
   The god of this world has blinded their unbelieving eyes lest the light
   of the glorious Gospel of Christ should dawn upon them. Not to believe,
   understand, appreciate and accept the Gospel is a sign of perishing. I
   want to put this very plainly to any here who say that they have not
   received the Gospel because they cannot understand it and they see
   nothing remarkable in it. If you have heard it plainly preached, it is
   so plain in itself that if it is hid from your eyes it is because you
   are still in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity!

   You who receive the Gospel are saved! Faith is the saving token. If you
   believe that Jesus is the Christ, you are born of God--if you have
   accepted Him as your Savior whom God sets forth as such--then you are
   saved. But if you say, "No, I cannot see it," then your eyes are
   blinded and you are lost! The sun is bright enough, but those who have
   no sight are not enlightened. Do you say, "I cannot receive the Gospel.
   I need something more difficult"? By sinful pride your judgment is
   perverted and your heart is hardened! While you are still among the
   unbelieving, you are still among the perishing--and the god of this
   world blindfolds you! O Spirit of God, convince men of this sin--that
   they believe not on Jesus Christ. This work is out of Your servant's
   power, but, oh, You perform it! Oh that our text, like a sharp knife,
   may cut deep and reach the conscience! May this Truth of God pierce
   between the joints and marrow and discern the thoughts and intents of
   your hearts!

   According to the text, he that believes not on Jesus Christ is a lost
   man. God has lost you--you are not His servant. The Church has lost
   you--you are not working for the Truth. The world has lost you,
   really--you yield no lasting service to it. You have lost yourself to
   right, to joy, to Heaven. You are lost, lost, lost, like the prodigal
   son when he was away from his father's house. You are lost like the
   sheep that went astray from the fold. It is not only that you will be
   lost, but that you are lost, for, "He that believes not is condemned
   already, because he has not believed on the Son of God." Press those
   two words upon your conscience-- "Condemned already"--lost even now!
   You are perishing! That is to say, you are gradually passing into that
   condition in which you must abide forever as one that has perished
   before God and become utterly useless and dead.

   It is an appalling truth that this is proved by the fact that you do
   not understand the Gospel, or, if you understand it, you do not
   appreciate it--you do not see beauty or Glory in it, or, if you do, in
   a measure appreciate it, and see some Glory in it, yet it has never
   stirred your affection or drawn your heart towards its great Subject.
   In a word, you have not come to trust in Jesus! He is the only One that
   you can trust to salvation and yet you reject Him! It must be the
   simplest thing in all world to trust in Christ and yet you will not do
   that simple thing! Trust in Him should be attended to at once and ought
   not to be delayed--and yet you have delayed for years! If faith brings
   salvation, why not have salvation? Why abide, still, in unbelief--in
   unbelief of the most glorious Truth that God, Himself, ever revealed to
   men--in unbelief of that which you dare not deny? Oh, what a condition
   to be in--willfully in darkness, shutting your eyes to the Light of
   God! You are certainly lost!

   The Apostle explains how a man gets into that condition. He says that
   Satan, the god of this world, has blinded his mind. What a thought it
   is that Satan should set up to be God! Christ is the image of God.
   Satan is the imitator of God--he mimics God and holds an usurped power
   over men's minds and thoughts. To maintain his power, he takes great
   care that his dupes should not see the light of the Gospel. The veils
   he uses are such as men's selfish hearts approve, for he speaks
   thus--"If you were to become a Christian, you would never get on in the
   world." He claps a sovereign on each eye and then you cannot see,
   though the sun shines at midday! Pride binds a silken band across the
   eyes and thus, again, the Light of God is excluded. Satan whispers, "If
   you become a Christian, you will be laughed at!" And he hoodwinks his
   victim with fear of ridicule. He has many a crafty device by which he
   perverts the human judgment till they cannot see that which is
   self-evident--and will not believe that which is unquestionable!

   He makes the gain of Heaven to seem inconsiderable when weighed with
   the little loss which religion may involve. He hides from the soul the
   bliss of forgiven sin, of adoption into God's family and the certainty
   of eternal Glory by throwing dust into the eyes, so that the mind
   cannot look at things truthfully. What shall I say, in closing, but
   this--are you lost, any of you? Upon the showing of the text all of you
   are to whom the Gospel is hidden! Well, but thank God you may yet be
   found--lost today, but you need not be lost tomorrow! Lost while
   sitting in these pews--but you may be found before you leave the
   Tabernacle! The Good Shepherd has come to find His lost sheep. Have you
   any desire after Him? Have you any wish to return to Him? Then look to
   Him with a trustful glance!

   You are not lost if so you look, nor shall you ever be! He that
   believes in Jesus is saved and saved eternally. Are any of you blinded?
   You must be so if the Gospel is hid from you, so that you cannot see
   its brightness. Ah, but you need not remain in the dark! There is One
   here, today, who opens blind eyes! Cry to Him as did the two blind men,
   "You, Son of David, have mercy on me! You, Son of David, have mercy on
   me!" The Messiah came on purpose to give sight to the blind--it was a
   part of His commission when He came forth from the Father's Glory. He
   will give sight to you! Oh seek it! Is the god of this world your
   master? He must be if you do not see the Glory of the Gospel! But he
   need not be your god any longer! I pray the Holy Spirit to help you to
   dethrone this intruder. Why should you adore him? What good has he ever
   done for you? What is there about his character that makes him worthy
   to be your god?

   Break off his yoke! Burst the fetters which now hold you his slave. The
   true God has come in the flesh to set you free and to destroy all the
   works of the devil! Whatever keeps you from beholding the Glory of God
   in the face of Jesus Christ can be removed. I am sent to say, in my
   Master's name, "Whoever believes in Him is not condemned: he that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." "Come now, and let us reason
   together, says the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool." Trust the Savior, trust the Incarnate God! Trust Him now and
   trust Him at once--and though a moment ago you were black as Hell's
   midnight, you shall be clean and bright as Heaven's eternal noon!

   In one instant sins that have taken you 50 years to accumulate shall
   disappear! The transgressions of all your days shall be plunged beneath
   the sea and shall be found no more! Only be willing and obedient--and
   yield yourselves up to the Incarnate God who always lives to take care
   of those who put their trust in Him! May the Lord bless you, dear
   Friends, forevermore. Amen and amen.

"Jehovah-Rophi"

   (No. 1664)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 11, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I am the Lord who heals you." Exodus 15:26.

   WE shall consider this passage in its context, for I have no doubt that
   the miracle at Marah was intended to be a very instructive illustration
   of the glorious title which is here claimed by the Covenant God of
   Israel-- "I am Jehovah-Rophi, the Lord that heals you." The
   illustration introduces the sermon of which this verse is the text. The
   healing of the bitter waters is the parable of which the line before us
   is the lesson. How different is the Lord to His foes and to His
   friends! His Presence is light to Israel and darkness to Egypt. Egypt
   only knew Jehovah as the Lord that plagues and destroys those who
   refuse to obey Him. Is not this the Lord's memorial in Egypt, that He
   cut Rahab and wounded the dragon? He overthrew their armies at the Red
   Sea and drowned their hosts beneath the waves! But to His own people,
   in themselves but very little superior to the Egyptians, God is not the
   terrible Avenger consuming His adversaries, but, "Jehovah that heals
   you."

   Their mental and moral diseases were almost as great as those of the
   Egyptians whom the Lord cut off from before Him, but He spared His
   chosen for His Covenant's sake. He bared the sword of Justice against
   rebellious Pharaoh and then He turned His tender, healing hand out to
   His own people, to exercise towards them the heavenly surgery of His
   Grace. Israel knew Him as the Lord that heals and Egypt knew Him as the
   Lord that smites! Let us adore the Grace which makes so wide a
   difference--the Sovereign Grace which brings salvation unto Israel--and
   let us confess our own personal obligations to the mercy which has not
   dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities!

   Again, how differently does God deal with His own people from what we
   should have expected. He is a God of surprises! He does things which we
   looked not for. God deals with us not according to our conception of
   His ways, but according to His own wisdom and prudence, for as the
   heavens are high above the earth, so high are His thoughts above our
   thoughts. You would not have supposed that a people for whom God had
   given Egypt as a ransom would have been led into the wilderness of
   Shur--neither would you have guessed that a people so near to Him that
   He cleft the sea and made them walk between two glassy walls dry
   shod--would have been left for three days without water!

   You naturally expect to see the chosen tribes brought right speedily
   into a condition of comfort, or, if there must be a journey before they
   reach the land that flows with milk and honey, you look at once for the
   smitten rock and the flowing stream, the manna and the quails and all
   the other things which they can desire. How singular it seems that
   after having done such a great marvel for them, the Lord should cause
   them to thirst beneath a burning sky and, that, too, when they were
   quite unprepared for it, being quite new to desert privations, having
   lived so long by the river of Egypt where they drank of sweet water
   without stint.

   We read at other times, "You, Lord, did send a plenteous rain, whereby
   You did refresh Your inheritance when it was weary." But here we meet
   with no showers! No brooks gushed forth below and no rain dropped from
   above. Three days without water is a severe trial when the burning sand
   is below and the blazing sky is above! Yet the Lord's people, in some
   way or other, are sure to be tried--theirs is no holiday parade--but a
   stern march by a way which flesh and blood would never have chosen. The
   Egyptians found enough water and even too much of it, for they were
   drowned in the sea, but the well-beloved Israelites had no water at
   all! So is it with the wicked man--he often has enough of wealth and
   too much of it--till he is drowned in sensual delights and perishes in
   floods of prosperity. He has his portion in this life and in that
   portion he is lost, like Pharaoh, in the proud waters.

   Full often the Lord's people are made to know the pinch of poverty.
   Their lives are made wretched by sore bondage and they faint for a
   morsel of bread--they drink from a bitter fountain which fills their
   inward parts with gall and wormwood. They are afflicted many times,
   almost to the breaking of their hearts. One of them said, "All the day
   long

   have I been plagued and chastened every morning." They lie at the rich
   man's gate full of sores, while the ungodly man is clothed in scarlet
   and fares sumptuously every day. This is God's strange way of dealing
   with His own people. He Himself has said, "As many as I love I rebuke
   and chasten." "He scourges every son whom He receives." Thus He made
   His people know that the wilderness was not their rest, nor their
   home--for they could not even find such a common necessity as water
   with which to quench their thirst!

   He made them understand that the promised brooks that flowed with milk
   and honey were not in the wilderness, but must be found on the other
   side of Jordan, in the land which God had given to their fathers--and
   they must journey there with weary feet. "This is not your rest," was
   the lesson of their parched lips in the three-day march. You know what
   teaching there is in all this, for your experience answers to it. Do
   not marvel, Beloved, if with all your joy over your vanquished sin,
   which shall be seen by you no more, you yet have to lament your present
   grievous needs. The children of Israel cried, "What shall we drink?"
   This was a wretched sequel to, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has
   triumphed gloriously." Have you never made the same descent? If you are
   in poverty you are, no doubt, tempted to put that trinity of questions,
   "What shall we eat? What shall we drink? And with what shall we be
   clothed?"

   You are not the first to whom this temptation has happened. Do not
   marvel at all if up from the triumph of the Red Sea, with a song in
   your mouth and a timbrel in your hand, you ascend into the great and
   terrible wilderness and enter upon the land of drought! This way lies
   Canaan and this way you must go. Through much tribulation we must enter
   the Kingdom of God and, therefore, let us set our minds to it. By this
   grievous test the Lord was proving His people and causing them to see
   what was in their hearts. They would have known no wilderness outside
   if there had not been a wilderness within--neither had there been a
   drought of water for their mouths if the Lord had not seen a drought of
   Grace in their souls. We are fine birds till our feathers are
   ruffled--and then what a poor figure we cut! We are a mass of diseases
   and a bundle of disorders and, unless Grace prevents, we are the sure
   prey of death. O Lord, we pray to be proven, but we little know what it
   means!

   Let this suffice for an introduction and then let our text come in with
   comfort to our hearts, "I am the Lord that heals you." It was to
   illustrate this great name of God that the tribes were brought into so
   painful a condition! And, indeed, all the experience of a Believer is
   meant to glorify God, that the Believer, himself, may see more of God
   and that the world outside may also behold the Glory of the Lord.
   Therefore the Lord leads His people up and down in the wilderness and,
   therefore, He makes them cry out because there is no water--all to make
   them behold His power, His goodness and His wisdom. Our lives are the
   canvas upon which the Lord paints His own Character.

   We shall try, this morning, to set forth before you, by the help of the
   Divine Spirit, this grand Character of God, that He is the God that
   heals us. First, we shall notice the healing of our circumstances,
   dwelling upon that in order the better to set forth the greater fact,
   "I am the Lord that heals you." Secondly, we shall remember the healing
   of our bodies which is here promised to obedient Israel and we shall
   set forth that Truth of God, in order to bring out our third point,
   which is the healing of our souls. "I am the Lord that heals you"--not
   your circumstances, only, nor your bodily diseases, only, but yourself,
   your soul, your truest self--for there is the worst bitterness, there
   is the sorest disease and there shall the grandest power of God be
   shown to you and to all who know you.

   I. THE GLORIOUS JEHOVAH SHOWS HIS HEALING POWER UPON OUR CIRCUMSTANCES.
   The fainting Israelites thought that when they came to Marah they
   should slake their thirst. Often enough the mirage had mocked them as
   it does all thirsty travelers--they thought that they saw before them
   flowing rivers and palm trees--but as they rushed forward, they found
   nothing but sand, for the mirage was deluding them. At last, however,
   the waters of Marah were fairly within sight and they were not a
   delusion! Here was real water and they were sure of it. No doubt they
   rushed forward, helter-skelter, each man eager to drink--and what must
   have been their disappointment when they found that they could not
   endure it!

   A thirsty man will drink almost anything, but this water was so bitter
   that it was impossible for them to receive it. I do not read that they
   had murmured all the three days of their thirsty march, but this
   disappointment was too much for them. The relief which seemed so near
   was snatched away! The cup was dashed from their lips and they began to
   murmur against Moses and so, in truth, against God. Here was the proof
   of their imperfection--they were impatient and unbelieving. Have we
   not, too often, fallen into the same sin? Brethren, let your conscience
   answer! When you have felt a

   sharp affliction and it has continued a long time and you have been
   wearied out with it, you have, at last, seen a prospect of escape, but
   that prospect has completely failed you. What woe is this!

   When the friend you so surely relied upon tells you that he can do
   nothing. When the physician upon whom you put such reliance informs you
   that his medicine has not touched the malady. When the last expedient
   that you could adopt to save yourself from bankruptcy--the last arrow
   in your quiver has missed the mark--how your spirit has sunk within you
   in dire despair! Then your heart has begun to wound itself, like the
   scorpion, with its own sting. You have felt as if you were utterly
   spent and ready for the grave. The last trial was too much for you! You
   could bear up no longer. Happy have you been if under such conditions
   you have not been left to give way to murmuring against God.

   These poor Israelites were in a very pitiable condition. There was the
   water before them, but its horrible flavor made them shrink from a
   second taste. Have you not experienced the same? You have obtained that
   which you thought would deliver you, but it has not helped you. You
   looked for light and beheld darkness; for refreshment and beheld an
   aggravated grief. The springs of earth are brackish until Jehovah heals
   them--they increase the thirst of the man who too eagerly drinks of
   them. "Cursed is he that trusts in man and makes flesh his arm." Now,
   dear Friends, in answer to prayer, God has often healed your bitter
   waters and made them sweet. I am about to appeal to your personal
   experience, you that are truly pilgrims under the guidance of your
   heavenly Lord.

   Has it not been so with you? I should have no difficulty in refreshing
   your memories about Marah, for very likely its bitterness is in your
   mouth, even now, and you cannot forget your sorrow. But just now I wish
   to refresh your memories about what came of that sorrow. Did not God
   deliver you? Did He not, when you cried to Him, come to your rescue? I
   appeal to facts which may be stubborn things, but they are also rich
   encouragements. Has not the Lord oftentimes made our bitter waters
   sweet by changing our circumstances altogether? When the poor in heart
   have been oppressed, God has taken away the oppressor, or else taken
   the heart away from the oppression. When you have been in great straits
   and could not see which way to steer, has not the Lord Jesus seemed to
   open before you a wider channel, or Himself to steer your vessel
   through all the intricacies of the narrow river and bring you where you
   would come?

   Have you not noticed in your lives that most remarkable changes have
   taken place at times when anguish took hold upon you? I can bear my
   witness, if you cannot, that the Lord has great healing power in the
   matter of our trials and griefs. He has changed my circumstances in
   Providence and in many ways altered the whole aspect of affairs. On
   other occasions the Lord has not removed the circumstances and yet He
   has turned sorrow into joy, for He has put into them a new ingredient
   which has acted as an antidote to the acrid flavor of your affliction.
   You were not allowed to leave the shop, but there came a fresh manager
   who shielded you from persecution! You were not permitted to quit your
   business, but there came a wonderful improvement in your trade and this
   reconciled you to the long hours! You were not made to be perfectly
   healthy, but you were helped to a medicine which much lessened the
   sharpness of the pain--thus has your Marah been sweetened. Have you not
   found it so?

   The weight of your affliction was exceedingly great, but the Lord found
   a counterbalance and, by placing a weight of holy joy in the other
   scale, He lifted up your load and its weight was virtually taken away!
   You have been at Marah, but even there you have been able to drink, for
   a something has been put into the waters of afflictive Providence which
   has made them endurable. And where this has not been done, the Lord
   has, by a heavenly art, made your bitter waters sweet by giving you
   more satisfaction with the Divine will, more submission, more
   acquiescence in what the Lord has ordained. After all, this is the most
   effectual remedy. If I cannot bring my circumstances to my mind, yet if
   God helps me to bring my mind to my circumstances, the matter is made
   right.

   There is a degree of sweetness about pain, poverty and shame when once
   you feel, "The loving Lord ordained all this for me--my tribulation is
   of His appointing." Then the soul, feeling that the affliction comes
   from a Father's hand, accepts it and kicks against the pricks no
   longer. Surely, then, the bitterness of life or of death will be past
   when the mind is subdued to the Eternal will! These people said, "What
   shall we drink?" and they would have concluded that Moses was mocking
   them if he had answered, "You shall drink the bitter water." They would
   have said, "We cannot bear it! We remember the sweet water of the Nile
   and we cannot endure this nauseous stuff." But Moses would have said,
   "Yes, you will drink this and nothing else but this and it will become
   to you all that you need." Even so, Beloved, you may have quarreled
   with your circumstances and said, "I must have a change! I can no
   longer bear this trial."

   Has not the Lord of His Grace changed your mind and so influenced your
   will that you have really found comfort in that which was uncomfortable
   and content in that which made you discontented? Have you never said,
   when under tribulation, "I could not have believed it. I am perfectly
   happy under my trial and yet when I looked ahead to it, I dreaded it
   beyond measure. I said it would be the death of me, but now I find that
   by these things men live and in all this is the life of my spirit." We
   exclaim with Jacob, "All these things are against me," but the Lord
   gives us more Grace and we see that all things work together for
   good--and we bless the Lord for His afflicting hand! So you see the
   Lord Jehovah heals our bitter waters and makes our circumstances
   endurable to our sanctified minds.

   Brothers and Sisters, all this which you have experienced should be to
   you a proof of God's power to make everything that is bitter, sweet.
   The depravity of your nature will yet yield to the operations of His
   Grace! The corruptions that are within you will yet be subdued and you
   shall enter into the fullest communion with God in Christ Jesus! I know
   you shall, because the Lord is unchangeable in power and what He has
   done in one direction He can and will do in another. Your circumstances
   were so terrible and yet God helped you--and now your sins, your inbred
   sins, which are so dreadful--He will help you against them and give you
   power over them. You shall overcome the power of evil! By His Grace you
   shall be sanctified and you shall manifest the sweetness of holiness
   instead of the bitterness of self! Can you believe it? Does not God's
   power exhibited in Providence around you prove that He has power enough
   to do great things within you by His Grace?

   Moreover, should not this healing of your circumstances be to you a
   pledge that God will heal you as to your inner spirit? He that brought
   you through the sea and drowned your enemies will, also, drown your
   sins, till you shall sing, "The depths have covered them! There is not
   one of them left." He that turned your Marah into sweetness will yet
   turn all your sense of sin into a sense of pardon! All the bitterness
   of your regret and the sharpness of your repentance shall yet be turned
   into the joy of faith and you shall be full of delight in the perfect
   reconciliation which comes by the precious blood of Christ! Sustaining
   Providences are to the saints sure pledges of Divine Grace! The
   sweetened water is a picture of a sweetened nature--I almost said it is
   a type of it! God binds Himself by the gracious deliverances of His
   Providence to give you equal deliverances of Grace. It is joyous to
   say, "He is the Lord that healed my circumstances," but how much better
   to sing of His name as "The Lord that heals you"?

   Do not be contented till you reach to that! But do be confident that He
   who healed Marah will heal you--He that has helped you to rejoice in
   Him in all your times of trouble will sustain you in all your struggles
   with sin till you shall more sweetly and more loudly praise His blessed
   name!

   II. Let us now proceed a step further. As we have spoken of God's
   healing our circumstances, so now we have to think of THE LORD'S
   HEALING OUR BODIES. Why are diseases and pains left in the bodies of
   God's people? Our bodies are redeemed, for Christ has redeemed our
   entire manhood, but if Christ is in us, the body is still dead because
   of sin, even though the spirit is alive because of righteousness. It is
   not till the Resurrection that we shall enjoy the full result of the
   redemption of the body. Resurrection will accomplish for our bodies
   what regeneration has done for our souls. We were born again. Yes, but
   that Divine work was exercised only upon our spiritual nature--our
   bodies were not born again--therefore they still abide under the
   liability of disease, decay and death, though even these evils have
   been turned into blessings.

   This frail, sensitive and earthly frame, which Paul calls, "this vile
   body," grows weary and worn and, by-and-by, it will fade away and die
   unless the Lord shall come. And even if He should come, this feeble
   fabric must be totally changed, for flesh and blood, as they now are,
   cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. Neither can corruption dwell with
   incorrup-tion. Even to this day the body is under death because of sin
   and is left so on purpose to remind us of the effects of sin-- that we
   may feel within ourselves what sin has done--and may the better guess
   at what sin would have done if we had remained under it, for the pains
   of Hell would have been ours forever. These griefs of body are meant, I
   say, to make us remember what we owe to the redemption of our Lord
   Jesus, and so to keep us humble and grateful.

   Aches and pains are also sent to keep us on the wing for Heaven, even
   as thorns in the nest drive the bird from its sloth. They make us long
   for the land where the inhabitant shall no more say, "I am sick." Yet
   the Lord does heal our bodies. First He heals them by preventing
   sickness. A prevention is better than cure. The text says, "If you will
   diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord, your God, and will do that
   which is right in His sight, and will give ear to His com-

   mandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases
   upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord
   that heals you."

   It is concerning this same healing Lord that we read, "You shall not be
   afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flies by day;
   nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for the destruction
   that wastes at noonday. A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten
   thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you. Only with
   your eyes shall you behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because
   you have made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, your
   habitation; there shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague
   come near your dwelling." Do we sufficiently praise God for guarding us
   from disease? I am afraid that His preserving care is often forgotten.

   Men will go 30 or 40 years, almost, without an illness, and forget the
   Lord, in consequence. That which should secure gratitude creates
   indifference! When we have been ill, we come up to the House of the
   Lord and desire to return thanks because of our recovery. Ought we not
   to give thanks when we are not ill and do not need to be recovered?
   Should it not be to you healthy folks a daily cause of gratitude to God
   that He keeps away those pains which would keep you awake all night and
   wards off those sicknesses which would cause your beauty to consume
   away like the moth? But we see this healing hand of the Lord more
   conspicuously when, like Hezekiah, we have been sick and have been
   restored.

   Sometimes we lie helpless and hopeless like dust ready to return to its
   fellow dust. We are incapable of exertion and ready to be dissolved.
   Then if the Lord renews our youth and takes away our sickness, we
   praise His name--and so we ought! It is not the doctor; it is not the
   medicine--these are but the outward means--it is the Lord who is the
   true Physician and unto Jehovah-Rophi be the praise! "I am the Lord
   that heals you." Let those of us that have been laid aside and have
   been again allowed to walk abroad, lift up our hearts and our voices in
   thanksgiving to the Lord who forgives all our iniquities, who heals all
   our diseases!

   According to the analogy of the healing of Marah, the Lord does this by
   means, for He cast a tree into the water. Those who will use no
   medicine, whatever, certainly have no Scriptural warrant for their
   conduct. Even where cures are given to faith, yet the Apostle says, "Is
   any sick? Let him send for the elders of the Church, and let them pray
   over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord." The
   anointing with oil was the proper medicine of the day and, possibly, a
   great deal better medicine than some of the drugs which are used
   nowadays. To the use of this anointing the promise is given, "and the
   prayer of faith shall raise the sick." Hezekiah was miraculously
   healed, but the Lord said, "Take a lump of figs and lay it upon the
   sore."

   God could have spoken a word and turned Marah sweet, but He did not
   choose to do so! He would exercise the faith and obedience of His
   people by bidding them cast a tree into the waters. The use of means is
   not to hinder faith, but to try it. Still, it is the Lord who works the
   cure and this is the point which is so often forgotten. Oh, come, let
   us sing unto Jehovah who has said--"I am the Lord that heals you"! Do
   not attribute to secondary means that which ought to be ascribed to
   God! His fresh air, warm sun, or bracing wind and refreshing showers do
   more for our healing than we dream of, or if medicine is used, it is He
   who gives virtue to the drugs and so, by His own Almighty hands, works
   out our cure. As one who has felt His restoring hand, I will personally
   sing unto Him who is the health of my countenance and my

   God.

   Note this, that in every healing of which we are the subjects, we have
   a pledge of the Resurrection. Every time a man who is near the gates of
   death rises up, again, he enjoys a kind of rehearsal of that grand
   rising when from beds of dust and silent clay the perfect saints shall
   rise at the sound of the trumpet of the archangel and the voice of God!
   We ought to gather from our restorations from serious and perilous
   sickness a proof that the God who brings us back from the gates of the
   grave can also bring us back from the grave, itself, whenever it shall
   be His time to do so! This should also be a further proof to us that if
   He can heal our bodies, the Lord can heal our souls! If this poor
   worm's meat, which so readily decays, can be revived, so can the soul
   which is united to Christ and quickened with His life! And if the
   Almighty Lord can cast out evils from this poor dust and ashes which
   must ultimately be dissolved, much more can He cast out all manner of
   evils from that immaterial spirit which is yet to shine in the
   brightness of the Glory of God!

   Therefore, both from His healing your souls and from His healing your
   bodies, gather power to believe in the fact that He will heal your
   mental, moral and spiritual diseases! Lift up your hearts with joy as
   you sing of Jehovah-Rophi, "The Lord that heals YOU."--

   "Sinners of old, You did receive,

   With comfortable words and kind,

   Their sorrows cheer, their needs relieve,

   Heal the diseased and cure the blind.

   And are You not the Savior still,

   In everyplace and age the same?

   Have You forgot Your gracious skill,

   Or lost the virtue of Your name?

   Faith in Your changeless name I have;

   The good, the kind Physician, You

   Are able now our souls to sa ve,

   Are willing to restore them now.

   Though eighteen hundred years are past

   Since You did in the flesh appear,

   Your tender mercies ever last;

   And still Your healing power is here! Would You the body's health
   restore,

   And not regard the sin-sick soul?

   The sin-sick soul You love much more,

   And surely You shall make it whole." The healing of Marah and the
   healing of the body are placed before the text and they shed a light
   upon it. They place this name of the Lord in a golden frame and cause
   us to look upon it with the greater interest.

   III. Now we come to THE HEALING OF OUR SOULS. The Lord our God will
   heal our spirits and He will do it in somewhat the same manner as that
   in which He healed Marah. How was that? First, He made the people know
   how bitter Marah was. There was no healing for that water till they had
   tasted it and discovered that it was too brackish to be endured! But
   after they knew its bitterness, then the Lord made it sweet for them.
   So is it with your sin, my Brothers and Sisters! It must become more
   and more bitter to you. You will have to cry out, "O wretched man that
   I am, who shall deliver me?" You will have to feel that you cannot live
   upon anything that is within yourself. The creature must be made
   distasteful to you and all trusts that come of it, for God's way is
   first to kill and then to make alive--first to wound and then to heal.
   He begins by making Marah to be Marah and afterwards He makes it sweet!

   What next? The next thing was there was prayer offered. I do not know
   whether any of the people possessed faith in God, but if so, they had a
   prayerless faith, and God does not work in answer to prayerless faith.
   "Oh," says one, "I am perfectly sanctified." How do you know? "Because
   I believe I am." That will never do! Is a man rich because he believes
   he is? Will sickness vanish if I believe myself to be well? Some even
   think it useless to pray because they feel sure of having the blessing.
   That putting aside of prayer is a dangerous piece of business! If there
   is not the cry to God for the blessing, yes--and the daily cry for
   keeping and for sanctification--the mercy will not come. Again, I say,
   healing comes not to a prayerless faith. You may believe what you like,
   but God will only hear you when you pray. Faith must pour itself out in
   prayer before the blessing will be poured into the soul. Moses cried
   and he obtained the blessing--the people did not cry and they would
   have been in an evil case had it not been for Moses. We must come to
   crying and praying before we shall receive sanctification, which is the
   making whole of our spirits.

   Marah became sweet through the introduction of something outside of
   itself--a tree. I know not of what kind. The rabbis say that it was a
   bitter tree and naturally would tend to make the water more bitter,
   still. However that may be, I cannot imagine any tree in all the world,
   bitter or sweet, which could have power to sweeten such a quantity of
   water as must have been at Marah! The transaction was miraculous and
   the tree was used merely as the instrument and no further. But I do
   know a tree which, if put into the soul, will sweeten all its thoughts
   and desires--Jesus knew that tree, that tree whereon He died and shed
   His blood as a victim for our sin!

   If the merit of the Cross is imputed to us and the spirit of the Cross
   is introduced into our nature. If we trust the Lord Jesus and rest upon
   Him. Yes, if we become Cross-bearers and our soul is crucified to the
   world--then we shall find a marvelous change of our entire nature!
   Whereas we were full of vice, the Crucified One will make us full of
   virtue! And

   whereas we were bitter towards God, we shall be sweet to Him and even
   Christ will be refreshed as He drinks of our love; as He drinks of our
   trust; as He drinks of our joy in Him! Where all was acrid, sharp and
   poisonous, everything shall become pure, delicious and refreshing! But
   we must first experience a sense of bitterness--then cry out to the
   Lord in prayer and then yield an obedient faith which puts the unlikely
   tree into the stream--then the Divine power shall be put forth upon us
   by Him who says, "I am the Lord that heals you." The inner healing is
   set forth as in a picture in the sweetening of the bitter pools of
   Marah. I know I am right in saying so, because we are told of Moses,
   "There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved
   them."

   Again, the task of turning Marah sweet was a very difficult one. No
   human power could have achieved it and, even so, the task of changing
   our nature is not only difficult, but impossible to us. We must be born
   again, not of the will of man, nor of blood, nor of the will of the
   flesh, but of God. There was no turning Marah sweet by any means within
   the reach of Moses or the myriads that came up with him out of Egypt.
   This wonder must come from Jehovah's hands. So is the change of our
   nature a thing beyond all human might. Who can make his own heart
   clean? God must work this marvel! We must be born again from above, or
   else we shall remain in the gall of bitterness even unto the end.

   But yet the work was very easy for God. How simple a thing it was just
   to take a tree and cast it into the bitter water and find it sweet at
   once! Even so it is an easy thing for God to make us a new heart and a
   right spirit and so to incline us to everything that is right and good.
   What a blessing is this! If I had to make myself holy, I must despair!
   And if I had to make myself perfect, and keep myself so, it would never
   be done! But the Lord Jehovah can do it and has already begun to do it!
   Things which I once hated I now love--all things have become new.
   Simple faith in Jesus Christ and the putting of the Cross into the
   stream does it all, and does it at once, too! And does it so
   effectually that there is no return of the bitterness, but the heart
   remains sweet and pure before the living God.

   The task was completely accomplished. The people came and drank of
   Marah just as freely as they afterwards drank of Elim or of the water
   that leaped from the smitten rock. So God can and will complete in us
   the change of our nature. Paul says, "I am persuaded that He that has
   begun a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ." The
   Lord has not begun to sweeten us a little with the intent of leaving us
   in a half-healed condition, but He will continue the process till we
   are without trace of defilement and made pure and right in His sight.
   This work is one which greatly glo-rifles God. If the change of Marah's
   water made the people praise God, much more will the change of nature
   make us adore Him forever and ever! We are going to be exalted,
   Brethren, by-and-by, to the highest place in the universe--next to God!
   Man, poor, sinful man, is to be so changed as to be able to stand side
   by side with Christ, who has, for that very purpose, taken upon Himself
   human nature. We are to be above the angels! The highest seraphim shall
   be less privileged than the heirs of salvation!

   Now, the tendency to pride would be very strong upon us, only that we
   shall always remember what we used to be and what power it was that has
   made us what we are. This will make it safe for God to glorify His
   people. There will be no fear of our sullying God's honor, or setting
   ourselves up in opposition to Him, as did Lucifer of old. It shall
   never be said of any spirit washed in the precious blood of Jesus, "How
   are you fallen from Heaven, O son of the morning!" for the process
   through which we shall pass in turning our bitterness to sweetness will
   fill us with perpetual adoration and with constant reverence of the
   unspeakably mighty Grace of God! Will it not be so, Brethren? Do not
   your impulses even now lead you to feel that, when you gain your
   promised crowns, the first thing you will joyfully do will be to cast
   them at the feet of Jesus, and say, "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto
   Your name be Glory forever and ever"?

   That sweetened Marah was all of God--our renewed nature shall be all of
   God. We shall not be able to take the slightest particle of credit to
   ourselves, nor shall we wish to do so. Brothers and Sisters, the Lord
   will do it! He will be sure to do it because it will glorify His name.
   Let us draw comfort from this fact--there will be no interfering with
   the Lord by a rival claimant to honor! There will be no idolatry in us
   taking away part of His praises! Therefore He will do it and change our
   bitterness into perfect sweetness. Blessed be His name, He can do
   it--nothing will baffle the skill of "the Lord that heals you."

   Whenever I am cast down under a sense of corruption, I always like to
   get a hold of this Divine name, "The Lord that heals you." "Thanks be
   to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
   "Faithful is He that has called you, who also will do it," says the
   Apostle. He has not undertaken what He will fail to perform. Jehovah,
   who made Heaven and earth, has undertaken to make us perfect and to
   effectually heal us--therefore let us be confident that

   it will assuredly be accomplished and we shall be presented without
   spot before God! He who heals us is a God so glorious that He will
   certainly perform the work. There is none like unto the Omnipotent One!
   He is able to subdue all things unto Himself. His wisdom, power and
   Grace can so work upon us that where sin abounded Grace shall much more
   abound--

   "You can o vercome this heart of mine!

   You will victorious prove,

   For everlasting strength is Yours

   And everlasting love.

   Your powerful Spirit shall subdue

   Unconquerable sin;

   Cleanse this foul heart, and make it new,

   And write Your Law within."

   He is a God who loves us so and makes us so precious in His sight that
   He gave Egypt for our ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for us! A God so loving
   will surely perfect that which concerns us.

   Moreover, a God so fond of purity, a God who hates sin so intensely and
   who loves righteousness so fervently will surely cleanse the blood of
   His own children! He must and will make His own family pure! "This
   people have I formed for Myself: they shall show forth My praise." The
   devil cannot hinder that decree. "They shall," says God, and they
   shall, too--no matter what shall stand in their way! They must and they
   shall show forth God's praise.

   Now, as you have believed in God for your justification and found it in
   Christ, so believe in God for your sanctifica-tion, that He will work
   in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure! Believe that
   He will exterminate in you the very roots of sin--that He will make you
   like Himself, without taint or speck, and that, as surely as you are
   trusting in Christ, you shall be whiter than snow, pure as the infinite
   Jehovah--and you shall stand with His First-Born, accepted in the
   Beloved! My soul seems to grasp this and to hold it all the more firmly
   because the Lord has turned my bitter circumstances into sweetness and
   has healed the sickness of my body.

   Because of these former mercies, I know that He will heal the sickness
   of my spirit, and I shall be whole, that is to say, holy, without spot
   or trace of sin and so shall I be forever with the Lord. "Therefore
   comfort one another with these words." Brothers and Sisters, if the
   Lord has taken you into His hospital and healed you, do not forget
   other sick folk! Freely you have received, freely give! Give today to
   the hospitals in which so many of the poor are cared for and relieved.
   Do it for Jesus' sake and may the Lord accept your offerings!

The Exceeding Riches of Grace

   (No. 1665)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 18, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "That in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His
   Grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus." Ephesians 2:7.

   FROM this verse it is clear that Paul fully expected the Gospel of the
   Grace of God to be preached in the ages to come. He had no notion of a
   temporary Gospel to develop into a better, but he was assured that the
   same Gospel would be preached to the end of the dispensation. Nor this
   alone, for as I take it, he looked to the perpetuity of the Gospel, not
   only through the ages which have already elapsed since the first Advent
   of our blessed Lord, but throughout the ages after He shall have come a
   second time. Eternity, itself will not improve upon the Gospel. When
   all the saints shall be gathered Home they shall still talk and speak
   of the wonders of Jehovah's love in Christ Jesus! And in the golden
   streets they shall stand up and tell what the Lord has done for them to
   listening crowds of angels, principalities and powers.

   Paul did not believe in the quenching of the light of the testimony of
   Grace, but expected that throughout the ages to come it would burn on
   with the same brilliance. This I infer from the fact that he looked
   upon the believing Ephesians and himself as having been converted in
   the dawn of Christianity, on purpose, that to later ages they might
   serve as specimens of what the Gospel can do. He looked upon these
   Ephesians, newly drawn out from the cesspool of idolatry, in the same
   light as he looked upon himself when he said that the Lord had shown
   towards him all long-suffering for a pattern to them that should
   hereafter believe on His name. Paul and these Ephesians--and all those
   early Christians--were types to us of what God can do by the Gospel and
   of what He will continue to do until the present dispensation shall
   close.

   From this statement we may gather with most sure logic that the Gospel
   is altogether unalterable, for if its results 1,800 years ago are to
   serve us as proofs of its power, then it must be the same Gospel. It is
   clear that the converts of the first century would not be, to us, any
   kind of testimony to the power of the Gospel as it now exists among us
   if, meanwhile, there had been a change in the Gospel, itself! At best,
   such facts could only show what the old-fashioned Gospel did in its
   day, but we could not infer from them what a new-fangled Gospel will
   now accomplish. Paul did not at all anticipate any removal of the old
   landmarks. He held it forth that the same results would follow in all
   ages from the preaching of the same Gospel with the same power from
   Heaven and, therefore, he regarded the first converts as pledges and
   proofs to all succeeding ages of what the Gospel could achieve.

   Hold, my Brothers and Sisters, to that Gospel which has been delivered
   unto you, which we have received by the Spirit of God through the
   teaching of Christ and of His Apostles, and you shall yet see repeated
   in your midst the same things which were worked in those early days!
   Those who will, may drink the new wine of the modern vintage--my
   conviction is that the old is better! Learn, also, from this language
   of Paul, that every age is a gainer by those which preceded it. I have
   smiled, often, in this place, at the conceit of this 19th Century which
   holds up its head among the ages as far excelling them all, though if
   it knew itself, it would sing to a more modest tune. But now I will
   moderate my tone, and admit that this century is superior to all the
   ages that have been before it--superior in this one respect--that it
   has received by the lapse of time the fullest and most repeated
   evidence of the Gospel's power!

   Whereas in the Second Century men could only refer to the experience of
   the saints during 100 years, we have, at this hour, the accumulated
   evidence of almost 1,900 years--and all this is put in evidence as
   proof of what Divine Grace can do. Whereas in the third, fourth, and
   fifth centuries men had the accumulated personal testimonies of those
   who had, till then, believed in Christ and had been saved thereby, we,
   upon whom the ends of the earth have come, have now far larger
   evidence, because the time has supplied us with a greater cloud of
   witnesses! For nearly 2,000 years, this Gospel has been

   preached among men! And every year has brought fresh trophies to its
   power--every day, I might say, is now producing evidence of its Divine
   power!

   We have not, today, dear Friends, to begin to test the Gospel. The ice
   is broken for us--experiments have been made so frequently that we have
   now entered upon another stage. It is not ours to analyze the bread,
   but to feed upon it! We have not, today, to enquire, "Can we ford the
   stream?" Lo, these 19 centuries the hosts of God have gone through the
   flood in safety and we have but to join their ranks and follow where
   they lead the way! Surrounded by evidence that is altogether
   overwhelming, we behold the Gospel of Jesus going forth, conquering and
   to conquer! We hear from ten thousand times ten thousand voices the
   cry, "Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God." We cannot
   cease to proclaim the mercy of God as displayed in the atoning
   Sacrifice of our Lord Jesus, for infallible assurances strengthen our
   confidence and set our hearts on fire!

   The multitudes of converts in past time make known to us in these ages
   that there is salvation--no, more--that this salvation is to be had,
   for they obtained it! No, further--that it is to be had upon the terms
   that God has laid down of simply believing in Jesus Christ--for they
   obtained it in that way and in none other! Doubt ought now to be out of
   the question! Every needy, trembling sinner should hasten away to the
   refuge supplied by Jesus. Because so many have been to Him with
   success. Because He has never rejected any. Because He has saved to the
   uttermost all those that have come to Him, therefore sinful men ought
   eagerly and unquestioningly to come at once and put their confidence in
   the Lamb of God! Then will God's purpose, as described in the text, be
   accomplished, that to the ages to come should be made known by all who
   have tasted of His kindness the exceeding riches of His Grace toward
   men in Christ Jesus the Savior!

   This morning I have a text before me which is a great deal too full for
   me--I can never draw out all its supplies. I have gone round the walls
   of this city text; I have counted its towers and marked well its
   bulwarks, but I am utterly unable to express myself by reason of joyous
   astonishment! I feel as if I must sit down and lose myself in
   adoration. I am a poor dumb dog over such a theme! I believe that if I
   were shut up to preach for 12 months from this text, I should not be
   straitened for matter, but rather, when I had finished the 52 Sabbaths,
   I should be eager to enter upon another year's consideration of the
   same topic! Here is a vast and fruitful country--a land of hills and
   valleys, a land of fountains and brooks of water--who shall spy it out
   and set the bounds thereof?

   I shall try to exhibit a cluster from Eshcol, but the whole land I
   cannot show you--it behooves you to journey there for yourselves. It is
   a right royal subject-- "The exceeding riches of His Grace in His
   kindness toward us through Christ Jesus." Whitefield and Wesley might
   preach the Gospel better than I do, but they could not preach a better
   Gospel! I shall preach with the longing desire that others may be
   enticed to come and taste of the dainties of Christ's marriage-feast.
   To this end I shall rehearse the loving kindnesses of the Lord. Oh that
   the Holy Spirit may help me--and draw you!

   We begin with--I. THE KINDNESS OF THE LORD TOWARD US IN CHRIST JESUS.
   What kindness He displayed in choosing such sinners as we were! These
   Ephesians had been most superstitious idolaters. You know how loudly
   they shouted, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians." There was no
   preparedness in them to cast away their idols and to worship the great
   Invisible God. There was nothing in them to draw them towards the light
   that shines in the Christ of God. They were far off, as Paul says,
   having no hope and really and truly without God in the world--and yet
   these were the very men whom the exceeding riches of God's Grace
   brought out of darkness into the marvelous Light of God!

   They were "dead in trespasses and sins." They walked according to the
   course of the world, according to the prince of the power of the air.
   They fulfilled the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were sunk
   in all manner of loathsome lusts and vices. And yet the Grace of God
   came to men of Ephesus and called out a Church to show forth the
   praises of God! Now, what were we, my Brothers and Sisters? We were not
   idolaters, nor sunk in all the degradation of Ephesus, but we were all
   sinners in some fashion or other. All the sheep went astray--though
   each one followed a different way, all took the downward road--and we
   among them. We, to the utmost of our power, fulfilled the lusts of the
   flesh and of the mind--we did evil even as we could.

   If it had not been for the restraints of education and the checks of
   our surroundings, I know not into what crimes we would not have
   plunged. It is a happy circumstance, for some of us, that God met with
   us very early, or else we would have been swept away by the torrents of
   our youthful passions into the worst possible vices. We always had a
   strong will, a firm purpose and courage equal to any daring--these
   qualities under the devil's influence would soon have forced a passage
   to Hell for us! If we had been left to sow our wild oats, what a crop
   we would have had long before this. Thanks

   be to God for His preventing love! Alas, some, left to wander far, were
   allowed to prove, in their lives, the sin which dwelt in them--and what
   a wonder of Grace, what a miracle of love that God should have selected
   them, after all, and brought them near to Himself!

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, I will not enlarge upon this, for this is a
   point for your private meditations. Shut yourselves up in your closets
   and think of what you were and what you would have been if it had not
   been for the kindness of God toward you in Christ Jesus. Forget not
   that the Lord has shown this kindness toward us in order that others
   like we are may be induced to believe in the same kindness. Are any
   here the children of pious parents who have done violence to your
   consciences? After the same fashion did many of us terribly rebel--and
   yet the Lord has had mercy upon us! Have some of you fallen into the
   lusts of the flesh and followed after the pleasures of sin and thus
   defiled yourselves greatly? Do not despair of pardon, for there are
   some here who tearfully remember how the God of pardons forgave them
   after they had fallen into the same sins. Whatever form your
   transgression may take, God has saved others who fell into similar sins
   in order that in them He might make known to you His willingness to
   clasp you to His bosom and to cast your sins behind His back!

   No doctrine, however clearly stated, will ever have such influence over
   men as living examples. When we can say of this one and of the other,
   "These were great offenders. These were open sinners. These were
   grievous transgressors, but they obtained mercy," we do, in effect, say
   to all of the same character, "Come, and you shall not be refused!
   Leave your sin as they have done--loathe it as they do! Trust in Jesus
   as they have been taught to do and you shall find equal mercy with them
   and shall rejoice in the common salvation." The kindness of God toward
   us--how I delight to dwell on the word, "us," and then to take it up
   and acknowledge my own personal share in it--the kindness of God toward
   me! Do this, my Brethren, and then go and display to others the
   kindness of the Lord toward your own souls.

   But our attention is called not only to the persons whom God chose, but
   to His kindness displayed in the gracious acts which He has done
   towards them. Mark the exceeding riches of His Grace in His kindness
   toward us. What has He done for us? He chose us before He lit the
   stars, those torches of the sky! He wrote our names upon the heart and
   hands of Christ before He laid the foundations of the hills! In the
   fullness of time He gave Christ for us, even that blessed Christ of
   whom we say, "Who loved me and gave Himself for me." He made with us in
   Christ Jesus a Covenant ordered in all things and sure which shall
   stand fast when all created things dissolve.

   Having done this, He watched over us when we were bond-slaves to the
   tyrant Satan. Graciously He guarded us from going still further into
   transgression and committing the sin which is unto death. Then He
   called us--and when we would not come He drew us yet more forcibly by
   His effectual Grace till, at last, we yielded. Oh, I cannot tell all
   that He did for us when we at last came to Jesus, but this I know, He
   washed us and we were whiter than snow! He brought forth the best robe
   and put it on us and made us comely in His sight. He gave us the kiss
   of sweet acceptance and He put us among the children. And since then He
   has given us the children's portion and has dealt with us as He used to
   deal with those that love His name. We have been adopted into the
   family and we have lived on the children's bread--we have been guided,
   led, instructed, upheld and sanctified! And the almighty Savior is
   still performing miracles of mercy for us!

   The old tale of the giants piling mountain upon mountain, Pelion upon
   Ossa, is outdone by our God! He has not only heaped up one hill of
   mercy, but He has laid mountain upon mountain--He has piled up Alps
   upon Alps to make a pathway for us, that we may ascend to the right
   hand of God, even the Father, and sit in the heavenly places with
   Christ! What has He done? I answer, what has He not done? What more
   could He do? Can you suggest a mercy? He has already given it! Can you
   desire a favor? It is yours, already, and was yours from before the
   foundation of the world! Oh, the goodness, the manifold goodness, the
   overflowing, surpassing, inconceivable goodness of God in His kindness
   toward us through Christ Jesus!

   I am bound to dwell a moment on that last word--His kindness toward us
   through Christ Jesus. That is the channel through which all blessing
   has come to us! God gives common mercies to men as His creatures, but
   these riches of His Grace, these Covenant blessings, all come to us as
   His chosen, through the Mediator! You can see the mark of the Cross on
   every spiritual favor which the Father has bestowed--some drops of
   bloody sweat have fallen upon every treasured gem of the Covenant
   treasure box. And does not this endear the mercy of God to you--that it
   comes through Jesus Christ? It seems to me to enhance its value and to
   make every Covenant blessing more and more dear because it is brought

   to us by the hand of the Well-Beloved! By His Atonement it is procured
   to us and by His matchless intercession it is actually bestowed!

   Said I not right well that I have a theme which is too deep and high
   for me? I might detain you many a day upon this one word, "through
   Christ Jesus," through the Incarnate God, through His life and death
   and Resurrection, and His intercession at the right hand of the Throne
   of the Majesty on high! All things come to us through Christ Jesus! He
   is the golden pipe of the conduit of eternal love, the window through
   which Grace shines, the door by which it enters! Get these two or three
   words and sit down and turn them over and over and over in your
   souls--and see if there is not the very music of Heaven sleeping within
   them--which your faith may call forth and coin into hallelujahs! "The
   exceeding riches of His Grace in His kindness toward us through Christ
   Jesus"--this is an anthem worthy of the celestial choirs! Sing it, O
   you chosen of the Lord, while you are waiting to ascend His holy hill!

   II. But now I take a step further and get into the soul of the text.
   Let us consider--"THE EXCEEDING RICHES OF HIS GRACE." Here, our English
   is a poor language as compared with the Greek, and I believe that Paul
   groaned, even when he was writing the matchless Greek of the text,
   because he could not make it express all his meaning. Even the Hebrew,
   which seems to be the most expressive of all human tongues and might
   well have been spoken in Paradise, cannot contain or set forth the
   fullness of God's great thoughts--but here the Greek is wonderful! What
   if I read the words, "the hyperbolical wealth of Grace, or the
   super-abounding, excessive, overflowing riches of the Grace of God"?

   If I were to heap up epithets, I could not give you all that Paul
   means. Only notice, first, that the riches of the Grace of God are
   above all limit. A man is not rich when he can count his money, or miss
   this and that when he has spent it. We used to read in our first Latin
   books, "It is the mark of a poor man to number his flocks"--the rich
   man has so many sheep that he cannot count them. When a person becomes
   immensely wealthy, he is richer than he needs to be and has not only,
   enough, but much to spare! So is it with the Grace of God--He has as
   much Grace as you need--and He has a great deal more than that! The
   Lord has as much Grace as a whole universe will require, but He has
   vastly more. He overflows!

   All the demands that can ever be made on the Grace of God will never
   impoverish Him, or even diminish His store of mercy! There will remain
   an incalculably precious mine of mercy as full as when He first began
   to bless the sons of men! In a country village, if a man has a few
   hundred pounds, he is thought to be quite rich. You get into a large
   town--there a man must have several thousands! But when you come to
   London and frequent the Stock Exchange, you enquire of so-and-so, "Is
   he a rich man?" and someone will, perhaps, reply, "Yes, yes. He is
   worth a hundred thousand pounds." Put that same question to a
   Rothschild with his millions and he answers, "No, he is a little man.
   He is not rich. He only owns a hundred thousand pounds." These great
   bankers count their money by millions!

   Well, but what are these great Rothschilds with all their millions when
   they are reckoned up according to the wealth of Heaven? They are
   nowhere at all! Only the Lord is rich. "If I were hungry," He says, "I
   would not tell you, for the world is Mine and the fullness thereof." He
   says, "The silver and the gold are Mine and the cattle on a thousand
   hills." God is so rich in mercy that you cannot tell how rich He is!
   His is overflowing riches, marvelous riches, exceeding riches! God is
   excessive in nothing that I know of except in His mercy. He has
   boundless in all His attributes, but emphatically so in His love--for
   God is Love! His Grace is above all observation. The little Grace which
   you have seen--you stop me and exclaim, "Sir, I have seen great Grace."
   So you have, for you! But the little Grace you have seen, I say, bears
   no proportion to the glorious whole!

   You have not seen as much of God's Grace as a man might see of the sea
   if he stood upon the beach at Brighton or at Hastings. "Why," you reply
   in surprise, "I can see as much of the ocean, there, as any mortal man
   can see." That may be, but men's eyes have but a narrow range! I tell
   you, you have never beheld the sea, but only a trifling portion of it.
   If a man crosses from America, he has gazed upon a narrow furrow along
   which his vessel has plowed its way, but no one has ever beheld to the
   full, the vast, majestic ocean in all its length, breadth and depth!
   Nobody can see it in all its far-resounding shores and hollow caves!
   Such is the "exceeding riches" of God's Grace unsearchable, passing
   knowledge! Oh my poor tongue and my dull language! I must leave my
   subject, for it overflows my soul and drowns my speech. You must think
   it out for yourselves. The Grace of God surpasses all you know, all you
   see and all you think.

   So I remark, next, that this Grace is above all expression, yes, even
   Inspired expression. Paul, though full of the Holy Spirit, could not
   speak out all the love of God in Christ Jesus, for His love is
   unspeakable! "Thanks be to God for His

   unspeakable Grace." If we had all the tongues of men and of angels, we
   could not declare all the riches of the Grace of God! No, if all the
   orators that ever lived made this their one and only theme and if all
   of these were under the influence of the Divine Spirit, yet human
   language could not compass this Divine thing--

   "Words are but air, and tongues but clay, And this compassion is
   Divine.'" If we knew the language of angels we could not, then, declare
   the Grace of God! The most experienced saints bewail the weakness of
   every form of speech to describe the exceeding riches of the Grace of
   God.

   We are compelled to add that it is above all our ways of action. The
   Gospel has taught us to forgive, but we do not take to it naturally. If
   anyone treats us very ill it is with some difficulty that we forgive.
   And there are certain base, cruel and ungrateful treatments which it
   becomes almost impossible to overlook and, if we forgive, yet we do not
   always forget. But such is the greatness of God's mercy that we who
   have wearied ourselves with iniquity and wearied Him with our sins, yet
   have not outworn His compassion. It is hard for us to pardon, but it is
   spontaneous with God. He delights in it--"He delights in mercy."
   Twenty-six times in one Psalm the sweet singer proclaims that, "His
   mercy endures forever." How he rings that bell again, and again, and
   again--"For His mercy endures forever!"

   Your mercy is very short and your temper is quick so that you speak
   unadvisedly and angrily very soon--but it is not so with God. So
   wondrous are His ways of Grace that they are past finding out! We
   cannot follow them and can scarcely believe them because they are so
   unlike ours! His ways are above our ways and His thoughts above our
   thoughts as much as the heavens are above the earth! The gentlest,
   meekest and most loving minds are left far behind in this race of love.
   Man is miserly in forgiveness, but the Lord is rich in mercy. Our
   little stream of goodness runs after much pumping and pressure, but the
   river of Divine Love flows freely on.

   Yes, and the ways of Grace are above our understanding! Some famous
   minds have been born into the world, every now and then, men who have
   explored the sun, threaded the stars, and pried into the heart of the
   earth and told us of its ancient history. God raises up, every now and
   then, master minds to perceive and reveal His wisdom in Nature. But
   there never was and never shall be a human understanding that can fully
   grasp the incomprehensible riches of the mercy of God in Christ Jesus!
   Sit down and think it over and look intently into this mystery--and you
   will find it far beyond you. "It is high, I cannot attain unto it."

   I have set myself, this day, to study this matter, but I have barely
   touched it as with a swallow's wing! I have not dived into the
   fathomless depths, nor can I! Jehovah is such a marvelously forgiving
   God, so rich in His mercy, that our understanding cannot count the
   mighty sum. Yes, and if our thoughts were raised to the utmost--if we
   were sanctified to the highest degree, if we were so pure in heart as
   to see God--not even, then, should we be able to know all the exceeding
   riches of His Grace to us who believe! The loftiest thought of the most
   saintly mind never rose to the height of this great argument! The most
   masterly poetic conception faints, its wing droops and it falls to
   earth in the presence of this mercy which is higher than the heavens
   and far above the clouds! I wish I could say something that would make
   men know how vast is the mercy of God. Oh that these lips had language!
   Perhaps my failure may be better than fluency. If so, I would gladly be
   dumb to let Mercy, itself, speak.

   Furthermore, dear Friends, the exceeding riches of God's Grace may be
   guessed at by the fact that Divine Mercy is above all our sins. You
   cannot sin so much as God can forgive! If it comes to a pitched battle
   between sin and Grace, you shall not be so bad as God shall be good. I
   will prove it to you. You can only sin as a man, but God can forgive as
   a God! You sin as a finite creature, but the Lord forgives as the
   infinite Creator. When I received that thought fairly into my soul last
   night, I felt like Abraham when he laughed for joy--I sin like a man,
   but He forgives like a God! We will never sin that Grace may
   abound--that were infamous and detestable!

   But what a blessed text is that--"Where sin abounded Grace did much
   more abound." Your sin is like a mountain, but if you have faith as a
   grain of mustard seed you shall say to this mountain, "Be you removed,
   therefore, and cast into the midst of the sea of God's infinite mercy,"
   and it shall be done unto you! The atoning blood will wash out all
   transgression and not a trace of it shall remain. Does not this fact
   magnify the mercy of God? Gross and intolerable as your sin may be, yet
   it is but as a drop in a bucket compared with the immense ocean of
   forgiving love! Try again. God's mercy is greater than His promises.
   "Oh, no," you say, "that will not do! We have read of 'exceeding great
   and precious promises.'" I tell you His mercy has a Glory beyond His
   promises, for His mercy is the father of His promises!

   The Lord had mercy and Grace before He had spoken a single promise and
   it was because His heart was flaming with love that He made a Covenant
   of Grace and wrote, therein, the words of peace. His promises are
   precious streams that come leaping up in the deserts of our lost and
   ruined state. But the depth that lies under, which Scripture calls,
   "the depth that couches beneath," is richer than the fountain which
   comes out of it! The mercy of God is the source and the wellhead is
   greater than the promises which flow from it--infinitely greater than
   our straitened interpretations of the promises--which fall far short of
   their real meaning! And even that meaning, did we know it, cannot set
   forth all "the exceeding riches of His Grace in His kindness toward us
   through Christ Jesus."

   Let us try again. God's mercy is greater than all that all His children
   have ever received as yet. His redeemed are a multitude that no man can
   number and each one draws heavily upon the Divine Bank, but,
   notwithstanding all the Grace He has ever given to them, (and He has
   given to each of them a measureless portion), yet there is more Grace
   in God than He has given forth as yet. "Oh," you say, "how can that
   be?" It is so because His mercy is not all given out in this life--much
   of it is laid up for enjoyment in the world to come. The Grace which we
   have not yet tasted is the very crown of the feast! The Lord has
   prepared, for them that love Him, an inconceivable bliss!

   There is Heaven, there is Glory, there is all the bliss of the endless
   ages yet laid up in store. Oh the wealth of these heavenly reserves! I
   am sure I stated the Truth of God when I said that what the Lord has
   given does not comprehend all the exceeding riches of His Grace--He has
   infinitely more to give. You have seen the river Thames go rolling
   along, the abounding and rejoicing river--and you see the cattle come,
   on a hot day, and stand knee deep in the stream, and drink, drink,
   drink. There is more water in the Thames than all the bullocks in all
   earth's pastures ever drank, or will drink. They may be driven from
   every prairie under Heaven and stand on the river's brink and drink as
   though they would suck up Jordan at a draught, but they will never
   diminish the wealth of Father Thames!

   But even if they could, you and I would be still as far off from all
   possibility of draining the wondrous flood of mercy which comes flowing
   forth from beneath the Throne of God! The rain of Grace has filled the
   pools, but it will rain, again, none the less plentifully. God's
   ability to give is greater than our capacity to receive. The fact is
   that this Grace is above all measure. Yet we have four measures for
   it--height, depth, breadth, length--and this mercy of God is so
   exceedingly great that in each of these measures it baffles
   description! It is higher than our sin, though that is exceedingly
   heinous and proudly threatens the gates of Heaven! It is higher than
   our thoughts, though our imagination, sometimes, takes a condor's
   flight. Oh, the height of Divine Mercy! It rises to the Throne of the
   Eternal!

   As for the depths of Grace--the sea has immense depths, but the mercy
   of God is altogether unfathomable! Great sins sink into it and are
   lost, but Grace is just as deep, after it has swallowed up a world's
   sin, as it was before. There are inconceivably deep places in God's
   mercy where the blackest sins are lost. Out of these come the choicest
   pearls of Grace. Oh the depths! As for the breadth of mercy, David
   says, "As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our
   transgressions from us." What greater breadth can be conceived? As for
   the length of it, it is from everlasting to everlasting! Can anybody
   tell me the length of that? My sins began less than 50 years ago, but
   the Lord's mercy began-- oh, when did it begin?

   It was always with Him and His plans of mercy are from everlasting!
   There is a beginning to man's sin, but there is no beginning to
   pardoning Love. I shall cease to sin, I hope, long before another 50
   years are over, and I shall be beyond fear of further fault. But the
   mercy of the Lord will never end, world without end! Who, then, can
   compass a matter which, in any one of its measurements, far surpasses
   all human computation? Grace is above all calculation! Hasten here, you
   great sinners! You are not great as compared with the Lord's great
   mercy in Christ Jesus! We cannot allow you to apply the word, "great,"
   to your sin--we need to reserve it for the mercy of God! We must
   monopolize the word, for all greatness dwells in the love and mercy of
   our God. However much you may have wandered, however black you may be,
   however defiled, God delights in mercy--it is the joy of His heart to
   pass by transgression and sin through the precious blood of Christ!

   Do not do my Lord so great a dishonor as to measure your sin and affirm
   that it outstrips His mercy! It cannot be! You know nothing about the
   glorious Nature of my Lord. A child may fill its little cup out of the
   great sea, but the sea never misses it. Your sin is like that cup and
   you may fill it to the brim with mercy, but the ocean of love will
   never miss all that you can take from it! Come, take all that you can
   take, and none shall question you! Wash out your crimson stains in this
   pure flood and it shall remain as pure as at the first! I would not
   speak lightly of your sin--it is an exceed-

   ingly great and grievous thing--but still, I do say over, again, that
   as compared with the infinite mercy of God it is but as a shadow to the
   sun, or a grain of sand to the full ocean at its flood!

   III. These riches of Grace deserve TO BE STILL FURTHER ILLUSTRATED and
   I shall illustrate them only by hints. What exceeding riches of Grace
   it was on God's part that when we resisted Him in the days of our sin
   He resolved to overcome our folly. If you offer a man a great kindness
   and he will not have it, you say, "Well, then, he must do without it. I
   am not going down on my knees to him to ask him to receive a favor from
   me." Yet the Lord pleads with sinners to accept His Grace. "Come now,
   and let us reason together, says the Lord." He begs and beseeches men
   that they will be saved! He entreats them! He pleads with them! He
   argues with them that they would turn to Jesus and live! Oh, the
   exceeding riches of His Grace!

   My Master, the Lord Jesus, came along to me and said, "Soul, will you
   have pardon and forgiveness?" And fool that I was, I answered, "No."
   Then He came, again, and said," Will you have Me and My salvation? I
   will take you to Heaven with Me." And I answered, "No." Ah, but He
   would not take, "No," for an answer! He had a sweet way of getting at
   my understanding and my will and He drew me till, at last, I cried
   after Him! How I ate my black and rebellious words! "O Lord," I said,
   "take no notice of what Your poor, poor child has said! Throw my
   obstinate refusals behind Your back and let me come to You." But, oh,
   the exceeding riches of His Grace that He should stand waiting, waiting
   long, and knocking at our door though we would not let Him in!

   The exceeding riches of His Grace were seen in making no conditions
   with us. When the Lord Jesus Christ met with us, He did not stand out
   for terms. I heard one say the other day, "I do not feel enough
   brokenness of heart nor enough humiliation of spirit." Who said that
   Christ demanded so much brokenness of heart and so much humbling of
   spirit before He would give His mercy? He who dared to say it knows not
   the freeness of the Gospel, for the Gospel comes to bring you the
   broken heart and the humbled spirit! And Christ comes to you just as
   you are, in all your alienation and your enmity, and brings everything
   in His hands that you can need. This is what we call Free Grace! A
   sharp critic said the other day, "Do not say 'Free Grace,' it is a
   tautology--Grace must be free."

   Ah, my dear Sir, but we shall say, "Free Grace," so that there shall be
   no mistake about it, for some, I dare say, will not know where we are
   unless we are redundant in our expressions upon this point! There was
   nothing in us to draw Christ to us. We had nothing good, but everything
   evil. When He came, He did not say, "Bankrupt sinner, you must pay two
   pence on the pound, and I will pay the other nineteen and ten pence."
   He paid all our debts, asking not a farthing from us! He saw us lying
   by the roadside, bruised and broken, and He did not say, "Come here,
   poor man; rise up, and I will bind your wounds." No, but He came where
   we were lying, unable to stir, and poured in the wine and the oil--and
   did it all without our help. This is the "exceeding riches of His
   Grace"--in not standing stipulating and huckstering with us, but freely
   giving to us all we need--only asking that we would receive it; that we
   would be empty and that He might fill us with His love.

   Beloved, I think I never knew "the exceeding riches of His Grace"
   better that when I was thinking, the other day, of how His Grace works.
   Why, He does all this with a word! He speaks a black sinner white! He
   speaks a dead sinner into life by a word. "Live," He says, and he that
   was dead lives! He that had been accounted unrighteous is, by God's
   will, reckoned righteous and he is righteous, for him whom God reckons
   to be righteous, by the imputation of Christ's righteousness is
   righteous, indeed! Yes, and he shall be rewarded for that righteousness
   which God, with a word, gives to him!

   If you need another proof of "the exceeding riches of His Grace" think
   of the power of the blood. Once washed in the crimson fountain, your
   every sin is gone, every spot is washed out! Yes, and gone never to
   return, for he that is once washed in the atoning blood will never be
   black, again! The cleansing is perfected forever. The glorious High
   Priest made one offering for sin, only one--He did it once and by that
   He annihilated all the sins of all His people at a single stroke--once
   and for all! Oh, "the exceeding riches of His Grace." His word, His
   blood have worked such wondrous mysteries of Grace. And since then,
   dear Friends, have not "the exceeding riches of God's Grace" been
   marvelous to you? To think that He should accept us as Believers though
   we had not more than half a grain of faith! He has even treated us as
   Believers when sometimes we have been more doubters than trusters.

   As for our repentance, it seemed such a poor shallow regret, yet He has
   reckoned it repentance and accepted it as such. Our love to Him! Oh,
   our poor love to Him has been like a spark hiding away in the ashes,
   yet He has called it love! He has known us better than we know
   ourselves and He has known we loved Him notwithstanding the feebleness
   of our

   affection! These poor, frail Graces of ours that we have been ashamed
   of, He has, nevertheless, rejoiced in them and had a joy in them as
   being the gift of His Spirit, of "the exceeding riches of His Grace."
   Ever since our conversion, the Lord has held on to us and helped us to
   hold on to Him. We have sorely tried Him time out of mind.

   Sometimes we talk about our trials. There is another side to that.
   Think of Christ's trials--how we have grieved Him! We must have
   provoked His spirit 10,000 times, yet He loves us infinitely and does
   not give us up! He has espoused us to Himself and He will never divorce
   us. He never sued out a divorce against a soul that was married to Him,
   nor ever will! He has not grown cold in His love--notwithstanding our
   chilliness--He loves us, now, with all His great and infinite heart!
   And, by-and-by, He will open the golden gates and He will say, "Come up
   here"--

   "Then, Lord, shall I fully know, but Not till then, how much I owe."

   But if, when I get to Heaven, I shall know what I owed Him here, I
   shall be in a greater difficulty than ever, for I shall not know what I
   then owe Him in His Glory!

   It is an enormous debt we owe Him for the blessings of time and,
   perhaps, in eternity we shall begin to calculate their value. But then
   we shall be sweetly oppressed with a new burden, in a sense, of the
   amazing mercy which He will then be giving us at His right hand. We may
   give up the endless task! We cannot possibly calculate the sum!
   Brothers and Sisters, we are all in an equal difficulty and shall be so
   forever, for the Lord will go on to deluge us with mercy, Grace and
   favor forever and forever! And we shall say to one another, when
   millions of years have gone, "Brother, is it not still astonishing? Do
   you seem to know much more of it than you did in the Tabernacle that
   morning when you heard the poor preacher try to do his best with his
   subject and he was utterly lost in it?" And you will say, "I know far
   more, but I am as far off as ever from knowing all, for now I know more
   of my ignorance. I know more of the extent of what I do not know."

   Brothers and Sisters, if what we do know and what we do not know are
   added together to make up the total sum of the Lord's Grace, what must
   it be?--

   "God only knows the love of God:

   Oh that it now were shed abroad

   In these poor stony hearts." God grant it, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The First Recorded Words of Jesus

   (No. 1666)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 25, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said unto Him,
   Son, why have You thus dealt with us? Look, Your father and I have
   sought You sorrowing. And He said unto them, How is it that you sought
   Me? Know you not that I must be about My Father's business?" Luke 2:48,
   49.

   THESE words are very interesting because they are the first recorded
   utterances of our Divine Lord. No doubt He said much that was very
   admirable while yet a Child, but the Holy Spirit has not seen fit to
   record anything except these two questions, as if to teach us that
   childhood should be retiring and modest--a stage of preparation rather
   than of observation. We hear little of a Holy Child, for modesty is a
   precious part of its character. We ought, therefore, to give all the
   more earnest heed to these words because they stand at the very
   forefront of our Lord's teaching and are, in some respects, the
   announcement of His whole life.

   Spoken, as they were, at 12 years of age, we may regard them as the
   last words of His childhood and the first words of His youth. He is
   just passing away from the time in which He could be called a child
   into that in which He becomes, in the eastern clime, where men ripen
   faster than here, a young Man, a son of the Law, fit to sit among the
   doctors in the temple and to be instructed by them. The early days of
   youth are very perilous, for then it is that the rest of life is often
   shaped. Happy, indeed, is he who so early begins with God and chooses
   as his business the service of the Lord! If all our youth had the same
   mind which was in Christ Jesus, what evidence we should have that the
   Spirit of God had been working upon our children and was now about to
   speak through our youth!

   I suppose that these words must have come into Luke's Gospel through
   Mary, herself. How, otherwise, could the evangelist have known that,
   "they understood not the saying which He spoke unto them," or that
   Mary, "kept all these sayings in her heart"? Mary evidently narrates
   the words of the Holy Child, words which she had pondered again and
   again. She treasured up for us the gems which dropped from Jesus' lips.
   She tells us that this saying, simple though it seems to be, was not
   fully understood either by herself or by His reputed father, Joseph.
   And yet, mark you, we are told, expressly, that Mary, "kept all these
   sayings in her heart."

   When you cannot put a Truth of God into your understandings, yet lay it
   up in your affections. If there is anything in God's Word which is
   exceedingly difficult, do not, therefore, reject it, but rather
   preserve it for future study. In a father's talk with his child there
   must be a good deal that the child cannot fully comprehend. If he is a
   wise child, he will seize upon the very thing he does not understand
   and treasure it for future use, expecting that light will spring out of
   it, by-and-by. Be not among those who say that they will limit their
   faith by their understanding! It is probable that you will have a
   narrow faith if it is so, or else you will have a wide conceit--for a
   proud conceit, alone, can make us believe that we are able to
   understand even one-tenth of what God has revealed!

   No, I will go further! Although we may understand enough to be saved by
   the Truth, yet the full depth of the Truths of God are understood by no
   man and if, therefore, we make it the rule to limit our faith by our
   understanding, we shall have an extremely limited range of faith! No,
   let us treasure up these things! Let us highly prize these diamonds
   which can only be cut by diamonds! Let us not put them aside because
   they are difficult, for it may be one index of their genuineness that
   they are so. We are grateful that the Spirit of God has given us this
   first word of our Lord Jesus and we love it none the less because it is
   a deep word.

   We are not surprised that even as a Child, the Son of God should give
   forth mysterious sayings. Do you wonder that there should be much in
   Scripture which you cannot comprehend, when even the first words of
   Christ, when He is yet a boy, is not understood? No, not understood by
   those who had nursed Him, who had lived with Him the whole 12 years
   and, consequently, knew His mode of speech and the peculiarities of His
   youthful language! If even Mary and Joseph did

   not understand, who am I, that I should forever be saying, "I must
   understand this or I will not receive it"? No, if we understand it not,
   yet will we keep all these sayings in our hearts, for we have this
   advantage--that the Holy Spirit is now given, by whose teaching we
   understand things which were hidden from the wisest saints of old!

   Beloved Friends, how great and full of meaning was this first word
   which seems so simple! The longer you look into it, the more you will
   be astonished at its fullness. Only superficiality and ignorance will
   think it plain! The closest student will be the most astonished with
   the profundity of its meaning. Stier, to whom I am much indebted for
   thoughts upon this subject, calls this text, "the solitary flower out
   of the enclosed garden of thirty years." What fragrance it exhales! It
   is a bud, but how lovely! It is not the utterance of His ripe manhood,
   but the question of His youth--yet this half-opened bud discovers
   delicious sweets and delightful colors worthy of our admiring
   meditation.

   We might call these questions of Jesus the prophecy of His Character,
   and the program of His life. In this, our text, He set before His
   mother all that He came into the world to do--revealing His high and
   lofty Nature and disclosing His glorious errand! This verse is one of
   those which Luther would call His little Bibles, with the whole Gospel
   compressed into it. What if I compare it to the perfume of roses, of
   which a single drop might suffice to perfume nations and ages? It would
   not be possible to overrate these "beautiful words! Wonderful words!
   Wonderful words of life!" Who, then, am I that I should venture to take
   such a text? I do not take it with any prospect of being able to unveil
   all its meaning, but merely to let you see how unfathomable it is.
   Emmanuel, God With Us, speaks divinely while yet in His youth! The
   words of THE WORD surpass all others! May the Spirit of God open them
   to us!

   I shall handle the text thus--First, here is the Holy Child's
   perception. Secondly, the Holy Child's home. Thirdly, the Holy Child's
   occupation, and fourthly, the Holy Child's lesson to any of us who may
   be seeking Him.

   I. Here we see THE HOLY CHILD'S PERCEPTION. Notice, first, that He
   evidently perceived most clearly His high relationship. Mary said,
   "Your father and I have sought You sorrowing." The Child Jesus had been
   known to call Joseph His father, no doubt, and Joseph was His father in
   the common belief of those round about Him. We read in reference to our
   Lord even at 30 years of age these words--"Being, as was supposed, the
   son of Joseph." The Holy Child does not deny it, but He looks over the
   head of Joseph and He brings before His mother's mind another Father.
   "Know you not that I must be about My Father's business?"

   He does not explain this saying, but it is evident enough that He
   remembered, then, the wonderful relationship which existed between His
   Humanity and the great God, for He was not conceived after the ordinary
   manner, but He had come into the world in such a fashion that it was
   said to Mary, "That Holy Thing which shall be born of you shall be
   called the Son of God." In a still higher sense and as a Divine Being,
   He claimed filial relationship with the Most High, but here, no doubt,
   He speaks as a Man, and as a Man He calls God, "My Father," after a
   higher fashion than we can do because of His mysterious birth.

   You notice that all through His life He never calls God, "Our Father,"
   although He bids us do so. We are children of the same family and when
   we pray we are to say, "Our Father which are in Heaven," but our Lord
   Jesus has still a filial relationship more special than ours and,
   therefore, to God He says on His own account, "My Father." He expressly
   claims this personal relationship for Himself and I am sure we do not
   grudge Him that relationship, for upon it our own relationship to the
   Father depends. Because He is the Son of the Highest, therefore we
   enter into the filial relationship with the Eternal One according to
   our capacity. Jesus the Child perceived that He was the Son of the
   Highest and with all the simplicity of childhood He declared the secret
   to His mother who already knew how true it was

   Brothers and Sisters, this Holy Child's perception should be an
   instruction to us. Do you and I often enough and clearly enough
   perceive that God is our Father, too? Do we not often act upon the
   hypothesis that we are not related to Him, or that we are orphans and
   that our Father in Heaven is dead? Do you not catch yourselves,
   sometimes, departing from under the influence of the spirit of adoption
   and getting into the spirit of independence--and of waywardness and
   sin? This will never do! Let us learn from this Blessed One that as He
   early perceived His high and eminent relationship to the Father, so
   ought we, also, even though we may be nothing more than children in
   Grace. We ought to know and to value beyond all expression our sonship
   with the great Father who is in Heaven. In truth this Truth of God
   should override every other and we should live and move and act under
   the consciousness of our being the children of God. O Holy Spirit,
   teach us this!

   This Holy Child, next, perceived the constraints of this relationship.
   He says, "Know you not that I must be about My Father's business?"
   Write that, "MUST," in capital letters! It is the first appearing of an
   imperious, "must," which swayed the Savior all along. We find it
   written of Him that, "He must go through Samaria," and He Himself said,
   "I must preach the Kingdom of God." And again to Zaccheus, "I must
   abide in your house," and again, "I must work the works of Him that
   sent Me." "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of
   the elders." "The Son of Man must be lifted up." "It behooved Christ to
   suffer." As a Son, He must learn obedience by the things which He
   suffered. This First-Born among many brethren must feel all the
   drawings of His Sonship--the sacred instincts of the holy Nature and,
   therefore, He must be about His Father's business.

   Now, I put this to you again, for I need to be practical all along--Do
   you and I feel this Divine, "must," as we ought? Is necessity laid upon
   us, yes, woe laid upon us unless we serve our Divine Father? Do we ever
   feel a hungering and a thirsting after Him so that we must draw near to
   Him and must come to His House and approach His feet and must speak
   with Him and must hear His voice and must behold Him face to face? We
   are not truly subdued to the Son-Spirit unless it is so. But when our
   sonship shall have become our master idea, then shall this Divine
   necessity be felt by us, also, impelling us to seek our Father's face!
   As the sparks fly upward to the central fire, so must we draw near unto
   God, our Father and our All.

   This Holy Child also perceived the forgetfulness of Mary and Joseph and
   He wondered. He sees that His mother and Joseph do not perceive His
   lofty birth and the necessities arising out of it--and He wonders. "How
   is it," He says, in a childlike way, "How is it that you sought Me?
   Know you not that I must be about My Father's business?" He is
   astonished that they do not recognize His Sonship; that they do not
   perceive that God is His Father! Does not Mary remember the angel's
   word at the Annunciation? Did she not know how He was born and remember
   His mysterious relationship to God? Of course she did! But she was a
   woman and as a woman she had nursed this Child, and she had brought Him
   up and, therefore, she began to forget the mystery which surrounded
   Him, in the sweet familiarities with which she had been indulged! And
   so she has to be reminded of it by her Child's wonder that she should
   have forgotten that He was the Son of the Highest.

   Have you those perceptions, dear children of God? Do you not often
   wonder why men do not know that you are a child of God? Have you
   sometimes spoken and they have smiled at you as if you were idiotic or
   fanatical, and you have thought to yourself, "What? Do they not know
   how a child of God should speak and how a child of God should act?"
   "Therefore the world knows us not, because it knew Him not."--

   "'Tis no surprising thing,

   That we should be unknown!

   The Jewish world knew not their King,

   God's everlasting Son."

   The spiritual man is not understood, He is a wonder unto many. Marvel
   not, my Brothers and Sisters, if carnal men do not understand you. Yes,
   even your own Brothers and Sisters in Christ--those who love your
   Father--have, sometimes, been astonished at you when you have only been
   acting simply out of your own renewed heart.

   Many Christians get so stilted that they are not like children at home.
   They act more like strangers or hired servants in the Father's house
   who have bread enough and to spare, but yet never can talk as the
   children do. Few let their hearts flow out with that holy fearlessness,
   that sweet familiarity which becomes a child of God. Why, if you and I
   went about the world under the full possession of this idea, "Beloved,
   now are we the sons of God," I have no doubt we would act in such a way
   that the mass of professors would be amazed at us and we should be
   still more amazed at their amazement and astonished at their
   astonishment! If we only acted as our innermost nature would dictate to
   us, what manner of persons we would be!

   So this Holy Child perceived His glorious Sonship, perceived the
   constraints of the Sonship working within Him and perceived that His
   parents did not comprehend His feelings. The Child Jesus began, also,
   to perceive that He, personally, had a work to do and so He said, "Know
   you not that I must be about My Father's business?" He had been 12
   years silent, but now the shadow of the Cross began to fall upon Him
   and He felt a little of the burden of His lifework. He perceives that
   He has not come here merely to work in a carpenter's shop, or to be a
   peasant child at Nazareth. He has come here to vindicate the honor of
   God, to redeem His people, to save them from their sins and to lead an
   army of blood-

   washed ones up to the Throne of the great Father above and, therefore,
   He declares that He has a higher occupation than Mary and Joseph can
   understand.

   Yet He must go back to the home at Nazareth and, for 18 years He must
   do His Father's business by, as far as we read, doing nothing in the
   way of public ministry! He must do His Father's business by hearing the
   Father, in secret, so that when He comes out, He may say to His
   disciples, "All things which I have heard of My Father I have made
   known unto you." So great a lesson had He to teach that He must spend
   another 18 years in learning it fully and God must open His ears and
   awaken Him morning by morning to hear as an instructed one, that
   afterwards He may come forth the Teacher of Israel, the Lord and Master
   of Apostles and evangelists!

   Beloved, I come back to the practical point again. Have you, with your
   sonship, obtained a vivid perception of your call and your work? You
   have not redemption set before you to accomplish, but you have to make
   known that redemption far and wide! As God has given to Christ power
   over all flesh that He may give eternal life to as many as the Father
   has given Him, so has Jesus given you power over such-and-such
   flesh--and there are some in this world who never will receive eternal
   life except through you! It is appointed that from your lips they shall
   hear the Gospel! It is ordained in the Divine decree that through your
   instrumentality they shall be brought into the Kingdom of God! It is
   time that you and I, who perhaps have reached 30, 40, 50 or 60 years,
   should now bestir ourselves and say, "Know you not that I must be up
   and doing my Father's business?"

   David had to wait till he heard the sound of a going in the tops of the
   mulberry trees--do you not hear the sound of a going now? Are there not
   signs and indications that you must work the will of Him that sent you
   and must finish His work? The night comes wherein no man can work. Up,
   then, you children of God, and, following the Holy Child Jesus, begin
   to ask this question--"Know you not that I must be about my Father's
   business?" These were the perceptions of this Holy Child. Oh that they
   may come strong upon us in our own smaller way! May we perceive that we
   are born of God! May we perceive the Spirit within us whereby we cry,
   "Abba, Father!" May we have a wonderment that others do not understand
   the calls and urgencies of our condition and may we have such a sense
   of our high calling as to proceed at once to fulfill it as God, the
   Holy Spirit, shall help us!

   II. We shall now think of THE HOLY CHILD'S HOME. Here I am obliged to
   amend our version and I am certain that the correction is, itself,
   correct. I am all the more strengthened in this opinion because the
   Revised Version endorses the ALTERATION. This is how they read
   it--"Know you not that I must be in My Father's house?" That may not be
   verbally exact, but it is the true sense. It should run thus, "Know you
   not that I must be in My Father's?" There is no word for "house," But
   in almost all languages, "house," is understood. You know how we
   commonly say to one another, "I am going down to my father's," or, "I
   shall spend the evening at my brother's." Everybody knows that we mean
   "house," and that is just how the Greek, here, runs. "Know you not that
   I must be in My Father's?" It means, "house."

   That must be the first and primary meaning of it. The text says nothing
   of business, unless we understand it to be included as a matter of
   course, since we may be sure that Jesus would not be idle in His
   Father's, for He said, "My Father works and I work." Observe that the
   question of Mary was, "Why have You thus dealt with us? Behold Your
   father and I have sought You sorrowing." The answer is, "Know you not
   that I must be in My Father's house?" That is plainly a complete answer
   and therein strikes you as more natural than a reference to business.
   If Jesus had only said, "Know you not that I must be about My Father's
   business?" it would not have been any guide to them as to where He
   would be, because all His life He was about His Father's business.

   But He was not always in the Temple. He was about His Father's business
   when He sat by the well and talked to the woman of Samaria. And He was
   about His Father's business when He trod the waves of the sea of
   Galilee. He might be anywhere and yet be about His Father's
   business--but the natural answer to the question was, "How is it that
   you sought Me? Know you not that I must be in My Father's house?" Let
   us read the passage thus, and see the child's home. Where should Jesus
   be but in His Father's dwelling place? I doubt not that with desire He
   had desired to eat that Passover when He should get to be 12 years old
   and be old enough to go up to His Father's house! He looked upon the
   Temple as being, for the time, the residence of God where He manifested
   Himself in an unusual degree--and so this Holy Child looked upon those
   walls and courts with delight as His Father's house.

   It seemed most natural to Him that when He reached the place He should
   stay there. He had never really been at home before. Nazareth was the
   place where He was brought up, but Jerusalem's Temple was on earth His
   true home. I

   picture to my mind how that blessed Child loved the place where His
   Father was worshipped! He would stand and gaze on the lambs and the
   bullocks that were slain in sacrifice, understanding much more about
   them, though a Child, than you or I do, though we are grown up. It must
   have been all wonderland to Him as a Child--I speak not of Him as God--
   it must have been all marvelous to Him and deeply interesting. When the
   Psalms went up, how He sang them with His sweet youthful voice! He said
   within Himself, "I must sing praises unto My Father." When the solemn
   prayers were uttered and He heard them, there were none so devout as He
   as He heard the people worship His Father in Heaven!

   It is touching to think of Him, in His Father's palace--He was greater
   than the Temple and yet a youth! It was His Father's house in a special
   sense because in the Temple did everything speak of God's Glory and
   everything there was meant for God's worship. It was His Father's
   house, too, in the sense that there His Father's work went on. If it
   had not been for the sin which had turned aside the Rabbis and the
   priests from the faithful following of God, the Temple was the place
   out of which God's power went forth. "Out of Zion, the perfection of
   beauty, God has shined." There, too, His Father's Truth was proclaimed
   and His ordinances were celebrated. The Temple was the center of the
   great Husbandman's farm--it was the homestead from which all the
   workers went forth to till the fields of Christ's own Father!

   It was there, especially, to Him that His Father's name was taught. He
   speedily made His way away from the place of sacrifice to that of
   teaching--"sacrifice and offering You did not desire"--but away He went
   to the doctors. This thoughtful, spiritual Child wanted to know about
   everything sacred and so He took His place among the learners--and the
   teachers were astonished when this new, "Child of the Law," put to them
   questions which showed that He must have thought vastly more than any
   other person in the Temple! When these enquiries were answered, they
   were but the predecessors of a whole army of other questions, for He
   wanted to know more! They were amazed that such enquiries should come
   from a youthful mind. In return they put questions to the youth and He
   answered well, for He had a remarkable mind and His mother had taught
   Him the precious Word of God so that He had the Law and the Prophets at
   His fingertips. No doubt He quoted, in His answers, the sayings of
   Isaiah or of Jeremiah and utterly astounded the doctors as they
   perceived that He saw deep into the Holy Words.

   Now, to be practical again, dear Friends, where should be our home as
   God's children but in our Father's house? Do you think we have enough
   of the child spirit about us to feel this? "Know you not that I must be
   in my Father's house?" That house is His Church. Among the faithful He
   dwells. The saints of God are built together for a habitation of God
   through the Spirit. Let me be often among His people, for I must be in
   my Father's house! Ought I not, must I not, shall I not, if I am,
   indeed, a child of God, love to be where God is worshipped? Will not
   the hymns of God's house charm me? Will not the prayers of God's people
   delight me? Shall I not be eager to be at the Prayer Meetings of the
   saints? Shall I not rejoice to join in their praise? Will not my soul
   be delighted to be at the Table of communion and everywhere else where
   God has appointed to be worshipped by His saints?

   Shall I not love every place where God's work is going on? If I hear
   the Gospel preached, shall I not say, "Let me be there"? If there is
   tract distribution from house to house, shall I not say, "I, too, will
   take a district if I can"? If there is Sunday School work, shall I not
   cry, "Let me have a class according to my ability! Let me take a share
   in this holy enterprise"? "Know you not that I must be at my Father's?
   In my Father's work and in my Father's house engaged in all my Father's
   concerns?" Should not this compulsion, blessed and sweet and
   irresistible, continually be upon us? I must be where God is! If I am
   not with His people because I am detained by sickness, yet I must be in
   my Father's house! There are many mansions in that great house on earth
   as well as in Heaven--and we can be with God in the streets and in His
   house when working in the fields! But we must be in our Father's
   house--we cannot bear to be away from God. Loss of communion is loss of
   peace, loss of delight.

   Oh, crave fellowship with God! Be covetous of it! Love everything that
   keeps you init! Hate everything that leads you from it! Rise early to
   commune with God, before the smoke of earth obscures the face of
   Heaven. Sit up late to commune with God while dews are falling all
   around. If you can do nothing else, deny yourself rest and wake in the
   night to commune with God your Father! Shall not a child love to speak
   with his Father and hear his Father speak to him? It must be so! It
   will be so! It cannot help being so with you if you feel the
   child-spirit strong within you as our blessed Lord and Master did when
   but 12 years of age!

   III. Consider, thirdly, THE HOLY CHILD'S OCCUPATION. Although I object
   to its being the correct reading,

   "Know you not that I must be about My Father's business?"--yet we know
   that this Holy Child would not be in His

   Father's house as an idler. He would be sure to be in the Father's
   house in the sense of being one of the workers in it. Our Father's
   house is a business house and, therefore, we must be in our Father's
   business when we are at our Father's! That is the word. Though the
   translation which mentions business may be a questionable one, yet it
   is abundantly lawful to say that this Holy Child's occupation was to be
   about His Father's matters.

   What, then, did He do? First, He spent His time in learning and
   enquiring. "How I pant to be doing good" says some young man. You are
   right, but you must not be impatient. Go among the teachers and learn a
   bit. You cannot teach yet, for you do not know--go and learn before you
   think of teaching! Hot spirits think that they are not serving God when
   they are learning, but in this they err. Beloved, Mary at Jesus' feet
   was commended rather than Martha, cumbered with much service! "But,"
   says one, "we ought not to be always hearing sermons." No, I do not
   know that any of you are. "We ought to get to work at once," cries
   another! Certainly you ought, after you have first learned what the
   work is! If everybody that is converted begins to teach, we shall soon
   have a mess of heresies and many raw and undigested dogmas taught which
   will rather do damage than good!

   Run, messenger, run! The King's business requires haste! No, rather
   pause a little. Have you any tidings to tell? First learn your message
   and then run as fast as you please. There must be time for learning the
   message. If our blessed Lord waited 30 years, He is an example to eager
   persons who can scarcely wait 30 minutes! See how fast light things
   will travel! How eager are those to speak who know nothing! How swift
   to speak what they do not know and to testify what they have never
   seen! This comes not of wisdom, but is the untimely fruit of folly. I
   have heard it said that Dissenters do not go to their chapels for
   worship, but for hearing sermons. It is not true! But if it were, I beg
   to say that hearing sermons may be one of the most God-pleasing forms
   of worship out of Heaven, for in hearing the Gospel as it should be
   heard, every sacred passion is brought into play and every power of our
   renewed manhood is made to bow before the Majesty on high!

   Faith by embracing the Promise, love by rejoicing in it, hope by
   expecting its fulfillment--all are worship when the theme is some
   gracious Word of the Most High! Thought, memory, understanding, emotion
   are all exercised. I do not know that I have ever worshipped God better
   than when I have heard a humble, simple-minded man tell out the story
   of the Cross and of his own conversion. With the tears running down my
   eyes I have heard the Gospel and adored the living God who has sent it
   among men! I have so seldom the privilege of hearing a sermon that when
   I do, it occasions an intense delight which I can scarcely describe--I
   then draw nearer to God than in any other exercise! I suppose it is so
   with you--at any rate, it would be so if the preaching were what it
   ought to be. True preaching begets worship.

   This Holy Child was about His Father's business when He was simply
   asking questions and learning of the appointed teachers. In fact, we
   need to do more of this kind of business. We are meager, lean and weak,
   because we are frothing at the mouth with talking too much before we
   have drank in the Truth of God into our inmost souls. Remember, the
   good matter cannot come out of you if it has never gone into you--and
   if you have no time for receiving instruction, the matter which comes
   out of you will be of little worth. This Holy Child is about His
   Father's business, for He is engrossed in it. His whole heart is in the
   hearing and asking questions. There is a force, to my mind, in the
   Greek, which is lost in the translation, which drags in the word,
   "about." There is nothing parallel to it in the Greek, which is, "Know
   you not that I must be in my Father's?" The way to worship God is to
   get heartily into it. "Blessed is the man whose strength is in You; in
   whose heart are Your ways."

   We say, sometimes, when preaching, "I felt that I got fairly into the
   subject," and you, yourselves, know when the preacher is really getting
   into it. Often he is paddling about on the shore of his text and
   possibly he wades into it up to his ankles. But, oh, when he plunges
   into the "rivers to swim in," then you have grand times! When the
   precious Truth of God has fairly carried him off his feet, you take a
   header, too, and swim likewise. Our Lord, when He went into the Temple,
   became engrossed with its worship and teaching--and that was His answer
   to Mary! He did as good as say, "Know you not that I was absorbed in My
   Father's? I did not know you were gone. I forgot all about you. Know
   you not that My soul was in My Father's? I was so taken up with what I
   was learning from the doctors and what I was seeing in the Temple that
   I could not but remain. Did you not know that? Did you not also become
   absorbed?"

   He seems to think they might have been as interested as He and they
   would have been if they bad borne the same relation to God as He did!
   It is natural that we should become engrossed in our worship. I should
   not wonder if, sometimes, we were a little rude to those who sat next
   to us, or moved about a little more than etiquette would suggest; or
   vented

   our feelings in involuntary expressions and became troublesome to those
   next us in the pews, so that they said, "What can be the matter with
   these people?" Friends, we have got into the holy engagement and we
   cannot quite govern ourselves! And we feel as if we could say to you,
   "Know you not that I must be in my Father's work, worship and Truth?"
   We cannot be half-hearted! We are too happy for that. We are carried
   clean away. Do you not know that we cannot be proper and calm, for we
   must be all taken up with our holy service"?

   Besides, the Holy Child declares that He was under a necessity to be in
   it. "Know you not that I must be in My Father's?" He could not help
   Himself! Christ could never be a half-hearted pupil or a lukewarm
   worshipper. It was not possible for Him to be that! He must get
   absorbed in it; drawn right into the blessed whirlpool--He must be lost
   in it and give His whole thought and attention to it--and He tells His
   mother so. "Know you not that I must be about My Father's business?"
   Other things did not interest the Holy Child--but this thing absorbed
   Him. You know the story of Alexander, that when the Persian ambassadors
   came to his father's court, little Alexander asked them many questions,
   but they were not at all such as boys generally think of.

   He did not ask them to describe to him the throne of ivory, nor the
   hanging gardens of Babylon, nor anything as to the gorgeous apparel of
   the king. He asked what weapons the Persians used in battle; in what
   form they marched and how far it was to their country, for the boy
   Alexander felt the man Alexander within him and he had presentiments
   that he was the man who would conquer Persia and show them another way
   of fighting that would make them turn their backs before him! It is a
   singular parallel to the case of the Child, Jesus, who is taken up with
   nothing but what is His Father's because it was for Him to do His
   Father's work and to live for His Father's Glory--and to execute His
   Father's purpose even to the last.

   IV. Let us, lastly, learn THIS HOLY CHILD'S SPECIAL LESSON TO THOSE OF
   US WHO ARE SEEKERS. Do I address any children of God who have lost
   sight of Christ? It does happen at times that we miss the Holy Child
   and it happens most often when we are happy in company and so are taken
   off from Him. Mary and Joseph were, no doubt, delighted with the
   festival and so they forgot Jesus. You and I, when in God's house, may
   forget the Lord of the House. Did you ever lose Him at His own Table?
   Did you ever lose Him while engaged in His work? Have you ever missed
   Him even while you were busy with holy things? When you do, perhaps you
   will say to Him, "Lord, I have sought You long; I have been among Your
   kinsfolk; I have been to dear saints of God and spoken to them and have
   said, 'Have you seen Him whom my soul loves, for I have lost Him?'"

   His answer is, "Why have you sought Me?" He is not lost to those who
   long for Him! Cannot you trust Him when He is away? He is all right
   even when you see Him not! Though He does not always smile, He loves us
   to the end. If you are not walking in the light of His Countenance, yet
   you are living in the love of His heart. Jesus sees you when you do not
   see Him--He has reasons for hiding Himself which are founded in wisdom.
   Mark, dearly beloved ones, if you and I need to find our Lord, we know
   where He is. Do we not? He is at His Father's. Let us go unto His
   Father's--let us go to our Father and His Father and let us speak with
   God and ask Him where Jesus is if we have lost His company. We may be
   sure that He is in His Father's work. We are sure of that.

   Let us go to work for Him again. Do not let us say, "I feel so dull I
   cannot pray." Now is the time in which we must pray. "But I do not feel
   as if I could praise Him." Now is the time when you must praise Him and
   the praise will come while you are praising. At times we have no heart
   for holy exercises and the devil says, "Do not go." My dear Friend, be
   sure to go up to the assembly--go to get the heart for going! Have you
   begun not to care about Prayer Meetings? Are you going to stay away
   till you do care about them? Then you will die in indifference! Come
   and have another turn at them. Those who are most at them, love them
   best. Does Satan say, with regard to private prayer, "You have not the
   spirit of prayer. You must not pray"? Tell the devil you are going to
   pray for the spirit of prayer and that you will plead till you get it!
   It is a sign of sickness when you cannot pray and surely, then, you
   should go to the Physician.

   If there is ever a time when a man should pray more than usual, it is
   when he feels dead and cold in the holy engagement--go and seek Jesus
   at the Father's and seek Him in the Father's work--and those of you who
   have lost communion with Him will find it again. When you take the
   Sunday school class, again, that you left because you said you had had
   enough of it. When you go again and preach at the street corner--you
   have not done that lately. When you begin, again, to be active in the
   Lord's service, then you will again meet with this Blessed One who is
   about His Father's business, whether you are or not!

   One more word and that is to sinners who are seeking Christ. I would
   not say a word to discourage any who are seeking Jesus, but I should
   like to get them far beyond the stage of seeking. Perhaps the Holy
   Spirit will help them to do so if I read Christ's words to them. "How
   is it that you sought ME?" Dear, dear! That is, indeed, a turning of
   things upside down! Our Lord Jesus has come into the world to seek and
   to save the lost--is it not an odd thing when those who are lost get to
   seeking Him? That is a reversal of all order! "How is it," He says,
   "that you sought Me?" Now, if I, this morning, am a poor, lost sinner
   and can honestly say I am seeking Christ, there must be some blunder
   somewhere! How can this be? How shall I make heads or tails of it? Here
   is a sheep seeking the shepherd! A lost piece of silver seeking its
   owner! How can this be?

   It will all come right if you will just think of this--first, that
   Jesus Christ is not far away. He is in the Father's house. "Where is
   the Father's house?" Why, all around us! The great Father's house
   covers the whole world and all the stars! He lives everywhere! He
   dwells not in temples made with hands, like this Tabernacle, or yon
   cathedral--the Lord God is outside in the fields, in the
   streets--wherever you seek Him. Say not, Who shall climb to Heaven to
   find, Him, or dive into the deeps to bring Him up? "The Word is near
   you." Here is Christ in the midst of us! What are you looking for, man?
   Are you seeking for some spirit of the night, or specter of darkness?
   Jesus is near! Believe in Him!

   Remember another thing, that Christ must be about His Father's
   business. And what is His Father's business? Why, to save sinners! This
   is His great Father's delight. He is glad to bring His prodigals home.
   Are you seeking Jesus as if He could not be found, as if it were hard
   to make Him hear and difficult to win His help? Why, He is busy in
   saving sinners! Jesus sits on Zion's hill--He still receives poor
   sinners! Be encouraged and do not go about among your kinsfolk seeking
   Him, nor with bitter tears and cries of despair look for Him as if He
   were hiding from you! He is not far from any one of us. He stands
   before you and He bids you trust Him! Look to Him and be saved! Do you
   look? You are saved! Go on your way rejoicing! God bless you. Amen.

                             Love and I' A Mystery

   A Sermon

   (No. 1667)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, July 2nd, 1882, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love
   wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.'John 17:26.

   FOR SEVERAL SABBATH MORNINGS my mind has been directed into subjects
   which I might fitly call the deep things of God. I think I have never
   felt my own incompetence more fully than in trying to handle such
   subjects. It is a soil into which one may dig and dig as deep as ever
   you will, and still never exhaust the golden nuggets which lie within
   it. I am, however, comforted by this fact, that these subjects are so
   fruitful that even we who can only scratch the surface of them shall
   yet get a harvest from them. I read once of the plains of India, that
   they were so fertile that you had only to tickle them with a hoe and
   they laughed with plenty, and surely such a text as this may be
   described as equally fruitful, even under our feeble husbandry. Pearls
   lie on the surface here as well as in the depth. We have only to search
   its surface, and stir the soil a little, and we shall be astonished at
   the plenitude of spiritual wealth which lies before us. Oh, that the
   Spirit of God may help us to enjoy the blessed truths which are herein
   set forth! Here is the priceless treasure, but it lies hid till he
   reveals it to us.

   You see, this text is taken out of our Lord's last prayer with his
   disciples. He did as good as say, I am about to leave you, I am about
   to die for you; and for a while you will not see me; but now, before we
   separate, let us pray.' It is one of those impulses that you have felt
   yourselves. When you have been about to part from those you love, to
   leave them perhaps in danger and difficulty, you have felt you could do
   no less than say, Let us draw nigh unto God.' Your heart found no way
   of expressing itself at all so fitting, so congenial, so satisfactory
   as to draw near unto the great Father and spread the case before him.
   Now, a prayer from such a one as Jesus, our Lord and Master; a prayer
   in such a company, with the eleven whom he had chosen, and who had
   consorted with him from the beginning; a prayer under such
   circumstances, when he was just on the brink of the brook of Cedron,
   and was about to cross that gloomy stream and go up to Calvary, and
   there lay down his life'such a prayer as this, so living, earnest,
   loving and divine, deserves the most studious meditations of all
   believers. I invite you to bring hither your best thoughts and skill
   for the navigation of this sea. It is not a creek or bay, but the main
   ocean itself. We cannot hope to fathom its depths. This is true of any
   sentence of this matchless prayer; but for me the work of exposition
   becomes unusually heavy, because my text is the close and climax of
   this marvellous supplication: it is the central mystery of all. In the
   lowest depth there is still a lower deep, and this verse is one of
   those deeps which still exceed the rest. Oh, how much we want the
   Spirit of God. Pray for his bedewing: pray that his balmy influences
   may descend upon us richly now.

   You will observe that the last word of our Lord's prayer is concerning
   love. This is the last petition which he offers, That the love
   wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.' He reaches
   no greater height than this, namely, that his people be filled with the
   Father's love. How could he rise higher? For this is to be filled with
   all the fulness of God, since God is love, and he that loveth dwelleth
   in God and God in him. What importance ought you and I to attach to the
   grace of love! How highly we should esteem that which Jesus makes the
   crown jewel of all. If we have faith, let us not be satisfied unless
   our faith worketh by love and purifieth the soul. Let us not be content
   indeed until the love of Christ is shed abroad in our hearts by the
   Holy Ghost which is given unto us. Well did the poet say,

   Only love to us be given,

   Lord, we ask no other heaven;'

   for indeed there is no other heaven below, and scarcely is there any
   other heaven above than to reach to the fulness of perfect love. This
   is where the prayer of the Son of David ends, in praying that the love
   wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them.' What a subject! The
   highest that even our Lord Jesus reached in his noblest prayer. Again
   with groanings my heart cries, Holy Spirit, help.

   I shall this morning try to speak first upon the food of love, or what
   love lives upon; secondly, upon the love itself, what kind of love it
   is; and then, thirdly, upon the companion of love. That the love
   wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.'

   I. First, THE FOOD OF LOVE to God: what is it? It is knowledge. I have
   made known unto them thy name, and will make it known.' We cannot love
   a God whom we do not know: a measure of knowledge is needful to
   affection. However lovely God may be, a man blind of soul cannot
   perceive him, and therefore is not touched by his loveliness. Only when
   the eyes are opened to behold the loveliness of God will the heart go
   out towards God who is so desirable an object for the affections.
   Brethren, we must know in order to believe; we must know in order to
   hope; and we must especially know in order to love. Hence the great
   desirableness that you should know the Lord, and his great love which
   passeth knowledge. You cannot reciprocate love which you have never
   known, even as a man cannot derive strength from food which he has not
   eaten. Till first of all the love of God has come into your heart, and
   you have been made a partaker of it, you cannot rejoice in it or return
   it. Therefore our Lord took care to feed his disciples' hearts upon the
   Father's name. He laboured to make the Father known to them. This is
   one of his great efforts with them, and he is grieved when he sees
   their ignorance, and has to say to one of them, Have I been so long
   time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath
   seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the
   Father?' Study much, then, the word of God: be diligent in turning the
   pages of Scripture and in hearing God's true ministers, that the flame
   of love within your hearts may be revived by the fuel of holy knowledge
   which you place upon it. Pile on the logs of sandal wood, and let the
   perfumed fires burn before the Lord. Heap on the handfuls of
   frankincense and sweet odours of sacred knowledge, that on the altar of
   your heart there may always be burning the sacred flame of love to God
   in Christ Jesus.

   The knowledge here spoken of is a knowledge which Jesus gave them. I
   have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And I
   have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it.' O beloved, it
   is not knowledge that you and I pick up as a matter of book learning
   that will ever bring out our love to the Father: it is knowledge given
   us by Christ through his Spirit. It is not knowledge communicated by
   the preacher alone which will bless you; for however much he may be
   taught of God himself, he cannot preach to the heart unless the blessed
   Spirit of God comes and takes of the things that are spoken, and
   reveals them and makes them manifest to each individual heart, so that
   in consequence it knows the Lord. Jesus said, O righteous Father, the
   world hath not known thee,' and you and I would have been in the same
   condition, strangers to God, without God and without hope in the world,
   if the Spirit of God had not taken of divine things and applied them to
   our souls so that we are made to know them. Every living word of
   knowledge is the work of the living God. If you only know what you have
   found out for yourself, or picked up by your own industry apart from
   Jesus, you know nothing aright: it must be by the direct and distinct
   teaching of God the Holy Ghost that you must learn to profit. Jesus
   Christ alone can reveal the Father. He himself said, No man cometh unto
   the Father but by me.' He that knows not Christ knows not the Father;
   but when Jesus Christ reveals him, ah! then we do know him after a
   special, personal, peculiar, inward knowledge. This knowledge brings
   with it a life and a love with which the soul is not puffed up, but
   built up. By such knowledge we grow up into him in all things who is
   our head, being taught of the Son of God.

   This knowledge, dear friends, comes to us gradually. The text indicates
   this. I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it.' As if,
   though they knew the Father, there was far more to know and the Lord
   Jesus was resolved to teach them more. Are you growing in knowledge, my
   brothers and sisters? My labour is lost if you are not growing in grace
   and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I hope you
   know much more of God than you did twenty years ago when first you came
   to him. That little knowledge which you received by grace when you
   found life in a look at the Crucified One' has saved you; but in these
   after years you have added to your faith knowledge, and to your
   knowledge experience; you have gone on to know more deeply what you
   knew before, and to know the details of what you seemed to know in the
   gross and the lump at first. You have come to look into things as well
   as upon things'a look at Christ saves; but oh, it is the look into
   Christ that wins the heart's love and holds it fast and binds us to him
   as with fetters of gold. We ought every day to be adding something to
   this inestimably precious store, that as we are known of God so we may
   know God, and become thereby transformed from glory unto glory through
   his Spirit.

   Are you not thankful for this blessed word of the Lord Jesus: I will
   declare it': I will make it known'? He did do so at his resurrection,
   when he taught his people things they knew not before; but he did so
   much more after he had ascended up on high when the Spirit of God was
   given. He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
   remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.' And now to-day in the
   hearts of his people he is daily teaching us something that we do not
   know. All our experience tends that way. When the Spirit of God blesses
   an affliction to us, it is one of the Saviour's illuminated books out
   of which we learn something more of the Father's name, and consequently
   come to love him better: for that is the thing Christ aims at. He would
   so make known the Father, that the love wherewith the Father hath loved
   him may be in us, and that he himself may be in us.

   This knowledge distinguishes us from the world. It is the mark by which
   the elect are made manifest. In the sixth verse of this chapter our
   Lord says: I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
   out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they
   have kept thy word.' The world does not know the Father, and cannot
   know him, for it abides in the darkness and death of sin. Judge
   yourselves therefore by this sure test, and let the love which grows
   out of gracious knowledge be a token for good unto you.

   Now let me try to show you what the Saviour meant when he said, I have
   declared unto them thy name, and will declare.' This knowledge which
   breeds love is knowledge of the name of God. What does he mean by Thy
   name.' Now, I do not think I should preach an unprofitable sermon if I
   were to stop with the connection and say that the name' here meant is
   specially the name used in the twenty-fifth verse: O righteous Father,
   the world hath not known thee.' This is the name which we most need to
   know'righteous Father.' Observe the singular combination. Righteous and
   yet a Father. Righteous': to us poor sinners that is a word of terror
   when first we hear it. Father,'oh, how sweet. That is a word of good
   cheer even to us prodigals; but we are afraid to lay hold upon it, for
   our sins arise, and conscience protests that God must be righteous, and
   punish sin. Our joy begins when we see the two united: righteous
   Father,'a Father full of love, and nothing but love, to his people, and
   yet righteous as a Judge, as righteous as if he were no Father. Dealing
   out his righteousness with stern severity as the Judge of all the earth
   must do, and yet a Father at the same time. I do protest that I never
   did love God at all, nor could I embrace him in my affections, till I
   understood how he could be just and yet the justifier of him that
   believeth in Jesus: how, in a word, he could be the righteous Father.'
   That satisfied my conscience and my heart at the same time, for my
   conscience said, It is well. God hath not put away sin without a
   sacrifice, and hath not winked at sin nor waived his justice in order
   to indulge his mercy, but he remains just as he ever was'the same
   thrice holy God who will by no means spare the guilty. He hath laid the
   punishment of our sins upon Christ; he hath made him to be sin for us,
   who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
   And all this he has done that he might act to us as a Father, and save
   his own children from the result of their transgressions. He has given
   his only begotten Son to die in our stead that many sons might be
   brought to glory through him. It is at the cross we understand this
   riddle. Here we see the righteous Father. But the world will not learn
   it, and a large part of the professing church, which is nothing better
   than the world wrongfully named with Christ's name, will not learn it.
   They do anything they can to get away from atonement: love without
   righteousness is their idol. Substitution is a word that is hard for
   the world to spell: they cannot abide it. That Christ should suffer in
   the stead of the guilty, and bear that we might never bear the Father's
   righteous wrath,'this they cannot away with. Many pretend to keep the
   atonement, and yet they tear the bowels out of it. They profess to
   believe in the gospel, but it is a gospel without the blood of the
   atonement; and a bloodless gospel is a lifeless gospel, a dead gospel,
   and a damning gospel. Let those take heed who cannot see God as a
   righteous Father, for they are numbered amongst the world who know him
   not. These have known thee,' saith our Lord. These who have been taught
   by Christ, and these alone, come to find as much joy in the word
   righteous' as in the word Father'; and blending the two together they
   feel an intense love to the righteous Father,' and their hearts rejoice
   in a holy gospel, a message of mercy consistent with justice, a
   covenant salvation ordered in all things and sure, because it does no
   violence to law and does not bind the hands of justice. Beloved, if
   this revelation of the atoning blood does not make your heart love
   Jesus, and love the Father, it is because you are not in him; but if
   you know this secret as to how righteousness and peace have kissed each
   other, you know the name that wins the affection of believers to God.
   My own heart is glad and rejoices every hour because I find rest in
   substitution, safety in the vindication of the law, and bliss in the
   glory of the divine character.

   Lo! In the grace that rescued man

   His brightest form of glory shines!

   Here, on the cross, tis fairest drawn

   In precious blood and crimson lines.

   Here I behold his inmost heart,

   Where grace and vengeance strangely join,

   Piercing his Son with sharpest smart,

   To make the purchased pleasure mine.

   Oh, the sweet wonders of that cross,

   Where God the Saviour loved and died!

   Her noblest life my spirit draws

   From his dear wounds and bleeding sides.'

   Still, I would take the word name' in a wider sense. I have declared
   unto them thy name,' which signifies thy character.' The word name' is
   used as a sort of summary of all the attributes of God. All these
   attributes are well adapted to win the love of all regenerate spirits.
   Just think for a minute. God is holy. To a holy mind there is nothing
   in the world, there is nothing in heaven more beautiful than holiness.
   We read of the beauties of holiness; for to a soul that is purified,
   holiness is superlatively lovely. Now, beauty wins love, and
   consequently when Jesus Christ makes known his holy Father, and shows
   us in his life and in his death the holiness of the Ever-blessed, then
   our heart is won to the Father. Oh,' say you, but holiness does not
   always win love.' No, not the love of the defiled hearts that cannot
   appreciate it; but those who are pure in heart, and can see God, no
   sooner behold his holiness than they are enamoured of it, and their
   souls at once delight in their Lord.

   Moreover, we learn from our Lord Jesus that God is good. There is none
   good but one: that is God.' How inexpressibly good he is! There is no
   goodness but what comes from God. His name, God' is but short for
   good,' and all the good things that we receive in this life, and for
   the life to come, are but enlargements of his blessed name. Every good
   gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the
   Father of lights.' Blessings enjoyed by us are streams that flow from
   the fountain head of God's infinite goodness to the sons of men. A man
   cannot help loving God when once he knows him to be good, for all men
   love that which they apprehend to be good to them. A man says, Gold is
   good; rest is good; fame is good;' and therefore he seeks after these
   things, and when he comes to know that God is good, oh, then his spirit
   follows hard after him. He cannot help but love that which he is
   persuaded is in the highest sense good. The soul that knows the name of
   the Lord rejoices at the very mention of him.

   To sinners like ourselves perhaps the next word may have more
   sweetness. God is merciful; he is ever ready to forgive. Note how the
   prophet saith,'Who is a God like unto thee, passing by transgression?'
   He does not say, Who is a man like unto thee?' for none among our race
   can for a moment be compared with him; but even if the gods of the
   heathen were gods, none of them could be likened unto the Lord for
   mercy. Now, when a man knows that he has offended, and yet the person
   offended readily and freely forgives, why, it wins his love. If he is a
   right-hearted man he cries, I cannot again offend one who so generously
   casts all my offences behind his back.' The mercy of God is such a
   love-winning attribute that, as I told you the other Sunday, twenty-six
   times in a single psalm the ancient church sang, His mercy endureth for
   ever.' Free grace and pardoning love sensibly known in the soul will
   win your hearts unto God for ever, so that you shall be his willing
   servants as long as you have any being.

   But then there is a higher word still. God is love, and there is a
   something about love which always wins love. When love puts on her own
   golden armour, and bares her sword bright with her own unselfishness,
   she goeth on conquering and to conquer. Let a man once apprehend that
   God is love, that this is God's very essence, and he must at once love
   God. I do not mean merely apprehend' that God is love in the cold
   intellect; but when this heart begins to glow and burn with that divine
   revelation, then straightway the spirit is joined unto the Lord, and
   rests with delight in the great Father of spirits. Love knits and
   binds. Oh to feel more of its uniting power.

   Thus have I shown you the manna which love feeds upon, the nectar which
   it drinks. Everything in God is lovely, and there is no trait in his
   character that is otherwise than lovely. All the lovelinesses that can
   be conceived are heaped up in God without the slightest admixture or
   adulteration. He is love altogether, wholly, and emphatically. Oh,
   surely our Lord and Master was wise when he fed his people's love upon
   such meat as this.

   II. Brethren, we have as yet only been standing at the furnace mouth:
   let us now enter into the devouring flame while we speak, in the second
   place, upon THE LOVE ITSELF.

   Observe, first, what this love is not. I have declared unto them thy
   name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me
   may be in them.' Do notice that the prayer is not that the Father's
   love may be set upon them, or moved towards them. God does not love us
   because we know him, for he loved us before we knew him, even as Paul
   speaks of His great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead
   in trespasses and sins.' Jesus has not come to set his Father's love
   upon the chosen. Oh, no; he did not even die with that object, for the
   Father's love was upon the chosen from everlasting. The Father himself
   loveth you' was always true. Christ did not die to make his Father
   loving, but because his Father is loving: the atoning blood is the
   outflow of the very heart of God toward us. So do not make any mistake.
   Our Lord speaks not of the divine love in itself, but in us. This is
   not the eternal love of God towards us of which we are now reading, but
   that love in us. We are inwardly to feel the love which proceeds from
   the Father, and so to have it in us. We are to have the love of God
   shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. It
   is to be recognized by us, felt in us, made the subject of inward joy;
   this it is that our Lord wishes to produce, that the love of God may be
   in us, dwelling in our hearts, a welcome guest, the sovereign of our
   souls.

   And this love is of a very peculiar sort. Do let me read the verse
   again: That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them.' It
   is God's own love in us. The love of the Father towards Jesus springs
   up like a crystal fountain, and then the sparkling drops fall and
   overflow, as you have seen the fountains do, and we are the cups into
   which this overflowing love of God towards Christ Jesus flows, and
   flows till we too are full. The inward love so much desired for us by
   our Lord is no emotion of nature, no attachment proceeding from the
   unregenerate will, but it is the Father's love transplanted into the
   soil of these poor hearts, and becoming our love to Jesus, as we shall
   have to show in the next point. But is not this a wonderful thing,'that
   God's own love to Jesus should dwell in our hearts? And yet it is so.
   The love wherewith we love Christ, mark you, is God's love to Christ:
   That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them. All true
   love, such as the Father delights in and accepts at our hands, is
   nothing but his own love, which has come streaming down from his own
   heart into our renewed minds.

   But what can this mean? I must ask you to observe that it includes
   within itself four precious things.

   First, the text means that our Lord Jesus Christ desires us to have a
   distinct recognition of the Father's love to him. He wants the love
   wherewith the Father loves him to be felt in us, so that we may say,
   Yes, I know the Father loved him, for I, who am such a poor, unworthy,
   and foolish creature, yet love him; and, oh, how his Father must love
   him.' I love him! Ay, by his grace, it were a blessed thing to die for
   him; but if I love him, oh, how must his Father love him who can see
   all his beauty, and can appreciate every distinct piece of loveliness
   that is in him! God never loved anything as he loves Christ, except his
   people, and they have had to be lifted up to that position by the love
   which the Father has to his Son. For, first and foremost, the Father
   and the Son are one: they are one in essence. The Saviour has been with
   the Father from the beginning, and his delight has been with him, even
   as the Father testified, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased.' Oh, do try to feel, if you can, the love of the Father to his
   Son, or else you will not love the Father as you should for the amazing
   sacrifice which he made in giving Jesus to us. Think what it cost him
   to tear his Well-Beloved from his bosom and send him down below to be
   despised and rejected.' Think what it cost him to nail him up to yonder
   cross, and then forsake him and hide his face from him, because he had
   laid all our sins upon him. Oh, the love he must have had to us thus to
   have made his best Beloved to become a curse for us, as it is written,
   Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.' I want you to get this
   right into your souls, dear friends. Do not hold it as a dry doctrine,
   but let it touch your heart. Let it flow into your heart like a boiling
   stream, till your whole souls become like Icelandic geysers, which boil
   and bubble up and send their steam aloft into the clouds. Oh, to have
   the soul filled with the love of the Father towards him who is
   altogether lovely.

   Now, go a step further and deeper. Our text bears a further reading.
   Remember that you are to have in your heart a sense of the Father's
   love to you, and to recollect that it is precisely the same love
   wherewith he loves his Son. That the love wherewith thou hast loved me
   may be in them.' Oh, wonder of wonders, I feel more inclined to sit
   down and meditate upon it than to stand up and talk about it! The love
   wherewith he loved his Son'such is his love to all his chosen ones. Can
   you believe it, that you should be the object of God's delight, even as
   Christ is, because you are in Christ; that you should be the object of
   the Father's love as truly as Christ is, because he sees you to be part
   and parcel of the mystical body of his well-beloved Son? Do not tell me
   that God the Father does not love you as well as he does Christ: the
   point can be settled by the grandest matter of fact that ever was. When
   there was a choice between Christ and his people which should die of
   the two, the Father freely delivered up his own Son that we might live
   through him. Oh, what a meeting there must have been of the seas of
   love that day, when God's great love to us came rolling in like a
   glorious springtide, and his love to his Son came rolling in at the
   same time. If they had met and come into collision, we cannot imagine
   the result; but when they both took to rolling together in one mighty
   torrent, what a stream of love was there! The Lord Jesus sank that we
   might swim, he sank that we might rise; and now we are borne onward for
   ever by the mighty sweep of infinite love into an everlasting
   blessedness which tongues and lips can never fully set forth. Oh, be
   ravished with this. Be carried away with it; be in ecstasy at love so
   amazing, so divine: the Father loves you even as he loves his Son;
   after the same manner and sort he loveth all his redeemed.

   But now this goes to a third meaning, and that is that we are to give
   back a reflection of this love, and to love Jesus as the Father loves
   him. A dear old friend speaking to me the other day in a rapturous tone
   said, I love Jesus as the Father loves him.' This is true; not equally,
   but like. Is not this a blessed thought? I said, O friend, that is a
   strong thing to say!' Ah,' said he, but not stronger than Jesus would
   have it when he prays that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be
   in them, and I in them.' His people love Christ as the Father loves
   him,'in the same way, though from want of capacity they cannot reach to
   the same immeasurable force of love. Oh, to throw back on Christ his
   Father's love. The Father is the sun and we are the moon, but the
   moonlight is the same light as the sunlight. We can see a difference
   because reflection robs the light of much of its heat and its
   brilliance, but it is the same light. The moon has not a ray of light
   but what came from the sun, and we have not a live coal of love to
   Christ but what came from the Father. We are as the moon, shining by
   reflected light, but Jesus loves the moonlight of our love and rejoices
   in it. Let us give him all of it: let us try to be as the full moon
   always, and let us not dwindle down to a mere ring of love, or a
   crescent of affection; let us render no half-moon love; let us not be
   half dark and cold, but let us shine on Christ with all the light we
   can possibly reflect of his father's love, saying in our very soul,

   My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;

   For thee all the follies of sin I resign.'

   And then fourthly, this love of the Father in us is to go beaming forth
   from us to all around. When we get the love wherewith the Father loves
   the Son into our hearts, then it is to go out towards all the chosen
   seed. He that loveth him that begat loveth also them that are begotten
   of him. Ay, and your love is to go forth to all the sons of men,
   seeking their good for God's glory, that they may be brought in to know
   the same Saviour in whom we rejoice. Oh, if the love of the Father to
   Christ once enters into a man's soul it will change him; it will sway
   him with the noblest passion; it will make him a zealot for Christ; it
   will cast out his selfishness; it will change him into the image of
   Christ, and fit him to dwell in heaven where love is perfected.

   So I conclude this second head by saying that this indwelling of the
   Father's love in us has the most blessed results. It has an expulsive
   result. As soon as ever it gets into the heart it says to all love of
   sin, Get thee hence; there remains no room for thee here.' When the
   light enters in, the darkness receives immediate notice of ejectment;
   the night is gone as soon as the dawn appears. It has also a repulsive
   power by which it repels the assaults of sin. As though a man did
   snatch the sun out of the heaven and make a round shield with it, and
   hold it in the very face of the prince of darkness, and blind him with
   the light, so doth the love of God the Father repel the enemy. It girds
   the soul with the armour of light. It repels the devil, the love of the
   world, the love of sin, and all outward temptations. And then what an
   impulsive power it has. Get the love of Christ into you, and it is as
   when an engine receives fire and steam, and so obtains the force which
   drives it. Then have you strengthening, then have you motive power,
   then are you urged on to this and that heroic deed which, apart from
   this sublime love, you never would have thought of. For Christ you can
   live, for Christ you can suffer, for Christ you can die, when once the
   Father's love to him has taken full possession of your spirit. And, oh,
   how elevating it is. How it lifts a man up above self and sin; how it
   makes him seek the things that are above! How purifying it is; and how
   happy it makes the subject of its influence. If you are unhappy you
   want more of the love of God. Oh,' say you, I want a larger income.'
   Nonsense. A man is not made happy by money. You will do very well in
   poverty if you have enough of the love of God. Oh, but if your soul be
   filled with the love of God, your spirit will be ready to dance at the
   very sound of his name. You murmur and repine at providence because the
   fire of your love is burning low. Come, get the ashes together; pray
   the Spirit of God to blow upon them: beg him to bring fresh fuel of
   holy knowledge, till your soul becomes like Nebuchadnezzar's furnace,
   heated seven times hotter. This is the kind of love we should have
   towards Christ. No blessing can excel it. Oh, Saviour, let thy prayer
   be fulfilled in me and in all thy dear people this morning, and may the
   love wherewith the Father hath loved thee be in us.

   III. Thirdly, here is THE COMPANION OF LOVE. I in them.' Look the text
   a minute and just catch those two words. Here is love' and I'love and
   Christ come together. Oh, blessed guests! Love and I,' says Christ; as
   if he felt he never had a companion that suited him better. Love' and
   I': Jesus is ever at home where love is reigning. When love lives in
   his people's hearts, Jesus lives there too. Does Jesus, then, live in
   the hearts of his people? Yes; wherever there is the love of the Father
   shed abroad in them, he must be there. We have his own word for it, and
   we are sure that Jesus knows where he is.

   We are sure that he is where love is; for, first, where there is love
   there is life, and where there is life there is Christ, for he himself
   says, I am the life.' There is no true life in the believer's soul that
   is divided from Christ. We are sure of that; so that where there is
   love there is life, and where there is life there is Christ. Again,
   where there is the love of God in the heart there is the Holy Spirit;
   but wherever the Holy Spirit is, there is Christ, for the Holy Spirit
   is Christ's representative; and it is in that sense that he tells us,
   Lo, I am with you alway,' namely, because the Spirit is come to be
   always with us. So where there is love there is the Spirit of God, and
   where there is the Spirit of God there is Christ. So it is always Love
   and I.'

   Furthermore where there is love there is faith, for faith worketh by
   love, and there never was true love to Christ apart from faith; but
   where there is faith there is always Christ, for if there is faith in
   him he has been received into the soul. Jesus is ever near to that
   faith which has himself for its foundation and resting place. Where
   there is love there is faith, where there is faith there is Christ, and
   so it is love and I.'

   Ay, but where there is the Father's love toward Christ in the heart God
   himself is there. I am sure of that, for God is love. So if there is
   love within us there must be God, and where God is, there Christ is,
   for he saith, I and my Father are one.' So you see, where there is
   love, there must be Jesus Christ, for these reasons and for many others
   beside.

   I in them.' Yes, if I were commanded to preach for seven years from
   these three words only, I should never exhaust the text, I am quite
   certain. I might exhaust you by my dulness, and exhaust myself by
   labour to tell out the sacred secret, but I should never exhaust the
   text. I in them.' It is the most blessed word I know of. You, beloved,
   need not go abroad to find the Lord Jesus Christ. Where does he live?
   He lives within you. I in them.' As soon as ever you pray you are sure
   he hears you, because he is within you. He is not knocking at your
   door: he has entered into you, and there he dwells, and will go no more
   out for ever.

   What a blessed sense of power this gives to us. I in them.' Then it is
   no more I' in weakness, but, since Jesus dwells in me, I can do all
   things through Christ that strengtheneth me.' I in them.' It is the
   glory of the believer that Christ dwells in him. Unto you that believe
   he is precious.'

   Hence we gather the security of the believer. Brother, if Christ be in
   me, and I am overcome, Christ is conquered too, for he is in me. I in
   them.' I cannot comprehend the doctrine of believers falling from
   grace. If Christ has once entered into them, will he not abide with
   them? Paul saith, I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor
   angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
   to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.'
   To that persuasion I set my hand and seal. Well, then, if Christ is in
   us, whatever happens to us will happen to him. We shall be losers if we
   do not get to heaven; but so will he be, for he is in us, and so is a
   partaker of our condition. If it is an indissoluble union'and so he
   declares it is'I in them,' then his destiny and ours are linked
   together; and if he wins the victory we conquer in him: if he sits at
   the right hand of God we shall sit at the right hand of God with him,
   for he is in us.

   I know not what more to say, not because I have nothing more, but
   because I do not know which to bring forward out of a thousand precious
   things; but I leave the subject with you. Go home, and live in the
   power of this blessed text. Go home, and be as happy as you can be to
   live, and if you get a little happier that will not hurt you, for then
   you will be in heaven. Keep up unbroken joy in the Lord. It is not I in
   them' for Sundays, and away on Mondays; I in them' when they sit in the
   Tabernacle, and out of them when they reach home. No; I in them,' and
   that for ever and for ever. Go and rejoice. Show this blind world that
   you have a happiness which as much outshines theirs as the sun
   outshines the sparks which fly from the chimney and expire. Go forth
   with joy and be led forth with peace; let the mountains and the hills
   break forth before you into singing.

   All that remains for me

   Is but to love and sing,

   And wait until the angels come,

   To bear me to the King.'

   Oh, but I have my troubles.' I know you have your troubles, but they
   are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in
   you, nor even with your present glory. I feel as if I could not think
   about troubles, nor sins, nor anything else when I once behold the love
   of God to me. When I feel my love to Christ, which is but God's love to
   Christ, burning within my soul, then I glory in tribulation, for the
   power of God shall be through these afflictions made manifest in me. I
   in them.' God bless you with the knowledge of this mystery, for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

The Still Small Voice

   (No. 1668)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 9, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and
   after the fire a still small voice. So it was when Elijah heard it,
   that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the
   entrance of the ca ve. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and
   said, What are you doing here, Elijah?" 1 Kings 19:12,13.

   ELIJAH, no doubt, expected that after the wonderful display of God's
   power on Carmel the nation would give up its idols and would turn unto
   the only living and true God. Had they not confessed as with a voice of
   thunder, "Jehovah, He is the God! Jehovah, He is the God!"? The Prophet
   trusted that the heart of Ahab might, perhaps, be touched and possibly,
   through him, the heart of Jezebel. If she did not become converted, at
   least the manifest interposition of Jehovah might check her hand from
   future persecution. The Prophet hoped that by an influence thus
   established over the king and queen, the whole land would speedily
   glide back to its allegiance to Jehovah. Then would his stern heart
   have been glad before the Lord.

   When he found out that it was not so, his spirit fainted within him.
   The message from Jezebel, that he would be slain the next morning, was
   probably not so terrible to him as the discovery that came with it that
   his great demonstration against Baal was doomed to be a failure. The
   proud Sidonian queen would still rule over vacillating Ahab and,
   through Ahab, she would still keep power over the people--and the idol
   gods would sit safely on their thrones. The thought was gall and
   wormwood to the idol-hating Prophet. He became so despondent that he
   was ready to give up the conflict and to quit the battlefield. He could
   not bear to live in the land where the people were so blindly
   infatuated as to honor Baal and to dishonor Jehovah. He resolved to
   leave right away.

   But where shall he go? He traverses the land in hot haste. He flies
   into the wilderness. He will not lie down till he reaches a solitude
   where foot of man has not defiled the sward. But in which direction
   shall he hasten? He, the great Law-vindicator thinks of the spot where
   once stood the great Law-Giver and so he hastens off to Horeb, to the
   mount of God. In a cave he lodges, perhaps in the very cleft of the
   rock where before God had hidden His servant, Moses, while He made all
   His Glory to pass before him.

   But what a retreat before a beaten enemy! Where, now, is the dauntless
   courage which faced all Israel, one against thousands? How are the
   mighty fallen! Is this my lord, Elijah, crouching in a cave? Is this
   the man who seemed to leap into Israel's history like a lion roaring on
   his prey? Is this Elijah the Tishbite who brought fire and water from
   the skies? Yes, it is even he! He has become faint-hearted and weary
   and, therefore, he has fled his Master's service! It is well for us,
   who are always weak, that we can so clearly see that the strong are
   only strong because God makes them so. Their occasional weakness proves
   that they are naturally as weak as we are--it is only by Divine
   strength that they are made mighty--and this strength is ready to gird
   us, also, for the conflict!

   We take comfort from this, though we do not, from it, excuse our own
   infirmity. The Lord God of Elijah is our God and as He sustained a man
   of like passions with ourselves, He can and will sustain us if we cry
   unto Him! Observe very carefully and gladly how God dealt with His
   downcast servant. He knew that he was faithful at heart. He understood
   that Elijah was a true man who loved his God and feared Him, and was
   very jealous for His honor--therefore He did not put His servant away
   in anger, but He determined to revive and restore him--and bring him
   back to His holy warfare. Now must Elijah learn the meaning of David's
   song, "He restores my soul: He leads me in the paths of righteousness
   for His name's sake."

   The Lord began with him in much tenderness by refreshing his physical
   frame. He permitted him to fall into a sleep and when he was awakened
   there was a cake ready for him and a cruse of water. Then the Lord
   allowed him to sleep

   again, for this he greatly needed. We do not lose the time we spend in
   sleep when we are worn out with fatigue. It is the best economy of life
   to let the body have a sufficiency of kind Nature's sweet
   restorer--balmy sleep. God gave His servant, after a second sleep, a
   second meal and, thus refreshed, Elijah was able to look at things in a
   more cheery light. Time was when Christian people thought very little
   of the corporeal system--they called their physical frame a vile body,
   as, indeed, it is in some sense, but not in every sense.

   If they had any doubts, fears, or trembling, our good fathers laid them
   all on the back of the devil, or else ascribed them to their own
   unbelief, when, frequently, their depressions arose from lack of food,
   or of fresh air, or from a torpid liver, or a weak stomach. A thousand
   things can cast us down and we ought not to despise the body through
   which they act upon us. Rather should we attend to natural laws and so
   look to the God of those laws to help us. God, who made the body, and
   who gave it such a close affinity to the mind, observes how dependent
   the soul is upon the body and often begins His restoring work by
   healing our diseases. We who dwell in houses of clay are often cribbed,
   cabined and confined from loftier things by reason of the dust to which
   our soul cleaves.

   The Lord who heals His people began, in Elijah's case, by refreshing
   his languid frame. He restored Elijah by sleep and by food. If any of
   you here present are depressed and in mental trouble, I would invite
   you to look to your health and not to blame yourselves till first you
   have seen whether your sadness arises from sickness or from sin--from a
   feeble body or a rebellious mind. Do not think it unspiritual to
   remember that you have a body, for you certainly have one and,
   therefore, ought not to ignore its existence. If your heavenly Father
   thinks of your physical frame, He therein gives you a hint to do the
   same. If the Lord, in His wisdom, began with the high-spirited Elijah
   by feeding and refreshing his mortal body, we ought to count it wisdom
   to look to our outward parts! It is of heretics that we read that they
   advocate the neglecting of the body--wise men value it as the temple of
   the Holy Spirit!

   With us it is often the case that, "the spirit truly is willing, but
   the flesh is weak." It is no small thing to get the flesh put in
   order--the physician is often as necessary as the minister. When the
   man of God had been refreshed by the great Physician, he was led of the
   Lord to Horeb, where he would be quite alone. The Lord knew that he
   needed quiet as well as sleep and food and there, among the lone crags,
   where utter desolation reigns undisturbed, Elijah found himself
   somewhat at home. When the quiet had, in a measure, calmed his mind,
   the Lord began to speak with him. He bade him go forth and stand upon
   the mount before the Lord. No sooner had the Prophet come to the mouth
   of the cave than a tremendous hurricane swept down the rifts of the
   valleys with such force that it tore the mountains and brought down
   great masses of granite from their lofty summits!

   The great and strong wind seemed to shake the mountains to their
   foundations and huge columns which long had breasted ordinary storms
   began to rock and reel and fall about the lone observer with thundering
   crashes. The Prophet was not at all alarmed. He was the child of the
   storm, a reprover born to rule amid tempestuous scenes. It is very
   possible that his spirit felt exhilarated by the terrors around him.
   The tumult in which he had lived among the people was now imaged before
   him in the strife of the elements. I should not wonder if he even felt
   at home, joyously excited as the terrific blast swept over the
   mountains' brows. As he stood at the mouth of the cave, the earth gave
   way beneath his feet--he leaned against the mountain and, lo, it shook
   and quivered, for now the earthquake was passing by and it seemed as if
   nothing was stable around him.

   Scarcely had this convulsion ceased than the fire displayed its
   brightness. The lightning flamed over the whole Heaven, attended by
   peals of thunder such as the man of God had never heard before. From
   crag to crag leaped the live lightning till the whole firmament blazed
   with the fire of God! Yet we do not find that the Prophet was in the
   least cowed or dismayed. His was a brave spirit--calm amid the storm.
   As the eagle mounts in the center of the lightning and rises on the
   wings of the storm, so did it seem with Elijah's spirit--he was
   awakened by the fury of the elements, but he was not afraid. And now
   the thunder ceased and the lightning was gone. The earth was still, the
   wind was hushed and there was a dead calm.

   And out of the midst of the still air there came what the Hebrew calls,
   "a voice of gentle silence," as if silence had become audible! There is
   nothing more amazing than an awful stillness after a dread uproar. Even
   the noise of the wind and of the storm which could not cow Elijah were
   not so terrible as the still small voice by which Jehovah called His
   servant near. Then the Prophet covered his face and went to the mouth
   of the cave and stood to listen, for the still small voice had won the
   solemn attention of his soul. It had done for him what all the rest
   could not do--for this reason that

   the Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the
   fire--but the Lord was in the still small voice and Elijah knew it and
   was awed and prepared himself to hear what God, the Lord, would speak.

   What is the lesson of this? May God the Holy Spirit help us this
   morning to learn it and to teach it.

   I. First, I call your attention to THE CHOSEN AGENCY. Notice at the
   outset what it was not. It was not the terrible, it was not the
   tremendous, it was not the overwhelming, but something the reverse of
   all these. It was not a grand display of power, for God was in none of
   those great things which Elijah saw and heard. That which conquered
   Elijah's brave heart was not whirlwind, was not earthquake, was not
   fire--it was the still small voice! That which effectually wins human
   hearts to God and to His Christ is not an extraordinary display of
   power. Men can be made to tremble when God sends pestilence, famine,
   fire and others of His terrible judgments--but these things usually end
   in the hardening of men's hearts, not in the winning of them.

   See what God did to Pharaoh and his land. Surely those plagues were
   thick and heavy--the like of which had never been seen before, yet what
   was the result? "And Pharaoh's heart was hardened." So it usually is.
   These things are well enough as preliminaries to the Divine Gospel
   which gently conquers the heart, but they do not, of themselves, affect
   the soul--

   "Law and terrors do but harden

   All the while they work alone.

   'Tis a sense of blood-bought pardon

   That dissolves a heart of stone." The still small voice succeeds where
   "terrible things in righteousness" are of no avail. I do not wonder
   that Elijah hoped that the terrible judgments would prevail with his
   countrymen--these terrible things appear to be a rough and ready way
   for overcoming evil and, indeed, they would prevail if men's hearts
   were not so "deceitful above all things and desperately wicked."

   Have you not judged that if God would send a pestilence to our
   thoughtless city it might, perhaps, impress the thoughtless crowd and
   drive to our Houses of Prayer those who now habitually waste the
   Sabbath? Might not cholera, or war, or famine alarm the consciences of
   the careless and drive the ungodly to their knees? Have you not thought
   that perhaps the screening which God has given us in saving us from the
   plagues of war and from innumerable evils may have tended to breed in
   men's hearts presumption, carelessness and indifference? One could
   almost say to Christ, when we think of the sin of our fellow men, "Will
   You that we call fire from Heaven upon them as Elijah did?" We
   frequently imagine that the terrors of the Lord would persuade men and
   compel them to seek rest in the bosom of their God.

   Thanks be to infinite mercy, the Lord does not, at this present time ,
   choose the terrible way of action! He leaves the wind. He leaves the
   earthquake and the fire and He speaks to men in the silence of their
   souls by a voice which, though it is as, "silence audible," yet it is
   the power of God unto salvation! But we are hard to convince that it is
   so. We still cling to the idea that outward pomp of tremendous power
   would advance the Kingdom of God. We are not so ready to dispense with
   the 12 legions of angels as our Master was. So far as our own action is
   concerned, we are poor disciples of Him of whom we read, "He shall not
   strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets."
   In our religious exercises we are too apt to rely upon carnal force and
   energy. We are hopeful if we can make a noise, create excitement, stir
   and agitation. We are too apt to identify the power of God with the
   heaving of the masses under newly invented excitements!

   This age of novelties would seem to have discovered spiritual power in
   brass bands and tambourines--and it is hoped that souls which could not
   be saved by a Church may be reached by an army--and minds that were
   insensible to Gospel arguments, it is supposed, can be charmed by
   banners! Simple Apostolic teaching is at a discount and we are treated
   to more sensational methods! The tendency of the time is towards
   bigness, parade and show of power, as if these would surely accomplish
   what more regular agencies have failed to achieve. But it is not so, or
   else both men and God have greatly changed! The same tendency appears
   in the too common saying, "At least we must have an eloquent
   preacher--let us have one who can plead with choice, picked words--a
   master of the art of oratory! Surely this we may rely upon and fall
   back upon earnest pleading and intense, awakening speech."

   But, perhaps, God will not choose this form of power, for still He will
   not have our faith to stand in the wisdom of words. He will have us
   learn this lesson, "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says
   the Lord." Crash after crash the orator's passages succeed each other!
   What a tremendous passage! The hearers must surely be impressed. Wind!

   And the Lord is not in it! And now everything seems to shake, while,
   like a second John the Baptist, the minister proclaims woe and terror
   and pronounces the curse of God upon a generation of vipers! Will not
   this break hard hearts? No! Nothing is accomplished. It is an
   earthquake, but the Lord is not in the earthquake!

   Another form of force remains. Here comes one who pleads with
   vehemence! All on fire, he flashes and flames! Look at the brightness
   of his sensational metaphors and anecdotes! Yes, fire! Might we not say
   fireworks? And yet the Lord does not work by such fire. The Lord is not
   in the fire! The furious energy of unbridled fanaticism, the Lord does
   not use. He may employ great and terrible things as preliminaries to
   His soul-saving work, but they are only preliminaries--the work,
   itself, is done in the secret silence of the heart. As they were in
   Elijah's case, so are these things in the cases of oth-ers--they
   startle and arouse, but they cannot convince and convert. That which is
   to quicken, enlighten, sanctify and really bless is the still small
   voice of gentle silence! This sounds like a paradox, but the sense is
   clear to him who knows the Truth of God by experience. The voice which
   is not heard outside is Omnipotent within.

   We have sufficiently shown the negative side of it--God's work stands
   not in the power of the creature. What, then, does God use to touch the
   heart? Our heavenly Father generally uses that which is soft, tender,
   gentle, quiet, calm, peaceful--a still small voice. In the work of real
   conversion--of bringing the soul to decision and complete obedience to
   God--the calling voice is often so gentle that it is quite unperceived
   by others except in its results. Yes, frequently so gentle that it is
   almost unperceived by the man who is the subject of it! He may not even
   be able to tell exactly when the voice came and when it went. The
   gentle zephyr refreshes the fevered brow, but the sufferer scarcely
   knows that it has passed through the sick chamber and is gone, so soft
   is its Heaven-given breath.

   In reconciliation there are no blows, nor beats of drums, nor bolts of
   tempests--love is the captain of this bloodless war! There is little
   display of physical or mental force and yet there is more real power
   than if force had been used! We observe that where there was a display
   of power, as in wind, earthquake and fire, we read afterwards, "God was
   not in it," but here, in this still small voice in which there was no
   display of power, God was at work! Here, then, we see the weakness of
   power, but we learn also the power of weakness and how God often makes
   that which seems most resistible to be irresistible--and that which we
   would suppose to be easily waved away, weaves about a man fetters from
   which he never can escape!

   Softly and gently works the Holy Spirit, even as the breath of spring
   which dissolves the iceberg and melts the glacier. When frost has taken
   every rivulet by its throat and held it fast, spring sets all free. No
   noise of hammer or of file is heard at the loosening of the fetters,
   but the soft south wind blows and all is life and liberty. So is it
   with the work of the Spirit of God in the soul when He actually comes
   to set the sinner free! He works effectually, but no voice is heard.

   Now, whatever the soft and gentle instrumentality may be, it is, in
   every case, if it saves the soul, worked by the Holy Spirit's Presence.
   And the Holy Spirit, though He can be "a rushing, mighty wind" when He
   wills--for He comes according to His own Sovereign pleasure. Yet,
   usually, when He comes to bring to man the peace of God, descends as
   the dove, or as the dew from Heaven--all peace, gentleness and quiet.
   Satan can set the soul on fire with agony! Doubts and fears and terrors
   rend it like an awful earthquake! The whole man is in trouble and
   confusion, as the whirlwind of the Law sweeps through his soul! But the
   Spirit comes in tender love, revealing Christ, the Gentle One, setting
   up the Cross of the Savior before the sinner's tearful eyes and
   speaking peace, pardon and salvation.

   Brothers and Sisters, this is what we need--the work of the Spirit of
   God in His own manner of living love! I have said that He works usually
   to the salvation of the soul by revealing the love of Christ and it is
   so, not only at our first conversion, but afterwards. All along, His
   operations are after the same quiet and effectual kind. As we grow in
   sanctifi-cation, it is by tender revelations of the Father's love. What
   has such influence over any of us as the infinite, overflowing Grace of
   God in our Lord Jesus Christ? You know how Mr. Monod, in His sweet hymn
   sets forth not only our growth in sanctification, but the gentle
   instrument of it--

   "Yet He found me I beheld Him,

   Bleeding on the accursed tree,

   Heard Him pray 'Forgive them, Father'

   And my wistful heart said fondly

   'Some of self and some of Thee,'

   Day by day His tender mercy,

   Healing, helping, full, and free,

   Sweet and strong, and oh, so patient, Brought me lower, while I
   whispered, 'Less of self and more of Thee.'" Still you perceive it is
   the operation of love upon the soul which works it all--

   "Higher than the highest heavens, Deeper than the deepest sea Lord,
   Your love at last has conquered, Grant me now my spirit's longing, None
   of self, but all of Thee."

   Thus, like the silent morning light, Grace works upon the man. Its
   processes are carried on by love. There is not a touch of terror or
   bondage in the great reconciling deed within. The Gospel, with its glad
   tidings, leaps out of the heart of God and enters into the heart of
   men--and rest and sacred gratitude follow. God may devour His enemies
   with lions, but His friends He wins with love! Those that are obdurate
   He will break as with a rod of iron, dashing them in pieces like
   potters' vessels--but for His own--when He comes to save them, He
   touches them with the silver scepter of mercy! Grace works with the
   oiled feather. Love is the chariot of Omnipotence when it comes into
   the world of mind. This, my dear Friends (to close this first head),
   coming quietly home to us, to each one of us individually, without
   animal excite-ment--this it is which unites us to Jesus by faith!

   Elijah was calm and quiet when he heard that still small voice of God!
   He neither fell down in horror, nor danced for joy, yet his whole
   nature was touched, his inmost heart was convulsed. The silence which
   God had caused to be heard within him, thawed his soul. This is how
   conversions are worked. When the Truth of God comes right home to the
   heart; when the man perceives that the message of Grace belongs to
   him--when he grips and grapples with that Truth and that Truth with
   him--then without help from the outside, he seeks and finds eternal
   life! The still small voice within the conscience is God's chosen
   instrumentality to effectually convert and comfort the souls of men!
   The Kingdom of God comes not with observation--but in the secret
   chamber, man is brought near to God.

   II. Notice THE CHOICE EFFECTS of this chosen mode of working. The first
   effect of it upon Elijah was that the man was subdued. I have gone over
   this before. He who could confront the raging wind. He who was not
   terrified by the lightning, nor made to tremble at the earthquake--the
   moment he was in that stillness and heard that gentle voice-- wrapped
   his face in his sheepskin robe and went outside the cave like a child
   obedient to the call of his heavenly Father. And when the Spirit of God
   comes in His gentle power upon any of you, then you will resist no
   longer--you will be subdued and conquered by His soft and tender touch.

   The first thing Elijah did, I said, was to wrap his face in his mantle,
   therein imitating the angels who cannot stand unveiled in that awful
   Presence. He did his best to hide his face, like one ashamed--ashamed
   of having doubted his God, of having played the coward--ashamed of
   being found away from the place of his service. When the Holy Spirit
   deals with men and women, this is an early effect upon their
   minds--shamefacedness and humiliation cover their faces--

   " Confounded, Lord, I wrap my face, And hang my guilty head; Ashamed of
   all my wicked ways, The hateful life I've led."

   They cannot speak in the same bold tones as they were known to do! All
   boasting is excluded. For some time, at any rate, they have to learn
   how to behave themselves in the Divine Presence--for walking in the
   Light as God is in the Light is not easy for newly-converted
   sinners--their eyes are weak and tender and, therefore, they have to
   cover them from the blaze of the eternal light. Love is the triumphant
   power! Where mere power and thunder fail, it leads the heart in glad
   captivity.

   Now, as I have said, wind nor tempest could produce this in Elijah, but
   the still small voice of God did it at once--

   "Lord, You have won, at length I yield! My heart, by mighty Grace
   compelled, Surrenders all to You! Against Your terrors long I strove,
   But who can stand against Your love? Love conquers even me!

   If You had bid Your thunders roll, And lightning flash, to blast my
   soul, I still had stubborn been. But mercy has my heart subdued, A
   bleeding Savior I have viewed, And now I hate my sin."

   It appears, in reading the chapter, as if the Prophet did not come out
   of the cave until he heard that voice. He was called upon by God to
   come out and stand in the open before the Most High, but as I read it,
   he had not done this until the still small voice called him and drew
   him in the way of the command so that obedience is a second blessed
   effect. Shamefaced on account of his errors, he is now resolved to
   follow his Lord's word at once. And he stands at the opening of the
   cave to hear what God, the Lord, will speak. If the Spirit of God shall
   work effectually upon any of us, one of the first marks of it will be
   that while we are humbled because of sin, we shall grow earnest to work
   righteousness. Grace makes us tender in the matter of obedience.

   Those who hear the voice of the Lord are sure to cry, "Lord, show me
   what you would have me to do." When that voice wins the willing ear, it
   creates a ready foot to go where God bids us. Our desire is to know the
   Lord's will and promptly to fulfill it, for the heavenly whisper has
   for its burden--"Follow Me." And now that Elijah has come out into the
   clear air, the next effect upon him is that he has personal dealings
   with God. The voice says to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" It
   is a home enquiry, made to himself, alone. He knows that God is
   speaking with him and, therefore, he feels the force of every word
   which searches him. Then he pours out the bitterness of his grief and
   tells the Lord what ails him.

   The Spirit is surely at work with you when your converse is with the
   Lord alone. When you want nobody to hear what you have to say, but are
   glad to enter into your closet and shut the door and pray to your
   Father, who sees in secret, this is real work, the work of God! When
   you feel every line of the Word of God as you read it as if it were
   written for you, and you, alone--when you think that nobody else in the
   world can enter so fully into it, in your judgment, as you now do, for
   the sentences seem shaped for you and there are little words dropped
   into the threat and the promise exactly adapted for you--then it is
   that the still small voice is executing its sacred office! This is a
   main point, this contact of the soul with God--this breaking down of
   the barriers of things visible, this closing in with God, the Unseen.

   Oh, it is a sight such as angels delight to behold when a man bows
   before the Most High and listens to his great Father's voice and then
   tells out to Him all his heart without attempting to hide anything from
   Him! This is never produced by whirlwind, fire, or earthquake--it is
   the effect of the voice of gentle silence, for God is in it! Vain are
   eloquence, argument, music and sensationalism--the Spirit works all
   holy things and He, alone--and this He works in the solemn silence of a
   soul subdued by love!

   III. In the third place, let us say a little concerning THE LESSON
   WHICH ELIJAH LEARNED from this acted parable. He, himself, had taught
   the people by deeds rather than words and now he is, himself, similarly
   instructed. He was taught several things which it was essential for him
   to know. And among them, first, that God does not always use the means
   which we suppose He will use. We sit down and think how a nation can be
   blessed and we form our own ideas of the most excellent way. But our
   thoughts are not the Lord's thoughts, for as the heavens are high above
   the earth, so are His thoughts above our thoughts and His ways above
   our ways.

   I dare say you, my sanguine Brother, have a well-ordered scheme in your
   own mind which you would like to see worked out, by which the Gospel
   would be made known to heathen lands very rapidly. So many workers of
   one kind are to assist a certain number of a higher grade and by a wise
   division of labor and allotment of districts, the work is to be
   systematically done. Be not too fond of favorite methods or you may
   suffer great disappointment, for God, as a rule, does not use our
   schemes! The great steps of the Infinite are not to be measured by our
   childish walk! It is not ours to propose to Him what He shall do, nor
   how or when He shall do it, but we must leave to His Sovereign will to
   choose and to com-mand--and we shall yet see how wondrous He is in His
   workings!

   Elijah's life had been one continued storm. From the first time when he
   appears as the Prophet of fire till he fled from Jezebel, he had always
   spoken out of the whirlwind and either threatened or executed the
   judgments of the Lord. And it may be he relied too much upon this form
   of ministry. No doubt it was right in him to rebuke a sinful and
   obstinate people, but still, God would let him know that Carmel, with
   its complete victory over Baal's priests till its rivulets

   ran red with their blood, was not the way by which God would vanquish
   His enemies. Men would not worship God aright merely because in an
   excited moment they had slain a band of impostors! The heart is not won
   to loving reverence by slaughter! It is not by blood that men are
   baptized into spiritual worship.

   This same lesson has to be learned over and over by us all--let us
   repeat it--"Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the
   Lord." It is to be lamented that the most of professors obstinately
   cling to the fatal error of looking for displays of power of one kind
   or another. I hear that a certain Church is seeking for a very clever
   man--she thinks that God is in the wind. I hear the deacons say, "We
   must look out for the best man. No matter what we give, nor what Church
   we rob of its minister, we must get a first-class man and then we shall
   have a full house and see many converted." Nothing of the kind! It is
   not God's way to work by clever men and men who aim at grandeur of
   speech! He may, if so He pleases, permit the house to be thronged with
   attentive hearers--but converts will be few when people are relying
   upon cleverness!

   "Oh, but we must have a first-rate organization! We must work the
   Church up by revival services." Yes, do it, and do it again, if you
   choose, and the result may be good if you can do the work humbly. But
   if you trust one iota upon the means employed, away will depart the
   Spirit and you will see nothing but your own folly! That still small
   voice will be hushed and silent while the boasts of your wisdom
   resounds like a howling wind or a thunder unaccompanied by rain! We
   must know this--that God will work by what means He pleases and, next,
   that all means are useless apart from Him! All wind, all fire, all
   earthquake, all power and grandeur fail unless the still small voice is
   there and God is in it. The Church has had this dinned into her ears
   and doctrinally she believes it, but, alas, she practically goes forth
   and behaves as if the opposite theory were true! She looks for Divine
   results to human causes and is, therefore, full often deceived. Too
   much is her dependence fixed upon an arm of flesh and while this is so,
   we cannot expect to see the bare arm of the Eternal displayed in the
   midst of our camps.

   God would have Elijah know another thing and He would have us know it,
   too--that our weakness may be our strength. Elijah did not know
   anything about those 7,000 converts of his who had been won by the
   silent voice of his devoted life. Because the success of Carmel melted
   like the morning mist, he thought that his career had been a failure
   all along and that he had brought no one to reverence Jehovah. But he
   was reading with the eyes of unbelief and his imagination was leading
   him, rather than the facts of the case! Here are 7,000 people scattered
   up and down the country to whom God has blessed Elijah's testimony! If
   He had not blessed his big things as Elijah had desired, yet his little
   things had prospered greatly. It was Elijah's daily conduct rather than
   his miracles which had impressed these 7,000 and led them to hold fast
   their integrity. The Lord would have us know that He works rather by
   our weakness than by our strength--and often makes most use of us when,
   in our own judgment, we have displayed nothing but our feebleness.

   Moreover, the Lord would have us note the strength of other people in
   their weakness. That lesson we do not always catch up so soon as we do
   the first. We are pleased to learn that when we are weak we are strong
   because being generally weak we are glad to learn that we are usually
   strong. But we speak not thus of others who may, in some respects, be
   our inferiors. If we see a man a little more energetic than usual, we
   enquire petulantly, "Lord, and what shall this man do?" If some holy
   woman bursts out into pleading testimony, we say, "She had better be
   quiet. Nothing will come of her talking." A work is doing over yonder
   and we do not quite approve of its methods and, therefore, we cry,
   "Foolishness!" Ah, but Brother, you have to learn the strength of other
   weak people as well as of yourself!

   You know that there are others as weak as you. You are very glad to
   find that out and go and tell it--but there are also others as strong
   as you whom God makes strong because they are weak, dealing with them
   in His tender loving kindness just as He does with you! Oh that you
   would learn this and then you will see that there are not only one or
   two faithful workers, but thousands who are true to their Lord and
   valiant for the Truth of God upon the earth! The Lord still has a
   remnant who are as faithfully serving Him as you are--they have not
   bowed the knee to Baal nor kissed the calves, but still stand erect in
   their testimony to God. Believe this and be happy, for God wants you to
   believe it!

   He is not always with our powerful preachers, our learned canons, our
   reverend bishops, our great generals and all that! But He may be with
   that poor young Brother who stands at the corner of the streets and
   speaks such broken sentences. And with that dear Sister who takes a
   dozen or two girls and teaches them the Savior's love! You wonder what
   these can possibly have to teach and yet the Lord is quietly and
   effectually speaking by their gentle voices. We are wonderful
   critics--handy and keen at pulling the Lord's servants to pieces! But
   the mercy is the Lord takes a sweet vengeance

   on us, for them, by giving them all the greater blessing so that our
   judgment may be set on one side and that we may understand that He
   still speaks by whom He wills and uses whom He chooses!

   And so this Truth of God is always sure--"Not by might, nor by power,
   but by My Spirit, says the Lord of Hosts." The still small voice of the
   humble retired Christian may have more power in it, under God, than all
   the thunder and the lightning of the greatest orator that ever pleaded
   for Christ!

   IV. Lastly, LET US LISTEN this morning--let the listening be practiced
   at once and most reverently. If we are too many to do it here, let us
   get home to our own rooms and listen there. Especially do I address
   myself to you who do not know the Lord--you cannot cause the still
   small voice to be heard--but often, by making silence and sitting still
   in it, you may hear that call of tender love. What does it say to you
   unconverted people? Does it not speak to your consciences and ask, "How
   is it that you have lived so long in the Light of God and yet have
   never seen it? How is it you have dwelt so long in the atmosphere of
   love and yet have never felt it? How is it that Jesus Christ has been
   preached to you and you know He is the only Savior, and yet you have
   rejected Him?"

   Years are coming upon you. Your hair is turning gray. You have always
   hoped and half resolved that there should be a time of change for you
   and yet you are just the same. I will not speak for your conscience,
   but I do ask your conscience to enquire of you, "Why do you use your
   best Friend so evilly? Why do you slight His bleeding love? Why do you
   postpone Him for any trifle and are always saying, 'Go Your way for
   this time. When I have a more convenient season I will send for You'"?
   When conscience has done speaking, then let Jesus speak. And what will
   He say? "I have loved you and given Myself for you: why do you despise
   Me? I have come to you and spoken in accents of love and I have bid you
   trust Me, and I have said I will not cast you out if you will come to
   Me. Why do you not come and trust?"

   Let His soft voice be heard, the voice of the Babe of Bethlehem, the
   voice of the dying Lamb on Calvary! Let Him plead with you, "Come unto
   Me, and I will give you rest." Hear His voice! Let other sounds be
   hushed that you may hear it. Get quiet at home and bend your ear,
   hearkening diligently to the voice of Mercy from the bleeding Son of
   God! Then let the great Father speak and say, "Come to Me, My child.
   You have wandered, but I am still ready to receive you. If you will
   come to Me in truth, confessing your transgression, I am faithful and
   just to forgive you your sin and to save you from all unrighteousness.
   Come unto Me, and you shall live in My household and enjoy all the
   privileges of My children."

   Equally listen diligently to the teachings of the Holy Spirit. Sit down
   and say, "Speak, blessed Spirit, speak to me." You cannot do better,
   this afternoon, than set aside a silent time that you may incline your
   ears unto the Spirit of Grace. Give yourself an hour of quite, alone,
   and sit still and say, "Now, Lord, You blessed Spirit, speak to the
   breaking of my heart with shame for my transgressions. Speak, then, to
   the healing of my heart as I believe in Jesus. Speak to me while I wait
   for You." Oh, how many would get a blessing if they did this!

   Finally, let me, with most tender accents, ask each unconverted one the
   question Jehovah asked of Elijah. "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
   What brought you here this morning? Did you come to worship God, or to
   gratify curiosity, or merely because it is a proper thing--to go to a
   place of worship on a Sunday? "What are you doing here, Elijah?" What
   have you been doing all morning? When the hymn was lifted up, did you
   praise or did you mock? And when prayer was offered did you join in it
   or have you been sitting here insulting the Most High by offering Him
   the outside of devotion while your heart has been far from Him? "What
   are you doing here, Elijah?"

   Oh, that you would reply, "I do repent of what I have done and of what
   I have not done! And I lay myself down at the Father's feet and beseech
   Him, for Jesus' sake, to have pity upon me and forgive me my
   transgressions!" You are forgiven already if you believe in Christ
   Jesus! If you trust your soul with Jesus, go your way--there is no sin
   in God's book against you, now--He has blotted out your transgressions
   and will no more remember your sins! It shall be a happy day, for the
   voice shall speak to you this morning and never leave off speaking till
   the King shall come in His Glory and take you to His right hand! The
   Lord bless you, dear Friends, by His own Spirit, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Teaching for the Outer and Inner Circles

   (No. 1669)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 16, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And with many such parables spoke He the Word unto them, as they were
   able to hearit. But without a parable He did not speak to them: and
   when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples." Mark
   4:33,34.

   OUR blessed Lord had two great objectives before Him in His ministry.
   The first was to preach the Word to the outlying masses, that out of
   them He might gather a people to Himself who should be His disciples.
   This part of His work He carried on with great diligence and
   perseverance, traversing the Holy Land from end to end and finding
   here, one, and there, another, but never ceasing to preach the Gospel
   to the crowds that flocked to Him. His second objective was to train
   those who became His disciples, that having gathered them to Himself,
   He might educate them in the Truth of God. He taught them concerning
   the Father and His love. He taught them concerning Himself, His work,
   His death and His Resurrection. And He taught them concerning the
   Divine Comforter and His indwelling and all else that would make for
   their progress and profit.

   While our Lord was here, He gathered the men together who should carry
   on the work after He was gone. He did not think it enough to make
   converts--He wished to make disciples! He did not think it enough,
   even, to make beginners in discipleship, but He would have them advance
   in knowledge and in holiness, learning till they were able to teach
   others. To this day this same double work is carried on by the Divine
   Spirit through the ministers and servants of God. We are to preach to
   the multitude who make up the outer ring, for our Lord has said, "Go
   you into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." We are
   bound to evangelize all, making no distinction of rank or character. To
   every person with whom we may come in contact, we are to proclaim the
   Kingdom of God. That being done, however, the minister's work is only
   begun, for He is now to go on to expound the mystery, to open up the
   higher doctrine, to lead the dis-cipled ones into the deep things of
   God that there may be fathers, instructors, and leaders in the Church.
   And that the Church may, in all the generations yet to come, until the
   Lord Himself appears, carry out the glorious purposes of God for the
   building up of a spiritual house and the conquest of the world.

   I want, this morning, to call your special attention to the way in
   which the Lord spoke to the outside gathering and, then, afterwards, to
   the way in which He spoke to the inner circle of His own disciples.
   From His conduct we may learn our own. Soul-winners and soul-helpers
   may here see their double work set before them in pattern. We shall see
   how Jesus first fetched home the prodigal sons and then made music and
   dancing inside the house for them--how He went after the lost sheep and
   brought them back upon His shoulders--and how He, afterwards, folded
   and fed the sheep which He had saved. There must be much in all this to
   instruct those of us who work for Jesus.

   I. First, let us study our Lord's conduct towards THE OUTSIDE
   GATHERINGS. Kindly read these verses--"And with many such parables
   spoke He the Word unto them, as they were able to hear it. But without
   a parable spoke He not unto them." First, when our Divine Lord preached
   to the outside multitude, He always spoke "the Word" to them. You see
   here what He preached--He spoke "the Word" unto them. This is a very
   short description, but it is intensely full of meaning. It has much
   more of fullness in it than I can show you just now. He always spoke
   "the Word"--that is to say, whatever sort of congregation gathered to
   Jesus, He had only one grand system of Truth to set before them. He
   preached "the Word," which of old was prophesied by men of God and was
   written upon the roll of Inspiration.

   The term, "the Word," shuts up into a small compass the glorious
   Revelation of God which He has shown to us by Christ Jesus. "The
   Word"--here is unity--He preached not two gospels, but one. His Word
   was not yes and no. It was a special message--not a word, but the
   Word--the special speech of the Father. Jesus had received one weighty,
   all-important message from God and this He delivered whenever He had
   opportunity. It was never His objective, when He was addressing the
   people, to speak to them upon subjects of merely temporal interest--He
   preached the eternal Word of

   God. He did not come to instruct them in geology, or astronomy, or
   jurisprudence, or politics--His one business was to win their souls by
   proclaiming the love and mercy of the Father.

   He did not even come to open up a fresh system of morals, though of
   necessity a system of morals grew out of His central teaching. He came
   to preach the Gospel and He preached nothing else! He spoke it in
   various ways, yet He always spoke the one thing--"the Word." "He spoke
   the Word unto them"--to publicans and harlots, or to Pharisees and
   Sadducees. He declares to the blinded Jews, "I speak that which I have
   seen with My Father." "He whom God has sent speaks the Words of God."
   What a lesson this is to all of us who try to do good in the world by
   teaching! We have only to preach "the Word!" Some fancy that they have
   to preach the thought, the deep thought, the wonderful thought of
   modern times. I have heard that expression, "modern thought," till I am
   sick of it! It is a cant phrase smelling strongly of self-conceit!

   There is no command given in Scripture for us to go and preach our own
   thoughts! We are always commanded to preach "Christ" and to publish His
   Word. "The Word" is the summary of God's thoughts, or rather of such of
   God's thoughts as He chooses to reveal to men--such as He regards it
   important for them to know. The Lord has spoken already all that we
   have to speak. Our message is prescribed, our testimony is written. As
   to the saving Truth of God, we have no room for invention. We have no
   scope for discovery--our range is specified, our course is mapped out.
   We have to go and preach "the Word" which is laid down by the Holy
   Spirit in this Book and has been taught to us, personally, by the Holy
   Spirit sent down from Heaven. Our Lord's mind was thoughtful, His
   genius profound and yet He kept to "the Word," even as He said, "He
   that sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I
   have heard of Him."

   If He had pleased, He might have told us many things hidden from before
   the foundation of the world. He might have opened up deep mysteries and
   profound secrets which He knew as the Son of God, for He is the Wisdom
   of God. But instead of that, He concentrated His ministry upon that
   which God had revealed and He preached only "the Word." "The Word" is
   an utterance from the mouth of God and Jesus was God's mouth to
   men--all His teaching was the Father's Word in one way or other. He
   confessed, "The Words that I speak unto you, I speak not of Myself." He
   said, also, "As My Father has taught Me, I speak these things." "The
   Word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me."
   Originality of doctrine finds no sanction in the Savior's
   ministry--true ministers repeat what they are told, they do not
   fabricate for themselves--they are not spiders to spin a web out of
   their own insides.

   Now, beloved Brothers and Sisters, let us remember this whenever we are
   trying to win a soul for Christ. Souls are won by "the Word." It is the
   Word of God that is "quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged
   sword." It is "the Word" which is "the living and incorruptible Seed
   which lives and abides forever." Therefore we must stick to "the Word."
   "Oh," say some, "there are many that have been sitting under the
   old-fashioned Gospel for years and they are not converted." What do you
   propose to do? Do you propose to preach another Gospel? Look, Sir, if
   they were not saved by the Truth of God, they will not be saved by a
   lie!

   It seems, practically, to be conceded that during revivals you may get
   a little beyond the Gospel. When there is an excitement upon the
   people, you may say things which are not strictly accurate and you may
   set yourself right, afterwards, when the desirable effect has been
   produced. This will never do! Not so the Savior--He spoke "the Word"
   unto them, whoever they might be, and He never altered that Word of
   God! I know of no condition of the human mind which can justify me in
   stirring, by the breadth of a hair, from what God has revealed! The
   Gospel is good at all times, in lukewarm times, or in fanatical
   times--and, blessed is he that moors himself to it, or rather is held
   fast by it and has no wish to go beyond it.

   To deliver "the Word" is a plain, simple and easy process, for when we
   have a soul to deal with, the medicine is prescribed and we have only
   to hand it out. The meat, drink and medicine of souls is before us. We
   have not to consider from our own brain a salvation that will fit this
   sinner or that--God has already given us the salvation, the doctrine
   and the Truth which will suit all sinners who will accept it. Your
   judgment and your careful thought will be needed to select the fitting
   portion of the Truth. Your heart will be needed to pray over that
   portion that God may bless it. Your responsibilities are still great,
   but happily you are delivered from the more tremendous task of
   manufacturing a Gospel!

   I see the modern-thought workmen with their bellows full of wind and
   their fire of very small coal. They are puffing away at a great rate.
   And now they take to hammering! See how the sparks fly! They are
   fashioning they know not what! Neither do their people know what they
   may next forge upon the anvil. As for us, we invent nothing, but
   testify what we

   have seen and tasted and handled of the good Word of God! God has
   promised that His Word shall not return unto Him void and, therefore,
   we feel sure of a happy issue. We stand upon blessed ground when we
   determine to speak to the outside world the revealed Word and nothing
   else. Within the circle of "the Word" lies life, healing, peace, joy,
   holiness, Heaven--what more do sinners need? Oh that they would
   "receive with meekness the engrafted Word which is able to save their
   souls."

   Notice next, that our Savior, having no difficulty about His matter,
   but always speaking "the Word," spoke it simply. He never affected
   profundity or obscurity. Our Lord has said many things so deep that
   they are lower than the abyss and He has spoken Truths so high that
   they are higher than the highest Heaven. But still He aimed at being
   understood. Some divines are like the cuttlefish, which, when it
   descends into the sea, often opens its ink bags, darkens the water, and
   hides itself from all observers. It cannot see itself amid the clouds
   which it purposely creates! Too many preachers are endowed with these
   darkening ink bags! When they have simple Truth to preach, they
   surround it with an atmosphere of blackness, darkening counsel and
   involving simplicity in mystery! They are as the west wind, which
   brings clouds. They must be profound if they are anything.

   Now, the Lord Jesus Christ had it in His power to be more profound than
   any man, for He knew all things. Yet He never veiled the Truth, but set
   it forth before the people with clear light and overcoming evidence.
   His speech was always plain as the sun at noon. See how your children
   will read the parables of Jesus and remember them. What is the best
   book to put before a child when it is learning to read? Why, the New
   Testament, for if there are difficulties in the sense, there are none
   in the words! What a multitude of monosyllables we have in John's
   Gospel! The Lord Jesus did not carry a gold pencil case with Him, that
   whenever He met with a word of 12 syllables He might write it down and
   say, "That goes into next Sunday's sermon, and so the people will know
   what a superior Person I am."

   No, but He looked about to find homely similes and instructive emblems
   by which to make the Truth of God plain as a pikestaff to those who
   wished to understand it. Of course the brightest light is lost on blind
   eyes, but Jesus never withheld that light. He was all simplicity, so
   that the children gathered around Him, clambered to His knees and loved
   to listen to the gracious words that proceeded out of His mouth! The
   parable was the most effectual way of conveying the Truth of God and,
   therefore, He used it often. And though it did hide the Truth from
   those who were hardened, yet that was their fault, and could not be
   laid at the door of the parable, which, in itself, is a right royal
   method of instruction--a method which throws the labor upon the teacher
   and makes it easy to the learner. Let us learn from our Lord's example
   and remember that we must do the work for those whom we would bless. We
   must make attention an easy matter for them by clearly setting forth
   the Truths of God which we teach.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, when you are teaching others, take care that
   you, yourself, understand that which you would communicate! Whenever a
   man preaches so that you cannot understand him, the secret of it is
   that he does not understand himself, for if he knew what he meant to
   say, he would, probably, be able to say it and you would know what he
   meant by it. But he who is not clear in teaching, in all probability
   does not know what he means. Therein, full often, lies his pretended
   wisdom--you, perhaps, look up and wonder at this superior man, when, in
   fact, he is an inferior man swollen with pretense! It must be so. If he
   were better taught, he would teach better. When a man has studied the
   subject so that he gets a grip of it, he is able to set it out to
   others. But when it passes over his head like a bird of the air, he has
   not seen it and cannot describe it--and neither can any others learn
   from his language. Our Lord and Master taught in the plainest words and
   if His Gospel was hid, it was hidden only to the blind in heart.

   Our Lord also spoke very suitably. He adapted His language to the
   ignorance or knowledge of His audiences. He knew that they would not
   receive abstract truth and, therefore, He seldom dispensed it. He
   wished to instruct rather than to amaze. On the occasion which Mark,
   here, records, "But without a parable spoke He not unto them," it would
   have been unsuitable to have spoken in any other fashion. Do you notice
   Mark's expression, "With many such parables"? "Parables" and many "of
   them"--priceless illustrations were abundant with Him. But Mark says,
   "such" parables-- that is, simple ones, full of the Light of God, for
   the parables in this chapter are particularly plain. The Truth of God
   seems to lie upon the surface of them and, "with many such parables
   spoke He the Word unto them."

   He saw that, just then, the minds of the people were feeble by reason
   of ignorance--they were as sheep not having a shepherd and needed
   careful tending. Though He did, sometimes, deliver the Truth of God
   without a parable, so that they cried, "Now speak You plainly, and
   speak no parable"--yet for the general, when dealing with the mass of
   those

   whose minds were darkened by the Rabbinical teachers of the period, and
   by their own indifference to the Truth--He did continually use the
   simplest parable that could be found. Let us try to do the same. I
   heard a gentleman once say that he found it very difficult to bring his
   mind down to the capacity of children. But the fact was that he had no
   mind of any consequence! He thought himself great, but this was a clear
   sign of littleness! He had something which he mistook for a mind, but
   it was an error on his part to talk of bringing it down--it needed
   raising up!

   Those who clearly know the Truth of God will find children to be a
   congenial auditory. They will pick up similes as pigeons pick up seeds
   and their little eyes sparkle as they catch your meaning. Therefore,
   "many such parables" let us speak to them! If they do not always care
   for the moral, they are, in this, like the people to whom our Lord
   addressed Himself, but He put the Truth in such a form that even if
   they did not care for it, they cared for the picture in which He set it
   forth and listened earnestly to His Words--and so the Truth of God was
   introduced to their minds.

   Dear Friends, notice, again that our Lord spoke considerately. "With
   many such parables spoke He the Word unto them, as they were able to
   hear it." What wisdom there is here--"As they were able to hear it."
   Some of us are not so considerate as we ought to be and drench those to
   whom we would give drink. Our Lord was not too long in His
   discourses--He never wearied the people by a sermon till midnight, as
   Paul did. It is always better to send a congregation away longing than
   loathing! Our Lord knew that earnest attention involves effort and
   tends to exhaustion. True hearing lays a strain upon the mind which
   cannot be overly long endured. None of us have more than a certain
   quantity of attention and when we have used up that certain quantity it
   becomes tiresome for us to hear more.

   We are like narrow-necked vessels and he who tries to fill such a
   vessel all in a moment will spill the most of the fluid. The filling
   must be done gently; the water must be poured in as the vessel is able
   to receive it. So did the Savior, with short parables and sententious
   utterances, pass on from Truth to Truth, as the people were prepared to
   receive His instruction. He moderated the quantity, so that they might
   not be oppressed with too much. He taught "as they were able to hear
   it"--that is to say, He did not puzzle them with deep doctrine when He
   wished to save them--for it is poor work to confuse a man when you want
   to convert him. This Master Teacher gave forth such a quantity of Truth
   as His hearers' hearts could take in and the matter was so chosen as to
   be on the level of their comprehension.

   As for His style, it was so pleasing that they who did not believe in
   Him, nevertheless confessed that, "Never man spoke like this Man." They
   were held as with golden chains by His enchanting manner, for He spoke
   with an evident love to them and with an anxious desire that they
   should receive the Truth of God and should be saved by it. Oh, dear
   Friends, if you want to be useful, be careful to speak considerately!
   If you go into a sick chamber and the person says, "Would you read me
   the 23rd Psalm?" do not bawl it out, but read in gentle tones suitable
   to the poor pained ears and weary brain. If you have to speak a word
   for Christ, let it drop like the gentle dew from Heaven and do not hurl
   it out like a hard driving hailstorm! You cannot bully a man to
   Christ--you will be wise never to attempt it.

   Load the camel as he is able to carry and the mind as it is able to
   bear. Hearts are drawn, not driven. We are not to teach as we are able
   to speak, but as the people are able to hear. We must not exhaust the
   hearer by our attempt to exhaust the subject. Never overdo a good
   thing, lest it be spoiled and rendered of no effect. To conclude this
   matter, our Lord's address to the outside world was such that if they
   did not receive the Truth, the fault lay with themselves. It is true
   the mass of His hearers never saw beneath the surface, for they had no
   heart towards the Truth of God and so the parable did tend to their
   blindness--yet this was not the natural effect of His parable, but the
   misuse of it by slothful and carnal minds. Their foolish hearts were
   darkened.

   Jesus made the Truth of God so clear that their bleary eyes could not
   bear the light! The difficulty with them was that there were so few
   difficulties--the Truth was hard because they were proud! Had they been
   taught of the Father, they would have come to Jesus and delighted in
   the plainness of the Word--but their pride blinded them, even as He
   said, "How can you believe that receive honor, one of another?" They
   rebelled against the Light of God and this was their condemnation! They
   were indignant at being forced to see what they did not wish to see and
   so they resolved to stop in the outward letter of the parable and go no
   further! Let us imitate the Lord Jesus in His endeavor to win souls by
   speaking in such a style that if they are lost, it shall be no fault of
   ours.

   Dear Mr. Whitefield sometimes cried out, "O Sinners, if you are lost,
   it is not for lack of being prayed for, nor for lack of being wept
   over, nor for lack of an earnest anxiety on my part to bring you to the
   feet of Jesus." Make a point of being able to say the same! In your
   class teaching, in your private talks with individuals, so speak that
   you can say, "I am

   clear of your blood. if you do not receive 'the Word' it is because you
   willfully refuse it. I have not concealed the Word of God, neither have
   I embellished it so as to confuse your mind." Oh that every worker here
   might say, "I have strived to commend the Truth of God to every man's
   conscience in the sight of God." Let it be so plain that he may run
   that reads

   it.

   It is better to speak five words which are understood than a thousand
   which merely dazzle the eye of the mind. Use earnest, hearty,
   entreating words. You cannot chill a man into Grace. I do not believe
   that anybody ever rode to Christ on an iceberg--frost and winter play
   but little part in opening the flowers in the King's garden. If icicles
   hang from our lips, we shall not melt men's hearts. Cold hearts must be
   thawed by the warm, genial influence of a sunlit soul. May Heaven's
   light of love rest upon us. It will if we are truly taught of the
   Savior. And now, you that are outsiders, see what trouble the Savior
   takes with you, for what He did for men of His age, He does for men of
   every age--He longs that you should come to Him! He puts the Truth of
   God so that you may see it and He preaches it persuasively and
   affectionately.

   Alas, that men should require such trouble to be taken with them! If
   anyone were giving away gold and silver, he would not need to go down
   on his knees and entreat men to accept the precious metals. But when we
   have to preach "the Word," how must we entreat, implore, beseech men to
   come, or else they will not come at all! Nor even when we have implored
   and besought will they lend a listening ear and a believing heart
   unless the arm of the Lord is revealed. See you to this, you
   outsiders--let the reflection of this make you ashamed and cause you to
   resolve that from now on, having ears to hear, you will hear--and when
   Jesus pleads, you will bow to Him! May God the Holy Spirit make it so!
   Thus have we set forth the manner in which our Lord spoke with the
   outer circle.

   II. Secondly, let us see how Jesus dealt with THE INNER CIRCLE when He
   addressed Himself to His own disciples--"And when they were alone, He
   expounded all things to His disciples." A most precious text! I wish I
   had the whole time for a sermon upon it. Notice, first, then, that the
   Lord Jesus Christ opened up to them the inner meaning of the Word of
   God. Never yet did a man desire to learn of Jesus whom Jesus refused to
   teach. When men did not want to learn, He drew back and did not force
   Himself on them. He kept the exposition of His own teaching for those
   who were prepared to receive it and who really thirsted to obtain
   it--"When they were alone, He expounded all things to His disciples."

   Come now, dear Friends, do we not wish to learn? Shall the Word be to
   us a mere husk with its kernel gone? Are we not anxious to know the
   inner meaning of the doctrine? Shall we be content to observe the
   outside structure of the Truth of God, in the parabolic form, and not
   to enter into its secret chambers and live and dwell in the Truth of
   God, itself? If you desire to have all things expounded, note well that
   those to whom Christ expounded all things were His own disciples! You
   must become a disciple of Christ if you are to know Christ's Truth. A
   disciple of Christ is one who accepts Christ as his teacher and himself
   becomes a learner. A disciple, however, is more than that--he is one
   who receives Christ as his leader and Lord.

   "You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well," said Jesus. Christ the
   Rabbi, the Master, is also Christ the Lord--the Teacher and Leader are
   one. If we are to be His disciples, we must do what He bids us, as well
   as believe what He tells us. Unless we are willing to tread in His
   footsteps and follow His example, we cannot be His disciples. And until
   we are such, He will not expound all things to us. Do you want to
   understand the Scriptures? Do you long to understand the deep things of
   God and the high mysteries of the Word? Then, first, become Christ's
   disciples! "If any man shall do His will, he shall know of the
   doctrine." The teaching of Christ is spirit and life. The rabbis taught
   the letter, but Christ teaches the life and if we submit ourselves to
   Him, to receive His life and to make Him our way, He will, only then,
   be to us the Truth of God!

   But if we refuse Him; if we will not yield to Him; we shall remain in
   darkness with all the rest of the outer circle-- hearing, we shall hear
   and not understand--seeing, we shall see and not perceive. Oh, my
   Hearer, instead of trying to untie all knots and unravel all
   difficulties, first of all yield yourself to Christ! If you would know,
   believe and obey! You must trust Christ, first, and yield yourself up
   wholly to Him and then shall the Divine Light of the Holy Spirit come
   streaming into your soul to open up to you the things hidden from the
   carnally wise! First, we must be, in very deed, the Lord's disciples.

   Some versions have, here, the word, "own." Tischendorf reads it, "To
   His own disciples"--to those whom He acknowledged as truly belonging to
   Him. Our Lord will surely teach His own. "When they were alone, He
   expounded all

   things to His own disciples." If we claim to be His disciples, we must
   cultivate a desire to learn. No man in holy lore learns more than he is
   willing to be taught. Certain ones who call themselves disciples of
   Christ have no wish to learn, but they have a great wish to teach
   before they have learned anything. See the many who run away
   half-hatched, with the shell on their heads and yet they try to crow!
   They cannot teach and they will not learn. If they would wait a little
   while and be instructed, their time might come--but they are so anxious
   to fight that they will neither put on armor nor gird on a sword!

   They are eager to give drink to the thirsty but they cannot spare time
   to fill the cup. How can they sow if they have no seed in the basket?
   Can a man have anything which he has not received? And if he has not
   learned it of the Father, how can he go with any power to tell it unto
   others? We must be anxious to learn. Observe how our Lord Jesus prompts
   His disciples to learn. When He has given them a parable, He says,
   "Have you understood all these things?" He comes near to them when the
   crowd has dispersed and He says to them privately, "Have you understood
   all these things? The crowd knows nothing, but they are gone. They have
   been pleased with My parables, but they have not entered into the soul
   of My teaching. Have you understood all these things?"

   Now, at the end of a discourse that is full of Christ, this is exactly
   what Jesus says to you and to me--"Have you understood all these
   things?" Have you entered into the essential Truth of God and not been
   content to lie sleeping on the doorstep of the mere letter of it? The
   Savior wishes us to be inquisitive, searching into the meaning of "the
   Word." "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst" to know the meaning of
   His Words, for they shall be instructed, for, as I have said before,
   never did a heart hunger to learn and find the Lord unwilling to teach.
   We are to be His disciples and anxious to learn--it follows, in
   consequence, that we must confess that we do not know.

   Many a man might have known if he had but been aware that he did not
   know. A sense of ignorance is the doorstep of the palace of wisdom.
   These men that needed to be instructed by Christ and to have all things
   to be expounded to them were the very pick of the saints--out of them
   came the Apostles and the 70 disciples--and these formed the first row
   of living stones laid upon the foundation to build up a spiritual
   house! And yet these admirable persons needed that they should be alone
   with Jesus to have all things expounded to them! Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, let us not be so wickedly self-conceited as to fancy that we
   know everything!

   Are there not some who think that they carry the Gospel and all the
   doctrines of it in their pockets as if it were a five-sided lozenge?
   They have condensed the infinite into a pentagon! If anyone knows more
   than they know, he is denounced as a heretic, hopelessly unsound! Let
   it not be so with us, for we dare not boast of such perfect knowledge.
   What do we know, my Brethren? If what we do know and what we do not
   know were put together there would be such a difference in the size of
   the volumes that they could not be bound to match! What we know is so
   little compared with what we do not know that we might safely take up
   the language of Isaac Newton, probably the greatest of human
   intellects, when he said that he had been like a child playing on the
   beach who had picked up, here and there, a beautiful shell, while all
   the great deep of the ocean still remained unexplored.

   We are of yesterday and know nothing. Like children, we need teaching!
   Therefore let us be constantly coming to Christ. I do not mean you
   youngsters, only, but the graybeards, the most experienced and most
   advanced among us! Let us be sitting at His feet with Mary, listening
   to that heavenly voice which alone can expound all things to us! I beg
   you to observe carefully that these folk, whom Christ instructed in the
   inner sense, had to be separated from the multitude. "When they were
   alone." When they had got together as birds of a feather should. When,
   like sheep, they were penned in the fold--then the Great Shepherd fed
   them and not till then. Come you out from the world if you would learn
   the deep things of God! The more conformity to the world, the more
   shall we abide in darkness!

   It is amazing what Light of God will come to a man when he learns to
   walk the separated path. There is a way which is narrow as a razor's
   edge--along which none can walk but those whom Christ upholds--but if
   they are willing to walk there in strict integrity, keeping themselves
   from the temptations of the world and rising above the customs of
   society, they shall know the mind of God! "When they were alone." When
   they formed themselves, as it were, into a Church and the rest of the
   congregation went to their own homes--when they distinctly acknowledged
   themselves to be Christ's own disciples--then He expounded the Truth of
   God to them.

   More than this, I will go beyond my text--if you and I wish to know the
   heart of our holy religion, we must get alone--even from the Church,
   with Christ. This is the pith of it--they were alone with Christ. If
   they had been alone

   and Jesus had not been there, they would have learned nothing. But they
   were alone with Him. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, let us practice more
   meditation! We are, none of us, as much alone as we ought to be in
   these busy days. I do not mean merely to pray and read, but to sit
   still and ponder and consider. More of that blessed silence, "frost of
   the mouth and thaw of the soul," is what we greatly need! I find it
   good, in devotion, occasionally to cease praying and look up, gazing
   into the invisible. The heart kindles into admiration of the Person of
   Christ and the soul begins to speak to Him as to a friend, while all
   the inner man is still.

   Do you know what it is to say, "I sleep, but my heart wakes"? Then it
   is that the Lord expounds unto us the Scripture! A good commentary is a
   great help, but communion with the Lord is better! If you want to
   understand a book, there is nothing like asking the author, "Pray, Sir,
   what do you mean by this?" And if you will hasten away to the Author of
   Scripture, how often you will understand what He meant, though the
   words perplex you! I believe you might go the round of all the
   ministers and divines now alive and say to them, "What does this mean?"
   and they could tell you what the letter meant--but after having done
   that, or without doing it--if you would ask the Lord Jesus, He would
   more clearly show you the sense of it.

   Scripture is often like Gideon's fleece, wet through with the heavenly
   dew, but you need to know how to press out the moisture and preserve
   it. The Lord Jesus can show you how to wring it till your bucket is
   filled! We get a precious text, sometimes, and hammer away at it, and
   it does not break up at all. But when we ask the Lord Jesus about it,
   He puts power into our arm of thought and the stone flies to shivers
   the next time we tap it, and we say, "Here is something I never thought
   to find! Here is a mass of gold within this quartz! Here is a diamond
   concealed within this common pebble--how came it there?" Lord,
   enlighten our darkness! Put Your fingers on these eyes, that they may
   behold wondrous things out of Your Law.

   You know the old Arab story of the Muslim who crossed his eyes with a
   magic ointment and straightway, instead of the common house in which he
   lived, he saw a palace sparkling with diamonds, radiant with rubies,
   adorned with emeralds and gold! After such manner the Lord opens up to
   us a passage of Scripture, by anointing our eyes with eye-salve that we
   may see! What sights have we beheld in the Word of God! We have been
   lost in wonder, love and praise! But the Lord does this to us when we
   are alone with Him. "When they were alone, He expounded all things unto
   His disciples."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, I leave this part of the subject and
   conclude when I notice that, in order to get this precious exposition
   from Christ, we must regard Him as being the ultimate and final
   Interpreter. "He expounded all things to His disciples." Those men had
   settled it in their hearts that they would believe whatever He said.
   His ipse dixit was to stand to them instead of argument--He, Himself,
   was to them the Word of God, the Revelation of the Most High, the
   mystic glass into which they looked and saw the Truth of God in all its
   Glory! When they were willing to have it so, they were instructed. The
   key of Scripture is Christ! The only Infallible Interpreter of "the
   Word "is Jesus, the Word! Him we may follow in every case with the
   utmost safety. There is more Truth of God in the Person of Christ than
   there is in all the books that have been written! We hear and read of
   this and that, "body of divinity"--but there is only one body of
   divinity--and that is the body of Jesus Christ!

   Christ Jesus is our divinity. We hear of theology, sometimes. What is
   it? Theology, that is the Word of God, and what is that but Christ?
   Get, then, to be familiar with Him as with a friend, and you shall know
   what He means. I have heard of a wise man of whom they said in his
   biography, that to be acquainted with him was a liberal education. That
   if you went and stayed with him, you might put all your books away, for
   he was a walking encyclopedia. I can hardly think that of any mere man,
   but I am sure it is true of Jesus! Communion with Him is illumination!
   He is that choicest book in the Christian's library which has more
   teaching in it than all besides! The hem of Christ's garment is better
   than all the robes of philosophy!

   There is more to be learned from His footprints than from the most
   profound reasoning of the most learned men. I commend to you, Brothers
   and Sisters, and to myself, also, that we continually sit at Jesus'
   feet. Remember, it was of this that Jesus said, "Mary has chosen the
   good part." She chose to be a learner. She chose to learn from the lips
   of Christ, Himself. May this good part fall to our lot, for if we are
   such learners as this, then our salvation is sure. He that is taught of
   God is taught aright and taught savingly! By such teaching our joy and
   pleasure will be greatly increased. There is little joy in the bare
   externals of the Truth of God--the joy lies within.

   Many a man has come to the Truth as poor children in the street on a
   Christmas night. They come to a house and look through the window and
   see the fire blazing merrily upon the hearth, but the snow is deep and
   their little feet are pinched with cold. If they could enter that cozy
   parlor, they would have warmth and comfort, but in the street all is
   miserable. O you that are outside the Truth of God, peering through its
   windows, you get none of the joy of it! Pass through the Door, which is
   Christ, by a loving faith, and then its entrance shall give you light!
   The joy and mirth of the Truth of God are with the family of God who
   bask in the light of His Countenance! It is for your salvation! It is
   for your delight!

   It is for your security, too, for He that knows the Truth will triumph
   over temptation. He who has been taught of Christ can meet the
   objections of the ungodly. There is more argument for the Gospel in
   Christ, Himself, than in all Apologies and Evidences that were ever
   written. Many defenses of the Gospel have now been prepared and we are
   thankful for them--but if you get to Christ, Himself, you do not need
   such protections! It is to me an unnecessary work when I read defenses
   of Inspiration and of the Gospel. Confirmed Believers do not require
   them! I know the Gospel to be true! I am assured of it in my inmost
   soul! If anybody were to write a book about the excellences of my
   mother and ask me to be a subscriber, I should say, "I know more about
   it than you do. I do not need to read, or listen to arguments. I am
   quite beyond it, for I know her loving care for me." The love of Christ
   shed abroad in the heart is its own evidence! Do they tell us there is
   no Christ? No Christ? Then all life must be a dream, for we know Him
   and have seen Him with the mind's eye!

   Sometimes they say there is no Heaven, as Atheist did in Bunyan's,
   "Pilgrim's Progress." "What?" says Christian to his companion, "Did not
   we see it from the top of Mount Clear when the shepherds lent us their
   optic glass?" Thus the Lord brings eternal things and especially His
   dear Son so vividly before our consciousness that we laugh to scorn the
   wisdom of the skeptic, which is but folly! Let us be earnest to get
   heavenly instruction from Christ, for then we shall be useful--and that
   is the end we aim at. If you do not know the inner Truth of God, what
   good can you do? Here you live in this world among blind men and they
   say, "Lead us!" But if the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall
   into the ditch.

   No! No! You must get your own eyes opened and must know Christ and be
   known of Him--then you can help the poor blind sinner and you can guide
   Him to Jesus! No one knows of what usefulness you will be capable of
   when you have been taught of the Lord! God do so unto you, for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

One Lion, Two Lions, No Lion at All!

   (No. 1670)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE 8, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The slothful man says, There is a lion outside, I shall be slain in
   the streets." Proverbs 22:13.

   "The slothful man says, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the
   streets."

   Proverbs 26:13.

   THIS slothful man seems to cherish that one dread of his about lions as
   if it were his favorite aversion and he felt it to be too much trouble
   to invent another excuse. Perhaps he hugs it to his soul all the more
   because it is a home-born fear, conjured up by his own imagination, and
   as mothers are said to love their weakest children best, so is he
   fondest of this most imbecile of excuses! At any rate, it serves him
   for a passable excuse for laziness, and that is what he wants. If you
   can get the king of beasts to apologize for your idleness, there is a
   sort of royalty about your pretences! He hopes his sloth will appear
   the less disgraceful if he can paint a lion rampant upon its shield. I
   am not about to speak of slothful men in general, albeit that when a
   man does not diligently attend to his business, he is committing great
   wrong to himself and to others. When a man is slothful as a servant, he
   is unjust to his employers, and when he is in business on his own
   account, idleness is usually a wrong to his wife and family.

   I know one who is the cause of poverty and need to those whom he ought
   to provide for--and all because honest labor and he have long since
   fallen out. He would not move an inch if he could help it, nor even
   open his eyes if he could manage to live and sleep all his life away.
   When a man is thoroughly eaten up with the dry rot of laziness, he
   generally finds some kind of excuse, though his crime is really
   inexcusable. "There is a lion in the way" and, therefore, the man
   judges it to be quite right that he should keep his bed, or that he
   should sit leisurely indoors and should not give himself too much
   trouble or run any risks! But all this is mere makeup to screen his
   loathsome vice.

   No Christian ought to be slothful in his ordinary work--the Apostle
   describes the good man as "not slothful in business"--of whatever kind
   that business may be. If you have a right to undertake it. If you have
   a right to continue in it, you have no right to be a sluggard in it.
   There should be as wide a division as between the poles between the
   thought of a Christian and the idea of a sluggard! "Whatever you do, do
   it heartily." An idler is a disgrace to himself and if he professes
   religion, he is a dishonor to it. Paul would starve him, for he says,
   "If any would not work, neither should he eat"--and that is as near
   starvation as can be.

   Popery may create and foster lazzaroni, but the true faith bids every
   man eat his own bread. I leave worldly sluggards to the moralist--does
   not Nature, itself, teach us to labor diligently? Man was not made for
   an idle life. Labor is evidently his proper condition. Even when man
   was perfect, he was placed in the garden, not to admire its flowers,
   but to keep it and to dress it! If he needed to work when he was
   perfect, much more does he require the discipline of labor now that he
   is fallen. Lions or no lions, men must work, or find disease and death
   in sloth!

   But we have many spiritual sluggards and it is to them that I speak.
   They are not skeptics; they are not confirmed infidels; they are not
   opposers of the Gospel. Perhaps their sluggish nature saves them from
   anything like energetic opposition to goodness. They claim that they
   are not averse to the Gospel--on the contrary, they are rather friendly
   to it-- and one of these days they intend to be obedient to its great
   commands and to yield themselves as servants to Christ! But not just
   yet--the good time has not fully arrived. They have a very comfortable
   bed of sloth upon which they lie and they do not want to rise in a
   hurry and exert themselves too much.

   They need to take this matter very leisurely and turn to Christ when it
   is quite convenient--when it will not require so much self-denial as at
   the present moment. "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
   folding of the hands to sleep," is their continual cry! And although
   God's watchmen disturb them terribly and cry aloud that they may wake
   them, yet

   they sleep so heavily that they just turn over when they are most
   disturbed and drop into their slumbers again. I want to cry aloud under
   the window of such sleepers, tonight, with the hope that perhaps some
   of them may be awakened! What do you mean, O Sleeper? Will you sleep
   your soul away? Will you lose Heaven rather than bestir yourself? Will
   you never lift up your eyes till Hell's torments are hopelessly about
   you and within you?

   Our texts speak concerning the sluggard and the first thing you notice
   about him is that his tongue is not slothful-- "The slothful man says."
   The man who is lazy all over is generally very busy with his tongue!
   "The slothful man says, There is a lion outside." In both texts the
   slothful man is represented as having something to say and I think that
   there are no people that have so much to say as those that have little
   to do. Where nothing is done, much is talked about. Their goodness
   begins and ends in mere lip service. They talk about repentance, but
   they do not repent. They are willing to hear about faith and even to
   speak about it, but they do not believe!

   They extol zeal and fervor, but they like to see these active Graces
   rather than to feel them. They will talk till midnight, but all ends in
   smoke. When you sit down to speak with them about the reason that they
   have not given their hearts to Christ, they are not at all short of
   reasons and apologies and excuses. Indeed, a man must be desperately
   hard pushed when he cannot make an excuse! If our first parents made
   garments of fig leaves, there is no fear that their descendants will
   fail to make coverings of some kind or other--and so the slothful man
   with his ready tongue declares that there is a lion in the way--and he
   shall be slain in the streets!

   He is not idle with his mouth. He has a short hand, but a long tongue!
   His imagination, also, is not idle. There were no lions in the streets!
   One does not expect to find lions there. They may be in the desert;
   they may be in the jungle; they may be in the forest; but who expects
   to find lions in the streets of Jerusalem or the lanes of London?
   Laziness is a great lion-maker. He who does little, dreams much! His
   imagination could create not only a lion but a whole menagerie of wild
   beasts--and if some mighty hunter could hunt down all the lions that
   his imagination has let loose, he would soon distribute more herds of
   the terrible animals--with wolves and bears and tigers to match! An
   idler will never be short of difficulties as long as he has no heart
   for work.

   As they say that any stick will do to beat a dog with, so any excuse
   will do to rain your soul with, for this man's objection, after all,
   was not to lions in the way--he objected to the way itself--and he was
   glad to place a lion there so that he might be excused from going into
   the street. He did not want to get to his work and, therefore, there
   was a lion in the way to obstruct him! The lion was his friend. He had
   invented him on purpose to be the ally of his idleness. Yes, men will
   have their tongues busy and their imaginations busy, even though their
   hearts are idle and their hands are covered over with idle dirt. This
   man, using both his imagination and his tongue, gives me the
   opportunity of saying that he took great pains to escape from pains. He
   had to use his inventive ability to get himself excused from doing his
   duty.

   It is an old proverb that lazy people generally take the most trouble
   and so they do. And when men are unwilling to come to Christ it is very
   amazing what trouble they will take to keep away from Him. Hear how
   they argue. Mark their ingenuity in avoiding the narrow way! Oh, if
   they were to argue half as well upon the question why they should be
   saved as they do upon the question why they should not be saved, their
   logic would be put to a much more useful purpose! When we have talked
   with them, we have seen them invent all kinds of difficulties and
   doubts, disputes and dilemmas. They are always ready with hard
   doctrines and texts that are hard to understand. They seem as if they
   raked Heaven and earth and Hell to find reasons why they should be lost
   and yet the only reason that they have for this is they do not want to
   give up their sins--they do not want to give up their
   self-righteousness!

   They do not want to come to Jesus and be washed in His blood and owe
   everything to the charity of God through the Redeemer. They cannot be
   troubled with repenting and so they leave that doleful business, as
   they call it. They do not like to work out their own salvation with
   fear and trembling, and so they invent the lions. They do not care for
   faith; they do not delight in Christ; and so they invent difficulties
   and take a world of trouble to avoid trouble--storing up for
   themselves, hereafter, a heap of misery in order to escape from the
   blessedness of being found in Christ both now and at the Last Great
   Day.

   Now, in dealing with sluggishness and its vain excuse, my divisions,
   tonight, will be such that every child can take them home and remember
   them. The first head will be a lion. The second will be two lions. And
   the third will be no lions at all! Those three headings will surely
   abide in everybody's memory and they are fairly derived from the two
   texts.

   I. The first is "A LION." "The slothful man says, "There is a lion
   outside, I shall be slain in the streets." That is to say, it is time
   for him to get to the vineyard to work, but he does not get up and he
   pretends that he is best in bed, for there is a lion outside the door.
   Would you have him risk his precious life, so valuable to himself, at
   any rate, if to nobody else? He turns over upon his bed to sleep,
   again, for this is far more comfortable than to be meeting a lion and
   falling a prey to his teeth! He means, I think, that there is a great
   difficulty--a terrible difficulty--quite too much of a difficulty for
   him to overcome.

   He has heard of lion-tamers and lion-killers, but he is not one. He has
   not the strength and the vigor to attack this dreadful enemy! He will
   even confess that he has not sufficient courage for such an encounter.
   The terrible difficulty which he foresees is more than he can face--it
   is a LION and he is neither Samson, nor David, nor Daniel--and,
   therefore, he had rather leave the monster alone. Are there not many,
   here, who say much the same? "Oh," they say to the preacher, "you do
   not know our position, or the peculiar circumstances and special trials
   under which we labor! We would gladly be saved, but we cannot live as
   Christian men--our trade is a difficulty, our poverty is a difficulty,
   our lack of education is a difficulty--and the whole, put together,
   make up an impossibility. There is a lion in the way."

   Yes, I know, that is what your relative said many years ago. And as
   long as there is any of your family left, there will always be lions
   about--and you, being a true descendant of the slothful one, to speak
   honestly to you--can hear the lion roar under your window just as your
   great grandfather's grandfather did in Solomon's time! I am persuaded
   that your sons and daughters, if they have the same mind as you
   have--that is, a mind unwilling to come to Christ--will hear the voice
   of the lions, too! Wonderful difficulties will be in their way, as they
   are in yours. The ancient order of the Do-no-mores and the fruitful
   family of the Easys will keep their beds and their posts till the last
   trumpet shall sound!

   Though the promise is, "You shall tread upon the lion and adder: the
   young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet," they have no
   heart for the conflict and, therefore, never win a victory. Yes, but in
   this sluggard's case it was a very fierce lion. The Hebrew of the
   second text implies that it was a mighty lion that was in the street.
   His imagination pictured a very extraordinary monster, much larger than
   usual! And so, my dear Friends, you have some difficulty much greater
   than anybody else ever had--at least you talk as if this were the case!

   True, the martyrs swam through seas of blood to win the crown and
   thousands were burnt to ashes at the stake that they might be found
   faithful to Christ. But it would seem, from your talk, that those lions
   were nothing compared with your lion, which is of huge dimensions and
   extraordinary ferocity! What can this lion be? Perhaps if I were to
   examine a little closely it might come out that you are a great coward
   and the lion a wretched cur not worth noticing! Your lion is a mere
   mouse! Where is your manliness to tremble at so insignificant a trial?
   Perhaps you have an acquaintance who would be parted from you if you
   became a Christian. Is this your lion? It is a very young one! Or else
   you are following a bad trade and a bad business--and you know that you
   would have to give them up. Is this all?

   Your shop would have to be shut on Sunday--is this the secret of the
   matter? You know that the tricks that you now practice and that you
   find so profitable, you cannot practice if you become a Christian.
   Perhaps that is your lion. I should not wonder, though you try to make
   others believe that it is so terrible, that you really cannot tell what
   it is and yet you fondly dream that it quite excuses you for being what
   you are--an idle lie-abed, sleeping when the light of the Gospel is
   shining full in your face--and declining to decide for God and for
   Christ, though you know what the Lord requires of you.

   I wish that Elijah were here tonight that he might cry, as he did on
   Carmel, "If God is God, serve Him! If Baal is God, serve him. How long
   will you waver between two opinions?"--

   "Wake, you sleepers, wake! What mean you? Sin besets you round about,
   Up and search the foes within you Slay or chase the traitors out."

   Still you hesitate because this lion is such a terrible lion that there
   never was the like of it! In all the woods; in all the forests, never
   was there such a roaring beast as this! So you say, if you are wide
   awake enough to say as much as that. I tell you that you are trying to
   make yourself believe a lie, for your difficulties are no greater than
   many of us have surmounted by God's Grace! Your difficulties are not
   half as great as were those of Paul and of those who lived in his day

   who had to carry their lives in their hands--and seemed every day given
   over to death for Jesus Christ's sake--and yet bravely followed their
   Lord's will, notwithstanding all!

   Observe, again, that this sluggard said that there was a lion outside
   and he should be slain in the streets. It is rather a novel thing for
   people to be killed by lions in the streets. It has not occurred within
   my recollection and I do not think that it is ever likely to occur! But
   still, this man professed that he expected to be slain in the streets!
   In an age of liberty like this, he is afraid to be a Christian because
   of persecution, for persecution would be the death of him! Oh, dear! In
   a time like this, when, to be honest, to be upright is, for certain,
   the best thing for this world as well as for the world to come, yet men
   still tell us that they would lose by being Christians! It would ruin
   their business! They could never make a living! They would be slain in
   the streets.

   If you had lived in Madagascar years ago, when to be a Christian
   involved your being hurled down a precipice or being speared, I could
   see something in the excuse. But in a land like this, the persecutions
   which are endured may be bitter and the losses which are incurred may
   be heavy, but they are hardly worth mentioning as compared with the
   sufferings of the first ages! I reckon that the sufferings of this
   present time are not worthy to be compared with the sufferings of the
   past times--and much less with the Glory that shall be revealed in us.
   It will not do for you to talk so! It is idle talk! You do not believe
   it, yourself, though you whine like a coward, "I shall be slain in the
   streets." If you were half a man you would never fear the streets, or
   think it at all probable that a wild beast would pounce upon you there!

   And then look at the base conclusion--"There is a lion outside, I shall
   be slain in the streets," as if the lion would be sure to look for him
   if it did not meddle with anybody else--as if he were the only man in
   the street and not one among hundreds equally in danger--if such danger
   there really were. The lion, for certain, would kill him--he was quite
   sure of it--"I shall be slain in the streets." This is how sluggards
   talk, as if all the troubles and trials that ever fell upon men that
   are decided for Christ would fall upon them! And, whereas many of God's
   Daniels have lived in dens of lions and have been none the worse for
   it, they cannot look to Daniel's God--and they do not expect Daniel's
   rescue. They are sure that they shall be torn to pieces, though there
   is but one lion and that lion in the streets where there would be
   protection near and shelter at hand. If I met a lion at all, I should
   best like to meet his roaring majesty in the streets because there
   would probably be plenty of people at hand to help me. This
   consideration puts the case in a most ridiculous light. "Slain in the
   streets," when there will be others there more courageous than himself
   who will rush to his rescue!

   Now, look, you that talk about the difficulties of being Christians.
   Are there no other Christians besides you? Will you be the only
   Believers? When you are converted to God, will you be all alone? Will
   there be none to help you? Is there no Christian brotherhood left among
   us? Are there no advanced saints who will help you, as a young man, to
   struggle against your doubts and against the temptations that are in
   the way? Why, you know that you will not be alone in the streets of the
   Jerusalem of God! Once get into the City of God, which is His Church,
   and you will be safe, for "no lion shall be there, nor any ravenous
   beast shall go up thereon, but the redeemed of the Lord shall walk
   there"--and thus you shall be in the blessed company. You shall be in
   the place of safety when once you get into the streets of the City of
   our

   God!

   Still, it is after such manner that idle people talk. They imagine
   perils. They are in fear where no fear is, frightened at their own
   shadows, troubled with imaginary ills! The real lion, after all, is
   sluggishness, itself, aversion to the things of God. Oh, how many we
   have in the Tabernacle whom I have looked to see coming forward to
   profess their faith in Christ, but they have not come and, for all that
   I can see, they are just where they were 10, 12, 20 years ago! The real
   difficulty lies in this--their heart is not right towards God. They
   have not yet humbly acknowledged their need of Jesus--it is too much
   trouble to confess their sins. They have not yet accepted the Lord
   Jesus as God presents Him, as the Propitiation for sin. Oh, if they
   were in earnest about these things--if their hearts were really anxious
   to find Christ--they would not see this lion in the way! I am quite
   sure that the monster would soon disappear.

   Dear Friends, one very common species of lion is the plea of many that
   they cannot understand the way of salvation. Is that true? Then
   remember the text of last Sunday morning--"If our Gospel is hid, it is
   hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world has blinded
   their minds." It is an awful thing, then, to say, "I cannot understand
   it," for it proves that you are under the power of the devil! Another
   man says, "I cannot believe it." That is an equally dreadful thing to
   say. What is it? No. Who is it that you cannot believe? Can you not
   believe God? Is He a liar? Remember how John puts it and he is the most
   loving of all spirits--"He that believes not has made God a liar,
   because he has not be-

   lieved on His Son." It is a dreadful thing to say, "I cannot believe,"
   when God, who cannot lie, is the object of the remark!

   If you make such an observation to your fellow man you disgrace him.
   But if you say it to God, oh, how you dishonor Him! That excuse will
   not do! If Jesus speaks the Truth, why do you not believe Him? The
   Gospel is plain to the understanding of those who wish to know the
   Truth of God and it carries such evidence with it that it ought to be
   at once received without any excuse. Can you deny this? Then where is
   your lion? "But," says one, "if I did come to Christ, I am persuaded
   that after a little while I should fall back." Be not so sure of that!
   If you give your heart to Christ, has He not promised to keep you? Is
   it not written, "I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they shall
   never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of My hands"? Do you
   think that you are to keep yourself from falling? If so, read this
   doxology, and try to sing it--"Now unto Him that is able to keep you
   from falling, and to present you faultless before the Presence of God
   with exceeding joy--unto Him be Glory both now and forever."

   "Oh," says another, "but I know that a great many Christians are
   hypocrites!" This is your lion, is it? Well, if there are so many
   hypocrites, it is time that there should be one honest man--and why
   should not you be that one? Besides, what have you to do to call God's
   people hypocrites? You know that they are not! "Oh, but," you say,
   "they are full of faults: all of them are false." You do not dare say
   that, do you? If they all were false, nobody would want to be thought a
   Christian! How is it that a bad sovereign will pass? Why, because there
   are so many good ones and because good sovereigns are worth having--and
   the reason why a hypocrite passes through society is because there are
   so many genuine Christians to make him seem genuine--and it is a good
   thing to be a Christian! Instead of judging others, it is time that you
   sat and judged yourself, and that lion would soon be dead!

   "Yes, but I have tried," says one. Oh that is your lion, is it? But how
   did you try? You tried in your own strength, I know--and we do not
   invite you to do that any more--for your strength is perfect weakness!
   Had you committed yourself to the keeping of Christ, you would have
   another tale to tell and another song to sing, for He is faithful and
   He keeps those that are in His hands! If that is your lion, God grant
   that you may never hear it roar, again! You are not asked to save
   yourself, or keep yourself, but to submit yourself to the Grace of
   God--and surely that is able to keep you unto the end.

   I have this to say to you before I pass to my second head. If there is
   a lion outside, is there no lion within? That is to say, if you come to
   Christ and perish, you will most surely perish if you do not come to
   Him! If you live as you are, what must become of you? If you die as you
   are, what must be your lot? Without a Savior to wash you from sin and a
   Mediator to plead for you before God, what must be your eternal
   portion? Why, it would be better to go out among a thousand lions than
   to stay within and to perish in your sins! The lion within doors, in
   your case, will certainly destroy you! Therefore up and away! Escape as
   a bird out of the snare of the fowler--that fowler is Satan and his
   nets are the deceitfulness of sin.

   And what if there is a lion outside? Can you not fight it? If you ask
   the Lord to go with you, can you not contend with the lion and destroy
   him, even as David did? Saints of old have overcome through the blood
   of the Lamb! None of those who are in Heaven came there riding upon
   beds of ease, but--

   "They wrestled hard, as we do now,

   With sins and doubts, and fears."

   Do you expect to be carried into Heaven on a golden palanquin? You will
   be mightily mistaken! Did Jesus die on a Cross and are you to be
   crowned with roses?--

   "Must I be carried to the skies

   On flowery beds of ease?

   While others fought to win the prize,

   And sailed through bloody seas?" No, my Friend, there is no dainty road
   to Glory. If you are afraid of difficulty and self-denial, you judge
   yourself unworthy of the Kingdom. Remember, among the condemned, the
   fearful and unbelieving lead the van! Up and slay the lion, if a lion
   there is, and it shall be your joy to find honey in his carcass before
   long!

   If you do not feel that you can contend with the enemy--and certainly
   you cannot without Divine help--can you not cry for help? Our God hears
   and answers prayer! Why not cry to the Strong One for deliverance? Your
   lion is in the way. Shout, then, for a Friend to come and help you and
   with that call there stands One who is a wonderful lion-killer!

   There is the Son of David! Did He not destroy the works of the devil
   when He was here? Still He shows Himself strong for the defense of all
   them that put their trust in Him. Call to Him, "My Jesus, deliver me
   from the lion," and He will be with you and take the lion by the beard
   and slay him!

   Therefore, Sluggard, your excuses will not do. They are broken vessels
   that hold no water. God help you to be weary of them.

   II. We leave our friend, the sluggard, for a little while in the 22nd
   chapter of Proverbs, and we turn on three or four pages till we come to
   the 26th chapter, at the 13th verse. And there we find the gentleman
   again. The slothful man is still talking and he says, "There is a lion
   in the way; a lion is in the streets." Is there any difference between
   this verse and the first one that I took for my text? Yes, I think
   there is this difference--that there are TWO LIONS here instead of one.
   He has waited because of that one lion and now he fancies that there
   are two lions.

   He has made a bad bargain of his delay. He said that he would have a
   more convenient season, but where is it? It was inconvenient, then,
   because there was a lion. Is it more convenient now? Not at all, for
   now there are two lions. "There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the
   street." That is always the result of waiting--procrastination never
   profits--difficulties are doubled, dangers thicken. The countryman who
   had to cross the river foolishly determined to wait until the water had
   all gone past, for, at the rate it was going, he was quite sure that it
   must run dry. But when he had waited long, to his surprise he found
   that a flood had come down from the upland country and the river was
   much deeper than it had been before--the river was not dried, but
   swollen.

   Those who think, when they are young, that it will be so much more easy
   to seek and to find the Savior when they reach manhood, are greatly
   deceived. Those who think that they will wait till their family has
   grown up, or till they retire from business--for then they will be able
   to attend to it so much more easily--may live to discover that hardness
   of heart has come upon them as the result of delay. Life is like an
   evening--the longer you wait, the darker it becomes. Delay bristles
   with danger and the best fruit it can possibly bear is regret. When
   those who lingered are at last brought to Jesus, how much they wish
   that the precious years that had been wasted could come back to them!
   How heartily do they love that promise, "I will restore unto you the
   years which the locust has eaten"!

   I said last Sunday evening what I am sure is true--that our dear Savior
   knew the best time for the soul to come to Him. And what does the
   Spirit say is the best time? He says, "Today, if you will hear His
   voice, harden not your hearts." "Come now, and let us reason together,
   says the Lord." It is now that He gives the invitation, because now is
   the best time that is likely to come to us! You see in the second text
   there were two lions, and, according to the Hebrew, they were quite as
   bad as the other lion, for one of them was a young lion.

   "There is a young lion in the way." And the second Hebrew word implies
   a great lion. "A strong lion is in the streets." So now there were two
   active enemies--two unconquerable difficulties instead of one. And, as
   an old Puritan observes, the first time when the sluggard looked down
   the street and saw a lion lurking on the left, he could have gone the
   other way. But now when he looked out there was a lion to the right as
   well as to the left--and he could not go either way without facing a
   foe! With a lion at the front door and a lion at the back, there seemed
   to be no way of escape for him and this was the wretched result of
   waiting.

   And do not some of you who, years ago, hesitated over the difficulties
   of being a Christian, find more difficulties, now instead of less? When
   you were 21, you were deeply impressed and conscience was awakened. But
   you said, "No, not just now. It will be easier soon." Certain cords of
   sin held you. But now you are forty! Well, what about it? Are those
   cords weaker? I believe that now they are like cart ropes to bind you
   and, whereas sin once chastised you with whips, it is now chastising
   you with scorpions! You are getting farther away from the melting power
   of the Gospel, hardening to your own destruction! You can hear a
   sermon, now, and hear it without pricking of conscience.

   The tears used to flow, in years gone by, and you have gone out of this
   place feeling as if you never dared come into it, again, for the
   preacher had cut and torn you to pieces! He tries to preach just the
   same and he hopes that he does, but his words have not the same effect
   upon you, now, as in earlier days. You are Gospel-hardened! And that is
   the worst kind of hardening! You have heard the Gospel so long that
   there is no novelty in it and you know the excuses so well that you
   have got to be one of the devil's old soldiers, a veteran used to war!

   You know how to get over the Gospel, somehow. Like an old fox, you know
   all the traps and cannot be caught in them. You are sticking to the old
   trick about the lions, but now there are two lions, so you say. Thus
   you have a double-

   barreled excuse! How can I be so unreasonable as to expect you to come
   out often to a week-night service? You have three or four shops! How
   can you come out on a Sunday evening, some of you? You have
   half-a-dozen children! How is it possible that you should give much
   time to prayer? You are here, and there, and everywhere in your worldly
   calling! "Oh," you say, "do not talk to us! Years ago it might have
   been possible for us to be Christians, but now, how can it be?"

   Therefore, I say to you young people, hasten to be blest! I beseech you
   do not delay! An old man took a little child up into his arms and put
   his fingers into the abundant curls of his sunny hair, and he said,
   "Oh! Dear child, while your mother sings to you and tells you about
   Jesus, think of Him and trust Him." "Grandpa," said the little boy,
   "don't you trust Him?" "No, Dear," he said, "I might have done so years
   ago, but my old heart has got so hard, now, nothing ever touches me
   anymore." And the old man dropped a tear as he said it. "I wish," said
   he, "that I had a curly head like yours and was beginning life like
   you."

   Oh! Old man, are you here tonight? Let me tell you a secret! You may
   become a boy again! I am sure you may, for you may be born again! And
   he that is born again is but an infant and starts on a new life with
   freshly given strength! He shall have softer feelings than Nature lends
   to manhood! He shall have the feelings which Grace, alone, can produce!
   In a spiritual sense, his flesh shall come, again, unto him like that
   of a little child, though he cannot grow young again as to his bodily
   frame. The Holy Spirit can make him a new creature in Christ Jesus. But
   do not delay! Do not delay, you that are yet young! I am sure that
   Watts is right when he says--

   "'Tis easier work when we begin To serve the Lord early."

   It is assuredly so!

   Although Grace can bring in a person of any age, yet God delights to be
   found of them that seek Him early. It matters not who he may be--if any
   man comes to Jesus, he shall be received--but yet there is a
   susceptibility which pertains to the young which has often gone from
   those who, year after year, have heard the Gospel and yet have not
   yielded to its demands. Oh, I should like you who have two lions to
   frighten you to cry out to the Lord, tonight, to help you to go out and
   slay them both! "I am very old," you say. Well, that is one of the
   lions, but the Grace of God can make a sinner who is a hundred years
   old into a babe in Christ!

   "Oh, but I have formed such bad habits." Yes, those are horrible lions,
   but those habits can be broken by Divine power. "Ah, but my heart is so
   hard." Let it soak in the fountain filled with blood and that will
   soften it! The Spirit of

   God--

   "Can take the flint away

   That would not be refined, And from the riches of His Grace, Bestow a
   softer mind."

   He can take away the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a
   heart of flesh! Let us have done with the lions, whether there are two
   or 200, for the Lord will help us! Oh, for a lion hunt tonight!. Drive
   away the one and drive away the two! But that can never be while
   sluggards still are sluggards. The Lord quicken them and wake them up
   to real earnestness!

   III. That brings me to my last point, which is NO LION AT ALL. If there
   is a man here who would have Christ, there is no lion in the way to
   prevent his having Christ. "There are a thousand difficulties," says
   one. If you truly desire Christ, there is no effectual difficulty that
   can really block you from coming to Him. You notice that Solomon does
   not say that there were any lions in the way--he only tells us that the
   sluggard said so. Well, you need not believe a lazy man! The sluggard
   said it twice--but that did not make it true. Everybody knew what a
   poor fool he was and that it was only in his own imagination that there
   were any lions at all. Do not believe your sluggish self, then, and do
   not believe the sluggish speeches of others. There are no lions except
   in your own imagination!

   John Bunyan pictures lions at the gate of the interpreter's house and,
   according to some commentators, he meant the deacons and elders of the
   Church that are outside to watch those who desire to join the Church. I
   am one of those horrible lions--but the happy thought is that the lions
   are chained! Whenever you wish to join the Church, if you will only
   have courage to come and face us who are the dreadful lions in front of
   the palace gate, you will find that we are chained! And, what is more,
   if we were not chained, we would not harm you! We try to roar at those
   who are not our Master's

   children and we would drive away all who come as thieves and robbers,
   for it is our duty to do so--but if you have a true heart and wish to
   cast in your lot with the Lord's people--you shall not find that we are
   any terror to you!

   We shall be glad to say, "Come in, you blessed of the Lord. Why are you
   standing outside?" A Believer's duty is to join a Christian
   Church--therefore fear not the face of man! I believe that some will
   never come to Christ until another and a real lion shall get at them.
   And then they will run to Jesus for shelter, lions or no lions! I mean
   if the lions of their sin should ever wake up and roar upon them,
   terribly, then they will not say that there are lions in the way! I
   used to be terribly afraid to come to Christ until I came to be more
   afraid of my sin than anything else in the world!

   And Mr. Bunyan, in one of his books, says that lion pictured Christ in
   his own mind as standing with a drawn sword to keep him away. "But at
   last," he says, "I got so desperately worried by my convictions of sin
   that if the Lord Jesus had really stood with a sword in His hand, I
   would have thrown myself upon the point of it, for I felt that I must
   come at Him or perish." Let some such desperate resolve impel you to
   His feet. Say--

   "I can but perish if I go!

   Iam resolved to try

   For if I stay away,

   I know I must forever die."

   Oh, throw yourself on the very point of the sword, for it is but in
   seeming that there is either sword or point! Hasten to Jesus, even
   though He seems to frown, for there is more love in a frowning Savior
   than in all the world besides! He cannot mean it. No sinner comes to
   Him but Christ is more glad to receive him than the sinner is to be
   received!

   Nothing charms Jesus like seeing a poor troubled one come to Him. He
   will in no wise cast out one who does so. If you were walking in the
   fields and a poor bird should fly into your bosom for shelter from a
   hawk, would you take it out of your bosom and throw it away and give it
   up to its enemies? I know that you would not! You would put your hands
   about it, and say, "Poor fluttering thing, you are safe enough, now.
   Nobody shall harm you. You have trusted a man that has humanity and he
   will take care of you." And if you fly into the bosom of Jesus Christ,
   He will not give you over to your foe, but He will receive you and you
   shall be His forever!

   I have heard of a king upon the crown of whose pavilion, when it was
   pitched, a pair of birds came and built their nests. And he was gentle
   of heart and truly royal, for he said to his chamberlain, "The tent
   shall never be taken down till the birds have hatched their young. They
   have found shelter in a king's pavilion and they shall not have to rue
   it." And oh, if you will go like the swallows and the sparrows--and
   build your nests under the eaves of Christ, who is the Temple of
   God--you shall never have your nest pulled down! Yes, and if you can
   lay your young there, they shall be safe, too. There is no place half
   so secure for our children as Christ's bosom! All who are in Christ
   shall be kept in safety and shall be cherished and blessed!

   Oh, come along with you! Come, you that are afraid of lions! There are
   no lions! The way is clear and open, for Jesus says, "I am the Way,"
   and, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." Why do you
   still say that you will come by-and-by? Do not trifle so! I had almost
   rather that you cried, "I will not come at all!" Such perversity might
   end better than feigned promises and base delays. I pray God to give
   you a better mind than that and may you say, "Yes, this very night,
   please God, I will be saved! The sun has gone down, but there is a
   little twilight left, and I will yield before darkness quite sets in. I
   will now trust my Savior and hasten to Him and seek Him on my knees in
   prayer."

   May the Spirit of God sweetly lead you to do this and, oh, our heart
   will be so glad of it! The Lord grant it, for His dear name's sake.
   Amen.

The Value and Rank of the Believer

   (No. 1671)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honorable, and I
   have loved you: therefore will I give men for you, and people for your
   life." Isaiah 43:4.

   ONE of the worst mistakes we could make would be to judge our condition
   before God by our outward circumstances. Know you not that the ungodly
   have their portion in this life? They increase in riches; their eyes
   stand out with fatness; they have more than heart can wish. They are
   not in trouble like other men, "neither are they plagued like other
   men," therefore pride compasses them about as a chain; violence covers
   them as a garment. Poor creatures, they have no joy in the world to
   come and, therefore, God permits them to have as much joy as they are
   capable of in this world. They stand upon slippery slopes and fiery
   billows rage below! How are they cast down as in a moment! They are
   utterly consumed with terrors!

   Envy them not and never dream that they are beloved of God because,
   like the beast which is fattened for the slaughter, their manger is
   full of corn and their rack is overflowing with fodder. As for the
   people of God, they are often in great trials. David said of himself,
   "All the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morning"--as
   if his heavenly Father whipped him as soon as he was up and kept him
   under the rod all day long. Such chastisements are not unusual in the
   family of Grace. Many of God's best servants are rich in faith, but
   extremely poor in pocket. They are strong in the Lord, but sadly weak
   in body. They are beloved of Heaven, but abhorred by the men of the
   world.

   Many of those whom the Lord loves most, endure sharp affliction, even
   as the most precious metal is likely to see the most of the fire. Is it
   not written, "As many as I love I rebuke and chasten"? "What son is
   there whom his father chastens not?" The Lord scourges every son whom
   He receives. Therefore, never judge yourselves by outward
   circumstances, for these are not the balances of the sanctuary and
   cannot help you to a just conclusion as to your state before God!
   Everything may seem to go against you and yet all things may be working
   together for your good. Jacob was no good judge of his own matters when
   he cried, "All these things are against me!" He needed Egypt and a
   sight of Joseph to teach him the reason for the Lord's dealings.

   Everything may be prospering with you openly and yet you may only be as
   the victim which is covered with garlands when it is being led to be
   slain at the altar. Everything may be grieving you and yet securing
   your best prosperity. Our Heavenly Father has, I think, given us the
   words of the text and the context by way of comfort in reference to His
   outward dispensations. If God has a favored people whom He has
   chosen--upon whom His distinguishing Grace has lighted to make them
   great and honorable--you would suppose that the second verse of this
   chapter would run thus, "You shall not go through the waters, for I
   will be with you to keep you out of them; neither shall you pass
   through the rivers, for I have bridged them on your behalf. You shall
   never go through the fire and, therefore, you shall not be burned.
   Neither shall there be any fear that the flame shall kindle upon you,
   for it shall not come near you."

   There is no such word of promise! It would be contrary to the whole
   tenor of the Covenant, which always speaks of a rod and of the chosen
   passing under it! On the contrary, it is here supposed and taken for
   granted that we shall have to pass through fire and through water to
   get to Heaven! And it is put thus--"When you pass through the waters, I
   will be with you: when you walk through the fire, you shall not be
   burned." And then it comes in, in the language of our text, that
   although the chosen are bound to go through fire and through water, yet
   they are precious in God's sight. Oh true Believer, rest in perfect
   peace! Although you have to pass through unnumbered afflictions, you
   are honorable and safe, for the Lord will make any sacrifice so that He
   may secure your safety!

   He will give all mankind for you, for the word is in the plural, "I
   will give men for you." And He will give all things, yes, whole nations
   of men, for you, sooner than you shall perish, so determined is He that
   you shall be saved! Come, then,

   dear tried people of God--come to the text and see whether you can find
   comfort in it! I know you will not be disappointed if the Holy Spirit,
   the Comforter, shall apply it with power to your souls.

   I. First, THE LORD COUNTS HIS PEOPLE TO BE PRECIOUS. The text was
   spoken of a nation whom He had chosen and what is true of a nation is
   true of each individual in that nation--at least, what is true of
   Israel is true of every Israelite. If God has loved His Church, He has
   loved every member of that Church. And if His Church is precious in His
   sight, so is each individual Believer. Is not that a blessed word, "You
   were precious in My sight"? In your own sight you appear to be
   unworthy, insignificant and undeserving, but you are precious in the
   sight of the Lord!

   I know that when the Lord gives us a soul-humbling experience, we are
   made to feel as if we were worthless worms, good-for-nothing,
   incapable, ungrateful, undeserving, ill-deserving, Hell-deserving. "God
   be merciful to me a sinner," is often the cry of the most sanctified
   child of God. Yes, and the nearer he gets to the likeness of Christ,
   the more he mourns over his deficiencies, till he is like David who had
   spoken all through the 119th Psalm of his love to God's Word and his
   delight in it--and yet concluded the Psalm by saying--"I have gone
   astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant; for I do not forget Your
   Commandments," as if that were the conclusion of the whole matter and
   the utmost to which he had attained.

   Only the ignorant and self-exalted will talk of their own goodness!
   Saints mourn because they perceive sin remaining in them. The Divine
   assurance of our text comes in as a blessed counterbalance to our lowly
   sense of our own worthless-ness. The Lord, Himself, bears witness, "You
   are precious in My sight." A child of God is often far other than
   precious in the sight of others. Men of God are often as broken
   pitchers in the sight of men, only fit to be thrown away. If they
   become earnest, people say that they are almost out of their minds
   through religion. If they are quiet, their critics remark that they are
   moping and melancholy. Nothing you can do will altogether please men of
   the world--they are sure to pick holes in your coat one way or
   another--it is the way of them.

   We are not precious in their sight, for they value glitter, pomp,
   riches and the things which perish in the using. They can do without
   Christians, so they think. Albeit that the people of God are the very
   salt of the earth and the light of the world, yet they are utterly
   despised and rejected. "The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine
   gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands
   of the potter!" Ah, well! Child of God, you are precious in God's sight
   and that is infinitely more than being precious to princes! You live in
   a little room, alone, and few know you. And those who do know you do
   not think much of you, but the Lord says, "You are precious in My
   sight." Poor old Mary, who has been bed-ridden for years, fears that
   her friends think her a burden, but let her be comforted, for her best
   Friend says, "You are precious in My sight."

   John, the carter, with his large family, small wages and shabby
   clothes, yet fears the Lord and walks with Him! And no man may despise
   him, for to the Lord he is worth more than his weight in gold, and his
   Redeemer says, "You are precious in My sight." A humble working man has
   come to worship with the Lord's people, all unknown to fame. He has
   only one talent, which he tries to use, and he is often downcast
   because he can do so little for his Master. Yet the Lord says, "You are
   precious in My sight." And is it not better to be precious in the sight
   of God than it would be to be precious in the sight of kings and queens
   and the great ones of the earth? May you not be well content, like your
   Redeemer, to be unknown and despised, if the Lord does but say, "You
   are precious in My sight"?

   Do you know, sometimes, these words of our Lord quite take me aback? It
   is so wonderful that I should be precious to the All-Glorious Jehovah!
   I remember being startled, once, when that word in Solomon's Song came
   with power to my soul--"You are all fair, My Love; there is no spot in
   you." It shone so brightly on my soul that it seemed to give a
   sunstroke to my faith and I almost whispered, "I cannot believe it."
   Yet it is even so! We know how lovers will exaggerate and use
   hyperboles in their expressions, but the Lord our God speaks not after
   the fashion of foolish men! He is seriously in earnest in all that He
   says.

   But still, I was set wondering. Could it be that Jesus could speak thus
   in His infinite love to me? I needed to remember the power of the
   washing in His blood, and the power of His cleansing Spirit, and the
   power of His justifying righteousness before I could understand how He
   could say such a word to me. Do you not feel a bit staggered as you
   hear this word, "You are precious in My sight"? Does not unbelief
   prompt you to say, "Lord, that love-word is meant for somebody else! It
   cannot mean me." And yet, if you believe that Jesus is the Christ, you
   are born of God, and it is to you that this text is spoken, "You are
   precious in My sight."

   How can this be? I think the text explains it. Read the first verse.
   "But now thus says the Lord that created you, O Jacob, and He that
   formed you, O Israel." It is clear that we are precious to God because
   we are His creation. The first creation was marred upon the wheel by
   sin. It became a thing without honor and came under the curse. But he
   that believes in Jesus has been created anew by the work of the Holy
   Spirit. God has, in a very special sense, created him. He has gone
   beyond mere creation--having first created the clay--He has formed it.
   We are not half-made or ill-made in regeneration--we are formed as well
   as created! The Lord who has given us spiritual existence is daily
   giving us fashion and completeness. Having first given us life, He has
   tutored that life. Having planted the tree, He has pruned it. He has
   created us and formed us and, in both, He has worked according to the
   counsel of His own will.

   In the beginning God made the heavens and the earth, but afterwards the
   first chapter of Genesis tells us how God fitted up the heavens and the
   earth to be man's abode, forming what He had, before, created. The
   earth, though long before created, was "without form and void; and
   darkness was upon the face of the deep." In the moment of regeneration
   we are like that newly-created world, but as by the Lord's power the
   world was brought into light and order, so by Divine Grace the work of
   sanctification goes on, stage by stage, till Christ is formed in us and
   we are formed in His image!

   Now, because the Lord has done a great work upon us equal to a creation
   and a formation, therefore we are precious in His sight. How a man will
   love a garden when he has laid it out himself! How he will admire the
   fruit that comes from trees which he planted with his own hands, years
   ago, and to which he has attended, himself! When we see our work in
   anything, it has great value in our eyes. Work is a great creator of
   preciousness. You know how a little piece of metal, which intrinsically
   may be scarcely of any worth, can have such work put into it that from
   half a farthing it can rise in worth to hundreds of pounds. Skilled,
   artistic work makes the most common material to be as precious as a
   gem.

   Think, then, of what the Lord has worked upon us! We who seemed to be
   intrinsically so worthless have the workmanship of God upon us, for,
   "He that has worked us to the same thing is God," and by that
   workmanship, that creation, that formation, He has made us to be very
   precious things. From an old horseshoe the artificer may make a work of
   rarest workmanship and thus has the Lord done with us! Though we were
   like the common pebbles that lay in Jordan's brook, the Lord has of
   those stones raised up children unto Abraham! Though we were but as the
   dross that is cast out at the pit's mouth, to be left there as
   worthless, yet the Lord has taken us up and transformed us into silver
   and gold, that we may make a crown for Himself, world without end! Has
   He not said "This people have I formed for Myself; they shall show
   forth My praise"? Oh, but this is sweetly clear and, surely, the
   creative work of God upon us has made us to be precious in His sight!

   But what does He say next? "I have formed you: I have redeemed you." I
   wish I could sit down in that chair and let somebody else talk of this
   most Divine subject. Here is the reason why we are precious in the
   sight of the Lord--it is because we have been bought with precious
   blood! Can we contemplate the sufferings and the death of Christ for us
   without feeling that whatever He intended to accomplish by such
   sufferings and death must be an objective most precious in His sight,
   an objective that He will certainly achieve? Some seem to fancy that
   Christ either had no purpose at all in His death, or else that He
   played at haphazard, redeeming all men, or no men, as the chance might
   happen to turn out. They say that He was a Substitute for all men, and
   yet it is clear that many of them are lost--lost, though redeemed with
   His precious blood!

   I am loath to repeat the statement, though to them it does not appear
   to be profane. I know this--I would not willingly give my life on a
   speculation! I must be well convinced that a grand result will
   certainly follow, or I will not even risk my life if I can help it. And
   I cannot conceive the infinitely wise God, our Savior, as laying down
   His life for any purpose but that which will most certainly be
   accomplished! What He bought, He will have. What He purchased, He will
   receive. If a thing is bought with your money, it becomes precious to
   you! And though it may be a bad bargain, yet if it cost you dearly, you
   do not intend to lose it. You value it too much to throw away that
   which has cost you so dearly. And Christ has not thrown His blood away,
   or wasted it, or spilt it on the ground for nothing! He shall see of
   the travail of His soul!

   Come back to a view of yourself. Have you believed in Jesus? Then you
   know, by that mark, that He has redeemed you from among men! Do you
   believe in Jesus? Then you are of His sheep! Christ laid down His life
   for His sheep. Do you believe? Then you belong to His Church of which
   we read, "Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it." You see
   the specialty of His redemption as coming to those of you who believe
   in Him, therein you have the key of our text. Now

   you can understand why you are precious--redemption makes you so. "I
   bought that woman," says Christ. "Amidst my pangs and groans and death
   I saw her--saw her through the tears that filled My eyes. I also saw
   that man--My prescient love beheld him in his sin and beheld him as
   redeemed from them when I bore his sin in My own body on the tree."

   Oh, blessed thought! We must be precious to Him who has not only
   created us, but has laid down His life for us, "the Just for the
   unjust, that He might bring us to God." The agony and bloody sweat
   cause me to understand my Lord's saying, "You were precious in My
   sight." In any case, the Spirit of God in our text assures us that such
   is the fact--we are precious unto God--the jewels of His crown, the
   apple of His eye, the portion of His possession.

   Another blessing of Grace is mentioned in the chapter and that is that
   God has called us. "I have called you by your name; you are Mine."
   There is a work of Grace called Effectual Calling, by which the Spirit
   of God calls out the redeemed from among men. They lie with the rest of
   the fallen mass, knowing nothing about what Christ has done for
   them--ignorant, indifferent, insensible. But Free Grace calls them out
   from the mass of the dead! Many calls are given to them in the
   Gospel--to them amongst others--indeed, to all men, for the call is to
   all the sons of men. But they regard not the invitation. Even the elect
   refuse the voice of the Lord till God, in Sovereign Grace, puts power
   into the Word-- and then it comes as a personal call--as it is written,
   "I have called you by your name."

   Then the summons of love comes effectually and they are made willing in
   the day of the Lord's power. Being effectually called, they
   spontaneously answer, "When You said, Seek you My face, my heart said
   unto You, Your face, Lord, will I seek." Jesus knows when He called
   you--do you remember it? Some of us remember it as distinctly as ever
   the two sons of Zebedee recollected when Jesus called them as they were
   fishing and promised to make them fishers of men. The day is as
   distinct to us, now, as it must have been to Matthew when he sat at the
   receipt of custom and Jesus said unto him, "Follow Me." We have been
   called, as surely called as the child Samuel when he was upon his bed,
   for our spiritual ears have heard the voice of God and our hearts have
   answered, "Here am I; for You did call me."

   Yes, Beloved, we know our calling, and it is well for us to be fully
   assured that, therefore, we are precious in the sight of the Lord!
   Effectual calling has made us so! He drew us and we followed. He called
   us and we answered to the call. Therefore are we dear to the Father to
   whom we have returned; dear to Jesus by whom we have been reconciled;
   and dear to the Holy Spirit who has led us into this Grace. We have
   been ever since kept by His rich Grace and preserved--and this, also,
   has endeared us to the Lord. Those to whom we have shown great favor
   are sure to be dear to us. We love those to whom we have acted
   lovingly. The Lord has daily called us from one stage of Grace to
   another. "Friend, come up higher," is a word that we hear from time to
   time and we expect to hear it, soon, for the last time when He shall
   bid us rise from earth to Heaven. Then will He say, "Friend, come up
   higher, and we shall sit down in the highest room." He is always
   calling and, by His Grace, enabling us to answer the call and,
   therefore, we are precious in His sight.

   But I do not care so much to think over the reasons as I wish to get
   you to grip the truth, each one of you on his own account. Perhaps you
   are downtrodden and despised, oppressed and depressed. Is your spirit
   sinking within you? If so, rejoice that you are precious to God! You
   are nobodies, so the world says, and so you think, but, for all that,
   the Lord declares that you are precious in His sight! Now, will you try
   to think that many and many a poor soul that as yet knows not Christ is
   as precious in His sight as you are? They are His sheep, though not yet
   the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hands--

   "Oh, come! Let us go and find them, In the paths of death they roam."

   Let us go and hunt up the lost jewels which belong to Jesus! All the
   treasures hid in a field have not yet been found. God has a chosen
   people in the back slums, in the lowest haunts of vice--let us go forth
   and seek them. "I have much people in this city," He said to Paul, and
   I believe that He has much people hidden away in the holes and corners
   of London! If poor fallen men and women are precious in His sight,
   though they may be the offscouring of the streets--though they may be
   thieves and drunks--let us never despise them! Let us never say, "Oh, I
   cannot be associated with such!" "Precious in My sight," says Jesus, as
   He points to them. "Precious in My sight," as He points to the poor
   fallen woman. "Precious in My sight," as He mourns over the blasphemer.
   Go after the degraded haunter of the street and never rest until you
   have the happiness of bringing her to Him who bought you and bought her
   with His most precious blood!

   Brothers and Sisters, do you not think that if you are precious in
   Christ's sight, then everything that has to do with Him ought to be
   precious to you? Oh, how you should value Christ! Is He not your
   All-in-All? Everything that is con-

   nected with Him ought to become dear to you! Some of His people are
   very disagreeable people and we cannot feel much joy in their company,
   but we must still love them. Remember what Augustine said--he declared
   that he loved every man that had "a liquid Christi"--anything of
   Christ--about him. "Precious in My sight," says Christ of this Brother
   and that! Let them, then, be precious to you and be it your joy to
   cheer them and succor them for Jesus Christ's sake! Think once more. If
   you are precious in God's sight, do not despise yourself so as to fall
   into the follies and vanities which please other men. The ungodly may
   do as they please, but here is a charming check for you--Jesus says of
   you-- "Precious in My sight."

   Then, Lord, I cannot go into amusements which some others so much
   delight in, for if You have said, "Precious in My sight," I cannot be
   found among the giddy throng. If there is a sin that once was sweet to
   me and I find it to be sweet to many of my friends, I will abstain from
   it with all my heart and try to get them to do so, also, since You have
   taught me that I am precious in Your sight. Nobility has its
   obligations. We do not dream of seeing princes of the blood running in
   the streets and playing with the children of the gutter. No, something
   better is expected of them! If you are precious in God's sight, let the
   obligations of discriminating Grace lie upon you! Maintain a holy
   separation from the world! Heirs of Heaven, behave as such! Children of
   the eternal King, remember the dignity of your condition and so walk
   that you live not inconsistently with what the Lord has done for you!

   That is our first point. In the Lord's esteem His people are precious.

   II. Now, secondly, they being precious, He adds another epithet. "Since
   you were precious in My sight, YOU HAVE BEEN HONORABLE." Is not that
   another blessed word? Alas, how many of God's people were the reverse
   of honorable before they knew the Lord! Many a dishonorable thing they
   thought, said and did, and it is the dishonorable life that makes the
   dishonorable man. They are honorable, now, but possibly they were
   children of shame at their birth. Perhaps they lived in sins that are
   not to be mentioned lest the cheek of modesty should crimson--and yet
   they are now honorable! Perhaps they went so deep in sin that the laws
   of their country convicted them of crime and yet--wonder of Divine
   Grace--as soon as ever they are precious in God's sight they are
   honorable!

   All the past is blotted out! It shall be remembered against them no
   more, forever! They take their rank among the honorable. I do not know
   that I should care to be called, "right honorable," among men, for
   there are too many "right honorable" whom we could not honor, patrons
   of the race course, the betting ring and the prizefight. The name is a
   falsehood when applied to debauched men whose only worth lies in their
   money. But an, "honorable," that God calls honorable is honorable,
   indeed! Although, previously, that poor soul may have been everything
   that was dishonorable, Jesus says, "I have blotted out your sins like a
   cloud, and like a thick cloud, your iniquities"--and that free pardon
   puts him among the honorable!

   Those who trust the Lord Jesus are honorable, "for unto you that
   believe he is honor." The meanest child of God that lives is honorable,
   for he belongs to a right worshipful family. An angel thinks it an
   honor to wait upon him, bearing him up in his hands lest he dash his
   foot against a stone. "Honorable!" Why, all Nature honors the elect of
   God! The saints of God are the center of all Providential arrangements.
   Next to God, for the Church all things exist, for so the Lord has put
   it, "He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the
   children of Israel." "And all things work together for good to them
   that love God." The stones of the field shall be in league with them
   and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with them.

   The Lord gives a charge to all the powers of Nature that they are on
   the side of the man who is on the side of God. Honorable? Why, we are
   the most conspicuous objects of the Divine forethought from all
   eternity--the most esteemed subjects of the guardian care of Heaven in
   all time--and we shall be the most eminent objects of Divine love
   throughout a whole eternity when the Lord shall make known, through the
   Church, to wondering angels and principalities, the manifold wisdom of
   God. "Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honorable."

   Now let a poor child of God tell how he believes that he is honorable.
   First, dear Brothers and Sisters, we are honorable by birth. Some are
   proud because they have been born of fathers who have been made lords,
   or elevated to the peerage in years gone by, thus by birth they are
   honorable--that is the way people talk and it must be so among men as
   long as there are classes and ranks. Descended from the King of kings,
   each saint has a lineage before which the pedigrees of princes grow
   stale and mean! He that is "begotten, again, unto a lively hope by the
   Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." He that is born of the
   Spirit of God--he into whom God has infused His own Nature--he is
   honorable by birth

   in a sense which none can dispute! Not by blood, but by the new birth
   which comes from the Spirit of God, every child of God is made both
   precious and honorable.

   Next, we become honorable by our possessions, for men pay honor to
   those who become millionaires and are immensely rich. Alas, the gains
   may have been dishonorably made and then the honor that comes of wealth
   is a stench in the nostrils of good men and angels. But, Brethren, our
   wealth that we get by our new birth is such that we are richer than the
   wealthiest of worldlings and must, in consequence, be honored! Paul
   says, "All things are yours--whether things present, or things to come,
   or life, or death. All are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is
   God's." What an estate is that which belongs to every heir of Heaven,
   for we are "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ," and thus we
   become, indeed, honorable.

   Yes, and the child of God becomes honorable in rank. To be a child of
   God is to occupy a rank surpassing all human dignity. A child of God is
   a "prince of the blood imperial," I was about to say, but, still better
   than that, he is a prince of the Divine line--he is a child of God! No
   dignity can excel this. One who is a child of God has a rank which he
   could not wish to change though all the empires in the world should lie
   at his feet to tempt him with their glories. Beloved, we, then, become
   ennobled by our relationship. When a person is related to some great
   man, he has a degree of honor reflected upon him. It may be by marriage
   that the relationship is made, but it is all the same. Honor comes with
   honorable connections. Since, then, we are related to God by the
   spiritual birth and united to Christ by the spiritual marriage, we are
   partakers of the honor of God our Savior!

   Beloved, we are now the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we
   shall be, but we know that when Jesus shall appear we shall be like He
   is. Jesus is, "the first-born among many brethren" and we, as the
   younger brethren, are all honorable! We are honorable by calling, for
   He "has made us kings and priests unto our God." And these among men
   are the most noteworthy of all callings. None more honorable than
   priests and kings of God's own making! By Divine Grace we have become
   honorable by character, for the Lord has sanctified His people and made
   them to love that which is good and right and to forsake that which is
   evil. By His Grace they shall no longer bear the fruits of the flesh,
   but the fruits of the Spirit shall be in them and abound! And so, being
   honorable according to God's calling, they shall become honorable by a
   conversation agreeing therewith. Theirs is an honorable life--they live
   for an honorable purpose, they are quickened by an honorable
   spirit--they are wending their way through an honorable destiny on
   earth to Glory and honor and immortality and life eternal! Therefore
   may they rejoice that God has made them honorable.

   The lesson to be learned from it is, do not let any child of God be
   bashful, shamefaced and cowardly in the presence of men of the world.
   It becomes us to be lowly and meek with all humbleness of mind, but not
   with any kind of meanness, so that we would flatter the great, or
   cringe before the powerful. We are greater than they, for they know not
   the Lord and he is greatest who knows best the Great One. Why should we
   fear their threats? Who are we that we should be afraid of a man that
   must die? Who are we? We ought to feel ourselves to be too honorable to
   fear the son of man who is crushed before the moth. "Princes did sit
   and speak against me," said David, "yet I declined not from Your
   statutes."

   Who are princes? If they speak against God's children, they speak
   against those who are more honorable than they! They revile their
   superiors, compared with whom they are but mimic monarchs. Do not,
   therefore, go about with the bearing of a menial, but with the air of a
   king! I would like to walk as Abraham did among men. He was every inch
   a king--the sons of Heth could do no other than respect the princely
   Patriarch. Poor Jacob is often beggarly with his bargains and his
   tricks--he cuts a sorry figure as compared with his majestic grandsire,
   the Father of the Faithful. Abraham so trusts his God that he is the
   independent man everywhere--he lends, but be does not borrow. He is the
   head, but not the tail. When he stands before the king of Sodom, how
   more than royal his bearing!

   The king would give him the spoils which were, indeed, justly his
   according to the laws of war, but he replies, "I will not take from a
   thread even to a shoelace, lest you should say, I have made Abram
   rich." The child of God is too honorable to take what other people
   would take, if, thereby, he would stain his dignity. He may often feel
   it unbecoming his dignity to do that which is lawful. He may,
   therefore, choose a more excellent way. Lions will not be found
   stealing little bits of meat like cats, or feeding on carrion like
   dogs. It is not for eagles to hawk for flies and it is not for children
   of God to stoop below the glorious level of their new birth! "Since you
   were precious in My sight, you have been honorable." Oh, you right
   honorable, take care to act honorably!

   My Brothers, we do not wish to be called, "reverend," any one of us.
   but God has called us honorable and it would be a fairer title by far
   for us to wear! Reverence, surely, we can never claim--that belongs but
   to One. But if He calls us, "honorable," I venture at least to call
   you, "right honorable." O you right honorable, always live as right
   honorable! Do not let us hear of you, that you spoke in a fit, for that
   is to act like a spoiled child. One of God's honorable in a passion,
   uttering burning words? This will never do! One of God's children
   doubting God, afraid to trust his heavenly Father and trying, by little
   tricks of trade to get on, instead of being honest? Is this a
   conversation such as becomes the household of faith? Is not this the
   reverse of what becomes us?

   There is one that cannot forgive his brother--is that seemly? He will
   not speak to his friend because of some small offense--is that
   honorable? Some that profess to be God's children seem to think it a
   poor business to be a Christian! Brothers and Sisters, think not so!
   Have a high idea of what a Christian ought to be and then pray the
   Spirit of God to raise you up to it! If you have been called a king in
   the Eternal Covenant, I pray that you may be anointed to your office
   with a horn of oil by the Divine Spirit and that about you there may be
   regal qualities such as become a king--and a sacrificial life such as
   befits a priest--for God has, indeed, made you to be a king and a
   priest unto Him!

   III. Be of good cheer, then, as you pass on to the third point. "Since
   you were precious in My sight, you have been honorable, AND I HAVE
   LOVED YOU." Ever since the Lord has manifested Himself to you, He has
   loved you manifestly. He has not only told you of His love in the
   secret of your soul, but He has publicly acted in love to you. I desire
   you to get that Truth of God fully into your mind. Ever since the time
   of your conversion--yes, and long before that--ever since He loved you,
   He has acted in love to you.

   "Oh, but I have been very ill. I have been frequently bound to my couch
   and my bed has been as painful to me as though it were of red-hot
   iron." Yes, yes, but He has loved you and put you to that pain to
   glorify Himself and to benefit you by preparing you to receive more of
   His love and to manifest more of it to others! "Since you were precious
   in My sight, I have loved you." Is there not a well of delight in that
   assurance? "Oh, but I have been in the dark as to my Lord. I have not
   walked in the light of His Countenance and He has hidden Himself from
   me. I have had many questions in my conscience as to my condition
   before Him."

   Just so, because He loved you He would not let you be happy unless you
   were in a right state before Him. And He has put you in the dark
   because you were not fit to be in the light. He loved you and He saw
   you to be a naughty child and, therefore, He resolved that you must be
   put in the corner. The Father could not smile, for to be smiled on by
   God when we are indulging in sin would be a curse to us--not a
   blessing! Our Father loves us too much to let us be at ease in sin!
   Will you try to remember that the Lord has loved you and kept on loving
   you all these years and He has never thought an unloving thought
   towards you? Nor has He done an unloving action towards you in any
   shape or form. He has looked out for wise ways in which to exhibit His
   love to you and He has done the very best for you. He has loved you
   infinitely-- His whole heart has been set upon you.

   The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout all the earth to show
   Himself strong on the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards
   Him. God loves you as much as if there were not another saint for Him
   to love! Can you believe that? God puts the center of His love in
   Christ and if there is any other center of His love, you are in it
   because God is a circle whose center is everywhere and whose
   circumference is nowhere--and you and I and each one of us may thus be
   the actual center of the love of God in Christ Jesus! Although there
   are ten thousand times ten thousand of my Brothers and Sisters for God
   to love, He does not mean to love me any the less. If I have so many to
   love, I must cut my heart in pieces, but His great heart is so
   capacious that He gives the whole of it to you and the whole of it to
   me! Even as the Father loved the Son, so does He love His people.

   Jesus says, "As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Continue
   you in My love." He is loving you now. The great Father is looking down
   upon you with infinite delight and boundless affection at this instant.
   Cheer up, then! Cheer up! Let nothing distress you. Did I hear you
   complaining that you are all alone? Are your father and mother dead?
   Perhaps years ago. The friends that you have been living with have been
   taken away and you are friendless and alone. Some of us who have got to
   middle life, or past it, see our dear old friends going to Heaven in
   flocks! We sometimes wonder what we shall do for friends when we grow
   old, ourselves, if we are spared! But that is a sweet word, "When your
   father and your mother forsake you, then the Lord will take you up."
   "Even to your old age I am yours and even to hoar

   hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will
   carry, and will deliver you." Is God thus loving us? Then it is enough!
   Let us fall back upon that love and say, "Your love, my Lord, is all I
   can desire."

   Well, now, if God loves us so, shall we not love Him? Awake, O heart
   that sleeps! Awake, awake, and give back to God all the love of which
   you are capable! And shall we not love poor sinners for Christ's sake?
   Shall we not try to love them to the Savior? The greatest converting
   power in the world, next to the Holy Spirit, is the power of human
   love. Men are never saved by scolding and an angry preacher is not
   likely to bring many to a loving Savior. We must love sinners so much
   that they must be saved, or we will break our hearts! When we get to
   that, God will make us to be instruments in His hands of gathering in
   His chosen. Let us turn into flames of love! Oh, to be transmuted!
   Someone said, "What is Basil?" and then he dreamed that he saw a pillar
   of light and heard a voice saying, "This is Basil."

   Oh that we might be, in character, like burning and shining lights, and
   may our light and fire be love to God and love to men! Surely He that
   has made us precious in His sight and made us honorable, and loved us
   so, deserves that, for His sake, we should go out and seek His lost
   precious ones and bring in the dishonorable, that they may be
   honorable! If it is written "I have loved you," let us feel the force
   of heavenly love and serve the Lord with gladness!

   Now, poor souls, you that have had no share in all this text--you may
   have a share in it! Is there anyone here who is empty? Christ has come
   on purpose to fill him! Is there a soul here that is hungry after God
   and salvation? Then it is written, "He has filled the hungry with good
   things, but the rich He has sent empty away." Sinners are scarce
   articles. "Why," you say, "they are common as blackberries." Yes, those
   that will say they are sinners, but those who truly feel that they are
   sinners are very scarce! A sinner is a sacred thing--the Holy Spirit
   has made him so. He that really knows his sinnership is redeemed by
   Christ! He is the man that Christ came to save! He is the man to whom
   infinite blessings belong! He is the man who may lift up his heart unto
   God and rest in Jesus. You blind eyes, Christ came to open you! You
   prisoners, Christ came to set you free! You good-for-nothings, you
   ungodly ones, you sinful, you that have no good thing in yourselves,
   but are despairing at the gates of Hell--"unto you is the Word of this
   salvation sent." Christ has come to save such as you are!

   For proud Pharisees, Christ has nothing! He came "not to call the
   righteous, but sinners to repentance." He came not to fill the
   full--they want it not. Nor did He come to heal the healthy--they need
   it not. But He comes to save you that have no good thing about
   you--that have no good feelings within you. You that have no broken
   hearts, He comes to give you broken hearts. You that have no faith, He
   comes to give you faith. You that have no repentance, He comes to give
   you repentance--

   "True belief and true repentance, Every Grace that brings you nigh!
   Without money,

   Come to Jesus Christ and buy."

   And oh, what a surprise it will be for you to hear His Spirit saying to
   you, by-and-by, "Because I loved you before the world was--because I
   had chosen you--because I had determined to save you, because you were
   precious in My sight, therefore you are honorable, and I have loved
   you. Come and rejoice in Me." God help you to do so, for Jesus' sake,
   Amen.

                             The Voice Behind Thee

   A Sermon

   (No. 1672)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, July 23rd, 1882, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way,
   walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the
   left.'Isaiah 30:21.

   ON the Sabbath before last we spoke concerning the still small voice.'
   After the thunder and the fire and the earthquake had passed away, for
   the Lord was not in them, there came a still small voice unto Elijah,
   which reached the prophet's heart, and brought him back to his former
   condition of communion with God. This hopeful morning we shall hear
   that same still small voice' actually speaking a warning and teaching
   word, and we shall see how it operates upon the sinner, reaching both
   his ear and his heart. God calls to the rebellious, and by his gentle
   word they are brought to his feet with repentance, turned from their
   evil wandering, and led in the way of obedience.

   The word behind us which is spoken of in the text is mentioned as one
   among other covenant blessings. No if' or but' is joined to it. It is
   one of those gracious, unconditional promises upon which the salvation
   of the guilty depends. There are many comforts of the new life which
   depend upon our own action and behaviour, and these come to us with
   ifs'; but those which are vital and essential are secured to the chosen
   of God without but' or peradventure.' It shall be so: God declares it
   shall, and he has power to carry out every jot and tittle of every
   promise that he makes to his people. I shall ask you at this good hour
   mainly to admire the free and sovereign grace of God in making such a
   promise as this to anybody, and especially in making it to a people
   whom he speaks of as a rebellious people, lying children, children that
   will not hear the law of the Lord.' He severely upbraids them, and then
   in great patience he says to them, even to them, Your ears shall hear a
   word behind you.' God's grace is marvellous in itself, but its most
   marvellous point is the singular channel in which it chooses to flow:
   it runs down into the Dead Sea of sin and makes the waters pure.

   I. I invite you to notice first of all THE POSITION OF THE WANDERER to
   whom this special blessing comes. How does God find men when he
   declares that they shall hear a word behind them? First, he finds them
   with their backs turned to him. This is clear enough, if you remember
   that the word is to be heard behind' them. The sinner has gone away
   from God, and God calls after him from behind. He has turned his back
   upon his true Friend, his best Friend, his only capable Friend, but
   that Friend does not therefore change his temper and resent the insult;
   nay, he is provoked to a love more pleading and persuasive than ever,
   and calls to him to come into the right way. After having transgressed
   wilfully and wickedly, the rebel now distinctly turns his back on God
   and truth; according to the Lord's complaint, they have turned unto me
   the back, and not the face.' He turns his back on the law, on the
   gospel, on mercy, on eternal life. He turns his back on the adoption of
   the great Father, on pardon bought with the blood of Jesus, on
   regeneration which can alone be wrought by the Holy Spirit: he turns
   his back upon holiness, happiness, and heaven. He turns away from
   sunlight, and wanders down into deeper and yet deeper night, striving
   to get away from God and holy influences. Yet the Lord follows him, and
   with a voice of touching love and tender compassion he calls to him,
   This is the way, walk ye in it.' The word of warning, instruction, and
   entreaty follows the wanderer, and with ever-increasing pathos
   beseeches him to turn and live. Again and again the wise, earnest,
   personal voice assails his ear, as if love resolved that he should not
   perish if wooing could win him to life. The wanderer seeks not God, but
   his God seeks him. Man turns from the God of love, but the love of God
   turns not away from him.

   What matchless grace is this, that God should thus call after sinners
   when they openly renounce his rule, and flee from his mercy. Oh, if the
   Lord had turned his back on us, where had we been? If he had given us
   up to our own devices, and left us to ourselves, then our eternal ruin
   would want but a few more days and months to consummate itself, and we
   should be driven for ever from the presence of the Lord and from the
   glory of his power. Have we not said unto God, Depart from us: we
   desire not the knowledge of thy ways'? If he had replied to us, Depart,
   ye cursed, into everlasting fire in hell,' it had only been the echo of
   our own words. When we said to him Depart,' suppose he had turned round
   and said, Depart, depart yourselves.' But instead of that, while we
   turn ourselves deliberately away from God, he still calls after us; he
   will not let us go. We have a freedom of will, but it is by that
   freedom of will that men are damned, since they will not come unto
   Christ that they might have life, but they will to follow the devices
   and desires of their own hearts. Free-will, thus held in chains by evil
   lustings, becomes the most destructive agency in the world; but,
   blessed be God, he has freedom of will too, and that freedom of
   sovereign grace will not have its hands bound nor its lips closed, but
   it will act and speak in omnipotent love. So when the Lord sees us in
   the wantonness of our wickedness, dead in trespasses and sins, his
   great love wherewith he loves us seeks us out, and from the lips of
   that love come tender accents bidding us return to God, saying, This is
   the way, walk ye in it.'

   Observe that these persons had not only turned their backs on God, but
   they were going further and further away from him. Of course, when you
   have once turned your back upon the right, the further you travel the
   more wrong you become. They were not content to be near to God, even
   with their backs to him, but they hastened away. They are eager and
   quick to escape from their own mercy. Like the prodigal, they are not
   satisfied till they get into a far country': they cannot rest in the
   same land with their God: they journey with all speed away from the
   Lord, and the greater the distance that they can set between themselves
   and their Father the more are they at ease. In forgetting God they find
   a horrible peace: the peace of death, a peace which will stupefy them
   into eternal destruction. Now, it is while they are thus going hot foot
   away from God, further and further every day, madly rushing along the
   downward road, never satisfied with the sin to which they have
   attained, flying from God as if he were their terror and would be their
   destroyer, it is even then that the word sounds behind them and they
   are startled into thought. They have a powerful voice pleading with
   them thus,'Turn ye, turn ye; why will ye die, O house of Israel? This
   is the way, walk ye in it. The way you are now pursuing is not the way
   to peace and safety; return at once, for this is the way, walk ye in
   it.' Here again I admire the overflowing riches of the grace of God,
   that he should call men to himself when they are altogether taken up
   with other things, when every thought, and every word, and every act is
   in rebellion against him. Paul saith, Doth God care for oxen?' but here
   is a far greater wonder, Doth God care for worthless revolters?' When a
   chosen man is desperately set on mischief, determined to destroy
   himself, God is yet more determined to save him. The two determinations
   meet, and we shall see which of the two will prove itself the stronger
   one. We soon find that the determination of God overcomes the
   determination of man. The iron breaks the northern iron and the steel.
   Thus saith the Lord; your covenant with death is broken, and your
   league with hell is disannulled:' for there was a prior covenant, a
   covenant of grace made by God himself, which stands fast for ever; and
   there was a prior league which God made with his Son on our behalf, and
   that league shall overthrow our league with death and hell. Glory be to
   God that even when the sinner is still rebellious, and shows no signs
   of repentance, nor is conscious of any wish to turn from the error of
   his ways, even then, while his heart is black as night, and his spirit
   is choke-full with rebellion, God calls to him, Return, O backsliding
   children.' They shall hear a voice behind them, saying, This is the
   way.'

   More than this, however, is true. They had turned their backs on God,
   and were going further from him, though they were warned not to do so,
   and they were pursuing their course in spite of warning. Read the
   twentieth verse: Thine eyes shall see thy teachers': there they stood,
   good men, right in the way, entreating their hearers to cease from
   provoking their God and destroying their own souls. Hear them cry, Turn
   ye from your iniquities, for this way leads to death: turn ye, turn
   ye.' They can see their teachers stretching out their hands with eager
   importunity, pleading even unto boiling tears, persuading them to turn
   from the way and the wages of sin. Still they push on, as if eternal
   destruction were a prize to be sought rather than a doom to be dreaded.
   Was it not so with many of us in the days of our unregeneracy? Mother
   and father endeavored to block up the evil road: in them our eyes
   beheld our teachers. How they taught us: how they prayed with us: how
   they laboured if possible to turn us from the error of our ways! But we
   persevered with obstinate resolve. It is hard going to hell over a
   pleading mother, and equally hard to destroy one's self by pushing
   aside an earnest father's good advice; but we seemed resolved to do so.
   Then perhaps followed Sunday-school teachers, full of intense love to
   us; and how they pleaded! How wisely they set the case before us, and
   how tenderly they pleaded: our eyes did see our teachers, but still our
   eyes would not see the right way, nor would our hearts desire it; we
   were determined that we would by hook or by crook land ourselves in
   hell. Our soul was given to her idols, and after those idols we
   resolved to go. We loved the wages of iniquity, the pleasures of the
   flesh, the pride of life, the conceit of self-salvation: we loved
   anything better than our God; and though our teachers were before us,
   ready to help and eager to teach we made small account of them. In
   after-life it may be our teachers were earnest pastors, who could not
   preach dull, dead sermons, and would not suffer us to sleep ourselves
   into perdition. They cried aloud and spared not: they were in anguish
   about us: they gave themselves no rest until we would turn from our
   iniquities. We could see our teachers, and we had a loving respect for
   them too, yet we cast their word behind our back: it was of no use to
   us: we loved iniquity, and that way we would go, come what might of it.
   Yet even then, when we were despising God's prophets and paying no
   regard to all the words of warning, the Lord was still loving us,
   looking after us, and crying after us, and saying, This is the way;
   this is the way: walk ye in it. Come back, come back, come back: you
   are destroying yourselves: return unto your Father and your God.' Why
   did he not throw the reins on our necks, and say, Let them alone; they
   are given unto idols: I have hewed them with the prophets, I have
   ploughed them with men of God, but all has come to nought; they have
   stiffened their necks, they have hardened their hearts, they have made
   their forehead like unto an adamant stone; therefore let them reap the
   result of their transgressions'? But it was not so, for God had made
   this word an unconditional promise of his covenant, They shall hear a
   voice behind them.'

   One more mark of the ungodly condition of those whom God would call was
   this, that they had many ways in which to wander. Sometimes they roamed
   to the right hand, at other times they wandered to the left, but they
   never turned face about. Hear ye the way to heaven; it is right about
   face then keep straight on to glory. Nay, but we will turn this way, we
   will turn that way, we will turn any way except to God. Some men have
   right-hand sins, respectable iniquities which challenge little censure
   from their fellows; not black, but whitewashed sins. Such men are not
   thieves, they are not licentious, they are not drunkards, but their
   sins take a quieter form; they mock God with their self-righteousness,
   and insult him with their prayers, which are no prayers, but only
   pretences and fictions, and not the real prayers of God's elect ones.
   Others have left-hand sins; they plunge into the sins of the flesh; no
   vice is too black for them. Only propose to have a little pleasure and
   they will plunge into any vice to gain it: ay, and almost without
   pleasure, altogether without present profit, they will sin, as if for
   sin's own sake. When they have burned their finger in the candle they
   will after that hold their arm in the fire; when they have brought
   disease into their bodies by sin they will return to the evil which
   caused it; when they have beggared their purse by their extravagant
   lusts yet still they will go on playing the profligate; when they have
   filled themselves with despair till they are as a bucket running with
   gall and wormwood, and this has been emptied out for them by God's
   grace, they will fill it up again, for they are infatuated with sin;
   they find a delight in it and they will not, they cannot give it up.
   Shall the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may
   they that have been accustomed to do evil learn to do well. Alas, such
   a miracle has not happened to them. They choose all shapes of evil, but
   the good they will not have. I say their right-hand sins, their
   left-hand sins, sins of their life, sins of their heart,'they will
   follow all these eagerly, but unless God by his own omnipotent voice
   shall call them back they will not come to him, to Jesus, to grace, to
   holiness, and heaven. Tell it, tell it, tell it; sound it forth beneath
   the sky for ever and ever, that the Lord does call to himself such
   wanton wanderers. Go and proclaim these words toward the north, saith
   the Lord: Turn, O backsliding children; for I am married unto you.' Oh,
   the pity of God, not only for the miserable, but for the wicked; it
   surpasses thought. In due time Christ died for the ungodly.' Favour to
   the guilty is the choicest of favour. We come not to preach salvation
   to the righteous'for where shall we find them?'but we proclaim it to
   the unrighteous and to the ungodly. The whole have no need of a
   physician; but they that are sick'; and Christ has come after the sick,
   calling, not the righteous, but sinners to repentance. Oh, if anything
   will touch the heart it should be this word of free grace, this fact
   that God doth bid men return to him. Mercy is full of patience; it
   bears and forbears, and still it cries, This is the way, walk ye in
   it'; oh, who would be so cruelly ungrateful as to close his ear against
   its pleadings?

   Thus I have spoken sufficiently upon the position of the wanderer.

   II. Now, for a little while, we will dwell upon THE CALL OF MERCY.
   Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee.'

   Notice, it is a call that is altogether undesired, and comes unsought
   to the man who has gone astray. He hears the inward call whose voice is
   Return:' he looks for a moment, and then puts his foot down to pursue
   his journey. Never,' he says, will I alter my course,' and he boldly
   hastens on, though before him lie death and hell. As he is persevering
   in his ruinous course the same word again bids him Return.' He hears
   the admonition, but still he pushes on; he must not and will not return
   from the way of evil. If he could reach a spot where such disturbing
   voices would never trouble him how gladly would he hasten towards it.
   Hence so many altogether forsake the place of worship: they prefer the
   stagnant pool of stupid obstinacy to the sweet river of the water of
   life. So far from desiring to be warned, if they could voyage to a
   distant Tarshish, where voices of warning would never reach them more,
   it would be a delightful journey; and if ship could be taken, they
   would, like Jonah, pay the fare to the shipmaster, and secure a berth
   in the next vessel. I have heard of one in the backwoods of America who
   was unloading his furniture, and while doing so up rode a Methodist
   minister. Confound you,' said he, I have moved half-a-dozen times to
   get away from you Methodist fellows: I am never comfortable where you
   are. I will put the things on the cart again, and find a spot where I
   shall be free from you.' On they went to another clearing, but when
   they reached it the first thing that happened, before the man took up
   his lodging, was the appearance of a Methodist minister. Where shall I
   go to get away from you Methodist preachers?' There is nowhere I know
   of,' said the minister, that you can go, for I am afraid if you go to
   hell you will find some of them there, for preachers have been lost.
   The very best thing you can do is to yield at once, and let me hold a
   service to-night in your camp.' That was sound advice; and so some of
   you will be pestered and worried as long as you live if you will not
   come to Christ. Omnipotence has servants everywhere, and these are all
   charged to warn you of your peril. I knew one who would not go to a
   place of worship, and turned every Bible out of his house; but he found
   a copy of the holy Book in his house, and as he cursed and swore he
   learned that it was the property of a daughter whom he loved too much
   to scold, and he was obliged to let the sacred volume rest where she
   had placed it. A Bible in a house where it is forbidden to be read is a
   splendid power for good, as he soon discovered. In a house where it is
   outwardly honoured the Bible may have little influence, but if it gets
   where it must not be allowed, everybody reads it. If you can make God's
   Word to be forbidden fruit, Eve will feed on it, and Adam will follow
   her. Thus the grace of God came into the house, and it would never be
   expelled. Down by Mitcham, when the lavender is growing, if you take a
   house there you will discern a smell of lavender; you may shut the
   windows and close the doors, but when any persons enter a whiff of
   lavender enters with them, you cannot help it; and if you live where
   the gospel is preached at all you will be sure to hear it, and made to
   know of it. It is God's intention that you should. It is a voice that
   comes unasked and undesired, but come it does.

   A word behind thee'; it is the voice of an unseen caller whose
   existence has been almost forgotten. It is not the teachers that speak
   in this powerful way. The teachers you have seen with your eyes, and
   they have done you no good; but someone calls whom you never saw and
   never will see till he sits on the throne of judgment at the last great
   day; but still he utters a word which cannot be kept out of your ears.
   It will come to you mysteriously at all sorts of hours crying, Return,
   return, return.' It will sound often at dead of night, and make the
   chambers of conscience ring with its notes. I have known it to wake a
   man out of his slumbers: I have known it sound in his dreams till he
   dreamed of hell, and woke up and felt the torment in his own
   conscience. Though he has done all he could, has been off to the
   theatre, to the gay party, to the entertainment, to deeper sin, yet
   still even there the word has haunted him. I recollect one who in this
   very city plunged into all manner of gaiety to try to get rid of this
   word, yet God met him in a play; words were used in the performance
   which touched his conscience, and he fled from the playhouse as from a
   burning building, fell on his knees, and sought and found the Saviour.
   This call of mercy is the word of a hidden One: you cannot see who it
   is that speaks, yet you cannot shut your ears to his admonitions nor
   refuse reverence to his warnings.

   This voice pursues and overtakes the sinner. Do you see him
   running,'with all his might rushing to his own destruction? The word
   comes, at first, rather feebly'Return.' He scarcely looks back, but on
   he flies. Lo, the voice follows. He runs faster from it to show his
   determination to carry out his own will. The voice still follows him,
   saying, Return.' Then he stops a minute, but being desperately
   enamoured of his transgressions, he again takes to his heels to fly
   away from God; still the word pursues his footsteps, and in pleading
   accents cries,'Return, return, return, return;' till at last he is
   constrained to sit down and listen to the word which comes from he
   knows not where. He cannot understand how and why it comes so home to
   him, but it is a fulfillment of the promise; it is the word behind him
   saying, This is the way, walk ye in it.'

   That voice when it comes to sinners is generally most opportune, for
   according to the text they are to hear this voice behind them when they
   turn to the right hand or to the left. A man may go steadily plodding
   on in his course of ungodliness and hear no such word of pleading, but
   how often it has happened that there has been a temptation of a more
   than usually forceful character, and the traveller was about to turn to
   the right, and then, at that precise moment, he has heard the word of
   God behind him giving him warning. His feet had almost gone; his steps
   had well-nigh slipped, but the word of the Lord upheld him, and he went
   not into the deadly sin. Or it may be it is what I have described as a
   left-handed sin: the man was carried on to an action which, if he had
   actually performed it, would have involved his sure destruction; but
   just as he was about to turn down Deadman's Lane there came a voice
   behind him, Return, return.' Often it is so, and even if the man does
   not return and seek the right way, but keeps steadily on as carelessly
   as ever, still he is slackening his speed, and he dares not take that
   left-hand turning into gross sin which he would have followed if the
   word had not checked him. Even where the Spirit of God does not save a
   man it keeps him from many a sin; and when men rebel against the light
   and will not yield to it, yet still that light has a restraining
   influence over them of which they may be unconscious. Those who watch
   them know that if that bit and bridle had not been supplied by the word
   they would have gone to an excess of riot which would have been
   dangerous to others as well as totally destructive to themselves.
   Blessed be God for the opportuneness of the word of mercy. Men delay to
   come, but God does not delay to call.

   And you see, to close this second point, that it is absolutely
   necessary that the potent word should be spoken and should be heard.
   For the man had seen his teachers, but they had not wrought him any
   good. How often the Lord seems to put us ministers right up in the
   corner with our faces to the wall, till we are little in the eyes of
   our hearers and little in our own eyes. He does so with me, and while I
   can glorify his name and bless him abundantly for the many that are
   brought to Christ, yet I never take the slightest congratulation to
   myself about it, for what am I but the driest and most barren stick
   that there is in all my Master's garden apart from his watering? If
   sinners had nothing to save them but us poor preachers, not one of them
   would be brought up from death and hell. Sinners would laugh at us as
   simpletons if God were not with us: they do so as it is, and I do not
   wonder at it, because there is enough in us that deserves to be laughed
   at. They are ready to despise us, and we cannot be broken-hearted if
   they do, for we ourselves used in former days to despise the servants
   of God, and if we do not do so now, it is because the grace of God has
   made a change in us: we cannot expect better treatment than we
   ourselves rendered to better men when they pleaded with us. The word
   behind us is needful, that still small voice' which no mortal man can
   speak, but only God himself, that inward monition of the conscience,
   that touching language of the heart which is as much beyond the power
   of man as to make a world or breath life into an image of clay.
   Therefore pray ye mightily to the blessed Spirit that he may breathe on
   men and save them, and that the word of God may still follow and pursue
   them till they turn from the way of transgression.

   I leave that point. You have seen the position of the rambler, and the
   grace of God in the call of mercy.

   III. But what was THE WORD OF THAT CALL? It is stated at full length,
   This is the way, walk ye in it.' That is the word of the call. It
   contains within itself, first, specific instruction. This is the way.'
   There is a kind of preaching which has nothing specific, definite, and
   positive in it: it is a bit of cloud-land, and you may make what you
   like out of it'God's grace or man's merit, faith in Christ or faith in
   self. You need to be your own instructor, and then like the child
   looking into the fire you will see whatever your own eye chooses to
   create. Too much preaching is of a kind so mixed that it reminds me of
   the showman when his visitors asked, Which is Wellington and which is
   Napoleon?' Whichever you please,' said he; you have paid your money and
   you may take your choice.' So it seems to be with many preachers as to
   doctrine. You may have what kind of doctrine you like so long as you
   pay your pew-rent. Cleverly put,' cries one, when he had heard a smart
   sermon. Is not that enough? I answer, it is not enough: we want the
   sure testimony of revelation, sealed in the heart by the Holy Ghost.
   Cleverness is not God's way of blessing men. Conjectures and loose
   opinions are not worth the breath which is expended in expressing them.
   The Lord lays down a definite pathway, and he says, This is the way.'
   Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved; this is the
   way. Repent and be converted, every one of you; this is the way. To
   leave sin, to quit self, to trust in Christ: this is the way.'
   Something definite is laid down before those who desire to be taught of
   God, and they are told what is to be done, what is to be received, what
   is to be given up. This is the way.' Definite instruction is given.
   This may not suit the Broad School, but it is exactly what the anxious
   seeker needs.

   This definite instruction may also be said to be a special correction.
   When the voice behind says, This is the way,' it does as good as say
   that the opposite path is not the way; for there is only one way to
   heaven, and there never will be two; and when men hear a voice saying,
   This is the way,' it does in effect remind them that the opposite is
   not the way. If ye are going the reverse of the right way, turn ye from
   it, and ye shall live. How much we ought to bless God that the gospel
   comes in as a corrective, kills the false and introduces us to the
   true. May falsehood be slain within us, and truth reign there for ever.
   May we leave all other roads, since the Lord has said of one road only,
   This is the way.'

   It is also a word of sure confirmation. This is the way.' When that is
   heard many times,'This is the way,' This is the way,' This is the way;'
   when, according to our hymn,

   We hear our Saviour say,

   Come hither, soul, I am the Way,'

   if we have already believed it to be the way we are strengthened in
   that conviction. Hearing the mysterious word declaring again and again,
   This is the way,' men grow to believe the truth of God's word, and out
   of that by-and-by there is begotten a living faith in a living Saviour.
   Oh, this is a great mercy, to hear the same thing many times, to hear
   the voice proclaim again and again and again, This is the way,' This is
   the way.' Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid,
   Jesus Christ, the righteous.' May the repetitions of the Spirit
   effectually preserve us from the deadly shadow of doubt, and fix us as
   a nail in a sure place.

   This is followed up by a word of personal direction. Walk ye in it.' Do
   not merely hear about it, but walk ye in it.' Be not content to be
   critics, thinkers, and considerers, but become doers of the word. This
   is the way,'here is the doctrine: Walk ye in it,'there is the practice.
   Well is it when the Lord by his Spirit speaks to the runaway sinner and
   tells him what he is to do and to believe; then he makes the way and
   the walk to be vividly present,'This is the way, walk ye in it' without
   delay.

   This takes the form of encouraging permission. Some think they may not
   come to Christ. They actually ask the question, May I believe in him?
   Is there salvation for me?' Why, saith the text, This is the way.' Do
   not sit looking at it: walk ye in it.' But I am so big a sinner.'
   Christ is the way; walk ye in it.' There is room enough for big sinners
   in Jesus. But I have been so long coming.' Never mind: this is the way,
   walk ye in it.' Never mind if you have been seventy years coming if you
   have come to the way at last, Walk ye in it.' But I am afraid my feet
   are so polluted that I shall stain the way:' This is the way, walk ye
   in it.' You are not told to stand on one side and wait till something
   shall happen to you which shall persuade you to come, but here is the
   king's highway, walk ye in it. Walking is the simplest of all
   exercises. There is no great artistic skill required in order to walk,
   but walking is all that is wanted. Come to Christ,'come to him anyhow.
   Oh soul, tumble to him somehow; trust him as best you can: and if you
   cannot do it without question, trust him because you must trust him,
   since you have nobody else to trust to. Throw yourself into Jesus'
   arms; swoon away on the bosom of Christ. It is the essence of faith, to
   die into the life of God in Christ Jesus. This is the message which
   comes behind many a runaway sinner,'This is the way, walk ye in it.'

   IV. According to our text success is promised to the word. Thine ears
   shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it.'
   Notice, THE SUCCESS OF THE WORD,'thine ears shall hear. God not only
   gives us something to hear, but he gives us ears to hear with. Oh, the
   mercy of God! he spreads the table, and then he gives the appetite; he
   furnishes the garments, and he gives us the sense of nakedness, and so
   leads us to put them on. Everything that is wanted to bear a man from
   the gates of hell to the gates of heaven free-grace provides. Nothing
   is left out: the catalogue is complete: he that sends the tidings also
   opens the ears. Thine ears shall hear.' This is effectual grace.
   Teachers cannot make men hear. They can appeal to the external ear, and
   after that they have no more that they can do; but God can make men
   hear. Without violating the freedom of their wills he can get at their
   hearts, at their consciences, at their understandings, and he can press
   the truth home to their souls. When the Lord does it, it is done. When
   we do it, it is often so done that afterwards it is undone, but verily
   I know that what God doeth shall be for ever. All that is of nature's
   spinning will be unravelled one day; but when God spins, it will last
   throughout eternity.

   I take it when we read here, Thine ears shall hear,' it means first,
   that the message of divine love shall come to the man's mind so as to
   create uneasiness in it. He is jauntily traversing the road to
   destruction: he has chosen the path, and he delights in it. It often
   looks to him to be a flowery way, a pleasant road. So he walks on, and
   he would be very happy but for that word behind him crying, Turn ye!
   turn ye! turn ye!' Just as he was turning down that glade in the wood
   to the right, where all the flowers of spring are found in profusion,
   that call troubled him again! He would sooner have seen a serpent
   hissing in the pathway, or heard a lion roar from the thicket, than
   have heard that word. The man says, I never can be quiet: I can see
   other people going to amusements and pleasures, and they heartily enjoy
   themselves; but the fact is, the more amusement I have the less I am
   amused, and I am never more miserable than when everybody else is
   laughing. Why am I thus?' He thinks he is hardly done by, and is the
   special object of God's hatred. Everybody else is jolly, but he is
   gloomy. They can look on the wine when it is red, when it moveth itself
   aright, when it giveth its colour in the cup; and so could he once look
   into the rosy depths, but now he sees that serpent at the bottom of it,
   and he is afraid to touch it lest the draught should turn to venom in
   his veins. He almost curses the arrangements of heaven which have made
   him so ill at ease. He wishes he had never heard the parson preach the
   sermon which bothered him so; he wishes he had never had a godly mother
   at all, that he might have gone straight away into sin, and have been
   as merry as a cricket; but now there is that voice again behind him,
   boring its way into his tingling ears. For a moment he had forgotten
   it, but there it comes again'Turn! turn! turn! turn!' He stops his
   ears; but it bombards his soul with worse than cannon balls; as if the
   word of God pounded him with shells, he hears the thunders of the
   cannonade,'Return! Return! Return!' What can he do? He longs to escape
   from the divine rebuke. The word has made him quiver and quake. So far
   so good. We shall see next what will happen to him.

   After a while there gets to be a desire in his heart. It is only a
   faint and spasmodic desire,'nothing very strong or constant'but there
   it is, and it cannot be quenched. I wish I could get right somehow: for
   in my present condition I am in an evil case; I am sailing in the wrong
   boat; I wish I could land somewhere, and take the return boat and get
   to my home. I do not feel at all easy; I wish I knew what to do to be
   saved. I do know it somehow, for I have heard it every Sabbath day, but
   yet I do not understand it; I cannot get hold of it; I wish I could,
   for I am anxious to be forgiven, to be renewed in the spirit of my
   mind, to be made a new creature in Christ Jesus.' Do you know,' he says
   to someone, that voice I could not bear, that used to wake me up at
   nights, that kept me out of pleasure? There is a kind of music in it
   now; I like to hear it: I wish I heard it so that it had an effect upon
   me, for I am afraid I shall go down to the pit, and be lost under
   accumulated responsibilities for having neglected the call of divine
   love. Oh, help me to come to Christ, for I am anxious to reach him, but
   I feel as if I could not come. I do not feel as I ought. I am told to
   believe, but I do not know what it means, or I cannot do it.

   I would but can't believe,

   Then all would easy be.

   I would but cannot, Lord, relieve:

   My help must come from thee.'

   He is getting on all right, friends. We shall have a better bulletin
   concerning him directly. He is wonderfully improving: a great deal of
   the fever of pride has gone out of the man; we shall have him yet in
   perfect health. He could not rest because he heard too much of the word
   behind him, and now he cannot rest because he cannot hear enough of it:
   he desires that it may penetrate his soul and change him from darkness
   to light.

   What shall happen next? As that voice continues to sound, it pulls him
   up, and leads to resolve. The word of the Lord has put a bit into his
   mouth and a bridle between his jaws; he does not dare go any further;
   he sits down to consider. I think I saw him on his knees too, and he is
   resolved if heaven is to be had he will have it; if mercy is to be
   found he will find it; he will rake the world over, but he will gain
   the pearl of great price. I think I heard him say he would not go to
   sleep till he found Jesus. I am glad he has come to that pass. Friend,
   you are just like the prodigal when he said, I will arise and go to my
   father'; only take care you do not end in resolutions. Let it be said
   of you as of that same prodigal, He arose, and came to his father'; for
   all our resolutions are not worth the making unless they be most
   earnestly and speedily carried into effect. Observe the effect of the
   word behind the wanderer. Cannot you see the man who was running so
   fast? He has pulled up. He sees a line drawn across his path, and he
   must not go over it. He feels that if he goes further he may never have
   another call of mercy, and this makes him pause. Did not we sing this
   morning,

   Soon that voice will cease its calling'?

   The man is anxious to obey while he may. He is not yet resolved to go
   back, but he dares not go further.

   Watch him, for the voice is calling again, and he is every now and then
   turning his ear round as if he wanted to hear it. Return, return,
   return.' He smites upon his breast and cries, Would God I could return;
   I will return, for I cannot perish; I cannot let things go as once I
   did; I cannot leave everything to take its own way while I take my
   chance. No, I must have Christ or else I die, and I must have him soon,
   or else I shall seal my eternal destiny, and prove a castaway for ever.
   O God, call again, call again; keep on calling, till I come; for lo, my
   spirit answers, Draw me, and I will run after thee.' When thou saidst
   unto me, Seek ye my face,' my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord,
   will I seek.'

   What will be the last stage of this inner work? Since the man dares not
   go any further in this wrong way, what is he to do? He cannot turn to
   the right or to the left, for God has hedged up his way with thorns.
   Now, listen to what he will say, I will return unto my first husband,
   for it was better with me then than now.' This poor soul looks on him
   whom he pierced. He did not know he was piercing his Redeemer; but now
   he sees it all, and while his eyes begin to stream with tears, he turns
   unto this Christ upon the cross, and finds life while looking at him.
   See him get up and feel as if he did not know what to do with himself
   as he cries,

   Blest cross; blest sepulchre; blest rather be

   The man that here did shed his blood for me.'

   Now he enquires, Which is my way? Speak, sweet voice; speak, sweet
   voice; tell me which is my way.' And now the voice moves and speaks in
   front of him; for shepherds go before their sheep. The man looks and
   sees the Crucified One with pierced hands and feet leading the way, and
   he delights to follow him: ay, and he shall follow him until at the
   last he shall see his face in glory everlasting. Redeemed by blood and
   rescued by power eternal, and brought home to the great Shepherd's
   fold, to go no more out for ever, the sinner shall be filled with
   gladness. Listen, then, listen, ye that have turned your backs on God!
   Infinite mercy woos you, boundless compassion entreats you to be saved.
   Turn ye; turn as you are, all black and filthy and bemired; tarry not
   to mend or wash, but come to Jesus all unholy and unclean, without a
   single sound speck upon your leprous frame, utterly lost and ruined.
   Christ died for such as you. I say again, tarry not to improve
   yourselves, but come now, while mercy's voice incites you, while the
   Holy Ghost not only entreats, but sweetly constrains. Come and welcome,
   sinners, come. The Lord bless you. Amen.

Who Is This?

   (No. 1673)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 6, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For who is this that engaged His heart to approach unto Me? says the
   Lord." Jeremiah 30:21.

   I MENTIONED in the reading that there is a very remarkable change of
   tone in the Book of Jeremiah, at the 30th chapter. You read on through
   the 29 chapters and you hear nothing but "a weeping and wailing," while
   the Prophet stands before you, girt with sackcloth, bidding Israel,
   "lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned back
   from us." When you come to the middle of the 30th chapter, all is
   changed--you have left the dungeon for the pleasant meads and you hear
   "thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry." Here flowers of
   promise glorify the fields and birds of praise sweeten the air with
   music. The people are first made to tremble and fear on account of sin
   and all faces are turned into paleness--and then the Lord declares His
   immeasurable Grace, saying, "I am with you to save you: though I make a
   full end of all nations where I have scattered you, yet will I not make
   a full end of you."

   The condition of the sinful people is brought home to them and the
   nation is solemnly told--"Your bruise is incurable and your wound is
   grievous. There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up:
   you have no healing medicines. Why do you cry for your affliction? Your
   sorrow is incurable, for the multitude of your iniquity--because your
   sins were increased, I have done these things unto you." And then man's
   extremity of misery becomes God's opportunity of mercy! When and where
   sin abounds, Grace does much more abound, and the Lord displays His
   wonders of love. He graciously declares--"I will restore health unto
   you, and I will heal you of your wounds."

   The reason for the change is not difficult to find. The Prophet is led
   to speak of Covenant promises, such as that in the 22nd verse, "You
   shall be My people, and I will be your God." No wonder that Jeremiah's
   strain grew more cheerful and jubilant! Was there ever such a box of
   perfume as the Covenant? Was there ever such a harp of golden strings,
   all tuned to the music of consolation, as the Covenant? Inspired by
   this subject, he exclaims in the next chapter--"For thus says the Lord;
   Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations:
   publish you, praise you, and say, O Lord, save Your people, the remnant
   of Israel."

   Moreover, he introduces to us that glorious Messenger of the Covenant
   whom we delight in. He speaks of the Messiah, who is the Glorious One,
   who has engaged His heart to approach unto God and, as when the sun
   rises, darkness flees, so when the Savior appears, his sorrows vanish
   and Jeremiah becomes as eloquent with joy as Isaiah himself! Think no
   more of Jeremiah as exclusively the weeping Prophet, for the flashes of
   his delight make the night of his sorrow brilliant with an aurora of
   heavenly brilliance! The answer to the question of our text is the
   reason why Jeremiah put away his dust and ashes and girt himself with
   beauteous array.

   God had, for a while, on account of their great sin, put away His
   people and wounded them with the chastisement of a cruel one for the
   multitude of their iniquities. They could not walk with Him, for they
   were not agreed with Him. He could not accept their sacrifices, for
   they were polluted. He could not listen to their prayers, for they were
   hypocritical. He could not dwell with them, for they were proud-hearted
   and rebellious. So Zion came to be called an outcast whom no man seeks
   after. God, Himself, seemed to have given her a bill of divorce and to
   have put her away--but it only seemed that way.

   In Jehovah's heart of hearts He was still bound to His people whom He
   loved with an everlasting love. He could not cast away the seed of
   Abraham, His friend, and His heart yearned towards the people whom He
   had loved of old and borne with in great long-suffering. He had put
   them under a cloud because of their sin, yet He did earnestly remember
   them, still, for He bears witness, saying, "I am a father to Israel,
   and Ephraim is My first-born." The Lord loathed the distance which
   separated His people from Him and He longed to see them approach Him
   that He might comfort them

   and satiate their souls with His goodness. How was this to be done?
   This was the problem of that age, as it is the problem of all ages!

   How can guilty man return unto the Holy God? How can there be peace and
   amity, love and concord between the Judge of all the earth and His
   revolting and polluted creature, man? It was necessary that one should
   arise who would approach God on the behalf of the people, so that God
   might be well pleased with them for his righteousness' sake. But where
   was he to be found? Someone must come to God and, by his coming, make a
   way through which those whom he represented might have access. But
   where was this representative to be found? Paradise was lost--who was
   he by whom it could be regained? The question was asked and in man's
   ears it seemed to be asked in vain, for it is written, "There is none
   to plead your cause; all your lovers have forsaken you." "Who is this
   that engaged his heart to approach unto Me? says the Lord."

   One was needed to bridge the chasm which divided man from God. Who
   could do it? God, Himself, asked the question because He had, Himself,
   found the Person and would have us see Him and understand His glorious
   Character. My text comes from Jehovah's own lip--"Who is this that
   engaged His heart to approach unto Me? says the Lord." He sets the
   Mediator before us and asks, "Who is this?" We are sure that the Lord
   does not need to ask questions of us that He may gain information from
   us. "Known unto God are all His works," and much more must He be known
   by whom His most grand work is accomplished! Speaking in the name of
   Wisdom, our glorious Mediator says of the Lord, "I was by Him, as one
   brought up with Him: and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always
   before Him."

   So that the Lord only asks the question for our good, to set us
   thinking. This enquiry is fitly the sinner's question, when, trembling
   and convinced of sin and led to seek his God, he needs an Interposer,
   One of a thousand, who can put His hand upon the offender and the
   Offended and reconcile the rebel to his Lord. Therefore, in love the
   Lord takes up the sinner's question and answers it by Another. Behold a
   Daysman of Jehovah's own providing, who can lay His hands upon
   both--look at Him and answer, "Who is He?" The enquiry is made, I
   think, with three great designs--upon which I shall speak as I am
   enabled of the Spirit of God.

   First, to direct attention to this glorious Person--"Who is this?"
   Secondly, to excite admiration of His wondrous work "that engaged His
   heart to approach unto Me, says the Lord." And then, thirdly, to awaken
   our interest in the result of this marvelous approach unto God--for by
   it we are permitted and enabled to approach unto the Lord, ourselves,
   and we become His people and He confesses Himself to be our God. O for
   the Holy Spirit's own teaching, that I may speak aright to you upon
   this transcendent subject!

   I. The question of our text is asked TO DIRECT ATTENTION TO THIS
   GLORIOUS PERSON. "Who is this that engaged His heart to approach unto
   Me? says the Lord." We read the chapter and if you have read it
   attentively, or will do so, you will learn that the Person who must
   draw near to God must be one of ourselves. "Their nobles," or their
   Glorious One, "shall be of themselves, and their Governor shall proceed
   from the midst of them; and I will cause Him to draw near, and He shall
   approach unto Me." It is clear that a fit representative for men must
   be, himself, a man. It would not have been seemly that Adam, the
   representative of our race, should have been an angel--it was natural
   that he should be a man. In the same way, as man blocked up the road of
   communion with God, it was fitting that a man should make a new road
   and reestablish Divine communion.

   In Adam we transgressed and died to God--in another Adam must we be
   restored. If an angel were capable in all other respects of drawing
   near to God, yet it is clear that he could not do it on man's behalf,
   for an angel can only represent angels. Each order of beings must be
   represented by its own kind. Our Lord, as Man, took not up angels, for
   He was not made in their nature, but He took up the seed of Abraham
   because He had assumed their nature. It needed a man, perfect in his
   manhood, to head us up and stand as our federal head and
   representative, or otherwise we could not be restored by him.

   Now, then, Brothers and Sisters, where is this man to be found? "Who is
   this?" If he is to come of ourselves, where is he? Not among this
   assemblage--nor if all the myriads that dwell on the face of the earth
   could be gathered together would there be found one who could undertake
   this enterprise--"For all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of
   God." We have, none of us, that perfection which is required for such a
   work! How shall a sinner atone for sinners? He cannot make atonement
   for his own sin! He cannot render unto God for himself and on his own
   account the righteousness which Justice demands of him! How, then, can
   he have anything to spare for his fellow men? The best of men are, each

   one, in the condition of the wise virgins who, when the foolish virgins
   said, "Give us of your oil, for our lamps have gone out," replied, "Not
   so, lest there be not enough for us and you; but go you rather to them
   that sell and buy for yourselves."

   If the whole roll of history is searched, from Adam's fall to this
   moment, there is not one mere man to be found who could represent the
   race and make an approach for them to God on the ground of personal
   perfection! This is God's own verdict--"All have sinned, and come short
   of the Glory of God." The Lord looked from Heaven to see if there were
   any among the children of men that had not transgressed, but He found
   none, for, "they are all gone out of the way, they are together become
   unprofitable. There is none that does good, no, not one." Nor is it
   merit, alone, that is needed, for he that would approach unto the Lord
   as mediator must be prepared with strength to suffer. Who can sustain
   the load of human sin? Who can endure the indignation of the Lord
   against iniquity?

   Assuredly none of us could do it--the fire would consume us as stubble!
   O for an Interposer! But where can he be found? Who is this who can, as
   man, appear for men, and by his personal righteousness and sacrifice
   render man acceptable with God? There was a Man of matchless birth, at
   whose coming, angels sang, for they were told that He would bring Glory
   to God in the highest and on earth, peace. Find Him in Bethlehem's
   manger--there He lies, the son of Mary, truly Man, one of ourselves,
   partaker of our flesh and blood, subject to human needs, weaknesses,
   woes and able, therefore, to sympathize with us and have compassion
   upon us! That Man grew up in this world without taint or spot, free
   from sin whether natural or acquired, and yet He was, in the truest
   sense, one of ourselves, so that He is not ashamed to call us brethren!

   When the malicious eyes of Satan searched Him through and through, he
   found nothing of evil in Him. He was without spot or wrinkle, or any
   such thing, and He it is--glory be to His name--He it is that has
   engaged His heart to approach unto God on our behalf! He is the Son of
   Man, most truly, anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows,
   but still truly fellow with men! Though He counted it no robbery to be
   equal with God, yet He took upon Himself the form of a Servant and was
   made in the likeness of men that He might redeem us from our sin! Now
   look at the context and you will see that the Person who must approach
   God for us must be a Prince-Priest, for He is called "their Glorious
   One" and "their Governor," and yet it is said of Him, "I will cause Him
   to draw near," which work of drawing near is in other places ascribed
   to priests, for these God had set apart for the service of His
   sanctuary!

   The Hebrew word, "to draw near," signifies that peculiar action of a
   priest when he stands dealing with God on the behalf of men. The
   person, then, must be a priest and yet a prince. Who is he and where is
   he? It is not David, for if David would approach unto God in the office
   of a priest, he must not--he must resort to the priest who has the Urim
   and the Thummim--and the priest of the house of Aaron must inquire of
   God for David. This was one distinction between David and Saul, that
   David knew the limits of his office and never thought to over step it.
   David and Solomon never attempted to intrude into the holy office--they
   knew that they were not priests, but only kings--and when Uzzah stood
   to sacrifice like a priest, you know how the leprosy fell upon him. And
   they drove him out of the house of God which he was desecrating by
   intruding himself into the priestly office. He had to be shut up in a
   separate house all the rest of his life!

   Where shall we find one that even as a priest can really draw near to
   God for mankind? For remember, Brothers and Sisters, that the priests
   of old only drew near to God in figure and in metaphor--they could not
   actually and in very deed do so--for God is a consuming fire! Even when
   Moses went up unto the mount with God and did draw near in a certain
   sense, yet he never saw the face of God, for the Lord said, "You cannot
   see My face and live." The brightest vision that Moses ever had was
   that he saw the skirts of Jehovah's robe, or what Scripture styles, His
   back parts, for the face of God could not be seen. Mercy draws us near
   to God in Christ Jesus, but apart from the Mediator, an approach to
   absolute Deity means destruction!

   Neither among kings nor priests could the one man be found who could
   open the way to the Father! And certainly no king-priest could be
   found--the combination of the two offices falls not to the house of
   Aaron. A reverend personage had passed before the camera of history and
   left a shadowy trace of himself. But where now is he who was named
   Melchis-edec, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, to whom
   Abraham gave tithes of all? He was raised up for a special purpose and
   no one has inherited his peculiar call. That vision taught us what to
   look for, but it did not supply the Object of our search! It has
   prophesied the coming of the true Melchisedec, the Man without
   beginning of days or end of years, the Man without predecessor or
   successor, who is greater than Abraham and abides as both Priest and
   King for-

   ever, having once and for all drawn near to God on our behalf. You know
   Him--the true Priest of God, not of the order of Aaron--and the King
   eternal, immortal, invisible, King of kings, and Lord of lords! It is
   He that engaged His heart to draw near to God on our behalf!

   The question, however, may be answered in another way, so as to bring
   out more clearly the matchless Person whom our hearts adore at this
   moment. It was necessary that he who should draw near to God should be
   chosen to that office by God, Himself, and should be qualified for it
   by Divine power. "I will cause Him to draw near, and He shall approach
   to me." Now, is there anyone among us all that God has ever chosen to
   represent our fellow men as their mediator, acting as the head of the
   race and, as such, entering into the immediate Presence of God on his
   own merits? We have not, I hope, the presumption to imagine such a
   thing! "There is one Mediator between God and man, the Man, Christ
   Jesus." He it is that takes upon Himself our nature and our sin, and
   then goes in onto God and stands there, amidst the blaze of the
   ineffable Light, to represent manhood--and there is none else!

   On Him rested the Spirit of God without measure. The Dove descended on
   Him in the waters of His baptism and the Father said, "This is My
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." This was the great One elect
   of Heaven, ordained of the Father before the foundation of the
   world--and the Spirit of Glory and of might did rest upon Him--that He
   might be equipped for His mighty service and might engage His heart to
   approach unto God. This is He who said, "I looked, and there was none
   to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore My own
   arm brought salvation unto Me."

   Moreover, to close this description, He was not only appointed of God
   and qualified, but He was one who was willing to undertake the task and
   ready to pledge Himself to it. He voluntarily covenanted to do it, as
   it is written, "Lo, I come: in the volume of the Book it is written of
   Me, to do Your will, O God: yes, Your Law is My delight." He engaged
   His heart to this gracious office, resolving to carry out to a happy
   issue the work of reconciliation. Moved by inconceivable, immeasurable
   love and counting all the cost, He devoted Himself to the supreme
   effort. "Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it." Of His own
   free will He placed Himself before offended Justice to meet its claims
   and so He removed every barrier which stood between us and the Throne
   of God! He is that Breaker who has gone up before us, that King who is
   at the head of all His chosen ones.

   Now, where is such an One to be found unless it is the Lord Jesus? I
   trust many of us have given ourselves up to God and to His fear, drawn
   by almighty love. But it was never in our hearts to imagine that by
   giving up ourselves to holy service we could stand before God and open
   a way to Him for our fellow men! We are well aware of our incompetence
   for so grand a task. None of us have struck hands and covenanted with
   God to mediate, for we could not do it! I dread the thought of seeming
   to intrude into so Divine a work! We are priests unto God, but not
   mediators for men! When I hear of men pretending to hear the
   confessions of their fellow men and absolving them of their sins, I
   wonder that they sleep nights after professing so tremendous an act!

   I am amazed at what the power of Satan over them must be that they can
   rest after having assumed to act as vicars of Jehovah, He having given
   them no warrant and no authority for such a mediatorial position!
   Brothers and Sisters, this blasphemy of blasphemies may well become the
   Mother of Harlots, but the Bride of Christ abhors it! But oh, when my
   eyes rest upon Jesus, the only-begotten Son of God, in human flesh,
   then I cry, "This is He! Glory be to His name!" And, lost in wonder, my
   soul exclaims, "Who is this? Who is this? What manner of Man is this?
   Who is a God like unto You?" All this in wonder, but not in doubt, for
   the Lord Jesus can do this great work and He wills to do it! He has
   resolved and He will not fail nor be discouraged!

   Glory be to His name, He has done it! He has approached with engaged
   heart unto God on our behalf and, by His Sacrifice, He has made a way
   by which each one of us who is willing to do so may now approach unto
   God, even the Father, without fear. "Who is this?" Our soul is filled
   with amazement, but not with ignorance, for we answer this question in
   a word--He is God, Himself, Light of Lights, very God of very God,
   veiled in human flesh who has opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all
   Believers. "Who is this?" I answer, it is the Lawgiver, Himself, who
   has put Himself under the Law and who has borne the penalties of the
   Law that the Law may be glorified, while sin is pardoned and
   Law-breakers are justified! "Who is this?" It is infinite Holiness
   which has burdened itself with human sin, "For He has made Him to be
   sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of
   God in Him."

   Oh, if I had but words to speak with, I would try to extol Him who,
   being infinitely pure, nevertheless was numbered with the
   transgressors! Who, being incapable of spot, yet did bear upon Himself
   the enormous and horrible load of human guilt! In His own body on the
   tree, in flesh and soul, He suffered, the Just for the unjust, to bring
   us to God! Mark those words, for they show His end and objective--"to
   bring us to God." This is the way by which He brought us near, even by
   His own most precious blood! Yes, it is the heavenly One, who is
   blessed forevermore, who was made a curse for us! On whom, being
   everlastingly the object of Jehovah's love, there fell Jehovah's wrath
   on our account! Mystery of mystery! Miracle of miracles! This has
   astonished Heaven and earth and Hell!

   Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews and Son of the Highest, engaged His
   heart that He might wait upon the Judge of all the earth and answer for
   rebellious man with His own life--and so complete a way of access by
   which we may rise from our abyss of woes to the bosom of the Eternal!
   Though I have thus spoken to the best of my knowledge, I know that I
   cannot set out before you the full Glory of the Person of our Covenant
   Head. I shall go home saying to myself, "Who is this? Who is this?" and
   I shall have succeeded in my endeavor if you will, each one, say, "He
   could not tell us who He was. He could not reach the height of that
   great argument, but we shall, all through time and in eternity, go on
   wondering and saying, Who is this?"

   The more we wonder, the more shall we love and praise the Lord Jesus
   with our heart of hearts and say, "He has done all things well. We are
   made near by Him, never more to be separated from the love of God which
   is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Thus much upon the Person. How freely
   could I weep because I speak in words so poor and ill-chosen! I do but
   hold a candle to show the sun!

   II. I come now TO EXCITE ADMIRATION OF HIS MATCHLESS WORK. If Jesus
   Christ is to approach God for us, it is clear that He must come down
   into our condition, for He must, first, descend or He cannot ascend.
   Naturally there is such a Oneness between the blessed Persons of the
   Trinity that there can be no approaching, in their case, to one
   another, but Jesus, though He was forever in the highest sense, with
   God, left His place of Glory and took the position of our shame.
   "Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses." There He
   stands, even where we stood by nature! Where we lay in our blood, there
   He came and engaged His heart to deliver us!

   He stood at the Judgment bar because we had brought ourselves there. He
   was rejected of the people because we were rejected as reprobate
   silver. He was condemned because we were condemned and He was put to
   death because such was the sentence upon us! He descended into our
   depths to engineer a way from the lowest to the highest, to come back
   from Bashan, and from the depths of the sea, leading the van of the
   armies of His chosen as they return unto God with songs and everlasting
   joy upon their heads!

   This lowly place being taken, behold our Lord actually approaching unto
   the offended Majesty on high! Though found in fashion as a Man, by
   reason of His becoming a curse for us, He was denied the Presence of
   the Father, so that He cried in anguish, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?" Yet He did approach unto God! He did come near! No, He
   remains near--able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
   Him! He has passed under the cloud and the darkness and through the
   consuming fire--and now He is the Lamb in the midst of the Throne of
   God! He has gone into the Holy of Holies and revealed the Mercy Seat.
   He has bridged the great gulf which sin had made! "It is finished," He
   said, before He bowed His head and gave up the ghost.

   As a result, the pathway is open! Every gulf is filled! Every valley is
   exalted and every mountain and hill laid low! It is finished--the way
   from man to God has been already trod by myriads of cleansed feet, for
   our Glorious One has cast up the king's highway and made straight paths
   for our feet! Come, let us tread the road. With holy confidence let us
   draw near unto God! Our Lord, with all His heart, desired to do this.
   He "engaged His heart" to perform it. Before all worlds, His master
   purpose was to approach unto God as man's Representative. He is styled,
   "the Lamb slain from before the foundations of the world," because this
   was the firm resolve and bent of His entire Being, before ever the
   earth was!

   He had vowed in His soul that He would restore the banishment of the
   Fall and bridge the distance between man and God. When God would not
   have sacrifice and offering at man's hands, then Jesus said, "Lo, I
   come." He says of Himself, "The Lord God will help Me; therefore shall
   I not be confounded: therefore have I set My face like a flint, and I
   know that I shall not be ashamed." His heart was determined and
   resolved, for so the expression means, when the text says, "He engaged
   His heart." But why this readiness, this eagerness? Love is the one
   reply! His heart was occupied with love to God and love to man and He
   could not rest till He had restored the broken concord between these
   divided ones. With all

   the forcefulness of His Divine Nature and with all the energy of His
   perfect Humanity, He was resolved to bring men back to God.

   While He was yet a boy He felt bound to be about His Father's business.
   When He first appeared among the multitude it was by submission to the
   Father's ordinance to fulfill all righteousness. He could not hold His
   peace or take rest because His mission was urgent and His heart was in
   it. Many a time He set aside a crown to bear a cross. All the kingdoms
   of this world could not bribe Him from His sacred purpose, though
   displayed before Him by the arch-tempter in a sudden blaze of
   brightness. If any endeavored to dissuade Him from His purpose, even
   though they did it out of love, He saw the evil spirit who was using
   them as his instruments and, with indignation, He broke the snare! Even
   though it were the beloved Peter, He looked on him as the devil's
   advocate, and said, "Get you behind Me, Satan."

   How full of meaning is that sigh, "I have a baptism to be baptized
   with; and how am I straitened till it is accomplished!" He was shut up
   like a man in a narrow prison and His only enlargement was to be by
   anguish and death. He was straitened till He could give Himself up as a
   Sacrifice and so open a door for us to our God! The insatiable desire
   of our Lord's vehement spirit was the finishing of the work which the
   Father had given Him to do. It was His meat and His drink to accomplish
   the purpose of love. "Who is this?" "Who is this?" The more I turn it
   over and think of it, the more I am astonished that so condescending,
   gracious and glorious a work should engage the heart of the Lord of
   All!

   We had not loved Him, but He loved us! We were His enemies, but what a
   Friend was He! Our hearts were set on wandering, but His heart was
   engaged to bring us near to God! Let us each pause, here, and admire as
   we say, "He loved me and gave Himself for me." Who is this that thus
   has spent His love upon so poor a being? Having thus determined that He
   would approach unto God on our behalf, He took all the consequences. A
   correct reading of the passage would be, "Who is this that has pledged
   His heart or His life to approach unto Me, says the Lord?" If you take
   the meaning of the word, "heart," to be "life," since the heart is the
   source of life, then we read that our Lord pledged His life, put His
   life in surety that He would approach unto God, the Judge of All, and
   bring us near to Him.

   When He came as the Representative of sinful men--then vengeance with
   its sword must smite Him--and He was willing to be smitten. Voluntarily
   He gave His back to the smiters and His cheeks to them that plucked off
   the hair. He did not hide His face from shame and spitting. He must die
   if He draws near to God for sinful men, for such is the penalty due.
   But He willingly laid down His life and, bowing His head, He gave up
   the ghost. He must be deserted of God and He even submits to that, till
   He cries, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" He might have
   drawn back from His undertaking if He would, but He never thought of
   drawing back. With desire He desired to eat that Passover!

   In order to die, He broke off in the middle of a discourse, saying,
   "Arise, let us go therefore." His slogan was, "The cup which My Father
   has given Me, shall I not drink it?" He saved others, but Himself He
   could not save because Love held Him bound in her chains. How intensely
   ought we to love Jesus since He thus reckoned nothing too hard or
   heavy, that He might appear in the Presence of God for us and make a
   way to God for poor sinners such as we are! He even delighted in
   suffering and dishonor for this end. "For the joy that was set before
   Him, He endured the Cross, despising the shame." He made pledge, not
   merely of hands or eyes, but of His heart and life! He came with His
   life in His hands before Jehovah's face and gave up that life that He
   might remove from us the death penalty due to justice--and so reconcile
   us to the Lord of All!

   Tune your harps, you angels! Make this Sabbath on which we think of
   this sublime mystery a special festival of song! Oh, sing unto the
   Lord, you redeemed ones who see His face! You are before the Throne of
   Glory because He stood before the throne of vengeance and made it
   possible for your robes to be washed white as snow! As for you, you
   redeemed with blood who are still below, bring forth your loudest notes
   and praise Him who has once and for all cleared the way and opened an
   avenue of Grace for you! Who is this wonderful Savior? Who shall
   declare the generation of Him who pledged His life that He might draw
   near to God for us and endured all the consequences to the bitter end?

   And now, today, Beloved, Jesus Christ rejoices to think that He has
   approached unto God on our behalf and made eternal amity between God
   and man! Let us rejoice with Him! Let us become happy in fellowship
   with our God--

   "'Tis finished all; the veil is rent,

   The welcome sure, the access free;

   Now then, we leave our banishment,

   O Father, to return to Thee!"

   This is the joy of Christ's heart forever! He welcomes our return to
   God! He is glad when our communion is hearty and continuous! By His
   Holy Spirit He draws us near! Blessed be His name!

   III. Let me try, and may the Spirit of God help me, TO AWAKEN YOUR
   INTEREST IN THE SWEET RESULTS

   OF JESUS CHRIST'S HAVING APPROACHED GOD FOR US. The first result is
   found in the chapter. Read that 22nd

   verse. Read it with your own eyes and wonder that it should be put
   there. "Who is this that engaged His heart to approach unto Me? says
   the Lord. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God." That is,
   because our royal High Priest approached unto God for us, therefore we
   who were called outcasts; we whose wound was incurable and grievous; we
   that were utterly ruined and undone--we, believing in this
   Jesus--shall, in Him, become the people of God!

   Let me speak plainly with you, beloved Brothers and Sisters--how many
   of you have realized this? It is all idle for me to talk about Christ
   making the way unless you run in the way. Are you the Lord's people?
   Many of you humbly rejoice in this high honor, but there may be a few
   here who are of another mind--you care nothing for having the Lord to
   be your God. Possibly you sneer and call it cant. Yes, but if you knew
   the Truth of God you would not do so. When we hear you speaking
   contemptuously of being God's people, all we can say is, "Father,
   forgive them, for they know not what they do." Will you mind thinking
   just for half a minute? Will you try to think justly and rightly? Must
   it not be good and right that the creature should love the Creator?
   Must it not be a wise thing that the children whom God has formed
   should love their heavenly Father and be on good terms with Him? Is it
   not likely that it would be a happy thing for you if you were one of
   God's people? You can never rest till you are!

   But you ask, "How can I be?" Why, it all follows upon what I have been
   talking of! Jesus Christ went to the Father for us, that we might
   approach unto the Father in Him and through Him, that we might become
   the Lord's own people and that the Lord might become our God! I tell
   you I would sooner say, "This God is my God," than anything else that I
   can imagine! To say, "This kingdom is my kingdom," or, "This whole
   world is mine," were a miserable business compared with saying, "My
   Beloved is mine and I am His!" You would not think I exaggerated if you
   tried it! I invite you to an honest, practical test.

   See if there is not joy in the salvation of God. Religion is, with some
   people, a sort of dreamy thing on Sundays-- you sit in your pews and
   bear with us long-winded talkers about things which you do not care
   for. Oh, if only you did value and enjoy them! If you could but taste
   and handle them you would say, "Go on, Preacher! Go on! You are a poor
   hand at it, for your themes are so great and wondrous that you cannot
   reach to them, but, still, go on! Ring that bell again! Open more doors
   and let us peep in upon the secret treasures. Bring us more clusters of
   the grapes of Eshcol and let us, at least, pluck a berry here and there
   if we cannot carry away a whole cluster--and so fill our mouths with
   the inexpressible delight of being God's people and having Jehovah to
   be our God!"

   This bliss comes to those of us who rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no
   confidence in the flesh because Jesus said, "I will wait upon the Lord
   that hides His face from the house of Jacob." The face of the Lord is
   no longer hidden from us! We have access with confidence into this
   Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the Glory of God. I seem
   to see in my spirit that old legend of Rome worked out in very deed. So
   says the story--in the Roman Forum there gaped a vast chasm which
   threatened the destruction of the Forum, if not of Rome. The wise men
   declared that the gulf would never close unless the most precious thing
   in Rome was cast into it. See how it yawns and cracks, every moment,
   more horribly! Hasten to bring this noblest thing! For love of Rome
   sacrifice your best!

   But what, or who is this? Where is a treasure meet for sacrifice? Then
   Curtins, a belted knight, mounted his charger and, rightly judging that
   valor and love of country were the noblest treasures of Rome, he leaped
   into the gulf! The yawning earth closed upon a great-hearted Roman, for
   her hunger was appeased. Perhaps it is but an idle tale, but what I
   have declared is the Truth of God! There gaped between God and man a
   dread abyss, deep as Hell, wide as eternity and only the best thing
   that Heaven contained could fill it! That best thing was He, the
   peerless Son of God, the matchless, perfect Man and He came, laying
   aside His Glory, making Himself of no reputation. And He sprang into
   the gulf which then and there closed, once and for all!--

   "Down from the shining seats above With joyful haste He fled, Entered
   the grave in mortal flesh, And dwelt among the dead. Oh, for this love
   let rocks and hills

   Their lasting silence break

   And all harmonious human tongues

   The Sa vior's praises speak."

   One great result of Christ's having died is to leave us a way of access
   which is freely opened to every poor, penitent sinner. Come! Are you
   using that way of access? Do you use it every day? Having used it and
   thus having drawn near to God, do you dwell near to God? Do you abide
   in God? Is God the main thought of your life, the chief delight and
   object of your being? If it is not so, I earnestly invite you, by the
   Spirit's help, to make it so. You must engage your heart to come to God
   in Christ. There is no coming to God without sincere resolve and eager
   desire. Are you engaged to such an end? Alas, it may be you are drawn
   elsewhere. Are you engaged? Alas, some are engaged to Madame Bubble!
   Some are engaged to Belial! Some are engaged to self! Some are engaged
   to Mammon! Some seem engaged to the very devil of Hell!

   Be wise and break these unlawful engagements! Let your covenant with
   death be broken and your league with Hell be annulled. Though you are
   weary of my words, yet would I stir you up to interest in this
   all-important matter. Break these deadly bands asunder! God help you,
   by a sudden energy which He shall give you, to snap your fetters once
   and for all and then, at once, firmly engage your hearts to Christ!
   Never such loveliness, never such love will you find elsewhere! Come,
   say now--Whatever else I do or do not do, I will do this--I will
   approach to God by the way that Christ has opened for me--I will arise
   and go to my Father! I will throw myself at my Father's feet--I must be
   reconciled! I cannot live an enemy to Him! I must be made a friend--

   "I will approach You-- I will force

   My way through obstacles to You." Jesus goes before me and I gladly
   follow. I will not leave the throne till You, O Lord, have said, "I
   have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindness
   have I drawn you." I shall be greatly happy, I shall be exceedingly
   glad if I may induce one spirit to come to God by Jesus Christ! But if
   the whole of you will come at once; if God's spirit shall now prompt
   all Believers to come and all unbelievers to become Believers, and so
   to come, what a splendid company of us will enter into the golden
   gates! And what joy there will be in Heaven over all of us as we
   approach unto the Most High! I think I note a seraph, as he takes down
   his harp, stand in the center of the heavenly choir and suggest to his
   fellow choristers that their theme should be, "Who is this that has
   engaged His heart to approach unto the living

   God?"

   Hark how ten thousands of voices say--"Who is this?" Let us, in humble
   notes, lift up our praises. Here is a verse which may serve our turn--

   "Who is this that enters Glory, Clearing for His saints a way? Who
   shall tell the wondrous story Who His glorious work display? Jesus
   makes our access clear, To the Father brings us near."

   Thus the question, "Who is this?" admits of a second answer, for now,
   in Christ Jesus, all Believers with engaged hearts are approaching unto
   God! Who is this? At first it is Jesus, Son of Man and Son of God. And
   next it is His Church with all her heart engaged, approaching unto God
   by Jesus Christ! My Hearers, can you join in the song of praise which
   is now rising from Heaven and earth? Angels are waiting till you
   approach their God! Come, hurry up! Hasten to be blest! At once
   approach your God by Christ Jesus and as angels see you coming, their
   song shall grow yet louder till it shall excel the noise of many waters
   and out-voice the last great thundering! They come! They come! Sinners
   are coming to God! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.

                        Brought Up from the Horrible Pit

   A Sermon

   (No. 1674)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, August 13th, 1882, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my
   cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
   clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. And he
   hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall
   see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.'Psalm 40:1-3.

   THIS PASSAGE HAS BEEN USED with great frequency as the expression of
   the experience of the people of God, and I think it has been very
   rightly so used. It is a very accurate picture of the way in which
   sinners are raised up from despair to hope and salvation, and of the
   way in which saints are brought out of deep troubles, and made to sing
   of divine love and power. Yet I am not certain that the first verse
   could be truthfully uttered by all of us; I question, indeed, whether
   any of us could thus speak. Could we say'I waited patiently for the
   Lord.' Think ye, brethren, might it not read'I waited impatiently for
   the Lord,' in the case of most of us? All the rest may stand true, but
   this would need to be modified. We could hardly speak in our own
   commendation if we considered our conduct in the matter of patience,
   for that is, alas, still a scarce virtue'upon the face of the earth. If
   we read the psalm through we shall see that it was not written
   exclusively to describe the experience of God's people. Secondarily we
   may regard it as David's language, but in the first instance a greater
   than David is here. The first Person who uttered these words was the
   Messiah, and that is quite clear if you read the psalm through; for we
   fall upon such language as this: Sacrifice and offering, Thou didst not
   desire; mine ears hast Thou opened; burnt offering and sin offering
   hast Thou not required. Then said I, come I in the volume of the book
   it is written of Me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law
   is within my heart.' We need not say with the Ethiopian, Of whom
   speaketh the prophet this? Of himself or of some other?' For we are led
   at once by the plainest indications to see that He is not speaking of
   Himself, but of our Lord and if we needed confirmation of this we get
   it in Hebrews 10, where Paul expressly quotes this passage as referring
   to the Lord Jesus. To Him, indeed, alone of all men can it with
   accuracy be applied. So this morning I shall have to show that this
   text of ours is most fit to be the language of the Lord, our
   representative and covenant Head. When I have shown this, you will then
   see how we can use the self-same expressions, because we are in Him.
   Each believer becomes a mirror in which is reflected the experience of
   our Lord; but it would be ill for us to be so taken up with the mere
   reflection as to forget the express image by which this experience is
   formed in us.

   I shall ask you, then, at this time, to observe our divine Lord when in
   His greatest trouble. Notice, first, our Lord's behavior'I waited
   patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry':
   then consider, secondly, our Lord deliverance, expressed by the phrase,
   He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay,' and
   so forth: then let us think, thirdly of the Lord's reward for it'many
   shall see, and fear, and trust in the Lord':'that is His great end and
   object, and in it He sees of the travail of His soul and is satisfied.
   We shall close, fourthly, by perceiving the Lord's likeness in all His
   saved ones; for they also are brought up from the pit of destruction,
   and a new song is put into their mouths. He is not ashamed to call them
   brethren, since in each one of them his own experience is repeated
   though upon a smaller scale.

   I. First, let us think of OUR LORD'S BEHAVIOR. I waited patiently for
   the Lord.' Here we greatly need the teaching of the Holy Ghost; may it
   be given us abundantly. First, our Lord's conduct when He was under the
   smarting rod was that of waiting. He waited upon the Lord all His life,
   and this waiting became more conspicuous in His passion and death. He
   went down into Gethsemane, and there He prayed earnestly; but with
   sweet submission; for He said, Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou
   wilt.' Complete submission was the essential spirit of His prayer. He
   rose up from prayer all crimson with His bloody sweat, and He went to
   meet His foes, delivering Himself up voluntarily to be led as a sheep
   to the slaughter. He did not unsheathe the sword as Peter did; much
   less did He flee, like His disciples, but He waited upon the will of
   the Most High, enduring all things till the Father should give Him
   deliverance. When they took Him before Annas and Caiaphas, and Pilate
   and Herod, hurrying Him from bar to bar, how patiently He kept silence,
   though false witnesses appeared against Him. Like a sheep before her
   shearers He was dumb, submitting Himself without a struggle. In the
   omnipotence of patience He held His Peace even from good, because it
   was so written of Him. When they led Him away to crucifixion through
   the streets of Jerusalem He did not even encourage the lamentations of
   the sympathizing women who surrounded him; but in His wondrous patience
   He said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me.' He did not refuse to
   bear His cross, or to let the cross bear Him. He did not complain of
   contempt and contumely, since these were appointed Him. When they
   nailed Him to the tree, and there He hung in the burning sun, tortured,
   fevered, agonizing, the words that escaped Him were those of murmuring
   and repining, but those of pity, pain, patience, and submission. Till
   He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost, He bowed His whole being to
   His Father's will, waiting His time and pleasure. He steadily took a
   long draft at the appointed cup, and drained it to the bitter end. His
   eyes were unto the Lord as the eyes of servants are to the hands of
   their masters; He waited in service, in hope, in resignation, and in
   confidence. He knew that God would help Him and deliver Him, He knew
   that His head would be raised on high above the sons of men; but still
   He waited for the Father's time, and meanwhile made Himself of no
   reputation, and took upon Himself the form of a servant, and as a
   servant yielded all His strength to the work which was given Him to do.
   He was willing in the hour of His passion to be treated as the scum and
   scorn of all mankind, nor did He hurry the hour when all the shame and
   scorn should blossom into glory and honor. He went down in His waiting
   even to the utmost of self-denial, and truly proved that He came not to
   do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him. Never man served
   and waited like this man.

   Our text adds to this word waited' the word patiently.' I waited
   patiently.' If you would see patience, look not at Job on the dunghill,
   but look at Jesus on the cross. Job, the most patient of men, was
   assuredly impatient at the same time; but this blessed Lord of ours
   gave Himself up completely, and showed not the slightest sign of
   repining. Not a speck of impatience can be detected in the crystal
   stream of our Lord's submission. His soul was all melted, and it all
   flowed into the mold of the Father's will: no dross was in or about
   Him, nothing which refused to melt and to run into the mold. One would
   have supposed that He would have spoken an angry word to Judas, who
   betrayed Him; instead of which He gently asked of Him, Friend,
   wherefore art thou come?' It would not have seemed wonderful if He had
   upbraided the Jews who so falsely accused Him, or the rulers who so
   unjustly treated Him; but here is the patience of the saintly One, He
   was perfect master of His own Spirit. His answer to His murderers was
   the prayer, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' So
   meek and lowly in heart was He that to men He gave no sharp replies:
   His answers were all steeped in gentleness; take for example His word
   to the high priest: If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil;
   but if well, why smitest thou me?' They sat down around the cross and
   mocked Him, jeered at Him, insulted over Him, and made mirth even of
   His cries and prayers; but He did not utter a single word of rebuke,
   much less did He leap from the cross to dash His mockers in pieces, and
   prove by their destruction that He was indeed the mighty Son of God. I
   waited patiently,' saith He. No thought or word or deed of impatience
   can be charged upon Him; waiting, He waited, and waited still. We are
   in such a hurry when we are in trouble; we hasten to escape from it at
   once; every minute seems an hour, and every day an age. Help me
   speedily, my God!' is the natural cry of the child of God under the
   rod; but our Saviour was in no ill haste to get from the chastisement
   which came upon Him for our sakes: He was at leisure in His woe. So
   thoroughly was He resolved to do His Father's will that even on the
   morning of His resurrection He arose with deliberation, and quitted the
   grave in order, folding His grave'clothes and laying the napkin by
   itself. He steadily persevered in all His work of holiness and sorrow
   of sacrifice, never accepting deliverance till His work was done.
   Patiently He endured to have His ear bored to the door-post, to have
   His head encircled with thorns, His cheeks disdained with spittle, His
   back furrowed with the lash, His hands and feet nailed to the wood, and
   His heart pierced with the spear. In His body on the tree patience was
   written out in crimson characters.

   Now, this was needful for the completeness of His atonement. No
   expiation could have been made by an impatient Saviour. Only a perfect
   obedience could satisfy the law; only an unblemished sacrifice could
   put away our sins. There must not, therefore, be about our Substitute a
   trace of resistance to the Father's will, nor as a sacrifice must He
   struggle against the cords, or turn His head away from the sacrificial
   knife. In truth, His was a willing, patient doing and suffering of the
   divine will. He gave His back to the smiters and His cheeks to them
   that plucked off the hair: He hid not His face from shame and
   spitting.' I waited patiently for the Lord,' saith He; and you know,
   brethren, how true was the declaration.

   But while the Saviour thus waited, and waited patiently, we must not
   forget that He waited prayerfully, for the text speaks of a cry which
   He lifted up, and of God's inclining Himself to it. That patience which
   does not pray is obstinacy. A soul silent to God is apt to be sullen
   rather than submissive. A stoical patience hardens itself against
   grief, and asks no deliverance; but that is not the patience which God
   loves, it is not the patience of Christ. He used strong crying and
   tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death. Let Gethsemane
   tell of that wrestling which infinitely excelled the wrestling of
   Jacob: Jabbok is outdone by Kedron. His was a wrestling, not to sweat
   alone, but unto sweat of blood: he sweats who works for bread, the
   staff of life; but He sweats blood who works for life itself. What
   prayers those must have been under such a fearful physical, mental, and
   spiritual agony which were so fervent that they brought an angel from
   the throne, and yet so submissive that they are the model of
   resignation. He agonized as earnestly as if He sought His own will, and
   yet He wholly resigned Himself to the Father, saying, Lo, I come: in
   the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O
   my God.' Our Lord was always praying: there never was a moment in His
   life in which He was not in full communion with God, unless we except
   the period when He cried, Why hast thou forsaken me?' He did often go
   aside to pray a more special prayer, but yet even when He spoke to the
   people, even when He faced His foes, His soul was still in constant
   fellowship with His Father. But ah, when He came between the upper and
   the nether millstones, when this good olive was ground in the olive
   press, and all the oil of His life was extracted from Him, then it was
   that His strong crying and tears came up before the Lord His God, and
   He was heard in that He feared.

   Now, brothers and sisters, look at your pattern, and see how far short
   you have come of it. At least, I will remember with regret how far
   short I have come of it. Have we waited? Have we not been in too great
   a hurry? Has it not been too much our desire that the Lord might make
   His will like our will rather than make our will like His? Have you not
   had a will of your own sometimes, and a strong will too? Have you not
   been as the bullock unaccustomed to the yoke? Have you not kicked
   against the pricks? You have not waited, but you have worried. Can we
   say that we waited patiently? Oh, that patience! Every man thinks he
   has it until he needs it, but only let his tender point be touched, and
   you will see how little patience he possesses. It is the fire which
   tires our supposed resignation, and under that process much of our
   palace of patience burns like wood, hay, and stubble. Old crosses fit
   the shoulder, but let a new cross be laid upon us and we writhe under
   it. Suffering is the vocation of a Christian, but most of us come short
   of our high calling. Our Lord Jesus has joined together reigning and
   suffering, for we read of the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ'; He
   was the royal example of patience, but what are we? Remember, again,
   that Jesus prayed importunately while He waited: being in an agony, he
   prayed more earnestly.' Have we not at time restrained prayer? Have we
   not pleaded as an excuse for our feeble petitions the very facts which
   ought to have been a spur to our earnestness? I felt too ill to pray.'
   Coldest thou not pray for health with all the more fervency? I felt too
   burdened to pray.' Shouldst thou not pray for help to bear thy burden?
   Can we ever safely say to ourselves, I may be excused from supplication
   now, for my sorrow is great.' Talk not so. Here is thy balm and
   benediction, thy comfort and thy cordial: here is thy strength and
   succor, thy constancy and confidence. Even in the midnight of the soul
   let us arise and pour out our hearts like water before the Lord. O
   tried believer, get thee to thy knees, and from above the mercy-seat
   the glory of the Lord shall shine forth upon thee. Pray even as Jesus
   did, and as all His saints have done, so shall you in patience possess
   your soul. In due time the Lord inclined to the afflicted suppliant,
   listening to his moaning from the bottom of the pit; of this it is high
   time for us to speak. Yet let us not leave this first point till we
   learn from the example of our Lord that patience is seen in waiting as
   well as in suffering. To bear a great weight for an hour or two is
   nothing compared with carrying a load for many a day. Patience knows
   its letters, but waiting reads the page, and praying rehearses it in
   the ears of God. Let us add to our patience waiting, and to waiting
   prayer.

   II. We come, secondly, to consider OUR LORD'S DELIVERANCE. In due time,
   when patience had had her perfect work, and prayer had at last
   prevailed, our suffering Lord was brought up again from the deeps of
   sorrow. His deliverance is set forth under two images.

   First, it is represented as a bringing up out of a horrible pit. It is
   a terribly suggestive metaphor. I have been in the dungeon in Rome in
   which, according to tradition, Peter and Paul were confined (though,
   probably, they were never there at all). It was indeed a horrible pit,
   for originally it had no entrance but a round hole in the rock above;
   and when that round hole at the top was blocked with a stone, not a ray
   of light nor a particle of fresh air could possibly enter. The
   prisoners were let down into the cavern, and there they were left. When
   once the opening was closed they were cut off from all communication
   with their fellow men. No being has ever been so cruel to man as man.
   Man is the worst of monsters to his kind, and his cruel inventions are
   many. He has not been content to leave his fellows their natural
   liberty, but he built prisons and digged pits in which to shut up his
   victims. At first they would place a man in a dry well merely for
   custody and confinement, or they would drop him into some hollow cavern
   in the earth in which corn or treasure had been concealed; but
   afterwards with greater ingenuity of malice they covered over the top
   of these pits so that the prisoners could not be partakers of God's
   bountiful air, or the merciful light of the sun, or the silver sheen of
   the moon. Covered all over and shut in, the captives were buried alive.
   Even in modern times we have seen what they call oubliettes, or
   dungeons in which prisoners were immured, to be forgotten as dead men
   out of mind, buried so as never to come forth again. Such unfortunates
   as were doomed to enter these tombs of living men bade farewell to
   hope. They were inhabitants of oblivion, dwellers in the land of death
   shade, to remain apart from their kind, cut off from memory. These
   worst of dungeons may illustrate our text'He brought me up also out of
   a horrible pit.'

   In the original we get the idea of a crash, as when some mailed warrior
   in the midst of the battle stumbles into a pit, and there he lies
   bruised and broken: and there is the thought of the fall of waters
   rushing strangely, furiously, mysteriously. The Hebrew hath it, The pit
   of noises,' or as some render it, the pit of destruction.' Such was the
   condition of our dear Redeemer when He was bearing our sin and
   suffering in our stead.

   Just notice, first, that our Lord was like a man put into a pit, and so
   made to be quite alone. Imagine yourself now confined in one of those
   caverns, with the big stone rolled over the mouth of it. There would be
   neither hearing nor answering. Now will you know the dread solemnity of
   silence. You may speak, but no gentle whisper of sympathy will reach
   your ears in return; you may cry again and again and make the dungeon's
   dome echo to your voice, but you are speaking as to brass'no man cares
   for your soul. You are alone; alone in a fearful solitude. Thus it
   happened to our Saviour. All His disciples forsook Him and fled, and
   what was infinitely worse, His God forsook Him too. He cried, My God,
   my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' Can any man tell me all that was
   meant by that infinite lament?

   Of course, a prisoner in such a pit as that was in total darkness. He
   could not see the walls which enclosed him, nor so much as his own
   hand. No beam of sunlight ever wandered into that stagnant air; the
   captive would have to grope for the pitcher of water and the morsel of
   bread which a cruel mercy would allot to him. Our Lord was in the dark;
   midnight brooded over His spirit. He said'Now is my soul troubled.' My
   soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.' His was a pit of gloom,
   the region of the shadow of death, a land of darkness as darkness
   itself

   When a man is shut up in a pit he is, of course, full of distress. If
   you were, any of you, to go into one of the solitary cells of our own
   jails, I warrant you a short sojourn in it would be quite enough. These
   cells some years ago were thought to be wonderful cures for all sort of
   evil dispositions in men, but probably they have oftener destroyed
   reason than conquered depravity. Go in, if you dare. Ask the warder to
   shut to the door, and leave you in the dark all alone, that you may try
   the solitary system for yourself. No, I should not advise you to try it
   even for five minutes, for you might even in that short pace inflict
   such an injury upon your nervous system as you would never recover. I
   believe that many of the gentler ones here would be quite unable to
   bear total darkness and solitude even for the shortest space. In the
   grim gloom the soul is haunted with phantom fears, while horror peoples
   the place which is empty of human beings; the heart is worried with
   evil imaginations, and pierced with arrows of distress; grief takes
   hold of the spirit, and alarm conquers hope. In our Lord's case, the
   grief and sorrow which He felt can never be described, nor need it be
   conceived. It was something tantamount to the miseries of damned souls.
   The holy Jesus could not feel the exact misery which takes hold on
   abandoned rebels, but He did suffer what was tantamount to that at the
   judgment'seat of God. He gave a quid pro quo, a something which in
   God's esteem, reckoning the dignity of His mighty person, stood instead
   of the sinner's eternal suffering. He felt woe upon woe, night
   blackening night. Do not try to realize His agony; He wills that you
   should note, for He has trodden the winepress alone, and of the people
   there we're none with Him, as if to show that none could understand His
   sorrows, and that we can do no more than speak of His unknown
   sufferings.'

   But I must add, to complete the figure, that shut up in such a pit
   there might be a great tumult above, like to the tramping of armed
   hosts, or there might be a rush of waters underneath the captive deep
   in earth's bowels. He could not tell what the noise was, nor whence it
   came; and hence he would often be in terrible fear while he sat alone
   in the thick darkness. Our lord had His fears, for we read that He was
   heard in that He feared. Torrents of sin rushed near Him; floods of
   wrath were heard around Him, and cataracts of grief fell upon Him.
   Besides, there was a mystery about this anguish which intensified it'a
   mystery not to be written or explained. Our Redeemer's spirit was cast
   down within Him far beyond anything that is common to men; in that
   horrible pit, that pit of destruction, He lay with none to pity or
   sustain.

   But, Oh, change the strain, and sing unto the Lord awhile, as we read
   the verse, He brought me up out of a horrible pit.' The Lord Jesus
   Christ was lifted up from all sorrow of spirit at that moment when He
   said so bravely, It is finished,' and though He died yet was He lifted
   up from death, as it is written, Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;
   neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.' His Spirit
   ascended to God, and by-and-by, when the third day had blushed with
   morning light, His body rose from the tomb, to ascend in due time to
   glory. He came up out of the pit of the grave, delivered from all fear
   of corruption, pain, or defeat. Now His sorrow is ended, and His brow
   is clear from care. His visage is marred no more: He bears the scars
   which do but illumine His hands and feet with splendor, but

   No more the bloody spear,

   The cross and nails no more,

   For hell itself shakes at his name,

   And all the heavens adore.

   Sing ye unto the Lord, ye saints of His, as ye behold your Master
   brought up again from among the sorrowful, the despised, the deserted,
   the dead.

   A second figure is, however, used here to express our Lord's grief and
   deliverance from it'Out of the miry clay.' Travelers tell us that
   wherever pits are still used as dungeons, they are damp, foul and
   utterly loathsome; for they are never cleansed, however long the
   prisoner may have been there, or however great the number of victims
   shut up within them. You know what the prisons of Europe were in
   Howard's days, they were even worse in the East in periods further
   back. The imprisoned wretch often found himself sinking in more; he
   found no rest, no hope of comfort, and when extricated he needed a hand
   to drag him out of the thick clay. Our blessed Lord and Master found
   Himself when He was suffering for us where everything appeared to give
   way beneath Him; His spirits sank, His friends failed Him, and His
   heart melted like wax. Every comfort was taken from Him. His blessed
   manhood found nothing upon this earth upon which it could stay itself,
   for He had been made sin for us, made a curse for us, and so every
   foundation of comfort departed from Him. He was deprived of visible
   support, and reduced to a sad condition. As a man who has fallen into a
   slough cannot stir so as to recover himself, so was it with our
   Redeemer, who says in the Psalms'I sink in deep mire, where there is no
   standing.' Some morasses are so destructive that, if a man should once
   fall into them, he might give up his life for lost unless some one came
   that way to drag him out. So did the Saviour sink in the miry clay of
   our sin and misery until the Lord Almighty lifted Him out. The clay of
   sorrow clung to Him; it held to Him while He was performing the great
   work of our redemption. But the Lord brought Him up out of it. There is
   no mire upon His garments now: his feet no longer sink, He is not held
   by the bands of death, He slides not into the grave again. He was
   dragged down, as it were, by hearing our sin, but that is over, and He
   hath ascended on high: He hath led captivity captive, and received
   gifts from men. All honor be unto Him, and to His Father who delivered
   Him.

   As we read our text we pursue this story of out Master's deliverance,
   and we are told that He was brought up out of the lowest deeps. Say the
   words or sing them as you choose'He brought me up.' God upraised His
   obedient Son from the depths into which He had descended on our
   account. He was brought up, like Jonah who went to die bottom of the
   mountains, and yet was landed safely on the shore. He was brought up
   like Joseph, who rose from a pit to a palace; like David, who was led
   up from the sheepfold to the kingdom. The king shall joy in thy
   strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
   His glory is great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast thou laid
   upon him. For thou hast made him most blessed forever: Thou hast made
   him exceeding glad with thy countenance.'

   Then we are told He was set on a rock, and oh, the glory of our blessed
   Lord in this matter, for now He stands on a firm foundation in all that
   He does for us. Judgment and truth confirm His ways, and the Judge of
   all the earth approves His doings. Christ has no sandy foundation for
   His work of mercy or His word of comfort. When He saves He has a right
   to save: when He puts away sin He does it on indisputable grounds: when
   He helps and delivers His people He does it according to law, according
   to the will of the Highest. As Justifier, Preserver, and Perfecter of
   His people, He stands upon a rock. This day I delight to think of my
   Lord as settling His church with Himself upon the immutable foundations
   of the covenant, on the decree of God, on the purpose of the Father, on
   His own work, and on the promise of God that He would reward Him in
   that work. Well may we say that His feet are upon a rock, for He is
   Himself, by another figure, the Rock of ages, the Rock of our
   salvation.

   And now the goings of our glorious Christ are established. When He goes
   out to save a sinner, He knows that He can do it, and has a right to do
   it. When He goes up to His Father's throne to make intercession for
   sinners, His goings are established, and the desire of His heart is
   given Him. When He comes in among His church, or marches forth with his
   people to the ends of the earth, His goings are established. For the
   king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he
   shall not be moved.' He shall surely come a second time without sin
   unto salvation, for so has the Father decreed: His glorious goings are
   as surely established as were those of His labor and suffering. We
   shall never be without a Saviour: we shall never have a fallen or a
   vanquished Saviour; for His goings are established for continuance,
   certainty, and victory. Such honor have all His saints; for the steps
   of a good man are ordered of the Lord'; and again, none of his steps
   shall slide.'

   Best of all, there is a new, song in the mouth of our Well-beloved. It
   is grand to think of Jesus singing. Read the twenty-second Psalm, and
   you will find Him doing it, as also in the Hebrews: In the midst of the
   church will I sing praise unto thee.' Toward the end of His earthly
   career you hear Him bursting into song. Was not that a grand occasion
   just before His passion, when He was going out to die; we read that
   after supper they sang a hymn.' If we had been bound to die that night,
   as He was, we should rather have wept or prayed than sang. Not so our
   Lord. I do not know what psalm they sang: probably a part of the great
   Hallel, usually sung after the Passover, which consists of those Psalms
   at the end of the book which are so full of praise. I believe the
   Saviour Himself pitched the tune and led the strain. Think of Him
   singing when near His hour of agony! Going to scorn and mockery,
   singing! Going to the thorn-crown and the scourge, singing! Going to
   death, even the death of the cross, singing! For the joy that was set
   before Him He endured the cross, despising the shame! But now, what
   must that new song be which He leads in heaven? They sang, as it were,
   a new song before the throne'; but it is He that leads the heavenly
   orchestra. How greatly He excels Miriam, the sister of Moses, when she
   took her timbrel and led forth the women in their dances, saying, Sing
   unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his
   rider hath he thrown into the sea.' This is called the song of Moses,
   the servant of God and of the Lamb'; so I gather that the Lamb's new
   song is after the same triumphant fashion: it is the substance of that
   which Moses' song foreshadowed. In Christ Jesus the Lord our God has
   led captivity captive. Let us praise Him on the high sounding cymbals.
   Sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously. The powers of
   darkness are destroyed; sin, death, and hell are drowned in the atoning
   blood: the depths have covered them: there is not one of them left. Oh,
   sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously.' Ascribe ye
   greatness unto our God.'

   III. Such is the exalted condition of our Lord at this hour; let us
   turn and look upon THE LORD'S REWARD. The Lord's reward for having gone
   down into the horrible pit, and having gunk in the miry clay for us, is
   this'that Many shall see, and fear, and trust in the Lord. Many!' Not
   all mankind, but many' shall look to Jesus and live. Alas! Vast numbers
   continue in unbelief, but many' shall believe and live; and the Lord's
   many' means very many. As I was thinking over my text, I thought, I
   hope there will be some at the Tabernacle this morning that belong to
   the I many who shall see and fear and trust in the Lord.' Many shall'
   for the Lord hath promised it. But, Lord, they will not. But they
   shall,' says God. Oh, but many refuse. But they shall,' says God and He
   hath the key of men's hearts, and power over their judgments and their
   wills. Many shall.' Do you, oh ye unbelievers, think that Jesus shall
   die in vain? Oh, sinners, if you will nor have Christ, others will. You
   may despise Him, but He will be none the less glorious. You may reject
   His salvation but He shall be none the less mighty to save. He is a
   king, and ye cannot pluck a single jewel from His crown. If you arc so
   foolish as to provoke His iron rod so that He shall break you in
   shivers with it, yet He will be ijorious in the sight of God, and He
   will save His own. Notwithstanding your hardness of heart, be this
   known unto you, oh House of Israel, that many shall see, and fear, and
   trust in the Lord.'

   What shall the many do? They shall see.' Their eyes shall be opened,
   and they shall see their Lord in the horrible pit, and in the miry
   clay, and as they look they shall see that He was there for them. What
   joy this will create in their spirits! If they do not see the Lord
   Jesus as their Substitute they shall, at any rate, be made to see the
   exceeding sinfulness of sin. If when Jesus only takes imputed sin, and
   has no sin of His own, yet He must be cast into the horrible pit and
   sink in the miry clay; then what will become of men who have their owns
   sins about them, provoking the fierce anger of the Lord? If God thus
   smites His well'beloved, oh sinner, how will He smite you! Beware, ye
   that forget Him, lest He tear you in pieces, and there be none to
   deliver you. By the suffering Surety all covered with His own gore, I
   do beseech you, provoke not God; for if His Only'Begotten must suffer
   so, you must suffer yet more if you break His law, and next reject His
   gospel.

   Many shall see.' Do you wonder that it is added, and shall fear?' It
   makes men fear to see a bleeding Christ, and to know that they
   crucified Him. It makes men fear, however, with a sweet filial fear
   that is akin to hope, when they see that Jesus died for sinner, the
   Just for the unjust, to bring them to God. Oh, when they see the Lord
   of love acting as a scapegoat, and bearing their sins away into the
   wilderness of forgetfulness, they begin to hate their evil ways, and to
   have a reverent fear of God; for so saith the Scripture, there is
   forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared.'

   But best of all'and this is the chief point'they come to trust in the
   Lord.' They build their hope of salvation upon the righteousness of God
   as manifested in Christ Jesus. Oh, I would to God that some of you
   would trust Him at once. Beloved friend, are you trying to be saved by
   your own works? That is a delusion. Are you hoping to be saved by your
   own feelings? That is a lie. But you can be saved, you shall be saved:
   if you will trust yourself with that blessed One who was alone in the
   dark pit of noises for the sake of sinners, and slipped in the miry
   clay for the ungodly, you shall assuredly be saved from wrath through
   Him. Trust Him, and as surely as He liveth you shall be saved; for he
   that trusteth in Him cannot perish. God's truthfulness were gone if the
   believer could be lost. Hath He not said, He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved.' The throne of God must rock and reel before
   the cross.

   IV. Fourthly, let us see THE LORD'S LIKENESS in His people. This whole
   passage, as I said in the beginning, has often been used by individual
   believers as a description of their own deliverance. It is a true
   picture, because we are made like unto our Head, and all the brethren
   are partakers of that which the Head has endured. Do I speak to any of
   my Master's servants in sore trouble? Dear friends, are you made to
   wait, though your trial is sharp and severe? Is it so that your prayer
   has not yet been answered? Then remember the waiter's place was once
   occupied by the Lord Jesus, for He says, I waited patiently.' If the
   Lord keeps you waiting for a certain blessing year after year do not
   despair. He will give it at length if it be truly for your good, for He
   hath said, no good thing will I withhold from them that walk
   uprightly.' He kept His Son waiting, and He may very well keep you in
   like posture, for how long did you delay, and cause the Lord of grace
   to wait on you! Blessed are they that wait for Him.' I have seen people
   very uppish when they have called on a public man and have had to wait
   a little; they feel that they ought not to be kept in the lobby, but
   suppose some young man said to them, I am his own son, and yet I have
   been waiting an hour.' Then they are more patient. So when God keeps
   you waiting do not be proud, and say, Wherefore should I wait for the
   Lord any longer?' but remember It is good for a man both to hope and
   quietly wait for the salvation of God.' Jesus waited'waited patiently.'
   Seek to be like Him, and in patience possess your soul. I cannot see
   how I am to be delivered.' Wait. Ah, this is such a heavy burden.'
   Wait. But I am ready to die under this terrible load.' Wait! Wait on!
   Though He tarry, wait for Him: He is worth waiting for. Wait' is a
   short word, but it takes a deal of grace to spell out its full meaning,
   and still more grace to put it in practice. Wait: wait. Oh, but I have
   been unfortunate.' Wait. But I have believed a promise, and it has not
   been fulfilled.' Wait; for you wait in blessed company: you may hear
   Jesus saying, I waited patiently.' Blessed be His name, He is teaching
   us to do the same by His gracious Spirit.

   Next, the Lord may send you, His dear child, a very heavy sorrow: you
   may fall into the horrible pit, and see no light, no comfort, and no
   one may be able to cheer you or help you. Some that have a touch of
   despondency in their nature have been brought so low as almost to
   despair of life. They have sat in darkness and seen no light: they have
   felt the walls of their prison and have not discovered a crack or
   cranny through which escape was possible: they have looked up, and even
   then they have seen nothing to console them. Ah, well, here is a word I
   commend to you'the Saviour says it: He brought me up.' The Lord God can
   and will bring up His troubled ones. You will have to write in your
   dairy one of these days. He brought me up.' I was in the dark, I was in
   the dungeon, but He brought me up.' I can personally say this with
   gladsome gratitude, for He hath brought me up,' again and again. My
   heart is glad as I reflect upon my past deliverances. I have often
   wondered why I so often shut up in prison, and bound as with fetters of
   steel; but I cease to wonder when I think of the many among you who are
   called to wear the like bonds. This is my portion, that I may be a
   witness-bearer for my God, and that I may be able to speak to the
   experiences of God's tempted people, and tell how graciously the Lord
   delivers His servants who trust in Him. Faith shall never be shamed or
   confounded, world without end. God can and will hasten to the rescue of
   the faithful. I set to my seal also that He brought me up'; and,
   beloved brother in tribulation, He will bring you up; only rest in the
   Lord, and wait patiently for Him.

   Ah,' say you, But I do not know how to stand, for I sink as in miry
   clay, through faintness of heart: I cannot find the slightest foothold
   for my hope.' No, you are sinking in the miry clay like your Master;
   but in answer to prayer the Lord will bring you up out of your hopeless
   state, and He will set your feet upon a rock and establish your goings,
   and give you joy, and peace, and delight. Wherefore see, and fear, and
   trust in God, and give glory to His blessed name.

   Lastly, do I address any seeking one who finds no rest for the sole of
   his foot? Dear friend, are you sinking in the deep mire of your guilt?
   The Lord can pardon you, for the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,
   cleanseth us from all sin.' Are you shut up by conscience in the
   prison-house under a just sense of deserved wrath? Jesus will give you
   immediate rest if you come to Him. Do you feel as if you cannot kneel
   to pray, for your very knees slip in the mire of doubt? Remember, Jesus
   makes intercession for the transgressors. Do you seem as if, every time
   you move, you are burying your hope, and slipping deeper and deeper
   into ruin? The Lord hath plenteous redemption. Do not despairs You
   cannot not deliver yourself, but God can deliver you: you cannot stand
   of yourself, but God can make you to stand. You cannot go to Him nor go
   abroad among your fellow-men with comfort, but the Lord can make you to
   run in His ways. You shall yet go forth with joy and be led forth with
   peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
   singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. Only
   see Christ, and fear and trust your God, and you too shall sing unto
   Jehovah your deliverer, and this shall be your song:'

   He raised mc from a horrid pit,

   Where mourning long I lay,

   And from my bonds released my feet,

   Deep bonds of miry clay.

   Firm on a rock he made me stand,

   And taught my cheerful tongue

   I praise tire wonders of his hand

   In a new thankful song.

Out Of Egypt

   (No. 1675)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 20, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night, and
   departed into Egypt: and was there until the death of Herod: that it
   might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying,
   Out of Egypt have I called My Son." Matthew 2:14,15.

   "When Israel was a Child, then I loved Him, and called My Son out of
   Egypt." Hosea 11:1.

   EGYPT occupies a very singular position towards Israel. It was often
   the shelter of the seed of Abraham. Abraham, himself, went there when
   there was a famine in the land of his sojourn. To Egypt, Joseph was
   taken that he might escape from the death intended for him by his
   envious brothers and become the stepfather of the house of Israel. Into
   Egypt, as we all right well know, went the whole family of Jacob--and
   there they sojourned in a strange land. There Moses acquired the
   learning which was so useful to him. It was out of the spoils of Egypt
   that the furniture of the Tabernacle was made--as if to show that God
   intended to take out of heathen hands an offering to His own
   Glory--just as, afterwards, the timber of the Temple was hewn by Hiram,
   the Phoenician, that the Gentiles might have a share in building the
   Temple in token that they would, one day, be made fellow heirs with
   Israel.

   But while Egypt was, for a while, the shelter of the house of Israel,
   it became, later, the house of bondage and a country fraught with
   danger to the very existence of the elect nation! There was a very
   useful purpose to be served by their going down into Egypt--that they
   might be consolidated into a nation and might acquire many useful arts
   which they could not have learned while they were wandering about in
   Palestine. The lesson was valuable, but it was learned in much misery.
   They had to smart beneath the lash and faint beneath their labor--the
   iron bondage entered into Israel's soul so that an exceedingly great
   and bitter cry went up to Heaven. Yet, when the heaviest burdens were
   laid on their shoulders, the day of liberty was dawning! When the tale
   of bricks was doubled, Moses was born! When man had come to his
   extremity of persecution, then God took His opportunity of salvation
   and led His Israel out of Egypt in the teeth of their tyrant master!

   It had been at first a Goshen to them, a place of great abundance in
   the Delta of the Nile, but afterwards it became a Mizraim to them, for
   that is the Hebrew word for Egypt, and it means a place of straits and
   tribulations. The point that is meant to be brought forward by the
   Prophet is that they were called out of Egypt, for it was not possible
   for them to mingle with the sons of Ham and lose their separate
   existence. They were on the banks of the Nile and, at first, dwelt
   there in much comfort, but this seductive ease was not allowed to hold
   them--full soon they were heavily oppressed and their existence was
   threatened. Yet both from the comfort of Egypt and from the captivity
   of Egypt they were called and, at the call of God, they came forth.

   The living seed may go into strange places, but it can never be
   destroyed! The host of God may walk through fire, but it shall not be
   burned! God has made the living seed immortal and it cannot die, for it
   is born of God. Out of deadly lands, where every breath is disease,
   they shall be called by the eternal Voice. Those whom God has chosen
   may be cast far away, but they shall never be cast away! They may dwell
   among a people like the Egyptians--most superstitious and debased. A
   nation of whom even the heathen Juvenal made sport when he said, "Oh,
   happy people who grow their gods in their kitchen gardens!" They
   worshipped leeks, onions, all kinds of beasts and fowls and creeping
   things, but the children of the Lord cannot be suffered to remain among
   such a people, for the Lord desires to make of Israel and of all
   Believers, a people separated unto Himself.

   Out of the midst of guilty Egypt the Lord called His people, whom He
   had formed for Himself, to show forth His praise. The abundance of
   superstition, though it was like the sea, shall not quench the spark of
   the Divine life in the living family of God! It shall burn on amidst
   the waves until the God who first enkindled it shall, by His own right
   hand, pluck it from among the billows and set it as a light upon a
   candlestick that it may give light to all that are in the house!
   Neither Egypt of old, nor Babylon, nor Rome can destroy the royal
   seed--out of all dangers, the Church must emerge the better for her
   affliction.

   "Out of Egypt have I called My Son," is a text worthy to be made a
   proverb, for it is true all through the history of the chosen seed.
   They are called out from among the surrounding race of rebels and, when
   the call comes, none can hold them back. It were easier to restrain the
   sun from rising than to hold the redeemed of the Lord in perpetual
   servitude! "The Breaker has gone up before them, and their King at the
   head of them"--who shall block up their road? God is still calling them
   out and until the very last of His elect shall be gathered in, it shall
   still stand true, "Out of Egypt"--and out of anywhere else that is like
   Egypt; out of the worst and vilest places; out of the places where they
   are held fast in bitter bondage, out of these--"have I called My Son."

   At this time I shall, first, call your attention to the text in Hosea
   according to the sense in which the Prophet first uttered it. He speaks
   of the natural seed called out from the sheltering world, for Egypt was
   a sheltering world to Israel, the natural seed, and they were called
   out of it by the Omnipotent power of God. Secondly, we shall notice the
   Divine Seed called out, literally, from a sheltering Egypt and brought
   up from it into the land of Judea, that He might be the Glory of His
   people Israel. Thirdly, we shall spend a little time in considering the
   chosen seed, those who are given unto Christ of the Father--these,
   also, must come out from the world, whether it is friendly or hostile.
   The Lord has said to them, "This is not your rest, for it is polluted."
   He is saying the same today. It is still true of the spiritual seed as
   of our Lord Jesus and of the natural seed, "Out of Egypt have I called
   My Son."

   May the Holy Spirit be our Teacher while we handle this great subject.

   I. Let us think of THE NATURAL SEED of Israel as called out of Egypt,
   for with them this wonderful text began to be expounded. It is well
   worth considering, for this constituted one of the loftiest lyrics of
   Hebrew poetry. The deliverance of the people of God out of Egypt, "with
   a high hand and with an outstretched arm," is a song which the nation
   never wearied of singing--and which we ought never to weary of singing,
   either--for at the close of all things, we and all the redeemed spirits
   shall sing the song of Moses, the servant of God and of the Lamb!

   The great redemption of the Exodus shall always be so eminent a type of
   the greater redemption upon the Cross that the two may be blended
   together and words that were sung concerning the first deliverance may
   be readily enough used as expressions of our joy in our salvation from
   death and Hell--

   "From Egypt lately come, Where death and darkness reign, Seek our new,
   our better Home, Where we our rest shall gain. Hallelujah! We are on
   our way to God."

   While speaking upon this natural seed I want you to notice, first, that
   if they are to be called out of Egypt, they must first go down into
   Egypt. They cannot come out of it if they have not first gone into it.
   I do not know of anything that could have tempted them down into Egypt,
   for it had nothing to offer which was better than Canaan, but the
   fathers of the tribes were driven there by a famine which troubled the
   whole world. The Lord sent a man before them, even Joseph, who laid up,
   in store, food for the seven years of famine, and Israel went down into
   Egypt that they might not die, but might be cherished by Joseph, who
   had become lord of the land.

   The Lord may, in order to prevent His people falling into a worse evil,
   permit them to go into that which seems hopeful, but ultimately turns
   out to be a great trial to them. Suffering is infinitely preferable to
   sinning. The Lord may, therefore, send us sorrow to keep us from
   iniquity. Dear Friend, the Lord who reads your heart may know that it
   is absolutely necessary for you to be tried--and so, spiritually, to go
   down into Egypt. He may send a famine to drive you there. He may place
   you under great tribulations and so He may bring you down both mentally
   and spiritually into a sad condition where you shall sigh and cry by
   reason of bondage.

   Do not look upon this as a strange thing, for all God's gold must pass
   through the fire! It is one of the marks of God's elect that they are
   afflicted! The Lord Jesus says, "As many as I love I rebuke and
   chasten." Depend upon it that if

   you are one of the true seed you must go down into Egypt! The Lord said
   to Abraham, "Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a
   land that is not theirs." The shield of the chosen bears the emblem of
   a smoking furnace and a burning lamp. Even if the world shelters you,
   it will sooner or later become to you the house of bondage--yet into
   that house of bondage you must go, for there is a great educational
   process going on in affliction to prepare us for the land which flows
   with milk and honey!

   Egypt is one of the early lessons. It is strangely early with
   some--their religious life begins with a cloudy morning and threat of
   storm. This will work them lasting good. "It is good for a man that he
   bear the yoke in his youth." Therefore we have, "When Israel was a
   child, then I loved Him and called My Son out of Egypt." The earliest
   days of Israel were in Egypt; the nation, in its infancy, was called
   from there. While the Divine life has not yet attained to maturity, we
   meet with straits and troubles and have to go down into Egypt and feel
   the weight of the yoke upon our shoulders. This is one of God's ways of
   preparing us for freedom, for he that has never tasted of the
   bitterness of bondage will never be able to appreciate the sweets of
   the liberty with which Christ makes men free. So Israel must first go
   down into Egypt. He descends that he may rise to greater heights!

   Note, next, that it was while in Egypt and at the worst time of their
   bondage in Egypt, that they received the first notification that the
   nation was to be called the son of God. Israel is not called a son
   until Moses comes to Pharaoh and says, "Israel is My Son, even My
   first-born: and I say unto you, Let My Son go, that He may serve Me."
   God had been with Abraham and called him His friend, but I do not
   perceive that He called him His son, or that Abraham addressed the Lord
   as, "Our Father which are in Heaven." Neither do I find similar sweet
   words flowing from the lips of Isaac or of Jacob--but when Israel was
   in bondage--then it was that the Lord revealed Israel's adoption and
   openly declared, "Israel is My Son, even My first-born."

   He scourges every son whom He receives and He receives them even while
   the scourge is sorely bruising them! They were a poor down-trod
   nation--a nation of slaves begrimed with brick-earth and bleeding
   beneath the lash of their taskmasters! The Egyptians must have utterly
   despised a people who yielded so readily to all their exactions. They
   looked upon them as a herd of slaves who had not the spirit to rebel,
   whatever cruelties they might endure. But now it is, while they are
   lying among the pots and their faces are stained with tears, that the
   Lord openly, before proud Pharaoh, owns the nation as His Son, saying,
   "Israel is My Son, even My first-born." I think I see Pharaoh's grim,
   sardonic smile as he seems to say, "Those slaves, those wretched
   brick-makers whom the lowest of my people despise--if these are
   Jehovah's first-born, what care I for Him or them?"

   Learn therefore, dear Brothers and Sisters, that God is not ashamed of
   His children when they are in their worst estate. We are told,
   concerning our Lord Jesus, "For which cause He is not ashamed to call
   them brethren." Yes, and not when they put on their beautiful array;
   when the jewels are in their ears; when they are led forth with music
   and dancing and when they shout over Egyptian chivalry drowned in the
   Red Sea will they be more the Lord's children than they are in the
   house of bondage! The Lord God speaks of their adoption for the first
   time when they are still under the oppressor and when it seems
   impossible that they can be rescued! The Lord speaks very plainly to
   the haughty Pharaoh, "Let My Son go that He may serve Me; and if you
   refuse to let Him go, behold I will slay your son, even your
   first-born."

   Oh, but is it not a blessed thing to go down into the Egypt of
   tribulation if there, for the first time, we learn our adoption of the
   Lord? Is it not a sweet thing, even, to be under the heaviest bondage
   if you are, by such means, made to understand better than you ever did
   before what it is to be a son and a heir, a joint-heir with Jesus
   Christ? The first-born of every creature is He and we are the Church of
   the First-Born whose names are written in Heaven! The heritage of the
   first-born belongs to Jesus and to us in Him--and we often know this
   best when our heart is broken because of sin and when our troubles are
   overwhelming our spirit.

   "Fear not," says He, "I will help you." "Fear not, you worm, Jacob, and
   you men of Israel; I will help you, says the Lord and your Redeemer,
   the Holy One of Israel." Yes, it was in Egyptian bondage that they
   received the first witness of the Spirit, that they were, as a people,
   the sons of God! When it became clear that they were really the sons of
   God, then they suffered persecution for it. A place which, as I have
   said, was, at first, their shelter, now became the iron furnace of
   oppression. Their hard labors are doubled; their male children were
   ordered to be cast into the river and edicts of the most intolerable
   kind were fulminated against them.

   Now, Brethren, Satan soon knows the man that God has acknowledged to be
   His son and he seeks to slay him even as Herod sought to kill Jesus.
   When the Man-Child was born, the Dragon knew who that Man-Child was and
   sought to

   destroy Him. He vomited forth floods to sweep Him away, until we read
   that the earth helped the woman and there were given to her wings of a
   great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place,
   where she is nourished from the face of the serpent. No sooner is the
   child of God really acknowledged to be such, than at once the seed of
   the serpent will hiss about him--and if they can, will cast their venom
   upon him. At any rate, they will bite at his heel till God has taught
   him, in the name of Jesus, to break the serpent's head.

   Rest assured that this is another mark of the election of Grace. All
   that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution. In
   Ishmael's case, it was seen that he that is born after the flesh
   persecutes him that is born after the Spirit, and so it is now. You
   cannot expect to pass through this Vanity Fair without exciting the
   jeers and sneers of the ungodly, for the Lord's inheritance is unto him
   as a speckled bird--the birds round about her are against her. Every
   David has his Saul; every Nehemiah his Sanballat and every Mordecai his
   Haman.

   But now comes the crown of the text, that is, "I have called My Son out
   of Egypt," and out of Egypt, Israel must come! Egypt was not Israel's
   portion--it was "a land that was not theirs." My Brothers and Sisters,
   we are not citizens of "the great city which spiritually is called
   Sodom and Egypt, where, also, our Lord was crucified." The best thing
   in this present evil world is not your portion nor mine. Friendly
   Egypt, sheltering Egypt, was not Israel's inheritance. He gave them no
   portion, even, in the land of Goshen by a covenant of salt. They might
   tarry there for a while, but out of it they must come, as it is
   written, "You have brought a vine out of Egypt." The best side of the
   world, when it seems warmest and most tender to us, is not the place
   where we may lie down with comfort.

   The bosom of our God--that is the true shelter of His people--and there
   we must find rest. If we are dwelling in the world and are tempted to
   be of the world--and to take up with the riches of Egypt--we must, by
   Grace, be taught to cast all this behind our back, for we have not our
   portion in this life, neither can we have our inheritance until we
   enter upon the life that is to come. Jacob said on his death-bed, "Bury
   me not, I pray you, in Egypt." And Joseph gave commandment concerning
   his bones that they should not remain in Pharaoh's land. Even so, the
   saints of God are weary of the world's dominions; they tremble like a
   bird out of Egypt. Not in Egypt would God reveal Himself to His people.
   What says He? "Come you out from among them: be you separate and I will
   be a Father unto you, and you shall be My sons and daughters."

   When He called Israel His son, it is in connection with this coming
   out. "Out of Egypt have I called My Son." And you and I must be fetched
   out from the world and all its associations--and truly severed from
   it--if we are ever to come to know the Lord our God. In Egypt, God was
   not known, but "in Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel."
   His people must not permanently reside in a strange country. The land
   of tombs was no fit home for a living people whose God was the living
   God! Therefore it is written, "Out of Egypt have I called My Son" and
   the heathen knew it, for they said, one to another, "Behold, there is a
   people come out of Egypt."

   There were many difficulties in connection with this calling of Israel
   out of Egypt. Perhaps one of the chief obstacles was their own wish to
   stay there, for, strange as it may seem, though it was a house of
   bondage to them, they did not wish to stir from it at first! Their
   spirit was broken by their sore bondage so that they did not receive
   Moses and Aaron as they ought to have done, but they even chided them.
   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, the chief work of God with us is to make us
   willing to go out, willing, by faith, to follow Jesus--willing to count
   the reproach of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt!
   He did make them willing and they went out, at last, right joyfully,
   marching in rank like a trained army! They did not need to be driven,
   but hurried to escape out of the enemy's country.

   Moreover, the Lord made them able to go, as well as willing, for it is
   very beautiful to think that there were no sick people in the whole
   nation of Israel at that time of the going out! We read--"There was not
   one feeble person in all their tribes." What a splendid thing for a
   whole nation to have no weaklings! There was no need to carry any in
   the ambulance--they all went marching forth with steady foot out of the
   dominions of Pharaoh! O child of God, has God given you the will to get
   out of the bondage of the sin and the corruption of this crooked
   generation? He that gives you the will, will give you the power!
   Perhaps you are crying, "Who shall deliver me? To will is present with
   me, but how to perform that which I would, I find not."

   Rest assured that God, the Holy Spirit, who has given you the will,
   will also give you the strength--and you shall come marching out of
   Egypt, having eaten of the Paschal Lamb! The Lord stunned their
   enemies, so that they begged them to be gone and bribed them to make
   haste! With blow upon blow, He smote the Egyptians, till on that
   dreadful night, when shrieks of pain went up from every house in Egypt,
   the Egyptians hastened them to go. "We are all dead

   men," they said, "unless you go!" Even their taskmasters urged them to
   immediate flight. Our God knows how to make even the wicked men of the
   world cast out the Christian--they cannot endure him when once his
   adoption is made known! They grow tired of his melancholy presence;
   tired of his convictions of sin and of that gloomy face which he
   carries about with him, and they say, "Get out, get out, we cannot
   endure you!" They perceive something in him which is foreign to
   themselves and so they thrust him out. Egypt was glad when they
   departed and so the world, itself, seems glad to be rid of the Lord's
   elect when God's time is come to set a difference between Israel and
   Egypt!

   The spiritual meaning of all this is that from under the power of sin
   of Satan and of the world, God will certainly call His own redeemed.
   They shall not abide in the land of Egypt! Sin shall not be pleasant to
   them! They shall not continue under Satan's power, but they shall break
   his yoke from off their neck! The Lord will help them and strengthen
   them, so that they shall clean escape from their former slavery. With a
   high hand and an outstretched arm He brought up Israel out of the land
   of Egypt--and with that same high hand and outstretched arm He will
   save His own elect whom He has loved from before the foundations of the
   world and whom He has purchased with His most precious blood! They,
   too, shall sing as Israel did, "Sing unto the Lord, for He has
   triumphed gloriously," in the day when God shall deliver them!

   So far we have spoken of the natural seed.

   II. Now we turn with pleasure to THE DIVINE SEED, the Man Christ Jesus.
   He had to be called out by an angel from the sheltering Egypt into
   which Joseph and His mother had fled with Him. I dare say when you have
   read that passage in Hosea, you have said, "I cannot see that it has
   anything to do with Christ." The passage in Hosea is evidently about
   Israel, for God is speaking of Israel both before and after the verse.
   But look--the natural seed of Israel is the shell of the egg of which
   the Divine Seed is the life! God calls Israel His Son. Why? Because
   within that nation lay that Seed which, afterwards, was known as the
   Well-Beloved, the Son of the Highest. They were the shell and,
   therefore, to be preserved for the sake of the Blessed One who,
   according to the flesh, lay within the race!

   I do not think the Lord would have cared about the Jews more than any
   other nation if it had not been that in due time He was to be born of
   them, even He in whom is His delight, that choice One of the Father,
   the Son whom He loves. So when He brought His Son out of Egypt, it
   means, first, that He rescued the external, nominal, outward sonship.
   But the core, the living core within, is this Son, this true Son of
   whom the Lord said, putting all others aside, "This is My beloved Son
   in whom I am well pleased." And the passage, if I had time to show you,
   could not be limited to Israel, for if it had been, it would lose much
   of its accuracy.

   Why, do you think, the passage was made so obscure? It is confessedly
   obscure and anyone reading it without the spiritual teaching which
   Matthew received would never have perceived that Christ was going down
   into Egypt to fulfill that Word. I take it the reason of the obscurity
   was this--that its fulfillment might be of the Lord, alone. Suppose His
   father and mother had known these prophecies and had purposely set
   themselves to fulfill them? There would have existed a kind of
   collusion which would have beclouded the wonderful wisdom of God in
   bearing testimony to His Son. Mary and Joseph may have known of this
   prophecy, but I greatly question whether they perceived that it
   referred to their son, at all, or to the Son of the Highest--but now
   they must do the very thing that God says shall be done--without
   knowing that they are fulfilling Scripture!

   One of the worst things you and I can ever attempt, is to try and
   fulfill a prophecy. Good mistress Rebecca wanted to fulfill a prophecy
   and what a mess she made of it! She endeavored to make her second son
   the heir and, in the attempt, she brought upon him and herself a world
   of sorrow! Had she not better have let the prophecy alone? Surely, if a
   prophecy is made of God, God will see that it comes to pass. If it is a
   Chaldaic prophecy, a prophecy of soothsayers and magi, no doubt they
   will try to make their own oracle true--but the Lord, who sees the end
   from the beginning and ordains all things--can speak positively of the
   future. If any of you set up for prophets, beware of prophesying till
   you know that you can make it good! God does not need such petty
   provision--He needs no help from us--His word will surely be
   established! Mary and Joseph did not try to fulfill the prophecy, for
   they could not have understood it to mean what it meant. It was
   purposely put in a dark and cloudy form, but still the Lord knew what
   He was doing--"That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord
   by the Prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called My Son."

   Remember one thing, that all the Words of God in the Old Testament and
   the New refer to Christ! And what is more, all the works of God have an
   opened window towards Christ. Yes, I say that in the creation of the
   world the central thought of God was His Son, Jesus, and He made the
   world with a view to His death, Resurrection and glorious

   reign! From every gnat that dances in the summer sunbeam up to the
   great leviathan in the sea, the whole design of the world works toward
   the Seed in whom the earth is blessed! In Providence it is just the
   same--every event, from the fall of a leaf to the rise of a
   monarchy--is linked with the kingdom of Jesus! I have not time to show
   this, but it is so, and if you choose to think it over, you will
   clearly perceive it.

   God set the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the
   children of Israel--and everything that has happened, or ever shall
   happen in the outside world--all has a look towards the Christ and that
   which comes of the Christ! I love to find Jesus everywhere--not by
   twisting the Psalms and other Scriptures to make them speak of Christ
   when they do nothing of the kind, but by seeing Him where He truly is.
   I would not err as Cocceius did, of whom they said his greatest fault
   was that he found Christ everywhere, but I would far rather err in his
   direction than have it said of me, as of another divine of the same
   period, that I found Christ nowhere!

   Would it not be better to see Him where He is not than to miss Him
   where He is? The Pattern of the things on earth is in Heaven--is, in
   fact, in Jesus, the Son of God! He is the Pattern according to which
   the Tabernacle and the Temple were built. Yes, and the Pattern
   according to which this brave world was made--and worlds which are yet
   to be revealed. All the treasures of the wisdom of God are hidden in
   Christ--and in Christ they are made manifest. I do not wonder,
   therefore, that this passage in Hosea should point to Him! It is
   certain that our blessed Lord is, in the highest sense, the Son of God.
   "Out of Egypt have I called My Son,"

   Write the word, SON, in capitals--and it must mean Him--it cannot, with
   emphasis, mean anyone else! I would rather give up the idea that Hosea
   even thought of Israel, than think that the Holy Spirit did not intend
   that we should see Jesus in those memorable words, "My Son." It came to
   pass that our Lord must find no room in Israel and so must go down into
   Egypt. There was no room for the young Child in the inn and, now, the
   Edomite, the child-devouring Herod, has risen and there is no room for
   the new-born King anywhere in Palestine! Alas, how sad a picture of the
   visible Church where Christ, at times, can find no room!

   What with contending sects, Pharisees and Sadducees, there would seem
   to be no more room for Christ in the Church, today, than there used to
   be. By fear of Herod, His parents are made anxious, and by angelic
   direction they must go down into Egypt, where Herod's warrant would not
   run. Heathen Egypt will shield, while hypocritical Judea will slay!
   Jesus, like another Joseph, must be carried down into Egypt, that the
   young Child's life may be preserved. Here He has a foretaste of His
   life trials and early begins His life of affliction. The King of the
   Jews flees from His own dominions! The Lord of All must know the heart
   of a stranger in the land of Egypt! The poet represents His mother as
   saying--

   "Through the desert wild and dreary,

   Following tracts explored by few,

   Sad at heart, and worn, and weary,

   We, our toilsome march, pursue.

   Israel's homes lie far behind us,

   Yet we pause not to look back,

   Lest the keen pursuer find us,

   Lest grim murder scent our track.

   Eagles o'er our heads are whirling,

   Each careering towards her nest;

   Even the wolf and fox are stealing

   To the covert of their rest.

   Every fowl and noxious creature

   Finds on earth its lair and bed

   But the infant Lord of Nature

   Has not where to lay His head.

   Yes, my Babe, sweet sleep enfolds You

   On Your fainting mother's arm;

   God in His great love beholds You,

   Angels guard Your rest from harm.

   Earth and Hell in vain beset You,

   Kings against Your life conspire!

   But our God can ne'er forget You,

   Nor His arm that shields You, tire."

   Mark well, that if the Lord Jesus Christ had willed it, even though but
   a Babe, He might have blasted Herod as He did another Herod in later
   days. And He might have made him to be eaten of worms. The glorious
   Jehovah could have sent a legion of angels and have driven the Idumaean
   dynasty from off the throne, if so it had pleased Him. But no violence
   was used--a gentler course was chosen. When Jesus stands up to fight,
   He wars by nonresistance. He says, "My Kingdom is not of this world,
   else would My servants fight." He conquers by flight rather than by
   fight. He taught His people, when persecuted in one city, to flee to
   another. And He never bid them form bands and battle with their
   persecutors. That is not according to Christ's Law or example! A
   fighting church is the devil's church, but a bearing and enduring
   Church--that is Christ's Church.

   His parents fled with Him by night and took Him down into Egypt, that
   He might be sheltered there. Traditions tell us wonderful stories about
   what happened when Jesus went into Egypt, but as none of them are
   Inspired, I need not waste your time with them. The only one that might
   look like fact is that His parents sheltered themselves in a temple
   wherein idol gods were and when the Child entered, all the images fell
   down. Certainly, if not actually true, it is a poetical description of
   that which happens wherever the Holy Child puts in an appearance! Every
   idol god falls before Him! Down he must go, whether it is Dagon, or
   Baal, or Ashtaroth, or whatever the god may be called! Yes, and he that
   wears the triple tiara on the seven hills and calls himself the vicar
   of God on earth--he, too, must come down--and all his empire must sink
   like a millstone in the flood!

   We do not know how the young Child and Joseph and Mary lived in Egypt
   except that they had received gold from the Magi and that, being a
   carpenter, not a hedge carpenter, but one skilled in joinery and
   repairing wheels, Joseph could find plenty of work in Egypt where vast
   multitudes of Jews were already settled. Whether our Lord was carried
   to Alexandria or not, we cannot tell. The probability is that He was
   housed there, for it was the great rendezvous of the nation and the
   center of their learning--there the Bible had been translated into the
   Greek tongue--and there flourished schools of Jews much more liberal
   than those in Judea. It is, therefore, not unlikely that the Prince of
   Peace went to that region where we have most unhappily illustrated
   Christianity with cuts--not all of wood, nor all innocent of blood.

   But Jesus could not stay in Egypt. "Out of Egypt have I called My Son."
   His parents, by a brave act of faith, went back at the command of the
   angel, to the Holy Land--Your land, O Immanuel! Jesus could not stay in
   Egypt, for He was no Egyptian! He did not come to exercise a ministry
   among the Egyptians. He was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel in His public working. Being called out of Egypt, the heavenly
   vision was not disobeyed. His foster-parent, Joseph, took Him back and
   they settled in Nazareth. Yet remember, He had been in Egypt and this
   was a prophecy of blessing to that land--for wherever Jesus goes, the
   air is sweetened!

   Every plot of land that His foot has ever trod on shall be His forever.
   What said God to Jacob? "The land whereon you lie will I give you." And
   the same is true to Jacob's great descendant! Jesus has slept in Egypt
   and Egypt is His own. God has given it to Him and His it shall be!
   Glory be to His blessed name!

   III. Let us turn to think of THE CHOSEN SEED that shall be brought out
   of Egypt. Here I would remark that this passage may be taken and should
   be taken, literally. God has a chosen people who shall assuredly come
   out of the very Egypt which now exists. It is remarkable that early in
   the Gospel day the Truth of God was gladly received in Egypt. Egypt
   became the land of saints and divines and, as it had once been the
   source and home of civilization, so it became an active camp for the
   soldiers of the Cross. Under the successors of Mohammed, all this was
   swept away and now the Crescent's baneful beam falls where once the
   heavenly sun shed out its infinite Glory and scattered health among the
   sons of men.

   Egypt did turn to God and it will turn again. Let me read you this
   passage (Isaiah 19)--"In that day shall five cities in the land of
   Egypt speak the language of Canaan and swear to the Lord of Hosts; one
   shall be called the city of destruction. In that day shall there be an
   altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at the
   border thereof to the Lord. And it shall be for a sign and for a
   witness unto the Lord of Hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry
   unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and He shall send them a
   Savior, and a great one, and He shall deliver them. And the Lord shall
   be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day,
   and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yes, they shall vow a vow unto the
   Lord and perform it. And the Lord shall smite Egypt: He shall smite and
   heal it: and they shall return even to the Lord, and He shall be
   entreated of them, and shall heal them. In that day shall there be a
   highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into
   Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyp-

   tians shall serve with the Assyrians. In that day shall Israel be the
   third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the
   land: whom the Lord of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My
   people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance."

   So that we feel clear that our God has yet a son to call out of Egypt
   and He will call him. There shall be a seed to serve Him even in the
   midst of the down-trod people who live by the Nile floods, for God has
   said it. There is one passage to which I should like to refer you,
   because it is so full of comfort. (Jeremiah 43:12)--"And He shall array
   Himself with the land of Egypt"--think of that--putting it on as Joseph
   put on his coat of many colors! "As a shepherd puts on his garment; and
   He shall go forth from thence in peace." Yet shall Christ wear, as a
   robe of honor, this land of Egypt! And again shall it be true, "Out of
   Egypt have I called My son" Let us learn from this, that out of the
   strangest and oddest places God will call His son. Certain Brethren
   among us go the lodging houses in Mint Street, Kent Street and other
   places. Can any good thing come out of them? Assuredly, it can, for,
   "Out of Egypt have I called My son."

   Out of Thieves' Acre and Ketch's Warren, saints shall come! Some of
   you, perhaps, know of holes and corners in London where a decent person
   scarcely dares to be seen--do not pass by these abominable haunts, for
   out of such Egypts will the Lord call His sons! The worst field is
   often the most hopeful. Here is virgin soil, unplowed, untilled. What
   harvests may be won by willing workers! Oh you brave hands, thrust in
   the plowshare and break up this neglected soil, for thus says the Lord,
   "Out of Egypt have I called My son." Many of you who live in the midst
   of Israel and hear the Gospel every day remain disobedient--but some
   from the lowest and vilest parts of the earth shall yet be called with
   an effectual calling-- and they shall obey, for it is written--"Out of
   Egypt have I called My Son."

   But we will take the text and conclude with it in a spiritual sense.
   All men are in Egypt, spiritually, but God calls out His own sons. Sin
   is like Pharaoh, a tyrant that will not yield. He will not let men go,
   but he shall let them go, for God says, "Out of Egypt have I called My
   Son." We are in a world which is the destroyer of Grace as Pharaoh was
   the destroyer of Israel's little ones. You do not think a good thought
   but what it is laughed out of you! You scarcely catch a word of
   Scripture, but as soon as you get home you are compelled to forget it.
   Nevertheless, out of that-- "Out of Egypt have I called My Son." You
   shall yet be delivered! Put you your trust in Jesus Christ, for, "to as
   many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God."
   And He will call every son of His out of Egypt.

   Perhaps you are in the dark, as the Egyptians were during the plague,
   or as when God turned the dark side of the pillar to Egypt. Ah, but if
   you are one of His--if you will but trust Jesus, which is the mark of
   being God's elect--out of darkness will God call you! Out of thick
   Egyptian night will He fetch you and your eyes shall be made glad with
   the light of the Gospel of Christ! Perhaps you dwell in the midst of
   superstition, for the Egyptians were horribly given to
   superstition--but yet out of that will God call His people! I look to
   see priests converted! I hope to see leaders of the Gospel found among
   men that were once steeped to the throat in superstition! Why not? "Out
   of Egypt have I called My Son."

   Where did Luther come from but from the monastery? And he preached the
   Word of God with thunder and lightning from Heaven--and God blessed it
   to the emancipation of nations! He will bring others of that kind--out
   of all sorts of ignorance and superstition He will fetch them to the
   praise of the Glory of His Grace! I feel encouraged to pray for those
   who appear to be hopeless! I feel as if I must cry to God, "Bring them
   out of Egypt, Lord, the worst, the vilest." You, here, that know what
   Egypt is and are in it, and know you are in it, oh, believe that the
   Emancipator has come! The Redeemer has appeared! With an offering of
   blood He has stood before God and given Egypt for a ransom, Ethiopia
   and Seba for you! Oh, that He might win those with power whom He has
   bought with price! And to Him be Glory, world without end. Amen.

Despair Denounced and Grace Glorified

   (No. 1676)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 27, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then He said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of
   Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we
   are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus
   says the Lord God, Behold, O My people, I will open your graves, and
   cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
   Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your
   graves, O My people, and brought you up out of your graves." Ezekiel
   37:11,12,13.

   I HAVE read to you the vision of the resurrection of the dry bones.
   Keep it in your minds, that you may understand the text. The figure is
   a very apt, instructive and impressive one. It is not, however, a mere
   figure--it is a parable based upon a remarkable representation of the
   resurrection of the dead. Although the children of Israel, at that
   time, knew little enough concerning the resurrection, yet the Lord, the
   Holy Spirit, knew all about it and He used it as a striking picture of
   the salvation of Israel from that national death which had come upon
   them. We may, with equal accuracy, see in it, a vivid representation of
   the work of Grace upon the hearts of all those who are quickened into
   spiritual life by the power of Divine Grace. Men, by nature, are dead
   in sin till they hear the voice of God and feel the quickening breath
   of the Spirit--and are made to live according to that Word of God--"He
   that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
   whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die."

   Such a metaphor as this before us, drops with teaching as a honeycomb
   with honey, and it will be our own fault if we are not taught by it!
   The salvation of men by the Grace and power of God is as great a wonder
   as the general resurrection. The putting of spiritual life into a
   natural man is a marvel of marvels and should excite as much wonder as
   the raising of Lazarus, or of Jairus' daughter, or of the young man at
   the gates of Nain. Even the rising up of the dead at the last trumpet
   is not a greater prodigy than the bringing of dead hearts unto the life
   of God! I shall not, however, detain you by fuller observations upon
   spiritual resurrection, for I have work to do of another kind upon
   which we will spend the bulk of our time and the whole of our energies.

   If you thoughtfully consider the text, you will see that it divides
   itself thus--first, there is a true word--"Behold, they say, our bones
   are dried." Secondly, there is, in it, an evil word which goes beyond
   the Truth of God--"Our hope is lost." God is the sinner's hope and He
   is not lost, so that the word of despair is not warranted. Thirdly,
   there is a gracious word, a word of mighty love--"Thus says the Lord
   God, Behold, O My people, I will open your graves, and cause you to
   come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And
   you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O My
   people, and brought you up out of your graves."

   I. Let us begin with that solemn confession which I have styled A TRUE
   WORD--"They say, our bones are dried." It matters not how badly men
   speak of themselves, for what they say of themselves is never worse
   than the truth. I have never heard of any sinner who, too much,
   depreciated his own righteousness! It is not possible to repent too
   much, nor to have too lowly an estimate of one's deserving or of one's
   spiritual power. It is a grievous fault when mourners depreciate the
   power and fullness of God's Grace and when despondency casts a doubt
   upon the possibility of their salvation. But while the depreciation is
   confined to themselves, it is not possible to push it too far, or to
   exaggerate the evils of an unre-generate condition.

   The sinner's natural estate is as deplorable as words can describe. He
   is, in fact, much worse than he thinks he is, even when he is most
   bowed down under a sense of his guilt and danger. I believe that Luther
   was quite right when he said that if a man could see his own sin as it
   really is, he would lose his reason. The condition into which we have
   fallen by our

   transgressions is terrible to the last degree. Observe, first, that
   they describe themselves as dead, as dried and as divided. They speak
   of themselves as dead--a man does not imagine his bones to be scattered
   about on the plain while he thinks himself to be alive! These people
   spoke of their bones and, therefore, were conceived they were dead. And
   so the sinner may, without exaggeration, conceive of himself as devoid
   of spiritual life. He knows not the life of God, for he is dead in
   trespasses and sins.

   The Apostle speaks of the unregenerate as "alienated from the life of
   God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of
   their heart." And again we read, "They are corrupt, they have done
   abominable works, there is none that does good." When men are corrupt,
   they have gone a stage beyond death and are receiving the full harvest
   of sin. As it is written, "He that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh
   reap corruption." Alas, Sinner, you are as one that is dead, only your
   condition is far worse, for your responsibility and your guilt remain
   and your death to righteousness is blameworthy and will bring
   punishment upon you!

   They were divided, too. These Israelites were scattered abroad in every
   place and, perhaps you, dear Friend, feel that, as Hosea says, your
   heart is divided and you are found wanting. You cannot get your
   thoughts together; you cannot concentrate your affections; you are "as
   when one cuts and cleaves wood upon the earth"--a broken, shivered
   thing! You cannot rally your mind to confidence in God. Your mind is
   dead to that which is good and your heart is divided by a thousand
   delusive devices.

   Perhaps you go further with the figure and seem to be dried, sapless,
   useless, hopeless. A bone is dried when every particle of marrow is
   gone out of it; when it looks as if it never could have been covered
   with flesh, or have been part of a living body. Are you lamenting
   because you seem to be devoid of spiritual hunger, desire, or regret?
   Do you mourn that you cannot feel, cannot will, cannot repent, cannot
   love, cannot even fear? Do you groan because you cannot find in
   yourself anything which is good or looks that way? Do you ever groan
   out that mournful song--

   "Your saints are comforted, I know,

   And love Your house of prayer!

   I sometimes go where others go,

   But find no comfort there.

   I hear, but seem to hear in vain,

   Insensible as steel!

   If anything is felt, 'tis only pain

   To find I cannot feel.

   My best desires are faint and few,

   I gladly would strive for more!

   But, when I cry, 'My strength renew,'

   Seem weaker than before."

   Truly, you are as a dried bone that has long been bleaching in the
   sun--out of which all trace of life and feeling and power has departed!

   This is a very sad description of a man's soul and yet, how many of us
   have had to subscribe to it for ourselves? It is just what we felt
   ourselves to be while we were without God and without hope! And yet,
   the Spirit of God was convicting us of our guilt. Further, these bones
   could, by no means, raise themselves. We never heard of such a thing as
   a dead man restoring himself to life, though he is but newly buried, if
   he is, indeed, dead--he cannot lift a hand towards his own reviving.
   These bones were without trace of life. The flesh was gone, devoured by
   kites and jackals, or rotted and scattered in impalpable powder to the
   four winds of Heaven. How could these carcasses raise themselves? There
   was no trace of moisture left upon them! They could not give themselves
   life or motion--it were a fool's hope to look for such a thing!

   Is that the dreary fact which forces itself upon you? Do not try to
   forget it. You are discovering the truth! You are already in a lost
   condition if you have not believed in Jesus Christ. You are not, as
   some vainly say, in a state of probation--your probation is over and
   you are already condemned because you have not believed on the Son of
   God! In you there is no spiritual power to stir towards God until His
   Spirit moves towards you. You will remain cast out in the open valley
   unless God's Grace shall come to you and unless His Spirit shall put
   breath into you. For you to be saved will be as much out of the common
   course of Nature as any other miracle--and in it you will have no
   finger so as to be able to

   boast--for the Lord, alone, must save you, or you are lost forever! It
   is a terrible word for a man to say, but it is the truth, and nothing
   more than the truth, that he is ruined by sin and "without strength" to
   repair the damage.

   There seemed to be, before these bones, no prospect but the fire. When
   they that cleansed the valley came along and found these bones, they
   would gather them up as offensive objects and cast them into the fire
   of Tophet to be consumed. This is the only lot that remains unto dry
   bones and the same awaits those who are spiritually like they are. Has
   the Holy Spirit been dealing with any of you till you feel as if there
   were nothing for you but a certain judgment and fiery indignation? Do
   you begin to feel, in your own conscience, the first burning of the
   fire which never shall be quenched? Ah, whatever may be your gloomy
   apprehensions, they are none too gloomy!

   It is a fearful thing to have sinned! It is an awful thing to be called
   to judgment! And it is a more terrible thing, still, to be under that
   judgment, now, and only to be waiting until that sentence shall be
   carried out, "Depart, you cursed, into everlasting fire." Oh, if you
   cannot sleep at night and if all enjoyment of earthly comforts seems to
   be taken away from you. If you begin to sting yourself and make your
   own life wretched, I shall not wonder at it! It is amazing that a man
   can live and be quiet, and yet be under the wrath of God! It is a
   strange thing that he can walk this earth with a smile upon his face
   while yet his sin is unforgiven and the sword of the Lord is furbished
   to work his destruction! Oh, that the sinner knew the jeopardy under
   which he lives and the frail barrier that divides him from eternal
   misery! Does he not know that if his breathing should cease, he is gone
   to the place where hope is a stranger? I say, if a man mourns and sighs
   over his terrible future so that a dreadful sound is in his ears, he
   only frets reasonably and his fears are based on solemn truth!

   Moreover, these people felt that they were cut off from healing
   agencies. They say, "We are cut off for our parts." That is, each bone
   is cut off from its fellow and the whole thing is cut off as to its
   parts from every hope and comfort. These banished Israelites were cut
   off from the land of Canaan; cut off from the Temple; cut off from the
   priesthood; cut off from the sacrifices--cut off from all hope of
   approaching God. Many poor souls have been made to feel as if they,
   too, were cut off. Their Sabbaths are no rest to them; the House of
   Prayer brings no delight; the preaching of the Gospel yields no
   consolation. They turn to their Bibles and every page seems to flash a
   threat, while no gentle shower of mercy drops from above! They fall on
   their knees, but even prayer seems to be a hollow mockery! They cannot
   pray as they would. They associate with godly friends, but they gain
   nothing by their fellowship. Go where they may, they think themselves
   like a dry bone which meets its fellow dry bone and is none the nearer
   to eternal life for such dreary communion. The man is a nuisance to
   himself and his very existence is a weariness.

   Ah, you think, perhaps, I am describing an extreme case, but I know
   that I am picturing some whose eyes are looking upon me at this moment!
   Happy they who have been delivered from this wretched state! I had
   almost said, happy they who are experiencing it, for those who feel
   their sinfulness are on the road to better things! Brothers and
   Sisters, I hope your extremity will be God's opportunity. When your
   bones are dried, then will God come in as the Resurrection and the Life
   and make these dry bones live! When you appear to be beyond the
   possibility of mercy, then God, with whom all things are possible, will
   deal with you in a way of extraordinary Grace and cause you to rejoice
   in His salvation!

   It seemed to these poor people as if they were quite given over, for
   when bones are cast out in the field and left to be bleached by the
   wind and the sun; when nobody gives them burial, but there they lie,
   the refuse of the charnel house, then they are, according to all
   likelihood, left for destruction. I have heard of persons who have felt
   in their spirit as if they were forever banished from the Light of God.
   They have cried, "Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger
   shut up His tender mercies? Is the Throne of Grace closed against the
   mourner? Will nothing avail? Will not cries and tears bring an answer?"

   By such downcast ones a whisper has been heard inwardly saying, "There
   is no mercy for you--you are cast out as reprobate silver." It is the
   whisper of Satan in the spirit and it comes with piercing power! The
   devil often uses the conscience to be the hack on which he rides in his
   errands of torment. Yet there is a measure of truth in the insinuation.
   Apart from Christ, we are cast off! Apart from Christ, God cannot look
   upon us except in anger! Apart from the atoning blood, our sins protest
   against the entrance of mercy and there we lie--self-condemned and
   helpless--abandoned in our own judgment to swift and sure condemnation!
   Here, then, is language full of misery and yet sadly true. We are sold
   under sin by nature and led captive by the devil--driven by our
   iniquities to endless misery from which ignorance and wickedness will
   not permit us to escape.

   II. I now turn to that point upon which I desire to struggle with some
   of you this morning, that you may be fetched up by the Spirit's power
   from the depths of despondency. Here is AN EVIL WORD in the text--"Our
   hope is lost." It is a good thing if our false hopes are lost, but true
   hope is still to be had. Hope is not denied to any man--if he will
   believe in Jesus, he may yet be saved. They said of old in the Latin,
   Dum spiro spero, while I breathe, I hope. And I turn the proverb over
   and say, Dum spero spiro--while I hope, I breathe! To render the
   sentences rather freely will suit me well--"While I live, I hope, and
   while I hope, I live."

   Sinner, your life lies in hope and while you have hope, you have life!
   To despair is an unwarrantable thing--a thing full of sin and fraught
   with mischief--besides being false and unreasonable. Despair, which is
   the mind's declaration that there is no hope, is not so much a sickness
   of the understanding as a sin of the soul. It is a crime against the
   Truth of God; a high offense against the Lord of Love. God is, "the God
   of Hope," and those who are without hope are also without God! No
   mortal has a just pretense to perish in despair and if he does so,
   despair is a form of suicide, a form of willful self-destruction. No
   man has a right to despair! No man can be right while he is despairing.

   Let me just speak about this and keep to the point. Despair is a high
   insult to God. It casts dishonor upon His chief attributes. In the
   first place, it is most derogatory to the Truth of God. If a man says,
   "I cannot be saved," he contradicts the Divine command, "Look unto Me,
   and be you saved." God has sent the Gospel to men and it is no other
   than good news to them, but despair virtually says it is no Gospel, it
   is no good news! God has set up a Throne of Grace and promises to meet
   there with the sinner, but this man claims that there is no Throne of
   Grace, for he denies that there can be any Grace for him. He refuses to
   come to the loving Father because he feels sure that He will show no
   mercy, though He has declared that He will do so!

   God has given a thousand precious promises, such as this--"Though your
   sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are
   red like crimson, they shall be as wool." The despairing sinner says he
   does not believe this--his sin is too scarlet to be made white--the
   crimson of his guilt is too ingrained ever to be washed away. Thus he
   calls God's promises, lies, and this is a daring thing to do. "He that
   believes not God has made Him a liar because he believes not the record
   that God gave of His Son." It would be an exceedingly heinous offense
   for me to stand up and say to the Great Physician, "You say, 'I can
   heal you,' but it is an empty boast--my wound is incurable! Great God,
   you say, 'I can forgive you,' but it is lie--my sins are such as You
   can never pass by."

   Mark, Brothers and Sisters, the Lord our God is very jealous of His
   truthfulness. His name is, "God That Cannot Lie," and he that dares to
   say that He will break His promise has done Him sore despite. I need
   not, surely, show the infamy of this crime! Let your own hearts condemn
   the treasonable thought! He that despairs, insults God's power. He
   does, in effect, tell the Lord that He pretends to a power which He
   does not possess. God says, "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved"--the man says he will not trust in Christ, for he does not
   believe that God can save him! He declares that he has gone beyond the
   bounds of mercy and so he tells the ever Gracious One that He has no
   power to save him. The Lord loves not that His Omnipotence should be
   thus denied. He is grieved with those who thus limit the Holy One of
   Israel. They that would restrain His power shut out one of the
   brightest beams of His Glory.

   And despair abundantly casts dishonor upon God's mercy. Know you not
   that His mercy endures forever? "The Lord God merciful and gracious" is
   one of the ways of His manifestation. Has He not told us that He
   "delights in mercy"? Yet, if you say, "He will not have mercy upon me,
   I have out-sinned His Grace. I have gone beyond all possibility of
   forgiveness," you do, as much as lies in your power, spit in the face
   of the God of Love! Have you ever thought of this? Grieve to think that
   you have ever grieved Him in this fashion! This is the cruelest of
   sins--it aims its dagger at the heart of the Lord--it pierces the
   Redeemer's hands and feet! The Lord glories in His power to save and He
   has plainly declared that He will save all those who confess their sins
   and put their trust in Him--and do we doubt Him? Dare we so derogate
   from the Glory of the Most High as to say that there remains no hope of
   Grace for us? Shame on such insulting falsehood!

   Mark you, while it does this, which is bad enough, despair brings out
   the devil and crowns him in Christ's stead! Despair says to Satan, "You
   are victorious over the mercy of God! You have conquered Christ
   Himself." Christ says that He is revealed that He may destroy the works
   of the devil and you stand up and say, "Here are certain of the devil's
   works which Jesus cannot destroy, namely, my sin and my sinful
   inclinations." You wave the flag of the devil in the face of an
   insulted Savior and, whereas He is able to save to the uttermost them
   that come unto God by Him, you, in fact, tell Him

   that He has not half the power to save that Satan has to destroy--that
   Satan can be more successful in destruction than Christ can be
   effectual in saving!

   What? Have you, again, chosen Barabbas and given up Jesus? And is
   Barabbas, in this case, the fiend of Hell? Will you believe him and not
   believe God? Can you assert that he, the father of lies, is more worthy
   of belief than the Christ who died that men might live? Yet despair
   says as much as this and says it in the most offensive manner! It
   prefers Beelzebub to Jesus, for it believes the lie of Hell and rejects
   the Word of God from Heaven! I go a little further and I say, with a
   deep feeling of solemnity, that this heinous sin of despair tramples on
   the blood of Christ. Christ has died and shed His blood--and we know
   that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. We have God's
   Word for it, yet here is a man who says, "It cannot cleanse me from my
   sin."

   If we look deep into the essence of actions, we shall see that despair
   despises the Atonement and denies its efficacy. We tell the man that
   there is forgiveness, but he mutters, "It is not for me." We tell him
   that Jesus Christ has emptied His veins to fill a sin-cleansing
   fountain and he answers, "It may be true. He may be able to save all
   others, but not me." Now, what you have a right to say, other people
   may also say. And if all united with you, it would be tantamount to
   declaring that the Crucifixion is an empty show; that the Redeemer's
   Atonement is a mere pretense and that Christ is powerless to save! You
   reduce the Savior to an impotent pretender--and can this be done with
   impunity? We preach in vain if this is so! We preach a Savior who
   cannot save, an Atonement which cannot cleanse! Will not God deal with
   you for this, if you persist in this provocation?

   Perhaps you think it is very humble of you to talk so, but it is
   not--it is the height of arrogant impudence! Despair is highly
   insulting to the dear Redeemer, the Glory of whose Person is involved
   in His power to forgive. Remember, Judas who despaired was damned,
   while the men who crucified Christ were led by Peter's sermon to
   believe and live. Great sinners who believe shall find mercy, but far
   less offenders who despair shall find misery. God save you, then, from
   the Judas sin of despairing and enable you to believe in Jesus Christ
   at once! I must go a step further. Despair has something in it of
   sinning against the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit brings you rich
   cordials in the promises of God which will raise your spirits and will
   restore you from death.

   And what do you do with them? You take them and dash them against the
   wall, as if this almighty medicine, devised by Infinite Wisdom, were
   the deceitful nostrum of a quack and you could not receive it! It seems
   to me a great and horrible offense to deny the testimony of the Spirit
   of God, even of Him who gives to the Holy Scriptures inspiration and
   cer-tainty--and this you do when you refuse to believe for eternal
   life! Jesus has put it before you, Himself, "Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out." How can you think that He will cast you out?
   The Prophet cries, "Ho, everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters,
   and he that has no money, come buy wine and milk without money and
   without price." But Despair answers, "There is no wine and no milk for
   me," and it denies that Grace is to be had without price.

   In the teeth of Scripture, it declares that there is no pardon, no
   mercy, no salvation--thus it denies the witness of the Spirit of God!
   Oh, take heed, despairing one, lest it be said to you, "You have not
   given the lie unto men, but unto God." It is a master sin, this sin of
   despair! God save you from it if you are in danger of falling into it,
   or if you are already its prisoner! When a man gives way to despair,
   there comes upon him, usually, a habit of wrangling against God and His
   Truth. Oh, see him at it! He is very low and he comes to see the
   minister. And the minister's compassionate soul would comfort him in a
   moment if it were possible and, therefore, he begins to talk to him
   about the Gospel.

   "But," says the other, and he introduces a tough question which throws
   the Gospel out of sight. "Oh," says the minister, "but God hears
   prayer." "No, no," says the man, and he begins quarrelling about prayer
   and its disagreement with Divine decrees and so forth. The man snarls
   like a dog, not to keep his bone, but as if he begged to have good food
   taken away from him. He does not want it. His soul abhors all manner of
   meat. The minister sets before him a precious promise which he thinks
   will certainly meet his case, but the perverse mind strives against it
   and fights with the promise as if it were his worst enemy! It is not a
   promise that suits his case at all--there is a word in it which he does
   not understand-- and off he goes on a tangent, beclouding the Word of
   God and eclipsing its light--so that he may, if possible, keep himself
   from being comforted!

   If God's people come and try to cheer him with their experience, he
   fights against their experience tooth and nail! It may be theirs, but
   it never can be his--there is something particular and peculiar about
   them--why they should have mercy. And there is something equally
   particular and special about him as to why he should not have mercy. He
   has the

   key of the door of hope, locks it on the inside and then murmurs, "I am
   shut up and cannot come forth." Whereas he fastens the door, himself!
   Sometimes the despairing one gets into such a nasty, ugly temper
   against everything that comes to him from the Bible and from the
   ministers of God, that you begin to think that he must be half mad. So,
   perhaps, he is, but it is not a madness that saves him from
   responsibility--it is a madness which will be laid to his charge in the
   great day of account because it is self-inflicted and willfully
   persisted in! Oh, what a wrangling, contentious spirit will despair
   breed, so contrary to receiving the kingdom of Heaven as a little
   child!

   Worse than this, despair makes a man ready for any sin, for there are
   many that say, "I can never go to Heaven, therefore I will take a good
   swing, here, and get what pleasure I can while it is within reach."
   Have I not heard them say, if not in words, yet in their
   actions--"There is no mercy for me and I may as well be hanged for a
   sheep as for a lamb. I will go the whole hog, now I am at it! I will,
   at least, know the heights and depths of sin, as there is no chance of
   mercy for me"? Ah, and when Satan takes a man in another temper, he
   tells him that God will never forgive him--and the poor creature sits
   down in sullen rebellion, murmurs, thinks hard things of God, wishes he
   had never been born--and curses the day in which it was said that a man
   child had seen the light! Then he will be filled with blasphemous
   thoughts and it may even come to pass that he rushes into
   self-destruction and takes a leap into sure perdition! How many have
   been driven by despair to the knife and to the halter, or to a watery
   grave, I cannot tell! But this I know, that if Satan can once fill a
   man's mind with that, and make him say that God is not true, that the
   Gospel is not true, or at least not true to him, then the enemy glories
   and cries, "I have him, body and soul! I can do anything with him,
   now."

   It was said of the Russian soldiers that they would not go to battle
   till they were drunk with raki and, certainly, some men are champions
   for the devil when they are drugged by despair of pardon. Captain
   Past-Hope is a fierce leader of bandits and will do and dare the
   blackest crimes. With all my might I cry to you--above all things shun
   despair, never say your hope is lost! There is salvation for you yet!
   God has not cast you away! Oh, do not cast away yourself! What are you
   doing? The Lord has not given you over to the tormentors, but you are
   writing your own sentence! You sit down and seem to think that you
   cannot be happy till you are thoroughly unhappy and cannot be at rest
   till you are driven from all peace!

   I must still plead with you over this matter. Let me say, further,
   despair degrades a man, degrades him below the brute beast, for brutes
   do not despair. See how an insect will struggle, even when it is cut in
   halve! Look at a poor bird-- what hope it has, even in its worst state,
   of yet escaping the fowler's net--still it flutters and does its best
   to get away. Will you despair where ants and wasps and birds still
   hope? Have you never seen a dog that had done something wrong and has
   been beaten by its master? He tries to lick the hand that has beaten
   him and he cannot be happy till he is forgiven! Poor creature, how it
   looks up for a smile! You have been chastened, you are smarting under
   it now, but you do not turn to God, nor seek His favor! You think worse
   of God than your dog thinks of you! Instead of crouching to His feet,
   as your poor dog does to you, to try and get a gracious word, you growl
   at the great Lord--"It is of no use for me to be humble: there is no
   hope." You slander the Almighty! You malign the name of Jesus Christ!
   You deny the power of the Spirit of God and so you degrade yourself
   below the beast that perishes!

   Oh this despair--avoid it, I pray you, as you would avoid death,
   itself, for it will render all means of Grace useless to you! If you
   will not believe, neither shall you be established. If you fall into
   despair, the songs of Zion will be dolorous ditties in your ears and
   the preaching of the Gospel might as well be the preaching of the Law.
   See how a despairing man shuts his ears, like the deaf adder that will
   not hear, charm you ever so wisely! It matters not what the theme may
   be--if it is infinite mercy, free forgiveness, or everlasting love--yet
   as long as the soul is despairing, you do but make it the more
   wretched. The hopeless hearer rejects all consolation, his soul refuses
   to be comforted and his despair embitters every morsel he eats and
   every drop he drinks.

   Despair, too, is certainly vain and wicked because it has no Scripture,
   whatever, to support it. "Oh," you say, "but there are many dark
   Scriptures." I know there are, but I have not time, this morning, to
   take them up, one by one, and show that they need not lead any man to
   despair. But there is one text in the Bible which covers all texts, be
   they black as they may. I do not mind what the passages of Scripture
   are, nor what they testify--I am sure they speak the Truth of God and,
   therefore, I know they cannot speak contrary to other parts of Divine
   Revelation. Here is the famous text--"Him that comes to Me, I will in
   no wise cast out." If you come to Christ, you cannot be cast out! "Oh,
   but there is a text!" I do

   not care about your text--you misunderstand your text! But there is no
   misunderstanding this one--"Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise
   east out."

   "Oh, but He will cast me out because_." Stop now! Are you going to
   contradict my Lord Jesus Christ? I cannot

   have patience with you. You will greatly provoke the Father. "I will in
   no wise cast out"--that means for no sort of reason, under no
   circumstances, under no possible conditions will Christ ever cast out a
   man that comes to Him! "Oh, but do listen to me." No, I shall not
   listen to you and I wish you would not listen to yourself! You must
   listen to me as I repeat the Lord's words--"Him that comes to Me, I
   will in no wise cast out." You are not to be listened to when you want
   to make out God to be false. Oh intolerable sin! Jesus says He will not
   cast you out. Again He cries--"Come unto Me, all you that labor and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Does Christ mean that, or not?
   Look the Crucified One in the face--look at His wounds--and after
   having looked at them, say, "I do not believe Him. Christ lies to me!"

   Will you dare say it? Can you thus defame Him? I tell you, there is
   nothing within the covers of this Book that ought to lead a man to have
   any doubt about the infinite mercy of God to him, provided he will just
   come and trust himself with Christ. There is no God at all if a soul
   that trusts in Jesus can be cast away, for the essential of Godhead is
   Truth. I am an atheist if the God in whom I have believed casts away
   those that trust in His Son, Jesus! He must be true, if every man is
   proven a liar! What do you say, then, to that blessed Word of God, "Him
   that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out"? Now, listen, you
   desponding one on the border of desperation! Have you never heard of
   the freeness of God's mercy? Do you not know that everything that He
   bestows on sinners is given freely and graciously? The ground of God's
   love is God's love and nothing in us.

   When He made His eternal choice, there was a remnant according to the
   election of Grace. It is Free Grace that chooses for its love and then
   loves for its choice. When Christ redeemed us, He did it freely--He
   freely delivered Himself up for us all. When He pardons sins, He is
   "exalted on high to give repentance," and there is nothing freer than a
   gift-- "to give repentance and remission of sins." I tell you, the very
   spirit of the Gospel is this, that there is no worthiness nor desert
   needed in you in order to your immediate forgiveness and acceptance
   with God! All you have to do is to admit to the truth that you have
   sinned and deprived yourself of all claim upon God--and then believe
   what God declares to you--that He is in Christ Jesus reconciling the
   world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. Do but
   accept this word of reconciliation and you are a saved man as sure as
   you live! The moment you believe that Jesus is the Christ, the moment
   you trust your soul wholly and entirely in those dear hands that were
   pierced for you, you are a saved man!

   What right have you to doubt that God can save you when everything is
   prepared and given of free Grace? I tell you the Lord Jesus has saved
   many others like you. Are you a harlot? Did He not save the harlot,
   Rahab? Are you exceedingly wicked? You are not worse than Manasseh, who
   is said to have cut Isaiah in halves with a saw and filled the streets
   of Jerusalem with blood--and yet the Lord saved him! I know that even
   though you are the worst that has ever lived, still, you cannot outrun
   my Master's wing-footed Grace! Paul said he was the chief of sinners,
   but he obtained mercy to be a pattern to you. Why talk, then, of
   sullenly lying down in despair? You sigh--ah, if you mind not what you
   are doing, what you say in your despair will come true through your own
   making it so! If a man says, "I shall die, I shall die of starvation,"
   and there is a dish before him, but he will not eat, I am afraid that
   the probabilities are that he will die of starva-tion--and it will
   serve him right.

   If another person cries, "I shall die of thirst," and there is a cup of
   drink before him and he will not put it to his mouth, I fear that he
   will die of thirst--and, (I come to where I was before)--he will die a
   suicide. He that refuses to eat and, therefore, dies, is as much a
   suicide as if he stabbed himself in the heart. And he that will not
   believe God's mercy and will not accept it in Christ, is a soul-suicide
   as surely as if he plunged into debauchery and gave himself up to every
   lust. Oh that God the Holy Spirit would overcome some of you, this
   morning, who have yielded to this great and grievous sin!

   III. We shall now close by meditating upon the Lord's promise which we
   have styled A GRACIOUS WORD. I want you to notice this, poor troubled
   hearts--I want you to suck in this part of the text even if you forget
   all the rest. "Thus says the Lord God, Behold, O My people, I will open
   your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves." Notice, God
   meets us upon our own ground and takes us up where we are. They said,
   "We are as dried bones." "Yes," says God, "and I will quicken you." But
   the Lord even goes beyond anything which they have felt or said, for
   they did not say they

   were buried. No, they were as bones scattered in the open valley,
   unburied--but the Lord knows they are worse than they think they
   are--and so He goes further in mercy than they thought they had gone in
   misery!

   He says, "I will open your graves," and that looks as if they were
   finally laid in the sepulcher. But the Lord adds, "and cause you to
   come up out of your graves." Listen, Sinner, you have described
   yourself in a very distressing manner, but God accepts it as true and
   deals with you as being such as you describe, or even worse! He regards
   men not only as dead, but as entombed--in as hopeless a case as corpses
   pent up in the sepulcher and forgotten as dead men out of mind! O the
   mercy of the Lord! There is no boundary to it!

   Now, observe how the Word brings comfort by introducing another actor
   upon the scene. You are like a dried bone, good for nothing, and able
   for nothing. But the Lord comes in, Himself, and He says, "I will, I
   will." Oh, that grand, "I will!" "I will open your graves, and cause
   you to come up out of your graves." "I will." Now, listen. If God will
   save you, cannot you be saved? If it is all of Grace from top to
   bottom, cannot you be saved? If there is no merit needed of you; no
   previous goodness to qualify you--cannot salvation come to you? If
   Christ died for the ungodly, cannot you have a share in His death? If
   He came into the world to save sinners, then why not you? If the Gospel
   is not another shape of Law requiring something of us, but if it is all
   free, free, free Sovereign Grace--why should not you have it as well as
   I?

   What should shut you out? If anything could have shut you out it could
   have shut me out, for I am just the same as you are by nature, yet I
   have obtained mercy, and why should not you? Come along and have it! It
   is freely given to all who seek it, trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ.
   But remember that God comforts us here by depicting the completeness of
   His working. He does not merely say, "I will open your graves." That is
   something, but if they are dead, what is the good of opening the
   graves?

   I have known careless ones drop into this place on a Sabbath as dead in
   sin as dead could be and buried, too--you never would have thought that
   they would listen to the Gospel! But there has crept into their ears
   some such sweet Word of God as this--"He that believes in Him is not
   condemned," and they have said, "Dear me, how sweet it is! How precious
   that is." Glory be to God, the grave has begun to open! But they felt
   they could not get hold of the Savior for themselves--and then the Lord
   has opened their hand and closed it on the promise--and when they get
   it, they will never give it up, but they have cried, "He loves me! He
   loves me! I will risk my salvation on it--I will trust Him! I will
   trust no one else." Thus the Holy Spirit has fetched them out of the
   grave though they were dry bones before! He will do the same with you.
   Oh that you may have Grace to believe what God says here!

   Lastly, notice the feeling which is produced by it. "And you shall know
   that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and
   brought you up out of your graves." Ah, what a feeling a man has that
   there is a God when God has saved him! When he begins to dance for very
   joy of heart because he is fully forgiven, then he knows Jehovah is
   God! When his heart feels restful and full of peace; when he can say,
   "God is mine, Christ is mine, Heaven is mine," he does not need
   evidences of the existence of God, or arguments to prove the power of
   God! He carries a demonstration of the Truth of God within his own
   heart and tells of it to others with tearful eyes. "Oh," he says,
   "there is no mistake about it! There is a merciful God, for I have
   obtained mercy! There is a refuge for sinners, for I have fled to it!
   There is pardon, for I have obtained it! There is rest, for I enjoy it!
   There is a Heaven, for I begin to hear its bells ringing in my

   heart."

   Then shall you know that God Jehovah is God, indeed, when He has opened
   your graves and brought you out! O God, bless this poor word to the
   troubled ones, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

A Great Mistake and the Way to Rectify It

   (No. 1677)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 3, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of
   nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor,
   and blind, and naked: I counsel you to buy of Me gold tried in the
   fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed,
   and that the shame of your nakedness does not appear; and anoint your
   eyes with eye salve, that you may see." Revelation 3:17,18.

   THESE words were spoken, not to the outside world, but to the Church of
   Laodicea. They relate to persons who were in a Church state, who had
   been baptized on confession of their faith in Christ and who were
   thought to be in a fine spiritual condition. They had a singularly high
   opinion of themselves and probably considered that of all the seven
   Churches in Asia, they were the first in power and influence. The words
   before us are as sharp as they are true--and they demand the earnest
   attention of all professors of our holy faith--for to persons like
   ourselves they were addressed and, moreover, we have the special note
   of attention--"He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says
   unto the Churches." Here the axe is laid to the root, not of the oaks
   of the forest or the pines of the mountainside, but to the root of the
   trees of the vineyard and the choice trees of the garden of the Lord.
   By this, the Lord showed His love to the true ones in Laodicea,
   according as He says, "As many as I love I rebuke and chasten."

   While reading the text, I feel forced to cry, "O my threshing, and the
   corn of my floor!" Truly the flail must first be used upon the heap
   that is gathered in the garner. It is all in vain to preach to the
   outside world unless matters are true and right within. The Kingdom
   cannot come, nor the Lord's banner be lifted high if the soldiers of
   His own army prove false and turn back in the day of battle. The time
   is come when judgment must begin at the house of God! The word to the
   slaughter men in Ezekiel was, "Begin at My sanctuary." The stout heart
   of the king of Assyria will not be punished till the Lord has performed
   His whole work upon Mount Zion and on Jerusalem!

   Behold, the Lord Himself comes to deal with His Church, for His fire is
   Zion, and His furnace is in Jerusalem. "His fan is in His hand, and He
   will thoroughly purge His floor." As for them that are outside, God
   will judge them in His own time, but now, by His blessed Spirit, He
   speaks to those of us who are within the Church and make profession of
   His name. The solemn words which make up our text were also spoken by
   the Lord Jesus under a most special title--"These things says the Amen,
   the faithful and true Witness" (Rev. 3:14), as much as to say that
   though the Laodicean professors were false, mistaken and deluded, He
   who now addressed them by His servant John was true and faithful. He is
   the Amen, the Verily, Verily of God! He judges not according to the
   outward appearance, but looks at the heart according to truth.

   He is "the faithful and true Witness," who does not flatter, nor keep
   back any of the terrible Truths of God, but speaks out that which He
   perceives with His eyes of fire and warns men of their condition with
   all sincerity. Instead of crying peace, peace, where there is no peace,
   and letting them be like Moab at ease from their youth and settled upon
   their lees because not emptied from vessel to vessel, He stirs them up
   that the sediment of their falsehood may be seen and their evil case be
   made manifest. Oh for Grace to hear this Word at this time as from the
   Lord Jesus and as from Him under the weighty Character of a Witness,
   faithful and true, speaking as the Amen of God!

   It seems to me that my text accounts for the lukewarmness of the
   Laodiceans. They were lukewarm because they imagined themselves rich
   when they were poor. Two conditions will help us to escape
   lukewarmness. The one is to be really rich in Grace, for they that have
   much Grace will not be lukewarm. Grace is as a fire in the soul and he
   that has much of it, so as to become an advanced Christian, cannot but
   have a heart boiling with earnestness. The other way is to have but
   little Grace, but to be painfully aware of it--to be deeply conscious
   of soul-poverty--to sigh and cry because you are not what you should
   be.

   There is no lukewarmness in a strong desire caused by a bitter sense of
   need. The poor man, poor in spirit, conscious of his imperfections and
   failures, is never a lukewarm man, for with sighs and cries coming out
   of a heart that is all on fire with a desire to escape out of such a
   sad condition, he besieges the Throne of God that he may obtain more
   Grace. These Laodicean people, however, were unhappily in such a state
   that you could not get at them. They were not so poor that they knew
   they were poor and, therefore, when the poverty-stricken were
   addressed, they said, "These things are not for us: we are increased in
   goods." They were blind, but they thought they saw; they were naked and
   yet they prided themselves in their princely apparel and, therefore, it
   was hard to reach them.

   Had they been outwardly worse--had they openly sinned, had they defiled
   their garments with overt transgression--then the Spirit might have
   pointed out the blot and convicted them, then and there. But what was
   to be done when the mischief was hidden and internal? Had they been
   utterly cold and frost-bitten, then He might have thawed them into
   living warmth. But such was their puffed-up notion of themselves that
   one could not convince them of sin, or awaken them to any sense of
   fear--and it seemed likely that, after all, the Lord must necessarily
   spue them out of His mouth as things He could not endure. How far this
   may be true of any one of us may God, in His infinite mercy, help us to
   judge, each one, for himself. Whether it is true or not, it will not
   matter as to the usefulness of the discourse if God the Holy Spirit
   will bless it to our souls in His own way.

   Two things in the text call for our notice. The first is their
   saying--"You say, I am rich." and the second is Christ's counsel--"I
   counsel you to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich;
   and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your
   nakedness does not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that
   you may see."

   I. First, let us think of the Church in Laodicea and listen to THEIR
   SAYING. It may prevent us from reaching such a height of pride as to
   speak as they did. The spirit of self-congratulation expressed itself
   in a manner strikingly unanimous. If all the members did not say so in
   words, yet, as a whole, they were so self-contented that the great Amen
   spoke of them as one person, "Because you say, I am rich, and increased
   with goods, and have need of nothing." Doubtless a few wept and sighed
   before God, but they were so few in number that they did not mar the
   apparent unanimity of the Church in its conscious self-respect, nor
   divide the united utterance of its open boasting. "You say, I am rich,
   and increased with goods."

   It would seem that their minister was of the same opinion. Good, easy
   man, he felt that his Church was in a splendid state, for the Spirit of
   God, here, speaks to the "angel of the church," who is, no doubt, the
   minister of the Church and He says to him, "You say, I am rich, and
   increased with goods." The self-complacent man had probably gathered
   together a wealthy congregation--wealthy as compared with the general
   run of the people of God--who were usually the poorest of the poor.
   Among these were persons of considerable talent and, as a body, they
   were intellectual and educated. They were so rich in all sorts of
   endowments that they had "need of nothing." Perhaps they hardly needed
   a minister at all, but were able to become, every man, his own teacher
   and so the timid man was quiet and smooth-tongued for fear they should
   dispense with him.

   They might, perhaps, prefer an open meeting, and then what would become
   of him? The proverb says, "Like priest, like people," and under the
   preacher's lukewarm addresses, the Church became lukewarm, too. They
   were so rich in gifts that they did not need to economize and send out
   their Brothers to preach, one by one. They could afford to let a dozen
   attempt to do what one could have done a great deal better. They had
   grown to be such a leading Church that other Churches looked up to
   them. They were noted and celebrated all over the country. A member of
   the Church of Laodicea was recognized, at once, as a remarkable person,
   so that wherever he went, the people would ask him to get up and
   speak--for coming down from Laodicea, that famous Church which had
   "need of nothing"--surely he could not open his mouth without precious
   things dropping from them, for was he not one of those who were "rich
   and increased with goods, and had need of nothing"?

   It was a first-class Church and their prudent and kind minister thought
   so, too, and he often took occasion to say as much. When he spoke to
   the good people of Philadelphia, at their anniversary meeting, he told
   them that he hoped they would do their best, although they had but a
   little strength and could not expect to equal his people who were so
   much richer and so much better educated. Of course, all Churches could
   not be so strong as Laodicea--it was not likely that everywhere, in
   those little places, they could gather congregations such as he was
   proud to look on every Sabbath in the Tabernacle at Laodicea! It was
   the general unanimous feeling, from the minister down to the latest
   convert, that they

   were a most wonderful Church. They were heartily at one in having a
   high estimate of themselves and this helped to keep them together and
   stirred them to attempt great things.

   This saying of theirs was exceedingly boastful, for it divides itself
   into three parts. They were "rich"--that was their present state. They
   were "increased with goods"--that is, they could look back upon years
   of great prosperity and progress in their past history. And at that
   present time, if they were not absolutely perfect, they were getting
   close to the edge of it, for they had "need of nothing." They did not
   know of anything which the Church lacked. They had the best deacons,
   the best elders, the best members--they were always ready to do
   anything and everything that was proposed to them. They were rich and
   increased with goods, and had need of nothing. The present was all
   right, the past was eminently satisfactory and they had reached a point
   of all but absolute perfection--for they needed nothing!

   And when people have need of nothing they can go no further--they have
   ascended to the highest point--their sun has reached its zenith; their
   path has been like the path of the just which shines more and more unto
   the perfect day! Truly I do not know that they could have opened their
   mouths any wider! They gave forth about as fine a piece of brag as one
   is likely to meet with in any ancient record. Here is a Church which is
   a city set on a hill that cannot be hidden! Is it not a candle that
   gives light unto all that are in the house? And the candle needs no
   snuffing--it is burning at its very best. Think of a Church which has
   need of nothing!

   Now, notice once more, that they were sincere in this glorying. When
   they said it, they were not consciously boasting, for the text says,
   "And you know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
   blind, and naked." They did not know the truth! They were not
   hypocrites--when they thus spoke with such self-conscious complacency
   they really thought it was so--and their minister thought so, too. The
   angel of the Church thought that it was an angelic Church! There was no
   insincerity in what they said. In fact, I dare say they said to
   themselves, "We really speak below what we might say. We are a
   wonderful. What we do could hardly be put in print or people!
   Thoroughly described in words, our existence is an extraordinary fact."
   They did not know the real truth of the matter, but they sincerely
   believed the flattering tale which their ignorance told them. How
   readily do we believe a lie when it fosters in us a high opinion of
   ourselves!

   But now see what was their actual state--they were altogether mistaken.
   Their mistake was founded upon ignorance--"You know not." These
   intelligent persons, these wealthy persons, these instructed persons
   did not know themselves and that is the grossest kind of ignorance. A
   man may know all about Africa and the sources of the Nile and the
   Congo, and yet he may not know what is going on in certain regions of
   the home department. He is ignorant, indeed, who does not know his own
   condition in reference to the most weighty matters. In our Church there
   are many members who know shamefully little about it--they go in and
   out among us and they have not enough concern about the Church to make
   its spiritual state a matter of enquiry. I grieve to say that there are
   members who, I fear, do not know their own spiritual state and who take
   it for granted that everything is sound! They say, "No doubt it is all
   correct."

   If their conscience is touched and they are troubled, they call it
   unbelief--though it is quite another thing and may be praised as godly
   fear. If they are driven into a corner by conviction, they say, "I must
   not get into this state. I must hope for the best." They make the best
   of everything and shut their eyes to all storm signals. These Laodicean
   people were mistaken through ignorance--they had not searched--they had
   judged the surface of the matter and never looked below the topsoil.
   But, "the faithful and true Witness" makes them see the naked truth. He
   says, "You know not that you are wretched." That is to say, they were
   in a sad and undesirable state. There was nothing about them that could
   please God and nothing about them that would have pleased themselves if
   they had seen things in a true light. "You are wretched." Oh, what a
   change from the distorting glass of self-flattery to the clear mirror
   of truth! How these men that had need of nothing are shown up when
   Christ begins to describe them! They seem to need everything!

   The next word, "miserable," conveys the same idea to us in the English,
   but the original had better, perhaps, been translated, "pitiable."
   There was nothing about them to admire, but everything to pity, for
   everything that seemed to be good was really false. Everything that was
   apparently useful was a mere matter of display. As Jesus Christ looked
   at Laodicea, He said of the Church, "Pitiable! Pitiable!" He does not
   use fine expressions, does He, towards this respectable Church, this
   Church with so much wealth and so much strength? He does not flatter
   it, for He says of it, first, "Wretched!" and then, "Pitiable!" Then He
   goes on to say, "Poor!" Poor in the choice things in which they thought
   they were rich; so much Grace they thought they had, but He says they
   have exceedingly little and calls them "poor." Oh,

   but they had such riches of faith! "No," He says, "poor!" Oh, but they
   had such abundance of energy. "No," He says, "that is only a pretense.
   They are poor."

   He searches the members through and looks into their hearts, where
   their precious things are stored up, and He says of them all, "Poor."
   There is a sense in which the Lord cries, "Blessed are you poor," but
   these were poor in quite another sense. Think of it! Here are a people
   that were "rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing," and
   yet the verdict of the Savior is, "They are poor!" And then He goes on
   to say they are "blind." Blind? Why, they had among them men of the
   greatest possible discernment, who could see as far into a millstone as
   any people! They were able to split hairs over points of doctrine and
   they had discernment of spirits, so they thought, and could tell who
   was and who was not sincere! But Jesus Christ says they have no
   discernment, they are "blind."

   They are not merely shortsighted and weak about the eyes, but
   altogether blind. And, mark you, this is no exaggeration--it is not a
   hard speech meant to sting them into repentance, but the, "Amen, the
   faithful and true Witness," says this calmly and deliberately--and says
   it about that admirable Church of Laodicea concerning which we heard so
   much when we commenced our discourse--they were poor and blind! And now
   He adds that they were "naked." No, surely, not that! Will the Savior
   say as much us that? Yes, He says so. They are not dressed in the
   righteousness of Christ--they are dressed in their own cobwebs of
   conceit--and, therefore, they are naked. They are not resting upon
   Christ, but relying upon their own strength and wealth and, therefore,
   He says they are "naked."

   Yes, these same people, who "have need of nothing," yet have need of a
   rag with which to cover the shame of their nakedness! They are "naked"
   before God. Had a storm suddenly come upon them, they would have found
   it out. We are such poor creatures that we need to be covered from the
   sun and from the wind, from the wet and from the drought, from the cold
   and from the heat. Such is our weakness that we have need of garments
   against all outward surroundings--and so it was with these
   Laodiceans--not only for the common decency of their appearance did
   they need to be robed in the righteousness of Christ, but they needed
   the most ordinary kind of covering. Though they did not know it, they
   were open to have been scattered and destroyed as a Church had anything
   happened out of the ordinary.

   Oh, this mistake! May the Lord of Truth prevent us from making it about
   ourselves, individually, and prevent every Church from making such a
   mistake about itself and being unanimous in it! These professors were
   poor and proud; they were conceited and, therefore, they were not
   likely to be converted. They thought they were making progress, but
   they were going backward and because they did not know their true
   condition, it was hard work to help them. You remember the Tay Bridge
   disaster? There is no doubt, whatever, that the bridge was not fitted
   for its position, its ordinary strain was all it could bear--but nobody
   thought so. Undoubtedly the engineers reckoned it would stand any test
   to which it might be put and, therefore, there was no attention given
   to it to make it any stronger and to provide against sudden disaster.
   And, consequently, when a specially fierce hurricane was out one night,
   it swept it all away!

   That is just the picture of many a Church and many a man because he is
   thought to be so pious, and the Church is thought to be so correct and
   vigorous, therefore no attempt is made for improvement, no special
   prayer, no cries to Heaven, no repentance because of backsliding--and
   so when there comes an unusual pressure, a night of terrible
   temptation--the whole fabric falls in ruins! How much better is the
   condition of the man who feels that he is weak and, therefore, goes to
   the strong for strength! I know a railway bridge at this moment which
   is showing signs of danger--there are cracks in the brickwork and other
   mischief--in all probability it would soon have come down if let alone.
   But it has been noticed by the railway people and they are as busy as
   possible trying to repair it and prevent an accident.

   Is not this much better than a delusive belief that all is safe? If
   there is a crack in the substantial part of your religious structure,
   what a mercy to see it! If the supporting pillars begin to give way,
   what a blessing to perceive the fact! "Oh," says one, "you make us feel
   uneasy." Yes, it is often a great blessing to be uneasy and that
   blessing, I pray the Holy Spirit will confer upon you! It is infinitely
   better to be uneasy and to get right, than to be perfectly serene and
   all the while to be wrong! How many a house is built upon sand and only
   waits till the floods shall come and the winds shall beat upon it--and
   then the whole fair fabric will vanish like a vision of the night! Will
   it not be well to let the tenant know his peril? I think so.

   Now I leave this saying--may we never use it, ourselves. We have looked
   underneath the surface and we have seen the mud which lies at the
   bottom of what seemed a glassy pool.

   II. Now we come to think of OUR LORD'S BLESSED COUNSEL. "I counsel you
   to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white
   raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness
   does not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may
   see." I call your attention, first, to the amazing Grace which is here
   displayed. Ask a schoolmaster what kind of pupil is most objectionable
   and I think he will reply that he cannot bear a youth who knows so
   much, already, that he will learn nothing correctly. It is very
   difficult to deal with the conceited. We can instruct persons who are
   conscious of ignorance and willing to learn, but those who "have need
   of nothing," what can you teach them? They are up to the mark in all
   points; they are models--they can teach you and, therefore, what can
   you say to them?

   But here our blessed Lord seems to single out this puffed-up Church,
   though pride is always obnoxious to Him, and He draws near to it and
   begins to speak to it in love. He does not use a peremptory tone, but
   in words of great affection He tenders His advice. He does not say, "I
   command you," but, "I counsel you." It is tantamount to that other
   blessed text, "Come now, and let us reason together." He puts it so
   softly, as if He said, "I offer a little kindly advice to you-- will
   you listen to Me? I might speak in harsher tones. I might condemn, I
   might command, but instead of that I stoop to you and counsel you. See
   whether My counsel is not good. Am I not the Wonderful, the Counselor?
   Is not the wisdom of God in Me? Therefore I am come to speak to you,"
   says Christ, "and counsel you."

   Note how He begins--"I counsel you to buy." Is not that singular
   advice, indeed? Just now He said that they were "wretched" and "poor."
   How can they buy? Surely it suggests to us, at once, those blessed free
   Grace terms which are only to be met with in the market of Divine
   Love--"Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."
   The chapmen of Vanity Fair have great difficulty to bring people up to
   their price, but the Lord Jesus Christ's difficulty is to bring people
   down to His--and so He begins by counseling the poor to come and buy on
   such terms as this-- "Without money and without price."

   But why is it called buying? If you have nothing to give, why does He
   not say, "Come and take it"? No, it is buying because God would have us
   make business of it. If any of you have backslidden and yet dream that
   you have not declined; if there creeps over you the cold thought that
   perhaps it is so; then awaken yourselves and make a business of
   recovery! Come to Christ and buy! Not merely act the beggar's part, but
   come and act the purchaser's part, with thoughtfulness, with desire,
   with judgment! Come, now, and give an estimate--do as you would if you
   were buying a valued article. Estimate the value of Christ and see how
   richly He is worth having! In a purchase there is consent on both
   sides--the one consents to sell and the other to receive by
   purchase--therefore the word, "buy," is used, for God does not force
   the gifts of His Grace upon any man, but He first teaches him his need
   of those gifts, and then He bids him come and buy, though it is without
   price, by exercising thought, making an estimate, having a strong
   desire, being willing to give anything if he had anything to give--and
   then taking the blessing with joyful willingness. Christ gives them
   counsel to buy.

   But next, what does He say? "I counsel you to buy of Me." Ah, they had
   been dealing with one another! They had been chaffering and bartering
   amongst themselves! One Brother had brought this talent and another,
   that, and they had grown rich, as they thought, by a mutual commerce.
   "Now," says Christ, "compare yourselves with yourselves no longer! Give
   up seeking of man and buy of Me." It is the very foundation of
   Grace--to be willing to buy of Christ. Have you a religion which you
   received of me? It is not worth a pin! Have you in possession a
   religion which you received of your mother, your father, your Sunday
   school teacher? Your neighbors, your friends? It is worth nothing! All
   true Grace must be bought of Christ on free Grace terms--"I counsel you
   to buy of Me."

   Do you not know that Jesus is a great monopolist? Nobody else has
   anything to sell of this kind. The articles He speaks of are entire
   monopolies in His hands! No one else can sell you the gold tried by
   fire, or white raiment that you may be clothed, or eye salve that you
   may see! The whole stock of Grace is vested in the Person and offices
   of Jesus Christ and, therefore, He says, "I counsel you to buy of Me."
   Do you wear a spiritual vesture which you bought elsewhere? Do you use
   an eye salve which you purchased of another physician? Do you hoard up
   gold which you procured of some pretended goldsmith? Throw the
   imaginary gifts away, for there is no genuine article in the market
   except that which comes of the Lord Jesus Christ and of Him, alone! "I
   counsel you to buy of Me."

   Oh, that every Christian here would lay hold upon this advice and say,
   "I will go and buy of Christ again." Have I been living on past
   experience? Have I been living on a profession which I have maintained
   these last 20 years? I will do so no longer--I will buy of Jesus
   anew--I will get my manna fresh from Heaven! I will seek all my
   provisions, day by day,

   from the Person of my blessed Lord and Master, for He counsels me to
   buy of Him! Now see the goods which He describes. "I counsel you to buy
   of Me"--what? Everything! It is true that only three needs of these
   people are here mentioned, but they are inclusive of all needs.

   First, the Lord says, "Buy gold." The man who can buy gold has bought
   everything, for money answers all things. He who has gold, has the
   medium with which he can procure whatever he needs. In Christ there is
   a fullness of all good things and in the gold of His Grace there is an
   adaptation to every need. You cannot have a necessity, nor even think
   of a necessity which is a real one, but the Grace of God, which is like
   fine gold, will be sure to meet it! Your free will, your unaided
   efforts, your wisdom, your knowledge, your strength--all this you can
   get something for in such-and-such a market--but in God's market there
   is nothing current but this precious gold and, if you get the gold of
   Grace, then you can get whatever your soul needs. "I counsel you," says
   He "to buy of Me gold."

   Then, next, He brings forth raiment rich and rare--perfect coverings
   such as do really clothe a man so that the shame of his nakedness will
   never appear. I like that expression. It is very plain, but what
   suggestions there are in it! Our sin is our shame and it is well that
   the Lord has found a complete covering for it. Sin brought nakedness
   upon us and shame is the result. But He who has Christ has lost both
   sin and shame, for the blood of Jesus removes guilt from the soul and
   terror from the conscience! Man was naked and is still naked apart from
   Christ, but in Christ he is covered and has become comely before the
   Lord. Even those eyes of God which see everything cannot see that which
   does not exist--and God has said of His people's iniquities--"They
   shall not be."

   God has cast the sins of His people behind His back and, therefore, He
   cannot see them! "If they are searched for, they shall not be found;
   yes, they shall not be, says the Lord." And if they shall not "be" or
   exist, then are they gone from His sight! What a covering this must be!
   What a purchase this is for a man to buy white raiment of Christ!
   Imputed and inherent righteousness make up the double garment of
   righteousness, worked out for us by the Lord Jesus and in us by the
   Holy Spirit. This is a fair garment in which to stand among men and it
   will fit us to appear at the Judgment Seat of God. Jesus says, "I
   counsel you, buy this of Me." No one else has this sacred apparel to
   dispose of. The fig leaves of earth are a mockery and the cobwebs of
   conceit are soon blown aside, but the covering which adorns and
   comforts is with Christ, alone, whose name is, "The Lord Our
   Righteousness."

   Next, our Lord recommends them to buy an eye salve of Him. That is a
   very curious recommendation, is it not? For they were blind--and can an
   eye salve give blind men, eyes? Many salves are useful for eyes when
   they are weak or inflamed, but what salve is of any good to a blind
   man? He says they are blind and yet recommends them to buy eye salve of
   Him. Strange counsel! But there is no setting forth Gospel principles
   by human similes without endowing the emblems with something above
   Nature. We must strain that which is human to set forth by it that
   which is Divine. O you that have no heavenly discernment; that have no
   eyes upon which the Light of God might fall, Christ Jesus counsels you
   to come and buy of Him the true eye salve--that ancient salve of high
   renown, or something more marvelous, still--which will open your eyes
   so that you shall see that which is invisible and shall behold the face
   of God!

   This is glorious! No other physician has such eye salve! None else can
   even pretend to! The Savior has the whole stock of this sovereign
   remedy! He is the sole dispenser of it--no one can make the like--go,
   then, to Him who sells, and buy for yourselves! The counsel of the Lord
   is not only that we buy of Him everything, but that we buy the best of
   everything of Him. Laodicea had made the mistake of buying
   second-quality articles which turned out to be good for nothing. Our
   Lord says, "I counsel you to buy of Me gold." Gold is the most precious
   metal, but He would have them buy the best of it--"gold tried in the
   fire," gold that has just passed through the assay and has the mint
   mark upon it--gold that will endure all further tests, having survived
   that of fire.

   O Brothers and Sisters, our wisdom is to buy what we buy from Christ,
   for from Him comes Grace which will endure to the end! I have lately
   been looking through some of the sufferings of the Waldenses for Christ
   and the sad spectacle has produced a most painful effect upon my mind,
   but, I trust, also a beneficial one. When I read of the horrible
   cruelties worked upon them by the Papists and of the firmness of feeble
   women and children, as well as men, I asked myself, Could I endure such
   torments? I did not dare believe that I could, for they suffered
   agonies which scarcely even the devils of Hell could have invented!
   Suppose that you and I should possess a sort of Grace which would not
   endure such tests--will it be the right sort of Grace? If we are never
   dragged at the heels of horses, or set up as targets, or dismembered,
   or burned at a

   slow fire, yet we ought to have that same kind of Grace which made
   these gracious ones more than conquerors through Jesus Christ!

   It is true we may never have to suffer martyrdom, but a man must be
   prepared to give up house, lands, wife and children, yes, and his own
   life, also, sooner than forsake Christ. Look at the saints in the first
   days, the young, brave Church of Christ, when the world sought to stamp
   out our holy faith. They defied the world and Pliny writes to Trajan to
   know what to do, for the Christians come crowding to the judgment seat
   to avow their faith! Instead of shunning the conflict, they seemed to
   court it, knowing that to avow themselves Christians was speedy death!
   They were yet eager to do it-- knowing that unutterable torments
   awaited them--they offered themselves willingly to bear anything for
   their dear Savior. Do you think we could act in this fashion? Yes, if
   we have bought the true "gold tried in the fire," but not otherwise. Is
   our gold of this sort?

   Do not begin talking about how you could endure martyrdom--how do you
   endure the ordinary trials of life? In those lesser pains that come
   upon your body--are you patient? Those little disquietudes in the
   domestic circle--do you keep your temper over them? Those words that
   sometimes drop carelessly, not meant to be unkind, but which grate on
   your feelings--can you forgive them, for Christ's sake, and think no
   more of them? If not, what kind of gold is this which cannot bear the
   touch of the acid? Such metal would hardly do to lie on the hob, much
   less to be put in the flame, for if it begins to melt in such mild
   heat, it would utterly vanish in the furnace! Oh to have gold which has
   been tested in the center of the flame, such as God Himself will
   acknowledge in the Last Great Day when He shall come to separate
   between the precious and the vile! Christ counsels us to buy the best
   and we can only get it by buying it of Him, "without money and without
   price."

   Remember the raiment, too, for that is of the best. Our Lord calls it
   "white raiment." That is a pure color, a holy color, a royal color. We
   put on the Lord Jesus as our joy, our glory, our righteousness. To walk
   with Him in white is real honor and sure acceptance--it marks us out as
   victors through Him that has loved us. This robe is the true wedding
   dress, a holiday robe and yet a serviceable garment arraying a man from
   head to foot. Are you wearing it? Is your sin hidden? Does it not, at
   times, appear? Does it not come before your own conscience? "Beloved,
   if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God, but if
   our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all
   things." Have you this covering so that you will not be afraid to die
   in it, nor afraid to stand before the blazing Judgment Seat in it? Are
   you sure, certain, positive that your sin is put away in Christ Jesus?
   This is what you need and you must not be content with less! If you
   must play at haphazard, do it with your estates, do it with your lives,
   but never leave your soul-affairs to be a matter of chance! Make sure
   work for eternity!

   A man likes to be quite positive about the title deeds if he buys a
   farm. But what is that? If I wish for Heaven, I need to be sure that I
   have it--sure that I have Christ who is the Glory of it--sure that I am
   pardoned and renewed which is my fitness for it. One single note of
   question upon that matter will banish all peace and joy out of your
   heart. God grant us Grace to buy the white raiment through which
   nothing of sin can be seen, for all guilt is gone. And as to the eye
   salve, it is the best possible one, for Jesus says, "Anoint your eyes
   with eye salve that you may see." Eye salve that can make a blind man
   see stands in the front rank of all the medicine that ever can be sold!
   Oh, for Grace to get it, so that we may see and know spiritual things!

   Can you say, "One thing I know, whereas I was blind, now I see"? Are
   you the pure in heart who see God? Is God about you wherever you are?
   Can you see your own sin and hate it? Can you see the power of Christ's
   blood and delight to be washed in it? Can you see the spiritual
   kingdom, or do you only see the things of your trade and business, the
   things which blind worldlings can perceive? O God, give us real sight
   that we may see Heaven and delight in it, see Hell and flee the sin
   that will bring us there, that we may see Christ and rejoice in Him
   evermore! He counsels us to do this. So I must come to a close by
   noticing that all this is the counsel of Christ and the counsel of
   Christ to a people that were proud and self-conceited. He gave those
   counsel who thought they needed none!

   Does not this reveal infinite Grace, that He should come to such and
   sit down by them and say, "Come now, put your case into My hands. It is
   a very bad one and I advise you to come to Me for help"? Oh, how
   tenderly would I try to speak, this morning, in imitation of the soft
   tones of Jesus! O you who have thought of yourself other than the
   truth, I do not counsel you to despair! At the sight of the truth I do
   not counsel you to say, "I will give it all up; there is no hope."
   "No," Christ says, "be advised; take counsel; I counsel you to come to
   Me, now, and get in very truth all that which you

   only had in fancy. All things are ready for you! You have not to search
   for the gold and dig it up from the mine--here it is--come and buy it."
   "Lord, I have not a penny to buy it with." That does not matter! Buy it
   without money and without price! These are the easy terms of the
   gracious Savior!

   Believe, and be rich! When Satan tells me, or conscience tells me, that
   I am not a Christian, that I am not saved, then I find it wise to say,
   "I will begin now. If I have made a mistake. If I have been
   presumptuous. If I have not truly believed, then I will believe at once
   and lay hold upon Jesus at this good hour!" I recommend you who are not
   puffed up to take Christ's counsel, for when He counsels these proud
   ones to come, I am sure His advice is good for you, too. It is always
   wise to get gold when you can buy it for nothing! I guarantee you if
   the Bank of England put up a notification that they would sell any
   quantity of pure bullion for nothing tomorrow morning, our Stock
   Exchange men, instead of turning into Capel Court, would take the other
   side of the street and dispose, at once, of the Bank's surplus! There
   is a ready market for pure gold at this extraordinary minimum! Come,
   then, and accept the gold of free Grace! It is sure to be useful,
   therefore come along, you that love Christ, and you that are afraid you
   do not love Him. Come along, all of you--come and buy this "gold tried
   in the fire." You will never made a better investment in all your
   lives. May the good Master sweetly lead you to do so.

   But what a rebuke this is to all boasting! The Lord does not say to us,
   "You have been very foolish in talking about your riches," but He
   convicts us by saying, "I counsel you to buy gold." He does not say,
   "You are stupid to glory in your dress," but He convicts us by saying,
   "Buy raiment." He does not condemn us for pretending to be able to see
   when we are blind, but He cries, "Anoint your eyes with eye salve." Is
   not this a sweet way of making us feel our error? Perhaps you would
   turn away from stern rebuke, but you cannot turn from love! Come now,
   members of this Church and members of no Church--come, buy these three
   precious things, "without money and without price!" You cannot take
   better counsel than that of the Son of God! Therefore, do as He bids
   you and buy at once!

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 10, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And upon this came His disciples, and marveled that He talked with the
   woman, yet no man said, What do You seek? or, Why are You talking with
   her? The woman then lefther waterpot, and went her way into the city,
   and said to the men, Come, see a Man which told me all things that ever
   I did: is not this the Christ? Then they went out of the city, and came
   unto Him." John 4:27-30.

   Behold our Lord and Master with divinely skillful art seeking after a
   single soul! We must have large Congregations or we are disinclined for
   soul-winning. The habit of the age is to do nothing but what is
   ostentatious--every work must be with beat of drum or sound of
   tambourine! I pray that the Lord may work in us the steadfast desire to
   do good on the quiet, by stealth, when no one looks on, when not a
   single disciple is near. Oh that we may have such an estimate of the
   value of a single soul that we count whole days well spent to bring one
   fallen woman or one drunk to the Savior's feet! Blessed is he who works
   on though he is never heard of and looks for his reward from his
   Master.

   In the heat of the day the Lord Jesus found rest and refreshment in
   speaking to one whom many would scarcely look upon except with eyes of
   scorn. Blessed Savior, we do not marvel, as the disciples did, that You
   did speak with the woman, but we do wonder with a higher kind of
   astonishment that You ever did speak to the likes of us who have so
   sadly fallen, done You dishonor and grieved Your heart! We are amazed
   that He who is the Glory of Heaven, "Light of light, very God of very
   God," should shroud Himself in the likeness of sinful flesh and, being
   found in fashion as a Man, should seek after us unworthy ones. Oh, the
   compassion of the Redeemer's heart!

   Read this chapter through carefully and see the skill which that
   compassion taught Him. How sweetly ready He was to converse with her
   and take up her questions. Never imagine that the 30 years of
   retirement at Nazareth were wasted. I would gladly go, if I were young,
   for 30 years to learn how to talk as He did, if His own Spirit would
   teach me the lesson. He was a perfect Teacher because as Man, He had
   lent a willing ear to the heavenly instruction of the Holy Spirit and,
   therefore, grew in knowledge and fitness for His work. As says that
   notable Scripture, "The Lord God has given Me the tongue of the
   learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that
   is weary: He wakens Me morning by morning, He wakens My ear to hear as
   the learned. The Lord God has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious,
   neither turned away back."

   By communion with God in private and by watching men in seclusion, He
   learned both the mind of God and the nature of man, so as to know how
   to handle the human mind. Men are "unpredictable cattle," and can only
   be managed by a wise hand. Many an earnest fool has driven a soul to
   Hell in his endeavor to drag it to Heaven by force, for human wills
   yield not to such rough force, but rebel the more. Souls have to be
   brought to salvation by a gentleness and wisdom such us the Savior used
   when He fascinated the Samaritan woman into eternal life and enticed
   her to the truth--so I can only describe that wondrous power which He
   exercised over her in the few short but blessed sentences with which He
   addressed her.

   Now, turn a moment from that Glorious One, that perfect Man and yet
   infinite God, whom we would lovingly adore before we look away from
   Him. Here come His disciples! They have been in the city to buy
   food--an errand most neces-sary--that they and their Teacher might
   live. But look! When they perceive Him talking with a woman, they
   marvel, each in his own way. Some are dumfounded and cannot explain the
   phenomenon! Others look as if they would interpose, if they dared, and
   would cry to the woman, "Away you vixen! What right have you here,
   speaking to such a One as our Leader, whose shoe-laces even we are not
   worthy to unloose? Your approach dishonors Him! Take yourself away."

   They did say so with their eyes, though awe of their Lord restrained
   their tongues, for these disciples of Jesus were steeped in the
   customary antipathies of the age. First, it was sufficiently offensive
   that the person with whom Jesus was conversing was a woman. My beloved
   Sisters, you owe much to the Gospel, for it is only by its agency that
   you are raised to your proper place. For what said the Rabbis? "Rather
   burn the sayings of the Law than teach them to women." And, again, "Let
   no man prolong conversation with a woman. Let no man converse with a
   woman in the streets, not even with his own wife." Women were thought
   to be unfit for profound religious instruction and altogether inferior
   beings. My Sisters, we do not think that you are superior to us, though
   some of you, perhaps, fancy so, but we are right glad to acknowledge
   your equality and to know that in Christ Jesus there is neither male
   nor female! Jesus has lifted you up to your true place, side by side
   with man!

   Even the Apostles were tainted, at first, with that horrible
   superstition which made them marvel that Jesus openly talked with a
   woman. Moreover, they wondered that He could talk with such a woman! I
   do not suppose they knew all about her character, but there is a look
   about the fallen which betrays them--they cannot conceal the boldness
   which a course of vice usually produces. They may have thought, "If He
   had talked with an aged matron, a saintly mother in Israel, it might
   not have been surprising; but how can He converse with such a woman?"
   They did not, as yet, understand His mission to rescue the perishing
   and save the lost. This poor woman, also, had the misfortune to be a
   Samaritan and, above all things, Jews hated Samaritans as aliens and
   heretics who dared to call Jacob their father and to believe themselves
   orthodox!

   Jews and Samaritans were much alike and you know the sects that
   approach nearest to each other usually reserve their most bitter hatred
   for their next of kin. They will tolerate those who are far removed
   from them because they are altogether in the darkness of error and so,
   are somewhat excusable. But those who have so much light, they detest
   for not seeing eye to eye with themselves. We pity a dumb man, for he
   cannot speak at all, but we are indignant that one who can say,
   "Shibboleth," will not take a little more trouble and pronounce it,
   "Shibboleth," as we do! Surely he might go that other inch and be quite
   right. This woman was one of those Samaritan heretics who had dared to
   set up an opposition temple to the one at Jerusalem and say that they,
   also, were the people of God--so the disciples shrank from her and
   marveled that Jesus did not do the same. How could so good a man mix
   Himself up with such people?

   I have, myself, heard a great deal of foolishness spoken about mixing
   up with certain people because we dare to meet with them upon some
   common ground to accomplish a right purpose. I have sometimes wondered
   whether people ever read of Abraham, when he fought for the cause of
   the king of Sodom. A horrible man, I have no doubt, that monarch was,
   yet when his country had been plundered by the invading kings, Abraham
   marched out on behalf of the King of Sodom--not that he cared for
   him--but that he desired to deliver his nephew, Lot. For that reason he
   is found in some measure of association with Sodom's king--but when the
   object upon which they were united was achieved, then see how the
   princely Abraham washes his hands of the man. He says, "I will not take
   from you a thread even to a shoe-lace lest you should say, 'I have made
   Abraham rich.'" Thus there may be a temporary union among men, between
   whom there is the widest difference, and this apparent unity may be
   lawful and expedient because the end to be gained is altogether good.

   Our blessed Lord was seeking the good of this unholy woman and,
   therefore, He was fully justified in talking with her. Thereby He
   rebuked the superstition of His followers more effectually than by
   words. There is another side to the question. How could these disciples
   marvel that He spoke with anybody, after having chosen them and called
   them? Surely, when they frowned on others, they forgot the dunghills
   where they grew! If they had only remembered where they were when He
   found them and how often they had grieved Him by their perverseness,
   they would have reserved their surprise for their own cases. Ah,
   Brothers and Sisters, ever since the Lord spoke with me, I have never
   marveled that He spoke with anybody--it has not crossed my mind to make
   it any subject of wonder that He should stoop to the lowest and
   meanest, now that He has stooped to me!

   Yet I fancy I have seen, in certain Brothers and Sisters, evident signs
   that they forget that they were, themselves, once strangers in Egypt.
   They forget that Grace washed and cleansed them, or else they would
   have been filthy still, for Paul truly says, "such were some of you." I
   am sorry when saved ones affect superfine purity and marvelous
   spirituality--and turn away from such as Jesus would have welcomed.
   Alas, such disciples have little of the tenderness of their Master! Our
   Divine Lord has more tenderness for sinners than the whole of us put
   together! There is more love in His soul towards

   lost ones than there is in all these thousands of Believers here
   present, though I hope that many of your hearts beat high with a loving
   desire that the guilty may be delivered from the wrath to come.

   But look at the disciples! Look, yonder is John, that sweet-souled
   John, and yet he marvels! And there is Peter, good but faulty, and he
   marvels! And there is Thomas, the thoughtful, and he marvels! They are
   all good men and yet they are marveling that Jesus is gracious to a
   poor woman! Oh, Peter, and John, and James and the rest of you, look
   into your own hearts and let a glance of the Holy Spirit lighten up the
   darkness of your spirits--and you will renounce this self-righteous
   marveling which grieves the woman--and you will enter into deeper
   sympathy with your Lord's love. Dear Friends, let us never disdain the
   worst of men or women, but seek, with all our might, to woo and win
   them for our Lord! Oh, to have hearts of mercies as Jesus had! This
   will well become the followers of the compassionate Son of Man.

   Look, as the result of this conduct of the disciples, one of the
   sweetest conferences that was ever held was broken up and brought to a
   close at its very climax. Just when Jesus had said, "I that speak unto
   you am He," then it must end, for here they come, these cold,
   unsympathetic ones! Yet they were disciples, were they not? Oh, yes,
   and true disciples, too! But, alas, no breakers of communion are more
   blamable or more frequent in the offense than Christ's own disciples
   when they are out of sympathy with their Master. You see, they are
   thinking about the meat and about the Savior's need of it--and these
   thoughts were most proper--but not very elevated or spiritual. They
   come, amazed that Jesus speaks with a woman, and so the holy conference
   ends and the woman must go!

   Oh, when any of you draw near to Christ and He is just lifting the
   silver veil from His dear face, and your eyes are beginning to behold
   Him, mind that you keep your door shut! "Oh, but it is a good man at
   the door." Yes, but he will be just as likely to mar your fellowship as
   anybody else! The best of men may sometimes intrude between you and the
   Well-Beloved--and fellowship which seemed as if it must mellow into
   Heaven, itself, will come to a speedy and sorrowful close! I do not
   blame Peter that he wanted tabernacles in which to remain upon the top
   of the mount, for he was pretty well aware of what he might meet upon
   the plain. Do you not often wish that you could sing--

   "Sequestered from the noise and strife, The lust, the pomp, and pride
   of life; For Heaven I will my heart prepare, And have my conversation
   there"? Although the conference was thus broken up, the consequence was
   the Lord's Glory, even as often out of evil He works good. Since the
   woman cannot sit and gaze upon the Divine face of her Lord, nor hear
   the strange music which flowed from His blessed lips, she will give
   herself to holy activity--she goes her way to the city and she speaks
   to the men. This is well--there is little to deplore when men's hearts
   are so right that you cannot take them away from glorifying Christ, do
   what you may! When, if you disturb their private communion, they are
   ready, at once, for public service! Driven away from sitting, like
   Mary, at the Master's feet, let us rise to play the Martha, by
   preparing a table for the Lord! Always reckon, dear Friends, whenever
   you are taken off from your usual course of life, as it were, by a
   jolt, that the Lord has some special work for you to do.

   Do not fret, or try to buck the engine to get on the old lines again.
   No, if the switch is turned by the Divine hand, go on--He that has the
   management of all the railroads of your life knows better which way
   your soul should go than you, yourself, can know! I have observed
   Christian people jerked out of a pious family, where they were
   extremely happy, and placed in the midst of ungodliness--a situation
   not of their own choosing or seeking, but appointed of the Lord--that
   they may bring godliness into that house and shed light in the midst of
   the darkness. Friend, you, too, may be taken away from this Church
   where your soul has flourished, and you may feel like one banished and
   bereaved. Well, never mind! If you are sent to some Church where
   everything is dreary and dead, go there like a firebrand to set them on
   fire!

   Your Lord would not have permitted the breaking up of your peace unless
   He had some high service for you. Since you are His servant, find out
   His will and do it! God will thus honor Himself in you and, by-and-by,
   He will honor and comfort you, also. Observe that the woman, now,
   becomes a messenger for Christ. She has to quit conferring with Him to
   go and testify about Him! She did not go unbidden though, for she
   remembered that the Lord had said at an early period of the
   conversation, "Go, call your husband and come here." So she goes to
   call her husband! It is well to have a warrant for what we do. Observe
   she interprets her orders very liberally. She thought as the Christ had
   said, "You have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your
   husband," He could not have limited her errand to one who was not

   her husband except in name--and so she might as well call any of the
   six men with whom she had dwelt and, therefore, she might speak to all
   the men who were loitering about the public square and tell them what
   she had seen!

   Remember how our Savior gave a large interpretation of His own
   prophetic mission. He was not sent as a Teacher except to the lost
   sheep of the house of Israel, but He went to the very edge of His
   diocese, if He did not go over it. He went to the borders of Tyre and
   Sidon and when a woman came out of those parts, He had healing for her
   daughter! Though He did sow most of His seed upon the acres of the Holy
   Land, yet He made it fly over the boundary. In fact, He sowed all the
   ages and, on this once barbarous island there have fallen blessed
   handfuls which are bringing forth fruit to His Glory! Always go to the
   verge of your commission--never stop short of it. Try to do more good
   than you can and it is very possible that you will be successful.
   Indeed, if you only try to do what you can do, you will do little! But
   when, in faith, you attempt what you cannot, alone, accomplish, God
   will be at your back--and in your weakness His strength shall be made
   clear!

   Notice that the woman leaves her waterpot. The Spirit of God thought
   well to record this circumstance and, therefore, I think there must be
   a measure of teaching in it. She left her waterpot, first, for speed.
   Perhaps you have got it into your head that it was an ordinary English
   waterpot, such as you water the garden with--possibly you so picture
   it, rose and all. Nothing of the sort! It was a big jar, or large
   pitcher of earthenware she had to carry on her head or her shoulder. It
   was quite a load for her and so she left it, that she might run the
   more quickly. She was a wise woman to leave her waterpot when she
   needed to move rapidly. Others think she did so because she was so
   taken up with her errand that she forgot her pitcher. It is blessed
   forgetfulness which comes of absorption in a holy design!

   When the King's business requires haste, it is wise to leave behind
   everything that would hinder. Our Lord Jesus, Himself, forgot His
   hunger in His zeal to guide a soul to peace. And it is said of Him in
   the Psalm, "I forget to eat My bread." He was so absorbed in His
   heavenly work that He said, "I have meat to eat that you know not of."
   A man has hardly felt the power of eternal things, unless, at times, he
   forgets some earthly matters. If a man is called to rush for his life
   through a room full of crockery there will, probably, be a number of
   breakages. You cannot think of everything at once--your mind is limited
   and it is not advisable that you should divide the strength of your
   thoughts by having two or more aims.

   So she left her waterpot. Without thought she hit upon as good an
   action as thought would have suggested. The wa-terpot would have
   hindered her, but it might be useful to the Christ and His disciples.
   Thus they could give Him to drink. He was thirsty and probably so were
   they--and with her pitcher, they could help themselves. Besides, it was
   a pledge that she was coming back. She said, "I am running away on an
   errand, but I shall come back again. I have not listened to the great
   Teacher for the last time. I shall return and hear Him further, till I
   know Him better and trust Him more fully." So it was significant that
   she left her waterpot.

   Sometimes you will have to leave your shop to win a soul. You will cast
   up a row of figures wrongly and wonder why--and the reason will be that
   before your mind there fluttered the soul of a swearer or the figure of
   a drunk, or the image of a fallen woman--and your heart was filled with
   the longing to find the lost sheep. Never mind. I dare say the woman
   had her water pot, again, and you will get back to business, again, and
   rectify your blunder, attend to the shop and set all matters right. And
   if a soul is saved, you will have made a profit by any loss you have
   sustained.

   We have started the woman on her mission. Now I want you to observe
   particularly her mode of address, for there is teaching here. She said
   to the men, "Come, see a Man which told me all things that ever I did:
   is not this the Christ?" Observe first, when she did go back to the
   men, she had but one aim and that was to bring them to Jesus. She
   cries, "Come, see." She did not tell them anything about their sin at
   the time, nor try to reform their habits. She called them at once to
   Him who could set them right. She knew that if she could bring them to
   Christ, all things would inevitably come right. It is good for you to
   shoot only at one target. Choose your design and aim at it, but not at
   two objects. Drive away at the souls of men in the name of God to get
   them to Christ, and nothing short of Him. Labor for this. Be willing to
   live for this and to die for this, that men may be saved by Immanuel's
   love, blood and Spirit.

   This Samaritan woman aimed at this object and tried to gain it by an
   exceedingly earnest address. I guarantee you she said it very
   prettily--"Come, come, come, see a Man that told me all things that
   ever I did!" Perhaps with all her charms, with all the softness of her
   winsome tongue, with all the entreaty of her bright eyes, she cried,
   "Come, every one of you; come, see for yourselves, a Man which told me
   all things that ever I did." If you go upon the Lord's errands, take

   your heart with you! Speak every single syllable earnestly and, if you
   are thoroughly alive, you will not need to be taught the way of doing
   it! The way comes naturally to those whose hearts are set upon the end.
   She spoke self-forgetfully--she seemed entirely to have forgotten
   herself and yet she remembered herself--a paradox, but not a
   contradiction. She said, "Come, see a Man which told me all things that
   ever I did."

   She quoted herself and yet if she had thought of herself, she would not
   have said a word on the subject of her own life. She might have feared
   that the men would have replied--"A pretty story that must be!" They
   knew her well and might have turned round and said, "You are a beauty,
   to come here and talk to us in this style!" No, she let them talk of
   her as they pleased. "Come, see a Man which told me all things that
   ever I did." That putting aside of all affectation; that genuine
   simplicity was part of her power. Never try to be otherwise than you
   are. If you have been a great sinner, be ashamed of it, but do not be
   ashamed of that love which saved you from it, so as to refuse to bear
   witness to its power! Put away the thought of what people will think of
   you and only look to what they will think of Jesus for having forgiven
   and renewed you!

   Note how short she was. Ralph Erskine calls her the female preacher. I
   am not so sure of the correctness of the title. If women preached just
   as long as she did, and no longer, no one could find fault with them.
   Her testimony lies all in one verse and is an invitation and a
   question. There needed no more words, no, not another half a word. She
   said exactly enough, for she was successful in leading the men to
   Jesus, who could do the preaching far better than she could. I cannot
   call her words a sermon--at any rate, you would not care for me to
   preach so briefly! However, brevity is a great virtue. Do not crave to
   be fluent, only ask to be earnest. Then, how vivacious she was. "Come,
   see a Man." The words are all alive and very far from being dull and
   heavy. "Come, see." It is almost as laconic as Julius Caesar's famous
   dispatch--"I came, I saw, I conquered." "Come, see a Man which told me
   all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?"

   Then, it was so sensible. There is a dispute about the exact force of
   what the woman said, but most of those who give us precise translations
   differ from our common version. It is what she meant and believed, but
   not exactly what she said. She probably said, "Come, see a Man which
   told me all things that ever I did: Can this be the Christ?"--or, "This
   is not the Christ, is He?" She did not say He was, but she suggested it
   with great modesty for the men to examine. She believed that Jesus was
   the Christ, but she knew that men do not like to be taught by such as
   she and so she humbly threw it out for their examination. "Can this be
   the anointed One whom we are expecting? Come and judge."

   She did not express all she believed, lest she should provoke them to
   opposition--she was adept and wise. She fished after the manner of her
   Master, for she could not but feel how dexterously He had fished for
   her. She was an apt scholar and humbly copied the Friend who had
   blessed her--"Come, see a Man who told me all things that ever I did:
   can this possibly be the Christ?" This led them to come, if it was only
   to set the woman right! Possibly they thought her a poor, mistaken
   woman, but, in their superior wisdom, they would look into the matter
   and so the thing she desired was granted her. Oh, to have our wits
   about us for Jesus!

   But the argument is exceedingly strong, let her put it how she may.
   "This Man has told me all things that ever I did." She might have said,
   if she thought it wise to say it, "He must be the Christ." And that is
   my last point, namely, the grand argument drawn from herself and
   adapted to the men. Observe the force of her reasoning. His power to
   read her heart and manifest her to herself, was conclusive evidence to
   her that a special anointing was upon Him. But before I get at that I
   must have you examine more fully the whole of the woman's little
   message, of which it was a part. It divides itself into two parts. You
   have been looking for my firstly and secondly all this while, and now
   you shall have them! There are two parts in her sermon. The first is
   the invitation--"Come, see a Man which told me all things that ever I
   did." The second is the argument--"Is not this the Christ?"

   I. Consider at once THE INVITATION. It is a clever as well as a genuine
   and hearty invitation. She says, "Come, see." This was putting it most
   fairly and men like a fair proposal--and the Holy Spirit works by means
   which suit the mind. She does not say, "You must and shall believe what
   I say." No, no, she is too sensible. She says, "Come and see for
   yourselves," and that is exactly what I want to say to every
   unconverted person here, this morning. My Lord Jesus is the most
   precious Savior that I ever dreamed of. Come and test Him! He is
   altogether lovely and He has blessed my soul unspeakably, but I do not
   want you to believe because of my saying so--come and see for
   yourselves! Can anything be fairer?

   Seek Him by prayer. Trust Him by faith. Test His Gospel for yourselves.
   It is an old-fashioned exhortation--"Oh taste and see that the Lord is
   good!" And, again, "Prove Me now, says the Lord of Hosts." In fact,
   this is Christ's own word to the first disciples, "Come and see," and
   they used it when pleading with others, saying to them, "Come and see."
   Moreover, this woman's invitation throws the responsibility upon them.
   She says, "Come and see." Thus would I say to you--If you do not come
   and see, I cannot help it and I cannot help you, either. I cannot stand
   sponsor for you--use your own judgments and clear your own consciences.
   Come and see on your own accounts. If you do not, then the blame must
   rest with you. If you do, then your personal investigation will be sure
   to end in a blessing.

   O dear Hearers, I may preach the Gospel to you, but I cannot go to
   Christ in your place! It is mine to entreat and persuade and to use
   every kind of means by which I may get you to the Savior, but it is a
   personal matter with each of you! Oh that the Holy Spirit would lead
   you to come, yourselves, to Jesus, for it must be your own act and deed
   through His blessed working upon your nature! You must come, you must
   repent, you must believe, you must lay hold on eternal life for
   yourselves! Nothing but personal religion can possibly save you. The
   woman's call was a good exhortation in that respect.

   Then, is it not pleasantly put, so as to prove the sympathy of the
   speaker? She does not say, as she might have said, "Go, see a Man."
   No--"Come, see a Man," as much as to say, "Come along. I will go with
   you and lead the way. You shall not say I have seen enough of Him and
   do not care to go again, and now want to send you packing there alone
   because I am tired of Him. No, come! Come along! Come with me--we will
   all go together. The more I have seen of Him the more I want to see.
   Come, see the wondrous Man." Dear Friends, when you try to win a soul,
   do not try the, "go," system, but use the, "come," system! When man
   cries, "I cannot go to Christ," or, "I will not go to Christ," look at
   him through your tears and cry out, "Friend, I am a sinner like
   yourself, and have no hope but in the precious blood of Jesus. Come,
   let me pray with you! Let us go to Jesus together!"

   Then, when you pray, do not say, "Lord, I am one of your saints and
   come to you bringing this sinner." That may be true, but it is not a
   wise way of speaking. Cry, "Lord, here are two sinners that deserve
   Your wrath and we come to ask You in Your pity to give the Savior to us
   and renew our hearts by Your Spirit." That is the way God helps
   soul-winners to draw others--when we say, "Come," let us lead the way
   ourselves. What you wish another to do, it will be wise to do yourself,
   for example has more power than precept! How would you like the sinner
   to turn round upon you and say, "You may well give away advice when you
   do not intend to use it, yourself." No, but, "Come, see a Man that told
   me all things that ever I did." A Sister's heart spoke out in that
   word, "Come."

   Again, what a blessed vanishing of the speaker there is! I have heard
   of Brothers whose preaching is spoiled because they are so
   self-conscious. The man wishes you to feel that he is speaking in
   first-rate style and is an eminent divine. When he has finished, the
   common exclamation is, "I never heard such a clever man." But he was
   not so wise as he might have been or should have been, for he who
   preaches rightly makes you forget himself! In fact, the observation
   about him, if it comes out at all, is in this fashion--"I did not
   detect any eloquence; anybody might have talked like that, but somehow
   I have felt as I never felt before."

   The fish knows little about the angler, but he knows when he has
   swallowed the hook. When the Truth of God has gone right home to the
   hearer's heart, the form of speech is of little consequence. This woman
   does not say anything to make the Samaritan men admire her, but she
   draws them to Jesus with the exhortation, "Come, see a Man." What she
   does mention about herself is with the design of extolling the Savior.
   That is a grand sentence of John the Baptist, "He must increase, but I
   must decrease." Less, less, less of John, that there may be all the
   more of Christ! There is but one great universe and Christ and you are
   in it. The more space you occupy, there must be so much the less for
   Jesus. When you get less and less there is more for Jesus--and when you
   reach the vanishing point, then Jesus is All in All--and that is
   exactly what you should aim at!

   This sensible woman's invitation deserves to be copied by every worker.

   II. Now for THE ARGUMENT, with which I close. An argument lies
   concealed here and if you look at the text a minute or two, you will
   discover it. She conceals it because she is persuaded that they have
   already agreed to it. It is this--"If Jesus is the Christ, the
   Anointed, then it is fit that you should come with me and see Him." She
   does not argue that point because every Samaritan agreed to it. If
   Jesus is the Christ, then we ought to go and listen to Him, look at Him

   and become His followers. Alas, my dear Hearers, I am obliged to urge
   that argument with many of you because you are not so practical as
   these Samaritans.

   You believe that Jesus is the Christ. I suppose every man and woman of
   you does that. Why, then, do you not believe in Him as your Savior? You
   never had a doubt about His Godhead--why is He not your God? "If I tell
   you the truth," says Christ, "why do you not believe Me?" If this is
   the Anointed One whom God has sent to take away the sins of men, why
   have you not sought Him, that He may rid you of your sins? If this is
   the Propitiation which God has set forth, why have you not accepted
   this Propitiation? If this is the Fountain wherein sin can be washed
   away, why are you not washed? There is no reason in your course of
   action--it is illogical and irrational. If there is a Savior, the man
   who is taught right reason vows that he will have Him! If there is a
   fountain that can wash away sin, he resolves to be washed in it--if he
   can get right with God by any process, he hastens to be rectified. I
   say this woman did not argue the point because it did not need arguing.
   It goes without saying and there let it stand.

   But what she did argue was this--"This Man who was just now sitting on
   the well, is He not the Christ?" How did she prove it? First, she did
   as good as say, "He must be Christ because He has revealed me to
   myself--He has told me all things that ever I did." The words are wide.
   Stop, dear woman, surely He has not revealed all your life, certainly
   not in words! He has revealed your unchastity, but nothing else. But
   she was right. Were you ever out in a black and murky night when a
   single lightning flash has come? It has only struck one oak in the
   field, but in so doing it has revealed all the landscape. It struck one
   object, but all around you was light as day for the moment! So, when
   the Lord Jesus Christ revealed this woman's lustfulness, she saw
   clearly the whole of her life at a single view and the Lord had,
   indeed, told her all things that ever she did!

   Do you wonder that she said, "Is not this the Christ?" Beloved, no one
   proves Himself to be truly anointed unless He begins by showing you
   your sins! If any teacher leads you to hope that, without repentance,
   or any sense of sin, you may be saved, he is not of Christ! I charge
   you, fling away any hope which is not consistent with your own entire
   hopelessness apart from Jesus! If you have not known yourself a sinner,
   you cannot know Christ as a Savior. Some are preaching, nowadays, a
   dry-eyed faith and men seem to jump into assurance as if there were no
   new birth, no conviction of sin and no repentance. But it is not
   so--"You must be born again." That birth is not without pangs. Trust in
   Christ brings a hatred of sin and a mourning because of it. A man
   cannot hate what he does not know, but this woman was made to see her
   sin and that sight proved that the Messiah was dealing with her.

   The non-repentance prophets cry, "Peace, peace," where there is no
   peace! They film the sore, but Jesus puts the knife into it, lays it
   wide open and makes the patient see the gangrene of the wound--and then
   He closes it up and, with His heavenly ointment makes a sure cure of
   it. There is no binding up the heart that was never broken! There is no
   comforting a man who has always been comfortable! There is no making a
   man righteous who always was righteous--there is no washing a man who
   has no filthiness. No, and this is what the Messiah does--He lays bare
   the disease and this is a proof that He is sent of God because He does
   not adopt the flimsy, flattering mode of deceivers, but goes straight
   to the truth. Her argument is--He must be the Messiah, for He revealed
   me to myself!

   Secondly, He must be the Messiah, for He has revealed Himself to me.
   "No sooner did I see my filthiness than I saw at once that He was every
   way ready to cleanse me." A sinner's eye is never ready to see the
   Savior till first it has seen the sin. When the man sees despair
   written across the face of human strength, then he turns and sees hope
   mildly beaming from the kind eyes of the Son of Man--but not till then.
   Jesus has revealed Himself and now she says, "I see that He knows me
   and knows all about me." Wonderful it is how the Gospel robe exactly
   fits a man--when he gets it and puts it on, he feels that He who made
   this garment knew His form. Perhaps you have some special weakness or
   singular deformity, but you soon perceive that Jesus knew all about it,
   for His salvation exactly meets the lack.

   There is a bath. Ah, He knew I was filthy. There is a robe. Ah, He knew
   I was naked. There is eye salve--He knew that I was blind. Here is a
   ring for my finger--He knew I wanted a forget-me-not to keep me in
   memory of mercy received. Here are shoes for my bare feet and a banquet
   for my griping hunger. Every need is taken care of and this proves the
   Omniscience of my Savior! "Therefore," she said, "He knows all about
   me. He must be infinitely wise; He must be the Christ." This is good
   arguing, is it not?

   Then she seemed to say to them, too, "This is a great deal more to me
   than it can be to you, for He has dealt personally with me and,
   therefore, I abide in my assurance that He is the Christ. But go and
   learn the same arguments for your-

   selves." Brothers and Sisters, if the Lord Jesus Christ had told this
   woman all that ever her third husband did, it would have had far less
   power over her than telling her all she had done, herself! When
   conviction comes personally home and the discovery is all about your
   own state and character, it has a special power over your heart and
   mind to make you say, "This is the Christ." Also, my Brethren, at the
   remembrance of my Lord's surgery when I was wounded and sorely broken,
   I am ready to cry, "See how He handled me! Never was a hand so strong
   and yet so tender! Never a physician with such a lion's heart and such
   a lady's hand. I can feel His strength as He holds me up and I can feel
   His tenderness as He embraces me. Surely He is the Anointed and sent of
   the Lord to bind up the brokenhearted, for He has bound up my broken
   heart! The case is proven to me--come and experience the same
   conviction within yourselves."

   Moreover, and perhaps there is force in this which has not been
   noticed, she says, "Come, see," as much as to say, "You may come, I
   know, for when I came to the well, He did not look daggers at me. And
   when I did not give Him water, He did not grow hot with me and say,
   'Disrespectful woman, I will not speak to you.' No, but I was at home
   with Him in a moment! Come, see a Man who made Himself so at home with
   me that He told me all that ever I did. I am sure He must be the
   Messiah. The Messiah is to come to open the blind eyes and He must
   necessarily be among the blind to perform the miracle! He is to fetch
   prisoners out of prison and they are the lowest class that are in
   prison--and yet He goes to them! So, come along! I will go first and
   introduce you to Him."

   That is the woman's little speech and how good it is! I am going to add
   a bit to it which she did not know, but which we know. I wish I knew
   how to say something that would make you unconverted ones hurry to
   Christ, but if anything ought to do it, it is this. Suppose you never
   do come to Christ in this life and die without Him? God grant you may
   not die without having listened to Him and received Him, but if you do,
   you will be awakened at the Last Day from your grave with the blast of
   a terrible trumpet and with the cry of, "Come to judgment! Come to
   judgment! Come away!" Whether you will, or not, you will have to come
   and see a Man sitting upon the Great White Throne, judging the nations!

   And do you know what He will do with you, then? He will tell you all
   things that ever you did--and as the scenes pass before your mind's eye
   and as your own words go ringing, again, through your ears, you will be
   sorely distressed! Perhaps this morning's scene will be revived before
   you and conscience will tell you, "You were at the Tabernacle that
   morning. The Gospel was put plainly to you, by one who in his heart
   longed for you to be saved, but you did despite to all those entreaties
   and turned away." I tell you it will be your Hell for Jesus to tell you
   all things that ever you did! And you will then see the argument--"Is
   not this the Christ?" But, alas, He will be no Savior to you, for you
   refused Him! He will, then, tell you, "I called, but you refused. I
   stretched out My hands, but no man regarded."

   Still shall proceed that awful tale of all things that ever you did,
   concluding with this--you refused mercy, you rejected Jesus, you turned
   away from salvation, you would not have this Man to save you and,
   therefore, have you come to have your past made the fuel for your
   everlasting burning! God grant that no one, here, may ever come to
   that! No, if I had the task to select one man out of this congregation
   that would have to spend an eternity in having his life rehearsed to
   him, where should I find him? No, I cannot see one that I dare to pitch
   upon, not one--not one--not even the worst man or woman here! I would
   not if I could!

   O God, of Your mercy suffer no one here to know the terror of being
   driven away forever from Your Presence and the Glory of your power, for
   Jesus' sake. Amen.

One War Over and Another Begun

   (No. 1679)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 17, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord, Gideon
   said, Alas, O Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to
   face. And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto you; fear not: you
   shall not die. Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and
   called it Jehovah-Shalom." Judges 6:22-24.

   These Midianites were wandering Bedouins from Arabia and the East
   country round about the Holy Land. They were masters of the art of
   plundering and knew no hearts of compassion. They generally lived a
   hard life, themselves, and when they had an opportunity to feast on the
   spoils of others, they rioted without stint and left a famine behind
   them. Most fitly does the Scripture compare them to grasshoppers, for
   both in number and in destructive force they were like those terrible
   devourers. God had brought them upon Israel to scourge that nation
   because it had been so foolish and so ungrateful as to set up the gods
   of the heathen and to forget the one mighty God who was so especially
   and graciously their Patron and Defender. They were impoverished and
   ground down to the very last degree by these plunderers who left no
   food either for men or cattle.

   The poor Israelites, creeping forth from their dens and caves,
   attempted to carry on the work of farming and sowed the land, but when
   the time came for reaping, the marauders came forth once more, took
   away their harvest and despoiled their pastures again. Then, as usual,
   Israel cried unto Jehovah and His ears were opened to their groaning.
   Their afflictions made them weary of their idols and caused them to
   say, "We will return unto our first husband, for it was better with us,
   then, than now." God in His great mercy raised up for them a deliverer,
   Gideon, a mighty man of valor, who distinguished himself in various
   skirmishes with the foe! His name was already a terror to Midian, for
   he who dreamed of the barley cake which smote the tent, and it lay
   along, said to his fellow-- "This is none other than Gideon, the son of
   Joash."

   Gideon's character has never been sufficiently admired--Scripture
   names, much less bright than his, have been preferred before him by the
   general ministry, yet he deserves far better treatment. He was a man
   gentle and yet strong, cautious and yet venturesome. He was a searching
   inquirer and an intense Believer. While he was a sort of foreshadowing
   of David, he had much of the afterglow of Joshua. He was a truly great
   man, though his later days were overshadowed by a grievous religious
   error and a sad moral fault. Despite his failings, he was one of the
   greatest of the heroes of faith. He was not in a hurry to venture upon
   a pitched battle, but waited his time, and then, by a sudden and
   unexpected attack, he struck the whole host with panic so that they
   fled at once and Midian was smitten as one man.

   The leaders fled--two of the minor ones, Oreb and Zeeb, the raven and
   the wolf--are first captured and, by-and-by, the greater generals, who
   had fled, first of all, are taken by the victorious band. The leaders
   were ahead of all the others in flight. In later days the destruction
   of their mighty ones became a proverbial curse, "Make their nobles like
   Oreb and like Zeeb--yes, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna."

   Let us think for a while of Gideon in order that we may see that we,
   ourselves, are, or may be, somewhat parallels with him. We may not have
   to smite the Bedouin as he did, but unto a spiritual warfare God has
   called many of us. And though He intends to use us and to get unto
   Himself victory by us, yet it may be that at this moment we are in
   fear. We are now passing through the same mental processes as those
   which educated Gideon and we are being prepared, thereby, for future
   conflict and conquest. I shall begin by asking you to dwell, for a
   minute, upon Gideon's sigh for peace, for he loved not war, but pined
   for quiet. He called the name of the altar, "Jehovah-Shalom," which the
   margin reads, "The Lord Send Peace." You see, therefore, that deeper
   down in his spirit than any desire for warlike honor, there was a
   yearning after peace.

   Gideon wanted not the spoils of princes. He only desired to plow, sow
   and reap in peace. And do you wonder at it, when the evils of war were
   all around? He had, for a long time, seen, in the cases of his friends
   and neighbors, the desolating effects of war--their property was taken
   from them, their bread was stolen out of their mouths, their children
   were slain--and they, themselves, made to hide away upon the tops of
   mountains or in caverns among the hills. Life became intolerable amid
   such privations and dangers. Gideon must have felt his heart swell with
   grief and indignation as he looked upon the remnant of Israel hunted
   like partridges upon the mountains--though once they had dwelt safely--
   every man under his vine and under his fig tree.

   The Bedouin styled the valley of Jezreel, "the meadows of God"--how
   grievous to see those fat pastures trod down by the feet of the
   invaders! Ah, little can you and I imagine the horrors of war! We read
   of it and our sympathies are touched, but we know not the multiplied
   murders, the painful wounds, the desolating rapine and the fierce
   crimes which attend the track of armies. If we saw battle with our own
   eyes, we would, with burning fervor, cry, "Send us peace in our days,
   good Lord." Moreover, Gideon had not only seen war, but he sighed for
   peace because he was, himself, feeling the mischief of it. The dread of
   the conflict had come to his own mountain farm at Abiezer.

   There he was, threshing wheat by the wine press, in an unusual place,
   in an inconvenient place--that he might hide a little grain for
   winter's food--from the Midianites who were eager to devour it. Yes,
   and when carnage smokes at your own door and rapine is at your own
   gate--when you, yourself, are straitened and are hiding for fear, then
   comes from the deep recesses of the spirit the cry, "Oh, that God would
   send us peace, for this is a weary oppression; these ravens and wolves
   utterly devour us." The way of peace was sufficiently well known to
   Gideon--the Prophet of the Lord had indicated to the people that the
   only way of peace was for Israel to return to Jehovah, her God. The
   great sin of departure from the glorious living God was set before them
   and they could readily draw the inference that they would never have
   peace from their enemies till, first of all, they had made their peace
   with God.

   They must surrender to their Sovereign, renew their loyalty and then He
   would drive out the foe from their land. They must confess their
   transgressions and renew their covenant and then they would obtain
   deliverance. Then would the ancient promise be fulfilled, "One should
   chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight." Gideon probably
   knew this before the Prophet came--it was deeply imprinted on his
   thoughtful spirit and, as he was a man of faith in God, he did not
   doubt but that if Israel returned to Jehovah, then peace would follow.
   While Gideon is meditating and working, an angel appears to him and
   gives him the assurance that with him, at least, God was at peace.

   The Covenant Angel said to him, "Jehovah is with you, you mighty man of
   valor." I think his spirit ought greatly to have rejoiced at that
   assurance and, perhaps, it did, for what better thing can happen to any
   man than to receive such a token for good? If God is for us, who can be
   against us? We know how sweet is the assurance that being justified by
   faith we have peace with God. It is well with us when we are assured
   that the Lord is with us, our helper, our shield, our portion forever
   and ever! But there arose in Gideon's mind a grave anxiety. His was a
   very careful, thoughtful soul, for he was a man of
   prudence--large-hearted, far-seeing and given to look at things coolly
   and steadily--and there arose in his heart a question, serious and
   vital, "Is this the voice of God to me, or am I deluded? Is God at
   peace with me, or am I like the rest, plunged in a horrible warfare
   against the living God?"

   Therefore he puts a question and he asks for a sign that he might make
   sure of what he was about. Brothers and Sisters, in spiritual matters
   you and I had need be sure! If we have peace within our spirit, let us
   make certain that it is the peace of God, for there are still voices
   that cry, "Peace, peace," where there is no peace. Siren songs still
   charm men to ruin with their dulcet notes. Still does the fatal river
   flow most smoothly as it approaches the dreadful cataract. Beware of
   that Word of the Lord, "When they shall say, Peace and safety; then
   sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child;
   and they shall not escape."

   None are more quiet than the ungodly when they are given up to a strong
   delusion. The Psalmist says of them, "There are no bands in their
   death: but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as other
   men; neither are they plagued like other men." It was no so with
   Gideon--his anxiety made itself visible. He was not the man to leap at
   a shadow--he sought for substance. If he was to have peace, he must
   have it from God. If he was to be delivered, he longed to have victory
   plain and permanent. The favor which he asked was requested because
   anxiety troubled him and he wished to make assurance doubly sure. He
   desired to know from God, Himself, that his mission was authentic and
   his success certain.

   I believe that many of us have been and, perhaps, are, in Gideon's
   position. Of course we have not his errand, but we have one of our own
   and we are troubled because we are not personally sure of our peace. We
   are grieved by our past sins and their consequences. This is the lot of
   many men. "Conscience makes cowards of us all"--and when the mighty
   Spirit of God convicts us of sin--then sin becomes a second sorrow. No,
   worse than that, for if sorrow chastens us with whips, sin scourges us
   with scorpions. We are consumed by God's anger, but by His wrath we are
   troubled. The mind is tossed to and fro and is confounded, but even in
   its confusion it seeks the true rest and longs to gain peace in God.
   Like the needle in the compass, it is agitated and disturbed, yet still
   it knows its pole and trembles towards it.

   It will never be still till it reaches the point of its rest. Have you
   ever been in that condition? I know you have if the Lord has loved you
   and ordained you to His work! Has God, at such a time, sent you a
   message of mercy? Have you searched the Scriptures and found a precious
   promise? Have you heard a faithful servant of God preach under his
   Master's anointing and have you been comforted? Even then, I should not
   wonder if the darkening thought has arisen like a cloud, "Is this the
   right comfort for me? May I really enjoy it? Will it be presumption or
   assurance?" There is often a fine line, thin as a razor's edge, between
   the two--and woe unto him who makes a mistake about it! O God, save us
   from carnal security! Prevent our crying, "Peace, peace, where there is
   no peace."

   Better that we write bitter things against ourselves, if they are true,
   than that we say smooth things and flatter ourselves to destruction.
   Therefore, I should not wonder if you are asking the Lord to give you a
   token for good. You are praying to Him and saying, "I will not be
   comforted except You comfort me--Your dove shall find no rest for the
   sole of her foot except it is in the Ark with the true Noah, in whom is
   rest." As for me, I will take no cup of consolation except that which
   Jesus proffers when He gives it me with His own pierced hands. If
   washed, it shall be in Jesus' blood! If clothed, it shall be in His
   righteousness!

   From Gideon's longing, panting desire to obtain peace with God and then
   peace for his country, we turn to look a little further into Gideon's
   fear which he met with in the way of peace. "An angel" appeared to
   him--so says the text in the Authorized Version--but in truth it was
   the Angel of Jehovah and this should have comforted him, even as it has
   comforted us! One would have thought that Gideon would have leaped for
   joy when he beheld his God veiled in angelic form, but instead, the
   shadow of death fell upon him! Here was a man panting for peace and
   firmly following the way of peace, and yet afraid with a deadly fear!

   Peace cannot be had except by our drawing near to God and the Lord's
   drawing near to us, but as soon as this process commences, poor
   humanity shrinks from the interview and is melted with fear. "When
   Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord, Gideon said, Alas,
   O Lord God! For because I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to
   face." It usually happens that when God is bringing men into peace with
   Himself--while the operation is going on thoroughly and soundly--there
   is a degree of trembling in the soul. I suspect that conversion which
   has no trembling in it! Note the prodigal's cry, "I am not worthy to be
   called your son." Note Peter's bitter weeping and the three days'
   darkness of Saul of Tarsus.

   Even to Believers, the visitations of God are not without overwhelming
   awe. Jacob cries, "How dreadful is this place!" Job abhors himself;
   Moses does exceedingly fear and quake, and Isaiah cries, "Woe is me!"
   Why was Gideon afraid? Not because he was a coward--you will scarcely
   meet with a braver man in all Scripture than this son of Joash-- but
   because even brave men are alarmed at the Supernatural! He saw
   something which he had never seen before--an appearance celestial,
   mysterious, above what is usually seen of mortal men and, therefore, as
   he feared God, Gideon was afraid. When the living God draws very near
   to a soul, even though it is in the Person of Christ Jesus, that soul
   is struck with awe and trembles before the Lord. It cannot well be
   otherwise.

   Remember how it was with the beloved John. "When I saw Him," says
   John--that was, his own dear Master, upon whose breast he had leaned
   his head--"when I," the disciple whom Jesus loved, "saw Him, I fell at
   His feet as dead." You do not wonder, therefore, if a poor soul full of
   doubt and anxiety, vexed with a sense of sin and greatly troubled by
   affliction, is full of fear when Jesus draws near! Though He comes with
   no feeling but of love, no thought but of mercy, no sentence but of
   free forgiveness, yet the heart is awe-struck at the wondrous sight!
   Alas, some of you know not what it is to have the Lord drawing near to
   your spirits. If you did, you would not think it strange that certain
   awakened ones have acted in a singular way and, for a while, have
   forgotten to eat bread!

   Daniel says, "I was left alone and saw this great vision, and there
   remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into
   corruption and I retained no strength." When this glorious God comes
   near to the soul, it is a solemn visitation, and the mind is bowed
   under it! Moreover, Gideon had been ill-taught by tradition. There was
   a rumor abroad which was derived from the Truth of God and yet was
   false, namely, that no man could see a heavenly Being and live. It is
   true that the Lord expressly told His servant Moses that he could not
   see His face and live. But He did not say, "You cannot see an angel and
   live." Nor had He said, "You cannot see My veiled Presence and live."
   The tradition was an accretion to the Truth and a corruption of it. We
   may not see the face of God, but we may see Jesus. In fact, we live
   because we see Him!

   Beware of the moss which grows upon a Truth of God! Many a heart bleeds
   because it is wounded by its own imperfect ideas of God and so, when
   God does draw near--when the great Almighty overshadows us--there is a
   slavish dread for which there is no need. "I shall die," he says, "I
   shall die." He sees his sin and, therefore, he thinks that God has come
   in anger to punish him. He feels his weakness and, fainting under it,
   he groans, "I shall die." No, Soul, if God had meant to slay you, He
   would have left you alone! Whom God destroys, He first leaves to the
   madness of his own conceit. He does not take the trouble to show a man
   his sin and reveal to him his transgression, unless He means to pardon
   and save him. If the Lord has taken to strip you, He will clothe you!
   If He makes your righteousness to fade like the leaves of autumn, it is
   because He has a glorious robe with which to array you! Therefore be
   not afraid.

   Besides, Gideon was in a state of mind in which he could be easily cast
   down. He was a brave man, but long affliction had cast a tinge of
   sadness over him. His usual conduct in life is well pictured by the two
   signs which God gave him. When all the people around him were, with
   excitement, like the threshing floor, heated and dry, he, like the
   fleece, was cool and composed. And then, again, when all around him
   like the wet floor, were dampened with discouragement, he, alone,
   remained in his ordinary condition, with not a drop of cowardice within
   him. That was the kind of man Gideon was--calm, quiet, determined,
   brave.

   But, at the moment recorded in our text, he was smarting under a cruel
   oppression, conscious of God's anger for Israel's sin, and overshadowed
   by God's own Presence and, therefore, his mind was ready to rush from
   one fear to another. Only see the beauty of it--that he always tells
   his fear to God, always goes to Him for comfort and, therefore-- always
   obtains succor! The brave man is not he who sees no fear, but he who,
   seeing the danger, rises superior to it. Such was Gideon, tossed to and
   fro from one fear to another, but never tossed off from his God and so,
   always sure to right himself. One thing is noteworthy, namely, that
   Gideon's greatest fear arose out of a sign which he had, himself, asked
   for. He said, "Show me a sign," and when he had that sign, namely,
   God's coming to him, then it was that he was afraid.

   Be very cautious how you ask for signs, for they may work your
   discouragement rather than your comfort. I have known some say, "I
   shall not believe I am a child of God unless I feel a deep sense of
   sin." And when they have entered into that feeling, they have
   exclaimed, "I will never again ask for this!" I have heard of others
   who thought they could come to Christ if they were gently drawn--and
   the Lord has been gently drawing them--and then they have wished that
   they had been more troubled and distressed! They imagine that they
   could have believed more readily had their despair been greater--
   certainly a strange notion! We are always busy in manufacturing fresh
   doubts--and for raw material we use the very tokens for which we so
   earnestly besought the Lord!

   We cry aloud, "Show me a token for good," and when the token is given,
   we are amazed at being heard and fall to fearing more sadly than
   before. Therefore pray for such gifts with bated breath and say twice
   over concerning such things, "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You
   will." All this while Gideon had one Truth before him which ought to
   have prevented all his fears, for the Lord had spoken to him, and said,
   "Go, in this your might, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the
   Midianites: have not I sent you?" Look, he goes home fearing that he
   will die, and yet that could not be! How could he die if he was to
   deliver Israel? He must be a live man to do that and yet, you see, he
   forgets to reason for his own comfort, but takes care to argue for his
   fears.

   Have I never seen my Hearers doing this? I have often caught myself at
   it--refusing to use my logic for the strengthening of my faith--but
   perverting reason in order to assist my unbelief! Is not this foolish
   and wicked? Too often we are industrious in the fabrication of
   discomfort and utterly idle in the search for joy. This is folly and
   yet, better men than we are have fallen into this fault, too. The Lord
   save us from it! In drawing near to God is our peace and if, in that
   process, a sense of the Presence of God casts us down and creates a
   more poignant sorrow than we had at the first, let us not, there-

   fore, shrink from the process, but push on with all our might! As our
   safety lies in coming to God, to Him we must approach at all hazards.
   If He seems to stand before us with a drawn sword in His hand, let us
   run upon the point of it! If even our God is a consuming fire, let us
   still draw near to Him, for this is, indeed, the high privilege of
   saints. "Our God," that is our God in Christ Jesus, "is a consuming
   fire." Who, then, shall dwell with the devouring fire?

   Now let us spend a few minutes in considering God's comfort of His
   servant. "The Lord said unto him, Shalom-- peace be unto you; fear not:
   you shall not die." The Lord would not have His Gideons disturbed in
   mind. If we are to trouble the enemy, we must not be troubled,
   ourselves. Notice, Brothers and Sisters, the great power of God in
   speaking home the Truth. Suppose I salute you with, "Brothers and
   Sisters, peace be to you." That would be a sweet word, but when the
   Lord says it, you feel the peace, itself! Suppose Peter had stood up in
   that boat which was tossed upon the Galilean Lake and had said to the
   waves, "Be still"--the waves would not have taken much notice of
   him--and the whistling blast would have defied him!

   But when Jesus said, "Peace, be still," the rampant lions of the sea
   crouched at His feet and there was a great calm. "Peace!" The word is
   shalom, the word which Gideon borrowed and applied to the altar which
   he raised in obedience to the Lord's bidding. It signifies not only
   quiet, but prosperity, success--"good fortune"--as the multitudes say.
   When God spoke that word home to His dear servant's heart, a great joy
   was born within him to prepare him for his great warfare. The Lord also
   cheered him with, "Fear not." Oh, that charming word--as full as it is
   short--"Fear not." What is there to fear? If God is with you, of whom
   can you be afraid? Gideon feared himself, dreaded his own unfitness and
   un-worthiness, feared in the awful Presence of God. But the Lord said,
   "Fear not," and Gideon's heart grew calm.

   Then the Lord added, "You shall not die," thus meeting the special form
   of his dread. This is what the Lord says to every poor trembler who is
   holding to Him by the desperate grip of faith--"You shall not die. You
   shall not die the second death. You have no sin to die for, for I have
   laid your transgressions on My only-begotten Son. You shall not die,
   for Jesus died. Your spiritual life cannot expire, for your 'life is
   hid with Christ in God' and, because Jesus lives, you shall live also."

   Let us now look at Gideon's memorial. His fears being banished and
   being at perfect peace, Gideon now goes to work. Are any of you
   questioning whether you are saved or not? Do not go out preaching, yet,
   for you may, perhaps, put others into bondage! Are any of you half
   afraid that you are not at peace with God? Be careful what you do!
   Strive after peace lest you weaken your testimony. I remember the
   lesson which I learned from my Sunday school class--I was taught, if
   the other boys were not. Though yet a youth, I was teaching the Gospel
   to boys and I said, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved."
   One of them asked, somewhat earnestly, "Teacher, are you saved?" I
   answered, "I hope so." The boy replied, "Teacher, don't you know?" As
   if he had been sent to push the matter home to me, he further inquired,
   "Teacher, have you believed?" I said, "Yes," "Have you been baptized?"
   I said, "Yes." "Well, then," he argued, "you are saved." I was happy to
   answer, "Yes, I am"--but I had hardly dared to say that before!

   I found that if I had to teach other people the Truth of God, I must
   know and believe its sweet result upon myself. I believe that you will
   seldom comfort others except it is by the comfort with which you,
   yourself, are comforted of God. God would have His people be at peace
   with Him and know that they are so, for if they are fretted within, and
   worried in reference to their God, how can they fight the battles of
   life? When Gideon is fully at peace, what does he begin to do for God?
   If God loves you, He will use you either for suffering or service--and
   if He has given you peace, you must now prepare for war. Will you think
   me odd if I say that our Lord came to give us peace that He might send
   us out to war?

   Gideon's first work was to go and cut down his father's sacred grove
   which stood on the top of the hill, and enclosed an altar to Baal. He
   could not effect this business by day because the foolish worshipers
   would have rallied to the defense of their dumb idol and have
   overpowered the reformer. Therefore, with his 10 men, he performed the
   work by night. I think I see him and his people in the dim darkness,
   with their axes and saws, doing the work as quietly as they could,
   felling all those trees. A splendid clearance was made that night.
   "Now," he cries, "over with that detestable altar to Baal!" Some people
   would have said, "Spare it as a fine piece of antiquity." Yes, and
   leave it to be used again! I say, down with it, for the older it is,
   the more sin it has caused, and the more likely is it that it will be
   venerated again!

   I often wish the Reformers had been more thorough in their destruction
   of idolatrous images and Popish trumpery. In many a parish church of
   this land, everything is ready for the restoration of the Roman
   idolatry. But see, by the Lord's bidding, Gideon piles a new altar of
   earth, or unhewn stone! And when that is done, he fetches his father's
   bullock and

   slays it for a sacrifice! How steadily they went about this
   reestablishment of the pure faith! Look, they use the wood of the grove
   for burning the sacrifice and the heavens are red with the blaze! I
   think I hear the gallant leader say, "Let them wake now; they cannot
   prevent our worshiping the Most High, nor can they cause the grove to
   grow again. By yon beacon-fire, Israel shall gather together to fight
   against Midian and victory shall be ours."

   Beloved, if God has given you peace, go home and begin your reform! I
   would preach up the overthrow of every sin. Down with every idol. Have
   you one left? Over with it and present a sacrifice to God. But to pull
   down is not enough. Plenty of people can do that. Gideon, as we have
   seen, builds an altar to Jehovah. When you are at perfect peace with
   God, think what you can do for Him--think of a new plan of work, or
   consider how to do the old work better-- advance any part of Divine
   Truth that has been forgotten, any ordinance that has been neglected,
   any virtue that has been despised. Especially make prominent Christ
   Jesus, the Altar and Sacrifice so dear to God. When he had built his
   altar, he called it "Jehovah-Shalom," which was done by way of
   thanksgiving for peace received. The inscription declares that "Jehovah
   is our peace." Blessed be His name this day! We have entered on the
   battles of peace, for the Lord God is with us and with His people we
   will go forth to win the peace which He has promised!

   It was a Psalm in two words. It was a song of one verse, infinitely
   sweet. "Jehovah-Shalom"--The Lord Our Peace. Moreover, it was a prayer,
   as the margin puts it--"Jehovah, send peace." If you have peace with
   God, let your next prayer be, "Lord, give peace to all Your people."
   "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem." Work it, O Holy Spirit of Peace!
   Then ask for peace by conquest of an ungodly world for Jesus till the
   first Christmas carol shall be sung again, "Glory to God in the
   highest, peace on earth, goodwill toward men."

   See, Brothers and Sisters, and with that I finish, there may sit here,
   this morning, a young man who does not know what God is going to make
   of him. The capacities of service that God can infuse into a single
   individual are marvelous! At present you are disturbed in mind,
   afflicted in heart, ill at ease--you need perfect peace, but you have
   not found it, yet. Rest not till you have it. At God's own altar, where
   Jesus died, you will find it, and only there. When Jesus' blood makes
   peace with God, there is your peace. Rest not till you are assuredly at
   peace with the Lord of All, so that your soul lies down in green
   pastures and is led by the still waters.

Bochim--Or, the Weepers

   (No. 1680)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST 10, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And it came to pass, when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words unto
   all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and
   wept. And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
   sacrificed there unto the Lord." Judges 2:4, 5

   LET me give an outline of the chapter, that we may put the text into
   its proper setting. God had brought His people out of Egypt and divided
   Jordan that they might march through, dry-shod, into the land which He
   had promised to their fathers. He charged them to drive out the
   Canaanites, a race that had become so loathsome in God's sight that He
   decreed their destruction and appointed the tribes of Israel to be
   their executioners. It was for the good of the universal world that
   this pest-house should be broken up and that the filthy races should be
   destroyed--and God gave His people that charge to carry out.

   Those who quarrel with this arrangement should remember that this is
   not the only instance of aboriginal tribes being driven out by a
   superior race. Our Anglo-Saxon nation drove out the original
   inhabitants of this island, who survived only in the mountains of Wales
   and Cornwall and in the highlands of Scotland. It certainly will not be
   wise, on our part, as Anglo-Saxons, to condemn Israel for doing, under
   Divine command, what our forefathers did for their own aggrandizement.
   Alas, in more modern times, lands have been seized and nations
   extirpated by the white man without Divine warrant or reasonable
   excuse. We do not justify all this, but if any complain of Israel for
   obeying the sentence of God, let them first raise their voices against
   the driving out of ancient races by colonists of our own race!

   The order to slay the Canaanites had a second objective, namely, that
   Israel might dwell, alone, in the land and might keep themselves to
   themselves--the great nonconformists of the universe--separated from
   all the rest of mankind, both by residence and by manners, not
   following the customs of the nations round about them, or falling into
   their sins. That they might be sanctified they were to be separated.
   "The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the
   nations." Now, mark and note right well that it is an evil thing, under
   any pretext, whatever, to depart, in any degree, from the Commandment
   of the Most High God! Whatever may be the Law which God gives, either
   to the whole race or to His chosen, they will find their safety in
   keeping close to it.

   But Israel forgot this. Soldiering was hard work--storming cities and
   warring with men who attacked them with chariots of iron was heroic
   service. All this required strong faith and untiring perseverance and,
   in these virtues the Israelites were greatly deficient. And so, in
   certain places, they said to the Canaanites, "Let us be neighbors. Let
   us dwell together." They thought, perhaps, that they had abundant
   reason for this easy mode of ending the dispute, for those who would
   correct Infallible Wisdom have usually a great deal to say for
   themselves! Certain persons thought, in those days, that the religious
   notion of God's requirements was too severe, that He was, after all, a
   mass of mercy, and that the best thing that they could do was to be
   kindly tolerant of these Canaanites and make the best terms they could
   with them.

   They said that perhaps, after all, it was a pity to be so old-fashioned
   and so rigid in carrying out the Divine order, and it would be better
   to learn something of the civilization of the Canaanites, something of
   their arts and sciences, something of their theory of religion--for men
   ought to have liberal views and believe that there is latent truth in
   all forms of worship. At any rate, it could do no harm to study their
   archaeology and go to their temples to see the gods they worshipped and
   get a general acquaintance with the advanced thought of the period--for
   the Canaanites were a greatly advanced people--they were the advanced
   thinkers of the period! They had thought out he-gods and she-gods, Baal
   and Ashtaroth. And their lesser deities were many. They were, in fact,
   a highly cultured people, always thinking out something fresh.

   So Israel said, "It were a pity to carry out the Divine denunciation
   quite to the letter. Let us tone it down. There are many things to be
   learned from these people. No doubt they have their fine points and we
   must not be too hard upon their imperfections. Therefore let us enter
   into treaties with them and live with them." They did live with them
   and fell into their ways! Tolerance led to imitation and Israel became
   as vile as the heathen whom the Lord had condemned! And the Israelites
   became a mixed race in whose veins there flowed a measure of Canaanite
   blood. Yes, if you depart from God's Word by a hair's breadth, you know
   not where you will end. It needs but a little to degrade the Christian
   into a Ritualist and still less to turn the Ritualist into a Romanist!
   We shall go far if we once start on the downhill road.

   I would to God that in these degenerate times we had back, again,
   somewhat of the stern spirit of the Cameroonians and the Covenanters,
   for now men play fast and loose with God and think that anything they
   please to do will satisfy the Most High. The offal and the refuse will
   suffice for sacrifices for Him. But as to strict obedience to His Word,
   they can by no means abide. Mischief will surely come of this lax state
   of things to the Churches of this day as surely as affliction came
   abundantly to Israel of old!

   Note, next, that whenever one sin is allowed, we may say of it, "Gad, a
   troop comes." It seemed a pardonable sort of sin to be gentle to these
   people and not to obey God's severer Word, but then, what came next?
   Why, soon they, the children of Jehovah, were found worshipping before
   the horrible Baal! Soon they had gone farther and the unclean goddess,
   Ashtaroth, became their delight! And soon they forgot Jehovah
   altogether amid their deities and demons. With these errors in religion
   there had come in all sorts of errors in morals, for every fashion of
   immorality and lewdness defiled the worshippers of Baal-Peer,
   Baal-Berith and Baal- Zebub. Soon the chosen people of God could
   scarcely be distinguished from the heathen nations among which they
   dwelt, or if distinguished at all, it was by their greater sin,
   inasmuch as they were transgressing against superior light and holding
   down their consciences which God had rendered by His teaching much more
   tender than the consciences of those about them!

   I said before that if you turn aside from God's Words by a hair's
   breadth, you know not where it will end. The rail diverges but a little
   where the switches are turned, but before long the branch line is miles
   away from the main track. Backslide a little and you are on the way to
   utter apostasy! The mother of mischief is small as a gnat's egg--hatch
   it and you shall see an evil bird larger than an ostrich! The least
   wrong has in it an all but infinity of evil. You cannot say to sin, "Up
   to here shall you go, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves
   be stayed." Like the sea, when the dyke is broken, it stretches forth
   its hand to grasp all the surrounding country! The beginning of sin is
   like the beginning of strife and that is said to be as the letting out
   of water--no man knows what a flood may come when once the banks are
   burst.

   So Israel went aside farther and farther from God because they regarded
   not their way and did not, in all things, obey the Lord. But then comes
   in a Truth of God which, though it may seem black in the telling, is
   bright in the essence of it. God did not leave His people without
   chastisement. Had He left them alone, to be given up to their idols,
   their case would have been hopeless. For mercy's sake they must be
   punished for their transgression, but this was a gracious punishment,
   that they might not lie and wallow in their transgression and become
   altogether like the swinish nations that surrounded them. God began to
   punish them by their own sin. He suffered the Canaanite nations to grow
   strong, so that they grievously oppressed Israel.

   He put the Israelites under the yoke of those nations which they ought
   to have utterly destroyed. If they would not be conquerors, they would
   be conquered! If they would not lead captivity captive, they should be
   led captives, themselves! The Lord laid His blows upon them thick and
   heavy. But, before He did this, He sent a messenger to rebuke them. It
   is always the Lord's way to have space for repentance before He
   executes vengeance. The axes which were carried before the Roman
   magistrates by the lictors were bound up in bundles of rods. It is said
   that when a prisoner was before the magistrate, the lictor began to
   untie the rods and with these the culprit was beaten--meanwhile the
   judge looked in the prisoner's face and heard his defense. If he saw
   reason for averting the capital sentence because of the repentance
   which the offender expressed, then he only smote him with the rods and
   the axe remained unused.

   But if, when every rod was taken out, the culprit was still hardened
   and the crime was a capital one and clearly proven, then the axe was
   used--and used all the more sternly because space had been given for
   repentance and the rods had been used in vain! When the rod is
   despised, the axe is ready. It is certainly so with God--He waits to be
   gracious, but when patience cannot hope for penitence, then Justice
   takes her turn and her stroke is terrible. The Lord, on this occasion,
   commissioned a special messenger to rebuke these people, for He sent an
   Angel. I leave it to your own judgments

   to discover who this Angel was, if it is discoverable. It may have been
   an ordinary angel, but I think it must have been the Angel of the Lord.
   He is so styled in the fourth verse and, besides, He uses language
   which an ordinary angel could not have used!

   He begins, "I made you go up out of Egypt." Note, He does not say that
   the Lord said this or that, but the Angel, Himself, says it--"I made
   you go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I
   swore unto your fathers." Who could this have been, then, but that
   Covenant Angel who, on other occasions, appeared to holy men and who,
   on this occasion, preached a sermon to the assembled multitude at
   Shiloh? My Brothers and Sisters, you know that our Lord was here among
   men many a time before He came in mortal flesh to suffer and to die. He
   was here, "rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth, and His
   delights were with the sons of men." He was with Abraham under the
   tree; with Jacob at Jabbok; with Joshua by the walls of Jericho; with
   Gideon at the threshing floor and with the three Holy Children in
   Nebuchadnezzar's furnace.

   He was not in such a body as God had prepared for Him when He took upon
   Himself the form of a Servant, but in such a form and fashion as seemed
   most congruous to His Divine Majesty and to the circumstances of those
   He visited. This Angel of the Divine Covenant, whom we delight in, came
   and spoke to this people. Such is the judgment of many who have thought
   most upon it, but I leave it to you to decide. At any rate, it must
   have been grand hearing to hear an angel preach! And grander hearing,
   still, to hear the Angel of the Covenant plead with the covenanted
   ones! Oh, what a sermon! What a sermon it must have been! Scarcely was
   such a Preacher seen on earth! And yet that sermon did not do as much
   good as when the seafaring man, Peter, preached at Pentecost!

   The sermon at Bochim, if I were to sum up its results, ended in
   disappointment. When our adorable Christ, Himself, preached to the men
   of Nazareth, they would have cast Him headlong from the brow of the
   hill, so that all His eloquent words had fallen upon dead ears and no
   good result had come, even, from His instruction. Be not disappointed,
   servant of God, if sometimes you seem to fail! Do not say, "I will give
   it up." Your bread has been cast upon the waters. Wait a while, for
   after many days, you may find it. If Israel is not gathered, God will
   reward you for your toil. It is yours to labor--it is God's to give the
   results--and He does not always grant pleasing results to us at once.
   He did not allot great triumphs to this Angel of the Lord, as we shall
   have to show you.

   It was a great congregation. It was a great Preacher and it was a great
   sermon! And yet there was not a great ingathering. Read the sermon
   through and note that though it is a short one, it is all the greater
   for its brevity. Sermons may grow little by being long and a sermon may
   be great through being short, if it is big with thought as this angelic
   sermon was. He began, first, by telling them what mercies they had
   received. Read the chapter. "I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have
   brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers." Brothers
   and Sisters, this subject should most readily lead us to
   repentance--that God should have dealt so well with us should make us
   grieve that we have behaved so badly to Him!

   Do I address a backsliding child of God? I do not think that any
   exercise is more likely to benefit your heart than to remember what God
   did for you in years gone by. He took you up out of the horrible pit
   and out of the miry clay and set your feet upon a rock. He brought you
   out from the iron bondage of your despair and gave you liberty. He
   broke the yoke of sinful habits and the chains of furious passions. And
   now are you wandering away from Him? Are you making something else to
   be the god of your spirit? If so, be ashamed of your ingratitude and
   let this first head of the Angel's discourse have power upon your mind.
   "You use no other friend so ill"--and yet you have not a friend who can
   be compared with your God. "I beseech you, Brethren, by the mercies of
   God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice" unto your God and
   sin no longer against Him.

   Then the angel passed on to mention the mercies guaranteed to them--"I
   said, I will never break My Covenant with you." Oh, that is a blessed
   theme! If, indeed, you are a Believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Lord has pledged Himself to make you perfect and to bring you Home to
   Himself with exceedingly great joy! You shall not perish. Christ has
   said, "I give unto My sheep eternal life and they shall never perish,
   neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand. My Father, which gave
   them to Me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out
   of My Father's hand." You see the two hands--one inside the other--and
   you are in the middle, enclosed within the palm of Omnipotent
   faithfulness! Jehovah says, "I have loved you with an everlasting
   love." He will never break His Covenant with you!

   Will you wander away from Him who passes by your iniquity,
   transgression and sin, and does not let His anger smoke against you
   forever--He to whom you are joined in an everlasting wedlock which
   shall never know a divorce? Oh, cruel heart! Cruel heart! Can you
   offend against such love as this? Can you break with God when He
   declares that He will never break with you? The Angel pleads this
   longsuffering, eternally-enduring love, and pleads it well. I know of
   no two greater arguments than mercy received and mercy promised. Let us
   not sin against these! May the Holy Spirit hold us fast with these
   cords of love.

   And then the Angel came to close grips with them and said, "You shall
   make no league with the inhabitants of this land; you shall throw down
   their altars; but you have not obeyed My voice: why have you done
   this?" He came to their sin. He put His finger on their failure, their
   omission and their commission. He did not flinch from stating to them
   exactly what their transgression was, nor from demanding, "Why have you
   done this?" And oh, surely, this shall help to lead us to repentance,
   when God, "sets our iniquities before Him; our secret sins in the light
   of His countenance." When we see our sin, we ought to be distressed by
   it and to flee from it, "hot foot," as men say, and be clean rid of it
   once and for all. Oh, may the Spirit of God convicts any wandering one
   here of sin and may he then turn to God with a penitent heart!

   The Angel expostulated in most chosen words, saying, "Why have you done
   this?" Why have you turned away from God? Why have you let your own
   enemies multiply upon you? Why have you been disobedient to the command
   which was given to you so positively? Know you not that cursed is he
   that does the work of the Lord deceitfully? You have acted
   disobediently and you have brought upon yourselves a terrible
   retribution! Why have you done this? Backslider, are you here tonight?
   Have you gone aside from Church fellowship and left the profession of
   religion? Why have you done this? Can you mention a reason which will
   bear the light? We know you cannot! There is no sense in sin, no
   justification for iniquity.

   Ungodliness is madness! Irreligion is irrational. Disobedience to God
   is a breach of every Law of common sense and logic. In God's creation
   it is unreasonable, unnatural, monstrous for the creature to rebel
   against the Creator! Why have you done this? "Turn you, turn you; why
   will you die, O house of Israel?" Then the Angel completed His
   discourse by declaring to them that further chastisements would surely
   follow. He was not sent to preach the Gospel and, therefore, mercy is
   not His theme. He was sent to preach the Law and He did preach it!
   Listen to the judgment which He de-nounces--"Therefore I also said, I
   will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in
   your sides and their gods shall be your ruin"--so some read the
   passage. It was a just but terrible threat that He thus thundered in
   their ears. Notice it! They were to be punished by their own sin. The
   Lord as good as said--"Fou would not drive them out and now I will not
   drive them out. Your negligence and time-serving shall come home to you
   and place thorns in your suffering flesh. Your omission shall sting you
   where you will feel it. You have sowed thistles, and thorns shall stuff
   your pillows."

   Then, next, He tells them how sharp and keen this sin should be to
   them. "They shall be as thorns in your sides," pricking you in one of
   the most tender parts--in the very region of life, itself. Wherever you
   turn, these sins of yours-- these enemies that you spared--shall prick
   you in the side and their gods shall be your ruin. You dote upon their
   false deities and think them your glory, but they shall be your
   dishonor! The heathen may trust in them, but you shall not be able to
   do so. They shall be a snare and a mischief to you. What a sermon that
   was! As I have said, there was a great occasion, a great congregation,
   a great Preacher, a great sermon, and, as far as one could see on the
   spot, a great movement produced.

   Now I want you to notice what looks like a great result and we shall
   talk of it under two heads. The people, when they heard this solemn
   discourse, lifted up their voice and wept, yet they continued as they
   were. How hopeful! How disappointing!

   I. First, HOW HOPEFUL. One could not desire anything better,
   apparently, than this. They were all attentive hearers. There was not
   one that looked about him, or that forgot the pointed words that were
   spoken. They all seemed to open their ears wide and take in the Divine
   admonition. There they stood before the Lord, all of them amazed and
   confounded, while the Angel delivered His solemn message and then
   returned to Him that sent Him. It is a great thing to win people's
   attention and it is not everyone that can do it, for there are
   congregations that act as if the Word of God had nothing to do with
   them, leaving the poor preacher to prophesy to dead walls. These
   Israelites took the warning and

   drank in the Truth of God. They were attentive hearers and anybody
   would have said, "Blessed be God, that sermon has done a great work.
   Blessed be God for such an attentive congregation! The nails are
   fastened in a sure place."

   Moreover, they were very feeling people, for they felt what they heard.
   What would you think, tonight, if the congregation should suddenly cry
   out? "They lifted up their voice and wept"--wept aloud! Orientals, you
   know, are generally louder in their demonstrations than we are of a
   chillier climate, but still it must have been a solemn sight to notice
   men and women, together, loudly lamenting their transgressions! I have
   no doubt that many who were there at that time were right with God and
   said, "What a wonderful opportunity! Glory be to God for such a
   revival! That one sermon has stirred the people through and through.
   Thank God that He has sent such a messenger with so fitting a message
   and blessed it so, for certainly these people are all converted,
   otherwise they would not cry out and weep."

   They were all sorrowful hearers as well as attentive and feeling
   hearers. Out of the whole company there was not one that laughed, not
   one that was indifferent, not one who scorned and disregarded the
   message, but, as far as the text goes, the statement is that all
   unanimously lifted up their voice and wept. Heaviness was upon them!
   Their souls were exceedingly sorrowful! They expressed their sorrow in
   a great and bitter cry and, meanwhile, their tears flowed abundantly,
   even as when the rock was smitten in the desert and the waters gushed
   forth! They were all turned into weepers and they called the name of
   that place, Bochim, or, the Place of Weepers. You would think, "Surely
   this is full of promise--every eye is filled with tears as they stand
   before God!"

   Alas, that such drops did not precede a shower of Grace, but passed
   away as the morning cloud! Yes, and they all became professing hearers,
   for as soon as ever that service was over, they held another and, "They
   sacrificed unto Jehovah." They avowed themselves to be Jehovah's
   servants and they took the sacrifice which He had appointed and offered
   it for their sins and outwardly they, all of them, became ardent
   worshippers of the Most High and true penitents! Well, dear Friends,
   all this looks very hopeful because it is what we may expect when God
   presses home the Law upon the consciences of men. When sin is laid
   before a man, should he not weep? Hope glitters in every tear! Oh that
   men were sane enough to weep for their transgressions!

   I am amazed that some of you can read your Bibles with dry eyes.
   Unsaved, rejecting the Savior--can you read the four Evangelists
   without weeping? That Savior whom the Jews crucified you reject, and
   so, in fact, you crucify Him, too! Can you read the Ten Commandments
   without an aching heart? You know that these are 10 great pieces of
   artillery, all aimed at you for your destruction, since you have
   offended God by the breach of His Law! Why, surely, you ought scarcely
   to sleep at night, lest God's mighty judgment should fall upon your
   guilty heads while you are asleep! It is not amazing at all that people
   should cry out and weep--the wonder is that every sanctuary where the
   Law is preached and where the Gospel is preached--should not become a
   Bochim, or a place of weepers!

   Oftentimes this deep emotion does come with true conversion--often,
   though not always--as I shall have to show you. Men convinced of sin
   may well weep. I have seen a strong man weep under a sense of his
   guilt--weep as though the fountains of his eyes would be exhausted--and
   the eyes, themselves, would turn to coals of fire. Frequently people
   are unable to restrain themselves and break out, even, in the midst of
   the congregation, and cry to God for mercy! It is not amazing--it is
   what we should expect! It is not undesirable, for it is an effect which
   frequently accompanies real conversion to God. It may well go with
   sorrow for sin, and sorrow for sin is essential to eternal life.
   Repentance is an old-fashioned doctrine which, in these days, has been
   despised, but, if I stand alone, I will bear testimony for it!

   They say that repentance is nothing at all--that it is merely,
   according to the Greek, a change of mind. That shows what little Greek
   they know! A little of such knowledge is a dangerous thing. A pity that
   they do not learn more. Repentance is a change of mind, but do you say
   that it is only a change of mind? That is a pretty big, "only." A
   change of mind, a radical change of mind--from the love of sin to the
   love of holiness--is that a small affair? It is always attended with
   sorrow and regret for past sin and, if there is a man here who thinks
   that he will get to Heaven by a dry-eyed faith, he will be mistaken! He
   that never mourned for sin has never rejoiced in the Lord!

   If I can look back upon my past life of sin and say, "I have no grief
   over it," why, then I should do the same, again, if I had the
   opportunity! And this shows that my heart is as perverse as ever it was
   and I am still unregenerate. Dear Mr. Rowland Hill used to say that
   faith and repentance were his daily companions as long as he lived, and
   that, if he had any thought of regret at entering Heaven, it would be
   to think that he might have to part with his dear friend, Repentance,
   as he went through the gate! Godly sorrow is a blessed grief! Let no
   man speak evil of it. "Repent and be converted" is as

   much the Gospel as, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ," and it is not
   to be omitted in our preaching at the hazard of doing damage to men's
   souls!

   He who has experienced holy sorrow for sin will continue to feel it. I
   should wonder if he did not often pull up the sluices and let his soul
   flow in a flood of loving regret--

   "If tears of sorrow would suffice To pay the debt I owe, Tears should
   from both my weeping eyes In ceaseless torrents flow."

   A weeper in that sense, always repenting, is, also, always growing in
   Grace! So this place Bochim looks extremely hopeful, does it not?

   II. Now let me turn to the other side and show you that there was
   nothing permanently good in Bochim's sudden water floods. These people
   were made weepers through hearing the Angel's sermon, but their weeping
   was VERY DISAPPOINTING. I half suspect that their tears and
   lamentations were produced as much by the Preacher's Person as by
   anything else. It was the Angel of the Lord and who would not be moved
   at His Presence? God gifts certain speakers with the power of moving
   the natural feelings and that gift abundantly rested upon the Covenant
   Messenger. Some men so preach that it were almost impossible to remain
   unsoftened. There is a pathos about them, or there is an earnestness so
   intense, so manifest, that for the heart of the hearer to be touched is
   a natural consequence!

   Now, I dread lest any of you should be so moved by me, when I preach,
   that your feeling should arise from my tone or mannerism, or because
   you have an affection or esteem for me--for be sure of this--that which
   comes to you from a man will come to an end before long! A temporary
   cause cannot produce an everlasting change! "You must be born again,"
   not of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but by the Spirit of God!
   Everything about the preacher's choice words, or musical tone, though
   proper enough as an accessory--if it becomes the principle and the
   power that moves you--will end in failure! That which begins with wind
   will end with whirlwind! That which comes of words will evaporate in
   words, by-and-by.

   It may be a great blessing to you to hear a very useful preacher, but
   if you depend upon him in the least, it will be mischievous to you. Go
   and hear the Gospel from any of my Master's servants and never depend,
   in the least, upon any one man, whoever he may be! Seek that your
   repentance may be a repentance which is worked by the Spirit of God in
   your heart and conscience, for if it is not so, it will, one day,
   curdle into greater depravity! Sham religion is an injury rather than a
   benefit. I suggest to you that you ask your heart many a question and
   catechize it after the manner of Bed-dome's hymn--

   "Why, O my Soul! Why do you weep? Tell me from where arise Those briny
   tears that often flow, Those groans that pierce the skies! Is sin the
   cause of your complaint, Or the chastising rod? Do you an evil heart
   lament, And mourn an absent God? Lord, let me weep for nothing but sin,
   And after none but Thee. And then I would--oh, that I might A constant
   weeper be."

   Again, I am afraid that the repentance of these people had a great deal
   to do with their natural softness. They were tender and excitable
   because there was little grit in their nature--their manliness was of a
   degenerate type. They feared to go to battle for God--they dreaded the
   noise and the slaughter. They were, moreover, easily moved by their
   fellow men, and took shape from those who lived near them. They went to
   worship Baal because their neighbors said, "Come and worship Baal." And
   they worshipped Ashtaroth because their friends said, "Come, let us
   reverence the goddess." They were malleable, pliable, ductile.

   We have numbers around us of that kind. What shall I call them--men of
   wax? Creatures of India rubber? They go to be shaped, even, by your
   finger, like clay upon the potter's wheel, not yet hardened in the
   fire. No one knows what

   their shape will be when they leave the wheel. Some have been here for
   many years and have often been moved and molded by the preacher--and
   yet they are not saved! While stout-hearted rebels have stood in the
   aisles with half a sneer and God has brought the hammer down upon their
   flinty hearts, broken them to pieces--and now they are saved by mighty
   Grace and rejoice in the Lord! Some have a natural tenderness which
   hinders the attainment of spiritual softness. Now, mark you, that which
   is natural may be used by God towards that which is spiritual, but
   still it is not, in itself, spiritual!

   All that readiness to cry, all that readiness to receive the Word of
   God with joy and to leap at once into faith may be nothing but mental
   weakness. Some men weep profusely because they have been drunk and that
   gives them a drop in their eye--this is a miserable business! I like
   the strong man who cries within and is weary of the visible rain
   showers. I know really tender-hearted men who could not shed a tear for
   their lives, but feel a far deeper anguish than those whose griefs are
   shallow and watery. It is very beautiful to talk of the tears streaming
   down their faces, but many converts have never shed a tear and,
   perhaps, never will. But this does not prove that they are not
   converted--far from it--the tear is but a natural drop of moisture and
   soon evaporates! The better thing is the inward torrent of grief within
   the soul which leaves an indelible mark within. You know how we sang
   just now--

   "Tears, though flowing like a river, Never can one sin erase; Jesus'
   tears would not avail you, Blood, alone, can meet your case; Fly to
   Jesus!

   Life is found in His embrace."

   One grain of faith is better than a gallon of tears. A drop of genuine
   repentance is more precious than a torrent of weeping.

   There is another thing about the weeping of these people and that is
   that it was caused a great deal by threats of punishment. I am afraid
   that they did not weep because they sinned, but they wept because God
   said that He would not drive out any more Canaanites. They wished to
   conquer more of them--more of the most disreputable sort--but they did
   not wish to drive them all out. Yet they mourned because those whom
   they had spared would now get the upper hand! The more comfortable sort
   of Canaanites they were willing to save, but when they found that they
   were to have them for thorns in their sides--then they brought out
   their handkerchiefs--for there was reason for selfish grief.

   Yes, and you may preach the fires of Hell till men are willing to
   abandon darling lusts of the more glaring sort. To such we would put
   searching questions. Is there any holy salt in your tears? Is it sin
   that you weep for? Is it sin that you repent of? Every murderer repents
   at the gallows, they say--that is, he repents of being hanged, but he
   does not repent of having killed others. He might do the same thing
   again if he had the opportunity. We ought clearly to discern between
   the natural terrors that come of vivid descriptions of the wrath to
   come and that real spiritual touch of God, the Holy Spirit, which
   breaks and melts the heart and then casts it into another mold.

   These people were deceived as to the depth and sincerity of their own
   feelings. Doubtless they reckoned themselves choice penitents when they
   were only cowardly tremblers, laboring under impressions which were as
   useless as they were transient! Their feeling was but as a meteor's
   blaze, shedding strong but momentary light--

   "What sadder scenes can angels view Than self-deceiving tears? They
   give you hope, a hope untrue, Then deepen al your fears."

   We are quite sure that these people, though they wept, were none the
   better for it, because if they had been, they would have cried, "Come,
   Brothers, get your swords! Let us go and fight these Hivites and
   Hittites and cast down their altars, and sweep away their images and
   groves." No, they kept their idle swords in their scabbards and made
   treaties with the condemned races! They used not their axes to cut down
   the false gods, but they said, "Let us have respect to the religion of
   others. There is no doubt that their idolatry is wrong--in fact, their
   practices are questionable and we are very sorry for it--but we need
   not interfere, nor execute Jehovah's sentence with a bare literalness."

   In addition, they very likely confessed and deplored their own laxity
   and went the length of saying, "It is very grievous that we should be
   so obstinate. It is really a dreadful thing." I heard one say, "It is
   an awful thing to be a slave to the wine cup. I wish that I had never
   tasted it. The first opportunity I get, I will turn over a new leaf."
   He did not say what

   the new leaf would be, but he was going to do any quantity of reforming
   work. Alas, he never did anything at all, for he was drunk, again, the
   next day! A beautiful penitent to look upon, but a wretched hypocrite
   in due time, for he returned, like the dog, to his vomit, and the sow
   which was washed to her wallowing in the mire. If you repent of sin,
   down with sin! In God's name, down with sin! When repentance is hearty
   it is practical. When a man truly turns to God, he turns away from sin.
   If Satan is effectually driven out of a man, the emancipated one sweeps
   his house and purges himself of the filth which he formerly harbored.
   He plucks out right-eye lusts and cuts off right-arm sins, for he feels
   that he can no longer transgress against his God.

   Next, these people had not repented, for they did not bring their
   children up rightly. The next generation, it is said, knew not the
   Lord, neither the mighty works of the Lord. That was because their
   parents did not teach them. Not that parents can teach children so that
   they know the Lord in their hearts, but God has so put it--"Train up a
   child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart
   from it." That is the great general rule of God's moral government. If
   parents make known the things of God to their children, it cannot be
   said that the children do not know the works of God. If parents teach
   with affectionate earnestness, their children learn, at least, the
   letter of the Truth of God. I do not believe in your repentance for sin
   if you tolerate your child's living in it! I cannot believe that you
   know the Lord unless you long for your offspring to know Him!

   A man says, "Oh, it is an evil thing, but, you know, young people will
   have their own way and we must not be too strict." Sorrowfully do we
   foresee what will become of young people who have parents that do not
   love them enough to restrain them from doing evil! Well may you weep,
   for you are murdering the souls of your own flesh and blood! Woe unto
   you, with all your tears, if you have no regard for your household and
   no care to bring up your children in the fear of God! I know that these
   people did not repent aright because they went from bad to worse. They
   went from weeping before God to worshipping Baal--like some I have
   heard of who are found crying in the House of God on Sunday night--and
   are laughing at the theater on Monday night!

   O base hypocrites! Penitents-at a dance! Broken-hearted sinners on
   Sunday, crying, "Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners," and
   whole-hearted drunkards before the week is up, yelling, "We won't go
   home till morning!" Look at the miserable sinners! See what they are
   at! Are these your weepers? These your men of tender conscience? Their
   Bochim is all a lie--a mere pretense! The more tender you are, if
   afterwards you harden yourselves, so much the greater will be your
   guilt. And if you humble yourselves before God in mere appearance, so
   much the more terrible will be your doom if that humbleness departs and
   you go back to the sin from which you professed to turn! I know that
   these people were not penitents because God did not take away the
   chastisement. The punishment which He threatened, He brought upon them.
   He gave them over to the spoilers and sold them to their enemies. But
   where there is a hearty repentance of sin, God will never lay
   punishment on a man. He will forgive him and receive him to His bosom
   and restore him.

   To sum up, in a word, all that I have said, salvation lies not in
   feeling, but in believing! Salvation lies not in weeping, but in
   trusting in Christ! Repentance is not to be measured by outward
   manifestations of sorrow. The Prophet says, "Rend your heart and not
   your garments." Let your hearts be torn away from sin and from
   everything that leads to sin--and then shall you weep acceptably before
   God! The Lord bless this word to those it is meant for. I do not know
   who they are, but He does. And may He send His blessing by His Holy
   Spirit. Amen.

Shutting, Sealing and Covering--or, Messiah's Glorious Work

   (No. 1681)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 24, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   Seventy weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city,
   to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
   reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness,
   and to seal up the vision andprophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy."

   Daniel 9:24.

   The Lord God appointed a set time for the coming of His Son into the
   world. Nothing was left to chance. Infinite Wisdom dictated the hour at
   which the Messiah should be born and the moment at which He should be
   cut off. His advent and His work are the highest point of the purpose
   of God, the hinge of history, the center of Providence, the crowning of
   the edifice of Grace and, therefore, peculiar care watched over every
   detail. Once in the history of the world has the Son of God appeared to
   put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself and this is the event before
   which all other events must bow. The studious mind will be delighted to
   search out the reasons why the Messiah came not before and why He did
   not tarry till yet later ages. Prophecies declared the date, but long
   before, Infallible Wisdom had settled it for the most profound reasons.
   It was well that the Redeemer came--it was well that He came in what
   Scripture calls the fullness of time, even in these last days.

   Note, again, that the Lord told His people somewhat darkly, but still,
   with a fair measure of clearness, when the Christ would come. Thus He
   cheered them when the heavy clouds of woe hung over their path. This
   prophecy shone like a star in the midst of the sorrow of Israel! So
   bright was it, that at the period when Christ came, there was a general
   expectation of Him! Holy men and women, diligent in the study of the
   Scriptures, were waiting for Him--Simeon was waiting for the
   consolation of Israel--and Anna looked for redemption in Jerusalem with
   others of like mind. Not only the Jews, but the Samaritans expected
   Him, for the woman at the well exclaimed, "I know that the Messiah
   comes, which is called Christ."

   Even in heathen lands there was remarkable cessation from stir and
   battle; an unusual peace reigned over all the nations and the hush of
   expectation ruled the hour--

   No war, or battle's sound,

   Was heard the world around--

   The idle spear and shield were high up hung;

   The hooked chariot stood

   Unstained with hostile blood;

   The trumpet spoke not to the armed throng;

   And kings sat still with awful eye,

   As if they surely knew their So vereign Lord was by. Men were looking
   out for the coming One, for the corn of earth was ripe for the reaper.
   Men were on the tiptoe of expectation and wondered when the promised
   Prince would arrive. Alas, they knew Him not when He appeared! After
   this fashion are things at the present moment with regard to the Second
   Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. "Of that day and of that hour knows no
   man," but it is known unto God and fixed in the roll of His eternal
   purposes. "Known unto God are all His works from the creation of the
   world," and especially those grand works which concern the Person of
   our adorable Lord Jesus.

   He shall come as God has appointed--the vision of His Glory shall not
   tarry. He has given us suggestive hints as to that glorious appearing
   and He has plainly taught us to be looking for and listening unto the
   Day of the Lord. Among His last words are these, "Surely I come
   quickly"--these are words of consolation as well of warning. He bids us
   watch constantly for the coming of the Lord--that it overtake us not as
   a thief in the night. And He assures us that He will descend from
   Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trumpet of
   God. Therefore comfort one another

   with the glad tidings and whenever your hearts sicken because of
   abounding sin, hear with the ear of faith the voice of promise crying,
   "Behold, the Bridegroom comes." Rest assured that He comes who will, in
   the fullest and most manifest sense, finish transgression and make an
   end of sin--and bring in everlasting righteousness.

   The advent of the Well-Beloved is the consolation of His mourning
   saints. Both at His first and second appearing the Lord not only comes
   to drive away the wicked as chaff, but also to comfort and exalt His
   elect--it is a day that shall burn as an oven and yet, to the redeemed,
   it will be the happiest day that ever dawned! The First Advent of our
   Lord is spoken of, in our text, as ordained to be before the 70 weeks
   were finished and the city should be destroyed. And so it was, even as
   the Prophet had spoken. I shall not occupy your time by attempting to
   fix the beginning and the end of the period intended by the 70 weeks
   and the seven weeks and three-score and two weeks. That is a deep
   study, requiring much research and learning, and I conceive that the
   discussion of such a subject would be of no great practical use to us
   this Sabbath morning.

   You will be better nourished upon the Lord, Himself, than upon times
   and seasons. Suffice it to believe that Jesus Christ our Lord, the
   Messiah, came exactly as it was prophesied and remained on earth as it
   was foretold He should do. In the middle of the predestined week He was
   cut off, when He had completed three and a half years of saving
   ministry. And within another period of like length, the Gospel was
   preached throughout all nations and Messiah's peculiar relation to
   Israel was cut off. At another time it may afford you profitable
   contemplation if you consider the 490 years from the decree of the king
   for rebuilding to the overthrow of Jerusalem.

   We will, at this present hour, survey the work of the Messiah--that is
   His Hebrew name, or of Christ, which is the Greek interpretation
   thereof. Let us survey the work of the Anointed. Secondly, let us
   inquire as to our participation in it. And then, thirdly, let us
   contemplate the consequences which follow upon us being sharers in it,
   or upon our not being participants in it. Oh for a measure of the
   anointing, that we may fitly meditate upon our great theme! Come, Holy
   Spirit and rest upon us!

   I. First, let us survey the Messiah's work. According to my text, it
   divides itself into two grand works, which two works subdivide
   themselves, in each case, into three particulars. The first work of our
   Lord Jesus Christ is the overthrow of evil and it is thus described--
   "To finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
   reconciliation for iniquity." But our Lord's labor is not all spent
   upon pulling-down work! He comes to build up and His second work is the
   setting up of righteousness in the world, described, again, by three
   sentences--"To bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the
   vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy."

   The first work of the Messiah is the overthrow of evil. This overthrow
   of evil is described by three words. If I were to give you a literal
   translation from the Hebrew, I might read the passage thus--"To shut up
   the transgression, to seal up sin and to cover up iniquity." According
   to learned men, those are the words which are here used and the three
   put together are a singularly complete description of the putting away
   of sin. First, it is shut up. It is, as it were, taken prisoner and
   confined in a cell. The door is fastened and it is held in durance--it
   is out of sight; held to a narrow range--unable to exercise the power
   it once possessed. In a word, it is "restrained"--so the margin of our
   Bibles reads it.

   The Hebrew word signifies to hold back, to hold in, to arrest, to keep
   in prison, to shut in or shut up. Its dominion is finished, for sin,
   itself, is bound. Christ has led captivity captive. But it is not
   enough to shut up the vanquished tyrant, unless he is shut up forever
   and, therefore, lest there should be any possibility of his breaking
   loose, again, the next sentence is, "To seal up." The uses of the seal
   are many, but here it is employed for certainty of custody. Just as
   when Daniel was thrown into the lions' den, the king sealed the stone
   with his own signet and with the signet of his lords. Or, better still,
   as when our Divine Master was laid in the grave, they rolled the stone
   to the mouth of the sepulcher and His enemies set a seal and a watch,
   lest His body should be stolen by His disciples.

   In His case--

   "Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,

   Christ has burst the gates of Hell." But sin cannot thus arise. It is
   imprisoned in the sepulcher of Jesus and it can never come forth, for
   the royal seal of the Immutable God is set upon the door. Thus is sin
   placed doubly out of sight--it is shut up and sealed up--as a document
   put into a case and then sealed. "Finished," and, "made an end of," are
   the two words used in our authorized version, and they give the essence
   of the meaning. To borrow a figure from current events--Arabi, the
   Egyptian rebel, is shut up

   as our prisoner and his defeat is sealed, therefore his rebellion is
   finished and an end made of it. Even thus is it with transgression--our
   Lord has vanquished evil and certified the same under the hand and seal
   of the Omnipotent--and, therefore, we may with rapture hear Him say,
   "It is finished," and also behold Him rise from the dead to seal our
   justification!

   Yet, as if this might not suffice, the next term in the Hebrew is, "to
   cover up," for the word to make reconciliation or expiation is usually,
   in the Hebrew, to cover over. "Blessed is the man whose transgression
   is forgiven, whose sin is covered." Christ has come to cover sin, to
   atone for it and so to hide it. His glorious merits and substitutionary
   sufferings and death put away sin so completely that God, Himself,
   beholds it no more. He has blotted it out, cast it into the sea and
   removed it from us as far as the east is from the west! The two former
   sentences speak of finishing transgression and making an end of
   sin--and these expressions are full and complete--while this third one
   explains the means by which the work is done, namely, by an expiation
   which covers up every trace of sin.

   Thus in the three, together, we have a picture of the utter extinction
   of sin, both as to its guilt and its power, yes, and its very
   existence! It is put into the dungeon and the door is shut; after this
   the door is sealed and then it is covered up, so that the place of
   sin's sepulcher cannot be seen anymore forever! Sin was, aforetime, in
   God's sight, but through Christ Jesus we read, "You have forgiven the
   iniquity of Your people; You have covered all their sin; You have taken
   away all Your wrath." Sin was in God's way till Christ shut it up and
   now it pushes itself no more into the sight of the Lord. Sin was always
   breaking loose till Jesus sealed it up, but now it cannot come forth to
   lay any accusation against the justified.

   The three words might be put into one word by saying Christ has made a
   clean sweep of sin of every kind. Whatever may be its special
   development, whether it is transgression, which means the breaking of
   bounds. Or sin, which is any lack of conformity to the Law. Or
   iniquity--that is to say, inequity, or the lack of equity, a default in
   righteousness. In all forms in which it can be described--Christ has
   shut it up, sealed it up and covered it up by His atoning Sacrifice,
   once and for all! The depths have covered it. If it is searched for, it
   cannot be found! Our blessed Scapegoat has carried it away into the
   land of forgetfulness--it shall not be mentioned against us anymore
   forever. Those three words contain infinitely more of meaning than I
   have either space or ability to set forth.

   Observe, dear Friends, that the terms for sin are left in an absolute
   form. It is said, "to finish transgression," "to make an end of sins,"
   "to make reconciliation for iniquity." Whose transgression is this?
   Whose sins are these? Whose iniquity is it? It is not said. There is no
   word employed to set out the persons for whom Atonement is made, as is
   done in verses like these--"Christ loved the Church and gave Himself
   for it." "I lay down My life for the sheep." The mass of evil is left
   unlabeled so that any penitent sinner may look to the Messiah and find
   in Him the Remover of sin! What transgression is finished?
   Transgression of every kind! But what sins are made an end of? Sins of
   every sort--against Law and against Gospel, against God and against
   men--sins past, sins present, sins to come! And what iniquity is
   expiated? Every form of iniquity, whatever falls short by omission,
   whatever goes beyond by commission!

   Christ, in this passage, is spoken of in general terms as removing
   sins, transgressions and iniquities in the mass. In other places we
   read of the objects of His Substitution, but here all is left
   indefinite to encourage all! He gives us no catalog of offenses--for
   where should He write it? The very heavens could not hold the
   enumeration! He takes the whole, unformed, horrible, black, disgusting
   mass and this is what He does with it--He encloses it, fastens it up
   and buries it forever! In the words of our version, He finishes it,
   makes an end of it and makes expiation for it. The Messiah came to wipe
   out and utterly destroy sin and this is, and will be, the effect of His
   work! Put all the three sentences into one and this is the sum of them.

   Indulge me for a few minutes while I take the sentences separately and
   press each cluster by itself. And first notice that it is said He came
   to finish the transgression. As some understand it, our Lord came, that
   in His death, transgression might reach its highest development and
   sign its own condemnation. Sin reached its finish, its ultimatum, its
   climax, in the murder of the Son of God! It could not proceed
   further--the course of malice could go no further. They had stoned the
   Prophets and killed everyone that was sent to them. But now He came and
   God said, "They will reverence My Son," but they did not. On the other
   hand, they cried, "This is the heir! Let us kill Him and the
   inheritance shall be ours." Sin finished itself when it brought forth
   the death of the Son of God. It could produce no riper fruit, for no
   supposable crime can exceed the putting to death of Jesus our Lord.

   Now has sin finished itself and now has Jesus come to finish it. "Thus
   far," He says, "you shall go, but no further: here in My wounds and
   death shall your proud waves be stopped." Sin virtually committed
   suicide when it slew the Savior, for His death became its death! The
   kingdom of sin was overthrown in that day when it smote the Prince of
   Peace! Then was a period put to the dominion of evil and, to come back
   to the Hebrew, the Lord restrained transgression and Satan was bound
   with a great chain. "The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
   commands all men everywhere to repent." Sin may no longer range
   unchecked! Sin is now arrested and held under warrant, restrained under
   the bonds of Law and, from the day of our Lord, by the preaching of the
   Gospel, sin has become more and more shut up as to its reigning power.

   Some men have been altogether delivered from the rule of evil and other
   men, who remain its slaves, yet go not to such a pitch of outward riot
   as they would have done had not Christ appeared. Sin is being besieged!
   It skulks behind its earthworks. Its sorties are becoming fewer and
   less forcible. And though it is still powerful, the hour of its pride
   is passed, its head has received a deadly wound--the age has come in
   which the victory of truth and righteousness is guaranteed by the death
   of Jesus Christ our Lord! Your finis is written, O Transgression!
   Written by the pierced hands! Your huge volume has in it writing long
   enough and grievous enough, full enough of blasphemy against God and of
   evil towards men, but now the Lord Jesus takes the pen from you and you
   shall write no more as you have done. The huge leviathan of evil has
   met its match and is placed under the power of the Avenger.

   Thus says the Lord, "Behold, I will put My hook in your nose and My
   bridle in your lips, and I will turn you by the way by which you came."
   The Lord has set bounds to the transgression which aforetime broke all
   bounds! Where sin abounded, Grace does much more abound! Sin is shut up
   that Grace may have liberty. This is one part of our Lord's great
   work--all Glory be unto His name--He has accomplished it with power and
   the power of the enemy is broken!

   Now take the second sentence, which, in our version is, "To make an end
   of sin." Messiah has come to proclaim so free, so rich, so gracious a
   pardon to the sons of men that when they receive it, sin virtually
   ceases to be--it is made an end of. The man that is in Christ and has
   Christ for His covenant Head, is, this day so delivered from all sin
   that he may boldly ask the question, "Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect?" If Christ has made an end of sin, that is the
   end of it--the matter is ended and no more is to be said!

   Down among the dead, men let sin lie, forever buried by the right hand
   of the conquering Savior. But the Hebrew has it, "to seal up sins."
   Now, I take it to mean just this. There are certain handwritings which
   are against us and they would be produced against us in court. But by
   order of the Judge, all these handwritings are sealed up and regarded
   as out of sight--no man dare breaks the seal and no man can read them
   unless the seal is broken--therefore they will never be brought against
   us. They have become virtually null and void. Everything that can be
   brought as an accusation against God's people is now sealed up and put
   out of the way, once and for all, never to be opened and laid to their
   charge before the living God!

   Or, if you regard sin as a captive prisoner, you must now see that by
   Christ's death, the prison wherein sin lies is so sealed that the enemy
   can never come forth, again, in its ancient power. Sin could once sit
   on the highest mountain and look over the world and say, "All this is
   mine." And the embodiment of sin could come to Christ and say of all
   the kingdoms of the world, "All these will I give You," as though he
   claimed them all for his own. But it is not so today! The mountain of
   the Lord's house is, this day, exalted upon the top of the hills and
   though, as yet, all nations do not flow unto it, yet a glorious company
   comes streaming up to the Temple of the living God--and that company
   shall increase from day to day! As when a brooklet grows to a stream
   and the streamlet rises to a river, and the river swells till it rolls
   in fullest force into the shoreless main, so is it yet to be with the
   ever-growing Church of Jesus Christ, which, before long, shall carry
   all before it and cover the earth with blessing.

   Evil, you cannot reign! Jesus has come and overcome you, Himself, and
   taught man to vanquish you! You cannot come, again, to the crown you
   once had, for the Seed of the woman has broken your head! He shall
   reign forever and ever and you shall die! Hallelujah! The coffin of sin
   is both shut up and fastened down with the seal of Christ's victory!
   But now, the last expression is in English. He has come "to make
   reconciliation for iniquity," that is, to end the strife between God
   and man by a glorious reconciliation--a making, again, of peace between
   these two--so that God loves man and, as a consequence, man loves God.
   In the blessed Atonement of Christ, God and man meet at a chosen
   meeting place. Christ is Jehovah's darling and our delight. A slain
   Savior is well-pleasing to God and oh, how pleasing He is to a sinner

   who is deeply under a sense of sin! Here, here is that Mercy Seat
   sprinkled with blood where man may speak to God without fear--and where
   God does speak to man without wrath! Here Righteousness and Peace have
   met together! Mercy and Truth have kissed each other! Oh, glorious
   reconciliation which Christ has made by honoring the Law in His life
   and in His death!

   Now, take the Hebrew for it, and read the sentence thus--to cover
   iniquity. Oh, what bliss this is! To think, dear Friends, that sin is
   now, once and for all, covered! Not as though it lay rankling there
   beneath some coverlet through which fire might burn, or lightning
   strike, but Christ's covering is such that, if you could heap Hell over
   sin, it were not so hidden! And if you could pile worlds upon it, were
   not so concealed! And if all Heaven bowed to overlay it, it were not so
   out of sight as when Jesus buried it deeper than the lowest depths,
   where no memory can remember it, or mind perceive

   it!--

   "Our guilt shall vanish quite a way Though black as Hell before, Shall
   be dissolved beneath the sea, And shall be found no more."

   This is what is to be done with the whole kingdom of evil, as well with
   the power of it and with the guilt of it. Dagon is to fall and to be
   broken--and the very stump of him is to be demolished. As when the
   darkness flies before the sun, not a trace of its blackness is left, so
   is sin to be utterly destroyed from the redeemed of the Lord! It is not
   merely the guilt of sin that is shut up and sealed and covered, but sin
   itself, its power, its dominion, its habit, its defilement--the dread
   that comes of it and the fear and the burning of heart which it
   engenders. All the foul birds of sin's filthy cage must fly away, never
   to return, chased away by the glorious work of Him who shall save His
   people from their sins! For this the Messiah was cut off, and this, by
   His death, is achieved--

   "O love! You bottomless abyss!

   My sins are swallowed up in thee;

   Covered is my unrighteousness,

   Nor spot of guilt remains on me.

   While Jesus' blood, through earth and skies,

   Mercy, free, boundless mercy cries!"

   I fail to describe this triumphant overthrow of sin and Satan. I have
   neither wisdom nor language answerable to such a theme. I invite you,
   now, for a few minutes to consider the second work, namely, the setting
   up of righteousness. This is set before us in three expressions--first,
   in the words, "to bring in everlasting righteousness." And what is
   that? Why, His own righteousness which is from everlasting to
   everlasting and will never be taken way from those who have it and will
   never cease to be their beauty and their glorious Jesus! The work of
   Christ in His life and death is, by God, imputed to His people--indeed,
   it is theirs because they are one with Christ! He is the Lord, their
   righteousness, and they are the righteousness of God in Him. Saints are
   so righteous in Jesus Christ that they are more righteous than Adam was
   before he fell, for he had but a creature righteousness, but they have
   the righteousness of the Creator--Adam had a righteousness which he
   lost--but Believers have a righteousness which they can never lose, an
   everlasting righteousness!

   Nor is that all the meaning of our text--those to whom God imputes
   righteousness, to them, also, He imparts righteousness. He makes them
   pure in heart. He changes their desires. He makes them love that which
   is right and just and good and so He gives them Grace to lead godly,
   sober, honest and holy lives! This righteousness shall not be crushed
   out of them, for the work of the Spirit shall continue until they shall
   become perfect and be meet to dwell with God in His Light. Happy are
   those spirits to whom Christ gives an everlasting righteousness, for
   theirs is the Kingdom of God and in it they shall shine forth as the
   sun! They are right and they shall be right! They are true and they
   shall never degenerate into falsehood! They are God's own children and
   they shall go on to develop the image of Christ, their elder Brother,
   till they shall be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing! This
   Christ came to do--He imputes and imparts righteousness and thus brings
   in everlasting righteousness as the foundation of His Kingdom.

   Next, in order to the setting up of a Kingdom of righteousness, He is
   come that He may, "seal up vision and prophecy." That is, by fulfilling
   all the visions and the prophecies of the Old Testament in Himself, He
   ends both prophecy and vision. He seals up visions and prophecies so
   that they shall no more be seen or spoken. They are closed and no man
   can add to them and, therefore--and that is the point to note--the
   Gospel is forever settled, to remain eternally the same!

   Christ has set up a Kingdom that shall never be moved. His Truth can
   never be changed by any novel revelation. If any man comes to you and
   says, "I am a Prophet!" bid him go and find believers among the
   foolish, for, to you, Jesus has sealed up prophecy and vision and there
   is to be no more of it. There is no need of it, because in Christ, God
   has spoken all He means to say concerning the way of salvation. Until
   such time as Christ Himself shall come, the canon is complete, and
   though there are many voices crying, "Lo, here!" and, "Lo, there!" and
   some so fascinating that they might deceive, if it were possible, the
   very elect, yet those whom Christ has chosen know the Shepherd's voice
   and, "a stranger they will not follow, for they know not the voice of
   strangers."

   Brothers and Sisters, there was always something better yet to come in
   all times till Christ arrived, but after the best, there comes none. A
   certain philosopher taught this; the next philosopher taught that and
   the next one contradicted this and that and taught another thing--while
   another master arose and contradicted all who went before. So man
   groped, as in the dark, for the wall, but now, the day has dawned and
   the true Light of God shines, for Christ has appeared! This, then, is
   an essential part of the setting up of that which is good--namely, to
   settle truth on a fixed basis whereon we may stand steadfast and
   immovable. The candles are snuffed out because the day, itself, looks
   out from the windows of Heaven. Rejoice in this, Beloved! God makes you
   righteous in Christ and with Christ, and in order that you shall never
   be perplexed with change, He sets aside all other teachers, that Christ
   may be your All in All!

   Then, as if this were not enough, and truly it would not be enough, He
   is also come to anoint the Most Holy, or the Holy of Holies, as you may
   read it. And what doe this means? Nothing material, for the Holy of
   Holies, the place into which the High Priest went of old, is
   demolished, and the veil is torn in two. The Most Holy place is now the
   Person of the Lord Jesus Christ! He was anointed that God might dwell
   in Him. Together with Christ, the Holy of Holies is now His Church and
   that Church was anointed or dedicated when the Holy Spirit fell at
   Pentecost, to be with us and to abide in us forever. That was a noble
   part of the setting up of the great Kingdom of Righteousness, when
   tongues of fire descended and sat upon each of the disciples and they
   began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.

   This is Christ's work, for which He came and for which He ascended on
   high, to set up the Truth of God, to set up righteousness and to make
   it everlasting by the dwelling of the Holy Spirit in the Church of God
   in the midst of the sons of men. Thus you see, in six ways, which
   condense themselves into two, our Lord set about His lordly enterprise.
   Heaven rings with the praises of the Messiah who came to destroy the
   work of sin and to set up the Kingdom of Righteousness in the midst of
   the world!

   II. Let us now inquire as to our participation in these two works. I
   will put a few questions as briefly as I can, and I pray God, the Holy
   Spirit, that every one of us may honestly answer them. First, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, Christ has come into the world to do all this
   good work, but has He done it for us? "God so loved the world, that He
   gave His only begotten Son." What for? "That whoever believes in Him
   might not perish." There is a general aspect to the Atonement, but
   there is quite as surely a special objective in it. God loved the world
   and, therefore, He gave His Son. But to what end did He give His Son?
   Here is the answer, "That whoever believes in Him might not perish, but
   have everlasting life."

   There was a special eye to Believers. Come, then, have you believed?
   The first question that is to help you to answer that inquiry is
   this--Is your sin shut up as to its power? "Sin shall not have dominion
   over you" if Christ is in you. How is it between your soul and evil? Is
   there war, or peace? Once you loved sin--you could not have enough of
   it. Is it so now? Do you still delight in evil? For if you do, the love
   of God is not in you! Can you still put forth your hand to iniquity as
   you once did? Then do not pretend that Christ has done anything for
   you! If you are a Believer, your sin may not be absolutely dead, but it
   is shut up for dead--it is held fast in the condemned cell. It may
   still breathe, but it is crucified with Christ!

   How it tugs to get its hands loose from the nails! How it struggles to
   get its feet down from the tree! But it cannot, for He that nailed it
   there knew how to drive nails and how to fasten the offender to the
   tree. Do you begin to grow weary of iniquity? Is it distasteful and
   unpleasant to you? And, when looking over the day, you perceive where
   you have spoken unadvisedly or acted hastily, or in any other way
   soiled your character--do you feel as if you would gladly wash out
   every spot with tears? If it is so, Christ has begun with you--He has
   come to shut up your sin and to end its reign-- it shall no more have
   dominion over you. It may be in you, but it shall not be on the throne!
   It may threaten you, but it shall not command you! It may grieve you,
   but it shall not destroy you! You are under another Master--you serve
   the Lord Christ. Judge for yourself how this matter fares with you.

   The next question arising out of the text is, Is your sin sealed up as
   to its condemning power? Have you ever felt the power of the Holy
   Spirit in your soul, saying to you, "Go in peace; your sins, which are
   many, are all forgiven you"? Have you clutched that promise, "He that
   believes in Him is not condemned"? Have you believed in Jesus? Has that
   blessed Word of God, "There is therefore now no condemnation," breathed
   a deep calm over your spirit? Some of you do not know what I mean, but
   others of you do. Oh, what bliss, what a Heaven it is to know, "I am
   washed in the blood of the Lamb! I am delivered, clean delivered from
   every sin--past, present and to come--as to any possibility of its
   being laid to my charge! Christ has put my sins into a bag, sealed them
   up, hurled that bag into the sea and flung them out of existence! They
   are gone, never to be found again, ever!"

   He has made an end of sin. Come, dear Hearer, do you know anything
   about this? If you do not, it is the one thing you need to know and,
   until you know it, you will never have any rest to your spirit, but you
   will be tossed to and fro as upon a raging sea. "There is no peace,
   says my God, to the wicked." There is no peace to any of us till Christ
   has made an end of our sin! How is it with your hearts? And next, is
   your sin covered as to its appearance before God? Has the Lord Jesus
   Christ made such an expiation for your sin that it no longer glares in
   the Presence of the Most High, but you can come unto God without dread?
   Can you hopefully say, "Lord God, You see no sin in me, for You have
   covered me with the righteousness of Christ and washed me in His
   blood"? Did you ever feel the sweetness of that? It is rapture! I can
   remember times when I have been driven to doubt whether it could be
   true, it seemed too good--and then again, when my faith has revived, I
   have said--"Good as it is, it is true, for it is like God to do these
   great marvels and to put away the sins of His people and cover them
   once and for all."

   Oh, then there has been a joy within my spirit not at all like the joy
   of harvest, or the joy of marriage, or the joy of a first-born child in
   the house. No! It is a joy like the bliss of angels, deep, unspeakable,
   mysterious, Divine! Have you ever felt it? You will feel it constantly
   if Christ comes to dwell with you! You will, then, be assured in your
   heart that He has made an end of your sin. Further, let me question you
   about the next point. Has the Lord Jesus Christ made you righteous? Do
   you Glory in His blood and righteousness and do you now seek after that
   which is pure and holy? "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for
   whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap." If we continue in sin,
   we shall perish in sin. He is saved who comes out from evil and seeks
   to live honestly, righteously, soberly after the manner of the godly
   and the saintly. Is it so with you? Is there a great and deep change in
   your spirit, so that you now love those good things which once you
   despised and ridiculed in others? Oh, if you cannot answer my poor
   questions, how will you stand before the Judgment Seat of God when He
   shall test you as with fire?

   Furthermore, are the prophecies and visions sealed up as to you? Are
   they fulfilled in you? When God declares that He will wash us and make
   us whiter than snow, is it so with you? When He declares that He will
   cleanse our blood, which has not yet been cleansed, is it so with you?
   When He says, "A new heart, also, will I give them, and a right spirit
   will I put within them: and I will write My Law upon their hearts"--is
   it so with you? Are you fishing about after empty dreams and fancies,
   or have you laid hold upon the old prophecies and the ancient visions
   and discovered the substance of them to be deeply worked in your very
   heart?

   Nor is this all--are you anointed to be most holy to the Lord? Are you
   set apart that you may serve Him? Has the Holy Spirit come upon you,
   giving you a desire to do good? Have you a wish to rescue the
   perishing, a longing to bring the wandering sheep back to the great
   Shepherd's fold? Is the Spirit of God so upon you, today, that you can
   truly say, "I am not my own; I am bought with a price"? Jesus, the
   Messiah, came to do all these things and if He has not done them to
   you, then He has not come to you--you are still a stranger, still far
   off from Him! Oh, may the Lord make you desperately unhappy till you
   come to Jesus! May you never know what quiet means till you find it at
   the pierced feet! From this hour may you breathe sighs and may every
   pulse be a new agony of spirit, till, at last, you can say, "Yes, the
   Messiah was cut off, and cut off for me, and all that He came to do He
   did for me, and I am a sharer and a partaker in it all."

   III. Lastly, we have but a brief interval in which to speak of the
   results of participating in all this. The results! I need a week to
   speak of them! They are, first of all, security. How can that man be
   lost whose transgression is finished and whose sin has ceased to be?
   What is there for him to dread on earth, in Heaven, or in Hell? If
   Christ has put away my sin, I cannot die! If Christ has washed away my
   guilt, I cannot be condemned! I am safe and may triumphantly sing--

   "More happy, but not more secure, The glorified spirits in Heaven!"

   Therefore, rejoice in this!

   And now, inasmuch as you are secure, you are also reconciled to God and
   made to delight in Him. God is your Friend and you are one of the
   friends of God! Rejoice in that hallowed friendship and live in the
   assurance of it! Now you have the anointing, do not doubt it! Christ
   has made it yours by His death. The Spirit of the Lord rests upon you;
   you are fit for service; set about it without further question. The
   anointing is upon you; you are most holy to the Lord; so let your life
   be wholly consecrated. Your heart ought to be, and shall be, by the
   Spirit's power, as holy as that innermost shrine into which no
   unauthorized foot ever intruded--into which only once in the year the
   High Priest went--and then not without blood. God dwells in you, and
   you in God! Oh, blessed consequences--you shall soon dwell with Him
   forever!

   But now, suppose when I put the question, you had to shake your head
   and say, "No, it is not so with me"? Then hear these few sentences. If
   the Messiah has not done this for you, then your sin will be finished
   in another way--sin, when it is finished, brings forth death. An awful
   death awaits you--death unto God, purity and joy. Woe, woe, to you!
   Death, on the pale horse pursues you, and will overtake you soon! Then
   will one woe be past, but another will follow it. If Christ has never
   made an end of your sin, then mark this, your sin will soon make an end
   of you and all your hopes, your pleasure, your boasts and your peace
   will perish! Oh, terrible end of all that is hopeful within you! You
   shall be a desolation forever and forever!

   Has Christ not reconciled you? Then mark this, your enmity will
   increase! There is no peace between God and you, now, but soon will the
   war begin in which He must conquer and you, never yielding, will
   continue forever more to hate God and to find in that hate your utmost
   torment, your fiercest Hell! Have you never had the righteousness of
   Christ brought in? Then mark this, your unrighteousness will last
   forever! One of these days God will say, "He that is unholy, let him be
   unholy, still: He that is filthy, let him be filthy, still." That will
   be the most awful thing that can ever happen to you! You have heard of
   the fable of Medusa's head--whoever looked upon it, when it was held
   up, was turned to sto-ne--and one day, Sinner, you shall look at
   Death--and it will petrify your character so that it shall be forever
   what it is when death came to you! Where death finds you, there
   judgment shall find you, and there eternity shall leave you! Oh,
   wretched Soul, to have nothing to do with the everlasting righteousness
   of Christ! Are not the prophecies fulfilled in you, the prophecies of
   mercy? Then listen! The prophecies of woe will be written large across
   your history. "The wicked shall be turned into Hell, with all the
   nations that forget God." Beware, you that forget God, lest He tear you
   in pieces and there be none to save you!

   I will not detain you with many such words of terror, but through the
   Old Testament they roll like peals of thunder, nor is the New Testament
   less stern towards him that goes on in his iniquity and will not turn
   to the Christ. Lastly, will you never be anointed to be most holy? Then
   remember, holiness and you will stand at a distance, forever--and to be
   far off from holiness must necessarily be to be far off from Heaven and
   happiness! Sin is misery. In it lies both the root and the fruit of
   eternal woe. Purity is paradise--to be right with God is to be right
   with yourself and all created things! But if you will not be holy, then
   you must, by force of your own choice, be forever tossed about upon the
   restless sea of wretchedness! God save you, Brothers and Sisters! God
   save you for Christ's sake! Amen.

Ask and Have

   (No. 1682)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 1, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You lust, and have not: you kill, and desire to have, and cannot
   obtain: you fight and war, yet you have not, because you ask not. You
   ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it
   upon your lusts." James 4:2,3.

   MAY these striking words be made profitable to us by the teaching of
   the Holy Spirit. Man is a creature abounding in needs and ever restless
   and, therefore, his heart is full of desires. I can hardly imagine a
   man existing who has not many desires of some kind or another. Man is
   comparable to the sea anemone with its multitude of tentacles which are
   always hunting in the water for food; or like certain plants which send
   out tendrils, seeking after the means of climbing. The poet says, "Man
   never is, but always wishes to be, blest." He steers for which he
   thinks to be his port, but, as yet, he is tossed about on the waves.
   One of these days he hopes to find his heart's delight and he continues
   to desire with more, or less, expectancy.

   This fact appertains both to the worst of men and the best of men. In
   bad men, desires corrupt into lusts--they long after that which is
   selfish, sensual and, consequently, evil. The current of their desires
   sets strongly in a wrong direction. These lusts, in many cases, become
   extremely intense--they make the man their slave. They domineer over
   his judgment; they stir him up to violence--he fights and wars--perhaps
   he literally kills. In God's sight, who counts anger, murder, he does
   kill often. Such is the strength of his desires that they are commonly
   called passions. And when these passions are fully excited, then the
   man, himself, struggles vehemently, so that the kingdom of the devil
   suffers violence and the violent take it by force!

   Meanwhile, in gracious men there are also desires. To rob the saints of
   their desires would be to injure them greatly, for by these they rise
   out of their lower selves. The desires of the gracious are after the
   best things--things pure and peaceable, laudable and elevating. They
   desire God's Glory and, therefore, their desires spring from higher
   motives than those which inflame the unrenewed mind. Such desires in
   Christian men are frequently very fervent and forcible. They ought
   always to be so. Those desires begotten of the Spirit of God stir the
   renewed nature, exciting and stimulating it, and making the man to
   groan and to be ill in anguish and in travail until he can attain that
   which God has taught him to long for. The lusting of the wicked and the
   holy desiring of the righteous have their own ways of seeking
   gratification. The lusting of the wicked develops itself in
   contention--it kills and desires to have its fights and it wars. While,
   on the other hand, the desire of the righteous, when rightly guided,
   betakes itself to a far hotter course for achieving its purpose, for it
   expresses itself in fervent and importunate prayer. The godly man, when
   full of desire, asks and receives at the hands of God.

   At this time, I shall, by God's help, try to set forth from our text,
   first, the poverty of lusting--"You lust and have not." Secondly, I
   shall sadly show the poverty of many professing Christians in spiritual
   things, especially in their Church capacity--they also long for and
   have not. Thirdly, we shall speak, in closing, upon the wealth with
   which holy desires will be rewarded if we will but use the right means.
   If we ask we shall receive.

   First, consider THE POVERTY OF LUSTING--"You lust, and have not."
   Carnal lusts, however strong they may be, do not, in many cases, obtain
   that which they seek after. As says the text, "You desire to have, and
   cannot obtain." The man longs to be happy, but he is not. He pines to
   be great, but he grows meaner every day. He aspires after this and
   after that which he thinks will content him, but he is still
   unsatisfied. He is like the troubled sea which cannot rest. One way or
   another, his life is disappointment. He labors as in the very fire, but
   the result is vanity and vexation of spirit. How can it be otherwise?
   If we sow the wind, must we not reap the whirlwind and nothing else?

   Or, if, perhaps, the strong lusts of an active, talented, persevering
   man do give him what he seeks after, yet how soon he loses it! He has
   it so that he has it not. The pursuit is toilsome, but the possession
   is a dream. He sits down to eat and lo! the feast is snatched away, the
   cup vanishes when it is at his lips! He wins to lose! He builds and his
   sandy foundation slips from under his tower and his efforts lie in
   ruins. He that conquered kingdoms, died discontented on a lone rock in
   mid ocean and he who revived his empire, fell never to rise again. As
   Jonah's gourd withered in a night, so have empires fallen on a sudden,
   and their lords have died in exile. What men obtain by warring and
   fighting is an estate with a short lease--the obtaining is so temporary
   that it still stands true, "they lust, and have not."

   Or if such men have gifts and power enough to retain that which they
   have won, yet in another sense they have it not while they have it, for
   the pleasure which they looked for in it is not there. They pluck the
   apple and it turns out to be one of those Dead Sea apples which crumble
   to ashes in the hand. The man is rich, but God takes away from him the
   power to enjoy his wealth. By his lusts and warring the licentious man,
   at last, obtains the objective of his cravings and, after a moment's
   gratification, he loathes that which he so passionately lusted for! He
   longs for the tempting pleasure, seizes it and crushes it by his eager
   grasp!

   Watch the boy hunting the butterfly which flits from flower to flower
   while he pursues it ardently. At last it is within reach and with his
   cap he knocks it down! But when he picks up the poor remains, he finds
   the painted fly spoiled by the act which won it! Thus may it be said of
   multitudes of the sons of men--"You lust, and have not." Their poverty
   is set forth in a threefold manner. "You kill, and desire to have, and
   cannot obtain," "You have not, because you ask not." "You ask, and
   receive not, because you ask amiss." If the lusters fail, it is not
   because they did not set to work to gain their ends, for, according to
   their nature, they used the most practical means within their reach and
   used them eagerly, too!

   According to the mind of the flesh, the only way to obtain a thing is
   to fight for it and James sets this down as the reason of all fighting.
   "Why come wars and fighting among you? Come they not, therefore, even
   of your lusts that war in your members?" This is the form of effort of
   which we read, "You fight and war, yet you have not." To this mode of
   operation men cling from age to age. If a man is to get along in this
   world, they tell me, he must contend with his neighbors, and push them
   from their vantage ground. He must not be particular how they are to
   thrive, but he must mind the main chance on his own account and take
   care to rise, no matter how many he may tread upon. He cannot expect to
   get on if he loves his neighbor as himself! It is a fair fight and
   every man must look to himself!

   Do you think I am satirical? I may be, but I have heard this sort of
   talk from men who meant it. So they take to fighting and that fighting
   is often victorious, for, according to the text, "you kill"--that is to
   say, they so fight that they overthrow their adversary and there is an
   end of him. They are men of great strength, young lions that can go
   forth and tear their prey to pieces and yet, it is said of them, that
   they "lack and suffer hunger." But they that wait upon the Lord shall
   not need any good thing, while these lusters are unrestrained in their
   efforts to gain their point! They stop at nothing, they kill and desire
   to have.

   Moreover, they fight with great perseverance, for the text says, "You
   fight and war." Now, war is a continuation of the act of fighting,
   prolonging it from campaign to campaign and conducting it by the rules
   of military art till the victory is won. Multitudes of men are living
   for themselves, competing here and warring there, fighting for their
   own hand with the utmost perseverance. They have little choice as to
   how they will do it. Conscience is not allowed to interfere in their
   transactions, but the old advice rings in their ears, "Get money! Get
   money honestly, if you can, but by any means get money." No matter
   though body and soul are ruined and others are deluged with
   misery--fight on--for there is no discharge in this war! If you are to
   win, you must fight--and everything is fair in war!

   So they muster their forces, they struggle with their fellows, they
   make the battle of life hotter and hotter, they banish love and brand
   tenderness as folly--and yet, with all their schemes, they obtain not
   the end of life in any true sense. Well says James, "You kill, and
   desire to have, and cannot obtain; you fight and war, yet you have
   not." When men who are greatly set upon their selfish purposes do not
   succeed, they may possibly hear that the reason of their non-success is
   "Because you ask not." Is, then, success to be achieved by asking? So
   the text seems to hint--and so the righteous find it. Why does not this
   man of intense desires take to asking? The reason is, first, because it
   is unnatural to the natural man to pray--as well expect him to fly!

   He despises the idea of supplication. "Pray?" he says. "No, I want to
   be at work. I cannot waste time on devotions; prayers are not
   practical. I want to fight my way. While you are praying, I shall have
   beaten my opponent. I go to my counting house and leave you to your
   Bibles and your prayers." He has no mind for asking of God. He declares
   that none but canting hypocrites care to pray, thus confessing that if
   he were to pray, he would be a canting hypocrite! As for him, his
   praying is of quite another sort, and woe to those who come into his
   clutches! They will find that with him, business is business, and
   pretty sharp business, too. He will never stoop to pray, He is too
   proud. God's reliance he does not understand--self-reliance is his
   word! Self is his god and to his god he looks for success!

   He is so proud that he reckons himself to be his own Providence! His
   own right hand and his active arm shall get him the victory. When he is
   very liberal in his views, he admits that though he does not pray, yet
   there may be some good in it, for it quiets people's minds and makes
   them more comfortable. But as to any answer ever coming from prayer, he
   laughs at the idea and talks both philosophically and theologically
   about the absurdity of supposing that God alters His course of conduct
   out of respect to the prayers of men and women. "Ridiculous," he says,
   "utterly ridiculous!" And, therefore, in his own great wisdom, he
   returns to his fighting and his warring, for by such means he hopes to
   attain his end. Yet he obtains not!

   The whole history of mankind shows the failure of evil lusts to obtain
   their objective. For a while the carnal man goes on fighting and
   warring, but, by-and-by, he changes his mind, for he is ill, or
   frightened. His purpose is the same, but if it cannot be achieved one
   way, he will try another. If he must ask, well, he will ask--he will
   become religious and do good to himself in that way. He finds that some
   religious people prosper in the world and that even sincere Christians
   are by no means fools in business and, therefore, he will try their
   plan. And now he comes under the third censure of our text--"You ask
   and receive not." What is the reason why the man who is the slave of
   his lusts obtains not his desire, even when he takes to asking?

   The reason is because his asking is a mere matter of form. His heart is
   not in his worship. He buys a book containing what are called, "forms
   of prayer," and he repeats these, for repeating is easier than praying
   and demands no thought! I have no objection to your using a form of
   prayer if you pray with it, but I know a great many who do not pray
   with it, but only repeat the form. Imagine what would come of our
   families if, instead of our children speaking to us frankly when they
   have any need, they were always to think it requisite to go into the
   library and hunt up a form of prayer and read it to us! Surely there
   would be an end to all home-feeling and love! Life would move in
   fetters! Our household would become a kind of boarding-school, or
   barracks--and all would be parade and formality--instead of happy eyes
   looking up with loving trust into fond eyes that delight to respond!

   Many spiritual men use a form, but carnal men are pretty sure to do so,
   for they end in the form. This man's prayer is asking amiss because it
   is entirely for himself. He wants to prosper that he may enjoy himself.
   He wants to be great simply that he may be admired--his prayer begins
   and ends with self. Look at the indecency of such a prayer even if it
   is sincere. When a man so prays, he asks God to be his servant and
   gratify his desires. No, worse than that! He wants God to join him in
   the service of his lusts! He will gratify his lusts and God shall come
   and help him to do it! Such prayer is blasphemous, but a large quantity
   of it is offered and it must be one of the most God-provoking things
   that Heaven ever beholds!

   No, if a man will live to himself and his lusts, let him do so, and the
   further he gets off from God the more consistent he will be. Let him
   not mouth the Lord's Prayer as though God were his father, or drag in
   Christ's sacred name to sanctify his greed, or invoke the Spirit's
   blessed power in connection with his personal aggrandizement or his
   selfish ambition! If he does so, he will be no better off than he was
   at the beginning--he will ask, and have not. His asking will miss
   because he asks amiss, that he may consume it upon his lusts. If your
   desires are the longings of fallen nature; if your desires begin and
   end with yourself and if the chief end for which you live is not to
   glorify God, but to glorify yourself, then you may fight, but you shall
   not have!

   You may rise up early and sit up late, but nothing worth gaining shall
   come of it! Remember how the Lord has spoken in the 37th Psalm--"Cease
   from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not yourself in any wise to do
   evil. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yes, you
   shall diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek
   shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance
   of peace."

   So much upon the poverty of lusting.

   II. Secondly, I have now before me a serious business, and that is, to
   show HOW CHRISTIAN CHURCHES MAY SUFFER SPIRITUAL POVERTY so that they,
   too, "desire to have, and cannot obtain." Of course the Christian seeks
   higher things than the worldling, otherwise he were not worthy of that
   name at all. At least, professedly, his objective is to obtain the true
   riches and to glorify God in spirit and in truth. Yes, but look, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, all Churches do not get what they desire. We have
   to complain, not here and there, but in many places, of Churches that
   are nearly asleep and are gradually declining.

   Of course they find excuses. The population is dwindling, or another
   place of worship is attracting the people. There is always a handy
   excuse when a man needs one. But still, there stands the fact--public
   worship is almost deserted in some places, the ministry has no rallying
   power about it--and those who put in an appearance are discontented or
   indifferent. In such Churches there are no conversions. If they had
   half-a-dozen added to them in a year, they would need to sing the
   "Hallelujah Chorus"! But as to bringing thousands to Christ, they
   secretly fear that this would be an undesirable thing, for it might
   involve excitement--and they are so proper that they dread anything of
   that sort!

   To do nothing and let men be damned is, in their judgment, proper and
   respectable. But to be alive and energetic is a perilous state of
   affairs, for it might lead to fanaticism and indecorum! They are
   specially afraid of anything like "sensationalism." That ugly-looking
   word they set before us very much as the Chinese try to frighten their
   enemies by painting horrible faces on their shields! Never mind that
   terrible word--it will hurt no one! These Churches "have not," for no
   Truth of God is made prevalent through their zeal; no sin is smitten;
   no holiness promoted; nothing is done by which God is glorified. And
   what is the reason for it?

   First, even among professed Christians there may be the pursuit of
   desirable things in a wrong method. "You fight and war, yet you have
   not," Have not Churches thought to prosper by competing with other
   Churches? At such-and-such a place of worship they have a very clever
   man--we must get a clever man, too! In fact, he must be a little
   cleverer than our neighbor's hero. That is the thing--a clever man! Ah
   me, that we should live in an age in which we talk about clever men in
   preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ! Alas, that this holy service
   should be thought to depend upon human cleverness! Churches have
   competed with each other in architecture, in music, in apparel and in
   social status. The leaders fancy that to succeed they must have
   something more handsome, artistic, or expensive than their
   neighbors--therefore they build Gothic edifices in which the minister's
   voice gets up among the timbers and is never properly heard--or else
   they purchase an organ with every stop except the full one!

   The opinion would seem to be widely spread that there is a deal of
   Grace in an organ. To pray to God with a windmill, like the Tartars,
   would be very absurd! But to praise God with wind passing through a set
   of pipes is eminently proper! I never have seen the distinction and do
   not see it now. Organ or no organ is not, now, the question, but I
   speak of instances in which these machines are set up as a matter of
   rivalry. Is it not the design of many to succeed by a finer building,
   better music and a cleverer ministry than others? Is it not as much a
   matter of competition as a shop front and a dressed window are with
   drapers? Is this the way by which the Kingdom of God is to grow up
   among us?

   In some cases there is a measure of bitterness in the rivalry. It is
   not pleasant to little minds to see other Churches prospering more than
   their own. They may be more earnest than we are and be doing God's work
   better, but we are too apt to turn a jealous eye towards them--and we,
   frankly, would rather they did not get on quite so well. Do you think
   that the Scripture says in vain, "The spirit that dwells in us lusts to
   envy?" If we could see a disturbance among them, so that they would
   break up and be ecclesiastically killed, we would not rejoice. Of
   course not! But neither should we suffer any deadly sorrow! In some
   Churches an evil spirit lingers. I bring no railing accusation and,
   therefore, say no more than this--God will never bless such means and
   such a spirit--those who give way to them will desire to have, but
   never obtain.

   Meanwhile, what is the reason why they do not have a blessing? The text
   says, "Because you ask not." I am afraid there are Churches which do
   not ask. Prayer in all forms is too much neglected. Private prayer is
   allowed to decay. I shall put it to the conscience of every man how far
   secret prayer is attended to and how much of fellowship with God there
   is in secret among the members of our Churches. Certainly its healthy
   existence is vital to Church prosperity. Of family prayer it is more
   easy to judge, for we can see it. I fear that in these days many have
   quite given up family prayer. I pray you do not imitate them!

   I wish you were all of the same mind as the Scotch laborer who obtained
   employment in the house of a wealthy farmer who was known to pay well.
   All his friends envied him that he had gone to live in such a service.
   In a short time he returned to his native village. And when they asked
   him why he had left his situation, he replied that, he "could not live
   in a house which had no roof to it." A house without prayer is a house
   without a roof! We cannot expect blessings on our Churches if we have
   none on our families! As to the congregational prayer, the gathering
   together in what we call our Prayer Meetings--is there not a falling
   off? In many cases the Prayer Meeting is despised and looked down upon
   as a sort of second-rate gathering. There are members of Churches who
   are never present and it does not prick their consciences that they
   stay away.

   Some congregations mix up the Prayer Meeting with a lecture, so as to
   hold only one service in the week. I read the other day an excuse for
   all this--it is said that people are better at home, attending to
   family concerns. This is idle talk! Who among us wishes people to
   neglect their domestic concerns? It will be found that those best
   attend to their own concerns who are diligent to get everything in
   order, so that they may go out to assemblies for worship. Negligence of
   the House of God is often an index of negligence of their own houses!
   They are not bringing their children to Christ, I am persuaded, or they
   would bring them up to the services. Anyway, the prayers of the Church
   measure its prosperity. If we restrain prayer we restrain the blessing.

   Our true success as Churches can only be had by asking it of the Lord.
   Are we not prepared to reform and amend in this matter? Oh for Zion's
   travailing hour to come, when an agony of prayer shall move the whole
   body of the faithful! But some reply, "There are Prayer Meetings and we
   do ask for the blessing, and yet it comes not." Is not the explanation
   to be found in the other part of the text, "You have not, because you
   ask amiss"? When Prayer Meetings become a mere form; when Brothers and
   Sisters stand up and waste the time away with their long orations
   instead of speaking to God in earnest and burning words; when there is
   no expectation of a blessing--when the prayer is cold and chill--then
   nothing will come of it. He who prays without fervency does not pray at
   all! We cannot commune with God, who is a consuming fire, if there is
   no fire in our prayers!

   Many prayers fail of their errand because there is no faith in them.
   Prayers which are filled with doubt are requests for refusal. Imagine
   that you wrote to a friend and said, "Dear Friend, I am in great
   trouble and I, therefore, tell you, and ask for your help because it
   seems right to do so. But though I thus write, I have no belief that
   you will send me any help. Indeed, I should be mightily surprised if
   you did and should speak of it as a great wonder." Will you get the
   help, do you think? I should say your friend would be sensible enough
   to observe the little confidence which you have in him and he would
   reply that, as you did not expect anything, he would not astonish you.
   Your opinion of his generosity is so low that he does not feel called
   upon to put himself out of the way on your account. When prayers are of
   that kind you cannot wonder if we "have not, because we ask amiss."

   Moreover, if our praying, however earnest and believing it may be, is a
   mere asking that our Church may prosper because we want to glory in its
   prosperity--if we want to see our own denomination largely increased
   and its respectability improved, that we may share the honors
   thereof--then our desires are nothing but lusts, after all! Can it be
   that the children of God manifest the same emulations, jealousies and
   ambitious as men of the world? Shall religious work be a matter of
   rivalry and contest? Ah, then, the prayers which seek success will have
   no acceptance at the Mercy Seat! God will not hear us, but bid us be
   gone, for He cares not for the petitions of which self is the object.
   "You have not, because you ask not, or because you ask amiss."

   ' III. Thirdly, I have a much more pleasing work to do, and that is to
   hint at THE WEALTH WHICH AWAITS THE USE OF THE RIGHT MEANS, namely, of
   asking rightly of God. I invite your most solemn attention to this
   matter, for it is vitally important. And my first observation is
   this--how very small, after all, is this demand which God makes of us.
   Ask? Why, it is the least thing He can possibly expect of us, and it is
   no more than we ordinarily require of those who need help from us! We
   expect a poor man to ask and if he does not, we lay the blame of his
   lack upon himself. If God will give for the asking and we remain poor,
   who is to blame? Is not the blame most grievous? Does it not look as if
   we were out of order with God, so that we will not even condescend to
   ask a favor of Him? Surely, there must be, in our hearts, a lurking
   enmity to Him, or else, instead of its being an unwelcome necessity, it
   would be regarded as a great delight!

   However, Brothers and Sisters, whether we like it or not, remember,
   asking is the rule of the Kingdom. "Ask, and you shall receive." It is
   a rule that never will be altered in anybody's case. Our Lord Jesus
   Christ is the elder Brother of

   the family, but God has not relaxed the rule for Him! Remember this
   text--Jehovah says to His own Son, "Ask of Me and I will give You the
   heathen for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
   Your possession." If the royal and Divine Son of God cannot be exempted
   from the rule of asking, that He may have, you and I cannot expect the
   rule to be relaxed in our favor!

   Why should it be? What reason can be pleaded why we should be exempted
   from prayer? What argument can there be why we should be deprived of
   the privilege and delivered from the necessity of supplication? I can
   see none--can you? God will bless Elijah and send rain on Israel, but
   Elijah must pray for it. If the chosen nation is to prosper, Samuel
   must plead for it. If the Jews are to be delivered, Daniel must
   intercede. God will bless Paul and the nations shall be converted
   through him, but Paul must pray! Pray he did, without ceasing--his
   Epistles show that he expected nothing except by asking for it. If you
   may have everything by asking and nothing without asking, I beg you to
   see how absolutely vital prayer is! And I beseech you to abound in it.

   Moreover, it is clear to even the most shallow thinker that there are
   some things necessary for the Church of God which we cannot get except
   by prayer. You can get that clever man I spoke about--the less,
   perhaps, you pray about him, the better! And that new Church, and the
   new organ, and the choir you can also get without prayer--but you
   cannot get the heavenly anointing--the gift of God is not to be
   purchased with money! Some of the members of a Church in a primitive
   village in America thought that they would raise a congregation by
   hanging up a very handsome chandelier in the Meeting House. People
   talked about this chandelier and some went to see it--but the light of
   it soon grew dim.

   You can buy all sorts of ecclesiastical furniture! You can purchase any
   kind of paint, brass, muslin, blue scarlet and fine linen--together
   with flutes, harps, sackbuts, psalteries and all kinds of music--you
   can get these without prayer. In fact, it would be an impertinence to
   pray about such rubbish! But you cannot get the Holy Spirit without
   prayer. "He blows where He wills." He will not be brought near by any
   process or method at our command apart from asking. There are no
   mechanical means which will make up for His absence! If the Holy Spirit
   is not there, what is the use of that clever man of yours? Will anybody
   be converted? Will any soul be comforted? Will any children of God be
   renewed in spiritual life without the Holy Spirit? Neither can you get
   communion with God without prayer. He that will not pray, cannot have
   communion with God. Yet more, there is no real, spiritual communion of
   the Church with its own members when prayer is suspended. Prayer must
   be in action, or else those blessings which are vitally essential to
   the success of the Church can never come to it. Prayer is the great
   door of spiritual blessing and if you close it, you shut out the favor.

   Beloved Brothers and Sisters, do you not think that this asking, which
   God requires, is a very great privilege? Suppose there were an edict
   published that you must not pray--that would be a hardship, indeed! If
   prayer rather interrupted, than increased the stream of blessing, it
   would be a sad calamity. Did you ever see a dumb man under a strong
   excitement, or suffering great pain and, therefore, anxious to speak?
   It is a terrible sight to see! The face is distorted, the body is
   fearfully agitated--the mute writhes and labors in dire distress. Every
   limb is contorted with a desire to help the tongue, but it cannot break
   its bonds! Hollow sounds come from the breast and stuttering of
   ineffectual speech awaken attention, though they cannot reach so far as
   expression. The poor creature is in unspeakable pain!

   Suppose we were, in our spiritual nature, full of strong desires and
   yet dumb as to the tongue of prayer? I think it would be one of the
   direst afflictions that could possibly befall us! We should be terribly
   maimed and dismembered--and our agony would be overwhelming! Blessed be
   His name, the Lord ordains a way of utterance and bids our heart speak
   out to Him! Beloved, we must pray--it seems to me that it ought to be
   the first thing we ever think of doing when in need. If men were right
   with God and truly loved Him, they would pray as naturally as they
   breathe! I hope some of us are right with God and do not need to be
   driven to prayer, for it has become an instinct of our nature.

   I was told by a friend, yesterday, the story of a little German boy--a
   story which his pastor loved to tell. The dear little child believed
   his God and delighted in prayer. His schoolmaster had urged the
   scholars to be at school on time and this child always tried to be so.
   But his father and mother were slow people and, one morning, through
   their fault, alone, he just left the door as the clock struck the hour
   for the school to open. A friend, standing near, heard the little one
   cry, "Dear God, do grant I may be in time for school." It struck the
   listener that for once, prayer could not be heard, for the child had
   quite a little walk before him and the hour was already come. He was
   curious to see the result.

   Now it so happened that morning that the master, in trying to open the
   schoolhouse door, turned the key the wrong way and could not move the
   bolt. They had to send for a locksmith to open the door. Hence a delay
   and just as the door

   opened, our little friend entered with the rest, all in good time! God
   has many ways of granting right desires. It was most natural that,
   instead of crying and whining, a child that really loved God should
   speak to Him about his trouble. Should it not be natural to you and to
   me, spontaneously and at once, to tell the Lord our sorrows and ask for
   help? Should not this be the first resort? Alas, according to Scripture
   and observation--and, I grieve to add--according to experience, prayer
   is often the last thing!

   Look at the sick man in the 107th Psalm. Friends bring him various
   foods, but his soul abhors all manner of meat. The physicians do what
   they can to heal him, but he grows worse and worse, and draws near to
   the gates of death-- "Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble."
   That was put last which should have been first! "Send for the doctor.
   Prepare him nourishment. Wrap him in flannels!" All very well, but when
   will you pray to God? God will be called upon when the case grows
   desperate! Look at the mariners described in the same Psalm. The ship
   is well-near wrecked. "They mount up to the Heaven, they go down,
   again, to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble." Still
   they do all they can to ride out the storm. But when "they reel to and
   fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end: then
   they cry unto the Lord in their trouble."

   Oh, yes; God is sought when we are driven into a corner and ready to
   perish! And what a mercy it is that He hears such laggard prayers and
   delivers the suppliants out of their troubles! But ought it to be so
   with you and with me, and with Churches of Christ? Ought not the first
   impulse of a declining Church to be, "Let us pray day and night until
   the Lord appears for us. Let us meet together with one accord in one
   place and never separate until the blessing descends upon us"? Do you
   know, Brothers and Sisters, what great things are to be had for the
   asking? Have you ever thought of it? Does it not stimulate you to pray
   fervently? All Heaven lies before the grasp of the asking man! All the
   promises of God are rich and inexhaustible--and their fulfillment is to
   be had by prayer!

   Jesus says, "All things are delivered unto Me of My Father," and Paul
   says, "All things are yours, and you are Christ's." Who would not pray
   when all things are thus handed over to us? Yes, and promises that were
   first made to special individuals are all made to us if we know how to
   plead them in prayer. Israel went through the Red Sea ages ago and yet
   we read in the 66th Psalm, "There did we rejoice in Him." Only Jacob
   was present at Peniel and yet Hosea says, "There He spoke with us."
   Paul wants to give us a great promise for times of need and he quotes
   from the Old Testament, "For He has said, I will never leave you nor
   forsake you." Where did Paul get that? That is the assurance which the
   Lord gave to Joshua--"I will never leave you nor forsake you."

   Surely the promise was only for Joshua! No, it is for us! "No Scripture
   is of private interpretation." All Scripture is ours. See how God
   appears unto Solomon at night and says, "Ask what I shall give you."
   Solomon asks for wisdom. "Oh, that is Solomon," you say. Listen!--"If
   any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God." God gave Solomon wealth and
   fame in the bargain! Is not that peculiar to Solomon? No, for it is
   said of true wisdom, "Length of days is in her right hand, and in her
   left hand riches and honor"--and is not this much like our Savior's
   words, "Seek you first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and
   all these things shall be added unto you"? Thus, you see, the Lord's
   promises have many fulfillments and they are waiting to pour their
   treasures into the lap of prayer! Does not this lift prayer up to a
   high level, when God is willing to repeat the biographies of His saints
   in us when He is waiting to be gracious, and to load us with His
   benefits?

   I will mention another Truth of God which ought to make us pray and
   that is, that if we ask, God will give to us much more than we ask.
   Abraham asked of God that Ishmael might live before Him. He thought,
   "Surely this is the promised seed: I cannot expect that Sarah will bear
   a child in her old age. God has promised me a seed, and surely it must
   be this child of Hagar. Oh that Ishmael might live before You." God
   granted him that and He gave him Isaac, as well, and all the blessings
   of the Covenant! There is Jacob. He kneels down to pray and asks the
   Lord to give him bread to eat and raiment to put on. But what did his
   God give him? When he came back to Bethel, he had two bands, thousands
   of sheep and camels, and much wealth! God had heard him and done
   exceeding abundantly above what he asked!

   It is said of David, "The king asked life of You, and You gave him
   length of days," yes, gave him not only length of days, but a throne
   for his sons throughout all generations, till David went in and sat
   before the Lord, overpowered with the Lord's goodness. "Well," you say,
   "but is that true of New Testament prayers? "Yes, it is so with the New
   Testament pleaders, whether saints or sinners! They brought a man to
   Christ, sick of the palsy, and asked Him to heal him. And He said,
   "Son, your sins are forgiven you." He had not asked that, had he? No,
   but God gives greater things than we ask for!

   Hear that poor, dying thief's humble prayer, "Lord, remember me when
   You enter into Your Kingdom." Jesus replies, "Today shall you be with
   Me in Paradise"! He had not dreamed of such an honor!

   Even the story of the Prodigal teaches us this. He resolved to say, "I
   am not worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired
   servants." What is the answer? "This my son was dead, and is alive
   again: bring forth the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his
   hands, and shoes on his feet." Once get into the position of an asker
   and you shall have what you never asked for and never thought to
   receive! The text is often misquoted--"God is able to do exceeding
   abundantly above all that we can ask, or even think." We could ask, if
   we were but more sensible and had more faith, for the very greatest
   things, but God is willing to give us infinitely more than we ask for!

   At this moment I believe that God's Church might have inconceivable
   blessings if she were but ready, now, to pray. Did your ever notice
   that wonderful picture in the 8th chapter of Revelation? It is worthy
   of careful notice. I shall not attempt to explain it, in its context,
   but merely point to the picture as it hangs on the wall by itself. Read
   on--"When He has opened the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven
   about the space of half an hour." Silence in Heaven!? There were no
   anthems, ho hallelujahs, not an angel stirred a wing! Silence in
   Heaven!? Can you imagine it? And look! You see seven angels standing
   before God and to them are given seven trumpets. There they wait,
   trumpet in hand, but there is no sound! Not a single note of cheer or
   warning during an interval which was sufficiently long to provoke
   lively emotion, but short enough to prevent impatience.

   Silence unbroken, profound, awful, reigned in Heaven! Action is
   suspended in Heaven, the center of all activity. "And another angel
   came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer." There he stands,
   but no offering is presented-- everything has come to a standstill.
   What can possibly set it in motion? "And there was given unto him much
   incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon
   the golden altar which was before the throne." Prayer is presented
   together with the merit of the Lord Jesus! Now, see what will
   happen--"And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of
   the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hands." That is
   the key of the whole matter!

   Now you will see--the angel begins to work--he takes the censer, fills
   it with the altar fire and flings it down upon the earth, "and there
   were voices, and thundering and lightning and earthquake." "And the
   seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to
   sound." Everything is moving now! As soon as the prayers of the saints
   were mixed with the incense of Christ's eternal merit and begun to
   smoke up from the altar, then prayer became effectual! Down fell the
   living coals among the sons of men, while the angels of the Divine
   Providence, who stood still, before, sound their thunder blasts, and
   the will of the Lord is done! Such is the scene in Heaven, in a certain
   measure, even to this day. Bring here the incense! Bring here the
   prayers of the saints! Set them on fire with Christ's merits and on the
   golden altar let them smoke before the Most High! Then shall we see the
   Lord at work and His will shall be done on earth as it is in Heaven!
   God send His blessing with these words, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Great Cross-bearer and His Followers

   (No. 1683)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 8, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when they had mocked Him, they took off the purple from Him, and
   put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him." Mark
   15:20.

   "And He, bearing His Cross, went forth." John 19:17.

   "And they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of
   the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear the Cross."
   Mark 15:21.

   WHEN our Lord had been condemned to die, the execution of His sentence
   was hurried. The Jews were in great haste to shed His blood. So intense
   was the enmity of the chief priests and Pharisees, that every moment of
   delay was wearisome to them. Besides, it was the day of the Passover
   and they wished to have this matter finished before they went, with
   hypocritical piety, to celebrate the festival of Israel's deliverance!
   We do not wonder at their eagerness, for they could not bear themselves
   while He lived, since His very Presence reproved them for their
   falsehood and hypocrisy.

   But at Pilate, we do wonder, and herein he is much to be blamed. In all
   civilized countries there is usually an interval between the sentencing
   of the prisoner and the time of his being put to death. As the capital
   sentence is irreversible, it is well to have a little space in which
   possible evidence may be forthcoming which may prevent the fatal
   stroke. In some countries we have thought that there has been a cruelly
   long delay between the sentence and the execution, but with the Romans
   it was usual to allow the reasonable respite of 10 days.

   Now, I do not say that it was incumbent upon Pilate, according to Roman
   Law, to have allowed 10 days to a Jew, who had not the rights of Roman
   citizenship, but I do say that he might have pleaded the custom of his
   country and so have secured a delay--and afterwards he might have
   released his prisoner. It was within his reach to have done so and he
   was blameworthy, as he was all along, in thus yielding to the clamor
   for an immediate execution for no other reason than that he was
   "willing to content the people."

   When once we begin to make the wishes of other men our law, we know not
   to what extremity of criminality we may be led. And so the Savior's
   hasty execution is due to Pilate's vacillating spirit and to the
   insatiable blood-thirstiness of the scribes and Pharisees. Being given
   over to death, our Savior was led away and, I suppose, the painters are
   right when they put a rope about His neck or His loins, for the idea of
   being led in an open street would seem to imply some sort of bond--"He
   was led as a sheep to the slaughter." Alas, that the Emancipator of our
   race should be led forth as a captive to die!

   The direction in which He is led is outside the city. He must not die
   in Jerusalem, though multitudes of Prophets had perished there. Though
   the Temple was the central place of sacrifice, yet the Son of God must
   not be offered there, for He was an offering of another kind and must
   not lie upon their altars. He must be led outside the city because, by
   the Jews, He was treated as a flagrant offender who must be executed at
   the Tyburn of the city, in the appointed place of doom known as Calvary
   or Golgotha. When Naboth was unjustly condemned for blasphemy, they
   carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he
   died. And afterwards Stephen--when they cried out against him as a
   blasphemer, they cast him out of the city and there they stoned him.

   Our Savior, therefore, must die in the ordinary place of execution,
   that in all respects He might be numbered with the transgressors. The
   rulers of the city so loathed and detested their great Reprover that
   they rejected Him and would not suffer Him to die within their city
   walls! Alas, poor Jerusalem, in casting out the Son of David, you did
   cast out your

   last hope--now are you bound over to desolation! He was led outside of
   the city because, from that time on, no acceptable sacrifice could be
   offered there. They might go on with their offering of daily lambs and
   they might sacrifice their bullocks and burn the fat of fed beasts--but
   from that day the substance of the sacrifice had gone away from them
   and Israel's offerings were vain oblations.

   Because the true Sacrifice is rejected of them, the Lord leaves them
   nothing but a vain show. Still more forcible is the fact that our Lord
   must die outside the city because He was to be consumed as a
   sin-offering. It is written in the Law, "And the skin of the bullock,
   and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards,
   and his dung, even the whole bullock shall he carry forth outside the
   camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him
   on the wood with fire." There were several sorts of offerings under the
   Law--the sweet-savor offerings were presented upon the altar and were
   accepted of God, but sin-offerings were burnt outside the camp, or
   gate, because God can have no fellowship with sin.

   Once let sin be imputed to the sacrifice and it becomes abhorrent to
   God and must not be presented in the tabernacle or the Temple, but
   burned outside the circle wherein His people have their habitations.
   And here let our hearts gratefully contemplate how truly our Lord Jesus
   became a Sin-Offering for us and how, in every point, He followed out
   the type. With His face turned away from His Father's House, He must go
   to die--with His face turned away from what were once His Father's
   people, He must be led forth to be crucified. Like a thing accursed, He
   is to be hung up where felons suffer deserved punishment. Because we
   were sinners and because sin had turned our backs to God--and because
   sin had broken our communion with God's accepted ones--therefore must
   He endure this banishment.

   In that sorrowful march of the Cross-bearing Savior, my soul, with
   sorrow, sees herself represented as deserving thus to be made to depart
   unto death. And yet joy mingles with this emotion, for the glorious
   Sin-Bearer has thus taken away our sin and we return from our exile!
   His Substitution is infinitely effectual! Well may those live for whom
   Jesus died! Well may those retain in whose place the Son of God was
   banished! There is entrance into the Holy City, now! There is entrance
   into the Temple, now! Now there is access unto God, Himself, because
   the Lord has put away our sin through Him who was led to be crucified
   outside the city gate!

   Nor do I think that even this exhausts the teaching. Jesus dies outside
   Jerusalem because He died, not for Jerusalem, alone, nor for Israel,
   alone. The effect of His Atonement is not circumscribed by the walls of
   a city nor by the boundaries of a race. In Him shall all the nations of
   the earth be blessed! Out in the open He must die to show that He
   reconciled both Jews and Gentiles unto God! "For He is the propitiation
   for our sins," says Paul, who was, himself, a Jew, "and not for ours
   only, but also for the sins of the whole world." Had He been the Savior
   of Jews, only, seclusion in the place of His offering would have been
   appropriate, but us He dies for all nations, He is hung up outside the
   city.

   And yet, once more, He suffered outside the gate that we might go forth
   unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. "Come you out from
   among them; be you separate, touch not the unclean thing," from now on
   becomes the command of God to all His sons and daughters! Behold the
   Son of sons, His Only-Begotten, leads the way in nonconformity to this
   present evil world, being, Himself, officially severed from the old
   Jewish church, whose elders seek His life! He dies in sacred separation
   from the false and corrupt corporation which vaunted itself to be the
   chosen of God! He protested against all evil and for this He died, so
   far as His murderers were concerned.

   Even so must His followers take up their cross and follow Him wherever
   He goes, even though they are to be despised and rejected of men. See
   what instruction is found in the choice of the place wherein our great
   Redeemer offers Himself unto God!

   I. Let us draw near to our Lord for a while and carefully observe each
   instructive detail. Our imagination pictures the Blessed One standing
   outside the gate of Herod's palace in the custody of a hand of soldiers
   with a centurion at their head. And we begin, at once, to observe HIS
   DRESS. That may seem a small matter, but it is not without instruction.
   How is He dressed? Our text tells us that when they had mocked Him,
   they took off the purple from Him and put His own clothes on Him. But
   we are not told that they took off the crown of thorns and, therefore,
   it has been currently believed that He continued to wear it to the
   Cross and on the Cross.

   Is not this highly probable? Surely if the thorny crown had been
   withdrawn, this would have been the place to have said, "They took off
   the purple from Him and removed the crown of thorns." But it is not so
   written and, therefore, we may believe that the sorrowful coronet
   remained upon Him. Pilate wrote upon his accusation, "the King of the
   Jews,"

   and it was not unfitting that He should continue to wear a crown. Jesus
   died a crowned monarch, King of the curse! The Lord God in justice said
   to rebel man, "Cursed is the ground for your sake: thorns, also, and
   thistles shall it bring forth to you." And lo, the Man by whom we are
   redeemed is crowned with that product of the earth which came of the
   curse--

   "O sacred head surrounded

   By crown of piercing thorn!

   O bleeding head, so wounded,

   Reviled and put to scorn."

   Probably also, as I have said, He was bound, for they led Him as a
   sheep to the slaughter. But this binding was probably more abundant
   than that which we have hinted at, if it is, indeed, true that by Roman
   custom criminals were bound with cords to the cross which they were
   doomed to carry. If this was the case, you may picture our Lord with
   His Cross hound to Himself and hear Him say, "Bind the Sacrifice with
   cords, even to the horns of the altar." But the chief point to be noted
   is that Jesus wore His own clothes, the usual garments which He was
   accustomed to wear and this, no doubt, for identification, that all who
   looked on might know that it was the same Person who had preached in
   their streets and had healed their sick. They were under no
   misapprehension--they knew that it was Jesus of Nazareth--the keen hate
   of the scribes and Pharisees would not have permitted any substitution
   of another. It was none other than He and His garments were the ensigns
   of that truth.

   He wore His own clothes, also, for another reason, namely, that there
   might be a fulfillment of prophecy. It may not strike you, at first,
   but you will soon see it. Our Lord must not go to die in the purple--He
   must march to the Cross in that vestment which was without seam and
   woven from the top throughout, or else the Word of God could not have
   been fulfilled, "They parted My garments among them, and upon My
   vesture did they cast lots." Other raiment could readily have been torn
   and divided, but this garment, which was peculiar to the Savior, could
   not have been so torn without destroying it and, therefore, the
   soldiers cast lots for it! Little did they who put it on Him dream that
   they were thus accessory to the fulfillment of a prophecy!

   Does it not strike you as strange that the Pharisees, who were so full
   of hatred to Christ, did not carefully draw back from the fulfillment
   of so many types and prophecies? Their rabbis and teachers knew the
   prophecy of Zechariah, that the Messiah should be sold for 30 pieces of
   silver--why did it not occur to them to make their bribe to Judas 29 or
   31 silver pieces? Why, again, did they cast the price unto the potter
   by buying from him the field of blood? Could they not, so to speak,
   thereby have balked the prophecy? Here were voluntarily fulfilled, by
   themselves, prophecies which condemned them! I shall have to show you
   the same thing further on, but, meanwhile, observe that if it had been
   their objective to fulfill type and prophecy, they could not have acted
   more carefully than they did. So they put His own garments on Him and
   unwittingly furnished the possibility for the fulfillment of the
   Prophet's words--"They parted My garments among them, and cast lots
   upon My vesture."

   To me there occurs one other thought touching His wearing His own
   garments. I do not know if I can express it, but it seems to me to
   indicate that our Lord's passion was a true and natural part of His
   life. He died as He lived. His death was not a new departure, but the
   completion of a life of self-sacrifice, and so He had no need to put on
   a fresh garb. Look! He goes to die in His ordinary, everyday garments!
   Does not it almost seem as if people put on their Sunday clothes
   because they regard religion as something quite distinct from their
   common life? Do you not wish to see godliness in work-day clothes?
   Religion in its shirt-sleeves? Grace in a smock-frock? Do you not
   almost cry concerning some loud talkers--"Put his own clothes on him
   and then lead him out and let us see him"?

   It should be an integral part of our life to live and to die for our
   God. Must we become other men if we are to be God's men? Can we not
   wear our own clothes, habits, characteristics and peculiarities and
   serve the Lord? Is there not some suspicion of unnaturalness in
   services which require men to put on a strange, outlandish dress?
   Surely they find their worship to be on another level than their
   life--they must step out of their way and dress up to attend to it! It
   is evil for a man, when he cannot lead his fellows in prayer till he
   has gone to the wardrobe! Time was when vestments meant something, but
   ever since our great High Priest went up to His one Sacrifice wearing
   His common clothes, all types are fulfilled and laid aside.

   Now, we pray not officially, or we should need the robe--but we pray
   personally and our own clothes suit us well. Jesus continued the unity
   of His life as He approached its close and did not, even in appearance,
   change His way. He lived to die a Sacrifice--this was the climax of His
   life, the apex of the towering pyramid of His perfect obedience! No
   mark is

   set, no line is drawn between His passion and all the rest of His life,
   nor should there be a screen between our life and death. Somehow, I
   dread a death which is meant to be pictorial and exhibitional. I am not
   an admirer of Addison's death, as some are, who praise him because he
   sent for a young lord and cried, "Come, see how a Christian can die!"

   I like better, Bengel's wish, when he desired to die just as a person
   would slip out from company because someone beckoned him outside. Such
   a person modestly thinking his presence or absence to be of small
   account in a great world, quietly withdraws and only friends observe
   that he is gone. Death should be part of the usual curriculum, the
   close of the day's work, the entrance into harbor which ends the
   voyage. It is well to feel that you can die easily because you have
   done it so many times before! He who dies daily will not fear to die!
   Bathe in the Jordan often and you will not dread the fording of it when
   your hour has come.

   Our blessed Lord lived such a dying life that He made no show of death.
   He did not change His tone and spirit any more than His garments, but
   died as He lived. They put His own clothes on Him--He had not, Himself
   taken them off-- it was no wish of His to wear the purple even, for an
   hour, either in reality or in mockery. He was evermore the same and His
   own vesture best beseemed Him. Truly, blessed Master, we may well say,
   "All Your garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia"--even though
   they take You not out of "the ivory palaces wherein they have made You
   glad"--but out of the common guardroom, where they had made You to be
   despised and mocked and spit upon. Come from where You may, Your
   vesture has a fragrant smell about it, and all Your Brothers and
   Sisters rejoice therein.

   II. Brethren, I beg you, for a few minutes, to look at HIS COMPANY. Who
   were they that were with our Lord when He came to die? First and
   nearest to Him were the rough Roman soldiers--strong, muscular,
   unfeeling men--ready to shed blood at any moment. In them, human
   affection was kept down by stern discipline. They were the iron
   instruments of an empire of iron. They would do what they were bid and
   feeling and sympathy were not allowed to interfere. I do but bid you
   look at these guards to remind you that from beneath their eagle, our
   Savior won a trophy, for their centurion at our Lord's death uttered
   the confession, "Certainly this was the Son of God." This was a blessed
   confession of faith and I delight to think of our Lord as thus becoming
   the Conqueror of His conquerors by taking one out of them to be His
   disciple and witness, as we would gladly believe he was. Surely after
   openly making the clear confession which the Evangelist has recorded,
   we may number him with Believers!

   Next to these guards were two malefactors, led out with Him to
   execution. That was intended to increase His scorn. He must not be
   separated from the basest of men, but He must be led forth between two
   thieves, having previously had a murderer preferred to Him. They seem
   to have been very hardened scoundrels, for they reviled Him. I mention
   them because our Lord won a trophy by the conversion of one of them,
   who, when dying, said, "We suffer justly, but this Man has done nothing
   amiss," and then prayed, "Lord, remember me when You come into Your
   Kingdom." This dying thief has brought more Glory to Christ than
   hundreds of us, for in every place wherever this Gospel has been
   preached, this has been told as a memorial of him and as a comfort to
   the guiltiest to look to Jesus! In the act of death, he believed in
   Christ and believed when the Lord, Himself, was in the act of
   death--and that day he was with Him in Paradise!

   How have You conquered, O You despised of men! How have You won, by
   Your gentleness, both Roman legionnaires and Jewish thieves! Beyond the
   prisoners were the scribes, Pharisees and High Priests. I could not
   picture their faces, but surely they must have been about the worst lot
   of humans that were ever seen, as with a fiendish delight they stared
   at Jesus! He had called them, "hypocrites." He had spoken of them as
   "making clean the outside of the cup and platter," while their inner
   part was wickedness--and now they are showing their venom and silencing
   His reproofs. But their hate was so insatiable that it was accompanied
   with fear and that night it was seen that Christ had conquered them,
   for they crouched before Pilate and begged a guard to prevent their
   Victim from leaving the tomb.

   In their heart of hearts they feared that, after all, He might really
   be the Son of God! Thus were they, also, vanquished--though to them the
   Lord Jesus was a savor of death unto death--yet they could not but be
   affected by Him and vanquished by His death. Their hate brought with it
   alarm, fear and agitation--they trembled before the Nazarene. Look at
   the scene! Though the despised and sorrowful One is bowed down beneath
   His Cross, you can see at a glance the majesty which dwells in Him! But
   as you look at them--the mean, wretched seed of the serpent--they seem
   to go upon their bellies and dust is their meat! Jesus is all truth and
   openness and they are all cunning and craft. You can see, at a glance,
   that as an angel is to the fiends of Hell, so is the Christ to His
   persecutors! That face stained with spit and

   blackened with blows, and punctured with thorns, wears a more than
   imperial Glory, while their faces are as the countenances of slaves and
   criminals!

   Around these there is a great rabble and if you look into the mob, you
   see with surprise that they are the same crowd who, a week ago, shouted
   "Hosanna! Hosanna!" They have changed their note and cry, "Crucify Him!
   Crucify Him!" For a few pence they were bribed to do so--they were an
   ignorant, fickle mob. When such do hiss at you for doing right, forgive
   them. When they point the finger of scorn at you for being a Christian,
   regard them not. It little matters what they may say or do. They yelled
   at Him who was their host Benefactor and ours. The Lord Christ endured
   the popular scorn as He had once received the popular acclamation! He
   lived above it all, for He knew that men of low degree are vanity.
   Vanity of vanities! All that comes of vain man is vanity!

   Yes, but there was a little change for the better in the company--there
   was just a streak of light in that cloud--for kindly women were in the
   throng. These were not all His disciples, perhaps few of them were
   such, for otherwise He would not have bid them weep over a woe which
   His disciples escaped--but they were tender-hearted women who could not
   look upon Him without tears. It is said by Luke that they bewailed and
   lamented Him. They knew how innocent He was and how kind He had been.
   Perhaps some of them had received favors at His hands and, therefore,
   they wept sorely that He should die. It was well done of them. In all
   the Evangelists there is no instance of a woman that had any hand in
   the death of Christ. As far as they are connected with the matter, they
   are guiltless--they rather oppose His death than promote it.

   Woman was last at the Cross and first at the sepulcher and, therefore,
   we can never say a word about her being the first in the transgression.
   Oh, kind eyes that gave the Lord of Love the tribute of their pity!
   Blessed are you of compassionate Heaven! But the Savior desired not, at
   that time, that human sympathy should be spent upon Him, for His great
   heart was big with sorrows not His own. He knew that when the children
   of those women had grown up and while yet some of the younger women
   would still be alive, their awful woe would make them exclaim, "Blessed
   are the barren and the wombs that never bear, and the paps that never
   gave suck." When they saw the slain of the Romans and the slain of
   their own contending factions, then would they mourn! The Master,
   therefore said--

   "Weep not for Me! Oh! Weep not, Salem's daughters, Faint though you see
   Me, stay the bursting tear! Turn the sad tide--the tide of bitter
   waters-- Back on yourselves for desolation near." It was well on the
   woman's part; it was better, still, on His, that He gently set the
   draught of sympathy to one side because their coming sorrow oppressed
   Him more deeply than His own.

   We must now leave the company, but not till we have asked, Where are
   His disciples? Where is Peter? Did he not say, "I will go with You to
   prison and to death"? Where is John? Where are they all? They have fled
   and have not yet returned to speak a word to Him or for Him. Holy women
   are gathering, but where are the men? Though the women are brave and
   act like men, the men are fearful and act as women! We are poor helpers
   to our Master. Had we been there, we should have done the same as they
   did, if not worse, for they were the flower of our Israel. Ah, me, how
   little are we worth for whom the Ever-Blessed paid so much! Let us give
   clearer proof of loyalty and follow our Prince more closely.

   III. But now, come closer to the Savior--break through the company and
   hear my third talk with you while you look a little on HIS BURDEN. May
   the good Spirit teach me how to depict my Lord. We are told by John
   that our Savior, "went forth bearing His Cross." We might have
   supposed, so far as the other three Evangelists are concerned, that
   Simon the Cyrenian had carried the Cross all the way, but John fills up
   the blank space in their accounts. Our Lord carried His own Cross at
   the commencement of the sorrowful pilgrimage to Calvary. This was done,
   first, by way of increasing His shame. It was a custom of the Romans to
   make felons bear their own gallows and there is a word in the Latin,
   furcifer, which signifies, "gallows bearer," which was hissed at men in
   contempt, just as nowadays a despised individual might be called a
   "gallows-bird." Nothing was more disgraceful and, therefore, that must
   be added to the Redeemer's load of shame. He made Himself of no
   reputation for our sakes.

   Note, next, its weight. Usually only one beam of the cross was
   carried--it may have been so here. It does not look so, however, for
   the expression, "bearing His Cross," would naturally mean the whole of
   it. It is highly probable that, although that load could easily be
   borne by the rough, coarse criminals who ordinarily suffered, yet not
   so readily by the tender and more exquisite frame of our Divine Lord.
   It is difficult to find any other reason why they should have laid the

   Cross on Simon, unless it is true, as tradition says, that Jesus
   fainted beneath the burden. I care nothing for tradition, nor even for
   conjecture, but still, there must have been a reason and as we cannot
   believe that these people had any real mercy for Christ, we think they
   must have acted upon the cruel wish that He might not die on the road,
   but might at least live to be nailed to the tree. "The tender mercies
   of the wicked are cruel." This I leave.

   And now I call your attention to the fact that there was a typical
   evidence about this. If Simon had carried Christ's Cross all the way,
   we should have missed the type of Isaac, for Isaac, when he went to
   Mount Moriah to be offered up by his father, carried the wood for his
   own sacrifice. I think if I had been a Jew, full of hate to Jesus
   Christ, I would have said, "Do not let Him carry His Cross--that will
   be too much like Isaac carrying the wood." No, but knowing the type,
   they wantonly fulfill it! It is their own will that does it and yet,
   the predestination of the Eternal is fulfilled in every jot and
   tittle--and our great Isaac carries the wood with which He is to be
   offered up by His Father! How marvelous it is that there should be a
   fixed decree and yet an altogether unlimited free agency!

   The spiritual meaning of it, of course, was that Christ, in perfect
   obedience, was then carrying the load of our disobedience. The Cross,
   which was the curse, for, "Cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree," is
   borne on those blessed shoulders which were submissive to the will of
   God in all things. Our Lord's Cross-bearing is the representation of
   His bearing all our sin and, therefore, in it we rejoice. It also has a
   prophetic meaning--that Cross which He carried through Jerusalem shall
   go through Jerusalem again. It is His great weapon with which He
   conquers and wins the world--it is His scepter with which He shall
   rule--governing the hearts of His people by no more forceful means than
   by the love manifested on His Cross!

   "The government shall be upon His shoulder." That which He bore on His
   shoulder shall win obedience and they who take His yoke upon them shall
   find rest unto their souls.

   IV. I wish I had an hour during which I might speak upon the last head
   which bristles with points of interest, but I must give its lessons to
   you rather in rough remarks than in studied observations. The last
   thing to consider is HIS CROSS-BEARER. We are not told why the Roman
   soldiers laid the Cross on Simon. We have made a conjecture; but we
   leave it as a conjecture, although a highly probable one. If it is
   true, it lets us see how truly human our Master was. He had been all
   night in the garden, sweating, as it were, great drops of blood in His
   anguish. He had been before the San-hedrin. He had been before Pilate,
   then before Herod, then before Pilate, again! He had endured scourging;
   He had been mocked by the soldiers and it would have been a great
   wonder if His human frame had not shown some sign of exhaustion.

   Holy Scripture, by its example, teaches us great reticence about the
   sufferings of Jesus. Some of the medieval writers and certain good
   people who write devotional books are too apt to dilate upon every
   supposed grief of our Master, so as to harrow up your feelings, but it
   is the part of wisdom to imitate the ancient painter who, when he
   depicted Agamemnon as sacrificing his daughter, veiled the father's
   face. It is indelicate and almost indecent to write as some have done
   who would seem to be better acquainted with anatomy than awed by
   Divinity. Much that Jesus endured must forever remain veiled to
   us--whether He fainted once or twice or three times--or did not faint
   at all, we are not informed. And, therefore, we leave the idea in the
   obscurity of probability and reverently worship Him who was tender in
   body and soul and suffered even as we do. Oh, love surpassing knowledge
   which could make Him suffer so!

   There was a great singularity in the Providence which brought Simon
   upon the scene just when he appeared. The right man came forward at the
   right moment. That Simon did not come, at first, and that they did not
   place the Cross on him from the beginning was for the fulfillment of
   the type of Isaac to which allusion has been made. Thus Providence
   arranges all things wisely. Observe that Simon was pressed into this
   duty. The word used signifies that the person is impressed into the
   royal service. Simon was a pressed man and probably not a disciple of
   Christ at the time when he was loaded with the Cross. How often has a
   burden of sorrow been the means of bringing men to the faith of Jesus!
   He was coming in from the country about some business or other and they
   compelled him to bear His cross, impressing him into the service which
   otherwise he would have shunned, for, "he passed by," and would have
   gone on if he could.

   Roman soldiers were not accustomed to make many bones about what they
   chose to do. It was sufficient for them that he came under their
   notice--and carry the Cross, he must. His name was Simon--but where was
   that other Simon? What a silent, but strong rebuke this would be to
   him! Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, where were you? Another Simon has
   taken your place! Sometimes the Lord's servants are backward where they
   are expected to be forward and He

   finds other servitors for the time! If this has ever happened to us, it
   ought gently to rebuke us as long as we live. Brothers and Sisters,
   keep your places and let not another Simon occupy it! It is of Judas
   that it is said, "His bishopric shall another take," but a true
   disciple will retain his office.

   Remember that Word of our Lord, "Hold that fast which you have, that no
   man take your crown." Simon Peter lost a crown here and another head
   wore it! Simon was a Cyrenian--an African--I wonder if he was a black
   man? In the Acts of the Apostles, at the 13th chapter, we find mention
   of a Simeon that was called Niger, or black. We do not know whether he
   was the same man or not, but he was an African, for Cyrene lies just to
   the west of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. Surely
   the African has had his full share of cross-bearing for many an age! Oh
   that the pangs of his sorrow may bring forth a birth ofjoy! Blessed be
   he, whether African or Englishman, or who he may, that has the honor of
   bearing the Cross after Christ!

   He was coming in from the country. How often the Lord takes into His
   service the unsophisticated country people who, as yet, are untainted
   by the cunning and the vice of the city! Some young man is just come up
   from the country this very week and is commencing his apprenticeship in
   London. How I wish my Master would impress him at the city gates and do
   it in that Divine way of His to which the will of the impressed person
   yields a sweet consent! Would God you would come at once and take up
   the Cross of Jesus just at the city gate, before you learn the city's
   sin and plunge into its dangers! Happy is the Simon coming in from the
   country who shall, this day, be led to bear Christ's Cross! Good
   Master, fulfill our heart's desire and lay Your Cross on some
   unaccustomed shoulder even now!

   We are told he was the father of Alexander and Rufus. Which, my
   Brethren, is the greater honor to a man--to have a good father--or to
   be the father of good sons? Under the Old Testament rule, we usually
   read of a man, that he is the son of such an one, but here we come to
   another style and find it to a man's honor that he is the father of
   certain well-known Brothers--"the father of Alexander and Rufus."
   Surely, Mark knew these two sons, or he would not have cared to mention
   them. They must have been familiar to the Church, or he would not have
   thus described their father. It was their father who carried the Cross.
   It is exceedingly likely that this Rufus was he of whom Paul speaks in
   the last chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, for Mark was with Paul
   and by this means knew Simon and Rufus.

   Paul writes, "Salute Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and
   mine." His mother was such a motherly person that she had been a mother
   to Paul as well as to Rufus. Surely, if she was a mother to Paul, she
   was another disciple of Jesus, and it would look as if this man, his
   wife and his two sons all became converts to our Lord after he had
   carried His Cross! It is certainly not the most unlikely circumstance
   that has been accepted by us on the ground of probability. Oh, what a
   blessing to a man to be known by his sons! Pray, dear Christian
   Friends, you that have an Alexander and a Rufus, that it may be an
   honor to you to be known as their father! "Him they compelled to bear
   His Cross"--perhaps the heavier end of it, if it was really bound to
   Christ, as they say, or, as I judge, the whole of it.

   It matters little how it was, but Simon is the representative of the
   Church which follows Christ bearing His Cross. Here we may recall the
   language of Paul--"I fill up that which is behind." May I paraphrase
   it?--I take the hind end-- "of the sufferings of Christ for His body's
   sake, that is the Church." Everyone that will live godly in Christ
   Jesus must suffer persecution. Jesus said, "Whoever does not bear his
   cross and come after Me, cannot be My disciple." Here is a
   representative, then, of all the godly--this Simon bearing Christ's
   Cross! Mark, it was not a cross of his own making, like those of monks
   and nuns who put themselves to pains of their own inventing! It was
   Christ's Cross and he carried it not before Christ, as some do who talk
   of their poverty as though it would get them to Heaven, instead of
   resting on Christ's Cross. He carried it after Christ in its right
   place.

   This is the order--Christ in front bearing all our sin and we, behind,
   enduring shame and reproach for Him and counting it greater riches than
   all the treasures of Egypt! There is Simon and we will view him as a
   lesson to ourselves. First, let Simon be an example to us all and let
   us readily take up the cross after Christ. Whatever is involved in
   being a Christian, rejoice in it! If there is any shame; if there is
   any contumely; if there is loss; if there is any suffering--even if it
   were martyrdom--yet gladly take up the cross! Behold, the Father lays
   it upon you for Christ's sake!

   The next is advice to any of you that have been compelled to suffer as
   Christians though you are not Christians. I wonder whether there is
   anybody here who is only a press-man and yet has to bear the cross? A
   working man became a teetotaler--he did not mean to be a Christian, but
   when he went to work, his mates tempted him to drink and, as he would
   not join them, they attacked him as a Christian and said, "You are one
   of those canting hypocrites, those Wesley-

   ans, those Presbyterians, or those Spurgeonites!" This is not true of
   you, but thus, you see, the cross is forced on you! Had you not better
   take it up and bear it joyfully? They have pressed you into this
   service--take it as an index of the will of Providence, and say, "I
   will not be a press-man only--I will be a volunteer and I will
   cheerfully carry Christ's Cross."

   I know a man who merely comes to this place of worship because he is
   somewhat interested with the preaching, though he has no idea of being
   a converted man. Yet in the street where he lives nobody ever goes to a
   place of worship and, therefore, they set him down as a pious man and
   some have even ridiculed him for it. Friend, you are in for it because
   you attend here and you put me in for it, too, for if you do anything
   wrong, they are sure to lay all the blame on me! They say--"That is one
   of Spurgeon's people." You are not--I do not acknowledge you as
   yet--but the outsiders have pushed you into the responsibilities of a
   religious profession and you had better go in for its privileges! They
   have laid the Cross of Christ upon you! Do not throw it off! Come on
   and bring that dear motherly wife with you, and Alexander and Rufus,
   too. The Church will be glad to take you all in and, then, as a
   volunteer, you shall bear Christ's Cross! It is, however, a remarkable
   thing that some should first of all be forced into it and then become
   willing followers.

   Last of all, if you and I are cross-bearers, here is a sweet thought.
   Are we carrying a cross which presses us heavily just now? You know you
   are to be like your Master and if so, there will be someone found to
   help you bear your cross. They found Simon to bear the Cross of Jesus
   and there is a Simon somewhere to help you. Only cry to the Lord about
   it and He will find you a friend. If Simon is not forthcoming, I will
   tell you what to do. Imitate Simon. If Simon was what I think he was,
   he became a converted man and, before long, found himself in trouble
   through it. And so he at once went to the Lord in prayer, and said,
   "Lord Jesus I am resting in You, alone. You did give me the honor to
   carry Your Cross once, now, I beseech You, carry mine!"

   This is what I want you to do with your crosses at this time. You that
   have to endure hardness for Christ and are glad to do it, ask Him to
   bear your burden for you! He has borne your sins and, if you will but
   commit your troubles to Him, joy and peace through believing shall
   stream into your souls by His Holy Spirit. God bless you, for Christ's
   sake.

"Feed My Lambs"--a Sunday School Sermon

   (No. 1684)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 15, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
   Jonas, do you love Me more than these? He said unto Him, Yes, Lord; You
   know that I love You. He said unto him, Feed My lambs." John 21:15.

   READ the whole chapter and observe the change of scene. First, they are
   on the lake fishing, casting their nets at Christ's command, and
   dragging to land a multitude of great fishes. They have all come on
   shore and when they have breakfasted, their faces are not turned to the
   sea, but to the pastures on the hillside. These are clothed with flocks
   and the Master says no more about fishermen and fish, but speaks of
   shepherds and sheep. Herein lies a parable--the servants of the Lord
   Jesus are first, fishermen, and then shepherds. The first work of
   Christ's servants is comprised in that commission, "Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature," or, "Launch out into
   the deep and let down your nets for a draught."

   They begin their heavenly vocation as fishers, even as Jesus said to
   them at the first, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
   Their earliest work is to preach the Gospel, which is like the letting
   down of a great seine net, enclosing life of all kinds. They are not to
   make a selection of characters so as to preach only to likely
   persons--that would be comparable to angling--a figure which is used in
   the Old Testament in connection with destruction--and not in reference
   to salvation, even as Amos says, "The Lord God has sworn by His
   holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that He will take you
   away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks."

   In Gospel fishing we let down the big net and thus encompass many of
   all sorts. In the act of preaching the Gospel, all are fish that come
   to the net--the sorting of the good from the bad is to be done another
   day. Our urgent work--I mean yours and mine, my Brothers--is to go out
   into the world and proclaim the blessed Gospel of salvation to all who
   care to hear us. We are to go into every place to which we can gain
   access--"into all the world," "into the streets and lanes of the city,
   into the highways and hedges"--anywhere and everywhere the world over.
   Our one instrument as fishers for Christ is the Gospel of the Grace of
   God. God forbid that we should use any other. May the Lord help us to
   keep to our fishing and may we come and instantly receive Divine
   direction as to how and where to cast the net so that we may have a
   full net, and yet a net unbroken, with which we may fish again.

   After this is done, and while it is being done, another art is to be
   practiced. Fishing is not all, as many seem to think. It is a great
   part of our service and would God it were more attended to, but after
   it has been attended to, shepherding comes in, and is a work of equal
   weight. Our Lord Jesus Christ would have His servants attend to this
   second task with all their hearts. If souls are converted, they have
   been brought up from the depths of sin and the scene changes--we see a
   flock, "the Church of God which He has purchased with His own blood."
   This flock needs as much care as any other, yes, it needs to be tended
   with the utmost labor and watchfulness.

   The Lord Jesus, Himself, is the Good Shepherd who laid down His life
   for the sheep, the Great Shepherd who is brought, again, from the dead
   and the Chief Shepherd under whom He has appointed shepherds to watch
   for the souls of men. He will have those of us whom He calls to His
   service to shepherd those who are converted--leading, protecting,
   feeding, comforting and succoring them. He will call us to account if
   we neglect this charge, for He will require His flock at our hands,
   saying, "Where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?"
   This shepherd work is so important that three times the Savior bids us
   attend to it, saying first, "Feed My lambs," then, "Feed My sheep," or,
   as some old manuscripts have it, "My little sheep," and then, again,
   "Feed My sheep."

   We are to feed the babes in Grace; to shepherd the young men in Christ
   Jesus; and to feed the older ones who feel many growing infirmities and
   need, again, the comforts of their earliest days. Three times over are
   we thus bid! Are we, then, so apt to fail in this? Jesus spoke but once
   to Death, and Lazarus came forth. Are we more deaf than the grave and

   must we be thrice commanded? Let us no longer be disobedient to the
   heavenly mandate! We must never so evangelize the outside mass as to
   forget to fold and feed those within! We are to disciple all nations
   and then to teach them all things whatever Christ has commanded us!

   Not every man that can haul in a net is ready, at once, to tend a
   flock. We need much Grace, for the Lord Jesus Christ spent years in
   most industriously educating the 12, training the 70 and getting ready
   a band of followers who were not only saved, but educated, so as to
   teach others. We must not be indifferent to this matter. The quiet work
   of building up Believers must be steadily pursued, even though those
   who sound a trumpet before them may despise such ministries.

   I shall speak, this morning, upon work within the fold--the feeding of
   the sheep and lambs--and this I shall do in order that I may help our
   beloved Sunday school teachers. This is their day and if I do not seem
   to speak directly or exclusively to them, I hope I shall, nevertheless,
   say much to stimulate and direct them in their invaluable labors. I ask
   for them your most earnest prayers and loving sympathies--and of many I
   would beg a more practical cooperation with them. Concerning this
   shepherding for Christ, let us first note the sphere--"My lambs."
   Secondly, the man for it--one like Simon, son of Jonas. Thirdly, his
   preparation for it. Fourthly, the work itself and, fifthly, the motive
   under which the feeding is to be carried out. Briefly on each point. Oh
   for help from the Spirit of God!

   I. First, think of THE SPHERE. Although in the other instances, Jesus
   says, "Feed My sheep," yet in this first instance, He says, "Feed My
   lambs." To whom does He refer? I think, first, to such as are little in
   Grace. They have but a grain of mustard seed of faith as yet--their
   love is not a flame, but a spark--the leaven of Grace within them has
   begun to work, but all the measures of meal are not yet leavened. The
   spiritual life in these is like a candle newly lit, apparently in
   danger of being suddenly blown out and, therefore, needing great care.

   Weakness is an idea in the word, "lambs," and so, in the Church of God,
   all such as are weak--and, alas, how many there are--all such as are
   doubting, all such as are slenderly instructed, all such as are easily
   bewildered in doctrine, cast down in spirit and apt to be
   staggered--all such, I say, are to be watched over with special care
   and, therefore, Jesus mentions them particularly and separately and in
   the first place. If our kindness should neglect the strong, it would be
   a sad pity, but it might not entail so much damage as if we neglect the
   weak! What says the Apostle? "Comfort the feebleminded; support the
   weak; be patient towards all men."

   In our numbers we always have a few who wear the weeds of spiritual
   widowhood. These are very sincere, but sadly anxious, scarcely knowing
   what full assurance means, but yet true and resolute. Their faith is a
   trembling one, crying, "Lord, I believe; help You my unbelief." Such
   are not to be blamed, nor avoided, nor despised, nor in the least
   degree discouraged. But, inasmuch as we, ourselves, may also be tempted
   with like fears, we are to console them. We ought to know that if we
   are strong, our strength lies not in ourselves, for our own strength is
   perfect weakness and, therefore, we should deal graciously and tenderly
   with the weak of the flock. I think this is the reason why the weak
   were committed to Simon Peter in this particular case--because he had
   been very weak, himself--he had denied his Master through his fears and
   thus he was taught to have compassion on other trembling ones.

   He who is, himself, compassed with infirmities, knows the heart of the
   weaklings. He can enter with sympathy into their doubts and their
   distresses, for he has felt the same. I say, therefore, this morning,
   in the name of the Lord Jesus, to all of you who love Him, "Look well
   to the weak ones of the Church." But I cannot think, as some expositors
   do, that weakness is the main idea in the word, "lambs," for the notion
   of a lamb is not confined to the thought of weakness, since full-grown
   sheep may be weak and lambs may be vigorous. But the most prominent
   thought is that ofyouth. The lambs are the young of the flock, So,
   then, we ought to look specially and carefully after those who are
   young in Divine Grace. They may be old in years and yet they may be
   mere babes in Grace as to the length of their spiritual life and,
   therefore, they need to be under a good shepherd.

   As soon as a person is converted and added to the Church, he should
   become the object of the care and kindness of his fellow members. He
   has but newly come among us and has no familiar friends among the
   saints. Therefore let us all be friendly to him. Even should we leave
   our older comrades, we must be doubly kind towards those who are newly
   escaped from the world and have come to find a refuge with the Almighty
   and His people. Watch with ceaseless care over those newborn babes who
   are strong in desires, but strong in nothing else! They have but just
   crept out of darkness and their

   eyes can scarcely bear the light--let us be a shade to them until they
   grow accustomed to the blaze of Gospel Day. Addict yourselves to the
   holy work of caring for the feeble and despondent.

   Peter, Himself, that morning, must have felt like a newly enlisted
   soldier, for he had, in a sense, ended his public Christian life by
   denying his Lord, and he had begun it, again, when he "went out and
   wept bitterly." He was now making a new confession of his faith before
   his Lord. And Brothers and, therefore, because he was thus made to
   sympathize with recruits, he is commissioned to act as a guardian to
   them. Young converts are too timid to ask for our help and so our Lord
   introduces them to us--and with an emphatic word of command He says,
   "Feed My lambs." This shall be our reward, "Inasmuch as you have done
   it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto Me."

   But surely we must include in this those who have been converted while
   young in years. We thank God exceedingly that we have among us and
   round about us many dear children that already know Christ. We have
   never, as a Church, thought that a certain number of years must have
   passed over a child before it can confess its faith in Christ and be
   received into the Church. It is sometimes said that we teach adult
   Baptism. We do nothing of the sort! We practice Believer's Baptism, and
   baptize all who confess faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whether they
   are children or adults! Our enquiry as to fitness does not refer to
   age, but to faith.

   The number or the fewness of days or years is no consideration,
   whatever, with us! Our question is, "Do you believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ?" If that is fairly answered, we say at once, "What hinders you
   to be baptized?" However young a Believer may be, he should make an
   open confession of his faith and be folded with the rest of the flock
   of Christ. We are not among those who are suspicions of youthful
   piety--we could never see more reason for such suspicions in the case
   of the young than in the cases of those who repent late in life. Of the
   two, we think the latter are more to be questioned than the former, for
   a selfish fear of punishment and dread of death are more likely to
   produce a counterfeit faith than mere childishness would. How much has
   the child missed which might have spoiled it! How much it does not know
   which, please God, we hope it never may know! Oh, how much there is of
   brightness and trustfulness about children, when converted to God,
   which is not seen in elder converts!

   Our Lord Jesus evidently felt deep sympathy with children and he is but
   little like Christ who looks upon them as a trouble in the world and
   treats them as if they must necessarily be either little deceivers or
   foolish simpletons! To you who teach in our schools is given this
   joyous privilege of finding out where these young disciples are who are
   truly the lambs of Christ's flock! And to you, He says, "Feed My
   lambs." That is, instruct such as are truly gracious but young in
   years. It is very remarkable that the word used here for, "feed My
   lambs," is very different from the word employed in the precept, "feed
   My sheep." I will not trouble you with Greek words, but the second,
   "feed," means exercise the office of a shepherd, rule, regulate, lead,
   manage them, do all that a shepherd has to do towards a flock. But this
   first, "feed," does not include all that--it means distinctly feed--and
   it directs teachers to a duty which they may, perhaps, neglect, namely,
   that of instructing children in the faith.

   The lambs do not so much need keeping in order as we do who know so
   much and yet know so little--who think we are so far advanced that we
   judge one another and contend and emulate. Christian children mainly
   need to be taught the doctrine, precept and life of the Gospel--they
   require to have Divine Truth put before them clearly and forcibly. Why
   should the higher doctrines, the doctrines of Grace, be kept back from
   them? They are not, as some say, bones--or if they are bones, they are
   full of marrow and covered with fatness! If there is any doctrine too
   difficult for a child, it is rather the fault of the teacher's
   conception of it than of the child's power to receive it, provided that
   child is really converted to God.

   It is ours to make doctrine simple--this is to be a main part of our
   work. Teach the little ones the whole Truth of God and nothing but the
   Truth, for instruction is the great need of the child's nature. A child
   has not only to live as you and I have, but also to grow, therefore he
   has double need of food, When fathers say of their boys, "What
   appetites they have!" they should remember that we, also, should have
   great appetites if we have not only to keep the machinery going, but to
   enlarge it at the same time. Children in Grace have to grow, rising to
   greater capacity in knowing, being, doing and feeling, and to greater
   power from God. Therefore, above all things, they must be fed. They
   must be well fed or instructed, because they are in danger of having
   their cravings perversely satisfied with error.

   Youth are susceptible to evil doctrine. Whether we teach young
   Christians the Truth of God or not, the devil will be sure to teach
   them error. They will hear of it, somehow, even if they are watched by
   the most careful guardians. The only

   way to keep chaff out of the child's little measure is to fill it to
   the brim with good wheat. Oh that the Spirit of God may help us to do
   this! The more the young are taught, the better--it will keep them from
   being misled. We are specially exhorted to feed them because they are
   so likely to be overlooked. I am afraid our sermons often go over the
   heads of the younger folk, who, nevertheless, may be as true Christians
   as the older ones. Blessed is he that can so speak as to be understood
   by a child! Blessed is that godly woman who, in her class, so adapts
   herself to girlish modes of thought that the Truth of God from her
   heart streams into the children's hearts without let or hindrance!

   We ought, especially, to feed the young because this work is so
   profitable. Do what we may with persons converted late in life, we can
   never make much of them. We are very glad of them for their own sakes,
   but at 70, what remains, even, if they live another 10 years? Train up
   a child and he may have 50 years of holy service before him! We are
   glad to welcome those who come into the vineyard at the 11th hour, but
   they have hardly taken their pruning-hook and their spade before the
   sun goes down--and their short day's work is ended. The time spent in
   training the late convert is greater than the space reserved for his
   actual service. But you take a child-convert and teach him well and, as
   early piety often becomes eminent piety, and that eminent piety may
   have a stretch of years before it in which God may be glorified and
   others may be blessed, such work is profitable in a high degree!

   It is also most beneficial work for ourselves. It exercises our
   humility and helps to keep us lowly and meek. It also trains our
   patience. Let those who doubt this, try it, for even young Christians
   exercise the patience of those who believe in them and are therefore
   anxious that they should justify their confidence! If you want
   big-souled, large-hearted men or women, look for them among those who
   are much engaged among the young, bearing with their follies and
   sympathizing with their weaknesses for Jesus' sake!

   You see the sphere which is presented to your zealous activity. Will
   you not occupy it? Many of you are already engaged in it--see to it
   that you fulfill your high calling--and to the utmost, feed the lambs!

   II. Secondly, let us speak of THE MAN who is to do this. I look upon my
   text as addressed, not to Peter, only, but to those who are like Peter.
   What if I say it is addressed to us all? As servants and lovers of
   Jesus, He says to us, "Feed My lambs." Who should do it? Christ
   selected Simon Peter as a leading man. He was one of the chief of the
   Apostles, if we may use such a word. He was one of the triumvirate that
   led the van--Peter, James and John. But though a leading man, he was to
   feed the lambs, for no man may think himself too great to care for the
   young.

   The best of the Church are none too good for this work. And, dear
   Friends, do not think because you have other service to do, that,
   therefore, you should take no interest in this form of holy work, but
   kindly, according to your opportunities, stand ready to help the little
   ones and to cheer those whose chief calling it is to attend to them. To
   us all this message comes--"Feed My lambs." To the minister and to all
   who have any knowledge of the things of God, the commission is given.
   See to it that you look after the children that are in Christ Jesus.
   Peter was a leader among Believers, yet he must feed the lambs.

   But he was especially a warm-hearted man. Simon Peter was not a
   Welshman, but he had a great deal of what we know as Welsh fire in him.
   He was just the sort of man to interest the young. Children delight to
   gather round a fire, whether it is on the hearth or in the heart.
   Certain persons appear to be made of ice and, from these, children
   speedily shrink away--congregations or classes grow smaller every
   Sunday when cold-blooded creatures preside over them! But when a man or
   a woman has a kindly heart, the children seem to gather readily, just
   as flies in these autumn days swarm on a warm sunny wall. Therefore
   Jesus says to warm-hearted Simon, "Feed My lambs." He is the man for
   the office!

   Simon Peter was, moreover, an experienced man. He had known his own
   weaknesses. He had felt the pangs of conscience. He had sinned much and
   had been much forgiven and now he was brought, in tender humility, to
   confess the love and loveliness of Jesus. We need experienced men and
   women to talk to converted children and to tell them what the Lord has
   done for them, and what have been their dangers, their sins, their
   sorrows and their comforts. The young are glad to hear the story of
   those who have been further on the road than they have. I may say of
   experienced saints--their lips keep knowledge. Experience lovingly
   narrated is suitable food for young Believers, instruction such as the
   Lord is likely to bless to their nourishing in Grace.

   Simon Peter was now a greatly indebted man. He owed much to Jesus
   Christ, according to that rule of the Kingdom--he loves much to whom
   much has been forgiven! Oh, you that have never entered upon this
   service for Christ and yet might do it well, I beseech you, consider
   your obligation to Jesus! The state of our schools at the present
   moment is a

   strong argument for your aid! We have plenty of children and few
   teachers--around this place of worship many schools are doing their
   work in a lame and halting manner for lack of teachers. O you who owe
   so much to Christ, will you not feed His lambs? Ought you not to be
   forward to offer yourselves? Will you refuse Him? Come forward at once
   and say, "I have left this work to younger hands, but I will do so no
   longer. I have experience and I trust I yet retain a warm heart within
   my bosom. I will go and join these workers who are steadily feeding the
   lambs in the name of the Lord!" So far as to the man who is called to
   feed the lambs.

   III. Thirdly, when the Lord calls a man to a work, He gives him THE
   PREPARATION necessary for it. How was Peter prepared for feeding
   Christ's lambs? First, by being fed, himself. The Lord gave him a
   breakfast before giving him a commission. You cannot feed lambs or
   sheep, either, unless you are fed yourself. It is quite right for you
   to be teaching a great part of the Lord's-Day, but I think a teacher is
   very unwise who does not come to hear the Gospel preached and get a
   meal for his own soul. First be fed, and then feed!

   But especially Peter was prepared for feeding the lambs by being with
   his Master. He would never forget that morning and all the incidents of
   it. It was Christ's voice that he heard--it was Christ's look that
   pierced him to the heart! He breathed the air which surrounded the
   risen Lord and this fellowship with Jesus perfumed Peter's heart and
   tuned Peter's speech, that he might afterwards go forth and feed the
   lambs. I commend to you the study of instructive books, but above all I
   commend the study of Christ! Let Him be your library! Get near to
   Jesus. An hour's communion with Jesus is the best preparation for
   teaching either the young or the old.

   Peter was also prepared in a more painful way than that, namely, by
   self-examination. The question came to him thrice over, "Simon, son of
   Jonas, do you love Me? Do you love Me? Do you love Me?" Often the
   vessel needs scouring with self-examination before the Lord can fitly
   use it to convey the Living Water to thirsting ones. It never hurts a
   true-hearted man to search his own spirit and to be searched and tried
   by his Lord. It is the hypocrite who is afraid of the truth which tests
   his profession--he dreads trying discourses and trying meditations--but
   the genuine man wants to know for certain that he really does love
   Christ and, therefore, he looks within him and questions and
   cross-questions himself.

   Mainly, dear Friends, that examination should be exercised concerning
   our love, for the best preparation for teaching Christ's lambs is
   love--love to Jesus and to them. We cannot be priests on their behalf
   unless, like Aaron, we wear their names upon our breasts. We must love
   or we cannot bless! Teaching is poor work when love is gone--it is like
   a blacksmith working without fire, or a builder without mortar. A
   shepherd that does not love his sheep is a hireling and not a shepherd!
   He will flee in the time of danger and leave his flock to the wolf.
   Where there is no love, there will be no life--living lambs are not to
   be fed by dead men!

   See, Brothers and Sisters, we preach and teach love--our subject is the
   love of God in Christ Jesus! How can we teach this if we have no love,
   ourselves? Our objective is to create love in the hearts of those we
   teach and to foster it where it already exists. But how can we convey
   the fire, if it is not kindled in our own hearts? How can we promote
   the flame whose hands are damp and dripping with worldliness and
   indifference, so that he acts on the child's heart rather as a bucket
   of water than as a flame of fire? These lambs of the flock live in the
   love of Christ--shall they not live in ours? He calls them His lambs
   and so they are--shall we not love them for His sake?

   They were chosen in love; they were redeemed in love; they have been
   called in love; they have been washed in love; they have been fed by
   love and they will be kept by love till they come to the green pastures
   on the hilltops of Heaven! You and I will be out of gear with the vast
   machinery of Divine Love unless our souls are full of affectionate zeal
   for the good of the beloved ones! Love is the grandest preparation for
   the ministry, whether exercised in the congregation or in the class.
   Love and then feed! If you love, feed! If you do not love, then wait
   till the Lord has quickened you and lay not your unhallowed hand to
   this sacred service!

   Thus I have described the sphere, the man, and his preparation.

   IV. Let us now consider THE WORK, "Feed My lambs." I have already given
   you the gist of this subject. With the weak of the flock, with the new
   converts in the flock, with the young children in the flock, our
   principal business is to feed. Every sermon, every lesson should be a
   feeding sermon and a feeding lesson. It is of little use to stand and
   thump the Bible and call out, "Believe, believe, believe!" when nobody
   knows what is to believe! I see no use in fiddles and
   tambou-rines--neither lambs nor sheep can be fed upon brass bands!
   There must be doctrine--solid, sound, Gospel doctrine to

   constitute real feeding. When you have meat on the table, then ring the
   dinner bell--but the bell feeds nobody if no food is served up.

   Getting children to meet in the morning and the afternoon is a waste of
   their steps and yours if you do not set before them soul-saving,
   soul-sustaining Truth of God. Feed the lambs--you need not pipe to
   them, nor put garlands round their necks--but feed them. This feeding
   is humble, lowly, unostentatious work. Do you know the name of a
   shepherd? I have known the names of one or two who follow that calling,
   but I never heard anybody speak of them as great men. Their names are
   not in the papers, nor do we hear of them as a trade with a grievance,
   claiming to be noticed by the legislature. Shepherds are generally
   quiet, unobtrusive people. When you look at the shepherd, you would not
   see any difference between him and the plowman, or the coal miner. He
   plods on uncomplainingly through the winter and in the early spring he
   has no rest, night or day, because the lambs are needing him--this he
   does year after year--and yet he will never be made a Knight of the
   Garter, nor even be exalted to the peerage, albeit he may have done far
   more useful work than those who are floated into rank upon their own
   beer barrels.

   So in the case of many a faithful teacher of young children! You hear
   but little about him, yet he is doing grand work for which future ages
   will call him blessed. His Master knows all about him and we shall hear
   of him in that Day-- perhaps not till then. Feeding the lambs is
   careful work, too, for lambs cannot be fed on anything you please,
   especially Christ's lambs. You can soon poison young Believers with bad
   teaching. Christ's lambs are all too apt to eat herbs which are
   deleterious--it is necessary that we are cautious where we lead them.
   If men are to take heed what they hear, how much more should we take
   heed what we teach? It is careful work, the feeding of each lamb,
   separately, and the teaching of each child, by itself, the Truth of God
   which it is best able to receive.

   Moreover, this is continuous work. "Feed My lambs," is not for a
   season, but for all time. Lambs could not live if the shepherd only fed
   them once a week. I reckon they would die between Sunday and
   Sunday--therefore, good teachers of the young look after them all the
   days of the week as they have opportunity--and they are careful about
   their souls with prayer and holy example when they are not teaching
   them by word of mouth. The shepherding of lambs is daily, hourly work.
   When is a shepherd's work over? How many hours a day does he labor? He
   will tell you that in lambing-time he is never done. He sleeps when he
   can, taking much less than forty winks, and then rousing himself for
   action. It is so with those who feed Christ's lambs--they rest not till
   God saves and sanctifies their dear ones.

   It is laborious work, too. At least he who does not labor at it will
   have a terrible account to render. Do you think a minister's life is an
   easy one? I tell you that he who makes it so will find it hard enough
   when he comes to die. Nothing so exhausts a man who is called to it, as
   the care of souls, and so it is, in measure, with all who teach--they
   cannot do good without spending themselves. You must study the lessons.
   You must bring forth something fresh to your class. You must instruct
   and impress. I have no doubt you are often driven very hard for
   material and wonder how you will get through the next Lord's-Day.

   I know you are sorely pressed, at times, if you are worth your salt.
   You dare not rush to your class unprepared, to offer to the Lord that
   which costs you nothing. There must be labor if the food is to be
   wisely placed before the lambs, so that they can receive it. And all
   this has to be done in a singularly choice spirit--the true shepherd
   spirit is an amalgam of many precious Graces! He is hot with zeal, but
   he is not fiery with passion. He is gentle and yet he rules his class.
   He is loving, but he does not wink at sin. He has power over the lambs,
   but he is not domineering or sharp. He has cheerfulness, but not
   levity; freedom, but not license; solemnity, but not gloom. He who
   cares for lambs should be a lamb, himself, and, blessed be God, there
   is a Lamb before the Throne of God who cares for all of us and does so
   the more effectually because He is in all things made like unto us!

   The Shepherd spirit is a rare and priceless gift. A successful pastor
   or a successful teacher in a school will be found to have special
   characteristics which distinguish him from his fellows. A bird, when it
   is sitting on its eggs, or when the little ones are newly-hatched, has
   about it a mother-spirit, so that it devotes all its life to the
   feeding of its little ones. Other birds may be taking their pleasure on
   the wing, but this bird sits still the whole day and night, or else its
   only flights are to provide for gaping mouths which seem to be never
   filled!

   A passion has taken possession of the bird and something like it comes
   over the true soul-winner! He would gladly die to win souls! He pines,
   he pleads, he plods to bless those on whom his heart is set. If these
   could but be saved, he would pawn half his Heaven for it! Yes, and
   sometimes, in moments of enthusiasm, he is ready to barter Heaven alto-

   gether to win souls and, like Paul, he could wish himself accursed, so
   that they were but saved! This blessed extravagance many cannot
   understand because they never felt it--may the Holy Spirit work it in
   us, so we shall act as true shepherds towards the lambs. This, then, is
   the work, "Feed My lambs."

   V. Lastly, let us consider THE MOTIVE. Our Lord Jesus heard Peter's
   assurance of love and then He said, "Feed My lambs." The motive for
   feeding the lambs was to be his Master's and not his own. Had Peter
   been the first Pope of Rome and had he been like his successors, which,
   indeed, he never was, surely it would have been fitting for the Lord to
   have said to Him, "Feed your sheep. I commit them to you, O Peter,
   Vicar of Christ on earth." No, no, no! Peter is to feed them, but they
   are not his, they are still Christ's. The work that you have to do for
   Jesus, Brothers and Sisters, is in no sense for yourselves. Your
   classes are not your children, but Christ's. This is not my Church, but
   Christ's.

   The exhortation which Paul gave was, "Feed the Church of God," and
   Peter, himself, wrote in his Epistle, "Feed the flock of God which is
   among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but
   willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind." Let these lambs
   turn out what they may, the Glory is to be to the Master and not to the
   servant! And the whole time spent, labor given and energy put forth is,
   every particle of it, to redound to His praise whose these lambs are.
   Yet while this is a self-denying occupation, it is sweetly honorable,
   too, and we may attend to it feeling that it is one of the noblest
   forms of service!

   Jesus says, "My lambs: My sheep." Think of them and wonder that Jesus
   should commit them to us! Poor Peter! Surely when that breakfast began,
   he felt awkward. I put myself into his place and I know I should hardly
   have liked to look across the table at Jesus, as I remembered that I
   denied Him with oaths and curses. Our Lord desired to set Peter quite
   at his ease by leading him to speak upon his love which had been so
   seriously placed in question. Like a good doctor, He puts in the knife
   where the anxiety was festering--He enquires, "Do you love Me?" It was
   not because Jesus did not know Peter's love, but in order that Peter
   might know for sure and make a new confession, saying, "Yes, Lord; You
   know that I love You."

   The Lord is about to hold a tender controversy with the erring one for
   a few minutes that there might never be a controversy between Him and
   Peter again. When Peter said, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You,"
   you half thought that the Lord would answer, "Ah, Peter, and I love
   you." But He did not and yet, He did. Perhaps Peter did not see His
   meaning, but we can see it, for our minds are not confused as Peter's
   was on that memorable morning. Jesus did, in effect, say, "I love you
   so that I trust you with that which I purchased with My heart's blood.
   The dearest thing I have in all the world is My flock. Look, Simon, I
   have such confidence in you; I so wholly rely on your integrity as
   being a sincere lover of Me, that I make you a shepherd to My sheep.
   These are all I have on earth, I gave everything for them, even My
   life, and now, Simon, son of Jonas, take care of them for Me."

   Oh, it was "kindly spoken." It was the great heart of Christ saying,
   "Poor Peter, come right in and share My dearest cares." Jesus so
   believed Peter's declaration that He did not tell him so in words, but
   in deeds! Three times He said it, "Feed My lambs; feed My sheep; feed
   My sheep," to show how much He loved him. When the Lord Jesus loves a
   man very much, He gives him much to do or much to suffer. Many of us
   have been plucked, like brands, from the burning, for we were "enemies
   to God by wicked works." And now we are in the Church among His friends
   and our Savior trusts us with His dearest ones! I wonder, when the
   prodigal son came back and the father received him, whether when
   market-day came, he sent his younger son to market to sell the wheat
   and bring home the money. Most of you would have said, "I am glad the
   boy is back, but at the same time, I shall send his elder brother to do
   the business, for he has always stuck by

   me."

   As for myself, the Lord Jesus took me in as a poor prodigal son and it
   was not many weeks before He put me in trust with the Gospel, that
   greatest of all treasures--this was a grand token of love! I know of
   none to excel it. The commission given to Peter proved how thoroughly
   the breach was healed--how fully the sin was forgiven--for Jesus took
   the man who had cursed and sworn in denial of Him and bade him feed His
   lambs and sheep! Oh, blessed work, not for yourselves, and yet for
   yourselves! He that serves himself shall lose himself, but he that
   loses himself does really serve himself after the best possible
   fashion! The master motive of a good shepherd is love. We are to feed
   Christ's lambs out of love. First, as a proof of love. "If you love Me,
   keep My Commandments." If you love Me, feed My lambs. If you love
   Christ, show it and show it by doing good to others, by laying yourself
   out to help others that Jesus may have joy of them.

   Next, as an inflowing of love. "Feed My lambs," for if you love Christ
   a little, when you begin to do good, you will soon love Him more! Love
   grows by active exercise. It is like the blacksmith's arm which
   increases in strength by wielding the hammer. Love loves till it loves
   more and it loves more till it loves more--and it still loves more till
   it loves most of all--and then it is not satisfied, but aspires after
   enlargement of heart that it may copy yet more fully the perfect model
   of love in Christ Jesus, the Savior! Besides being an inflowing of
   love, the feeding of lambs is an outflow of love. How often have we
   told our Lord that we loved Him when we were preaching? And I do not
   doubt you teachers feel more of the pleasure of love to Jesus when you
   are busy with your classes than when you are by yourselves at home.

   A person may go home and sit down and groan out--

   "'Tis a point I long to know Oft it causes anxious thought,"

   and wipe his forehead and rub his eyes, and get into the dumps without
   end. But if he will rise up and work for Jesus, the point he longs to
   know will soon be settled, for love will come pouring out of his heart
   till he can no longer question whether it is there! So let us abide in
   this blessed service for Christ that it may be the delight of love, the
   very ocean in which love shall swim, the sunlight in which it shall
   bask! The recreation of a loving soul is work for Jesus Christ! And
   among the highest and most delicious forms of this heavenly recreation
   is the feeding of young Christians--endeavoring to build them up in
   knowledge and understanding--that they may become strong in the Lord.
   The Lord bless you, dear fellow-laborers in the Sunday school, from
   this time forth and for evermore! Amen.

God's Non-Remembrance of Sin

   (No. 1685)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 22, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I, even I, am He that blots outyour transgressions for My own sake,
   and will not remember your sins." Isaiah 43:25.

   "For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
   more."

   Jeremiah 31:31.

   "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and
   their iniquities will I remember no more." Hebrews 8:12.

   "And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." Hebrews 10:17.

   You see these texts are all alike in their declaration that the Lord
   will not remember His people's sins. I have taken four of them to make
   the basis of my sermon firm as adamant. It is written, "In the mouth of
   two or three witnesses every word shall be established." Here then, you
   have Isaiah and Jeremiah, two Old Testament saints, affirming the same
   thing--is this not enough? Added to these, you have the author of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, who, in all probability, was Paul, and these
   three agree in one. Their united testimony is that Jehovah, the Lord
   God, will forgive the sins of His people, and do it in so complete a
   way that He will remember their iniquities no more. Now, if I did not
   preach at all, but merely gave you these four texts to consider, I
   think the service ought to be full of comfort to all who know their
   guiltiness and are anxious to obtain mercy.

   That article in the creed is too little thought of--"I believe in the
   forgiveness of sin." Men flippantly declare that they believe it when
   they are not conscious of any great sin of their own. But when his
   transgression is made apparent to a man, and his iniquity comes home to
   him, it is quite another matter. Does any unregenerate person believe
   in the forgiveness of sin? I think not. No man, in sincerity, believes
   it until God, the Holy Spirit, has taught him its truth, and has
   written it upon his heart. No revealed Truth of God is more generally
   doubted and disbelieved than this, the plainest of all revelations,
   that the Lord is gracious and full of compassion and ready to pass by
   the iniquities of His people! Men disbelieve for themselves and doubt
   it as to others when the matter is fairly tested.

   When a man's sins are set before him in the light of God's Countenance,
   his first instinct is to fear that they are altogether unpardonable. If
   he does not state his unbelief in so many words, yet, in the secret of
   his soul, that dreadful conviction takes hold upon him and darkens
   every window of hope. He looks to the Law of God and while he looks in
   that direction, he will certainly conclude that there is no pardon, for
   the Law knows nothing of forgiveness. It is, "Do this and you shall
   live. Disobey and you shall die." To convict and to condemn is all the
   Law was sent for. By the Law is the knowledge of sin and by its power
   sinners are shut up in the prison house of despair, from which only the
   Lord Jesus can deliver us.

   What the Law asserts, the understanding, also, supports, for within the
   awakened man there is the memory of his past offenses--and on account
   of these his conscience passes judgment upon his soul--and condemns it
   even as the Law does. "God must punish wickedness," is the utterance of
   conscience. "He were not the judge of all the earth if He did not do
   right and if He does right, He must visit my transgressions with the
   threatened penalty." Thus, the thunder of Sinai is echoed by
   conscience. Meanwhile, many natural impressions and instincts assist
   and increase the clamors of conscience, for the man knows within
   himself, as the result of observation and experience, that sin must
   bring its own punishment.

   He perceives that is a knife which cuts the hand of him that handles
   it; a sword that kills the man who fights with it. He feels that he
   cannot, himself, readily pass by offenses committed by his fellow men
   and so he concludes that the Lord cannot willingly forgive. That part
   of the hardness of his heart goes to deepen the conviction that God
   will not pass by his transgression and he is, therefore, terribly
   dismayed and hopeless of mercy. Meanwhile the devil comes in with all
   the horrors of the infernal Pit and threaten speedy destruction!

   That same evil spirit who once pictured sin in glowing colors and set
   before the sinner the pleasureableness of unrighteousness, now comes in
   and turns accuser, forestalls the final sentence and hardens the man's
   heart by the assurance that there is no hope! Bunyan very aptly
   pictures Diabolus, when he was attacking the town of Mansoul, as making
   Captain Past-Hope unfurl the red colors which were carried by Mr.
   Despair. And he also speaks of the roaring of the tyrant's train, which
   sounded forth terribly, especially by night, so that the men of Mansoul
   had always in their ears the sound of Hell-fire! Hell-fire! And all
   this to keep them from submitting to their gracious Prince.

   Thus, for once, the devil craftily cooperates with the Law of God and
   with conscience--these would drive men to despair, but Satan would go
   further and compel them to despair as touching the Lord, Himself, so as
   to believe that pardon for transgression is quite impossible. The
   convinced sinner is able to believe that mercy may be shown to others,
   but as for himself, he signs his own death warrant and labors under the
   full persuasion that the acts of God's mercy can never extend to him.
   No stocks can hold a man so fast as his own guilty fears! The hangman's
   whip never tortured men so cruelly as does an awakened conscience.

   With the desponding I shall try to deal at this time and may the Holy
   Spirit, the Comforter, help me to console them.

   I. Our first theme is this--THERE IS FORGIVENESS. Our four texts all
   teach us that doctrine with great distinctness. Is not that a sublime
   assurance, "I, even I, am He that blots out your transgressions for My
   own sake, and will not remember your sins"? Does not Paul put it
   sweetly as from God's own mouth, "Their sins and iniquities will I
   remember no more." Remember how the Psalmist, in the 130th Psalm makes
   this a special note of thanksgiving--"There is forgiveness with You
   that You may be feared." Let us adore the Lord because He delights in
   mercy!

   For a minute or two let me try to prove--may it be to your
   satisfaction, O you despairing ones--that there is forgiveness. This
   appears, first, in the treatment of sinners by God, inasmuch as He
   spares their forfeited lives. When our first parents had transgressed,
   they came at once under desert of penalty. The Lord visited the garden
   and convinced the offenders of their transgression. But, instead of
   then and there pronouncing their doom and casting them forever away
   from His Presence, He talked to them of a certain Seed of the woman
   that should bruise the serpent's head. The curse which must fall, fell
   obliquely, descending, first, upon the soil and secondarily upon the
   man--first upon the serpent and more gently on the woman, whose very
   pain and travail were to bring forth deliverance for the race and
   vengeance on the enemy.

   The man and the woman each had a separate sentence in labor and in
   childbirth, but, oh, how mild were these sentences compared with what
   they might have been! How joyful is the fact that, over all, there was
   the sparing hand of God letting them live and His cheering voice
   promising them ultimate deliverance! Would the Lord thus have spared
   them if He had not meant to show mercy? Would He not have crushed a
   sinful race, even in its egg, and have blotted out forever those of
   whom, not long after, it agonized Him that He had made them upon the
   earth? Assuredly the Lord meant pardon when He tarried to enquire,
   "Adam, where are you?" In the morning of human history the Lord's
   long-suffering displayed itself and gave promise of larger Grace!

   The same is true of you and of me. If God had no pardons, would He, not
   long ago, have sent us down as cumberers of the ground? We sinned early
   in life--perhaps we sinned grossly in our youthful days--doing evil
   with great wantonness and willfulness according to the obstinacy of our
   hearts. Why did He not, then, say, "I will take these away. They will
   only go from bad to worse and they will infect others with their vices.
   Therefore will I root them out lest they become injurious to those
   about them and a curse to future generations"? But no, even yonder
   blasphemer was not smitten to death when he imprecated damnation upon
   himself! Yon Sabbath-breaker was not cut down when he made the Lord's
   holy Day to be an opportunity for wickedness! He that lied was not made
   a dreadful example of judgment like Ananias and Sapphira! He that stood
   out to oppose God was not swallowed up quickly like Korah, Dathan and
   Abiram! No, all these have been spared, spared to this day--and to what
   end, do you think? Surely, the long-suffering of God is repentance and
   repentance is mercy! God waits long because He wills not the death of
   any, but that they turn to Him and live.

   In the second place, why did God institute the Ceremonial Law if there
   were no ways of pardoning transgression? Why the bullocks and the lambs
   offered in sacrifice? Why the shedding of blood, if God did not intend
   to blot out sin? Why the burnt offerings in which God accepted man's
   gift, if man could not be accepted? Assuredly He could not be accepted
   if regarded as guilty! Why the peace offering in which God feasted with
   the offerer and the two united in feeding upon the one sacrifice? How
   could this be, unless God intended to forgive and enter into fellowship
   with men? I confess I cannot understand the institution of the
   priesthood and sacrifice unless mercy was intended thereby.

   Again, why was there a Tabernacle for God to dwell with His people if
   He would not forgive their iniquities? How could He dwell with
   unforgiven men? Why was there a Mercy Seat? Why was there a High Priest
   ordained from among men who should enter into the Holy Place and make a
   typical atonement? Does not a type imply the existence of that which is
   typified? Why the scapegoat to take away sin in symbol, if sin cannot
   be taken away in reality? Why the burning of the offering outside the
   gate in order that sin might be put away from God's people, if it could
   not be put away? Certainly the evident design of the whole Mosaic
   economy was to reveal to man the existence of mercy in the heart of God
   and the effectual operation of that mercy in washing away sin!

   Further than this, dear Friends, if there were no forgiveness of sin,
   why has the Lord given to sinful men exhortations to repent? Why does
   the Lord say, "Turn you to your God: keep mercy and judgment and wait
   upon the God continually"? Why does He say to men, "O Israel, return
   unto the Lord your God; for you have fallen by your iniquity. Take with
   you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto Him, Take away all iniquity
   and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips"?
   Why does He cry, "Therefore also now, says the Lord, turn you even to
   Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
   mourning: and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
   Lord your God"? Is it not because it can be added, "for He is gracious
   and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents Him of
   the evil"?

   Is it not true, even as Elihu said, "He looks upon men, and if any say,
   I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me
   not; He will deliver his soul from going into the Pit, and his life
   shall see the light"? If sin could not be pardoned, why, under the
   Gospel, are we bid to urge men to repent of sin, to confess their sins,
   and to forsake them? Might not the Lord have said, "Let them alone: it
   is of no use their repenting: no mercy is in reserve for them,
   therefore let them continue in their iniquity till their own ways
   destroy them"? Even John the Baptist's cry of, "Repent! Repent!" is a
   note of hope to transgressors. The times of their ignorance, God has
   winked at, but now under Gospel rule, He commands all men everywhere to
   repent, because repentance has the promise of the blotting out of sin.

   If you will think of it, you will see that there must be pardon in the
   hands of God, or why the institution of religious worship among us to
   this day? Why are we allowed to pray in secret, if we cannot be
   forgiven? What is the value of prayer, at all, if that first and most
   vital favor of forgiven sin is utterly beyond our reach? Why are we
   allowed to sing the praises of God? Why has the Holy Spirit given us
   the Book of Psalms? Why are we bid to use Psalms and hymns and
   spiritual songs? God cannot accept the praises of unforgiven men!
   Worshippers must be clean before they draw near to His altar with their
   incense! If, then, I am taught to sing and give thanks to God, it must
   be because "His mercy endures forever!"

   Does God expect the condemned to praise Him? Will He shut us up in the
   prison for certain death and yet expect us to chant hallelujahs to His
   praise? It cannot be so! The very ordaining of prayer and praise
   indicates a design of mercy to the sons of men. Why, dear Friends, are
   there two special ordinances of God's house if, in that house, there is
   no remission of sin? Why the Baptism of Believers? It signifies our
   death in Christ to sin. But how so if we cannot be dead to sin? It
   signifies, typically, the washing away of sin. But to what end and to
   what use, except of delusion, if there is no washing away of sin by
   God's abounding Grace? What does the Lord's Supper mean, that eating of
   bread with God and drinking of the cup in familiar fellowship with Him?
   Why that showing forth the death of Christ until He comes if, in that
   death there is no virtue and if God cannot deal with men on terms of
   love? Surely the ordinances of the Lord's house are full of invitation
   to such as bemoan their transgressions and are willing to come to Jesus
   for pardon and renewal!

   The very existence of a Church, of a Gospel ministry and the toleration
   of Divine worship are promises and prophecies of the forgiveness of
   sins! What assurance of pardon lies in the ordaining, sealing and
   ratifying of the Covenant of Grace! The first Covenant left us under
   condemnation, but one main design of the New Covenant is to bring us
   into justification. Why a New Covenant at all, if our unrighteousness
   can never be removed? Is not this the tenor of the Covenant

   as stated in our second text? Let the Holy Spirit, Himself, be a
   witness unto us as we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews, "This is the
   covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, I
   will put My Laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write
   them; and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
   What do You say to this, O despairing one? Will you dream that God can
   lie and even make a Covenant merely to mock poor sinners with a
   groundless hope? Oh, think not so, for there is forgiveness!

   Furthermore, my Brothers and Sisters, why did Christ institute the
   Christian ministry and send forth His servants to proclaim His Gospel?
   For what is the Gospel but a declaration that Christ is exalted on high
   to give repentance unto Israel and remission of sins? Is not this a
   great promise--that God will put away our transgressions upon our
   believing in Jesus Christ, our Great Sacrifice? "I believe in the
   forgiveness of sins," for if it were not so, then has the Cross become
   null and void and the death of the Only-Begotten a hideous mistake! To
   what end those bleeding wounds? To what end that crown of thorns? To
   what end that cry, "Eloi, Eloi, lama Sabachthani"? To what end that
   shout of, "It is finished"? The Cross is the grandest of realities and
   the core of its meaning is the removal of sin by Him who bore our sins
   in His own body on the tree! Assuredly there is a fountain opened for
   sin and for uncleanness--heavy-laden Soul--that fountain is opened for
   you!

   Now, once in the history of the world has the Son of God appeared to
   put away sin by the Sacrifice of Himself-- poor guilty one, if you
   believe your guilt was put away by His atoning death! Why are we so
   earnestly commanded to preach this Gospel to every creature, if the
   creature hearing it and believing it must, nevertheless, still lie
   under his sin? Our Lord Jesus has commanded that repentance and
   remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations,
   beginning at Jerusalem--why is this, if there is no remission of sins?
   The genuine love of God is manifested in His desire that to the utmost
   ends of the earth it should be proclaimed, "The blood of Jesus Christ
   His Son cleanses us from all sin." "All manner of sin and blasphemy
   shall be forgiven unto men."--

   "Carry, carry, you winds, the story,

   And you, you waters, roll,

   Till like a sea of Glory

   It spreads from pole to pole!"

   There is forgiveness! Through the name of Jesus, whoever believes in
   Him shall receive remission of sins. "Through this Man is preached unto
   you the forgiveness of sins." "He that believes in Him is justified
   from all things from which he could not be justified by the Law of
   Moses." Paul says, "God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you," and it
   is even so.

   Now, you do not need any more arguments, but if you did, I would
   venture to offer this. Why are we taught in that blessed model of
   prayer which our Savior has left us, to say, "Forgive us our debts as
   we forgive our debtors," or, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
   them that trespass against us"? It is evident that God means us to give
   a true and hearty absolution to all who have offended us. He does not
   intend that we should play at forgiveness, but should really, and from
   our hearts, most freely and sincerely forgive all those who have done
   evil towards us in any way. Yes, but then He has linked with that
   forgiveness, our prayer for mercy, teaching us to ask that He would
   forgive us as we forgive them. If, then, our forgiveness is real, so is
   His! If ours is sincere, so is His! If ours is complete, so is
   His--only much more so, inasmuch as the Great God of All is so much
   more gracious than we poor, fallen creatures ever can be!

   A star of hope shines upon the sinner in the Lord's Prayer in that
   particular petition, for it seems to say, "There is a real, true and
   hearty forgiveness of God toward you, even as there is in your heart a
   real, true and hearty forgiveness of those who offend you." Mind you do
   really and heartily forgive others, for your own pardon is to be
   measured thereby. See well to this. The best of all arguments is
   this--God has actually forgiven multitudes of sinners. We have read in
   Holy Scripture of men who walked with God and had this testimony, that
   they pleased God. But they could not have pleased God if their sins
   still provoked Him to wrath--therefore He must have put their sins
   away. Those saints of the Old Testament who were evidently Divinely
   favored; with whom God held sweet communion; to whom He gave marvelous
   power in prayer; in whom He showed the majesty of faith--all those must
   have been forgiven men--for the Lord could not have walked with them,
   dwelt in them, worked by them and displayed His Glory in them if He had
   not forgiven them.

   But I need not talk of past ages! There are many sitting among you,
   this day, who, if you will ask them, will tell you that they enjoy a
   clear sense of forgiven sin. They remember well that happy day when
   Jesus washed their sins away! And their state of peace, of joyful
   privilege and of expectant hope is, to them, intensely delightful--and
   may be to you an evi-

   dent testimony that remission of sin is a real experience--and is known
   among God's people at this day. Sin can still be put away! The spot
   which seemed indelible can be washed out till all is white as snow
   through the precious blood of Christ! Our texts, all of them, declare
   it, saying with one breath, "I will forgive their iniquity and I will
   remember their sin no more." May God the Holy Spirit make use of these
   arguments for the comfort of every seeking sinner here and of many more
   who shall read this discourse.

   II. Secondly, THIS FORGIVENESS IS TANTAMOUNT TO FORGETTING SIN. This is
   a wonder to me, a wonder of wonders--that God should say that He will
   do what, in some sense, He cannot do--that He should use speech which
   includes an impossibility and yet that it should be strictly true as He
   intends it. God's pardon of sin is so complete that He, Himself,
   describes it as not remembering our iniquity and transgression. I have
   said that there is an impossibility in it and so there is, because the
   Lord cannot, in strict accuracy of speech, forget
   anything--forgetfulness is an infirmity and God has no infirmities!

   The Lord does not exercise memory as you and I do. We recall the past,
   but He has no past--all things are present with Him. God sees
   everything at once by an intuitive perception--the past, the present,
   the future are before Him at a glance. We may not speak, except after
   the manner of men, of the Lord God as having memory, and yet how
   blessed it is that He should, Himself, use the speech which is current
   among ourselves and represent Himself after the manner of a man, and
   then say, "Your sins and their iniquities will I remember no more
   forever." He wishes us to know that His pardon is so true and deep that
   it amounts to an absolute oblivion--a total forgetting of all the
   wrong-doing of the pardoned ones!

   You know what we do when we exercise memory. To speak popularly, a man
   lays up a thing in his mind--but when sin is forgiven, it is not laid
   up in God's mind. A certain matter has happened and we remember
   it--storing it away in our memory. We read that, "Mary kept all these
   things, and pondered them in her heart." We make a kind of storeroom of
   our memory and there things are preserved, like fruit in autumn, stored
   up to be used, by-and-by. We reckon a man to be fortunate who has a
   good memory, so that he can lay by things in his brain where he can get
   at them in time of need. The Lord will not do this with our sins! He
   will not store them in His archives! He will not give them house-room.
   The record of our sin shall not be laid up in the Divine treasury--we
   shall not cry with Job, "My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and
   You sew up my iniquity."

   As for the ungodly, their sins are written with an iron pen and the
   measure of their iniquity is daily filling, till it is poured out upon
   their own heads! Their sins have gone before them to the Judgment Seat
   and are crying aloud for vengeance. As for God's people, their case is
   otherwise--the Lord imputes not their iniquities to them and does not
   treasure them up against a day of wrath. Of course the Lord remembers
   their evil doings, in the sense that He cannot forget anything. But
   judicially as a Judge, He forgets the transgressions of the pardoned
   ones. They are not before Him in court, and come not under His official
   sight.

   In remembering, men also consider and meditate on things, but the Lord
   will not think over the sins of His people. A grievous wrong is apt to
   engross our thoughts. It often casts its shadow upon the mind and you
   cannot get rid of it. I have known persons brood over an offense as a
   hen gathers her chickens under her wings. The wrong grows worse as they
   think it over. They carefully observe the offense from different points
   of view and, whereas they were indignant at first, they nurse their
   wrath and make it so hot that it turns to fury! At first they would
   have been satisfied with an apology, but when they have brooded over
   the injustice, it seems so atrocious that they demand vengeance on the
   offender. The merciful Lord does not do so to those who repent. No, for
   He says, "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."

   The Great Father's heart is not brooding over the injuries we have
   done--His infinite mind is not revolving within itself the tale of our
   iniquities. Ah, no! If we have fled to Christ for refuge, the Lord
   remembers our sin no more! The record of our iniquity is taken away and
   the Judge has no judicial memory of it. Sometimes you have almost
   forgotten a thing and it is quite gone out of your mind--but an event
   happens which recalls it so vividly that it seems as if it were
   perpetrated but yesterday. God will not recall the sin of the pardoned.
   I am blest, thank God, with a splendid memory for forgetting what
   anybody says or does against me. I forget it, not because I try to do
   so, but because I cannot help it and, therefore, I claim no credit for
   it. The other day when I was speaking kindly with a person, I was
   reminded by an-

   other that this man had done me a great injustice years ago. I had no
   recollection of it and when it was brought before my mind, I was
   grateful that I had forgotten it because I could honestly treat the man
   as a friend, as indeed he now is.

   The occurrence was banished from my mind till my memory was refreshed
   about it. The gracious Lord can never be refreshed in His memory
   concerning the sins of His people--they are gone past recall--"As far
   as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions
   from us." Neither will there be a dark day when, all on a sudden, the
   Lord will say, "I have been treating this man graciously, but now I
   recollect what He did in former years and I must change My tone. I
   recollect that oath he swore, that criminal indulgence into which he
   fell, that drunkenness, that piece of dishonesty, that awful hypocrisy.
   And though I have been gentle with him, I must, in justice, change My
   course and punish him." No! No! This will never be the case with our
   forgiving Lord!

   "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." "No more!"
   Let those words go echoing through the chambers of despair--"NO MORE!"
   Is there not music in the two syllables? God will never have His memory
   refreshed. The transgressions of His people are dead and buried with
   Christ and they shall never have a resurrection! "I will not remember
   their sins." Furthermore, this not remembering means that God will
   never seek any further atonement. The Apostle says--"Now where
   remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin." The one
   Sacrifice of Jesus has made an end of sin! Under the old Law they
   offered an expiatory sacrifice, but they must necessarily offer it
   again and again. There was remembrance of sins made every year on the
   Day of Atonement--but now the Blessed One has entered, once and for
   all, within the veil and has put away sin forever by the Sacrifice of
   Himself, so that there remains no more a need of a sacrifice for sins!

   The Lord will never demand another victim, nor seek another expiatory
   offering. The sufferings of Jesus are so all-sufficient that no
   Believer shall be made to suffer penalty for His unrighteousness. Look
   at that fiction of "purgatory" which is coming back into the English
   Church and is hankered after by certain Dissenters. They are beginning
   to believe in a modified form of "purgatory" and this is a dark sign of
   the times. "Purgatory" has always paid the Pope well--it is the fattest
   province of his dominions and has furnished his treasury plentifully.
   But how can God's people go to "purgatory"? For if they go there at
   all, they go there for sins which God does not remember and so He
   cannot give a reason for sending them there! I have no authentic
   communication by which to describe "purgatory," but by Romish report it
   is a terrible place.

   Now, if true Believers go there, then God either does remember their
   sins, which He says He will not do, or else He punishes them for sins
   which He does not remember! Did you ever hear of a judge sending a man
   to prisons for a crime which the judge did not remember? Does God
   forgive and forget and yet punish? Do not, I pray you, believe, in any
   shape or form, in a middle state in which sin can be atoned for or the
   condition of a man altered. When you die, you shall either go to Heaven
   or to Hell--and that straight away--and your state, in either case,
   will be fixed, and fixed eternally without the possibility of a change.
   This doctrine is the cornerstone of Protestantism and if that is taken
   away, there is a vacuum left in which all the evil doctrines of the
   papacy will speedily find a nest. Stand to the Truth of God revealed in
   Scripture and to that only! The wicked shall go away unto everlasting
   punishment and the righteous unto eternal life. If you are forgiven,
   God will never remember your sins--so that in no shape or form shall
   you ever have to make an atonement for them.

   Again, when it is said that God forgets our sins, it signifies that He
   will never punish us for them. How can He, when He has forgotten them?
   Next, that He will never upbraid us with them--"He gives liberally and
   upbraids not." How can He upbraid us with what He has forgotten? He
   will not even lay them to our charge! See what Ezekiel says--"All his
   transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto
   him." The Apostle bravely demanded, "Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect?" Shall God do it? It is God that justifies," how
   then, can He accuse? Shall Christ do it? He is the Judge, but He cannot
   accuse, for, "it is Christ that died, yes, rather that is risen again,
   who sits at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."
   Shall Jesus intercede for us and yet accuse us? Shall there come sweet
   waters and bitter waters out of the same fountain? No, that cannot be!
   The Lord has forgotten our sins and, therefore, He can never lay them
   to our charge.

   Once more, when the Lord says, "I will not remember their sins," what
   does it mean but this--that He will not treat us less generously on
   account of our having been great sinners. You that have been the chief
   of sinners, He will not put you in the second class of Christians and
   treat you with a sort of second-rate love. He will not even remember
   that you

   have sinned, but treat you as if you had been perfectly innocent and
   were totally clear from all iniquity. He will not remember your faults.
   Why, look how the Lord takes some of the biggest sinners and uses them
   for His Glory! Is not this a proof that He has ceased to remember their
   sins? When I think of Peter standing up on the day of Pentecost and
   3,000 being converted under His first sermon, I think no more of
   Peter's failure and the cock crowing! I can see that the Lord has
   forgotten His threefold denial and placed Him in the front to be a
   soul-winner.

   But the Lord Jesus not only uses His people, He honors them greatly.
   What honors He put upon the Apostles, those men that forsook Him and
   fled in the hour of His passion! He says to each of them, "I will not
   remember your sins," for He makes them leaders of His hosts, though
   they have been a parcel of runaways and have forsaken their Master in
   His hour of peril. See how condescendingly the Lord has taken some,
   here present, and has honored them, and given them to bring
   blood-bought souls to Himself in proof that He has wholly forgotten
   their sins! And then, think about that He should adopt us into His
   family--we that were His enemies--rebellious and children of the devil!
   Is it not wonderful that He puts us among the children and even makes
   us "heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ"?

   Surely, when that testament was written by which He made us heirs with
   Christ, it was clear proof that the Father did not, any more, remember
   our iniquities! To put down such blacks in the same testament with His
   own dear Son and then to say, "I will receive them graciously and love
   them freely," this is surprising Grace! Brothers and Sisters, infinite
   Love has made us to be "accepted in the Beloved," comely with His
   comeliness which He has put upon us; precious in His sight and
   honorable, jewels in His case and a crown of glory unto Him! Is not
   this the sign of perfect forgiveness? With His whole heart He watches
   over us to do us good. Surely, with blessing He blesses us, yes, and
   makes us blessings! We shall have Grace on earth and glory in Heaven!
   He will seat us, as objects of His Grace in Heaven, not in an inferior
   place in the suburbs or behind the door--but He will cause us to sit
   with Jesus on His Throne, even as He has sat down with the Father on
   His Throne. We shall be with Him where He is and behold His Glory, and
   be forever peers of the heavenly realm.

   Surely all this proves that He has altogether blotted out our sins and
   has determined to treat us as if we had been perfectly innocent.
   Indeed, the saints are without fault before the Throne of God, for they
   have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb!
   The Believer's sins no longer exist and, "if they are searched for,
   they shall not be found; yes, they shall not be, says the Lord."--

   "Who is a pardoning Godlike Thee? And who has Grace so rich and free?"
   Oh, that God would comfort His mourners by this sermon! I have a notion
   in my head that if when I was under the sense of sin I could have heard
   this subject handled, I should have found liberty at once! Though I had
   been hidden away in the back seat of the gallery out of sight, if only
   I had heard of such mercy as this, I should have jumped at it! I cannot
   tell how it might have been, for I do not remember hearing so plain a
   declaration of boundless Grace.

   Oh, how I pray and hope that the Lord will lead some poor soul to
   accept this unspeakable blessing! Come, you consciously guilty ones,
   and touch the silver scepter of your reigning Savior! He is ready to
   forgive--the Atonement is made and accepted--the Savior who died has
   risen again! Come to Him and be at peace! Oh, that the blessed Spirit
   may lead you to feel the power of the reconciling blood!

   ' III. I finish with the blessed fact that FORGIVENESS IS TO BE HAD.
   How is it to be had? Let me speak briefly and you catch up every word
   and think over it. Forgiveness is to be had through the atoning blood.
   Why does God forget our sin? Is it not on this wise? He looks upon His
   Son, Jesus, bearing our sin. Did you ever think of what God the Father
   sees in Jesus on the Cross? Why you and I have seen enough to make us
   break our hearts, but when the Father saw His only-begotten Son
   suffering, even to death, it made such an infinite impression upon His
   great soul that He forgot the sins for which His Son gave His life!

   That new thing coming in, the most wonderful thing that God has on His
   heart, the death of the Only-Begotten, made a clean erasure in the
   eternal memory of all the transgressions of those for whom Christ died.
   In such way does He describe to us the mystery of forgiving love. Dear
   hearts, get under the shadow of the Redeemer's Cross! Trust Jesus
   Christ, now, and that blood is, then and there, applied to you, and
   your sins shall be remembered no more, forever, because He remembers
   His Son's suffering in your place and stead. Next, remember that this
   forgetfulness of God is caused by overflowing mercy. God is love--"His
   mercy endures forever"--and He desired vent for His love. His great
   heart was

   filled with a desire to display the Grace which pervaded His Nature--He
   must be gracious and He would be gracious-- and because of that Divine
   resolve, He cast our sins behind His back.

   Come, then, if you wish to have your sins forgiven! Come and bow before
   the mercy of God! Plead not merit but mercy! Do not dare to approach
   the Lord on terms of Law, but draw near on terms of Grace. Here is a
   word for you which was said by an eminent saint when approaching his
   God--"Lord, I am Hell, but you are Heaven." Here is a full description
   of yourself and, as blessed a description of God as may be! Come, then,
   poor Hell-deserving one and hide yourself in the Heaven of everlasting
   love--and it shall be a haven of peace to you forever! How does God
   forget sin? Well, it is through His everlasting love! He loved His
   people before they fell and He loved His people when they fell. "I have
   loved you," says He, "with an everlasting love"--and when that great
   love of His had led Him to give His Son Jesus for His people's ransom,
   it made Him also forget His people's sins.

   The Lord so loved His chosen that He said, "He has not beheld iniquity
   in Jacob, neither has He seen perverseness in Israel." Having shown His
   love by the gift of Jesus, that love has covered a multitude of sins.
   Do you not see, then, that if you want to enter into this pardon, this
   forgetfulness of sin, you must come to God on the terms of His free
   love and ask Him to forgive you because His name is Love? "Have mercy
   upon me, O God, according to Your loving kindness; according to the
   multitude of Your tender mercies blot out my transgressions."

   Again, God forgets His people's sins because of the complacency He has
   in them as renewed and sanctified creatures. When He hears their cries
   of repentance; when He hears their declarations of faith; when He sees
   the love which His Spirit has worked in them; when He beholds them
   growing more and more like His dear Son, He delights in them! His joy
   is fulfilled in them. He is well-pleased with them and communes
   lovingly with them. He observes their signs of Grace and accepts
   them--and remembers their iniquities no more! Oh, then, you must come
   to God and ask Him to change you and to renew you, that He may have
   delight in you! Come and beseech Him that you may be born again and
   made new creatures in Christ Jesus, for this must be if you are to be
   forgiven. There cannot be pardon of sin where there is not a renewal of
   the heart--and that must come from God by His sovereign Grace alone.

   Oh, you that would have pardon of sin, come for it, this morning, in
   God's appointed way. "Repent," He says! That is, be sorry for your
   sins. Change your mind about them and hate them, though once you loved
   them. Then confess them, for He says, "only acknowledge your iniquity."
   Get home and mourn your transgression before your offended Lord,
   sincerely, fully and with deep regret--and then He will take away your
   sins, for it is written he that confesses and forsakes his sins shall
   find mercy. This is His way, then. Acknowledge that you are guilty, but
   ask that you may be guilty no more. Chief of all, "Believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ and you shall be saved," and that saving includes an act
   of amnesty and oblivion as to all your sinful thoughts, words, and
   acts!

   Trust the Lord Jesus Christ! That is the pith of it. Trust yourself in
   the hands that were nailed to the Cross for you! Trust yourself to the
   love of the heart which was pierced with a spear and forthwith there
   came out blood and water! Have you done this? Then you are, even now,
   forgiven! Your sin has gone, it is cast into the depths of the sea! Go
   down those aisles with your heart dancing within you for delight, for
   there is nothing laid against you since you are a Believer in the Lord
   Jesus! God imputes not iniquity to the man who has cast Himself on the
   Savior. Go, therefore, but never forget your sin, nor the mercy which
   has forgiven it!

   Always repent and always praise the Lord. Honor the forgetfulness of
   God in not remembering your faults and, from now on, tell this blessed
   news to everyone you see--there is forgiveness, such forgiveness as was
   never heard of until God, Himself, revealed it by saying of His people,
   "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." God bless
   you dear Friends, from now on and forever. Amen.

With the Disciples on the Lake of Galilee

   (No. 1686)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 6, 1881,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The men marveled, saying, What manner of Man is this, that even the
   winds and the sea obey Him!" Matthew 8:27.

   "And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of
   Man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?" Mark 4:41.

   THIS story of the storm upon the lake is wonderfully full of spiritual
   interest. Not only does it, literally, show to us the Divine power of
   our blessed Master in lulling the storm, rendered the more conspicuous
   by being placed, side by side, with the human weakness which made Him
   sleep in the ship upon a pillow, but, spiritually, it is a kind of
   ecclesiastical history, a miniature outline of the story of the Church
   in all ages. No, the teaching ends not when you have read the incident
   in that light--it also contains a suggestive forecast of the story of
   every man who is making the spiritual voyage in company with Jesus.

   Notice, first, how it is a kind of ecclesiastical history. There is
   Christ in the vessel with His disciples. What is that but a Church with
   its pastor? We see in the Church a vessel bearing a rich cargo,
   steering for a desired haven and fitted out for fishing on the road,
   should fair opportunity occur. Her being upon a sea shows her to be
   here below, subject to trial, suffering, labor and peril. I scarcely
   know of any more apt picture of a Church than a ship upon the
   treacherous Galilean sea with Jesus and His disciples sailing in it.

   After a while a storm comes--this we may safely reckon upon. Whatever
   ship makes a fair voyage, with a favoring wind, the ship of the Church
   of Jesus Christ never will. She has her calms, but these last not
   forever--her sail is sure to be weather-beaten at one time or
   another--and the occasions are seldom far apart. The vessel which has
   Jesus for its Captain is destined to feel the tempest. Christ has not
   come to send peace on earth, but a sword. This is His own declaration
   and He knows His own intent. Every sail of the good ship which bears
   the flag of the Lord High Admiral of our fleet must be beaten with the
   wind and every plank in her must be tried by the waves.

   To Christ's Church there are many storms and some of them of the most
   terrible character. Of heresy--ah, how near to wrecking has she been
   with the false doctrines of Gnosticism, Arianism, Popery and
   Rationalism! Of persecution she has constant experience, but sometimes
   exceedingly vehement has the hurricane been. In the early stages of
   Church history, the pagan persecutions of Rome followed thick and fast
   upon each other and when Giant Pagan had emptied out all his fury,
   there came a worse tyrant whose magical arts raised hurricanes of wind
   against the good ship--there sat, at Rome, a harlot who persecuted the
   saints exceedingly--being drunk with their blood.

   Then there raged a cyclone which almost drove the boat out of the water
   and drenched and well-near drowned her crew--a fierce cyclone beat upon
   the royal vessel, so that the waves threatened to swallow her up! Tears
   and blood covered the saints as with a salt and crimson spray! Hers was
   no pleasure trip--she went forth like the lifeboat, fashioned for the
   purpose of riding out the storm. The true ship of the Lord was, and is,
   and will be in a storm until the Lord shall come--and then there shall
   be for it no further wave of trial, but the sea of glass forever!

   Note, again, that while this storm was roaring worse and worse, the
   Lord was in the ship, but He seemed to be asleep. So has it often been.
   No Providence delivered the persecuted. No marvelous manifestations of
   the Spirit scattered the heresy. The Christ was in the Church, but He
   was in the back part, with His head upon a pillow, asleep. You all know
   the portions of Church history which this illustrates.

   Then came distress. The people in the vessel began to be alarmed. They
   were afraid that they should utterly perish. And do you wonder at it
   when the peril was so great? That distress led to prayer. Mighty prayer
   has often been produced

   by mighty trial. Oh, how slack has the Church been in the presentation
   of her spiritual offering until the Lord has sent fire upon her and
   that fire has seemed to kindle her frankincense so that it has begun to
   smoke towards Heaven! Prayer was produced by distress and prayer
   brought distress to an end!

   Then the Master rose up and displayed His power and Godhead. You know
   how He has done so in reformations and revivals time after time. He has
   chided the unbelief of His trembling saints and then He has hushed the
   winds and the waves--and there has been a time of peace for His poor,
   weather-beaten Church--a period free from bloodshed and heresy, an era
   of progress and peace. The Church has a history which has many a time
   repeated itself. If you take an interest in the navigation of that
   wondrous vessel which carries Christ and all His chosen, you will never
   have to complain of lack of incidents!

   But I think I said that the story of the storm upon the lake is an
   admirable emblem of the spiritual voyage of every man who is bound for
   the fair havens in company with Jesus. We are with Christ, happy with
   Him and sailing pleas-antly--will this last? Right speedily comes a
   storm. The ship rocks and reels. She is covered with the waves. It
   looks as if our poor rowboat will sink to the bottom! Yet Jesus is in
   our hearts and that is our safety. We are not saved by seamanship, but
   by having on board the Lord Paramount who rules all winds and
   waves--and never yet lost a vessel that bore the Cross at its masthead!

   Sometimes within our hearts He seems to be asleep. We hear not His
   voice; we see but little of His face--His eyes are closed and He,
   Himself, is hidden out of sight. He has not altogether left us, blessed
   be His name, but He appears to be asleep. Ah, then the ship rocks,
   again, and we reel, again, and we wonder that He can still sleep! Then
   are we driven in awe at alarm to prayer, to which we ought to have
   betaken ourselves long before! It may be that we have been busy with
   ropes and tackle, strengthening the mast, furling the sail, doing all
   kinds necessary work and, therefore, leaving undone the most necessary
   work of all, namely, seeking out the Master and telling Him the story
   of our peril.

   We pray not till we are forced to our knees, sad sinners that we are!
   The boat will go down! She will go down! And now it is that we, also,
   go down to the cabin and begin to wake Him up with, "Master, save us!
   We perish!" Then you know what happens--how the gentle rebuke passes
   over our spirit and we are humbled. But the grander rebuke is heard by
   the winds and waves--and they are quieted and sleep at the Master's
   feet--and in us and around us there is a great calm. Oh, how profound
   the peace! How blessed the stillness!

   We were about to say, "Would God it would last on forever," but as yet
   tranquility cannot be perpetual. Our perils of waters will be sure to
   repeat themselves. Often we go down to the sea in ships and do business
   in great waters, so that we see the works of the Lord and His wonders
   in the deep. Hear how a poet sings the story--

   "Fierce was the wild billow Dark was the night! Oars labored heavily
   Foam glimmered white! Trembled the mariners Peril was near Then said
   the God of God-- 'Peace!Itis I!' Ridge of the mountain wave, Lower your
   crest! Wail of Euroclydon, Be you at rest! Sorrow can never be--
   Darkness must fly-- Where says the Light of Light-- Peace!Itis I!'
   Jesus, Deliverer! Come You to me! Soothe You my voyaging Over life's
   sea! You, when the storm of death

   Roars sweeping by,

   Whisper, O Truth of Truth!--

   'Peace! It is I!'"

   On this occasion I will not further call your attention to the storm,
   or to the calm, but I beg you to observe the feelings of the disciples
   about the whole matter. The text says that, "The men marveled, saying,
   What manner of Man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him!"
   God evidently thinks much of His people's inward feelings, for they are
   recorded here and in many other cases. The report of what these poor
   fishermen felt is as carefully made as the record of what their Lord
   and Master said, since this was necessary to set forth the intent and
   purpose of their Lord's utterances. God often regards the external
   action as a mere husk, but the feeling of His people is the innermost
   kernel of their life-story and He prizes it.

   Some men practice introspection so much that they grow, at last, to
   make a kind of fetish of their inward feeling. This is wrong. Yet there
   is an error on the other side in which we cease to make conscience of
   our feelings and think them to be a matter of no consequence, as if
   there could be real life without feeling. I will cry up faith as much
   as anyone--but there is no need to depreciate all the other Graces, and
   especially all the emotions, in order to do honor to faith! We may
   honor the heir and yet see no reason for slaying all the rest of the
   royal seed. We must both feel aright and believe aright--and it is
   sometimes good for us to have a lesson about how to feel towards our
   Lord Jesus Christ.

   Though feeling must be secondary to faith, yet it is far from being
   unimportant. At this time I shall principally talk about three feelings
   towards Christ. First, the men marveled. We will dwell upon
   that--marveling at Christ's work. Secondly, if you will turn to Mark,
   the fourth chapter and the 41st verse, you will see that Mark describes
   the feeling of the men as, fearing "exceedingly." That shall be our
   second head--awe-stricken at His Presence. Thirdly, we see them, in our
   text, admiring His Person, for they said, "What manner of Man," or,
   more correctly, "What kind of Person is this, that even the winds and
   the sea obey Him!"

   I. First, then, MARVELING AT HIS WORK. May I ask you to indulge, for a
   little while, the feeling of wonder? You believe in Jesus Christ and
   you are saved. Salvation comes not by wondering, but by believing. But
   now, having been saved, having passed from death unto life--and having
   been preserved for years upon the sea of life in the midst of many
   storms and, at this moment enjoying a great calm and restfulness of
   spirit, I invite you to marvel. What wonderful things Jesus has done
   for me! It is in my power, if I choose, to waste my time in reading
   romances, but I care nothing for them, for my own life is to me more
   romantic than romance!

   The story of God's goodness to me is more thrilling than any work of
   fiction could possibly be! I am speaking to some here who I am sure
   will join with me in acknowledging that there is a freshness, a
   novelty, a surprise power about the dealings of God with us which we do
   not meet with anywhere else! Well do we sing in our hymn--

   "I need not go abroad for joys-- I have a feast at home,"

   and we can also add that we need not go abroad for wonders, for we have
   a perfect museum at home in our own experience! John Bunyan, when he
   was describing the experience of his pilgrim, said, "Oh, world of
   wonders! I can say no less." And so it is. The life of the godly man,
   on the God side of it, as he receives Grace from Jesus, is a gallery of
   heavenly art! He is an exhibition of Divine skill and power, a
   wonderland of mercy--

   "Still has my life new wonders seen

   Of loving kindness rare!

   A monument of Grace I stand,

   Your goodness to declare."

   Let us think for a minute or two of the parallel between us and these
   disciples as to wonderment. Consider, first, that the instantaneous and
   profound calm was contrary to Nature. The Galilean Lake lies in a deep
   hollow, much below the level of the ocean, and in the sides of the
   cliffs and hills which shut it in, there are valleys and openings which
   act as funnels, down which, blasts of cold air from the mountains often
   rush upon a sudden. When the time of storm is really on, the Lake of
   Galilee is not tossed about like an ordinary open sea, but is rent,
   torn, heaved up and almost hurled out of its bed by down-driving
   hurricanes and twisting whirlwinds! No sailor knows which way the wind
   will blow except that it blows all ways at once and particularly
   downwards--as if, with a direct downdraft from Heaven, it blows vessels
   into the water--and soon, changing its course, lifts them into the air!

   Any mariner who is not used to that strange, wild sea, would soon lose
   his head and despair of life. It is like a boiling cauldron--the
   spirits of the vast deep stir it to its bottom! Yet this billowy lake,
   in a moment, was turned to glass by the words of Jesus--a fact far more
   wonderful to witness than to read about! Such a change in the
   uproarious elements was altogether contrary to Nature and, therefore,
   "the men marveled." Now, Beloved, look back upon what your life has
   been. I do not know exactly where you begin your life story. Some
   commence in the slime pits of Sodom--in vice and drunkenness. Others
   begin with wandering on the dark mountains of infidelity, or among the
   hogs and sloughs of Phari-seeism and formality.

   However it may have been, it is a miracle that you should have been
   made to fall at Jesus' feet and cry out for mercy through His precious
   blood! That you should give up all trust and confidence in self and, at
   the same time, should turn away from favorite lusts which you once
   reveled in, is such a wonder that nobody would have believed it, had it
   been prophesied to them! Certainly you never would have believed it,
   yourself--and yet it has taken place--and other unlooked-for changes
   have followed it. Why, you have lived, since then, in a way that would
   have been once condemned by yourself as utterly absurd! Had an Oracle
   informed you of it, you would have ridiculed its forecast. "No," you
   would have said, "I shall never be that! I shall never feel that! I
   shall never do that!"

   And yet, it has been so with you. The boiling cauldron of your nature
   has been cooled down and quieted--and an obedient calm has succeeded
   rebellious rage. Is it not so? I can only say that if your religion has
   never produced a wonder, I wonder that you believe in it! If there is
   not something about you, through Divine Grace, which quite surprises
   yourself, I should not be amazed if, one of these days, you wake up and
   find that you have been self-deceived! Far above Nature are the ways of
   Grace in men! And if you know them, they have produced in you what your
   natural temperament and your worldly surroundings never could have
   produced. There has been fire where you looked for snow, and cool
   streams where you expected flames. A growth of good wheat has been seen
   where Nature would have produced nothing but thorns and briars. Where
   sin abounded, Grace has much more abounded, and your life has become
   the theater of miracles and the home of wonders!

   These men marveled, next, because the calm was so unexpected by reason.
   The ship was near going to pieces! A gust of wind threatened to lift
   her right out of the water and the next threatened to plunge her to the
   bottom of the sea! The weary fishermen certainly did not look for a
   calm--there were no signs of such a gift! When they said, "Master, we
   perish," I do not know what they thought their Lord would do, but they
   assuredly never dreamed that He would stand up in the back part of the
   ship, and say, "Winds and waves, what are you doing? Your Master is
   here. Be still." That was beyond their nautical experience and their
   fathers had never seen such wonders in their day. They could not hope
   that in a moment they should be in a profound calm!

   Now, may I ask you to wonder a little at what the Lord has done for
   you? Has He not done for you what you never expected? To speak for
   myself, I never reckoned upon standing here to preach to thousands of
   God's people. When I was first brought to Jesus I had no such hope. Why
   should I be taken from the school and from the desk to lead a part of
   His flock? I wonder more and more that by His Grace I am what I am!
   Some of you, when you sit at the Communion Table, may well feel that
   the most wonderful thing about it is that you should find a welcome
   place at the Lord's own festival. Did some of you expect, a year ago,
   that you would be here, now, on a Thursday night, listening to a talk
   about Jesus

   Christ?

   Why, you hardly know how you got here! You can scarcely tell the way by
   which the Lord has led you to be a lover of the Gospel. Look at your
   inner feelings, as well as your outward position--are you not often
   made the subject of desires, of longings, of groanings and, on the
   other hand, of enjoyments, of sweet and precious endearments, of high
   and gracious expectations which utterly surprise you as you remember
   what you used to be? Are you not "like them that dream" when you think
   over the Lord's loving kindness? And if others say, "the Lord has done
   great things for you," does not your heart chime in with all its bells
   and ring out notes of joy, "The Lord has done great things for us, of
   which we are glad"? Come, indulge your wonder! Admire and marvel at the
   exceeding Grace of God towards you in working contrary to Nature,
   contrary to all reasonable expectations and bringing you to be His dear
   and favored child! Marvels of mercy, wonders of Grace belong unto God
   Most High!

   Besides this, the idea of a storm which should immediately be followed
   by a great calm was a strikingly new experience. These fishermen of the
   Galilean Lake had never seen it after this fashion before. We read in
   the Old Testament of

   some, to whom it was said, "You have not gone this way before," and
   certainly the same might have been said to these disciples. "You have
   been in storms, but you never before, in your lives, were one minute in
   a storm and the next in a calm." It must have been enough to make them
   weep for joy, or, at least, it must have led them to hold up their
   hands in glad astonishment! The deliverance worked by their Lord was so
   fresh, so altogether new that marveling was natural!

   Well, now, Brothers and Sisters, to come back to ourselves, again--have
   you not often experienced that which has astounded you by its novelty?
   Are not God's mercies new every morning? I address some of you who have
   been 40 or 50 years in the ways of God--do you not find a continual
   freshness in the manifestations of God's goodness to you, both in
   Providence and Grace? Let me ask you, has religious life been to you
   like mounting a treadmill, monotonous, wearisome, uniform? If so, there
   is something wrong about you, for while we live near to God, we dwell
   under new heavens and walk upon a new earth! When a man travels through
   the Alps on a bright sunshiny day, all things are as new, as though
   born that morning--that drop of dew on the grass--he never saw before!
   That drifting cloud has newly arrived upon the scene. Never before has
   the traveler seen the face of Nature radiant with the same smile as
   that which now delights him.

   Has it not been so with you in the journey of life? Have not all things
   become new and remained new since you were born anew? Has not Grace
   been heaped upon Grace, so that each new experience has excelled its
   predecessor? Still have I beheld fresh beauties in my Master's face,
   fresh glories in my Master's Words, fresh assurance of His faithfulness
   in His Providence, fresh joy in my Master's Spirit as He has dealt
   graciously with my soul! I know that it is so with you and I want you
   to marvel at it, that God should take so much trouble to manifest
   Himself to poor creatures that are not worth His treading on--that He
   should devise a thousand things most rare and new for such
   insignificant insects of a day as we are. Glory be to His blessed name,
   it may well be said of us, "The men marveled and said, What manner of
   Person is this who deals so with His people?" "Who is a God like unto
   You? What is man that You are mindful of Him? And the son of man that
   you visit him?" These three things made the disciples wonder.

   There was another. I should think that it was a great marvel to them
   that a calm was sent so soon after the storm. Man needs time, but God's
   Word runs very quickly. Man travels with weary feet--the Lord rides
   upon a cherub and does fly, yes, He flies upon the wings of the wind!
   The particles of air and the drops of water were all in confusion
   through the storm, rushing as if chaos had come, again, rising in
   whirlwinds and falling in cataracts! Yet they did but see the face of
   their Maker and they were still! In one single instant there was a
   calm! Have not you and I experienced instantaneous workings of Divine
   Grace upon our spirits? It may not be so with all, but some of us, at
   the first instant of our faith, lost the burden of sin in a moment! Our
   load was all gone before we knew where we were. The change from sorrow
   to joy was not worked in us by degrees, but in a moment the sun leaped
   above the horizon and the night of our soul was over.

   Has it not been so since? We have been, in the midst of God's people,
   as heavy as lead and without power to enjoy a Truth of God, or to
   perform a holy act. The hymns seemed a mockery and the prayer an empty
   form--and yet, in a single moment, the rod of the Lord has touched the
   rock and the waters have flowed forth--and by the very means of Grace
   which seemed so dull and powerless, we have been enlivened and
   comforted! We have blessed the Lord that we ever came to the place. I
   do not know how it is that we undergo such sudden changes. Yes I do--it
   is because God works all good things in us and He is able to
   accomplish, in an instant, that which we could not effect in a year! He
   can, in a moment, change our prison into a palace and our ashes into
   beauty. He can bid us put off our sackcloth and put on the wedding
   garments of delight. As in the twinkling of an eye, this corruptible
   shall put on incorruption, so in an instant our spiritual death can
   blossom into heavenly life! This is a great wonder. Go and marvel at
   what the Lord has so speedily done for you.

   And then, to think that it should have been so perfect! When a storm
   subsides, the sea is generally angry for hours, if not for days. A
   great wind at Dover, yesterday, would make the Channel rough for some
   time. But when our Lord Jesus makes a calm, the sea forgets her raging
   and smiles at once! In fact, "He makes the storm a calm, so that the
   waves are still." The winds hush all their fury and are quiet in an
   instant when He bids them rest. And oh, when the Lord gives joy and
   peace and blessedness to His people, He does not do it by halves! "When
   He gives quietness, who, then, can make trouble?" There is no such
   thing as a half-blessing for a child of God. The Lord gives Him
   fullness of peace--"the peace of God which passes all understanding."
   He causes him to enjoy quiet, through believing, and He enables him to
   rejoice in tribulation, also, for tribulation works blessing to the
   souls of men.

   I feel that I cannot speak as I could wish, but I shall finish this
   division of the discourse by saying that one point of wonder was that
   the calm was worked so evidently by the Master's Words. He spoke and it
   was done. He poured no oil upon the waters. His will was revealed in a
   Word and that will was Law. Not an atom of matter dares to move if the
   Divine fiat forbids--the sovereignty of Jesus is supreme--and His Word
   is with power. Now, dear Friend, I know that there must have been very
   much that is wonderful in your life as a Christian, but do not think
   yourself the only partaker of such wonderment! Let us all sit down and
   enquire, each one, "Why is this to me? Why me, Lord? How can such great
   Grace be shown to me? And how can the Son of God stoop to look at me
   and take me into marriage union with Himself and promise that I shall
   live because He lives--that I shall reign because He reigns?"

   Sit down, I say, and believingly marvel, and marvel, and marvel, and
   never leave off marveling! And let me drop one little word into your
   ear. Is there something that you need of God concerning which unbelief
   has said that it is too wonderful to be expected? Let that be the
   reason why you shall expect it! There is nothing to a Christian so
   probable as the unexpected--and there is nothing which God is so likely
   to do for us as that which is above all we ask or even think! God is at
   home in wonderland! If what you need is a commonplace thing, perhaps it
   may not come. But if it strikes you as a marvel, you are in a fit state
   of heart to honor God for it and you are likely to receive it!

   Do not think that because between you and Heaven, if you reach it,
   there will be a giant causeway of marvels, therefore you will never get
   there! But, on the contrary, conclude that the God who began to save
   you by so great a miracle as the gift and death of His own dear Son,
   will go on to perfect your salvation even if He has to fling into the
   sea a thousand heavens to make stepping stones for you to tread upon so
   you can reach His Presence. "He that spared not His own Son, but freely
   delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not, with Him, also freely
   give us all things?" Therefore expect wonders!

   These men marveled--expect to keep on marveling till you get to
   Heaven--and to keep on marveling when you are in Heaven and throughout
   eternity! Wonder will be a principal ingredient of our adoration in
   Heaven! We--

   "Shall sing with wonder and surprise His loving kindness in the skies."
   I have been somewhat long on this first head. I will therefore give you
   a little, and only a little, upon the second.

   II. Let us now see how the disciples were AWE-STRICKEN AT OUR LORD'S
   PRESENCE. Mark says that "the men feared greatly." They feared greatly
   because they found themselves in the Presence of One who had stilled
   the winds and the waves! Brothers and Sisters, it is well to cultivate
   that holy familiarity which comes from nearness to Jesus and yet we
   ought always to be humbled by a sense of that nearness. Permit me to
   remind the boldest Believer that our loving Lord is still God over all!
   He is to be honored and reverenced, worshipped and adored by all who
   draw near to Him. However much He is our Brother, He says, "You call me
   Master and Lord, and you do well, for so I am."

   He is all the greater because of His condescension to us and we are
   bound to recognize this. Whenever Jesus is near, the feeling of holy
   awe and solemn dread will steal over true disciples. I am afraid of
   that way of being so familiar with Christ as to talk of Him as, "dear
   Jesus" and, "dear Lord," as if He were some Jack or Harry that we might
   pat on the back whenever we liked. No, no. This will never do! It is
   not such language as men would use to their prince--let them not, thus,
   address the King of kings! However favored we may be, we are but dust
   and ashes--and our spirit must be chastened with reverence.

   When Jesus is near us, we ought to exceedingly fear because we have
   doubted Him. If you had been suspicious of a dear friend and had
   indulged hard thoughts about him and, all of a sudden you found
   yourself sitting in the same room with him, you would feel awkward,
   especially if you understood that he knew what you had said and
   thought. Oh, you will feel ashamed of yourself, my Brothers and
   Sisters, if Jesus shall draw near to you! The wisest thing you can do
   in such a case is to say, "My Master, my Lord, since You favor me with
   Your Presence, I will first fall at Your feet and confess that I
   doubted You; that I thought that the stormy wind would swallow up the
   vessel and that the waves would devour both You and me. Forgive me,
   Master, forgive me for having thought so evil of You."

   Whenever we are near to Christ, one of the first feelings should be
   that of great humiliation. Let us fall at His feet and confess how ill
   we have thought of Him. Brethren, we have been so foolish as to fear
   His creatures, paying to them a sort of worship of fear, as if they had
   more power to harm than Jesus had to help! We clothe wind and sea with
   attributes which belong only to God--and look upon our trials as if
   they tried the Lord, too--and vanquished Him because they

   vanquish us. Are we not, because of this, smitten with dread in the
   Presence of the Christ? And then the next feeling should be--since He
   has come to me, this Mighty One who has worked such marvels for me, let
   me try to order myself aright in His Presence.

   I notice whenever the Lord Jesus Christ is very present in this
   congregation how carefully everybody sings. I notice about tune, time
   and tone a difference from the singing which is usual and even from
   that singing which comes of having an acquired skill in music. Though
   it may seem a trifle, yet I cannot help observing that when people come
   to the Communion Table, as a matter of routine they frequently behave
   roughly, walking noisily and looking about, or else they sit like
   statues, with a chill propriety of posture and vacancy of countenance.
   But you will notice that fellowship with Jesus affects the glance of
   the eyes, the thoughts of the soul and, consequently, the movements of
   the body. When a man is truly conscious that Jesus, the Wonder-Worker
   is near, he fears exceedingly.

   If ever you say to Jesus, "You know that I love You," mind you, put,
   "Lord," before it--"Lord, You know all things"--for He is still your
   Lord. Where Jesus is, there is godly fear, which is, by no means, the
   same as slavish fear. Every true child has a reverence for his father.
   Every true daughter has a loving respect for her mother. So is it with
   us towards our Lord Jesus. We owe so much to Him and He is so great and
   so good--and we are so little and so sinful-- that there must be a
   blessed sense of holy awe whenever we come before Him. Indulge it.
   Indulge it now! You know how John puts it--"When I saw Him, I fell at
   His feet as dead."

   Why, that is the man who leaned His head on the bosom of Christ! Yes,
   that is the man who fell at His feet as dead. If your head has never
   leaned upon the bosom of the Lord, I should not wonder if you can hold
   it up in His Presence! But when it has once lain there, in confiding
   love, reposing upon boundless Mercy, then that head of yours will lie
   in the dust uncrowned if God has honored it--for it will be your
   delight to cast your crown at His feet and give Him all the Glory! O,
   reign forever, King of Kings and Lord of Lords! Conquer me, my Lord!
   Subdue me perfectly! Make dust of me beneath Your feet! If You shall be
   but the tenth of an inch the higher for my downcasting, Oh, my Master,
   and my Lord, with joy I would shrink to nothing before You, that You
   may be All in All! May this be your feeling and mine. The men feared
   exceedingly--let us fear, also, after a believing sort.

   III. Now to close. The third thing is ADMIRING THE PERSON OF Jesus, for
   these men who marveled, and who feared exceedingly, admired the Person
   of Him who had set them free from the storm, saying, "What manner of
   Person is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?" Come, let us
   admire and adore the Nature of Christ which is altogether beyond our
   comprehension! The winds and the sea obeyed Him though He had slept
   like other men. When His head was that of an infant, the crown of the
   universe was about His brow! When He was in the carpenter's shop, He
   was still the Creator of all worlds! When He went to die upon the
   Cross, a myriad of angels would have come to rescue Him if He had but
   willed it. Even in His humiliation He was still the Son of the Highest,
   God over all, blessed forever!

   Now that He is exalted in Heaven, do not forget the other side of the
   question--believe that He is just as much Man, now, as when He was
   here--as truly a Brother of our race as He is God over all, blessed
   forevermore. Let us now give our hearts to admiration of Him in His
   complex Nature which is beyond comprehension. He is my next of kin and
   yet my God--at once my Redeemer and my Lord! We may each one cry with
   Job, "I know that my next of kin lives, and that He shall stand in the
   latter day upon the earth. And though, after my skin, worms devour this
   body, yet in my flesh shall I see

   God."

   Because He lives as my Kinsman--there is the sweetness of it and
   because He is my God--there is the Glory of it! He is both tenderly
   compassionate for my infirmities and gloriously able to overcome them.
   He is a complete Savior because He is both Human and Divine. Come, my
   Soul, bow down in wonder that God should send such a Savior as this to
   you! A person asked me the other day whether I had seen a book
   entitled, "Sixteen Saviors." I answered--"No, I have not and I do not
   want to know of 16 saviors. I am perfectly satisfied with One." If all
   who dwell in Heaven and earth could be made into saviors and the whole
   were put together, you might blow them away as a child blows away
   thistledown! There is this one Savior, the Son of Man, and yet the
   mighty God--and He cannot be moved! Joy then, my Brothers and Sisters,
   and rejoice in the Nature of your blessed Lord!

   Next, rejoice in His power which has no limit, so that even the winds
   and the waves obey Him. The winds--can they have a master? The waves
   that cast their spray upon the face of princes--can they acknowledge a
   sovereign? Yes, the most fickle of elements and the most unruly of
   forces are all under the power of Jesus! Joy and rejoice in this.
   Little, as

   well as great, yon Atlantic that divides the world and that little drop
   in the basin of Gennesaret are alike in the hands of Jesus! The power
   of God is seen in a falling mountain when it crashes village, but it is
   as truly present when the seeds are scattered from the pod of the
   gorse, or a rose leaf falls upon the garden walk. God is seen when an
   angel flashes from Heaven to earth and is He not seen when a bee flits
   from flower to flower?

   Jesus is the Master of the little as well as of the great! Yes, He is
   King of all things and I joy, this moment, to think that even the
   wicked actions of ungodly men, though they are not deprived of their
   sinfulness, so as to make the men the less responsible, are,
   nevertheless, overruled by that great Lord of ours who works all things
   according to the counsel of His will! In the front I see Jesus leading
   the van of Providence. Behind He guards the rear. On the heights I see
   Jesus reigning King of Kings and Lord of Lords. In the deeps I mark the
   terror of His justice as He binds the dragon with His chain. Let the
   universal cry of "Hallelujah" rise unto the Son of God, world without
   end!

   Sit down and admire and adore His unlimited power--and then conclude by
   paying homage to that sovereignty of His which brooks no question, for
   the winds and waves did not only perform His will, but, as if they were
   waking into life and rising into intelligent knowledge of Him, they are
   said to obey Him--from which I gather that Christ is not only the
   forceful Master of unintelligent agencies, but that He is the Sovereign
   Master of things that can obey Him--and He will be obeyed. Ah, you may
   bite at Him and hiss at Him, but as the viper broke his teeth against
   the file, yet hurt it not, so shall the ungodly exercise all their
   craft and all their strength--and the result shall be shame and
   confusion of face to them.

   The kingdom of our Lord and Master is, by some, thought to be a long
   way off, and His cause is despaired of by faint-hearted men. But He
   that sits in the heavens laughs at the impatience of saints as well as
   at the impiety of sinners, for He knows that all is well! Out of
   seeming evil He produces good and from that good a better, still, and
   better still in infinite progression! All things move towards His
   eternal coronation! As once every atom of history converged to His
   Cross, so does it today project itself towards His crown--the Lord
   Jesus comes to His well-earned Throne as surely as He came to the
   shameful Cross! He comes and when He comes, it shall be as when He rose
   in the ship and rebuked the winds, and the men marveled--for all storms
   of raging passion, conflicting opinion and fierce warfare shall be
   hushed--and He shall be admired in His saints and glorified in all them
   that believe! Even unbelievers shall marvel at Him and say, "What
   manner of Person is this, that even earth and Hell obey Him and all
   things are subject to His sovereign power!"

   Happy are the eyes that shall see Him in that day with joy! Happy are
   the men who shall sit at the right hand of the Coming One! Oh, Beloved,
   your eyes and mine shall see it if we have first looked to the Redeemer
   upon the Cross and found salvation in Him! Courage, Brothers and
   Sisters, let the waves dash and the winds howl--the Lord of Hosts is
   with us--the God of Jacob is our refuge! All is safe because of His
   Presence and all shall end gloriously because of His manifestation! The
   Lord bless you, in tempest and in calm, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Law Written in the Heart

   (No. 1687)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 29, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE NEWINGTON.

   After those days, says the Lord, I will put My Law in their inward
   parts, and write it in their hearts."

   Jeremiah 31:33.

   LAST Lord's-Day morning [GOD'S NON-REMEMBRANCE OF SIN--NO. 1685] we
   spoke of the first great blessing of the Covenant of Grace, namely, the
   full forgiveness of sins. Then we dilated with delight upon that
   wonderful promise, "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no
   more," I hope our consciences were pacified and our hearts filled with
   wonder as we thought of God's casting behind His back all the sins of
   His people, so that we could sing with David, "Bless the Lord, O my
   soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, O
   my soul, and forget not all His benefits: who forgives all your
   iniquities."

   This great blessing of pardoned sin is always connected with the
   renewal of the heart. It is not given because of the change of heart,
   but it is always given with the change of heart. If God takes away the
   guilt of sin, He is sure, at the same time, to remove the power of sin.
   If He puts away our offenses against His Law, He also makes us desire,
   in the future, to obey the Law of God. In our text we observe the
   excellence and dignity of the Law of God. The Gospel has not come into
   the world to set aside the Law. Salvation by Grace does not erase a
   single precept of the Law, nor lower the standard of justice in the
   smallest degree--on the contrary, as Paul says--we do not make void the
   Law through faith, but we establish the Law.

   The Law is never honored by fallen man till he comes from under its
   condemning rule, walks by faith and lives under the Covenant of Grace.
   When we were under the Covenant of Works, we dishonored the Law, but
   now we venerate it as a perfect display of moral rectitude. Our Lord
   Jesus has shown to an assembled universe that the Law is not to be
   trifled with and that every transgression and disobedience must receive
   a just recompense of reward, since the sin which He bore on our account
   brought upon Him, as our innocent Substitute, the doom of suffering and
   death. Our Lord Jesus has testified, by His death, that even if sin is
   pardoned, yet it is not put away without an expiatory Sacrifice. The
   death of Christ rendered more honor to the Law than all the obedience
   of all who were ever under it could have rendered! And it was a more
   forcible vindication of eternal justice than if all the redeemed had
   been cast into Hell.

   When the Holy One smites His own Son, His wrath against sin is evident
   to all. But this is not enough. The Law is, in the Gospel, not only
   vindicated by the Sacrifice of Christ, but it is honored by the work of
   the Spirit of God upon the hearts of men. Whereas under the Old
   Covenant, the commands of the Law excited our evil natures to
   rebellion--under the Covenant of Grace we consent unto the Law, that it
   is good, and our prayer is, "Teach me to do Your will, O Lord." What
   the Law could not do because of the weakness of the flesh, the Gospel
   has done through the Spirit of God! Thus the Law is held in honor among
   Believers and though they are no more under it as a Covenant of Works,
   they are, in a measure, conformed to it as they see it in the life of
   Christ Jesus, and they delight in it after the inward man.

   Things required by the Law are bestowed by the Gospel. God demands
   obedience under the Law--God works obedience under the Gospel. Holiness
   is asked of us by the Law--holiness is worked in us by the Gospel so
   that the difference between the economics of Law and Gospel is not to
   be found in any diminution of the demands of the Law, but in the actual
   giving unto the redeemed that which the Law exacted of them--and in the
   working in them that which the Law required. Notice, beloved Friends,
   that under the Old Covenant, the Law of God was given in a most
   awe-inspiring manner and yet it did not secure loyal obedience. God
   came to Sinai and the mountain was altogether on a smoke because the
   Lord descended upon it in fire--and the smoke ascended as the smoke of
   a furnace--the whole mountain quaked greatly!

   So terrible was the sight of God manifesting Himself on Sinai that even
   Moses said, "I exceedingly fear and quake." Out of the thick darkness
   which covered the sublime summit, there came forth the sound of a
   trumpet, waxing exceed-

   ingly loud and long, and a Voice proclaimed, one by one, the 10 great
   statutes and ordinances of the moral Law. I think I see the people at a
   distance, with bounds set about the mountain, crouching with abject
   fear and, at last, entreating that these words might not be spoken to
   them any more! So terrible was the sound of Jehovah's voice, even when
   He was not declaring vengeance, but simply expounding righteousness,
   that the people could not endure it any longer--and yet no permanent
   impression was left upon their minds--no obedience was shown in their
   lives!

   Men may be cowed by power, but they can only be converted by love. The
   sword of justice has less power over human hearts than the scepter of
   mercy. Further to preserve that Law, God Himself inscribed it upon two
   tables of stone and He gave these tablets into the hands of Moses. What
   a treasure! Surely no particles of matter had ever been so honored as
   these slabs which had been touched by the finger of God and bore on
   them the legible impression of His mind! But these Laws on stone were
   not kept--neither the stones nor the Laws were reverenced. Moses had
   not long gone up into the mountain before the once awe-struck people
   were bowing before the golden calf, forgetful of Sinai and its solemn
   Voice--and making for themselves the likeness of an ox that eats
   grass--and bowing before it as the symbol of the Godhead!

   When Moses came down from the hill with those priceless tablets in His
   hands, He saw the people wholly given up to base idolatry and, in his
   indignation, he dashed the tablets to the ground and broke them in
   pieces, as well he might when he saw how the people had spiritually
   broken them and violated every Word of the Most High! From all this I
   gather that the Law is never really obeyed as the result of servile
   fear. You may preach up the anger of God and the terrors of the world
   to come, but these do not melt the heart to loyal obedience. It is
   necessary, for other ends, that man should know of God's resolve to
   punish sin, but the heart is not, by that fact, won to virtue. Man
   revolts yet more and more--so stubborn is he that the more he is
   commanded, the more he rebels!

   The Decalogue upon your Church walls and in your daily service has its
   ends, but it can never be operative upon men's lives until it is also
   written on their hearts. Tables of stone are hard and men count
   obedience to God's Law to be a hard thing--the Commands are judged to
   be stony while the heart is stony--and men harden themselves because
   the way of the precept is hard to their cold minds. Stones are
   proverbially cold and the Law seems a cold, chill thing, for which we
   have no love as long as the appeal is to our fears. Tablets of stone,
   though apparently durable, can readily enough be broken and so can
   God's Commandments--and so they are, indeed, broken every day by us.
   Those who have the clearest knowledge of the will of God, nevertheless
   offend against Him. As long as they have nothing to keep them in check
   but a servile dread of punishment, or a selfish hope of reward, they
   yield no loyal homage to the statutes of the Lord!

   At this time I have to show you the way in which God secures to Himself
   obedience to His Law in quite another fashion--not by thundering it out
   from Sinai, nor by engraving it upon tablets of stone--but by coming in
   gentleness and infinite compassion into the hearts of men and there,
   upon fleshy tables, inscribing the Commands of His Law in such a manner
   that they are joyfully obeyed and men become the willing servants of
   God! This is the second great privilege of the Covenant--not second in
   value, but in order--"who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all
   your diseases." It is thus described by Ezekiel--"And I will put My
   Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall
   keep My judgments, and do them."

   In the Epistle to the Hebrews we have it in another form and we read it
   thus--"Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new
   Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: not
   according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
   when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
   because they continued not in My Covenant, and I regarded them not,
   says the Lord. For this is the Covenant that I will make with the house
   of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put My Laws into
   their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a
   God, and they shall be to Me a people."

   This is so inestimably precious that you who know the Lord are longing
   for it and it is your great delight that it is to be worked in you by
   the Sovereign Grace of God! We shall, first of all, look at the
   tablets-- "I will put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in
   their hearts." Secondly, at the writing. Thirdly, at the Writer and,
   fourthly, at the results which come of this wondrous writing. O that
   the Spirit who has promised to lead us into all the Truths of God may
   now illuminate us!

   I. First, I invite your attention to THE TABLETS upon which God writes
   His Law-- "I will put My Law in their inward parts." Just as once He
   put the two tables into the ark of gopher wood, so He will put His holy
   Law into our in-

   ward nature and enclose it in our thoughts and minds and memories and
   affections, as a jewel in a case. Then He adds, "And I will write it in
   their hearts." Just as the Holy Words were engraved upon stone, so
   shall they now be written in the heart, in the handwriting of the Lord,
   Himself. Mark that the Law is written not on the heart, but in the
   heart, in the very texture and constitution of it, so that into the
   center and core of the soul, obedience shall be infused as a vital
   principle!

   Thus, you see, the Lord has selected for His tablets that which is the
   seat of life. It is in the heart that life is to be found, a wound,
   there, is fatal. Where the seat of life is, there the seat of obedience
   shall be. In the heart, life has its permanent palace and perpetual
   abode--and God says that, instead of writing His Holy Law on stones
   which may be left at a distance--He will write it on the heart, which
   must always be within us. Instead of placing the Law upon phylacteries
   which can be bound between the eyes but may easily be taken off, He
   will write it in the heart, where it must always remain. He has bid His
   people write His Laws upon the posts of their doors and upon their
   gates, but in those conspicuous places they might become so familiar as
   to be unnoticed. The Lord, Himself, now writes them where they must
   always be noted and always produce effect.

   If men have the precepts written in the abode of their life, they live
   with the Law and cannot live without it. It is a wonderful thing that
   God should do this. It displays infinitely greater wisdom than if the
   Law had been inscribed on slabs of granite or engraved on plates of
   gold. What wisdom is this, which operates upon the original spring of
   life, so that all that flows forth from man shall come from a
   sanctified fountainhead! Observe next, that not only is the heart the
   seat of life, but it is the governing power. It is from the heart, as
   from a royal metropolis, that the imperial commands of the man are
   issued by which hand and foot, eye and tongue and all the members are
   ordered. If the heart is right, then the other powers must yield
   submission to its sway and become right, too.

   If God writes His Law upon the heart, then the eyes will purify their
   glances, the tongue will speak according to rule, the hands will move
   and the feet will travel as God ordains. When the heart is fully
   influenced by God's Spirit, then the will and the intellect, the memory
   and the imagination and everything else which makes up the inward man,
   comes under cheerful allegiance to the King of Kings! God Himself says,
   "Give me your heart," for the heart is the key of the entire position.
   Hence the supreme wisdom of the Lord in setting up His Law where it
   becomes operative upon the entire man. But before God can write upon a
   man's heart, it must be prepared. It is most unfit to be a writing
   tablet for the Lord until it is renewed. The heart must, first of all,
   undergo erasures.

   What is written on the heart, already, some of us know to our deep
   regret. Original sin has cut deep lines, Satan has scored his horrible
   handwriting in black letters and our evil habits have left their
   impressions. How can the Lord write there? No one would expect the Holy
   God to inscribe His Holy Law upon an unholy mind! The former things
   must be taken away, that there may be clear space upon which new and
   better things may be engraved. But who can erase these lines? "Can the
   Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you,
   also, do good, that are accustomed to do evil." The God who can take
   away the spots from the leopard and the blackness from the Ethiopian,
   can also remove the evil lines which now deface the heart!

   As the heart must undergo erasure, it must also experience a thorough
   cleansing, not of the surface only, but of its entire fabric. Truly,
   Brothers and Sisters, it was far easier for Hercules to purge the
   Augean stables than for our hearts to be purged, for the sin that lies
   within us is not an accumulation of external defilement, but an inward,
   all-pervading corruption! The taint of secret and spiritual evil is in
   man's natural life. Every pulse of his soul is disordered by it. The
   eggs of all crimes are within our being--the accursed virus, from whose
   deadly venom every foul design will come--is present in the soul. Not
   only tendency to sin, but sin, itself, has taken possession of the soul
   and blackened and polluted it through and through till there is not a
   fiber of the heart unstained with iniquity! God cannot write His Law in
   our inward parts till, with water and with blood, He has purged us.

   Tablets on which the Lord shall write must be clean, therefore the
   heart on which God is to engrave His Law must be a cleansed heart. It
   is a great joy to perceive that from the Person of our Lord,
   heart-cleansing blood and water flowed so that the provision is equal
   to the necessity! Blessed be the name of our gracious God! He knows how
   to erase the evil and to cleanse the soul through His Holy Spirit's
   applying the work of Jesus to us! In addition to this, the heart needs
   to be softened, for the heart is naturally hard and, in some men, it
   has become harder than an adamant stone! They have re-

   sisted God's love till they are impervious to it--they have stood out
   obstinately against God's will till they have become desperately set on
   mischief and nothing can affect them.

   God must melt the heart, must transform it from granite into flesh--and
   He has the power to do it! Blessed be His name, according to the
   Covenant of Grace, He has promised to work this wonder and He will! Nor
   would the softening be enough, for there are some who have a tenderness
   of the most deceiving kind. They receive the Word of God with joy. They
   feel every expression of it, but they speedily go their way and forget
   what manner of men they are. They are as impressible as the water, but
   the impression is as soon removed, so that another change is needed,
   namely, to make them retentive of that which is good--otherwise you
   might engrave and re-engrave--but, like an inscription upon wax, it
   would be gone in a moment if exposed to heat.

   The devil, the world and the temptations of life would soon erase out
   of the heart all that God had written there if He did not create it
   anew with the faculty of holding fast that which is good. In a word,
   the heart of man needs to be totally changed, even as Jesus said to
   Nicodemus, "You must be born again." Dear Hearers, we preach to you
   that whoever believes in Christ has everlasting life and we speak
   neither more, nor less, than the Truth of God when we say so! But yet,
   believe us, there must be as great a change in the heart as if a man
   were slain and made alive again! There must be a new creation, a
   resurrection from the dead--old things must pass away--and all things
   must become new. God's Law can never be written upon the old natural
   heart--there must be a new and spiritual nature given--and then, upon
   the center of that new life, upon the throne of that new power within
   our life, God will set up the proclamation of His blessed will and what
   He commands shall be done.

   So, then, you see these tablets are not so easily written upon, as
   perhaps we first thought. If God is to write the Law upon the heart,
   the heart must be prepared, and in order to being prepared, it must be
   entirely renewed by a miracle of mercy, such as can only be worked by
   that Omnipotent hand which made both Heaven and earth.

   II. Secondly, let us pass on to notice THE WRITING. "I will put My Law
   in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." What is this
   writing? First, the matter of it is the Law of God. God writes upon the
   hearts of His people that which is already revealed. He inscribes there
   nothing novel and unrevealed, but His own will which He has already
   given us in the Book of the Law. He writes upon the heart, by gracious
   operation, that which He has already written in the Bible by gracious
   Revelation. He writes not philosophy, nor imagination, nor superstition
   nor fanaticism, nor idle fancies. If any man says to me, "God has
   written such-and-such a thing on my heart," I reply, " Show it to me in
   the Bible," for if it is not according to the other Scriptures, it is
   not a Scripture of God!

   A fancy as to a man's being a Prophet, or a prince, or an angel may be
   on a man's heart, but God did not write it there, for His own
   declaration is, "I will write My Law in their hearts," and He speaks
   not of anything beyond. The nonsense of modern pretenders to prophecy
   is no writing of God--it would be a dishonor to a sane man to ascribe
   it to Him! How can it be of the Lord? He here promises to write His own
   Law on the heart, but nothing else. Be content to have the Law written
   on your soul and wander not into vain imaginings lest you receive a
   strong delusion to believe a lie. Observe, however, that God says He
   will write His whole Law on the heart--this is included in the words,
   "My Law."

   God's work is complete in all its parts and beautifully harmonious. He
   will not write one command and leave out the rest as so many do in
   their reforms. They become indignant in their virtue against a
   particular sin, but they riot in other evils. Drunkenness is to them
   the most damnable of all transgressions, but covetousness and
   uncleanness they wink at! They denounce theft and yet defraud! They cry
   out against pride and yet indulge envy! Thus they are partial and do
   the work of the Lord deceitfully. It must not be so! God does not set
   before us a partial holiness, but the whole moral Law! "I will write My
   Law in their hearts." Human reforms are generally lopsided, but the
   Lord's work of Grace is balanced and proportionate. The Lord writes the
   perfect Law in the hearts of men because He intends to produce perfect
   men.

   Mark, again, that on the heart there is written not the Law toned down
   and altered, but, "My Law"--that very same Law which was, at first,
   written on the heart of unfallen man. Paul says of natural men, that
   "they show the work of the Law written in their hearts." There is
   enough of the Light of God left on the conscience to condemn men for
   most of their iniquities. The original record of the Law upon man's
   heart at his creation has been injured and almost obliterated by man's
   fall and his subsequent transgressions, but the Lord, in renewing the
   heart, makes the writing fresh and vivid, even the writing of the first
   principles of righteousness and truth.

   But to come a little closer to the matter--what does the Scripture mean
   by writing the Law of God in the heart? The writing, itself, includes a
   great many things. A man who has the Law of God written in his heart,
   first of all, knows it. He is instructed in the ordinances and statutes
   of the Lord. He is an illuminated person and no longer one of those who
   knows not the Law and is cursed. God's Spirit has taught him what is
   right and what is wrong. He knows this by heart and, therefore, can no
   longer put darkness for light, and light for darkness. This Law, next,
   abides upon his memory. When he had it only upon a tablet, he must
   necessarily go into his house to look at it, but now he carries it
   about with him in his heart, and knows, at once, what will be right and
   what will be wrong. God has given him a touchstone by which he tries
   things.

   He finds that "all is not gold that glitters," and all is not holy
   which pretends to that character. He separates the precious from the
   vile and does this habitually, for his knowledge of God's Law and his
   memory of it are attended by a discernment of spirit which God has
   worked in him, so that he quickly discerns what is according to the
   mind of God and what is not. Now this is a great point, for some things
   are commonly done by men which they will even defend and say that there
   is no wrong in them. But, according to the Divine rule, they are
   utterly unjust. God's people judge these things and take no pleasure in
   them. A sacred instinct warns the Believer of the approach of sin. Long
   before public sentiment has proclaimed a hue and cry against
   questionable practices, the Christian man, even if deluded, for a
   while, by current custom, yet feels a trembling and an uneasiness. Even
   if he consents outwardly--being overborne by general opinion--a
   something within protests and leads him to consider whether the matter
   can be defended. As soon as he detects the evil, he shrinks from it. It
   is a grand thing to possess a universal detector, so that, go where you
   may, you are not dependent upon the judgment of others and, therefore,
   are not deceived as multitudes are. This, however, is only a part of
   the matter, and a very small part comparatively.

   The Law is written on a man's heart, further than this, when he
   consents unto the Law that it is good. It is when his conscience, being
   restored, cries, "Yes, that is so, and ought to be so! That command by
   which God has forbidden a certain course is a proper and prudent
   command--it ought to be enjoined." It is a hopeful sign when a man no
   longer wishes that the Divine commands were other than they are, but
   confirms them by the verdict of his judgment. Are there not men who in
   their anger wish that killing were not murder? Are there not others who
   do not steal, but yet wish they might take their neighbors' goods? Are
   there not many who wish that fornication and adultery were not vices?
   This proves that their hearts are depraved!

   But it is not so with the regenerate, they would not have the Law
   altered for any reason! Their vote is with the Law. They regard it as
   the guardian of society, the basis on which the peace of the universe
   can, alone, be built, for only by righteousness can any order of things
   be established. If we could possess the wisdom of God, we would make
   just that Law which God has made, for the Law is holy, just, good and
   promotes man's highest advantage! It is a great thing when a man gets
   as far as that. But, furthermore, there is worked in the heart, by God,
   a love to the Law as well as a consent to it--such a love that the man
   thanks God that He has given him such a fair and lovely representation
   of what perfect holiness should be--that He has given such measuring
   lines by which he knows how a house is to be built in which God can
   dwell. Thus thanking the Lord, his prayer, desire, longing, hungering
   and thirsting are after righteousness, that he may, in all things, be
   according to the mind of God.

   It is a glorious thing when the heart delights itself in the Law of the
   Lord and finds, therein, its solace and pleasure. The Law is fully
   written on the heart when a man takes pleasure in holiness and feels a
   deep pain whenever sin approaches him. Oh, my dear Friend, the Lord has
   done great things for you when every evil thing is obnoxious to you!
   Even though you fall into sin through the infirmity of your flesh, yet
   if it causes you intense agony and sorrow, it is because God has
   written His Law in your heart! Even though you cannot be as holy as you
   want to be, yet if the ways of holiness are your pleasure--if they are
   the very element in which you live as much as the fish lives in the
   sea--then you are the subject of a very wonderful change of heart!

   It is not so much what you do, as what you delight to do, which becomes
   the clearest test of your character. Many strictly religious people who
   go to and fro to Church and Chapel would be uncommonly glad if they did
   not feel bound to do so. Is not their public worship a dead formality?
   A great many people have family prayers and private prayers who wish
   they could be rid of the nuisance. Is there any religion in bodily
   exercises which are burdensome to the heart? Nothing is acceptable to
   God until it is acceptable to yourself--God will not receive your
   sacrifice unless you offer it will-

   ingly! How contrary this is to the notion of many, for they say, "You
   see I deny myself by going so many times to a place of worship and by
   private prayer, therefore I must be truly religious." The very reverse
   is far nearer the truth! When it becomes a misery to serve God, then,
   indeed, the heart is far away from spiritual health, for when the heart
   is renewed, it delights to worship and serve the Lord!

   Instead of saying, "I would omit prayer if I could," the regenerate
   mind cries, "I wish I could be always praying." Instead of saying, "I
   would keep away from the assembly of God's people if I could," the
   newborn nature wishes, like David, to dwell in the House of the Lord
   forever! This is a great evidence of the writing of the Law upon the
   heart, when holiness becomes a pleasure and sin becomes a sorrow. When
   this is done, what great things God has done for us! The main point of
   the whole, is this, that whereas our nature was once contrary to the
   Law of God so that whatever God forbade we at once desired, and
   whatever God commanded we, therefore, began to dislike, the Holy Spirit
   comes and changes our nature and makes it congruous to the Law--so
   that, now, whatever God forbids we forbid and whatever God commands,
   our will commands!

   How much better to have the Law written upon the heart than upon
   tablets of stone! If anybody should enquire how the Lord keeps the
   writing upon the heart, legible, I should like to spend a minute or two
   in showing the process. How the Holy Spirit first writes the Law on the
   heart, I cannot tell. The outward means are the preaching of the Word
   and the reading of it. But how the Holy Spirit directly operates on the
   soul, we do not know--it is one of the great mysteries of Grace. This
   much we know within ourselves, that whereas we were blind, now we see
   and, whereas we abhorred the Law of God, we now feel an intense delight
   in it! We also know that the Holy Spirit worked this change, but how He
   did it remains unknown. That part of His holy office which we can
   discern is done according to the usual laws of mental operation. He
   enlightens by knowledge, convinces by argument, leads by persuasion,
   strengthens by instruction and so forth.

   So far, also, we know that one way by which the Law is kept written
   upon a Christian's heart is this--a sense of God's Presence. The
   Believer feels that he could not sin with God looking on. It would need
   a brazen face for a man to play the traitor in the presence of a
   king--such things are done "under the rose," as men word it--but not
   before the monarch's face! So the Christian feels that he dwells in
   God's sight and this forbids him to disobey. The eye of the Heavenly
   Father is the best monitor of the child of God. Next, the Christian has
   a lively sense within him of the degradation which sin once brought
   upon him. If there is one thing I never can forget, personally, it is
   the horror of my heart while I was yet under sin. God revealed my state
   to me. Ah, Friends, the old proverb that a burnt child dreads the fire
   has an intensity of truth about it in the case of one who has ever been
   burnt by sin so as to be driven to despair by it! He hates it with a
   perfect hatred and, by that means, God writes the Law upon his heart.

   But a sense of love is a yet more powerful factor. Let a man know that
   God loves him, let him feel sure that God always did love him from
   before the foundations of the world, and he must try to please God. Let
   him be assured that the Father loved him so much as to give His
   only-begotten Son to die that he might live through Him and he must
   love God and hate evil. A sense of pardon, of adoption and of God's
   sweet favor, both in Providence and in Grace must sanctify a man. He
   cannot willfully offend against such love! On the contrary, he feels
   himself bound to obey God in return for such unsearchable Grace and
   thus, by a sense of love, does God write His Law upon the hearts of His
   people!

   Another very powerful pen with which the Lord writes is to be found in
   the sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ. When we see Jesus spit upon,
   scourged and crucified, we feel that we must hate sin with all the
   intensity of our nature. Can you count the purple drops of His
   redeeming blood and then go back to live in the iniquity which cost the
   Lord so dear? Impossible! The death of Christ writes the Law of God
   very deeply upon the central heart of man. The Cross is the crucifier
   of sin. Besides that, God actually establishes His holy Law in the
   throne of the heart by giving us a new and heavenly life. There is,
   within a Christian, an immortal principle which cannot sin because it
   is born of God and cannot die! It is the living and incorruptible Seed
   which lives and abides forever! In regeneration there is imparted to us
   a something altogether foreign to our corrupt nature--a Divine
   principle is dropped into the soul which can neither be corrupted nor
   made to die--and by this means the Law is written on the heart. I do
   not pretend to explain the process of regeneration, but for certain, it
   involves a Divine life implanted by the Holy Spirit.

   Once more, the Holy Spirit, Himself, dwells in Believers. I pray you,
   never forget this marvelous doctrine, that as truly as ever God dwelt
   in human flesh in the Person of the God-Man Mediator, so truly does the
   Holy Spirit dwell in the

   bodies of all redeemed men and women who have been born again! And by
   the force of that indwelling, He keeps the mind forever permeated with
   holiness, forever subservient to the will of the Most High!

   III. Now we turn, for just a minute, to think of THE WRITER. Who is it
   that writes the Law in the heart? It is God, Himself! "I will do it,"
   He says. Note, first, that He has a right to write His Law in the
   heart. He made the heart--it is His tablet--let Him write there
   whatever He wills. As clay in the hands of the potter, so are we in His
   hands. Note, next, that He, alone, can write the Law in the heart. It
   will never be written there by any other hand. The Law of God is not to
   be written in the heart by human power. Alas, how often have I
   expounded the Law of God and the Gospel of God, but I have got no
   further than the ears--only the living God can write in the living
   heart! This is noble work, angels, themselves, cannot attain to it!
   "This is the finger of God."

   As God, alone, can write there, and must write there, so He, alone,
   shall have the Glory of that writing when once it is perfected. When
   God writes, He writes perfectly. You and I make blots and errors--there
   needs to be a list of itemized errors at the end of every human piece
   of writing! But when God writes, blots or mistakes are out of the
   question! No holiness can excel the holiness produced by the Holy
   Spirit when His inward work is fully completed! Moreover, He writes
   indelibly. I defy the devil to get a single letter of the Law of God
   out of a man's heart when God has written it there! When the Holy
   Spirit has come with all the power of His Divinity and rested on our
   nature--and stamped into it the life of holiness--then the devil may
   come with his black wings and all his unhallowed craftiness, but he can
   never erase the eternal lines!

   We bear in our hearts the marks of the Lord God Eternal and we shall
   bear them eternally! Written rocks bear their inscriptions long, but
   written hearts bear them forever and ever! Does not the Lord say, "I
   will put My fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from Me"?
   Blessed be God for those immortal principles which forbid the child of
   God to sin!

   IV. I wish to finish by noticing THE RESULTS of the Law being thus
   written in the heart. I hope while I have been preaching about it, many
   of you have been saying, "I hope that the Law will be written in my
   heart." Remember that this is a gift and privilege of the Covenant of
   Grace and not a work of man. Dear Friends, if any of you have said, "I
   do not find anything good in me, therefore I cannot come to Christ,"
   you talk foolishly! The absence of good is the reason why you should
   come to Christ to have your needs supplied. "Oh, but if I could write
   God's Law in my heart I would come to Christ." Would you? What would
   you need Christ for? But if the Law is not written on your heart, then
   come to Jesus to have it so written!

   The New Covenant says, "I will put My Law in their inward parts and
   will write My Law in their hearts." Come, then, to have the Law thus
   inscribed within! Come just as you are, before a single line has been
   inscribed. The Lord Jesus loves to prepare His own tablets and write
   every letter of His own Epistles--come to Him just as you are, that He
   may do all things for you! What are the results of the Law being
   written in the hearts of men? Frequently the first result is great
   sorrow. If I have God's Law written in my heart, then I say to myself,
   "Ah me, that I should have lived a lawbreaker so long! This blessed
   Law, this lovely Law, why I have not even thought of it, or if I have
   thought of it, it has provoked me to disobedience! Sin revived and I
   died when the Commandment came." We wring our hands and cry, "How could
   we be so wicked as to break so just a Law? How could we be so willful
   as to go against our own interests? Knew we not that a breach of the
   Commandment is an injury to ourselves?" Thus we are in bitterness as
   one that is in bitterness for the death of his first-born. I do not
   believe God has ever written His Law on your hearts if you have not
   mourned over sin. One of the earliest signs of Grace is a dew upon the
   eyes because of sin.

   The next effect of it is there comes upon the man a strong and stern
   resolve that he will not break that Law again, but will keep it with
   all his might. He cries out with David, "I have sworn and I will
   perform it, that I will keep Your righteous judgments." His whole heart
   says, when reading the precepts of the Lord--"Yes, that is what I ought
   to be, that is what I wish to be and that is what I will be, according
   to the will of God." That strong resolve soon leads to a fierce
   conflict, for another law lifts up its head, a law in our members--and
   that other law cries, "Not so quick, there! Your new Law which has come
   into your soul to rule you shall not be obeyed! I will be master!"

   He who is born within us to be our king finds the old Herod ready to
   slay the young child. The lust of the eyes and the lust of the
   flesh--the pride of life--each one of these swears warfare against the
   new Monarch and the fresh power that is come into the heart. Some of
   you know what this struggle means. It is a very hard fight, with some,
   to keep from

   actual sin. Have you not, when troubled with a quick temper, had to put
   your hand to your mouth to stop yourself from saying what you used to
   say, but what you never wish to say again? Have you not often gone
   upstairs to get alone, feeling that you would soon slip if the Lord did
   not hold you up? How wise to get alone with God and cry to Him for
   help! How prudent to watch day and night against evil!

   Certain braggers talk about having got beyond all that. I should be
   glad to think that there are such Brethren--but I should need to keep
   them in a glass case to show them round, or in an iron safe where
   thieves could not get at them! I conceive it to be a snare of the devil
   to imagine that you are beyond the need of daily watchfulness! For my
   own part, I have not passed beyond conflict and struggle. I bear
   testimony that the battle grows more stern every day! Those of God's
   people with whom I associate, I still find fighting and wrestling.
   Sometimes I know the devil does not roar, but I am more afraid of him
   when he is quiet than when he rages. Of the two, I would sooner he
   would roar, for a roaring devil is better than a sleeping devil.
   Whenever he gives way, he only gives an inch to take a mile--and
   whenever you begin to say to yourself, "My corruptions are all dead. I
   now have no tendencies to sin," you are in awful peril!

   Poor Soul, you do not know what you are talking about! God send you to
   school and give you a little of His Light and you will sing another
   tune, I am sure, before long! These are the incidental results--when
   the Lord writes the Law in the heart, strifes and struggles are common
   within the man--for holiness strives for the mastery. But does not
   something better than this come of the Divine heart-writing? Oh, yes!
   There comes actual obedience. The man not only consents to the Law,
   that it is good, but he obeys it! And if there is anything which Christ
   commands, no matter what it is, the man seeks to do it--not only wishes
   to do it, but actually does it! And if there is anything that is wrong,
   he not only wishes to abstain from it, but he does abstain from it. God
   helping him, he becomes upright, righteous, sober, godly, loving and
   Christ-like--for this it is which the Spirit of God works in him! He
   would be perfect were it not for the old lusts of the flesh which
   linger, even in the hearts of the regenerate.

   Now the Believer feels intense pleasure in everything that is good. If
   there is anything right and true in the world, he is on the side of it.
   If there are defeats to the Truth of God, he is defeated. But if the
   Truth of God marches on, conquering and to conquer, he conquers and
   takes and divides the spoil with joy! Now he is on God's side; now he
   is on Christ's side; now he is on truth's side; now he is on holiness'
   side and a man cannot be that without being a happy man! With all his
   struggles, all his weeping and all his confessions, he is a happy man
   because he is on the happy side. God is with him and he, by God's
   Grace, is with God--and so he must be blessed!

   As this proceeds, the man becomes more and more prepared to dwell in
   Heaven. He is changed into God's image from Glory to Glory even as by
   the Spirit of the Lord. Our fitness for Heaven is not a thing that will
   be clapped upon us in the last few minutes of our life, just as we are
   going to die, but the children of God have a meetness for Heaven as
   soon as ever they are saved--and that meetness grows and increases till
   they are ripe and then, like ripe fruit, they drop from the tree and
   find themselves in the bosom of their Father God! God will never keep a
   soul out of Heaven half a minute after it is fully prepared to go there
   and so, when God has fitted us to be partakers of the inheritance of
   the saints in His Light, we shall enter at once into the joy of our
   Lord.

   My Brothers and Sisters, I feel I have talked feebly about one of the
   most blessed subjects that ever occupied the thoughts of man--how God's
   Law shall be kept, how it shall be honored, how holiness shall come
   into the world--and we shall no longer be rebellious. Herein let us
   trust in our Lord Jesus, who is to us the Surety of that Covenant of
   which this is one great promise--"I will put My Law in their inward
   parts, and in their hearts will I write it." God do so to us, for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

   (No. 1688)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, AUGUST 27, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel." Colossians 1:23.

   I THINK this morning we showed pretty plainly that many a soul has a
   great struggle to attain to the hope of the Gospel. [See "Despair
   Denounced and Grace Glorified," No. 1676.] Not without hand-to-hand
   fighting do many hearts lay hold on Christ and eternal life. Conscience
   often sets up a chevaux de frise around the hill of Calvary and thus
   cuts off the convicted sinner from approaching his Savior. Doubts and
   fears, the Black Watch of evil, drive back the coming ones and worry
   those who would gladly hide in the Rock of Ages. Satan summons all his
   hosts to push men back from the Cross that they may not come to Christ
   and live.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, the battle does not end when, by a desperate
   rush, a man has come to Christ. In many it assumes a new form--the
   enemy now attempts to drag the trembler from his refuge and eject him
   from his stronghold! It is difficult to get at the hope of the Gospel,
   but quite as difficult to keep it so as not to be moved away from it.
   If Satan spends great power in keeping us from the hope, he uses equal
   force in endeavoring to drag us away from it--and equal cunning in
   endeavoring to allure us from it. Hence the Apostle tells us not to be
   moved away from the hope of the Gospel. The exhortation is necessary in
   presence of an imminent danger. Do not think that in the moment when
   you believe in Christ the conflict is over, or you will be bitterly
   disappointed! It is then that the battle renews itself and every inch
   of the road swarms with enemies.

   Between here and Heaven you will always have to fight, more or less,
   and frequently the severest struggle will be at a time when you are
   least prepared for it. There may be smooth passages in your career and
   you may, for a while, be like your Savior in the wilderness, of whom it
   is said, "Then the devil departed from Him, and angels came and
   ministered unto Him." But you may not, therefore, cry, "My mountain
   stands firm, I shall never be moved," for fair weather may not outlast
   a single day! Do not grow secure, or carnally presumptuous. There is
   but a short space between one battle and another in this world. It is a
   series of skirmishes even when it does not assume the form of a pitched
   battle. He that would win Heaven must fight for it! He that would take
   the new Jerusalem must scale it and if he has the wits to take Jacob's
   ladder and set it against the wall and climb up that way, he will win
   the City. "The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take
   it by force."

   At this time our subject is not the winning, but the wearing--not the
   taking but the holding of the fort. "Be not moved away," you that have
   come to it. "Be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel."

   I. First, BE NOT MOVED AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT OF THAT HOPE so as to give
   up any part of the hope which is revealed to you by the Gospel. What is
   your hope? First, it is the hope of full salvation--the hope that,
   inasmuch as you have believed in Jesus Christ, you are free from all
   condemnation at the present moment and shall be free from all
   condemnation in the future as to all your sins. And that, in addition
   to this, He that takes away the condemnation of sin will also destroy
   the power of it over you. You have this hope--that being made to love
   righteousness you shall be enabled to walk in obedience and "to perfect
   holiness in the fear of the Lord."

   Your hope is that one day you shall be presented holy, without blame
   and unreprovable in the sight of the great Father. You shall, one day,
   be presented "without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing," cleansed
   from all guilt and cleansed from all tendency to sin and to
   corruption--and made like unto the perfect creature of God when first
   it comes from His hands. Oh, this is a blessed hope! "He that has this
   hope in him purifies himself even as Christ is pure." We hope that we
   shall be like unto Christ, Himself, and that the Glory of His holiness
   shall be our glory--and we shall see His face and His name shall be on
   our foreheads--and we shall be without fault before the Throne of God.
   Now, never give that up!

   Never allow a particle of it to be diminished. God means all that He
   has said, and more, rather than less. Let no man debase the currency of
   Heaven or clip the coin of the realm of the Great King.

   The first part of it--hold to it, that the Lord Jesus Christ has
   cleansed you from all the guilt and penalty of sin, so that not a speck
   remains to accuse or condemn you. Hold to it, moreover, that if He has
   once washed you, you shall not need to wash, again, in that fountain
   filled with blood, for, "He that is washed needs not except to wash his
   feet." And that washing shall be given to him by the condescending
   hands of Christ. The water shall be a second cure of that which the
   blood has already cleansed and removed. The blood-washing has removed
   all guilt and prevented all possibility that sin shall have dominion
   over you. Complete forgiveness and full justification are proofs that
   through your Lord's endurance of the death penalty, you are no more
   under the Law, but under Grace.

   My soul rejoices, tonight, in perfect pardon! I will not take off a
   corner of it so as to allow that the smallest charge can lie against
   us! We are complete in Christ! He that believes in Him is justified
   from all things--

   "Here's pardon for transgressions past, It matters not how black their
   cast! And, oh, my Soul, with wonder view-- For sins to come, here's
   pardon too!" All pardon is provided in the one great Sacrifice offered
   by our bleeding Lord who has now gone into the heavens to plead the
   merit of His blood. Never take off a fraction from that other part of
   full salvation, namely, the possibility and the absolute certainty that
   every sinful tendency now in your nature shall be utterly destroyed.
   There shall remain in you no root of bitterness, no scar of evil, no
   footprint of iniquity! There shall be no tinder in your soul upon which
   the sparks of temptation can fall so as to live and make a flame! And
   when the Prince of this world comes he shall find nothing in you. Then
   you shall enter into your eternal rest, for God keeps not His ripe
   wheat in the field, but takes it Home when it is once fit to be
   gathered into the garner. This is your hope through the Gospel--be not
   moved away from it.

   In connection with this, there is the hope of final perseverance. I
   confess that to me it is one of the most attractive doctrines of God's
   Word, that, "the righteous shall hold on his way, and he that has clean
   hands shall be stronger and stronger." For I am "confident of this very
   thing, that He which has begun a good work in you will perform it until
   the day of Jesus Christ." "I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they
   shall never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of My hands." "He
   that believes in Him is not condemned." "He that lives and believes in
   Me shall never die." There are many assurances to this effect and if
   anything definite is taught in Scripture, I am confident that this is
   among the plainest of such teachings!

   I beseech you, do not shun this doctrine as though it would lead you
   into the least presumption. If properly understood, its legitimate
   effect is the very reverse of carelessness! If it is true that once
   enlisted in this army of the Lord, you must and shall fight until you
   are a conqueror, then there is no temptation to lay down the sword, for
   a while, in the hope of taking it up, again, at a more convenient
   season. If, as some say, you may be Christ's soldier today and desert
   tomorrow and then be enlisted again--if it is indeed true that a man
   may be regenerated and then lose the Divine life and, upon repentance,
   be re-regenerated and re-re-re-re-re-regenerated--I know not how many
   times--I am not aware that this novelty is hinted at in my unrevised
   New Testament! There I read of being "born again," but not of being
   born again and again and again and again and again and again--I say I
   cannot find a trace of this in the Bible!

   On the other hand, I find that if the one regeneration fails, which is
   impossible, there would remain nothing else to be done! God's best work
   is broken down and He will never try it again. He has said, "It is
   impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the
   heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have
   tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if
   they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they
   crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an open
   shame. For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes oft upon it,
   and bring forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives
   blessings from God; but that which bears thorns and briers is rejected,
   and is near unto cursing; whose end is to be burned." You cannot
   re-salt the salt if it has once lost its savor. If, then, Grace does
   utterly depart, which I believe to be impossible, there remains no hope
   for such a one. God's supreme effort, according to that theory, has
   been made and failed!

   Now, there is nothing for it but that the land which has received the
   dew of Heaven and brought forth no fruit, is near unto cursing, whose
   end is to be burned. "But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of
   you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak." We
   have but made the supposition to show you the danger, upon whose

   brink you stand, and over whose verge you would slide if Grace did not
   prevent. If you, indeed, believe in Christ Jesus, set this to your
   seal, that He will keep you to the end! Whatever happens, "I am
   persuaded that neither things present, nor things to come, nor height,
   nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
   the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." For dear life hold
   on to the hope of final preservation, for there is a purifying,
   encouraging, stimulating power about that precious Truth of God! "He
   keeps the feet of His saints." "Be not moved away from the hope of the
   Gospel."

   We have a hope beyond this, for we believe that we shall experience the
   Resurrection. Though they fall down and men call them corpses, they are
   precious in the sight of the Lord. The grave shall be a refining pot
   out of which the pure metal of our purified body shall come forth. At
   the word of the Lord, the dry bones shall live--they shall be clothed
   with flesh--and skin shall come upon them, if, after that fashion, the
   body is to be raised. But if not--if the body is to assume another form
   and we are to be made like unto a Glory which as yet we cannot
   comprehend, then we may be sure of this-- that we shall so rise that
   mortality shall put on immortality and corruption shall give place to
   incorruption! In any case, our bodies shall rise again. The Grace of
   God secures the bodies as well as the souls of the saints. Christ
   bought not the half of a man, but the whole trinity of our manhood is
   His redeemed inheritance--spirit, soul and body shall dwell forever
   with Him--for He has redeemed our undivided manhood!

   Never give up that hope, either, concerning yourselves or your friends.
   Let nothing shake your confidence in the Resurrection! Let no
   philosophical explanation fritter it away. No other historical fact is
   so well attested as the Resurrection of Christ, which is the very
   cornerstone of our confidence. "For if the dead rise not, then is not
   Christ raised. And if Christ is not raised, your faith is vain; you are
   yet in your sins. Then they, also, which are fallen asleep in Christ
   are perished. If only in this life we have hope in Christ, we are, of
   all men, most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead and
   become the first fruits of them that slept."

   Often and often, when I am sorely beset with devilish temptations and
   insinuations as to the eternal hope of my soul and body, I fly to
   this--Jesus Christ did rise from the dead and, inasmuch as He rose from
   the dead, He has come back to tell us that there is another world and
   that not only our souls, but our bodies shall inherit a far more
   blessed condition than this present one! Hold on to this hope of the
   Gospel, and never let it go--

   "The Lord is risen! He lives!

   The First-born from the dead,

   To Him the Father gives

   To be creation's Head.

   O'er all forever reigning,

   Of death He holds the keys;

   And Hell--His might constraining--

   Obeys His high decrees.

   Flies now the gloom that shaded

   The vale of death to me;

   The terrors that invaded

   Are lost, O Christ, in Thee!

   The grave, no more appalling,

   Invites me to repose;

   Asleep in Jesus falling,

   To rise as Jesus rose."

   Then remember, you have the hope of the Second Advent. If Jesus comes
   before you die, you will meet Him--gladly meet and welcome the Son of
   God upon this earth! You shall be changed so that you shall be fit to
   inherit the incorruptible glories of the skies. You shall see your
   Redeemer when He stands in the latter day upon the earth. As Job said,
   "In my flesh shall I see God, whom my eyes shall see for myself, and
   not another." Have joy, then, at every thought of your Master's coming!
   Do not put it among dark prophecies or doubtful dreams. It is a clearly
   revealed Truth of God that Jesus will come again and take His people up
   to their eternal Home--"Therefore comfort one another with these
   words," and be not moved away from that hope of the Gospel which lies
   so sweetly in the Second Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ!

   And, once more, we have this hope--that when we have passed through all
   that concerns time and are in eternity, that shoreless, bottomless
   sea--there remains for us no fear or dread, but we shall be "forever
   with the Lord." I notice

   that certain of those who deny the eternity of future punishment are
   ready, for the sake of their notion, to pull down the battlements of
   Heaven, itself, and to make the joy of saints to be as short as the
   misery of sinners. I, for one, will not pawn Heaven in that fashion, to
   make sin cheap for the willfully impenitent! Once landed on that
   eternal shore, there are no storms to dread or hurricanes to fear for
   these frail boats of ours! There shall not a wave of trouble roll
   across our peaceful spirits when once we cast anchor in the "Fair
   Havens," in the Port of Peace forever!

   Be not dismayed as though there would be an after-probation, or a
   "purgatory," or a lim bus patrum, or any of those pretty places that
   have filled priests' pockets so long--and are now being newly vamped
   and produced by our proud thinkers as an aid to their pretty
   speculations! We will have no "purgatory" under any form--it is the
   larder of priests and the refuge of heresy-mongers--and there is not a
   word of it in God's Bible! We stand to the text--"So shall we be
   forever with the Lord." "The righteous shall go away into life
   eternal." There is "an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and
   that fades not away, reserved in Heaven for you." "Him that overcomes
   will I make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go no more
   out: and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the
   city of My God, which is New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven
   from My God: and I will write upon him My new name."

   "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the
   sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of
   the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains
   of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." "Be not
   moved away from the hope of the Gospel," as to the objects of that
   hope!

   II. But now, secondly, I charge you, Beloved, before God, that you BE
   NOT MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOPE

   OF THE GOSPEL AS TO THE GROUND OF THAT HOPE. And what is the ground of
   that hope? The ground of that hope is, first, the rich, free, Sovereign
   Grace of God because He has said, "I will have mercy on whom I will
   have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
   The Lord claims for Himself the prerogative of mercy and, as He can
   exercise it without the violation of His justice through the atoning
   Sacrifice of Christ, we joy and rejoice in the fact that men are not
   saved because of any natural goodness of disposition, or because of
   anything that they have done, or ever shall do!

   The children being not yet born, neither having done good nor evil, the
   Divine decree stood fast fixed in the Sovereign will and immutable
   counsels of Jehovah! And this is a good ground of hope for the very
   chief of sinners. If He has saved the dying thief--if He has saved the
   adulterer--if He has saved even the murderer, why should He not save
   me? He can if He will and He is exceedingly gracious, infinite in
   compassion and willing not the deaths of any, but that all should come
   to repentance! It is in the mercy of our God that all our hopes begin
   and the cause of that mercy is itself! The reason of Divine love is
   Divine love! Because God is gracious, therefore He bestows His Grace
   upon the undeserving and the lost. Be not moved away from this.

   The ground of our salvation is, next, the merit of Christ--what Christ
   is; what Christ has done--what Christ has suffered. This is the ground
   upon which God saves the sons of men. Even Cardinal Bellarmine, the
   mighty opponent of Luther--perhaps the best opponent that he had, whose
   eyes saw much of Gospel Light--once said this, "That albeit good works
   are necessary unto salvation, yet, inasmuch as no man can be sure that
   he has performed as many good works as will save him, it is, upon the
   whole, safest to trust, alone, in the merits and sufferings of Christ."
   Cardinal, the safest way suits me! If that is the best and safest, what
   better do any of us need? Where is the rest for our soul if the ground
   of our hope is to be what we are, or what we do, or what we feel? But
   when we fall back upon the finished work of Jesus Christ and believe in
   Him, whom God has set forth to be a Propitiation for sin, and not for
   ours only, but for the sins of the whole world--I say, when we fall
   back on Him--then we have something solid to rest upon!

   Our eyes cannot bear to look into eternity so long as we cling, in the
   least degree, to human merit! But when it is all put aside and we look
   to Him bleeding yonder on the Cross, then is there a "peace that passes
   all understanding," filling our hearts by Christ Jesus! Brothers and
   Sisters, if a man were to live in good works without a single sin for
   10,000 years, he would be well recompensed for that by half-an-hour of
   Heaven! How, then, can we expect to merit eternal bliss by any works of
   ours? Ah, no! The hope were vanity! Heaven is too precious a thing to
   be purchased by anything that we can, by any possibility, do--but it is
   not too great to be purchased by the blood of Christ! And when we come
   to His Atonement, our anchor holds abidingly. "Be not moved away from
   the hope of the Gospel."

   Another ground of our hope is this--that God has solemnly pledged that
   "whoever believes in Christ shall not perish, but shall have
   everlasting life." If, then, we really, and in very deed, believe in
   Jesus Christ and rest on Him, we cannot perish, for God cannot
   contradict Himself! Thus it is written--hear it and accept it--"He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." Those of us, then, who trust
   the Savior, and Him only--and have made confession of that trust in His
   own appointed way--know for sure that God's eternal veracity is staked
   upon our salvation! It is not possible that the Lord should cast away a
   Believer! Is it not written, "The just shall live by faith"? We live
   because we believe in the Ever-Living One! "He that believes in Him has
   everlasting life," Be not moved away from this Gospel hope which God,
   who cannot lie, has set before us--

   " The Covenant of the King of Kings

   Shall stand forever sure!

   Beneath the shadow of His wings

   His saints repose secure."

   Another ground of our hope is the Immutability of God. God changes not
   and, therefore, the sons of Jacob are not consumed. The Immutability of
   Christ also confirms our hope, for He is, "the same yesterday, and
   today, and forever." The unchanging power of His blood is a tower of
   strength to our faith--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood

   Shall never lose its power

   Till all the ransomed Church of God

   Is saved to sin no more."

   If God is Immutable, then those that believe in Him have an immutable
   hope--be sure that you never cast it away! But, once again, our hope of
   the Gospel is grounded in the Infallibility of Scripture. The Papist
   has an infallible pope, but we have an Infallible Bible. If that which
   is spoken in this Book is not true, neither is our hope sure! If these
   things are questionable, our confidence is questionable! But if this
   Word of God abides fast, forever and ever, though Heaven and earth
   should pass away, then he that believes and builds on this Infallible
   Truth may rejoice and stand fast! I beseech you, "be not moved away
   from the hope of the Gospel."

   III. So far have I come with all my heart and soul and I believe that
   you, dear Friends, the members of this Church, at any rate, have
   accompanied me. Now let us consider HOW WE MAY BE MOVED AWAY FROM THE
   HOPE OF THE GOSPEL unless Grace is given to prevent us. We may be moved
   from the hope of the Gospel in the following ways. Sometimes by a
   conceit of ourselves. You may get off the ground of confidence in Free
   Grace to think, "Now I am somebody. Have not I prayed at the Prayer
   Meeting? Did not friends say that they were edified by it? Have not I
   preached a wonderful sermon? Am I not generous? Have not I given large
   sums to the Church and to the poor? Am I not somebody?"

   Ah, you and the devil, together, can make a commotion about that and I
   have no doubt that all he tells you, you will very greedily suck in,
   for we like to be praised and, though the praise comes from Satan,
   himself, it is welcome to our proud flesh! Well, whenever we get to
   think we are somebody, we are moved away from the hope of the Gospel.
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Somebody says, "But I
   am not a sinner." Ah, then He did not come to save you! Do you say, "I
   was once a sinner, but I have grown so perfect that I no longer sin"?
   Do you? Then you are removed from that hope which belongs to those who
   confess and lament their sins! You unChristianize yourself as soon as
   you strike your name out of the list of SINNERS who are saved by the
   Savior's Grace! You are a sinner and Christ died to save you, but do
   not be moved away from the hope of the Gospel by a vain notion that you
   are no longer sinful! Christ came not to heal the whole, but those who
   are sick.

   Do not be moved away, on the other hand, by despondency. Satan does not
   mind which way you get off the Rock-- whether it is by jumping up or by
   jumping down--it is all the same to him, so long as you leave the Rock
   of your salvation. Many there are that go up in a balloon of conceit,
   while others are ready to roll down the steeps of despondency and
   despair. But be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel either one
   way or the other! The least sin ought to make you humble, but the
   greatest sin ought not to make you despair. If you are, even now, as
   big a sinner as any 50 men rolled into one, Christ can save you
   readily--no, has saved you if you put your trust in Him! But, on the
   other hand, if you presume that you are not guilty, or despairingly
   say, "I am guilty, but I dare not believe that He can forgive me," you

   are, in either case, moved away from the hope of the Gospel! May
   eternal mercy keep you hourly penitent and believing, for repentance
   and faith walk on either side of a Christian till he enters the pearly
   gates.

   You may be moved away from the hope of the Gospel, also, by false
   teaching. If, for instance, you do not believe Christ to be, "Light of
   light, very God of very God," you have moved away from our hope which
   depends upon His Godhead. If you think that the priest can save you,
   you are moved away from the one only Priest before whom all other
   priests must let their censers die out into blackness! ONLY JESUS
   CHRIST can save you! If you listen to any teaching which puts your
   working or your doing into the place of Christ, you are drinking in
   error and you will be removed from the hope of your calling, which is
   Free Grace, received by faith, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   You can be removed from the hope of your calling by hoping to live by
   feelings. Ah, there are many Christians who get tempted that way! They
   feel so happy and that is the reason why they believe that they are
   saved. That is not the reason why I believe I am saved. I am saved
   because I trust Christ--and if I were as miserable as misery, itself, I
   should be just as truly saved as if I were as happy as Heaven itself!
   It is faith that does it, not feeling! Faith is precious, feeling is
   fickle. Believing, we stand firm, but by feeling we are tossed about.
   True feeling follows faith and, as such, is valuable-- but faith is the
   root--and the life of the tree lies there, not in the branches and
   leaves, which may be taken away, and yet the tree will survive.

   Some have very joyous feelings. They swim in trances and deliriums and
   yet they are all wrong. Rest on Christ, whether it is bright day or
   dark night with you--though He slay you, trust in Him--as much trust in
   Him as if He pressed you to His bosom! Faith must abide though joy
   departs! If your feelings are down in the dust--if you feel as though
   you could not hold up your head or look towards Heaven--never mind
   that, but cling to the promise, feel what you may. Believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ, who came into the world to save sinners, and good
   feelings will follow, by-and-by, but, just now, your first business is
   this--"He that believes in Him is not condemned." "He that believes in
   Him has everlasting life," Stand to that hope of the Gospel!

   Many are moved away from the hope of their calling by a dazzle of
   intellect. They are content simply to believe in Jesus till they meet
   some fine man, a thinker with a big forehead and a large box which
   ought to be full of brains. We have not been inside to see what is
   there, but the preacher talks much of his thought and culture. He tells
   you that you are behind the age--that a faith which believes God might
   have done very well for the times of Cromwell and the roundhead
   Puritans, but that, nowadays, we are far in advance of all that kind of
   thing. Whenever a so-called "brother" dazzles you like that, let him
   dazzle! Let him shine as much as he likes! But, as for you, tell him
   that he who has once looked the sun in the face is not to be dazzled by
   a glowworm! Go back to your wax and dazzle your brother worms, but you
   cannot dazzle me!

   A man who once has come to know Christ experimentally and lives by
   faith upon the Son of God, may, if he likes, read all your essays and
   reviews, and all the articles in your Quarterlies which ridicule the
   power of faith, whether in living or in dying, and he will say, when he
   has read them all through, "This is all they know about it." I daresay
   that if a horse were to write a book, he would tell us that roast beef
   is exceedingly bad food to eat. "Well," we should say, "that is a very
   natural opinion for a horse! Let him keep to his oats and his hay." And
   when a man says that there is no power in prayer, he shows that he does
   not know anything about praying! Let him keep to what he knows and hold
   his tongue about what he does not know! He says that it cannot be, so
   we say, "But it is so"--and when we have tasted and handled it and
   known it--there is no dazzling us out of it by a sense of the great
   man's superiority of mind!

   I have often thought that those who cry up their own learning must have
   wonderfully little of it, for I have jotted down in my pocketbook that
   I never saw the Bank of England send its bullion anywhere with a number
   of bells upon the cart to say, "Here is bullion coming along!" But I
   have noticed that every dustman does that! When I hear the bells
   ringing so much about "culture," I say to myself, "Dust on!" If they
   had real diamonds on board, they would hold their tongues about them!
   At any rate, dust or diamonds, the load in these men's carts is nothing
   to us--we have a more sure word of testimony to which our experience
   has set its seal. We have believed in Christ Jesus and found salvation
   and, by God's Grace, we will not be moved away from the hope of our
   calling!

   Lastly, be not moved away by persecution, or by sneers, or by ridicule.
   The persecution of this present day is a small thing compared with what
   our forefathers suffered. Look at that picture of the amphitheatre, by
   Dore. All is over! Every seat is empty! The stars, like the eyes of
   God, are looking down upon the arena. There lie the bodies of the
   saints and

   there are the tigers and the lions prowling over the sanded floor,
   tearing the carcasses which they have slain. But the painter pictures a
   vision of angels descending from over the uttermost parapet of the
   amphitheatre--they are tenderly watching over those precious bodies,
   for they have triumphed! And from the mouths of the beasts they have
   gone to the thrones of the angels!

   Only hold fast where the saints held fast at the first, "in nothing,
   terrified by your adversaries." No more mind the advance of learning
   than they dreaded the universality of ignorance! We have to fight with
   both the ignorance of this world and the wisdom of it, too--"But the
   foolishness of God is wiser than man, and the weakness of God is
   stronger than man." How readily shall the Divine wisdom and power make
   an end of learned babblings! Be not moved away from the hope of your
   calling. "Cast not away your confidence" which has great recompense of
   reward. Be like the Grecian youth who took his shield to battle--let it
   be your glory and your defense. We would say to you what the Spartan
   mother said to her son--"Come back with your shield, or on it." Come
   back with the Gospel well strapped upon your arm like a golden shield,
   or, if you die, may it become your bier and may you be borne Home upon
   it as a steadfast Believer in Christ! But never be moved away from the
   hope of your calling, for so would your shield be vilely cast away.

   III. Lastly, WHY IS IT THAT WE CANNOT BE MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOPE OF
   THE GOSPEL? What would follow if we were? Well, first, we will not be
   moved away from the hope of our calling, for there is nothing better to
   take its place! A man would not think of going to Australia if he heard
   that the wages were less there than here, the expense of living greater
   and the people were poorer. "No," he would say, "I shall not jump out
   of the frying pan into the fire. I shall certainly stay where I am,
   rather than go farther and fare worse."

   Well, we are just of that mind. We do not see how we could improve
   ourselves. Jonathan Edwards, in one of his treatises, speaks somewhat
   to this effect--"If any man can prove this form of the Gospel to be
   untrue and a mere dream, the very best thing that he can do is to sit
   down and weep forever to think that he has disproved the brightest hope
   that ever shone upon the eyes of men." And that is so. To have the
   glorious hope that, believing in Christ, we are saved, is such a
   blessing and such a joy that nothing can compare with it!

   Where are the fields that can tempt away the sheep of Christ? Where is
   the shepherd that can vie with Him? Where is the light that is brighter
   than this eternal sun? Oh, you tempt us with your rattles like
   children, but, having become men, we despise them! What have you to
   offer of truth, of hope, of comfort, of joy equal to what we possess?
   Let us, each one, sing our answer to the tempter--

   "You only, Sovereign of my heart,

   My refuge, my almighty Friend,

   And can my soul from You depart,

   On whom, alone, my hopes depend?

   Let earth's alluring joys combine,

   While You are near, in vain they call!

   One smile, one blissful smile of Yours,

   My dearest Lord, outweighs them all!

   Your name, my inmost powers adore,

   You are my life, my joy, my care.

   Depart from You? 'Tis death--'tis more,

   'Tis endless ruin, deep despair!" Remember, too, that if we are moved
   away from the hope of our calling, we shall soon be in bondage. A man
   may be as merry as a lark if he believes in Christ for salvation. But
   let him leave that and, before long, he will be as dull as an owl! What
   is there that can give us joy apart from Christ? Are we not bound in
   chains of doubt when once we leave the way of Sovereign Grace through
   believing in Christ? If we are moved away from the hope of our calling,
   we cannot grow. A tree that is frequently moved usually dies--growth
   there cannot be! And a man who begins in the spirit and hopes to be
   made perfect by the flesh. A man who begins in Free Grace and then gets
   to relying on his own works. A man who begins by trusting in Christ and
   then makes confession to a priest. A man who rests in the precious
   blood and then dabbles in sacraments and hopes to find salvation
   there--he can never grow in Grace!

   He is whirled about with every oar. Every tide of doctrine puts him up
   stream or down stream. He can make no progress. And what good can such
   a man do? He cannot influence others beneficially, for he teaches one
   thing, today, and

   another, tomorrow. He says that God has saved him and the next day he
   doubts it. He says that the Atonement is full and free, but tomorrow he
   says that penance is to be performed. He cannot bless others--he does
   not know the way to blessing. Besides, if we were moved away from the
   hope of our calling, what mean, miserable wretches we would be, for we
   should have deserted our Savior! I wonder where I could hide my
   dishonorable head if I once came here to preach salvation by the works
   of the flesh and not by the Grace of God! I hope that you would hiss me
   from the platform! And I hope that you will so treat anybody that shall
   succeed me, when I am gone, who shall preach to you any other Gospel
   than that which you have received!

   Hold fast, with all your might, right solemnly to the grand old faith,
   for if you do not, in rejecting that way of salvation, you reject
   yourselves! What did Christ die for, if we can be saved in some other
   way? Why did He pour out His blood if there is a cheaper method to win
   the skies? Why did He go down into the depths of death-shade, if you
   can force your way to Heaven by your own endeavors without Him? No,
   no--we will stand fast where we are, resting only and alone upon Jesus
   Christ our Savior! For us to leave the plan of salvation--and with this
   I close--is something like a soldier entrenched in an impregnable
   fortress accepting an invitation to come out of it! You remember how
   the black monarch, who has been so much run after in England, said that
   our soldiers ought to come out of the entrenchments?

   They were rats, he said, to hide behind earthworks. If they would only
   come out, he would destroy them! But our soldiers were wise enough not
   to venture into the open until the proper time. So the world, the
   flesh, the devil and error say, "Come out! Come out! You talk about an
   Infallible Scripture and an Almighty Savior and a simple faith in Him.
   Come out and fight us fairly on the level." Yes, but we do not see it
   and we shall never attempt it! We are like the little coney, of whom
   Solomon speaks. He hid himself among the rocks and, the sportsman, I
   have no doubt, said, "Why don't you come out, little coney? Come, and
   let me be your friend." But the coney, though he was feeble, was wise,
   and he hid himself in the rock all the more, because a stranger invited
   him out. Do the same when Satan cries, "Come away and be free. Be a
   man! Do not be always trusting in authority." "No," you say, "I shall
   stay where I am."

   As I was riding along in the south of France one day, I saw pair of
   fine birds overhead. The driver called out in the French tongue,
   "Eagles!" Yes, and there was a man below, with a gun, who was wishful
   to get a nearer acquaintance with the eagles, but they did not come
   down to oblige him! He pointed his rifle at them, but his shots did not
   reach half way, for the royal birds kept above. The higher air is the
   fit dominion for eagles! Up there is the eagle's playground, where he
   plays with the callow lightning! Up above the smoke and clouds he
   dwells. Stay there, eagles! Stay there! If men can get you within
   range, they mean no good to you. Keep up, Christians! Keep up in the
   higher element, resting in Jesus Christ, and do not come down to find a
   perch for yourself among the trees of philosophy! Whatever we do, let
   us never leave the way of the Truth of God, of peace, of safety!

   We are going along the King's Highway and the thieves on the side of
   the road say, "Come off the highway! It is so dull and monotonous. Come
   into the woods! We will show you fair flowers, ferny dells and quiet
   caves. Come, listen to the birds that sing all day and all night, too.
   Come with us." We heed you not--he that travels along the King's
   Highway is under the King's protection--but he that wanders into the
   dark mountains and lonesome woods may take care of himself. We shall do
   as we have done--follow the way that leads from the banishment--the way
   of trusting in the Savior and in Him, alone!

   As you hold to the faith, so may God bless and enrich you. As with
   simple heart you plod along the road that leads to Heaven by the
   righteousness of the Son of God, may the Lord be with you and comfort
   you. But if you turn back, woe unto you! A curse will fall upon you in
   that day of shame and crime! The Lord keep you, that you may keep the
   faith. Amen.

The General Convocation Around Mount Zion

   (No. 1689)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 5, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Butyou are come unto mountZion, and unto the city of the living God,
   the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the
   general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in
   Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men
   made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the
   blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things than that of Abel."
   Hebrews 12:22-24.

   THE whole passage will be considered, but our special central text will
   be verse twenty-three-- "To the general assembly and church of the
   first-born, which are written in Heaven." Paul is displaying the
   superiority of the New Covenant to the old. He tells us what Israel,
   after the flesh, came to at their best in the morning hours of the Law
   and what the first-born after the Spirit have come to under the Gospel.
   He pictures the great assembly of the chosen people round about Mount
   Sinai and then His Inspired mind describes an infinitely larger and
   happier gathering, to which all Believers have come, around Mount Zion.
   Not only the Hebrews to whom he was writing, but all the people of God
   are gathered together in one general assembly, of which the blessed God
   is the center. Paul shows us the joyful difference between the two
   gatherings and the feelings and pursuits of those who compose them.

   What we shall need, this morning, is a little careful attention to the
   deep meaning of the text and an intensely earnest desire to actually
   enter into the enjoyment of the privileges which are herein set before
   us. Our text contains an incalculable wealth of meaning--it is written
   according to God's riches in Glory by Christ Jesus. Surely it was
   written as with a pen of diamond upon plates of gold set with jewels!
   May God, by His Grace, lead us fully into it. We would not only speak
   of privilege as possible, but would say with Paul, "We are come unto
   it." As surely as we are not come to the terrors of the Law, so surely
   we are come to the blessings of the Gospel!

   Read in verse 18, "You are not come," and then in verse 22, "But you
   are come." We do not only hear of Zion and her festivities, but we are
   come to them! We do not merely know the letter of the Gospel, but we
   have come into the inner and spiritual meaning of it by personal
   enjoyment. "We are come." I would ring out those words as a sort of
   musical accompaniment to the Truths of God uttered. All through the
   sermon let our hearts rejoicingly say, "We are come!" "We are come!" We
   have obtained, by faith, all that which is set before us in the text!

   I. First, I want to set out, as I may be able, A CONTRAST PRESENTED IN
   THE ENTIRE PASSAGE which we have read--a contrast between the economy
   of Law and the economy of Grace. Every good thing is enhanced in value
   by its opposite. Light is all the brighter to eyes which have wept in
   darkness. Food is all the sweeter after you have known hunger. And Zion
   is all the fairer because of Sinai. The contrast between Free Grace and
   Law makes Grace appear the more precious to minds that have known the
   rigor of the Commandments.

   The contrast presented here is sevenfold. It may be that the idea of
   this sevenfold contrast first occurred to Bengel, that prince of
   critics, but I have ventured to differ from his form of it and I hope
   that in so doing I have set forth the contrast as to the seven things
   more clearly than he has done, so that even the humblest here will
   catch each point and retain each contrast in his memory. Notice the
   contrasts. First, as to place (v. 18), "You are not come unto the mount
   that might be touched." Verse 22--"but you are come unto mount Zion,
   and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem." Behold
   Sinai with its rugged crags--scarcely had a human foot ever trod it,
   perhaps, until that hour in which Jehovah descended upon it in
   splendor--it had remained a virgin peak which the foot of man had never
   polluted.

   There was no habitation of man upon it, neither did it yield pasture
   for flocks. The Mount of God stood out in terrible sublimity against
   the sky, holding communion with the stars, but refusing to deal with
   men. It was sublime, but stern and tempest-beaten. God came upon Sinai
   with His Law and the dread mountain became a type of what the Law would

   be to us. It has given us a grand idea of holiness, but it has not
   offered us a pathway thereto, nor furnished a weary heart with a
   resting place, nor supplied a hungry soul with spiritual food. It can
   never be the place where congregated multitudes erect a city for
   themselves and a Temple for the living God--it is not the shrine
   offellowship, but the throne of authority and justice.

   The Jews under the Law had that stern hill for their center and they
   compassed it about with pale countenances and trembling knees. We
   gather to quite another center, even unto the palace-crowned steep of
   Zion. There David dwelt of old and there David's Lord revealed Himself.
   The hill of Zion rose above the city of Jerusalem and the two,
   together, formed the favored spot where Jehovah deigned to dwell in
   solemn state in the midst of His chosen nation--"For the Lord has
   chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation." There the service
   of His sanctuary was carried on and around it clustered all the palaces
   of Judah and the habitations of the chosen people. It was called "the
   City of Vision" and the City of Peace. God dwelt in the midst of her
   and, therefore, she was not moved.

   "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion."
   "God is known in her palaces for a refuge." "God shall help her, and
   that right early." This is a type of the dispensation in which the Lord
   comes to man in a vision of peace and manifests Himself in forgiving
   Grace. The Lord dwells with men in the Person of the Man, Christ Jesus,
   and we come to Him and find our habitation in Him in all generations.
   Even as the sparrow has found a house and the swallow a nest for
   herself, where she may lay her young, so do we come to dwell at the
   altars of God, in the city which His Grace has founded and His power
   has garrisoned.

   The places in their contrast are full of teaching. This mountain that
   might not be touched, we are told, in the next place, "burned with
   fire." God made the mountain melt and flow down. The Lord also
   thundered in the heavens and the Highest gave His voice--hailstones and
   coals of fire." Sinai was altogether on a smoke; innumerable lightning
   flashed forth around the summit of the hill and Jehovah revealed
   Himself in flaming fire. What, then, have Believers come to, instead of
   fire? Why, to another form of fire--to "an innumerable company of
   angels"--"He makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flame of fire."
   Some of those bright beings are called seraphim, or, burning ones, for
   they come and go like flames of fire!

   It must have been terrible to look up to Sinai and see it casting forth
   its flames, but it is with delight that we look towards the angels who
   excel in strength and spend that strength in the service of the Lord
   and His people! These are a wall of fire round about us. "Are they not
   all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be
   heirs of salvation?" Has He not given them charge over us to keep us in
   all our ways? It is most glorious to think of the position every
   Believer occupies today, for we are all come where the hosts of God
   encamp about us! David said, "The chariots of God are twenty thousand,
   even thousands of angels." Daniel said, "Ten thousand times ten
   thousand stood before Him." The Prophet flings his thousands about as
   if they were mere units!

   Think of Jehovah's legions! Jesus speaks of the Father sending Him 12
   legions of angels in a moment. The Lord Jehovah has more legions to
   send to one spot than the Roman Empire could have mustered in all its
   length and breadth. And every single warrior of these legions is able
   to destroy a whole army in a single night, as one of them did when he
   smote Sennacherib. What mighty spirits, what flaming spirits, what pure
   spirits, what glorious spirits they are! And we have communion with
   them! We have come to an innumerable company of angels. We do not
   always realize it as we should, but these loving spirits are about us
   as surely as they were around Jacob in his dream. If our eves were
   opened, we would see horses of fire and chariots of fire round about
   the Lord's servants!

   "Millions of spiritual creatures walk this earth, both when we wake and
   when we sleep." God comes to us by them-- "He rode upon a cherub and
   did fly." Angels contend against evil spirits and are our defenders.
   This, then, is our position--we are come to the countless hosts of our
   Father's messengers and not to devouring flames. Pursue the contrast
   and you find on Mount Sinai that there was blackness, doubtless made
   the more intensely black as the vivid lightning flashed out from it.
   "You are not come unto blackness," says Paul. What is the contrast to
   this? "But you are come to the general assembly and church of the
   first-born, which are written in Heaven."

   Perhaps you do not, for a moment, see any contrast, but I will soon
   show it to you. Blackness is the symbol of sorrow, it is the garb of
   mourning. Everywhere we associate blackness with grief, but now Paul
   sets before us the grandest embodiment ofjoy! The word for general
   assembly in the original suggests a far-reaching festivity. "You are
   come to the panequris--to a solemn festive assembly, comparable to the
   National Convocation of the Greeks which was held around

   the foot of Mount Olympus every four or five years, when all the Greeks
   of different states came together to keep up the national feeling by
   festivities and friendly competitions which I will explain further on.

   Instead of the colors of grim death, we see the joyous congregating of
   all the clans, the glad union of all the children of God who are
   scattered abroad! We, this day, in loving fellowship with the Church,
   are come to the great gathering of God, the holy convocation of saints
   of every tongue, the central home of all the tribes of His great
   family! It is a gathering for solemn purposes, for it is a "Church."
   But still for joyous purposes, for it is a national holiday. A solemn
   joy, a holy delight pervades the atmosphere which the one great Church
   of God is breathing! You say to me, "Do you mean the Church in Heaven?
   " Yes, I mean the Church in Heaven, but on earth, too! Why divide it?
   There is only one Church!

   Here and there, earth and Heaven, make a little division to our senses,
   but there is no division in the mind of God-- He sees one general
   assembly of all His people, of all nations, kindreds, people and
   tongues. Cannot you realize the scene and note the Glory of it? Cannot
   your mind come to the general assembly? Cannot you feel that you are
   standing in company with all the chosen of God of every age, clime and
   place, keeping high holiday with them before the Most High, singing
   continually with them His praises and doing Him service with delight? I
   am so glad not to be alone, but to be one of the general assembly and
   Church of the first-born, which are written in Heaven, that I feel
   ready to shout for joy! What a contrast this is between the blackness
   of coming sorrow by the Law and the joyous whiteness of the garments of
   those who believe!

   Follow the next point of contrast and you have darkness mentioned. "Nor
   unto blackness and darkness." The cloud on Sinai was so dark as to
   obscure the day, except that every now and then the lightning flash lit
   up the scene. What are we come to in contrast to that darkness? "To God
   the Judge of all." Possibly it does not strike you with joy when I
   mention it, but this is, perhaps, the most joyous of all the clauses of
   the passage! "God is Light and in Him is no darkness at all." What a
   contrast to the darkness of the Law is a reconciled God! "Oh, but," you
   say, "He is there as the Judge of all and that makes us tremble," Why?
   Why? It makes me leave off trembling when I think that I am come "to
   God the Judge of all," that Christ has brought me near, even to the
   Judge, so that 1 have nothing to dread from Him! What can the Judge do
   but pronounce sentence of acquittal upon the man for whom Christ has
   made expiation? What can He do to harm us?

   Nothing! But much to help us for, rolling every slander away, He will
   make the righteous to shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their
   Father! We are standing, today, in the Presence of that great God who
   looks upon His people with delight and awards them their several
   crowns. In this great gathering of the first-born, they wrestle with
   sin, they run the race of perseverance, they proclaim His honor and
   sing His praises. This is, in fact, the highest delight of all the
   saints-- to gather unto their God! And what follows next? Why,
   tempest--it is said, "You are not come unto the mount that might be
   touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness,
   and tempest." All over the top of Sinai there swept fierce winds and
   terrible tornadoes, for the Lord was there!

   All Heaven seemed convulsed when God did rend it and descended in
   majesty upon the sacred mountain! But what do you and I see? The very
   reverse of tempest-- "The spirits of just men made perfect," serenely
   resting! What more is there for them to do? They are perfect! They have
   fought the fight. They have run the race, they are crowned, they are
   full of ecstatic bliss--the light of God is on their brows, the Glory
   of God is reflected from their faces--everything like a storm is far
   gone from them! They have reached the fair haven and are tossed with
   tempest no more. Today you and I have come where we hold fellowship
   with the immutably serene who are resting in the Glory which God has
   appointed them! This is a part of the splendid pageantry of the
   Covenant of Grace, and we are come to it--

   "Even now by faith we join our hands With those that went before And
   greet the blood-besprinkled bands On the eternal shore."

   Faith has brought us into that one communion in which all saints live,
   whether they are on earth or in the Father's house above. Follow the
   contrast further and you come to the sound of a trumpet. This resounded
   from the top of Sinai. Clarion notes most clear and shrill rang out,
   again and again--the high commands of the thrice-holy God. You are not
   come to that. Instead of a trumpet, which signifies war and the stern
   summons of a king, you are come unto "Jesus the Mediator of the New
   Covenant," and the silver tones of, "Come unto Me, all you that labor
   and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Here is nothing to
   disturb the ears, for, "He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His
   voice to be heard

   in the streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax
   shall He not quench." No message thunders out, "Stand off!" but holy
   affection cries, "Come, and welcome!" God has come to you in the Person
   of the Mediator, the Man, Christ Jesus." In the Person of Jesus we see
   nothing to alarm, but everything to encourage. Oh, for faith to see,
   with joy, the Mediator of that New Covenant which does not so much
   command as work in us to will and to do! Is not this one of the
   choicest blessings of the position we now occupy, that instead of the
   trumpet, we hear the sweet and saving voice of Jesus bidding us repose
   in His salvation and be eternally blessed?

   The seventh contrast lies in this--together with the trumpet, there
   sounded out a Voice--a Voice which was so terrible that they asked that
   they might not hear it again. They cowered down under it like poor,
   frightened children, terrified by the penetrating sound! They could not
   endure another word! They begged that the voice would be silent. We
   have come to another voice--the voice of "the blood of sprinkling--that
   speaks better things than that of Abel." There is a voice from Zion,
   there is a voice that rolls over the heads of the innumerable company
   of angels, a voice of the Lord that is full of majesty and exceedingly
   comfortable to the "general assembly and Church of the first-born" who
   know the joyful sound! The blessed Word speaks life, pardon,
   reconciliation, acceptance, joy, eternal bliss! Happy people, whose
   ears have discerned this heavenly voice! "They shall walk, O Lord, in
   the light of Your Countenance." The more of this voice the better--it
   never wearies the ear, nor distresses the heart--

   "Blood has a voice to pierce the skies, 'Revenge,' the blood of Abel
   cries! But the dear blood of Jesus slain Speaks peace as loud from
   every vein." We are come to it, for we have been washed in it and its
   sweet, prevailing note is filling our heart with music even now!

   Now, dear Friends, I have set forth the contrast and I want you to
   think it out by the help of the ever-blessed Spirit. To all that was
   transacted at Sinai the people could not come, nor did they wish to
   come--they kept at a distance, for they were afraid--but to all that is
   displayed on Zion we may come! No, what is better, I hope we can say
   with the Apostle, "We are come." We now enter into it and delight in
   it--it has become our life and our joy! All that the people saw at
   Sinai distressed them. All that we see at Zion electrifies us with
   delight--we scarcely know how to bear ourselves as we think of the
   wondrous Glory of love!

   We are not warned off; we are not driven into fear and bondage, but we
   come unto the Mountain of God and there we feast, rejoicing in Him,
   even in all that He is and does! The veil is torn from the top to the
   bottom and we have access to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. There I
   leave the instructive contrast. May the Holy Spirit bless it.

   II. I beg you, in the second place, to follow me in what may not,
   perhaps, so much strike you, but it is certainly worthy of your
   attention, namely, A COMPARISON IN OUR MORE CENTRAL TEXT. Our position
   is that, "We are come to the general assembly and Church of the
   first-born which are written in Heaven." It is a comparison, not with
   anything Jewish, for that would not have been suitable, but with a
   Gentile festival, which more readily lent itself to the Apostle's great
   thought.

   Let me give you, first of all, a rough sketch. In Greece, in her
   happier times, in order to preserve a national unity, the various
   states, kingdoms, or republics which constituted Greece proper, held,
   at the foot of Olympus, a great gathering to which none came as
   participators except citizens of the various Greek nationalities. The
   object of the gathering was that every part of the Greek nature might
   be educated and displayed and the unity of the Greek race be
   remembered. Poets came and sang verses which they had composed with
   care; orators stood and discoursed to gain the crown for eloquence; men
   of all kinds of mental attainments were there emulating each other. At
   the same time, all sorts of athletic exercises for the development of
   the body were going on.

   The territory in which this was held was considered to be sacred.
   Though the states were often at war with one another, they never
   carried the war into that particular region. It was a quiet, peaceful,
   neutral spot. Do you not glimpse a parallel? No man was allowed to
   compete in any of the exercises and contests except he had been at
   least 10 months or more in preparation for them. Those who were
   conquerors had no gold given them as reward--a simple crown of olive
   leaves was all--but it was thought a most sufficient reward for the
   most exhausting feats and for the greatest self-denial--such as
   resistance unto blood and dislocation of bones.

   When the conquerors went home, we are told that they were drawn into
   their own cities with horses in great state, and the gates were not
   opened to them, but a breach was made in the city wall that they might
   be admitted with unusual

   pomp. The whole business of the festival was held in high esteem by the
   Greek people and religion lent its rites and ceremonies to make the
   gathering the more imposing. The Apostle, I do not doubt, had seen it.
   At any rate, the words which he uses properly and naturally suggest it.
   Think for a moment! Before us stands the city which is the center of
   this unrivalled congregation of the first-born! Jerusalem stands in her
   place and the Acropolis, Mount Zion, looks down upon the scene. To the
   city of the living God, the living children of God have come!

   Look how the Presence of the Lord brings together an innumerable
   company! Far as imagination can fly, the space is filled with shining
   ones who compose the court of the Most High! Observe the free-born
   burgesses of the holy city, enrolled by God that they may participate
   in the exercises which make illustrious this noblest of all assemblies!
   Look, yonder are the runners and the wrestlers! Perhaps you do not
   think there can be much festivity about engagements which involve so
   much of endurance as running and striving for the mastery, but your
   Greeks were of another mind and these contests were a part of the
   pleasures of the festival.

   How much I wish that we could look upon all the conflicts, sufferings
   and troubles of this mortal life as occupations of the great festive
   gathering which is now being held in Heaven and in earth around the
   city of our God. Look! Yonder is the Judge, the great Umpire of His
   people's efforts, ready to award the crowns! And who are those sitting
   in their seats and looking on? These are they who have taken their turn
   in these grand displays and, having won their crowns, there they sit,
   "the spirits of the just made perfect," "the cloud of witnesses."
   Today, my Brothers and Sisters, you are participating in that great
   international gathering of all the people of God! Are you not glad to
   be here? When I was visiting one of our sick friends, he uttered a
   sentence which stuck to me and, indeed, suggested my subject.

   He said, "I have had some education for Heaven in attending the
   Tabernacle." "How is that?" "Because I have become used to worshipping
   with a great company of godly people--used to joining in the songs of
   great multitudes--and I shall feel at home among the number that no man
   can number." Yes, it is sweet to go up with your multitude who keep
   holy day! The number adds a charm to your worship and gives to our
   hearts a tone of exhilaration which otherwise they might have lacked.
   Behold, then, the countless bands of the redeemed assembled around the
   chosen mountain! Brethren, you are not around a blazing mountain, nor
   do you compose a trembling assembly of persons who, like slaves, are
   afraid of their great and terrible master! You are come, today, to the
   great festival in which earth and Heaven unite!

   That assembly is one and indivisible. Around the Throne of the Most
   High your Apostle represents all the saints as gathered to hold one
   glorious feast. "Has it begun?" you ask. Yes, it is going on, now, and
   you are come to it--if you are living by faith as you ought to
   live--you are now engaged in it. "Oh, but," you say, "I am wrestling."
   That is a part of the festival! "I never thought of that," cries one.
   But it is even so. When the national meeting was held at Olympus, there
   were contests of all kinds and these were not regarded with sorrow, but
   with exultation. "What? Would you have me look at my suffering and
   wrestling as part of a festival?" Yes! I would have you glory in them
   and view them in the same high and heroic light in which the Apostle
   sets them forth in the figure before us!

   The exercises are now proceeding. The sacred orators are now doing
   their part--you heard the singers just now. I count it a high honor to
   hold your attention while I tell you of the Glory of my Lord and Master
   who, Himself, contended here on earth and endured the Cross, despising
   the shame! Thousands of others are discoursing as I do, for the
   assembly abounds in the rich gifts of utterance. And everywhere, chosen
   spokesmen are telling out the wonderful wisdom and love of God! Many at
   this meeting have hymns to sing, or books to write, and all are doing
   their best to make the assembly a notable one! Look at another class of
   chosen men and mark how they are struggling with temptation, warring
   against error, running in the course, or bearing heavy weights! Yes,
   that is all a part of the grand display which the Lord is making before
   all intelligent beings, wherein the power of love, the energy of faith,
   the splendor of Grace and the triumph of good are being made manifest
   to the Glory of God by us!

   "Oh," you say, "I cannot look at my sorrows in such a light." No doubt
   the men who were wrestling or racing found that, for the present, it
   was not joyous. Yet they did not shun it, for they had earnestly
   desired the day when they might be allowed to share in the national
   display. They counted it a high honor to be permitted to take part,
   even, in the roughest contests. None but a Greek could do so. You,
   also, have put your name down for a place in the Church of God--this is
   a high honor, to which none but the twice-born, whose names are written
   in Heaven, can be admitted-- accept the hardship with the honor!

   "Oh, but," you say, "I have run a long time, I have run for 50 years!"
   Splendid running, this! I do not believe that even at Olympus they ever
   saw a man run for 50 years at a stretch. Keep on! Do not suffer the
   glory of the day to fail! You say this sheds a strange light upon
   Christian life. Say, rather, a blessed light which will delight the
   eyes and hearts of enthusiastic Believers. The Father of all takes
   delight in this assembly--it is the joy of Christ to look down upon His
   champions, whose faith He sustains, whose faith He accepts! He is
   saying to devils, "Look on and see what lovers of right can do!" Look
   on, you innumerable company of angels, and see what Grace can do in the
   hearts of poor, feeble men and women, making them strong to do
   exploits!

   My Brothers and Sisters, see what feats were performed of old! Read the
   11th chapter of this Epistle. Remember how the Lord's own elect stood
   at the stake and burned to the death without yielding? Think how they
   were stretched on racks, but would not deny their Lord! They were
   dragged at the heels of wild horses. They were roasted over slow fires,
   or were stung to death by wasps! Their endurance is more glorious than
   all that can be told of the heroes of Greece! What wonders men have
   done through Grace! God has glorified His name by what He has enabled
   men to bear and do! This our Lord would have us look at and unite in!
   Now, what can we do? God help us to do our best. Oh for Grace to suffer
   more, to give more, to work more, to be more firm in resisting
   temptation, more pure in all godly conversation! Champions, shall the
   day of Glory decline? Your feast has scarcely reached its greatest
   day--let not courage, or patience, or faith begin to flag. May we be
   jealous for the honor of the chosen race to which we belong.

   Our text adds to the term, "general assembly," that of the "Church of
   the first-born." "Oh," say the commentators, "this is tautology!" Not
   so. The Apostle felt bound, after having used such a remarkable
   comparison, to call us back to the solemnity of the matter and remind
   us that it is "a Church" which is gathered. You and I have come to a
   great Church meeting where all the saints of God are met at this
   moment. What makes a Church? An ecclesia? These words may help
   you--they are, first, a people chosen. Next, a people called. Then a
   people culled. Then a people consecrated. And then a people
   congregated. So do they become the Church of the living God--separated
   unto God by His electing love; called out from the world by His
   effectual calling; culled out by being separated through a work of
   Grace; congregated and gathered together into one in Christ--and
   forevermore consecrated to Divine service!

   This is what you and I have come to. Oh for words with which to speak
   our joy for admission into such a company! Brothers and Sisters, notice
   that Paul was writing to Hebrews, and the Hebrews, no doubt, gloried in
   their great feasts, when all the tribes came up to Jerusalem. Yes, Paul
   knew all about those feasts and all that they meant--but this is an
   assembly to which the Jewish ritual offers us no parallel. Hebrews come
   to that festival, but it is by no means peculiarly theirs. "They shall
   come from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the
   south." Just as at Olympus, Spartans, Thebans, Athenians and
   Corinthians all came and melted into Greeks, so will they come--Jews,
   Gentiles, men of this Church, and of that--and they will all melt into
   one general assembly! It is not a peculiar assembly of Hebrews, but a
   general assembly of all the first-born.

   Note, dear Friends, the individuals who compose the company. They are
   all high born, for they are all first-born. There is but one
   emphatically first-born, namely, Jesus Christ, Himself. But being one
   with Him, we become the firstborn of God through the new birth! By our
   union to Christ and by the blessed processes of Grace, we are made and
   known to be the first-born of God. Now the first-born among men had the
   ascendancy and sway in the household, even as, "the meek shall inherit
   the earth." The day comes when righteousness shall be to the fore. The
   first-born had the excellency. "Reuben, you are My first-born, My
   might, and the beginning of My strength, the excellency of dignity, and
   the excellency of power."

   The saints are the excellent of the earth, in whom is all our delight.
   The first-born were consecrated to God and we, too, are dedicated
   persons, set apart unto God, "for you are not your own; you are bought
   with a price." The first-born were redeemed--so have we been purchased
   with the precious blood of Christ. The first-born had the estate, the
   throne and the priesthood. Vast is the inheritance of the first-born of
   God--all things are theirs--they are heirs of God, joint-heirs with
   Jesus Christ. To the first-born belonged honor--"Such honor have all
   the saints." There are younger brothers in every family who receive
   comparatively little if they happen to be descended from great lords.
   But there are no younger Brothers in the family of God. They are all
   first-born, all heirs! And what is wonderful to tell--each one of them
   has all the estate, for it is so infinite that, though if I have all,
   you can have all, too--an innumerable company of this blessed
   first-born race can have the whole of God to be their portion forever
   and ever!

   But then it is added that they are enrolled. As I have already told
   you, they enrolled the competitors in the Greek festivals and a man
   took care, months before, to get his name set down for a place. Thus
   God has enrolled the names of His people. They are written--where? In
   the earth? No--the wicked are written in the earth! But the names of
   the Lord's people are written in Heaven! In the Divine decree that
   never changes, in the Divine heart that never alters, in the Divine
   memory that never fails, in the Divine thought that never forgets--all
   the names of the godly are written! I do not know how to set this out,
   but I want you to feel as if you were standing, this morning, in that
   great assembly with spiritual exercises going on around you--such as
   struggling against sin, striving for the mastery over error, patiently
   enduring pain and working holy work.

   The Judge is looking on, with the crowns in His hands, ready to place
   them upon each conqueror's head. The air breathes perfume and is full
   of music, for all around is joy. When a man suffers, if he looks upon
   it as punishment, he feels like a criminal tied up to be lashed. But if
   he knows that his path is a necessary part of the road to victory, he
   bears it without complaint. If we all understand that this period is
   not comparable to a battle, of which the result hangs in the balance,
   but comparable to those deeds of prowess with which of old men
   celebrated a victory, then the face of things is altered and our toils
   are transfigured! Angels come down and poor men and women are lifted
   up, triumphing in patience and giving pleasure to their Lord. They are
   bringing honor to that favored city which God has prepared for them. We
   are here amid the throng, not as spectators, only, but sharing in the
   overflowing joy! Oh, the bliss of feeling that even now, Heaven is
   begun below and the sufferings of this present life are but a part of
   the Glory of the Lord manifested in His people!

   III. We will conclude by noticing the third point, which is--A COMING
   TO BE ENJOYED. This is the essence of it all--"We are come" unto this
   general assembly and Church of the first-born. How, then, do we come? A
   difficulty meets us at the outset. You that have never thought of this
   great assembly which my imagination and heart have tried to picture
   this morning--you cannot come. The porter stands at the barrier and
   keeps you back. You cry, "Let me come!" No, you may not come. This
   festival is only for the first-born and you are not that by nature. You
   must first be born again and become one of the first-born. The Spirit
   of God must make you a new creature in Christ Jesus--and then the
   porter will open the wicket and say--"Come in, and welcome." Which part
   are you going to take in this great gathering? Will you fight against
   sin? Will you wrestle against error? Will you run for the crown? Will
   you sing, or speak? What will you do in this great congress of all the
   saints? But these questions do not apply until, first, you are born
   from above!

   Next, you must be enrolled, Your name must be written down, not in our
   Church Book, but in the Church Book of the Lord above. I would to God
   that some of you would be moved to say, "Oh, that my name were written
   there!" The name of every Believer is upon Christ's heart, hands and
   shoulders. If you believe that Jesus is the Christ. If you are trusting
   in Him, your name is among the enrolled! If you believe in Him that
   rose, again, from the dead, and He is the Author and Finisher of your
   faith, then come and welcome--you are one of those whose names are
   written in Heaven! The general assembly would miss you if you were
   absent--yes, Heaven, itself, cannot be perfect if you do not enter its
   ranks--for all the saints must be there, or else it will not be a
   perfect gathering! Would you have them mourning in Heaven and saying,
   "Such an one is not here!" Why, Heaven's songs would be suspended if
   one child of the family were left in the outer darkness! There must be
   a believing in Jesus and then there will be a reception into the chosen
   assembly!

   But you say, again, "How am I to get into that assembly? I hope I have
   been born again and that my name is written among the Lord's redeemed
   people, but I still do not feel as if I were in the festive
   gathering--I feel more like one in the arena contending for very life."
   So did many at Olympus. They were fighting and wrestling and, while so
   engaged, they endured great hardships, yet their valiant strife was a
   part of the grand scene and they would not have been absent for any
   reason. So, dear Friends, what we must do is this--first, God helping
   us, let us partake in the joy of the one Church! Why should I not be as
   happy as yon angels are? They have not so much reason to be happy as I
   have, for Jesus never took their nature, or died for them--

   "Never did angels taste above Redeeming Grace and dying love." And you,
   spirits of the just, why should not I participate in all your joy? What
   blessing belongs to you which does not, also, belong to me, except the
   one delight of absolute perfection? Am I not saved? Am I not washed? Am
   I not clothed? Am I not a child of God--in all things, just what you
   are, except that one finishing stroke--which I am sure to

   have in due time when I have concluded my wrestling and my running? Let
   us joy in God today and, surely, even in Heaven they know no greater
   bliss than this! To joy in God through Jesus Christ our Lord is
   happiness at its highest! May the Spirit of God help us!

   If we wish to feel we are among the Lord's host, let us participate in
   their service. There is something for you and for me to do--and to
   enjoy this holiday we must all take a share in its engagements. Come,
   Brother, quicken your pace! You are not making enough progress in the
   Divine life--hasten your steps, throw away every weight--and cast off
   the garment which entangles your feet. You, too, dear Brother, over
   there in the workshop, where you hear bad language and see bad
   practices--go in for the wrestling--see what you can do! In the name of
   the Lord grasp the evil which opposes you! Fling an evil custom on its
   back and win a victory for purity and truth! Thus shall we each, by
   vying with the rest, contribute to the grand result and share in the
   general triumph!

   And when we are participating in the service, let us, next, feel that
   we can possess the inheritance! It is "the assembly of the
   first-born"--let no man miss his birthright! See how the Apostle
   introduces Esau as a warning and how he bids us regard our afflictions
   as chastisements which prove our sonship? Come, then, act as sons and
   rejoice in your Father's riches which are all your own! Let us not
   remain half-starved through the penury of our unbelief, but let us be
   filled to the brim through the richness of the faith which the Spirit
   of God has worked in us! Let us look on all things round about us with
   quite a different eye--not walking like slaves who dread their
   taskmaster and scarcely dare to call their breath their own--but like
   free men who have the Judge of all upon their side and can have nothing
   to fear in life or death! Deep be our reverence, but high our joy as we
   stand in His gracious Presence and, with all the blood-bought, rejoice
   with joy unspeakable and full of glory!

   At this moment our question is, "Lord, what will You have me to do?"
   Our cry is--"Here am I! Send me." Use me, my Lord, glorify Yourself in
   me! And while the innumerable company of angels look on, help me to do,
   dare, wrestle and win till You shall give to me, also, the crown of
   life that fades not away! This will not be a payment of debt, but a
   gift of Grace. The metaphor of a Greek assembly excludes all notion of
   wages for work. No mercenary thought entered the mind of a single Greek
   who strove for the mastery at the assembly. He had nothing to win but a
   crown of olive leaves! No money was ever given--it would have degraded
   the festival to a common show!

   Therefore you are not invited to contend that you may win a reward by
   your own merit. Ours is holiday work which it is joy to perform. Moved
   by a spiritual chivalry, saints do and dare for Jesus out of love for
   Him. His service is its own reward! To die for Him is life! To live for
   Him is Heaven! Let others boast their pedigree and nationality--we have
   reached the august convocation of the ransomed of the Lord who have
   come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads!

Chariots of Iron

   (No. 1690)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 28, 1882,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the Lord was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the
   mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
   because they had chariots of iron. And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as
   Moses said: and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak." Judges
   1:19,20.

   WE frequently use Canaan as a type of Heaven, and the Jordan, through
   which Israel passed, as a symbol of death. Dr. Watts has taught us to
   sing--

   "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood

   Stand dressed in living green;

   So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.

   Could we but climb where Moses stood,

   And view the landscape o'er,

   Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,

   Should fright us from the shore!" This is thoroughly poetical and may
   be made exceedingly instructive, but it is not quite accurate if we
   undertake a careful consideration of the whole matter. If the New
   Testament is to expound the Old, then there is another lesson to be
   learned from the land which flowed with milk and honey. "We that have
   believed do enter into rest," that is to say, all believers in Christ
   have crossed the Jordan and have come into the promised rest. The
   Covenant is already fulfilled to them in a great measure--they are
   living under Messiah's sway within the bounds of His Kingdom--and every
   precious thing which God promised them is theirs.

   They dwell in the "land which the Lord thinks upon." "Your land, O
   Immanuel!" The type, therefore, may best set forth the case of the
   instructed and advanced Believer who has passed through the first, or
   wilderness stage, of his life, and has now come into a higher
   condition, actually enjoying spiritual privileges and sitting together
   with Christ in the heavenly places. To him, however, this condition of
   exalted privilege is not a state of undisturbed repose--on the
   contrary, he wars a constant warfare, wrestling with spiritual
   wickedness. The Canaanite is in possession and the Canaanite is to be
   driven out. Our natural tendencies and corruptions; our sinful habits
   and lusts; the warping and bending of our spirit towards evil--all this
   has to be overcome--and we shall not possess the land so as to enjoy
   undivided tranquility until sin is utterly exterminated.

   What Joshua could not do, our Lord Jesus shall fully accomplish--the
   enemy within shall be rooted out and then shall dawn the day of our joy
   and peace--when we shall sit, every man, under his own vine and fig
   tree, and none shall make us afraid. That perfect victory shall be
   ours, but not yet. Taking this as the Truth of God, which we shall
   illustrate by our text, we notice that the work of Israel was to drive
   out and to utterly exterminate those condemned races which were in
   possession of Canaan. One tribe was chosen to lead the van in the
   fierce campaign. Joshua, their heroic leader, was gone--who should lead
   the way? The power of the Canaanites, in his day, had been broken, but
   now that he was dead, the old races began to build up, again, even as
   we oftentimes find our sins, which we thought were all dead, suddenly
   finding fresh courage and attempting to set up their empire once more.

   Then Israel went to God and enquired, "Who shall go up for us against
   the Canaanites first, to fight against them? And the Lord said, Judah
   shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hands." The
   tribe of Judah, then, was commissioned to lead the way and we see three
   things in its conduct of the enterprise. First, the Lord's power was
   trusted and magnified, for "the Lord was with Judah, and Judah drove
   out the inhabitants of the mountain." Secondly, by this

   very tribe, this right royal tribe, the Lord's power was not trusted
   and, therefore, restrained, for, "Judah could not drive out the
   inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."

   Yet, as if to rebuke them, they had a singular incident set before them
   for the vindication of God's power and, of that, we read in the 20th
   verse. Caleb, that grand old man who still lived on--the sole survivor
   of all who came out of Egypt--had obtained Hebron as his portion and he
   went up, in his old age, when his bones were sore and set, and slew the
   three sons of Anak, even three mighty giants, and took possession of
   their city. In this way the Lord's power was trusted and vindicated
   from the slur which Judah had brought upon it!

   I. Let us think upon our first head, which is, that by the tribe of
   Judah THE LORD'S POWER WAS TRUSTED AND MAGNIFIED. "The Lord was with
   Judah." Oh that the Holy Spirit may be with us! The people had wisely
   consulted their God and it fell to Judah's lot, by Divine appointment,
   to lead the van. In that work the tribe prospered. Read the chapter
   when you are at home and you will observe a series of great victories.
   "Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the
   Perizzites into their hands: and they slew of them in Bezek ten
   thousand men. And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought
   against him and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. But
   Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut
   off his thumbs and his great toes. And Adonibezek said, Threescore and
   ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered
   their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me."
   Thus they overcame the monarch who had domineered over the land and had
   been a terror to all the little kings.

   Next, the tribe attacked Jerusalem, Hebron, Debir and Hormah. Soon
   afterwards they fell upon the Philistines, who were men of war, and
   they took Gaza, Askelon and Ekron with their coasts. The Lord God, in
   this way, had proved to Judah and to all Israel what He could do. It
   would have been wise, on their part, to have put unlimited trust in
   Him-- then had they gone forward conquering and to conquer. Has not the
   Lord done the same with those of us who have believed in Him? What has
   your experience been, my Brothers and Sisters? I speak not to men of
   the world, nor to those who have just begun the Divine life, but I
   speak to those of you who have experience of the things of God and who
   have lived the life of faith for years.

   Has not God revealed His power in you? Do you not possess Infallible
   proofs of it which you would scarcely like to tell, for they are as
   secret as they are sacred? Though you would never mention them in a
   mixed audience, lest you should cast your pearls where they would not
   be appreciated, yet they are laid up in your memories in the form of
   remarkable deliverances, special comforts and singular mercies for
   which, to this day, you cannot account upon any other theory than that
   the Lord God Omnipotent put forth His hands and especially helped you
   in your hour of need! Do not forget these things. If the Lord's power
   is proved to your own soul by God, Himself, then it is proved, indeed!
   I care very little for those evidences of the existence of a God which
   are fashioned for us by learned men--the priority argument, the
   argument from analogy and all the rest.

   I have seen an end to them in my own doubts and fears. The most
   convincing evidence is found in another kind of reasoning, such as that
   which conquers all doubt by actual experience. When God has come to our
   soul and drawn near to us in the hour of our distress, we have needed
   no further argument! When He has said, "Peace," to our troubled spirit
   and stilled its raging, then have we received conclusive evidence of
   His power! When He has lifted us up into ecstasy and filled us with
   unspeakable joy and full of glory, we have laid up these evidences in
   our minds and our assurance has grown doubly sure! If we have not tied
   a bit of red tape round these briefs and hidden them away in our
   pigeonholes, we have taken better care of them than that--for we have
   locked them up in the inner chambers of our heart!

   Mary pondered these things in her heart and we have done the same.
   God's goodness was thus proved to Judah, even as it has been to many of
   us in our degree--proven as clearly as if it had been worked out
   mathematically, like a problem in Euclid. But the Lord had also proved
   His power to Judah in numerous victories. The victories which He gave
   to them were singular and remarkable, even when not miraculous, and
   there were many of them. They had gone from city to city and smitten
   all their foes. It seemed as if God had said to Judah, as He said to
   Joshua, "No man shall be able to stand against you all the days of your
   life."

   Now, repeated facts go to strengthen the inference drawn from former
   facts. According to the best practical philosophy, which is the
   inductive, you note a fact and then the inference from it is probable.
   You note another fact and the inference is more probable. You get six,
   seven, eight, 10, 20 similar facts and your deduction becomes more and
   more

   nearly certain. But when these facts come thick as hailstones--when
   they become as many as the drops of dew or the beams of light--then the
   inference may be regarded as absolutely sure! When your life is crowded
   with displays of God's power with you, for you and in you, then that
   power cannot be doubted! It is impossible to argue a Christian out of
   the grounds of his faith when he has had long dealings with God!

   There! You cavilers may boast that you can disprove a doctrine, if you
   like. I care nothing for your sophisms. You cannot disprove it to me.
   You can carp against the Old Testament or the New, if you like. I am
   sorry for you, for it is all clear enough to me, but I am not going to
   get into a great heat over it in order to combat you. It is not so very
   important what you prove, or do not prove, about the Book because the
   matter of fact still remains untouched. Those of us who have lived in
   the light of God's Countenance and have spoken with Him as a man speaks
   with his friend, and have had replies from Him, not once, nor twice,
   nor in years gone by, alone, but daily and continually--we, I say, are
   not to be moved from our belief!

   We have another life into which a stranger can not intrude and a
   conversation with God which seems ridiculous only to those who never
   knew it, for it is sublime as sublimity, itself, to those who enjoy it
   every day! And, having such a life, it furnishes us with evidence which
   does not go to be debated--we believe and are sure. Disprove our sanity
   and you have done something. Only let me tell you that even then we
   shall remain sane enough to hold to what we do hold and shall not be so
   mad as to join the infidel ranks! We are satisfied to be fools if to be
   fools means to see God! We are satisfied to know nothing about the
   "culture" and the "thought" of this grand century, if that involves
   being far off from the Eternal Lord and ceasing to see His hand in
   Nature, in Providence and in Grace! We are content if we may but know
   Him, whom to know is eternal life!

   Beloved Brothers and Sisters, I may say of many here present that God
   has proven His power and goodness to you by such overwhelming proofs
   that doubt, in your case, would be a grievous piece of folly and sin!
   God had especially favored Judah with remarkable assistance in what I
   may call, "brotherly action." "Judah said unto Simeon, his brother,
   Come up with me into my lot, that we may light against the Canaanites;
   and I, likewise, will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with
   Him." (See verse 8). In communion with each other, these tribes had
   further proof of God's power, for He gave them the necks of their
   enemies. We, also, can narrate wonderful displays of God's power and
   Grace when we have had fellowship, one with another, in holy service!
   Our choicest experiences have been enjoyed in Christian society. When
   the disciples were met together, the doors being shut, then Jesus came
   into the midst of them and said unto them, "Peace be unto you."

   The Lord is gracious to us when we are having sympathy with His poor
   and struggling people and entering into a mutual covenant that we will
   stand by each other and help each other in the midst of on ungodly
   world. The Lord is pleased with brotherly love and there He commands
   the blessing to rest as the dews on Herman! If I could forget the major
   part of my own personal experience at home, yet I can never forget the
   heavenly seasons spent in the Tabernacle with my beloved ones! In the
   Prayer Meetings, have not our hearts burned within us? At the
   banqueting table of celestial love--at the Lord's Supper--to which we
   delight to come every Lord's-Day, have we not attained a nether Heaven?
   Have we not passed into the vestibule of God's own house in Glory and
   felt that it needed scarcely the rending of the thinnest piece of
   tissue to let us actually stand in the unveiled Presence of God?

   Yes, God has been with us and we have had proofs enough of His power
   and love! When together, we have gone forth to battle to struggle
   against the sin of the age, to bear testimony for neglected Truths of
   God, to bring our wandering Brothers back, or to reclaim fallen Sisters
   to the faith of Jesus. Have we not obtained, in that fraternal action,
   grand proofs of the Master's power to bless and save? I know that we
   have! There let it stand and let it witness against us if we, in the
   future, yield to unbelief!

   Yet further, Brothers and Sisters, it so happened that to Judah, God
   gave great proofs of His Presence and power by raising up, here and
   there, a man in their midst who performed heroic deeds. I will not
   speak of Caleb, for you will tell me, "Ah, he was an old, old man and
   belonged to another generation! He was just going off the scene; we do
   not wonder that he did great things." Yes, but he had a nephew, one
   Othniel, a young man as yet unmarried. And when Caleb said, "He that
   smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah, my
   daughter, to wife," His nephew Othniel was the man for the city and the
   bride! The young hero stood forward, went up to the fortress and took
   the city. And he presented it into his uncle's hands and received the
   promised reward.

   Oh, yes, and we have seen raised up--and shall see it more and
   more--young heroes who have been self-denying, self-distrustful,
   inconsiderate of themselves who have been willing, for Christ's sake,
   to be anything or nothing, and God has been with them and the power of
   the Most High has rested upon them. Has not unbelief been rebuked when
   we have been compelled to say, "Instead of the fathers shall be the
   children, whom You may make princes in all the earth"? This has been a
   blessed token of God's Presence and power. I know how it is with those
   who have been long in the Church-- they wonder what is to become of it
   when the old folks die. "When the pastor is gone, what shall we do,
   then?" Wait till it happens, Brothers and Sisters! Wait till it happens
   and then you shall see that He who could find one servant, can find
   another!

   The Lord was never short of instruments, yet, and He never will be! You
   and I, you know, if we wear out one tool, must wait till we send to the
   shop for a second. But the Lord grows new tools out of old ones. New
   springs are born out of the decays of the old year's autumn. I have
   seen a young tree growing out of the roots of the old one and fresh
   leaves unfold where those of last year had once been. In our advancing
   years we become better recruiting sergeants and so enlist our own
   successors. You who are now getting gray, once wondered what would
   become of the cause of God when the guide of your youth fell asleep in
   Jesus--but the immortal cause has survived the death of the
   standard-bearer! We never hear of that good man, now! Indeed, he does
   not seem to have been so important as you thought. God will find
   messengers as long as He has errands.

   When certain of us have gone Home, you young people will be leading in
   our place, and you will say, "I remember the old gentleman. We valued
   his ministry and we could not think what we should do without him. But
   we have done a deal better without him than ever we did with him, for
   God, in His infinite mercy, has raised up a worthy successor."
   Therefore be of good courage and let what you have seen as to the past
   be to you a prophecy of God's goodness in the future! Caleb shall be
   gathered to his fathers, but Othniel shall follow him, who shall be as
   brave as he. The reason why the men of Judah were successful was
   because they had full confidence in God. Up to a certain point Judah
   relied upon God. Jehovah had bid them to lead the way, and they led the
   way. He had conducted them from city to city--and they went, not
   doubting that God would be with them--and so success attended them, for
   they leaned upon the Lord.

   Thus shall it be with us, for it is written, "According to your faith
   be it unto you." The Lord will not fall short of the measure--let us
   not make the measure short. Yet this is where we too frequently fail,
   for our faith is such a poor piece of business. We scarcely trust God
   as well as we trust a generous man! And when God does a great thing for
   His people, they say, one to another, "Is it not surprising? Is it not
   wonderful?" Many are amazed that God should keep His word! And so, when
   He answers prayer, they exclaim, "What a marvelous thing!" Is it, then,
   a marvel for God to be true? For God to keep His promise? I grant you
   that there is a side of it which forever must be marvelous, but I still
   fear that with the allowable marvel, there is often mixed such a degree
   of unbelief that the wonderment is not so much of admiring gratitude as
   astonished unbelief!

   For God to hear prayer is as natural as for a cause to produce an
   effect! There is as much, and as certain, and as Infallible a
   connection between prayer that is worked in us by the Holy Spirit and
   the result of that prayer as there is between force in the steam engine
   and the motion of the train! Instead of the power of prayer being a
   mere fiction, it is the most practical and certain of all the forces
   that are in existence this side of the Eternal Throne. God works more
   by prayer than by anything else and if we would but enlarge the channel
   through which His mighty power would flow--by having more faith and
   more confidence in prayer--we should see greater things than these!

   II. Now I come to the painful but important subject of THE LORD'S POWER
   RESTRAINED BECAUSE DISTRUSTED. The men of Judah could drive out the
   inhabitants of the mountain, but they could not drive out the
   inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron. Some of
   our more flippant infidels have asserted that this verse says that the
   Lord could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, yet the
   antecedent is not God at all, but Judah. It is Judah that could not
   drive them out. "Well," they say, "but God was with Judah and they did
   drive out the people of the mountain. Why could they not drive out the
   people of the plain by the same power?"

   This is the hinge of the matter. They did not conquer the men of the
   iron chariots because God, in that business, was not with them. As far
   as their faith went, God kept touch with them and they could do
   anything and everything. But when they despondingly thought that they
   could not drive out the inhabitants of the wide valleys, then they
   failed utterly! They were afraid because of the chariots, which had
   poles between the horses armed with lances which cut their way

   through the crowd. And the axles of the wheels were fitted with great
   scythes--these inventions were novel and caused a panic and, therefore,
   the men of Judah lost their faith in God--and so became weak and
   cowardly. They said, "It is of no use; we cannot meet these terrible
   machines," and, therefore they did not pray or make an attempt to meet
   the foe.

   They could not drive out the people. Of course they could not! If they
   had exhibited the same faith about the chariots of iron as about the
   men of the hills, the chariots of iron would have been no better than
   chariots of straw, for the Lord "breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in
   sunder, and burns the chariot in the fire." If they had believed in God
   and gone forth in His name, the horses would soon have fled, as,
   indeed, they did when God gave His people faith!

   When Barak led the way with Deborah, then they smote Jabin who had 900
   chariots of iron! They fled. They fled away, for the Lord was with
   Barak and gave them up to him as chaff to the whirlwind! God would have
   been with Judah if Judah had displayed faith, but, having no faith,
   they could not rout the chariots of iron. Their faith was imperfect.
   They retained too much confidence in themselves. Mark that, for if
   their confidence had been in God, alone, these chariots of iron would
   have been ciphers in the calculation! If God has to give the victory,
   then chariots of iron or chariots of fire are no item at all against an
   Omnipotent God.

   They evidently thought that there were something, for their power went
   as far as smiting the men of the hills, but not so far as attacking the
   cavalry in the open plain where there was room for them to rush to and
   fro! Now, that is also your weakness and mine! We tacitly imply that
   God can help us up to a certain point. Does not that mean that we can
   help ourselves after that point? Being interpreted, the belief conceals
   a measure of self-trust and the next akin to self-trust is distrust. If
   you have passed out of yourself, where have you entered? Into the
   infinite! The man who has reached the infinite needs not to reckon any
   longer. It was of no use for Noah to keep a log of his vessel when
   there remained no more land--when it was all sea, it did not matter to
   him where he drifted! And so when you once get right away from self
   there are no limits.

   God is unbounded--therefore trust Him without stint! Act like Samson,
   the strong, because the childlike, hero. If there is a Philistine to
   meet, he is ready for him. There are two of them--he is quite ready for
   both! There are 20 of them--it makes no difference! A thousand of them
   are before him! All right, there are only the more for the hero to
   kill, for he will slay every mother's son of them and pile up their
   carcasses, heaps upon heaps! Numbers do not matter. "But, Samson, if
   you are to do this deed, you must wield a good Damascus blade." "Yes,"
   he says, "if I am to do it, of course I must! But if the Lord is to do
   it, the jawbone of an ass will suffice." It made no difference to him,
   when he had thrown himself simply and nakedly upon God, whether foes
   were few or many, whether weapons were fit or feeble!

   Herein is the failure of our faith if it rests not in God's bare arm.
   See this round world, how steadily it turns! How smoothly it moves
   along in its predestinated course! Why? Because God has hung it upon
   nothing and God's own will directs it. Suppose it were hung on a
   chain--would it be any the more secure? The strength of the chain would
   come from God, so it is better to have the power without the chain.
   Though a saint is sustained by nothing but the power of God, all the
   devils in Hell cannot stir him. The bare arm of God is the source of
   all power.

   Next, the imperfection of their faith lay in this, as it may do in
   yours, my Brothers and Sisters--that they believed one promise of God
   and did not believe another. There is a kind of faith which is strong
   in one direction, but utter weakness if tried in other ways. It is
   curious that persons generally speak out the easiest promises to
   believe, while those which are greater and, therefore, are the more
   godlike, they cannot believe! Judah believed in smiting the men of the
   hills because he thought such warfare easy. But as to overcoming the
   cavalry with their chariots of iron, that was difficult, and so he did
   not believe up to that mark. Beware of being pickers and choosers of
   God's promises! You who are traders know that customers will turn all
   your stock over and keep on picking over packet after packet and never
   buy anything at the end.

   Does this please you? When people pick the promises over they
   say--"That one? No, I cannot receive that." When they do believe a
   promise, it is the smallest in the Bible! Oh, for a faith that takes
   the promises in the bulk and knows nothing of choosing or refusing!
   Whatever God has promised, He is able, also, to perform! And if the
   promise is but suitable to my case, I am to grasp it and expect to see
   it fulfilled! Some believe God at one time and not at another. Do you
   not find that you believe the Lord a good deal on Thursday nights after
   a sermon? How about Friday nights? Ah, that is rather different, isn't
   it?

   I have known friends who are wonderful Believers on Sunday. They go
   home singing--

   "Let the earth's old pillars shake And all the wheels of Nature break!
   Our steady souls shall fear no more Than solid rocks when billows
   roar."

   You make a bad debt on Monday--how do you feel about it? Not quite so
   much like a pillar, I daresay, but rather more like the thistledown
   that is blown with the wind! Such faith is temporary. It is not unlike
   the faith mentioned in Aesop's fable when the stag stood looking into
   the water at his branching antlers and, tossing his head with defiance,
   said, "Why am I afraid of the hounds? A dog come near me? Impossible!
   If the hound does but see my horns he will fear death! I shall rip him
   up or dash him to pieces. I will let the pack see what I am made of."
   Just then there was heard a bark and away went the stag like lightning,
   as terrified as ever!

   How like us! We appear to be so grandly strong, so quietly
   believing--yet the first trouble that comes, scatters our courage! That
   is the reason why Judah could not drive out the dwellers in the
   plain--he heard the rushing of those chariots of iron and his heart
   failed him. There was a further reason for failure arising out of this
   imperfection of their faith-- they could not conquer the chariots of
   iron because, first, they did not try. The Hebrew does not say that
   they could not drive them out. What the Hebrew says is that they did
   not drive them out. Some things we cannot do because we never make the
   attempt.

   I wish we had among Christian workers the spirit of the Suffolk lad who
   was brought up in court to be examined by an overbearing lawyer. The
   lawyer roughly said to him, "Hodge, can you read Greek?" "I don't know,
   Sir," he said. "Well, fetch a Greek book," said the lawyer and, showing
   the lad a passage, he said to him, "Can you read that?" "No." "Then why
   did you not say that you could not?" "Because I never say I cannot do a
   thing till I have tried it." If that spirit were in Christian people,
   we should achieve great things--but we set down such-and-such a thing
   as manifestly beyond our power and, silently, we whisper to ourselves,
   "therefore beyond God's power," and so we leave it alone. No chariots
   of iron will be driven out if we dare not make the attempt!

   Next, I suspect that they did not drive them out because they were
   idle. If cavalry were to be dealt with, Judah must bestir himself. If
   chariots of iron were to be defeated, they must enter upon an arduous
   campaign and so, taking counsel of their fears and their idleness, they
   said, "Let us not venture on the conflict." There are many things that
   Christ's Church is unable to do because it is too lazy. "What?" you
   ask, "Do you call us lazy?" No, Brothers and Sisters, I will not do
   anything of the sort! If any of you should happen to call yourselves,
   lazy, it will spare me the trouble. I am afraid that I should have to
   upbraid certain ministers for being indolent in God's work and I fear
   that many others of God's servants are none too diligent. Idleness
   refuses to sound the trumpet for the battle and the fight never comes
   on--and therefore the enemy is not driven out.

   Then, again, they were not at all anxious to meet the men who manned
   those chariots, for they were afraid. These men of Judah were cowards
   in the presence of chariots of iron and what can a coward do? He is
   great at running away! They say that he, "may live to fight another
   day." Not he--he will live, but he will not live to fight, depend upon
   it--no more another day than he does today! His heart is in his heels
   and he will show his foeman his back whenever the fight is hot. We must
   cry mightily to God to deliver us from cowardice--and then we shall
   accomplish what we now think impossible!

   Dear Friends, there was no excuse for this on the part of Judah, as
   there is really no excuse for us when we think any part of God's work
   to be too difficult for us--for, remember, there was a special promise
   made about this very case. Kindly look at the 20th chapter of the Book
   of Deuteronomy, at the first verse, and you will see how the Lord says,
   "When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses, and
   chariots, be not afraid of them: for the Lord your God is with you." If
   there is a special promise made to meet an emergency, who are we that
   we should be cast down by the difficulty? Besides that, they received a
   special commission. Read the second verse of the chapter from which our
   text is taken--"The Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have
   delivered the land into his hands." Iron chariots or no chariots, God
   had delivered the country into Judah's hands!

   Besides that, their God had done greater deeds than this! He had
   divided the Red Sea and drowned the army of Egypt! He had divided the
   Jordan into halves and led His people through the river dry shod--and
   He had made the walls of Jericho to fall flat to the ground! Why, then,
   was He distrusted because of those wretched chariots of iron? Come,
   then, Brothers and Sisters, have you got into a tight fit in the matter
   of your personal affairs? And are you saying, to-

   night, "I cannot pray about it. I cannot trust God about it"? Is that
   right? Look your Bibles up and see whether there is not a promise
   exactly suited to your singular condition! Look back upon your own
   experience and see whether God has not already done for you and others
   of His people a greater thing than your present trial requires!

   Why will you say that you cannot drive out the chariots of iron? Be of
   good courage and go forward! God is able to deliver you, therefore fear
   not! He will supply your needs--be not dismayed. Perhaps some holy work
   for God is your difficulty. You have done something, already, for which
   you praise God, but now a new work is laid at your door, of which you
   say, "No, I cannot undertake it. I do not feel at all equal to it."
   What if the Almighty Lord has said, "I will be with you"? Do you
   answer, "I could do almost anything, but not that"? Are you sure, my
   Brother, that you could do almost anything? Do you not think that, if
   another task were set before you, it would be equally hard for you? If
   God commands, is it right to reason why, or even to ask a question? Let
   us get at the work, my Brothers and Sisters--and the greater the
   danger, the greater the labor, the greater the difficulty--so much the
   more fully let us cast ourselves upon our God and give to Him the Glory
   of the deed when the work is done!

   You know not what you can do! You are Omnipotent if girt about with
   God's Omnipotence! You are wise if God teaches you, strong if God
   upholds you! The capacities which are within a man are greater than he
   knows and the capacities with which God can endow a man are greater
   than he can dream! Therefore, forward in the name of the Most High! An
   unconverted person is here who has been thinking of coming to Christ,
   but he says, "I cannot give up all my sins. One of them I must
   retain--all the rest I can leave, but that one is invincible--for it
   has chariots of iron. I cannot drive it out," That sin must die, or you
   will perish by it! Depend upon it, that sin which you would save from
   slaughter will slaughter you! "But I am in such a strange connection
   and there are so many peculiar circumstances about my case."

   Yes, 1 know. Peculiar circumstances surround all men that go to Hell,
   but they do not quench the fire for them! "But, Sir, we must live."
   Must you? I see no necessity for that in my own case. I know that I
   must serve God, but whether I live or not is a secondary matter! It is
   infinitely better that we should die than do wrong. This necessity of
   living is not quite so clear as people suppose. Why must you live? The
   martyrs did not. They felt that they must testify for Christ and His
   Truth--and they gloried to die, rather than to do anything that was
   wrong! You will not, perhaps, be brought to that, but you ought to be
   ready for it. Do not be in such a fever about this poor life. Is not
   the soul better than the body?

   "Yes, Sir, but I cannot explain my difficulty." No, and do not try!
   Turn the sin out. That is the only thing to do with it and the more you
   love it, the more speedily should you turn it out, for it evidently
   lies near your heart where it can do you great mischief. "Well, it is
   not one of the grosser sins." No, it is one of those respectable sins
   which are so hard to get rid of! You must drive it out! I notice that
   if anybody picks my pocket it is sure to be a respectable-looking
   person. If a man is a rogue, he is sure to look like an honest man, to
   lead people to trust him. Sin must be driven out, even though it is a
   chariot of iron.

   Certain Christians make up their minds that certain sins must be
   tolerated in their cases. I know one who has constitutionally a fiery
   temper and so, whenever he gets into a towering passion, he cries, "I
   cannot help it! I am so constituted." Instead of weeping before God and
   vowing, "I will master this passion! God is Omnipotent and He can make
   my temper a reasonable one"--instead of that--he says that everything
   else can be conquered in him, but not this sin, for it is
   constitutional. So have I also known persons to be miserly and mean.
   The Grace of God has done everything for them except make them give
   away a shilling--and they suppose that they are to go to Heaven with
   their covetous nature, as if the Lord would let such people in there!
   Selfishness is put down by them as being one of the sins that have
   chariots of iron which they cannot overcome.

   "You know that we all have our besetments," says one. What do you mean
   by that? Some sin that you often fall into? Do you call that a
   besetting sin? If I were to walk, tonight, across Clapham Common and
   half-a-dozen men stopped me, I should say that I was beset. But, if at
   an appointed place, a party met me regularly, I should not say that I
   was beset! And so, the same which a man often indulges in is not his
   besetting sin--it is his favorite sin--a sin that will be his ruin! A
   besetting sin is one which forces itself upon a man--and if he is on
   his guard--it seizes him by the throat and throws him down. We must be
   watchful, so that the next time the temptation comes we may escape from
   it. Let us make war on the evil and say, "It is no use your attacking
   me--I will attack and overcome you by faith in Jesus Christ."

   The fact is, Brothers and Sisters, we must tolerate no sin in
   ourselves! If we make excuses for it in our Brethren, well and good,
   but let us never make or accept an excuse for ourselves. Sin in us is
   10 times worse sin than in others. If an un-

   converted man sins, it is bad enough, but when a man has tasted of the
   good Word of Grace and has leaned his head on Christ's bosom and then
   falls into sin, what excuse can be offered for him? None! Let us weep
   tears of blood because we thus offend. We will yet vanquish the
   chariots of iron! We will throw down the gauntlet tonight and in the
   name of God we will destroy them!

   III. To close. Let us see THE LORD'S POWER VINDICATED. Just at that
   time, brave old Caleb, leaning on his cane, went up to Hebron. When he
   was a younger man, Moses sent him as a spy. And when he was on that
   business, he happened to come near Hebron and there he saw three
   tremendous fellows of the race of the giants. I suppose they were from
   eight to 10 or 12 feet high. He saw them and those that were with him
   were afraid. They said, "We were as grasshoppers in their sight." But
   Caleb was not a bit afraid! He said, "God is not with them and they
   will be easily overthrown."

   When they came into the land 40 years later, Caleb did not ask for his
   city. But as an unselfish man, he fought to win cities for others. When
   that was done, he said, "Hebron was given to me. I must go and conquer
   it. And the giants that I saw years ago, I dare say, have not grown
   much shorter, so I must cut them down." Away he went and it proved as
   he had said--in his frail old age, he was able to slay those three sons
   of Anak--and to take possession of their city. I could tell you of holy
   women, sick and infirm, scarcely able to leave their beds, who are
   doing work which, to some strong Christians, seems too hard to attempt!
   Have I not seen old men doing for the Lord in their feebleness that
   which young men have declined? Could I not tell you of some with only
   one talent--certainly no more--who are bringing in a splendid revenue
   of Glory to their Lord and Master, while you fine young fellows with 10
   talents have wrapped them all in a napkin and hid them in the earth?

   I wish that I could shame myself, and shame every worker here into
   enterprises that would astonish unbelievers! God help us to do that
   which seems impossible! Let men be provoked to charge us with
   fanaticism! God bless the fanaticism which, being translated, means
   nothing but a true faith in the living God! May we be helped to trust
   the Lord as He ought to be trusted and march on till we drive out all
   His enemies despite their chariots of iron, that unto God may be Glory
   forever and ever! Amen.

Christ's Word with You

   (No. 1691)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING JUNE 12 1881,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE NEWINGTON.

   "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest." Matthew 11:28.

   WHEN THE REGULAR CONGREGATION LEFT THEIR SEATS TO BE OCCUPIED BY
   STRANGERS.

   ONE is struck with the personality of this text. There are two persons
   in it, "you" and "Me"--that is to say, the laboring one and the tender
   Savior who entreats him to come, that he may find rest. It is most
   important, if we wish to see the way of peace, clearly, to understand
   that we must, each one, come personally to Jesus for rest--"Come unto
   Me, all you that labor"--and that coming, on our part, must be to a
   personal Christ. In effect He says, "Come, yourselves, to Me. Come not
   through sponsors, not through men whom you choose to call your priests,
   not through the petitions of ministers and teachers, but come,
   yourselves, for yourselves."

   Dear Hearers, the quarrel is between you and God, and this quarrel can
   only be made up by your approaching the Lord through a Mediator--it
   would be folly for you to ask another to come to the Mediator for
   you--you must trust in Him, yourself. Personal faith is indispensable
   to salvation. But the personality of Christ is equally brought out in
   our text. Jesus says, "Come unto Me"--"not to anybody else, but to Me."
   He does not say, "Come to hear a sermon about Me," but, "come to Me."
   He does not say, "Come to sacraments which shall teach you something
   about Me," but, "come to Me"--to My work and Person.

   You will observe that no one is put between you and Christ. The text
   is, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden"--not to
   somebody that will stand between you and Me, but, "Come to Me at once,
   and without a go-between." Come to Jesus directly, even to Jesus,
   Himself. You do need a Mediator between yourselves and God, but you do
   not need a mediator between yourselves and Jesus! Christ Jesus is the
   Mediator between you and the Father--you need no one to stand between
   you and Christ. To Him we may look at once, with unveiled face, guilty
   as we are! To Him we may come, just as we are, without anyone to
   recommend us, or plead for us, or make a bridge for us to Jesus. We are
   to come only to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, whom God has
   ordained to be the way of access.

   I shall fail at this in setting forth the Gospel if I shall lead
   anybody to think that he can get salvation by going to a church, or
   going to a meeting house, or going to a minister, or going into an
   inquiry-room, or going to a penitent form. No, we are to go nowhere but
   to Jesus. YOU, just as you are, are to come to Christ as He is--and the
   promise is that on your coming to Him, He will give you rest. That is
   the assurance of Jesus, Himself, and there is no deception in it. He
   will give you rest us surely as you come to Him. What a blessing it
   will be if those who have no rest in themselves should find rest at
   once in Jesus while yet this sermon calls them!

   Why not? I hope many of you, my Brothers and Sisters, who have found
   rest, already, will be praying while I am preaching, that the unresting
   ones may come at this good hour and find rest in Jesus Christ the
   Savior. You see there are two persons. Let everybody else vanish and
   let these two be left alone to transact heavenly business with each
   other. Jesus says to you, "Come to Me." Your answer to Him, if it is, "
   Yes, Lord, I come," shall be the means of bringing peace to your heart
   from this time forth and forevermore! I want, at this time, to set
   forth the Glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, who sends this pressing
   personal invitation to every laboring and heavy laden one in this
   place. I wish that I knew how to preach. I have tried to do so for 30
   years or so, but I am only now beginning to learn the art. Oh, that one
   knew how to set forth Christ so that men perceived His beauty and fell
   in love with Him at first sight!

   Oh, Spirit of God, make it so now! If men knew the grandeur of His
   Gospel--the joy, the peace, the happiness which comes of being a
   Christian, they would run to Him! As flies seek after sweet fruit, so
   would men seek after the Savior, if they did but know that sweeter than
   honey and the honeycomb is the word of His salvation!

   I. I first call your attention to THE VALUE OF THE GIFT which, in this
   text, is set before weary, laboring men-- "Come unto Me, all you that
   labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Rest of the heart
   is worth more than all California! To be at peace--to be no more tossed
   up and down in the soul--to be secure, peaceful, joyful, happy, is
   worth mountains of diamonds. A man's life consists not in the abundance
   of the things which he possesses--many a poor man is vastly happier
   than the possessor of large estates--for peace comes not with property,
   but with contentment. The music of peace is not the jingle of gold or
   silver.

   Sweeter bells sound in the pardoned heart than ever wealth can ring.
   The herb called heart's-ease often grows in tiny gardens and happy is
   the man who wears it in his bosom. It is this gift which, for value,
   outshines the pearls and rubies which deck an Indian queen, which Jesus
   promises to give to all that come to Him for it! Oh, rare peace which
   comes from the Prince of Peace! This, if a man gets it, is practically
   helpful to him in all the affairs of life. I say that other things
   being equal, there is nobody so fit to run the race of life as the man
   who is unloaded of his cares and enjoys peace of mind. The man who is
   happily restful towards God is the man to fight the battle of life! I
   have known a man losing money on the market to quietly step aside and,
   getting into a quiet place, breathe a prayer to God and come back calm
   and composed. And, whereas before, in his distraction, he was ready to
   make bad bargains, plunge into speculation and lose terribly, he has
   come back rested and peaceful, and has been in a fit frame for dealing
   with his fellow men.

   I know this, Brothers and Sisters, having many cares resting upon
   myself, that when I can feel calmly restful and quiet before God, I am
   a match for anybody! But when once the spirits sink and depression
   comes in, then the grasshopper becomes a burden, and a trifle frets the
   soul! Bring solid rest to the heart and you have given the man a
   fulcrum upon which he may rest the lever with which he can lift the
   heaviest weight. But let him always be tossed up and down and he has
   nothing to give him force. When a man is afraid to die, he may well be
   afraid to live--he who could not look death in the face--yes that could
   not look God in the face, is a man who has a latent weakness about him
   that will rob him of force and courage in the heat of the battle.

   I commend to you, Brothers and Sisters, in this busy London, the
   precious gift of my text called, "rest," because it is not only a
   preparation for the world to come but for the life that now is. The
   peace of God will serve both as arms and armor! It is both battle-axe
   and breastplate. It will be your heart's comfort and your hands'
   strength. It will be good for day and night, for calm and storm. It has
   a thousand uses and all of them are essential to spiritual well-being.
   This rest is not found anywhere else but in Christ. Let me tell you
   what kind of rest it is, confessing that I now enjoy it and revel in

   it.

   It is rest to the man's entire spiritual being. Conscience troubles us
   till Jesus speaks it into rest. Conscience looks back and cries,
   "Things are not right! You were wrong here, wrong there and wrong
   altogether! There is no rest for you." Conscience keeps a diary and
   writes with heavy pen a gloomy record which we read with alarm.
   "Tremble," says Conscience, "for you will see this record again at the
   Judgment Day and find yourself condemned by it to eat the fruits of
   your doings." Men laugh and say they do not believe it--but they do
   believe it. Deep in their hearts they must believe it, for God has a
   witness within which blurts out the truth. Conscience perpetually
   rouses some men, as a watchdog wakes a slumbering householder. "Down,
   Sir," they say, "Lie down, lie down," but this watchdog of God in the
   heart will not always lie down--every now and then it begins to howl
   horribly--and the man cannot sleep as he needs to sleep. Even if you
   drug Conscience, it will have fits of barking in its sleep.

   Now, Jesus promises, to those who come to Him, a peaceful conscience
   which He will give through pardoning all the past, through changing the
   current of the man's ideas in the present and through helping him to
   avoid, in the future, the faults into which he fell in the days that
   have now gone by--

   "Rest, weary soul,

   The penalty is borne, the ransom paid, For all your sins full
   satisfaction made. Strive not to do, yourself, what Christ has done!
   Claim the free gift and make the joy your own. No more by pangs of
   guilt and fear distress, Rest, sweetly rest!"

   It is a grand thing to have rest of conscience. But then we have
   minds--and minds are troublous things. In these days of doubt, it is
   not easy for a mind to get an anchorage and keep it. Many are searching
   for something to believe or, at least, they long to be quite sure that
   it would be the right thing not to believe. Minds are tossed about like
   ships at sea, or birds caught in a fierce gale.

   My mind was once in that state. It drifted and was carried along, I
   knew not where. I, for a while, believed nothing, till at last it came
   to this--that I thought my own existence might be, after all, a mere
   thought! Having a practical vein in my character, I sat down and
   laughed at my own dreams of non-existence for I felt that I did exist!
   Up from the depths of doubt and unbelief I rose to feel there must be
   something sure. I cast my soul at Jesus' feet and I rested--and I am,
   now, perfectly content in mind. Thousands of us can say, "We know whom
   we have believed and are persuaded that He is able to keep that which
   we have committed to Him" and, therefore, we cannot leave the Gospel of
   Jesus Christ!

   No new doctrines, no novelties, no skepticisms, no fresh information
   can now disturb us--at least they can but breathe a
   surface-ruffling--all is calm in the soul's deeps. Having found rest of
   intellect in the doctrine of Jesus, there will we stay till death and
   Heaven, or the Second Advent solves all riddles! But then we have
   hearts. I hope we all have hearts, though some are harsh and almost
   heartless. Men that have great, all-embracing hearts need a rest for
   their love. What a cause of trouble this heart of ours is, for it often
   clings to that which is unworthy of it and we are deceived and
   disappointed--and heart-break crushes us. The tempting fruit, like the
   apple of Sodom, crumbles into ashes in our hand.

   Here, then, is rest and remedy for heart palpitations and the anguish
   of the breast. Let a man love Jesus and he will crave no other love,
   for this will fill his soul to the brim!--

   "Him on yonder Cross I love; Nothing else on earth I count dear!"
   Christ fills a man's nature to the brim! The Incarnate Son of God, once
   known, gives rest of conscience, rest of intellect and rest of heart.
   In a word, He brings complete satisfaction to the spirit. Now, I do not
   know of any religion that offers perfect rest to the mind except the
   religion of Jesus Christ. Men go the world over to try and find this
   pearl of great price, but their quest is in vain. I often talk with
   religious people who have no idea of being saved, now, and finding rest
   at once because they do not understand that Christ came to give
   immediate salvation to those who trust Him.

   I spoke with one earnest soul a little while ago, and she said, "I have
   no rest." I replied, "Have you believed in Jesus Christ? " She
   answered, "Yes." "But," I asked, "Do you not know that as soon as you
   believe in Jesus Christ, your sins are forgiven you and you are saved?"
   "I did not grasp that," she said. Yet that is the Gospel--that whoever
   believes in Jesus is not condemned. He that believes in Him has
   everlasting life, and is saved the moment he believes--becomes changed
   from the power of sin and made into a new man--possessing a new life
   which can never die! This assurance is worth getting hold of and he
   that has it, let him hold it fast and rejoice in it! Yet it is not to
   be obtained anywhere except from the dear hands that were nailed to the
   Cross. This rest can never come from any lips but those that prayed
   upon the Cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

   This, then, is the gift which is presented by Christ Jesus at this
   moment to all that labor and are heavy laden. If they will come to Him
   for it, they shall have rest of soul. Some in this place are panting
   for rest. In this great city there must be much trouble, sorrow,
   unrest, misery and distraction. When I look on this congregation, I
   know that I could not bear to hear the tale of sorrow that would be
   unfolded if each man were to tell his inward anguish. We look cheerful,
   but many a cheerful face covers a sad heart. The weight of human misery
   is enough to make the axles of the earth to break! Oh, what a blessing
   it is that there is One who can lift us up--One who can make the
   poorest to be better than if he were rich, and the sad to be happier
   than the merry--and the afflicted to be more blest than the prosperous!

   Jesus is here in our midst with hands loaded with mercy. May He prove
   His Presence among us by giving rest to all those who came in here
   laboring and laden. Thus have I spoken upon the value of the gift. Oh,
   Spirit of God, teach men its value!

   II. Bear with me, in the second place, while I speak upon THE LARGENESS
   OF THE SAVIOR'S HEART. Oh, that I could stand aside and that He would
   come here, Himself, and utter the words of my text with His own dear
   lips! "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden." See the
   persons whom He invites to come to Him! None but a Man of great soul
   would keep such company! If we would be merry, we choose merry company.
   Some folks I should be glad to be in Heaven with, but I could dispense
   with their company here--for ten minutes with them on earth is enough
   to make

   one wretched! Only a generous spirit would say, "Come to Me, all you
   that are downcast--all you that are despond-ing--all you that are
   broken-hearted."

   Yet that is exactly what the text says! Christ courts the company of
   the sorrowful and invites those who are ill at ease to approach Him.
   What a heart of love He must have! No, He invites all such to come. You
   know two or three that are really cast down are quite enough at a time
   for most of us. It happened some months ago, when I was sitting here to
   see people, that I had four or five cases so sad--so deplorable--and
   which I could render such little help, that, after trying to pray with
   them and encourage them, I said to a friend who was helping me, "I hope
   the next that comes to me will be cheerful, for I feel my head ache and
   my heart, too!" I tried as best I could to enter into these poor
   people's troubles till I became troubled myself!

   The Savior has such a large heart that He does not forbid the sorrowing
   ones to come--none of them. "Come one," He says, "come all. All of you
   that labor and are heavy laden may at this hour come to Me." The love
   of my Master's heart is so great and the sympathy of His nature with
   man is so deep, that if all should come that ever labored or ever
   sorrowed, He would not be exhausted by the sympathy, but would still be
   able to give them rest in Himself! And what a large heart Jesus has,
   that He comes only to do men good and begins by doing good, first, to
   those that need it most. Oh, my Lords and Ladies, Jesus did not come to
   win your patronage that you might applaud Him! Oh, you frivolous and
   high-flying ones, Jesus did not come to win your approbation! It would
   be a small thing to Him for you to think well of

   Him!

   But, O you despised and rejected, you oppressed and down-trod--you
   weary, you worn, you sad, you sick, you desponding, you despairing--the
   Great Physician of souls comes after you and it is to you He addresses
   the invitation at this time--"Come unto Me, all you that labor and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Come, such as you are, and come
   all of you! And, He says, come at once! He does not say, "Stop till you
   get your spirits raised. Stop till you get some measure of relief," but
   come just as you are! There is a notion in some people's minds that
   they cannot believe in Christ till they are better. Christ does not
   need your betterness! Will you only go to the physician when you feel
   better? Then you are foolish, indeed, for you do not need the physician
   when you are getting better! The best time to apply to a physician is
   when you are as bad as you can be--and the time to come to Jesus is
   when you are so bad that you cannot be worse!

   You had better come just as you are--He invites you to do so. "Come,"
   He says, "all you that now labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest." Stay not to improve yourselves, but come to Him for
   improvement! If you cannot come with a broken heart, come for a broken
   heart! If you cannot come with faith, come for faith! If you cannot
   come repenting, come and ask the Lord to give you repentance! Come
   empty-handed, bankrupt, ruined, condemned and you will find rest! Oh,
   you that have written out your own sentence and have said, "I shall
   perish; there is no pardon for me"-- come to Jesus, for depths of
   mercy! There is pardon even for you! Only come to the Savior and He
   will give you rest! He promises this rest to all who come to Him. My
   Master stakes His credit upon every case that comes to Him. He has
   already given rest to thousands, no, to millions! And He promises to
   each one that comes to Him that He will give rest to him.

   If there is in this place; if there is in this country; if there is in
   this universe a single person who ever did come to Jesus Christ and He
   did not give him rest, I would like to know of it, because it is my
   daily habit to declare that Jesus gives rest to all that come to Him
   and I do not want to declare a lie! Let us know when Jesus fails. He
   says, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." The first one
   of you that comes and He casts you out, let us know of it! We will post
   it up on the Royal Exchange--"A sinner came to Jesus and He would not
   receive him." Woe to the world in that dark day, for the sun of hope
   will be quenched and the night will miss her stars. Till then, we beg
   you to remember that Jesus has said, "Him that comes to Me I will in no
   wise cast out." Come and test my blessed Lord and see if He does not
   accept you!

   We stake the veracity of Christ; we stake the Truth of the Gospel upon
   the case of everyone in this place who will come to Jesus Christ by
   faith and trust Him! Each heavy-laden one must and shall find rest if
   he will come to Jesus, or else the Redeemer's promise is not true.

   Thus have I spoken upon the largeness of our Lord's heart in promising
   rest to all that come to Him for it.

   III. But now, thirdly, and but a moment, let me speak to you about THE
   BLESSEDNESS OF HIS POWER. Our

   Lord Jesus Christ is able to give peace to all that labor and are heavy
   laden. He has not outrun His power in the promise

   that He has given. He is conscious that within Himself there resides a
   power which will be able to give peace to every conscience. Notice
   there is no reserve made, whatever--no way is left of backing out of
   the promise. "Come unto Me," He says, "all you that labor and are heavy
   laden, and I will give you rest." No limiting clause is inserted. Some
   men will speak what looks to be a very large promise, but a little
   condition inserted in it narrows it horribly. But there is no condition
   here.

   Whoever born of woman that labors and is heavy laden, and will come to
   Christ, must have rest. And Christ has said it because He can give it!
   There are desperate cases among the myriads of troubled hearts, but no
   single one is too far gone for Jesus. You have read the story of John
   Bunyan in, "Grace Abounding." Was there ever a poor wretch that was
   dragged about by the devil more than poor John was? For five years and
   more he could not call his soul his own. He did not dare to sleep
   because he was afraid he would wake up in Hell. All day long he was
   troubled. He fretted and worried with this and that, and the other.
   Poor tinker that he was, he first thought this, and then thought that!
   And, as he says, he was "considerably tumbled up and down in his mind."
   I am sure such a case as that would have been given up by men--but when
   Jesus took it in hand, John Bunyan found perfect rest and his blessed,
   "Pilgrim's Progress," remains a proof of the joy of heart which the
   poor tinker found when he came to rest in Christ.

   Now, if within these walls there is a case in which poverty combines
   with sickness and disease. And if that poverty and disease are the
   result of vice. And if that vice has been carried on for many
   years--and if the entire man is now depressed and despondent, like one
   shut up in an iron cage--the Lord Jesus can still give rest in such a
   case! It matters not how black or horrible is your condition! If you
   believe in Jesus, you shall be delivered. As far as this trouble of
   soul is concerned and as far as the venom of sin in your nature is
   concerned, you shall be healed! You shall be made pure, though now you
   are filthy! You shall be restored, though now you are fallen! You shall
   be started again in life by a power that shall cause you to be born
   again, so that you shall be as though you were a little child
   commencing life again, only under happier skies and holier influences!

   My Lord and Master has a power to comfort which reaches to the
   uttermost of human necessity. Some go a long way in sin and doubt, but
   they cannot rush beyond the uttermost and, therefore, they are within
   the boundaries of Divine Grace! Let the wind drive the bird far off the
   shore, yet the Lord has a rest for it in another land. Still does Jesus
   bid us sound the great trumpet and ring out the notes both clear and
   shrill--"Come to Me! Come to Me! Come unto Me, all you that labor and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest!" Blessed shall those ears be
   that hear the sound if their hearts obey it and come to Jesus--they
   will find rest at once! He is able. He is able to give rest. He is
   willing to cause joy. Doubt no more! Jesus speaks thus without reserve
   because He is conscious of power, for note this--Jesus Christ is God
   and He that made men's hearts can make them all anew!

   The God at whose bidding sprang that mighty arch of the blue sky--who
   poured out the sea from the hollow of His hands and named the stars in
   their hosts--He is able to save unto the uttermost them that come to
   Him! This blessed God took upon Himself our nature and became Man and,
   being found in fashion as a man, He took men's grief and sin upon
   Himself and went up to the Cross loaded with it. And there He suffered
   in our place to make expiation for our guilt. There is such merit in
   His precious blood that no sin can ever overpower it! I can see man's
   sin before me--it towers aloft, defying Heaven! It rises like an awful
   alp shrouded in a storm of evil! It seems to thread the clouds, to be
   higher than the stars! Oh, mighty mountain, what shall become of you?

   But, lo! I see Christ's precious blood and merit like an ocean of Grace
   poured forth to cover sin! Comparable to Noah's deluge, the power of
   the Atonement is revealed till, 20 cubits upward, the tops of the
   mountains of our sin are covered and not a speck of them remains--while
   on the top of the waters rides the ark of everlasting salvation--and
   all that believe in Jesus are safe, and safe forever! Oh, Sinner,
   Christ is able to cast your sins into the depths of the sea so that
   they shall never be mentioned against you again and thus He will give
   you the most serene rest. "Come to Me," He says, "and I will give you
   rest."

   I wish I knew how to put this so that it would get into men's hearts.
   My Master knows that He can save you, for He had reckoned up every
   possible case before He spoke so positively. His Prescient eye
   discerned all men that have ever lived or that ever shall live--and He
   perceived you, dear Friend, whom nobody else knows. You up in the
   corner there, whom nobody understands, not even yourself--He
   understands you and He is able to give rest to your eccentric mind! He
   meant this promise to ring down the ages till it reached you! We have
   nearly completed the 19th Century, but if ever we

   should get to the 119th Century, His power to give rest will still be
   the same. Still will He cry--"Come unto Me, all you that labor and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest."

   Oh, the vastness of my Master's power, that in all ages and all places,
   to all the children of man He promises perfect rest of heart if they
   will but come to Him! Will not you come at once and test that power? Oh
   that the Holy Spirit may incline you to do so!

   IV. Now, fourthly, and this is a very important point, I want you to
   notice THE SIMPLICITY OF THIS INVITATION. It only says, "Come to Me,
   come to Me, come to Me, and I will give you rest." The call is, as we
   say, plain as a pikestaff--it has not a fine word in it. What is the
   way of salvation? If any minister replies, "I should need a week or two
   to explain it to you," he does not know the way of salvation because
   the way of salvation which we need must suit a dying man, an illiterate
   man and a guilty man, or else it will be unavailing in many cases! We
   need a way of Grace which will answer all occasions--a mode of
   salvation suitable to all conditions!

   Our Lord Jesus Christ proves how willing He is to save sinners by
   making the method of Grace so easy. He says, "Come to Me." "Well," asks
   one, "how am I to come?" Come any way. If you can run, come running. If
   you can walk, come walking. If you can creep, come creeping. If you can
   only limp, come limping--come any way--so long as you come to Jesus.
   "But what is coming to Him?" asks one. "If He were at York, I would
   walk to York, tonight, to get at Him." He is not at York any more than
   He is here. We are not to come to Him with our persons, or with our
   legs and feet by a visible motion. How, then, can we come to Him?
   Listen, you Friends in the front gallery, how can I come to you, and
   yet stand here? Why, by thinking about you, knowing about you and then
   confiding my thoughts to you, as I am now doing!

   If you, over yonder, are a business man, I resolve in my mind that I
   will commit my affairs into your hands--and in so doing I have mentally
   come to you. We are to do with our Lord Jesus just what we do with a
   physician. We are very ill. It is a bad case. We hear that a certain
   eminent doctor has great skill in one particular disease. So, we go to
   him at once. Our physical going is not so much required as our mental
   resort to him, by putting our case into his hands. We say to him, "Sir,
   here is my afflicted person. I will tell you all about my state as far
   as I know it. Ask me any questions. I will make a clean breast of all.
   Whatever you prescribe for me, I will take. Whatever regimen you lay
   down as to diet, I will follow. I place myself entirely in your hands
   because I have faith in your skill. You cured my mother of this
   disease. You cured my brother and I believe you can cure me." Such is
   faith in Christ!

   A man says, "Jesus, You have died to save men, and You have revealed
   Yourself as a Savior. I need saving. You have saved a great many like
   I. I now put myself into Your hands. I will do what You bid me. I will
   follow any directions You may lay down, I confide myself to You." Now,
   if this is a genuine surrender and a hearty confidence, you are already
   a healed man! Your power to trust Christ is evidence of spiritual
   sanity--you would not have been able to trust the blessed Jesus if a
   sound work of restoration had not already commenced in you. "Oh," says
   one, "do I understand, then, that if I trust Christ, I may do as I
   like?" Stop, stop! I never said that!

   Listen and learn! Here is a ship which cannot get into the haven. The
   pilot comes on board. The captain says, "Pilot, can you get her into
   harbor?" "Yes, Captain, 1 will guarantee it. I will guarantee that I
   will get the ship into harbor if you leave her with me." The captain
   goes to the helm, or gives orders as to steering the vessel, and at
   once the pilot objects that they are not trusting to him. "Yes, I am,"
   says the captain, "and I expect you to get me into harbor, for you
   promised to do so." "Of course I promised," replies the pilot, "but
   then it was understood that I should take charge of the ship for the
   time being." He orders the helm to be changed and the captain declares
   that it shall not be done. Then cries the pilot, "I cannot get you into
   the harbor and I will not pretend to do so! Unless you trust me, I can
   do nothing, and the proof that you trust me is that you obey my
   orders."

   Now, then, trust Jesus, so as to be obedient to Him and He will pilot
   you safely. Yield yourself up to follow His example, to imitate His
   spirit and obey His commands and you are a saved man! Your ship shall
   not be driven out to sea while Jesus steers it. But do not go away
   under the delusion that you have only to say, "I trust Christ," and
   that you are saved. Nothing of the kind! You must really trust
   Him--practically trust Him, or there is no hope for you. Give yourself
   up to Jesus; renounce your old sins; forsake your old habits; live as
   Christ will enable you to live and immediately you shall find peace for
   your soul! You cannot enjoy rest and yet riot in sin! Shall the drunk
   have rest and yet drown his soul in his cups?

   Shall an adulterer have rest and wallow in his filthiness? Shall a man
   blaspheme and have rest? Shall a man be a rogue and a liar and have
   rest? Impossible! These things must be given up by coming to Jesus
   Christ, who will help you to give them up and make a new man of
   you--and then you shall receive rest in your soul. Come to Him, then,
   in spirit and in truth. Oh, that you would come to Him while I am
   speaking--and find instantaneous rest for your souls!

   V. I must not keep you longer and so I want, upon the last point, to
   briefly call your attention to THE UNSELFISHNESS OF THE LORD, JESUS
   CHRIST, "Come unto Me," He says, "and I will give you." That is the
   Gospel. "I

   will give you." You say, "Lord, I cannot give You anything." He does
   not need anything! Come to Jesus and He says, "I will give you." Not
   what you give to God, but what He gives to you, will be your salvation!
   "I will give you"--that is the Gospel in four words. Will you come and
   have it? It lies open before you. Jesus needs nothing from you. Suppose
   you were to become Christ's disciple and serve Him with all your might
   throughout your life--in what way would that enrich Him? He has died
   for you! How can you ever pay Him for that?

   He lives in Heaven to plead for you and He loves you--how can you ever
   reward Him for that? Our hope is not in what we can give to Him, but in
   what He gives to us! Weak-minded men have taken pleasure in
   flagellating themselves, starving themselves, shutting themselves up in
   monasteries, lacerating their bodies and torturing their minds--to what
   purpose were these pains? Did the loving Jesus require this of them?
   Could such miseries afford His tender heart the least pleasure? Not at
   all! He has no pleasure in human misery, but He desires that His joy
   may be fulfilled in us that our joy may be full.

   I see before me a springhead from which the clearest crystal water is
   always leaping with a gladsome sound. A little stream, which this
   spring creates, runs down the meadow--you can track it by the long
   grass, reeds, rushes and tangled wildflowers which drink their life
   from it. In summer and in winter the crystal fountain never ceases to
   pour forth its treasures. Come here when you may, you shall see the
   silver jet spurting forth and splashing up, again, from the stones upon
   which it falls. How musical the sound! Listen! The spring is pleading,
   quietly but plaintively. It would become a greater blessing if it could
   but gain the means, and so it sighs and whispers, Buckets! Pitchers!
   Goblets! Cups! It longs to fill them all! Look, here are a couple of
   pails, but they are empty. Yes, they are all the better for the
   purpose--full buckets would not help the spring to dispense its water.

   Here is a cup, but it is a very little one. Never mind, fill it and
   bring many like it. This girl has brought a jug, but it is spotted with
   dirt. We bid her take it away, lest she pollute these sparkling waters.
   Not so, the spring pleads, and this is its pleading--"Bring it here, I
   will cleanse it and then fill it to the brim." Need I expound the
   parable? I hope not! Come and act it out, you little ones or great
   ones, you empty ones or unclean ones! Thus shall you know more surely
   and more sweetly than words can tell you how free and full is the Grace
   of our Lord Jesus Christ! The emptier you are, the better can you
   receive from our overflowing Savior! He longs to bless you for your own
   sake. His yearnings are all unselfish-- they are yearnings to give,
   longings to bestow favor.

   He cries, even now, to laboring and laden souls, "Come unto Me, and I
   will give you not only rest, but all you require." Friends, have you
   learned well the lesson that there is nothing good in yourselves with
   which to attract Jesus, but all the good is in Him to attract you? Is
   it not clear enough that physicians do not come to heal healthy
   persons? I saw a carriage dashing down the street with a doctor in it
   and I felt morally certain that he was not coming to my house, for I am
   in perfect health. I dare say he was hastening to see a poor creature
   who was on the brink of the grave. When I see the chariots of mercy
   flashing with winged steeds through the air, I know that they are not
   speeding to you who are good and righteous and think you do not need a
   Savior--they are hastening to such as are sinful and crave forgiveness,
   to such as are guilty and require a change of heart--for these are they
   that Jesus comes to bless!

   See, then, how the unselfishness of His Character comes out in His
   inviting to come to Himself those who cannot benefit Him, but must be
   pensioners on His bounty! "I will give you rest." Men, brothers, women,
   sisters--all of you-- this is the final word. The day is coming when we
   shall all sigh for rest. We need it badly, now, and if we have it not,
   we are leading a pitiful life. Those poor rich people in the west end
   that have no Christ, how can they bear their irksome idleness, the
   satiety and disgust of unenjoyed abundance? Those poor people in the
   east end that have no Christ--what they do without Him, I cannot tell.
   Alas, for their poverty and suffering, but what are these to their
   wretchedness in being Christless?

   Those of us who have all that heart can wish, still feel that we could
   never be happy if we were not resting in our dear Savior! How, then, do
   the starving exist without Him? But we shall soon die and what then? A
   young man said to his father some little while ago, "Father, I am
   prospering in business wonderfully! If I get on at this rate, what will
   it come to?" "Come to a grave," said his father. And so it will. All
   things of earth end there. Oh that we were always ready to die, for
   then we should be ready to live! He that is ready to live tomorrow is
   ready to die tomorrow. There is no need that death should be a hitch in
   our existence. Life ought to run on as a river pursues its way and
   widens into the sea. Our existence, here, should glide into our
   existence there, but that cannot be unless we get on the right track
   while we are here. If we are on the right track, now, which is
   believing, loving, fearing, serving and honoring God, we shall go on
   loving, fearing and honoring God forever and ever!

   "Come," says Christ, "Come to Me." What will Jesus say at the Judgment
   Day to those who so come? Why, He will say, "Come"--"Come, you blessed
   of My Father. Keep on coming. Come and inherit the Kingdom prepared for
   you from before the foundations of the world." Ah, my Hearers, you will
   prize this coming when death and eternity are near you! I am glad to
   see this great company gathered here, but before I came into this
   house, I felt much heaviness of heart and it has not gone from me even
   now. To stand here and look into familiar faces from Sunday to Sunday
   is infinitely more pleasant than to look upon so many, the most of whom
   I have never seen before, for you cause me new anxieties that I may do
   good to you, also.

   This was my thought--"I shall see them all, again, at the Judgment Day,
   and I shall be accountable as to whether I preached the Gospel to them
   with all my heart." I shall not have to answer for the blood of you
   all, because there are more Sabbaths than this one and more
   opportunities of hearing the Gospel than this. And on other Sundays,
   others preach to you, and these share the burden, or else you ignore
   the holy day--and in that case your blood will be on your own heads!
   Still, for this one service I mast answer to God for you all. If I have
   not preached Jesus Christ simply and plainly--and from my heart--if I
   have been cold, and dull, and dreary when speaking upon a theme that
   might arouse any man to burn and glow with seraphic flame, then I shall
   be censurable by Him that shall judge the quick and dead!

   If you think there is nothing in what I have said, reject it! I have no
   authority to preach it of my own head, for I am no great philosopher. I
   speak in the name of God and if you think I do, and believe that God
   has sent me, then I beseech you to lay hold of the Truth of God which
   has been held up before you! The most important thing a man can do is
   to attend to that which is most important--your soul is of more
   importance than your body and, therefore, your eternal life ought to
   secure more attention than your mere temporal existence. A man said the
   other day that he would die like a dog. Let him, if he likes, but I
   have no ambition in that direction. I want to live like an angel! If
   any man is content to be a dog, well, I know not what I can do for him
   but give him a bone--I did not know that he would care to come here, or
   I might have sent to the butcher's for fit food.

   But he that wishes to live forever should, at least, consider where he
   would live, with whom he would live and how he can secure happiness in
   such a life. If there is a God--and that there is a God is written in
   the very skies--I devoutly desire to have Him for my Friend. I think,
   as I look up to the stars, "I love the God that made those shining
   worlds. I worship Him, I desire to serve Him, I wish to be at peace
   with Him." And what has made me desire to serve Him and obey Him? Can
   it be a lie which has done this? Does a lie make a man love God and
   desire to serve Him? No. It is the Truth of God, then, that has made me
   be of obedient heart! The Gospel must be true, or it could not thus put
   men right with their Creator.

   O, my Beloved, trust your Savior! Lay hold on Jesus! Oh, may Christ lay
   hold on you at this good hour and cause you to enter into His rest!
   Amen and amen.

"Without Carefulness"

   (No. 1692)

   DELIVERED AT THE THURSDAY EVENING LECTURE,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I would have you without carefulness." 1 Corinthians 7:32.

   AT the time when Paul wrote these words he was giving judgment as to
   whether it was expedient for Christians in those days to marry. The
   question was whether they were likely to be better Christians married
   or unmarried. This was a question of much delicacy and Paul answered it
   with remarkable discretion and fidelity. And, in so doing, he laid down
   a great general principle which is of much more value to the Church,
   today, than Paul's private opinion about the matter of marriage or
   non-marriage. Paul tells us that concerning virgins, he had no
   commandment of the Lord, but gave his judgment as one that had obtained
   mercy of the Lord to be faithful--he did not speak, in this case, as
   under Divine Inspiration, but as an experienced and consecrated man
   giving his judgment for the good of others--and for the benefit of the
   great work so dear to him.

   In that capacity, Paul's words are, by no means, to be despised. I had
   far rather follow the uninspired advice of Paul than that of any other
   man. In mental clearness none ever excelled that consecrated man. But
   he spoke under Inspiration, beyond all question, when he gave this as
   his reason for desiring that they would remain unmarried--"I would have
   you without carefulness," or as the Revised Version reads it, "I would
   have you to be free from cares." This is the mind of the Holy Spirit as
   well as the mind of the Apostle Paul. This is a text, not for Paul's
   time, alone, but for our time and for all time.

   The general principle in our text I will endeavor to open up before
   you. We who have believed are the servants of Christ and are no longer
   at our own disposal. We are not our own, for we are bought with a
   price. If you look back in the chapter, at the 23rd verse, you find a
   statement to that effect. Hence our business in life is to serve Him
   who has redeemed us. This one occupation should entirely absorb and
   engross us. Everything, therefore, which helps us better serve the Lord
   Jesus is a good thing--and everything which hampers and hinders us in
   the main business of our life, though it may be good enough for others,
   is bad for us. The chief work of the Christian is to glorify God and,
   to this chief work everything must be subordinated. If a thing is
   lawful to me, and yet, while lawful, it hinders me in the service of
   God, it is not expedient and, therefore, I am to renounce it.

   No man ever succeeds in anything who does not give himself wholly to
   it--it matters not what it is--concentration is essential to perfection
   in any pursuit. He who would be eminent in any one direction must
   forego a great many other things which are perfectly allowable. These
   he must renounce for the sake of his one objective. He will not succeed
   unless he sacrifices all other things for the one chief thing. So must
   it be with the Christian. The rule of his life is to be, "This I will
   not do, this I will not enjoy, this I will not allow for myself because
   I could not serve God as well with it, and my business is to keep
   myself in the best possible form for doing my Master's work." We are to
   labor as much as we can for our Lord and all other results of life must
   be to us as chaff to the wheat.

   It is with us, Paul tells us, as with a soldier. A soldier is a man who
   must not open shop, or become a banker or a farmer. He must not think
   of settling quietly in the town where, for a while, he is billeted. Why
   not? The reason is clear--even if there is no war at the present time,
   yet no man that wars, entangles himself with the things of this life if
   he would please him who has called him to be a soldier. Soldiering
   requires the man to be altogether a soldier and it cannot afford to let
   him be a tradesman or a farmer--he must not hamper himself with that
   which would hold him to the spot and prevent his hastening to the
   field. The nation requires that its army be ready for any and every
   emergency, so that when the trumpet blows, the regiment marches, the
   troopship steams across the sea, and the foe is promptly confronted. It
   is necessary that the soldier keep himself in marching condition and
   the less luggage he has to carry, the better.

   So it is with the Christian--he is to aim at a condition best adapted
   for his holy warfare. He is not to be satisfied when he has said to
   himself, "Is this right, or is this wrong?" He is to go further. I hope
   that many of us have long passed beyond that stage, for we have a
   judgment and discernment which tell us at once what is right and what
   is wrong--we now ask a still higher question--"Will this help me to
   glorify God, or will it not?" This is the enquiry of the higher life
   and a godly man is careful in the answering of it. The best thing is
   bad if it hinders our vocation. Though the garment were made of silk,
   bespangled with jewels and made with golden thread, yet must we, as
   racers, lay it aside if it would entangle us in our running.

   Though the burden were a bag of pearls and every pearl were a king's
   ransom, yet if we are to run--and none can win but those that run--we
   must leave that bag of pearls in another's keeping, for our business is
   with the crown before us! We must lay aside every weight and the
   vesture of sin which does so easily entangle us, that we may run with
   patience the race that is set before us. At this time the Apostle says
   to us--"I would have you without carefulness as to earthly things," and
   this because he would have us full of carefulness as to heavenly
   things! He wants us to be free from cares, that all our thought,
   anxiety, meditation, suggestiveness, inventiveness and burden-bearing
   may go towards the service of our Divine Lord. We have only a certain
   measure of mind and he wants all of it for the Lord Jesus, that we may
   walk worthy of our high calling.

   But towards other things, he says, "I would have you without
   carefulness." How are we to be without carefulness? This must be the
   work of the Holy Spirit, for He is the Comforter and the Helper of our
   infirmities, But as far as we are to work with Him, the question needs
   a careful reply. How are we to be without carefulness?

   I. I answer--we may hopefully attempt this in the power of God, first,
   BY AVOIDING THOSE STATES WHICH INVOLVE CAREFULNESS. Mark well, it is
   not given to many to select their place in life. More or less it may be
   committed to us to turn to the right or to the left on certain
   occasions, but men and women are thrown into certain conditions in
   which it may be their duty to abide in their calling, though it may
   surround them with special difficulties. That calling may be one which,
   ordinarily, involves a vast amount of care and anxious thought and yet
   they cannot get out of it. They ought not to leap the hedge which the
   Lord has placed along their way, for if they do, they may fall into a
   ditch on the other side, muddy their garments, and so make matters
   worse. By crying to God for help and trusting in His sure Word, they
   will be able to bear the burden which God has put upon them and, it is
   their wisdom to do so.

   Yet there are points in which we are allowed a choice about the state
   in which we would place ourselves and here our text comes in as a rule
   of action. Paul, in the case before us, is talking about the marriage
   of Christians and he bids Christians, in the first place, not to marry,
   for, he says, "I would have you without carefulness. He that is
   unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
   please the Lord. But he that is married cares for the things that are
   of the world, how he may please his wife."

   Now, observe the condition of affairs which led Paul to give this
   advice. Times of great persecution were present. Christians were
   continually being dragged into court or set before the lions in the
   amphitheatre, or shut up in prison, or put to cruel deaths--in such
   circumstances few would desire to have families about them. The
   Christian man who had no wife or child could flee in a moment if it
   were right to flee. Or, when he stood before the bar of Nero, he had
   not to think within himself, "If I die, I leave a wife and fatherless
   children." When the single man put on his hat, he housed all his
   family, and thus he could move this way or that way to preach the
   Gospel, or to escape from persecution--and his moving was no great
   affair such as would be involved in transporting a family from land to
   land.

   Paul wished the Church to be like an army which is not encumbered with
   baggage. The circumstances of the time demanded that they should be
   unencumbered, like troops upon forced marches. Paul, himself, carried
   all his property in a little bit of canvas--it consisted of half a
   dozen needles and a reel of thread, with which he made tents wherever
   he went. He was thus without carefulness. In those hard and desperate
   times, it was the best possible thing that a man could do, or a woman,
   to remain single--they were thus in the best condition for flight, or
   suffering, or service, or death. It was not a time in which they could
   settle down and engage in trade or agriculture and Paul, therefore,
   gives, as a recommendation, that they had better not then be married.

   If we get into such times, again, we will give the same advice, but we
   are not certain that we should speak thus, today, as a general rule.
   The circumstances are decidedly different and we are to follow the
   great principle rather than the particular instance. I have known
   Brothers who, I am sure, had a great deal more care before they were
   married than ever

   they had afterwards. Poor things that they were, they needed somebody
   to look after them! I have known cases in which women have had great
   care and burden in their single state, but have found rest in the house
   of a husband and, it has been upon the whole, the best for them in the
   truest sense. They served God better and were freer from carefulness in
   the married state. That is the rule to judge by.

   But numbers of you never judge at all in this way! Many men and women
   rush into marriage when they know that it must involve them in all
   sorts of care and trouble--and deprive them of the possibility of doing
   anything in the Master's service. It is not for me to offer advice, for
   it is useless. I am often asked for advice, but I generally find that
   people have made up their minds long before they come to their
   minister! They only want him to sanction what they have already settled
   and, therefore, I very seldom give any advice. Still, I shall lay down
   the general principle which every Christian man and woman must
   accept--"I would have you to be free from cares," You are to put this
   to the front, that you are not your own, you are bought with a price.

   And about this matter of marriage, as well as everything else, you are
   to consult the will of your Lord and Master, and you are to put this as
   the question, "Shall I glorify God better married or unmarried? May I
   hope that I shall not so greatly increase my carefulness as to distract
   myself from serving my Lord? There is something to be said on each
   side, but may I hope that the balance may be struck so that I shall
   really be the better servant of Christ in the marriage state? If so, I
   may enter upon it, but if not, I am not to gratify myself at my
   Savior's expense. I may not marry if I should, then, cease to be as
   good a servant of Christ as I am now." None of you are too good
   servants of Christ--I have never met with any that were! We cannot
   afford to lose anything which we already have, for we are not even,
   now, all that we ought to be. No, we must give ourselves
   whole-heartedly to Christ and remember the admonition of the text, "I
   would have you without carefulness."

   We have got over that somewhat difficult part of our road which is
   concerned with marriage. We come to another which is very plain, but
   needs to be spoken of, namely, the matter of increased worldly
   business. Some forget this advice of the Apostle altogether. Regarding
   it as a check upon enterprise, such persons take up a number of
   businesses and, consequently, increase their cares indefinitely! Now,
   if you can serve God better by having a dozen shops, have a dozen. But
   I have known persons whom God blessed in one shop and they lost the
   blessing when they felt they needed to open two or three. In a moderate
   business, they obtained a livelihood and all that they could need--and
   they were able to get out to the House of God and to have spare hours
   for the service of God in the Sunday school, in preaching, or other
   forms of Christian service. Thus they were in an enviable position for
   usefulness and ought to have been pillars in the house of the Lord.

   But they were not content with so favored a state! Nothing would do for
   them but they must have shop number two, three, four and then, of
   course, they were too busy to go out on week evenings, to lectures,
   classes, or Prayer Meetings. When invited to take their part in the
   Lord's work, they replied--"You see, I cannot get out. You must excuse
   me, I am so tired." Just so. Of course you must look after business,
   now that you are so immersed in it, but how did you come to get into
   such a state of bondage that you cannot get out to the worship or
   service of God? Is not your excessive toil your own fault? If you have
   brought yourself into such a condition that you cannot give to God His
   due, is it an excuse for your not being able to do it? The disability
   is entirely of your own creation--how can it excuse you?

   If this were the time, I could mention persons who were members of this
   Church whose departure from the way of righteousness was owing to a
   grasping spirit--and that grasping spirit has, in certain cases, led to
   a foolish rush after riches which has ended in poverty and discredit!
   They had as much as they could have managed, but they wanted more, and
   more, and more--and to get more they ventured upon ways and methods
   which were questionable. By-and-by, the means of Grace were neglected
   because they must attend to business. Very soon, for the same reason,
   they could not get up on Sunday morning, they were so tired--they did
   not get the shop shut till twelve--and then there was clearing up till
   half-past one, so they could not get out on a Sunday morning.

   Worse than that, after a while they just looked over the ledger a
   little on Sunday afternoon. Soon the very vitals of godliness were gone
   and, not long after that, the name to live went, also--for the power of
   godliness had entirely departed from them. "I would have you without
   carefulness" and, therefore, to the most enterprising Brother, I would
   say--Brother, do not fill your pocket at the expense of your soul! Do
   what is best for the best part of yourself and that best part of
   yourself is the soul which deals with God and eternity! God can prosper
   you and make you exceedingly happy

   with a more manageable business and He can make you miserable if you
   willfully increase your cares. The Lord Jesus said, "A man's life
   consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses."

   Therefore, as I would have you without carefulness, look well, my dear
   Friend, before you launch out into that new business, or take that
   off-hand farm, or enter upon that speculative operation. Do not wade
   into risks so deep that you will be drowned in anxiety! Remember how
   Napoleon tried to do too much, and did it, and did for himself. Men of
   large capacity may rule an empire and yet serve the Lord admirably, but
   the most of us had better be satisfied with a smaller sphere. At any
   rate, let us not heap up such a load of our own that we shall not be
   able to bear the burden which our Master would have us carry for His
   love's sake.

   Do not look so cross, good Friend, or I shall think that my advice is
   more necessary to you than it is pleasing! The day may come when this
   warning will be better understood by you than at this moment. Some
   Christian men need to have a touch on the elbow about public
   engagements. For my part, I believe that everything which concerns a
   man concerns a Christian, and that God never wished His servants to
   leave the government of this realm to all the place-hunters and
   unprincipled self-seekers who look for a seat in Parliament. Christian
   men ought to see to it that right is promoted and justice done. To
   abandon Law-making to the worst of men would be infamous! So with
   everything which concerns the public welfare, I believe that we are to
   turn the scale for truth and righteousness, and are not to let the
   devil have his way and give robbery and oppression the run of all the
   parishes in England.

   But there is a limit to a man's acceptance of public office and let
   that limit be watched carefully by all the Lord's children. Let the
   rule be--first our God and then our fellow men. What if I am a patriot,
   yet first of all the New Jerusalem is the place of my citizenship! I am
   a pilgrim and a stranger--and even though I seek the good of these
   aliens among whom I dwell, I must still keep my eye upon my own native
   country, towards which I am speeding. A man must not be doing 20 things
   in public life and neglecting the calls of the Lord Christ. If he does
   this, he will have care upon care, and will weary and trouble himself
   with things of no profit--and he will not care for the things of God as
   he should. Brothers and Sisters, "I would have you without
   carefulness"--you are the servants of God--do not make yourselves the
   slaves of men!

   Here I wish to say another word to some whose occupations prevent their
   attendance at the House of God. I am not going to censure or judge any,
   but I will say this--whenever I hear of a young man who has an
   occupation with a moderate salary, who is able to get out to worship
   and has the whole Lord's-Day to himself, so that he can help in the
   Sunday school and, perhaps, in some week-evening engagements--if I hear
   that he is offered twice as much money in a place where he must be shut
   out from worship and service, I hope he will look long before he makes
   the bargain. If part of the Sabbath must go and all week-night
   privileges must go, I would, in most cases, say, "My Brother, forego
   the temporal advantage for the sake of the spiritual." There may be
   exceptions to rules and I lay down nothing as a hard-and-fast rule, but
   still, let this be the general guide in such matters--"I would have you
   without carefulness."

   If it is so that he who has less, has less care, let me have less! He
   who has a moderate income, with small responsibility, is a richer man
   than he who has twice as much, with twice as much responsibility--and
   only half as much opportunity of serving his God. For you, Christians,
   the best place you can have is where you can do most for Jesus--and the
   worst place you can have is where you are denied Christian privileges.
   No amount of salary can make up to you the disadvantage of being kept
   from the assemblies of the saints, or can make up to your soul the loss
   sustained by excessive labor in the house of bondage. "I would have you
   without carefulness."

   This bears very hard upon all those forms of speculation of which some
   men are so fond. A man says, "I believe that I can get rich in a hurry
   by a certain venture." Do not touch it! You will have no end of care
   and it may bring absolute poverty upon you. You have heard of the man
   who hurried to be rich and was not innocent. I am afraid that few are
   long innocent who hasten to be rich! They clutch at everything on a
   sudden and they are apt to include in that clutch a few things which do
   not belong to them! What devouring care must prey upon those whose
   trade is as risky as a throw of the dice? When business is mere
   gambling, it ceases to be legitimate! Let speculators take heed of
   those dangers which necessarily attend all games of chance. I believe
   that every form of gambling, though it may take a business shape, tends
   more, or less, to harden the heart.

   As for the naked form of play which risks upon the roll of a ball, it
   is murder to all the finer feelings of the heart! Nobody but gamblers
   could have cast the dice, all blood bespattered, at the foot of the
   Cross of our Redeemer! Gambling

   brings men into a state of heart worse than almost any other form of
   sin. When a man is willing to risk practically his all on the mere toss
   of a halfpenny whether goods shall go up or down, he is usually a bad
   man. And if he is not, he will be so before long, for that kind of
   thing does serious mischief to the most tender tissues of the heart. If
   any Christian man attempts it, what a state of mind will he soon know!
   Can he pray? Can he meditate? Can he commune with the Lord Jesus? Can
   he be without carefulness? Where can his trust be? Where his faith in
   God? When he has practically committed his fortunes to the devil, how
   can he confide in his God?

   Gambling and prayer can never go together except in the case of the
   reprobate--I suppose they are profane enough to unite the two--but
   therein they blaspheme Heaven most detestably! Brothers and Sisters,
   abstain from those things which inevitably create undue excitement,
   anxiety and suspense. I speak as unto wise men--judge you what I say--I
   would have you without carefulness and, therefore, I would have you
   avoid those states which involve it.

   I. Secondly, BY KEEPING AWAY FROM THOSE OBJECTS OF PURSUIT WHICH WOULD
   NATURALLY FOSTER IT, I would have you without carefulness. When a man
   makes the gaining of riches the first thing in life, he cannot be
   without carefulness. Where his treasure is, there will his heart be,
   also. There is the carefulness to get, the carefulness to hold, the
   carefulness to place out at interest, the carefulness to collect dues
   and so forth. Yes, and this may be the case, even, with poor people who
   may be as full of greedy care as the millionaire! Thrift is
   commendable, but covetous-ness is detestable. Men not only lay by for a
   rainy day, which is well--but when they make saving the main object of
   their lean and hungry lives--God's Glory and man's needs are, alike,
   forgotten.

   Now, if you live for anything but God--especially if you live to hoard
   up with the determination that somehow or other you will be immensely
   rich--you must be full of carefulness. It cannot be helped. Suppose
   that you are of a nobler spirit and you live with the view of gaining
   honor among men--you will, with equal certainty, be full of cares. I
   hope you will not say, "I must be honored. I must have my neighbors
   think well of me and I will make a slave, or a fool, or a hypocrite of
   myself to please them." This resolve is detestable and if you go into
   that line you will not be without carefulness, I can tell you--and with
   all your carefulness you will never succeed. To please everybody is as
   impossible as to make ice and bake bread at the same moment in one
   oven. Give up the wretched attempt!

   Be a man and be not a mere man-pleaser. How blessedly easy I feel in my
   work for God! But I owe that ease to the fact that I have no one to
   please but my Lord. When I preach, the last thing that ever occurs to
   me is to ask myself whether any of you will like it or not. It is no
   wish of mine to give offense, but it has never occurred to me to think
   whether you will be offended or not. I do not think you would respect
   me if I made my preaching an occasion for seeking to please you. If it
   pleases God, it will please you, if you are right--and if you are wrong
   and it does not please you-- well, it never ought to please you!

   This enables a preacher to give all his mind to his subject. The
   opposite feeling would distract him and make him live the life of a
   toad under a harrow. Go into life in just that kind of spirit--do
   everything to please your fellow man if it will do him real good. Never
   be ungenerous, nor unkind, nor uncourteous, but never live to please
   the world. No slave is so slavish as the wretch who draws his breath
   from other people's nostrils and can only live if he is approved by his
   neighbors. Scorn such servitude! I would have you without carefulness
   and you cannot be without carefulness if you only seek to please men.
   Many persons are so ambitious to be respectable that they never will be
   without carefulness--they have a pound coming in but they spend a
   guinea to be respectable--and so they cannot be without carefulness. I
   charge you do not care about being what is known in the world as
   "respectable." Be Christians, whether people respect you or not!

   That littleness which stamps out everything that is good or brave in
   order to put a man into the fashion is to be the object of our supreme
   contempt! Do right. Serve God. Live for Heaven. Care little about man's
   esteem. Abhor the pride of life. Live above the world, or you will be
   eaten up with carefulness--it cannot be helped. Some persons have a
   favorite objective in life--not God, but an earthly thing--and these
   cannot be without carefulness. Dear mother, love your children by all
   manner of means, but if that little one has become an idol, I am sure
   you cannot be without carefulness! I have known mothers kill their
   children because they did not want them to die. That is to say, they
   never let the wind blow on them--they kept them in a box, screened the
   blessed air of Heaven from them--and so brought them up that they
   became weak and sickly, thanks to their mothers' indulgent care. Lots
   of children have suffered a martyrdom from too much nursing! Excessive
   carefulness has created cause for care.

   If it is not a child, if it is anything else that becomes the pet and
   hobby of life, you will soon find that you have plenty of care about
   it--a horse, a dog, a flower, a painting may entangle men and women in
   nets of care. I have seen it and lamented it. The more objects you set
   your heart upon, the more thorns there are to tear your peace of mind
   into shreds. I know people who dread every puff of wind and every
   shower of rain because a yacht might be tossed about, or a garden-party
   spoiled--such trifles may sensible people be troubled about! "What are
   we to do, then?" asks one. Why, live for God! Live wholly for God! Put
   everything else into its true place. Children, business, every favorite
   pursuit--leave them in the hands of God--for until you do this, you
   will be cankered with carefulness of one kind or another and be
   incapacitated for the joyful service of the Lord your God!

   Thus have I given you two helpful rules--first, avoid the states which
   involve carefulness. And secondly, avoid the pursuits which involve
   carefulness. May the Spirit of God help you to carry them out.

   III. But now, thirdly, and better still, I would have you without
   carefulness BY EXERCISING A CHILD-LIKE FAITH IN THE EVER-BLESSED GOD.
   He sends you troubles and trials, but be without carefulness, first, by
   never trying to anticipate them. Never meet them half-way. "Sufficient
   unto the day is the evil thereof." Oh, the strength it gives a man when
   he learns to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread"! It would be a
   poor prayer if a man should cry, "Lord, give me a guarantee of my bread
   for six months." No, no! The Lord never taught us to ask for that! That
   forestalling of the demands of the future finds no petition written for
   it. Our Lord would have us cultivate the feeling that whatever the
   necessity of the day, whatever the requirement of the day, whatever the
   trial of the day, we shall take it to God as it comes and He will, then
   and there, meet the case. Commit your way unto the Lord and then be
   without carefulness.

   I will now tell you something still better. If you can manage to live
   by the five minutes, that is better than living by the day. I am not,
   tonight, at 20 minutes past eight o'clock, allowed to fret myself about
   what is likely to happen at ten! I have Grace at this time for the
   present moment, but not for 10 o'clock. Why, therefore, should I hurry
   towards a trouble for which I am not yet prepared? Leave 10 o'clock
   worries till 10 o'clock comes! The hour that brings the trial will
   bring the strength! The hour that tests you, will find God ready at
   your hand to help you! Live by the day--yes, live by the hour.

   The next thing is, if you would be without carefulness, be quite
   content with the Lord's will. Suppose you do not prosper in business as
   you would like? Be content not to do so. Do your best and leave your
   prospering in the hands of God. Suppose that after consulting a
   physician you find that your complaint is not removed? Duly follow all
   right and wise prescriptions and directions--and then leave your health
   with God. With regard to those you love, when you have prayed for their
   restoration and they are not restored, then still say, "Not as I will,
   but as You will." If you cannot suit your purse to your wishes, bring
   your wishes to your purse! Higher still, if God does not give you all
   your desires, do the other thing--submit all your desires to God! When
   your desires and God's decrees agree, all will be well! Whether God
   gives you your wish, or you give up your wish, will make no notable
   difference. You will be equally happy so long as your will is God's
   will and God's will is your will.

   And I believe--and I speak experimentally--that when you are racked
   with pain, if God teaches you to submit, (and it is often a hard
   lesson), you can suffer in every limb and yet sing in your inmost soul!
   This is the way to live without carefulness--first, not to meet trouble
   before it comes and, next, when it does come--to be content, saying,
   "It is the Lord: let Him do what seems good to Him." The next thing is
   to be quite sure about the love of God. He cannot make a mistake and He
   cannot fail His people. If the worst thing, as it seems to us, should
   happen, it must be the right thing because God has sent it! Be sure,
   also, that when our needs come, God's supplies will come, too. The Lord
   is bound by His own promise to provide for all the real necessities of
   those who trust in Him. Oh, that we did thoroughly know God and did
   fully believe in Him! Then would our peace be as a river, and our joy
   like that of birds when the sun is rising. Then should we sing--

   "I have no cares,

   blessed Lord,

   For all my cares are Thine!

   1 live in triumph, too, for You Have made Your triumphs mine!"

   Another sweet thing would help us to be without care and that is to
   believe fully in the power of prayer--and in the fact that God does
   actually answer it. God will grant His children's desires and answer
   their prayers! We constantly meet with instances in which God does most
   manifestly come to the help of those that walk before Him aright. I
   personally met this week with a notable case. A dear Sister is left a
   widow, with three children. She wonders what she shall do for the
   morning's bread. There is none in the house. She thinks to herself that
   she formerly kept shop and that she has a few goods left, a little
   stained and soiled, but still saleable at a price. She goes into her
   room and prays God, in her agony of soul, to direct her to a customer.
   To her delight a person asks her whether she kept shop, once, at
   such-and-such a road.

   Yes, she is the individual. Such goods as she used to buy at the shop,
   this stranger cannot get anywhere else, and she much needs them. Could
   she tell her where she could get the like? Yes, these are the very
   goods that she had hoped to sell and, though a little soiled and
   stained, the enquirer is glad to have them! The very person who wants
   them has come to buy them before she has crossed the threshold to seek
   a customer and she is amazed at the goodness of the Lord! This honest
   woman is told that it was a mere coincidence--she says that she knows
   nothing about coincidences, but she blesses the Lord that her needs
   were supplied for the time--and she means to trust Him for the future!
   I did not attempt to alter her resolution to rely, in the future, upon
   God in time of trouble--on the contrary, I cheered her in it, for I
   would have her without carefulness.

   When my grandfather was a young man, before my days, he had a great
   family and a small income. He had a cow that he kept for his children
   and he went to fetch it up from the meadow. But when it was near the
   house, it was taken with "the staggers," and died. My grandmother said,
   "There, James, what shall we do, now, through the winter without the
   cow?" He replied, "My dear, God has provided for us and He always will,
   though I do not know how." And with a heavy heart he went to pray and
   lay his trouble before the Lord. I have heard the dear old man tell how
   that morning brought a post-letter, with nine pence to pay--and
   Grandmother said, "Troubles never come alone. Here is nine pence to pay
   for this letter. Shall we take it in?" But when she did take it in, it
   brought 20 pounds from a society in London, to which the good man had
   never applied! He could not make out how they knew of him at all! But
   the Lord knew and led them to send the money on the day of
   Grandfather's greatest need!

   These stories are a few out of many that are in my wallet--instances
   which I have gathered in my pilgrimage. I have seen enough, in my own
   lifetime, to fill a volume concerning the goodness of the Lord in
   answer to His children's prayers. When you are as sure that God answers
   prayer as I am sure of it, then you will realize the meaning of the
   text, "I would have you without carefulness." Some people of my
   acquaintance are full of carefulness. I know a maiden lady who
   possesses what many poor people would think to be wealth. She has a
   fixed, regular and ample income, but she will not spend it because she
   must first save a certain sum. At first her ambition was to have enough
   in hand to bury her. Why, she has enough already to bury 20 of her, but
   she keeps on nipping and scraping, still, and whenever you meet her she
   talks of how little she eats, and how dear everything is!

   She might live in plenty and have something for the cause of God, but
   instead of that, she has always an awful story about her expenses. I
   believe that if she were made into the Empress of China, she would be
   afraid that there would not be enough tea grown in China for her to
   drink! She is of such a spirit that she is a burden to herself and a
   plague to all who are about her! When you once give way to grumbling
   and grasping, then you are careful, and careful, and careful till you
   become good-for-nothing in the service of God. Do, I pray you, Brothers
   and Sisters, try to get rid of this disease, for your fretful
   carefulness will make you a misery to yourself and to your friends! It
   will destroy your power to do good and it will cut off your communion
   with God!

   If you do not trust God, God will not walk with you. I do not care to
   have a man of my acquaintance who does not believe in me. I cannot bear
   him if he is always mistrusting me. And so it is with God--He will not
   commune with you or smile upon you if you will not trust Him--but if
   you will leave everything with Him and believe that your heavenly
   Father knows best, you shall have many a kind word from His lips, and
   you shall find what a good, gracious, loving Father He is. Why, you and
   I ought to be as happy as the birds of the air and as merry as crickets
   on the hearth! Just think what a God we have, who will take care of us
   both in this life and in the life to come! All things are ours--the
   gifts of God-- the purchase of a Savior's love!

   Even our troubles are the best troubles in the world! Our cross is a
   heavy one, but it is the best cross for us. Each man has the cross
   which best fits him. You could not carry mine and I could not carry
   yours half as well as my own. Despite

   your peculiar trials, you are a happy and a favored man, and God has
   dealt infinitely better with you than you ever deserved or could have
   expected! Praise Him, then, and bless His name! Get out of the fidgets,
   Brother, if you can. Get out of the worries, my dear Sister. You are a
   good, dear housewife, and your husband says if he could get a little of
   the Mary into you, and a little of the Martha out of you, you would be
   a perfect wife! Is not this a practical suggestion? Let us see whether
   we cannot, each one, be improved by trying to be without carefulness.
   Let us, each one, give all our thought and care to this one object--How
   can I please God? How can I avoid sin? How can I be holy? How can I win
   sinners to Christ? How can I comfort my fellow Christians? How, in a
   word, can I live as Christ would have lived?

   You never find Jesus worrying. If He weeps, it is for the souls of men.
   If He suffers, it is to redeem men from going down to the Pit. And if
   He dies of a broken heart, it is a broken heart about the sins of
   others. As for Himself, what a delicious carelessness of holy
   confidence there was about Him! He went on board ship and He knew that
   a storm would come, a storm that would try the poor little boat, but He
   lay down and slept! The disciples are all in a worry. They cry,
   "Master, we perish!" And where was their Master? Asleep! You have often
   thought of the sleep of the Savior and almost deemed Him negligent.
   Now, think of the grand confidence of the Savior in being able to sleep
   in a storm! If His disciples had been asleep, too, it would have been
   the best thing they could have done, for they could not manage the
   winds or the waves. If they had possessed the moral dignity which
   ennobled their Lord and had been able to go down into the back part of
   the boat and to go to sleep with Him, they would have woke up in the
   morning in a calm.

   The best thing you, my dear Brothers and Sisters, can do in a great
   trouble may be to remember that text, "He gives His beloved sleep."
   Pray over your difficulty and then go to sleep--and wake up and find it
   all over--for the Lord has worked a great deliverance for you. I knew
   one, well, who was always in trouble about how he should die. Dear good
   man, he refused to be comforted, but was often troubled about the
   horrors of the departing hour--until one night he went to bed, shut his
   eyes on earth--and opened them in Glory! He never knew that he was away
   from earth till he knew that he was in Heaven, for he died in his
   sleep! And so it turned out that he had been worrying himself about
   nothing! Leave everything with God. If I can trust my soul with Him, I
   am sure I can trust my body with Him! If I can trust my eternal
   condition with Him, can't I trust Him with a matter of a five-pound
   note?

   What? Rest on Christ for Glory, and not rest on Christ for bread! Come,
   come! The Lord get you out of that low, unbelieving state! I am nearly
   at the close and so I press upon you my text. Like Paul, "I would have
   you without carefulness." May you be so, through the power of the
   gracious God who taught the Apostle Peter to say in the Spirit,
   "Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you." Amen.

That Horrible East Wind!

   (No. 1693)

   DELIVERED AT THE THURSDAY EVENING LECTURE,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you are also
   called in one body; and be you thankful." Colossians 3:15.

   I do not know how it is, but during the last two or three days I have
   been called to sympathize with an amount of sorrow such as I have
   seldom met with before in so short a space of time. One messenger of
   misery has followed on the heels of another, each one with heavy
   tidings. Nor is that all, for I have also been perplexed with a large
   amount of sinning, quarrelling and fault-finding. People are murmuring,
   grumbling, fretting and fighting on all sides. This has tried me so
   much that I feel little fitted to act as comforter, for I need comfort,
   myself. I have endeavored to cheer others till I have drunk of their
   cup of sorrow and put my own mouth out of taste--I have tried to make
   peace for others till I am half afraid of losing my own--I have
   answered the people's grumblings till I am tempted to have a growl or
   two on my own account.

   Perhaps I may relieve my own mind by the sermon which I hope to
   deliver. I said to one whom I greatly esteem, "I do not know how it is,
   but everybody seems out of sorts with everybody else just now." His
   wise answer was, "THE WIND IS IN THE EAST." This fact accounts for a
   great deal, for--

   "When the wind is in the east, 'Tis neither good for man nor beast."
   This is that ill wind which seems to blow no man any good. Some
   humanities feel the east wind terribly--it sets their teeth on edge and
   they feel that they must bite the first person they meet. I am glad to
   find some sort of excuse for my fellow Christians and, if I can find it
   nowhere but in the east wind, I will make the best I can of it. But I
   earnestly hope that the wind may soon blow from another quarter and not
   come from the east, again, till we have had a little respite and laid
   in a new stock of patience. If a cutting wind causes despondency,
   vexation, discontent and bad temper--may soft gales visit us frequently
   and bring us healing in their wings!

   As fair weather will not last forever, it will be well to prepare
   ourselves to breast the blast. It will never do for us to have a
   religion which can be killed by the wind--we must be made of better
   stuff than that! Yet this wind is blamed and I wish, therefore, that it
   would take itself off. If I could find a snug corner where the cruel
   east wind was never felt, I would feel inclined to promote an
   emigration movement for certain persons whom I will not mention! As for
   myself, I am afraid that it would not suit me to be altogether screened
   from the wind, for trials are necessary to one who is called to this
   ministry. Troubles and east winds will come to the servants of God and
   they are sent to do us good, for perhaps, if we could get our backs
   against a protecting wall and sit forever in the sunshine, with no east
   wind to interfere with us, we would go to sleep, or waking, we might
   come to love this world so well as to be loath to leave it!

   It would be a horrible thing for any one of us if the south wind should
   softly breathe upon our cheeks and whisper gently in our ears of
   long-continued joy to be found on earth--for then we would be tempted
   to sit down and say, "Soul, take your ease. You have, at last, found a
   place free from the trials of time. Therefore eat, drink and be merry,
   and let the future world care for itself." When I turn over in my mind
   the events of the last few days I do not suppose that there is more
   discord or discontent in the world just now than at any other time, but
   it happens that a number of black lines have all found their center in
   me and my thoughts have had to travel out in all those directions--all
   which is trying enough, but all the more so when the wind is in the
   east.

   It is a coincidence, but the same has happened before. I have had to
   unravel many tangled skeins in my time out of love to others. I did not
   get the threads into a ravel, but people are very fond of bringing me
   their snarls to disentangle and, when I have a hope of succeeding, I
   try my best. Gladly would I be a peacemaker, but it is much easier to
   make a

   snarl than to put it straight, again--especially in the east wind. I
   have tried to set things right and, meanwhile, I have asked myself, "Is
   there not a remedy for these mischiefs?" I feel assured there is such a
   remedy. Family discomfort, husbands and wives that cannot agree,
   domestic difficulties, brothers and sisters that fall out, Church
   troubles, members that are not treated kindly by others, (not generally
   the kindest sort of people, themselves, I notice), difficulties in
   business, difficulties in preaching--the world teems with these things!

   When the wind is in the east, we meet with many people who cannot earn
   enough wages, others who do not believe they were ever treated well
   since they were born. There are others, again, who are highly deserving
   people, but have never yet been appreciated as they should be. And
   these all come out in crowds when the wind is in the east. Good men
   become rabid for something new, find fault with old friends, invite
   debate and quarrel about nothing--and this happens most often when the
   wind is in the east. When this kind of spirit gets among Christian
   people, it is very sad. But surely there must be a remedy for it! Many
   nostrums are proposed, many quacks are ready to prescribe this and that
   form of remedy for troubles and discords, but the results of the east
   wind are not to be removed in that way--a higher power is needed.

   I have heard of pills for the earthquake and medicine for the
   comet--but I have no such patent medicine for the east wind! All I have
   to tell you is borrowed from an old Book in which the wisest
   prescriptions are to be found-- prescriptions so excellent that if they
   were followed, the inhabitant would no more say, "I am sick." This
   windy night I shall take you to the great Physician of souls,
   Jehovah-Rophi--The Lord Who Heals Us--who is able to cure all our
   diseases and to give permanent relief from all evil so that our spirits
   shall be at rest. I believe that we have a prescription in this verse,
   which, if it is well attended to, will deliver you out of all troubles,
   make you sing all your lives long, help you to travel from earth to
   Heaven and be, all the while, as happy as the birds in the air!

   Here it is--"Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you are
   also called in one body; and be you thankful." If we dissect our text,
   we shall find, in it, four pieces of advice.

   I. First, POSSESS THE PEACE OF GOD--"Let the peace of God rule in your
   hearts." It cannot rule in your hearts if you have never felt its
   power! Therefore, make certain that you are truly reconciled to God by
   Jesus Christ. Many persons have peace, but, alas, it is false peace.
   They have the peace of a soft, gentle, timorous, time-serving
   charac-ter--a mean sort of peace, which, if it hurts no one else, often
   ruins its possessor. Some have the peace of ignorance, the peace of
   stupidity, the peace of utter indifference--false peace. These are the
   followers of those false prophets who cried, "peace, peace," where
   there was no peace. Woe to the man whose peace of mind is like the
   deadly smoothness of the current just as it nears the waterfall!

   Many are at ease in a condition which might make a wise man's hair turn
   gray in a night. They were never emptied from vessel to vessel and,
   therefore, they are settled upon their lees--but they shall be poured
   out to their utter confusion. They think right well of themselves, but
   already the axe of judgment is lifted against them. The peace that we
   need to possess is the peace of God, which means, I think, first, peace
   with God. Oh, what a blessed thing it is to feel that the great cause
   of quarrel between our fallen spirit and the great Spirit is taken
   away--that we are reconciled to God by the death of His Son--that sin,
   the great divider, has been cast into the depths of the sea and that
   there is established between us and God, a happy fellowship!

   I hope many of you are, at this hour, enjoying such peace. If you have
   it, rejoice in it! If you, then, are at peace with God, do not
   perpetually act as if that peace were questionable and doubtful. Do not
   sigh and cry as if the matter trembled in the balance. If we believe in
   Jesus Christ, "being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ." Oh, the joy of knowing that, "as far as the
   east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from
   us" and that, therefore, they can never return from so immense a
   distance--yes, never return at all, for the Lord Jesus Christ has cast
   them into the depths of the sea--and if they are searched for, they
   shall not be found! Yes, they shall not be, says the Lord! Blessed is
   that man who has peace with God through the atoning blood!

   Growing out of this there comes, next, a peace with God with regard to
   all His Providences which can only come through a complete and entire
   submission to the Divine will, for some there are who are not at peace
   with God, even about a certain Providence that afflicted them years
   ago. They remain quarrelling with God about the decease of a beloved
   wife, or child, or mother--they cannot forgive God for having taken a
   flower out of His own garden. If they were wise, they would not thus
   rebel, but find in their loving Savior a recompense for all their
   losses. Was not that fine of An-

   dromache, when she remembered that she had lost all her relatives
   except her husband, and, gazing on him with delight, said--

   "While my Hector still survives, I see

   My father, mother, brethren, all in thee!" Cannot a Believer say the
   same of the Lord Jesus? Far be it from us to raise a question about
   what the Providence of God has already done! It must be right! The
   point is to keep on submitting to that Providence in what is now
   transpiring. If, for the present, the will of the Lord should send me
   poverty, obscurity, pain, weariness, reproach, I must be at peace with
   God about it all.

   If the Lord says to me, "Go across the sea and leave all your friends,"
   I must not delay. If He says, "Preach unwelcome Truths of God which
   will make you enemies," I must not hesitate. If He says, "Stay in the
   house with rheumatism," I must not come out of doors. If the Lord says,
   "Lie on your back and cough," it is not for me to quarrel with Him and
   say it ought not to be so. If He denies us that which we think would
   make us not only more happy, but more useful, it is of no use for us to
   kick against the pricks. The Divine appointment will certainly be
   fulfilled and the misery to us will be in struggling against the yoke,
   in endeavoring to have it otherwise than Divine love and infinite
   wisdom have determined it should be!

   If you cannot change your place, change your mind till your mind shall
   take to your place and you shall love it! Why, there have been men so
   helped of God to conquer self that they have hugged their crosses! I
   think it is Rutherford who somewhere says that he was half afraid lest
   he should begin to love his cross better than Christ. That is a fear
   which will seldom need to cross our minds, but, oh, we ought to be
   perfectly satisfied, perfectly content with that which pleases God! "If
   this is the Lord's will, it is my will"--such a saying comes from a
   happy heart! But if God has one will and we have another, it is clear
   that the peace of God does not yet rule our hearts. Though forgiven and
   though the grand cause of quarrel is gone, yet we are raising minor
   points of difference and these instill strife. It is like a great
   lawsuit that has been decided on all the grand features of the case and
   yet, here is the plaintiff picking little points, raising little
   questions and getting up fresh litigation! The point with us is to say,
   "It is all given up. Whatever You will, Lord, I will; or at least I
   wish to will. I ask for Grace that I may will it because You will it."

   This voluntary submission to our Father's appointment is the peace of
   God. This peace of God is, also, peace such as God commends--such as
   God approves. That, you know, is first, perfect peace with Himself and
   then with all men-- certainly with His people, but also with all
   mankind. "If it is possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably
   with all men." Take heed that you do not offend! And if you are
   offended by others, do not offend in return, but accept the offense in
   patience--forgive it and forget it. Forbear, and when you have done so,
   forbear! And when you have done so again, forbear! And when you have
   forborne seven times, still forbear! I will not repeat the advice 70
   times seven, though if I did, I should not go beyond the measure of
   forbearance and of forgiveness which the Lord Jesus would have us
   display. Be so at peace with God that you feel perfectly at peace with
   your fellow men.

   Whenever I have suffered a grievous wrong, it has been a satisfaction
   to me to feel that, if my Lord Jesus Christ made atonement for my
   offenses and my wrongs, I can look at His Atonement as an atonement for
   the wrong done to me as well as to God, for He satisfied all parties in
   that quarrel. Gladly do I say, "Surely, this poor soul may well be
   forgiven by me, for You have died as the sinners' Substitute." In
   comparison with my own offenses against God, I may well look upon this
   man's offense as less than nothing! What if men should do the worst
   they can do to us? What is it? What if they slay us? It is but a small
   loss to a Christian to die! Therefore let us harbor no malice, but
   feel, "No, we have entered into the truce of God and we are the friends
   of every man that breathes." For my own part, I have a crusade against
   the devil and all evil, but the truce of God is upon me with regard to
   all my fellow men and, from now on, that peace which was proclaimed at
   Bethlehem by the angels shall stand for me-- "Peace on earth: good will
   toward men." This is a sweet part of the peace of God! Cultivate it
   carefully.

   But this peace is called the peace of God because it is peace which God
   works in the soul. I think I hear you exclaim, "To have such a peace as
   that--a perfect consciousness of full forgiveness, complete
   acquiescence in the will of God, perfect forgiveness towards all
   mankind and an intense desire to live in perfect peace with all, both
   saints and sinners--how can I get such a peace within me?" Ah, indeed,
   how can you? It is impossible to unrenewed human nature! Man, by
   nature, is worse than any wild beast, for he is a menagerie. There is
   lion in him and there is serpent in him. There is tiger in

   him and there is wolf in him. There is dog in him and there is devil in
   him. He is half beast and half devil through the Fall. I do not
   caricature him--his body allies him to the beast and sin makes him a
   child of Satan!

   Mr. Whitefield used to describe fallen nature and he was pretty near
   the mark. "How shall this wild beast be taught to love? Shall the lion
   eat straw like an ox? It never will till it leaves off being a lion. It
   cannot do so--it has not fit teeth for eating straw, nor a fit stomach
   for digesting grass. It cannot live on straw, like an ox, till God
   changes it and gives it an ox-like nature." So it is with us--we need a
   new nature before we can possess this peace with God. But how is that
   to be done? Shall the Ethiopian change his skin? No. He cannot do that.
   And if he could, it would not equal the miracle which we require. Our
   default is not skin deep, only, it is much more than that. Changing
   skins is difficult, but changing hearts is impossible except to God.
   Shall the leopard get rid of his spots? Well, that is difficult, but
   still, the task of taking spots out of leopards would be small compared
   with the miracle of taking evil out of the very core of our wild
   beastlike heart and putting into it the peace of God that makes us
   love. Only God can do it!

   God's own mighty Spirit must put forth that same energy with which He
   will raise the dead out of their graves at the Resurrection--for
   nothing short of creation and Resurrection power is able to transmute
   this beastly, devilish heart of ours into a heart in which the peace of
   God shall reign supreme! Well is it called the peace of God! My dear
   Hearer, do you know this peace? If so, you will understand that because
   of its excellence, it is called the peace of God. It is a Hebraism, for
   among the Hebrews they called certain mountains that were higher than
   others the hills of God--and certain gigantic trees, such as the cedars
   of Lebanon, were the trees of God that were full of sap. So the peace
   that is greater than every other peace is called the peace of God--it
   means the holiest, deepest peace. It is "perfect peace"--peace that
   nothing disturbs. It is a deep peace--"the peace of God, which passes
   all understanding"--solemn peace at which you almost stand in awe! It
   is a hush within the soul in which there is heard nothing of discord or
   of fear, but a stillness reigns like that which was maintained in the
   Holy of Holies, within the veil, where seraphim were silent above the
   Mercy Seat.

   "The peace of God" signifies the peace that never ends, everlasting
   peace--the peace that will live with us throughout the whole of our
   mortal sojourn till we come into the land of the immortal!--

   "There shall I bathe my weary soul In seas of heavenly rest, And not a
   wave of trouble roll

   Across my peaceful breast."

   "The peace of God." Oh, I have known it! You, too, my Brothers and
   Sisters, must have known it when the Lord, Himself, has dwelt within
   your hearts and kept all adversaries far away. You have then known days
   of Heaven upon the earth. It has left nothing to wish for except the
   perpetuation of itself, for you have been satisfied with favor and full
   of the goodness of the Lord--filled with all the fullness of God,
   anchored fast, settled, grounded, established!--

   "My heart is resting,

   my God!

   1 will give thanks and sing. My heart is at the secret source Of every
   precious thing."

   That is the peace of God! Win it, dear Friends, and wear it! By God's
   good Spirit enter into this serene haven. Rest in the Lord and be happy
   in Him, for He is our peace! When the Lord and Giver of peace once
   comes to tarry in your heart, let Him rest there and charge all about
   you, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that they stir not up
   nor awake your Love until He pleases.

   II. But now let us consider the second piece of advice that grows out
   of the text. If you possess this peace of God, let it

   occupy the throne--LET THE PEACE OF GOD RULE IN YOUR HEARTS. In order
   to there being any peace in the

   heart, or anywhere else, there must be a ruler. Those people who are
   for putting down all kings and principalities and powers may bid
   farewell to peace. Anybody who is inclined to anarchy should read
   Carlyle's, "French Revolution," with care and ask himself whether the
   worst king is not, after all, a great deal better than the despotism of
   the mob--the carnival of misrule wherein every man does that which is
   right in his own eyes--all eyes love darkness rather than light.

   Let loose the reins of government, let everybody be equal to everybody
   else--and a little bigger than everybody else as well--and you will
   soon see what confusion ensues! See how it is in a house! I hear that
   there was great deliberation over those census papers, in many
   families, to know who was the head of the household. But I am quite
   clear that it was

   not a happy household where that question took long to answer, for the
   husband is the head of the wife and where he is not so, everything is
   out of order--monstrous and outrageous. Where the head is not the head,
   the hand is not the hand, the eye is not the eye, the heart is not the
   heart--and nothing is itself at all! All is what it should not be and
   all is misery. You must have a governing faculty somewhere and, within
   your own soul, if nothing governs, I tell you boldly, the devil
   governs! That man who does not control himself is controlled by the
   devil, for he must have a master somewhere.

   We cannot have two masters, but it is quite as certain that we must
   have one! One power or another will master you. Shall it be your
   Creator, or His enemy? Your Savior, or your destroyer? It is a blessed
   gift of Grace if a man is enabled by the Holy Spirit to say--"The peace
   of God shall rule in my heart." Paul advised this--"Let the peace of
   God rule in your hearts." If it is in your hearts at all, it must rule,
   for it has power to put down all rebellion. You know, when we have a
   government and a magistracy with power at their back, if a riot arises,
   we appeal to the lawful power to come and protect us and put down the
   uproar. So in our hearts, if we have a master principle and that master
   principle is the peace of God, we may, with confidence, pray, "O Lord,
   put down this riot. I am tossed to and fro in my heart about my
   circumstances. I do not like them and I quarrel with You about them.
   Come, peace of God! Come and put down my murmuring! Come and calm my
   wicked, discontented spirit."

   Or do I feel some discord in my spirit towards one whom I ought to
   love? I must cry, "Come, peace of God. Come, and arrest this bad temper
   of mine! Handcuff it. Take it off to prison. Give it hard labor and
   short commons! Bring it down till it is no longer able to rebel as it
   does. Come, peace of God, and help me in the struggles of my daily
   life, that I may not break out into anger, wrath, malice and all
   uncharitableness. Come, peace of God, put forth Your mighty power over
   my soul." This is the great remedy for the discord within and the
   discords without--the grand cure for all distempers of the east wind
   and all besides. Yield yourself to the control of the blessed peace of
   God, for I find that the Greek word has that force--"Let the peace of
   God umpire in your hearts."

   You know the umpire in the Greek games decided how the runners should
   run; how the wrestlers should wrestle and he ruled a contest to be, or
   not to be, according to the law of the festival. He said, perhaps, that
   such-and-such a blow in the fight was a foul blow, and if he said so,
   there was no questioning him--it was decided. He stood at the finish
   line when the runners came in and he declared a certain swift-footed
   racer to be the winner. No man ever questioned the dictate of the
   umpire! His voice ended all debate. He was the man who decided in the
   games and whose verdict was never to be disputed.

   Now, the peace of God is to do the same in our hearts. We ought to be
   resolved to judge all things by the peace of God. "What ought I to do
   in this case? Must I humble myself? I do not like it, but how ought I
   to act? Shall I yield?" Pride says, "Never! No, no! Play the man. Never
   give in!" But what does the peace of God say? It says, "Yield. Submit."
   Christ says, "I say unto you, that you resist not evil: but whoever
   shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other, also. And
   if any man will sue you at the Law, and take away your coat, let him
   have your cloak, also." Christ decides that it will be good to be a
   sufferer rather than to take revenge. We ought to have the peace of God
   ruling in our hearts so as to let it decide our course and lead us to
   do that which is consistent with our own peace with God.

   I do not know how you find it, but I know that I cannot afford to be
   angry. It takes so much that is valuable out of me. I am sure it does.
   It does a man, physically, an immense mischief. To some men it is a
   dangerous thing to get excited, it even endangers their lives. But,
   spiritually, I believe that to get into a state of enmity towards
   anybody is one of the most grievous diseases which can befall a
   Christian! In such a case you cannot pray as you did. You cannot read
   some passages of Scripture as you did. You cannot look the Well-Beloved
   in the face, and say, "I am acting in a way that pleases You." It is,
   therefore, a very serious thing for a Believer in the Lord Jesus Christ
   to break his own peace--serious to himself as well as to those that are
   round about him.

   I pray you, therefore, dear Friends, let the peace of God decide for
   you in all trials of temper, enduring of wrongs and questions which
   lead to debate and separation. Set Peace in the chariot and let it hold
   the reins, for anger will, like Phaeton of old, set the world on fire.
   Oh, Peace of God, rule me! Pray God that the power of this peace may be
   constantly upon you. If you lose your peace with God, you lose your
   power to judge under difficulties. You lose your power of self-control
   under provocations. You lose the best sovereign that ever held a
   scepter! I believe that if a man is walking with God in the Light of
   God and enjoying full fellowship with Heaven, he may go down into any
   meeting, however tur-

   bulent--into any society, however discordant the elements may be--and
   yet he will be wise to answer, wise to be silent, wise to do, or wise
   not to do--for the peace of God will keep him calm and quiet.

   Once let the mind be thoroughly disturbed and unhinged before the
   Lord--and you are weak as any other man and you will say that which you
   will have to unsay--and you will do that which you would wish to wipe
   out with your tears! When rest of soul is gone, hard things are spoken
   and hard things are done which would not consort with communion with
   the tender Lord. Let the peace of God always rule, or otherwise you
   will not always be safe. Especially let the peace of God rule your
   affections! Be satisfied that you love God and that your heart cleaves
   to God and does not follow after any other. Be at peace with God as to
   your heart and, when that is so, and the affections are dominated by
   conscious love to God, it is then that you fight the battles of life
   with comfort to yourself and with honor to the name of Him to whom you
   belong.

   III. Very briefly, I want, in the third place, to say, STRENGTHEN
   YOURSELF, dear Friends, BY GOD'S SPIRIT,

   WITH ARGUMENTS, in order that you may let the peace of God rule in your
   hearts and may be kept from any breach of that heavenly peace.
   Remember, you can only be happy in heart and healthy in spirit as long
   as you keep the peace of God. You are sure to become wretched and
   unhappy--you are sure to stumble, here and there, into faults--if that
   peace of God is gone. As you would be in the best possible condition
   for walking with God in joy while here, below, look to your peace. This
   is no mean argument--try to feel the force of it.

   And, next, only thus can the Church of God prosper. I am grieved when I
   receive members from other Churches who come because they say that they
   are weary of the incessant bickering and jealousies which have
   disturbed their rest. I am sure that there can be no blessing where
   there is no peace. A house divided against itself cannot stand. A
   Church disputing is a Church committing suicide! Many and many a Church
   has come to its death by bleeding inwardly through strife--otherwise it
   might have defied the whole world and Hell itself! It is generally the
   little Churches that squabble most--if they cannot excel in anything
   else, they certainly claim the first rank in quarrelling. A few
   Christian people get together to serve God and the devil comes in, at
   once, and sets them by the ears--they are good men and true--but Satan
   bewitches them so that they dispute about nothing at all.

   Whenever I have to settle a dispute, I always like to have some big,
   bad thing in it. This I can point out and we soon agree to set the
   matter right. When I cannot, with a microscopes on my eyes, find out
   what it is all about, I find that Brothers and Sisters are hardest to
   be reconciled. It is easier to shoot an owl than a gnat! Little
   differences rankle like tiny thorns and you cannot get them out of the
   flesh. Oh, that the Spirit of God would come upon the Churches and turn
   them into masses of fire! Then they would not fall to pieces through
   intestine strife! When souls are being won; when the Gospel is being
   enjoyed; when Christ is being glorified; when the Church is marching
   on, conquering and to conquer through the Divine power that is in her,
   then is there peace within her borders and her citizens are filled with
   the finest of the wheat! But once let the life of God run low and let
   the Spirit of God depart, then peace departs, too. Oh, may God save
   this Church and save all the Churches from missing this blessed peace!
   Let the peace of God rule in your heart, dear Brother, dear Sister, for
   the Church's sake.

   Remember, next, that God cannot be glorified unless there is the peace
   of God in our hearts. My dear Friend, if you are always troubled and
   fretting and anxious, I do not see how you can glorify God to any large
   extent. Seek more faith, more trust, more confidence, more calm of mind
   and you will personally glorify God. I am sure a Christian man who
   always finds fault with everybody is of little service to the cause and
   kingdom of our Lord. He who, wherever he goes, acts like a carrion crow
   that soars aloft with no other design than finding out where a carcass
   may be, that he may light upon it--he, I say, is not a man after God's
   own heart--and neither will he advance the Lord's work among men! When
   you love your fellow Christians so that their faults are covered by
   your charity and you rather admire their excellences than publish their
   infirmities, then it is that God is glorified by you! A happy, peaceful
   people of whom men can say, "See how these Christians love one
   another"--these shine as lights in the world and the darkness feels
   their power!

   The passage from which our text is taken offers us other reasons. It
   says this--"To which you are also called." You were called to the peace
   of God. My dear Brother, if you are not a peaceful man, you have not
   inherited your true calling. When the Lord called you out from the
   world, He called you to be a peacemaker. He called you on purpose, that
   the Spirit of peace might be shed abroad in your heart and that
   afterwards you might carry that peace with you into your own family and
   among all your neighbors and spread it everywhere. The Lord Jesus never
   called a man to be a maker of

   strife! If a Christian woman, as she calls herself, goes from house to
   house with tittle-tattle, she was not called by God to do so--of that I
   am certain!

   A man goes into his pulpit and preaches a personal sermon on purpose to
   empty out his own spleen--God did not call him to that, for God loves
   not firebrands! The man may have been sent as a messenger from other
   regions, but certainly not as an ambassador from Heaven, when he
   preaches gall and wormwood. Some seem, wherever they go, to make
   mischief as speedily as possible--their mission is contention,
   whereunto they certainly were not called of God! You who are the true
   heirs of Heaven are called to peace--seek peace and pursue it. Wherever
   you go, labor earnestly to make peace. If you see two boys fighting,
   make them stop. If you see two girls in a bad temper, try to make them
   happy with one another. If you see two people disagree in business, do
   not back one of them up, and cry, "Go to the law with him," but plead
   for peace and mutual concession. "Blessed are the peacemakers."

   Whatever you may be in a household, whether father or child, husband or
   wife, master or servant, son-in-law or mother-in-law, let your soul be
   seasoned and savored with that blessed word, "Peace." There is always a
   war party in England--I fear the Jingo is no foreigner, but the genuine
   offspring of the British bulldog! An unconverted British is all for
   blood, fire and glory--and as the unconverted are the majority among
   us--we remain a fighting nation. Fighting-- how we delight in it! Down
   with the Afghans, down with the Zulus! The Boers? Destroy them! We
   cannot get our fill of glory and honor unless we get knee deep in
   blood! The policy of peace is voted dishonorable and so we go from land
   to land till there is hardly a nation which has not been stained with
   blood by British hands. How fiercely these English talk--but it is not
   Christian talk! May the Lord teach us the language of peace.

   Be you at peace, "whereunto also you were called." And then, notice
   next, "Called in one body." There must, therefore, be peace among
   Christians because we are called in one body to peace. What would you
   think of my hand, if it should say, "I will have no peace with the eye.
   That prying eye looked sharply at me the other day and spied out a
   spot. I will put it out"? We shall not enjoy much prosperity if the
   members of the body thus disagree. Suppose my foot should say, "I am
   not going to carry that heavy body about. See what I have to suffer
   through it at times." Suppose my knee should say, "I will not have it.
   I have been tortured quite enough with rheumatism--I will no longer
   carry that heavy fabric." What will become of me if the members of my
   body thus fall to quarrelling? And what is to become of the Glory of
   Christ if His members live in contention? What is the Head to do if the
   members who make up His one mystical body have nothing to do but to be
   striving, one against the other?

   Oh, no! If you have any differences, end them tonight, I pray you, if
   you can, even though the east wind is so piercing! If you have
   unwittingly done anything that grieves others, try to remedy it. Or if
   others have grieved you, end the matter by sweet and swift forgiveness.
   Let it be all ended with the east wind! We are called in one body,
   therefore let us dwell in hearty peace and may God the Holy Spirit, the
   Lord and Giver of peace, bring us into the peace of God and keep us
   there, for thereunto we are called in one body.

   IV. The last point upon which I shall speak is this--to keep yourselves
   right, OCCUPY YOUR MINDS HEALTHILY. "How?" you ask. The text says, "Be
   you thankful." That is the way to keep up our peace with God! "Be
   thankful." Do not complain, but bless His name for everything! Do not
   quarrel with Him, but be thankful. Say, "Shall we receive good at the
   hands of the Lord, and shall we not receive evil? The Lord gave, and
   the Lord has taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." That is
   the way to be at peace with Him--to be thankful at all times. Bless God
   for your mercies and for your miseries! Bless Him for your gains and
   for your losses! Bless Him for your enjoyments and pleasures, and also
   for your aches and pains! Bless Him for every hard thing that comes
   from Him, for there is as much love in the hard as in the soft--God is
   as kind when He uses the rod as when He gives a kiss. "Be you
   thankful!" Bless Him from morning to night and all through the night
   watches. What a mercy to be out of the hospital! What a mercy to have
   the use of one's limbs and reasoning powers! What a mercy to be out of
   prison! What a mercy to be out of Hell! "He has not dealt with us after
   our sins." Be thankful!

   Last Sunday morning, when I read this chapter in the great
   congregation, I tried to ring it out as loudly as ever I could, and I
   would like to ring it out as with a whole peal of bells now. Set them
   all ringing a marriage-peal, if you like-- "Be you thankful! Be you
   thankful! Be you thankful!" Up, you murmuring! Up, you discontented!
   "Be you thankful." Rouse yourselves, you sullen ones! You that think
   you have a heavier load to carry than is fair and say, like Cain, "My
   burden is greater than I can bear"--"Be you thankful!" All of you,
   young and old, "Be you thankful." That

   is the way to keep up your pence with God and your peace with your
   fellow men! Well, but it does not mean only, "Be thankful to God," but
   be you thankful to your fellow men.

   Too many receive all kinds of Christian kindness as a matter of course.
   They look upon the spontaneous kindness of their Brethren as a sort of
   right. Now, that the poor should be helped by Christian generosity is
   certainly according to Scripture--but this is an obligation not of debt
   but of Grace. Whatever is done in almsgiving and charity should be
   gratefully and heartily received. It is an unholy spirit which scarcely
   has the courtesy to say, "thank you." Towards one another we ought to
   have a thankful spirit. How thankful the child ought to be to his
   mother and his father! What a happy home we should have if children
   recognized the deep debt of obligation that is really due to those who
   have nursed them and cared for them so long! How obliged, I think, the
   husband ought to be to his wife for all her tender kind-nesses--those
   hundred unseen ministries of love!

   How grateful, I think, the wife should be to her husband, for all his
   labors and anxieties! She receives a thousand things from him which
   make life comfortable. If we live in mutual gratitude, feeling that we
   are, each one of us, indebted to all others, how merrily will the
   household wheels go round and what families of love we shall all gather
   around us! I, of all the people in the world, am most in debt to
   everybody--and I feel it deeply and truly. There is hardly a person
   that I look upon from this pulpit but I owe something to his or her
   Christian love. Everybody has been kind to me and I am not unmindful of
   it. When I have lain upon my bed, sick and ill, I have marveled at the
   kindness of you all! I wonder why you treat me so lovingly! In all holy
   work, whether it is the College or Orphanage, you have been my ready
   helpers and you still are. I cannot help saying, "God bless you."

   Surely the wind is changing a point or two--we shall find it blowing
   from another quarter when we leave this Tabernacle! I feel intense
   gratitude in my soul towards the dear Brothers who surround me and the
   Sisters that work with me for Christ. You have often made me happy and
   cheered my spirit by the kind and generous way in which you have worked
   with me for the Lord, bearing with all my infirmities. And I believe
   that it is because I feel thankful that I feel peaceful and so remain
   the center of your unity. I am not inclined to quarrel with anybody--I
   would sooner run a mile than I would fight for half a minute! There is
   nobody in the world that I would like to contend with--my heart is full
   of good wishes to all men! It has been a sort of rule with me to
   measure a man before I fight him--if he is bigger than I am, I know he
   will beat me, so I decline battle! And if he is smaller and I can
   easily beat him, it would be cruel and cowardly to do so.

   Nobody in the world is worth contending against as to our temporal
   interests. Even the necessary law is troublesome and vexatious. Be you
   thankful, then, and if, with thankfulness to God and thankfulness to
   those around you, you can fill up the day, oh, how happy will the days
   be! In the family and in the business, God will be glorified, the
   Church will be sweetened and welded together--we shall see better times
   and shall no longer grumble at the east wind! May God bless you!

The Use of the Bow

   (No. 1694)

   DELIVERED AT THE THURSDAY EVENING LECTURE,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan
   his son: (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
   bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher)." 2 Samuel 1:17,18

   THE translators have acted very properly in inserting the words, "the
   use of," for that is what the passage means. But if you read it without
   those words, the sense is still the same-- "He bade them teach the
   children of Judah the bow," that is to say, how to use the bow. In
   modern times, critics have said that by the expression, "the bow," is
   meant the song which David composed. And to sustain their notion, they
   quote from the Koran of Mahomet in which they tell us that there is a
   certain chapter called, "the Bow," and, therefore, David called his
   song, "the bow," as if so late an instance of oriental usage was at all
   to the point. I declare that there is nothing whatever in Scripture to
   justify the statement that the words, "the bow," can be applied to
   David's lament!

   No doubt, some of the Psalms have titles given to them, but there is
   never an instance of a Psalm being quoted by its title. It is quoted by
   its number, never by its name. I accept the passage as our learned
   translators understood it--David bade them teach the children of Judah
   the bow. If any enquire, "What, then, is the connection? Why should
   David teach the people the use of the bow because Saul and Jonathan
   were slain? Why is the military order concerning the use of a certain
   instrument of war inserted here, when the passage is full of
   lamentation?" If any ask, I say, I answer most fitly, as I shall have
   to show you--it was the best memorial of that skillful archer,
   Jonathan, and of the other princes who had fallen by the arrows of the
   Philistines, that from the disastrous day of their slaughter, David
   caused his own tribe, over which he had chief power, to be trained in
   the use of that special weapon of war.

   I. But now to our work. From my text I want to gather a few useful
   lessons. And the first is this--ACTIVITY IS A VALUABLE SOLACE FOR
   SORROW. The people were very grieved, for Saul and Jonathan, the king
   and the crown prince, were slain. David indulges their grief--he writes
   them a plaintive song which the daughters of Israel may sing. But to
   take their minds off their distress, he, at the same time, issues the
   order to teach the children of Judah the use of the bow--for activity
   is an effectual remedy in the time of sorrow. Certainly the opposite of
   it would tend towards blank despair. Are any of you in great grief?
   Have you suffered a supreme loss?

   Do not be tempted to brood over your affliction and to think that you
   ought to be excused from further service! Do not shut yourself up to
   meditate upon the great ill that has befallen you, so as to nurse your
   wrath against God. This can do you no good whatever! Rather imitate
   David, who, when his child was sick, fasted and prayed, but when it was
   dead, went into the house and ate bread, for he said, "Can I bring him
   back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me." I
   beseech you do not fall under the temptation of Satan to cease from
   your daily activity--and especially from any holy service in which you
   are engaged for Christ.

   It may be that your sorrow is not a bereavement, but disappointment in
   your work. You have not won those souls that you looked to win and,
   some that you thought were converted, have gone back. And now Satan
   tempts you to do no more--never to cast the net again, for you have
   toiled all night and taken nothing--never to sow again, for you have
   wasted your seed by the highway, and birds have devoured it. This is a
   suggestion of the Evil One. It will lead you into deeper anguish. I
   would say to you, O mourner, get up from the couch of ease! Shake
   yourself from the dust, O virgin daughter of Zion! Sit not down upon
   the dunghill in your grief, but bestir yourself, lest you sink into
   blacker woe and your bitterness become as wormwood and gall! While
   inaction will lead into blank despair, I am certain that work distracts
   the mind from the sad point upon which it is apt to thrust itself.

   Nothing is more healthy than to have work to do. I have seen persons of
   leisure give way, most terribly, in the case of the loss of children.
   While I have known laboring people, who, I believe, have been as
   sensitive in heart, who have kept up bravely. Under God, I have
   attributed the difference to the fact that the poor woman must go to
   earn her daily bread, or must get about her domestic duties whatever
   happens, and the poor man must do his daily task, or else the family
   will be in need. Thus, toil has proved to be a blessed necessity by
   withdrawing the mind from the sorrow which would have engrossed it. You
   have heard of Alexander Cruden. Perhaps you do not know that he was
   crossed in love and met with certain other trials which drove him
   nearly mad--and yet Alexander Cruden did not become insane, for he
   engaged upon the immense work of forming a concordance of sacred
   Scripture--which concordance has become the great instrument by which
   we search the Word of God. This work kept him from becoming altogether
   insane. If I had to prescribe to "a mind diseased," I would say, "Enter
   upon good work and keep at it."

   Dear Friends, if you are in trouble and Satan tempts you to get alone
   and to cease from the work of the Lord, resist the injurious
   suggestion! God the Holy Spirit is most likely to comfort you and to
   apply the precious promises of His Word to your soul if you pursue your
   Master's work with all your heart. Attend to His business and He will
   attend to your business! Tell poor sinners about His wounds and He will
   bind up yours. Forget your cross in His! Forget your griefs in the
   griefs of the sons of men who are perishing for lack of knowledge--and
   you shall find the readiest way to consolation. A valuable solace for
   sorrow is activity, especially, I think, in reference to new work. It
   will help you much if a new trouble suggests to you new service. Old
   work does not always take the mind off from its vexatious, for we are
   apt to do it mechanically and as a matter of routine. But something
   altogether fresh will aid us sweetly to forget our trial.

   Oh, to strike out some new path! To invent new honors for Jesus, new
   enterprises for His Kingdom, new attractions for His Gospel--this will
   help to charm away our grief! With many, the doing of any kind of
   service for Christ will be quite a novelty. I grieve to say it. These
   people are desponding. I am not so grieved at that, because if any man
   will not work, neither shall he eat. And if a Christian will not serve
   his Master, he shall not feast with the King's worthies. Oh, how much
   of joy many of you miss by not doing more for the poor, more for the
   ignorant, more for Christ!

   The poet, Rogers, tells us and he throws the story into poetry which I
   forget--of a rich man in Venice who was the subject of despair. He
   became such a hypochondriac that he went down to the canal to drown
   himself. But on the way he was met by a poor little boy who tugged at
   his trousers and begged for bread. When the rich man called him an
   impostor, the boy besought him to come home with him and see his father
   and mother who were dying of starvation. He went up into the room and
   found the family literally perishing for lack of food! He immediately
   laid out the money which he had in his pocket in making them all glad
   with a hearty meal. And then he said to himself that there was
   something worth living for, after all. He had found a novel enjoyment
   which gave a fresh motive for living!

   I would like to ask you who have suffered a great trouble whether the
   Lord may not be pressing you, by this means, into a new path of
   delight, directing you to a fresh method of glorifying God and doing
   good to your fellow men? I will sing you a song if you will, as
   sorrowful as David's lament, but I would rather teach you the use of
   the bow! I believe that I shall minister better to your comfort if I
   enlist you as soldiers in Christ's army and teach you to use His
   weapons, than if I should console you with the most plaintive
   minstrelsy of sadness. Do I speak to any here present who endure great
   earthly afflictions, but know nothing of spiritual things? Is it not
   the case that God often brings His wandering children to Himself by
   distresses? The way in which you are to be comforted, dear Friends, is
   not by going into the world, again, and seeking further pleasures
   there.

   If God means to bless you, He may allow you to become so hungry that
   you may wish to fill your belly with the husks. You have spent your
   living riotously and now you are ready to despair. Round by that dark
   corner of despair may be the way to your Father's house! To expel your
   present temporal grief, you need a spiritual grief concerning sin. If
   you learn of Jesus at this hour to repent of sin and to put your trust
   in Him, your soul will be awakened to say, "I will arise and go unto my
   Father," and then you will lose your hunger and forget the swine
   trough! Where? Why, amidst the music and dancing of your Father's house
   and in the joy of hearing Him say, "Let us eat and be merry, for this,
   My son was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found."

   Yes, David was right. The way to raise the people out of their
   despondency was to teach them the use of the bow-- their own arrows
   would slay their grief--and the way to get you mourning ones out of
   your sorrow is to teach you those

   holy activities which lead a soul to trust in Christ and to find
   salvation at His feet. That is the first lesson which, I think, the
   text most sweetly teaches.

   II. A second lesson is that AN ADMIRABLE USE OF DISASTER IS TO LEARN
   ITS LESSONS. What was the disaster? Saul and Jonathan had been shot by
   archers. The Philistines were evidently strong in the use of the bow,
   but Saul's army was short of archers and so they were not able to
   strike the Philistines at a distance. Before they came to close
   quarters, where Israel might have been a match for Philistia, the
   arrows of the Philistines had reached their king. Had they known how to
   use the bow, they might have been conquerors and, therefore, David
   hastens to teach the men of Judah the use of the bow.

   Beloved Friends, I will suppose that you have met with failures--I
   refer to disasters peculiar to yourselves. What shall you do? Sit down
   and fret and trouble yourselves, and give up in despair? God forbid! As
   the men of Judah learned the use of the bow through their being beaten
   by the bow, so you gather wisdom from that which has befallen you! Have
   you been made to fly before your adversary? Then find out where your
   weakness is. Search and see. Is it a sin indulged? Is it some point
   where you ought to have been guarded, but where you have been
   unwatchful? Is it weakness in prayer? Is it neglect of the Word of God?
   Is it indifference to Divine Truths of God? Is it coldness of heart? Or
   what is it? If you have been defeated, there is a cause for it. If you
   have been cast down and brought low, say unto God, "Show me why You
   contend with me."

   Has the Lord a controversy with you? Be not content till you have got
   to the bottom of it and found out the root that bears this gall and
   wormwood. Is not this the way of wisdom? May it not happen that the
   cause of the disaster is that God is not with you? What if nothing
   prospers with you? What if it is vain for you to rise up early, sit up
   late and eat the bread of carefulness, since the hand of God is against
   you? What if you are to have no pleasure in the things that once gave
   you satisfaction because God has set you as a target for His
   arrows--and in wrath is shooting at you? It may be so. Or you may not
   be one of His children at all, as yet, and He may be tossing you to and
   fro like a ball, that you may never find rest until you humbly come and
   cry to Christ and seek mercy at His hands. Look and see whether it is
   so!

   It is of no use to worry about the disaster--search out the cause of
   it. Strive to learn the lesson which it is meant to teach you. Is there
   any secret sin with you? Perhaps by looking at the defeat you may learn
   the way to victory. David judged that if they were defeated by the bow,
   they might yet win by the bow. It is right to learn from our
   adversaries. There is something to be learned from Satan. If he goes
   about, let us be diligent. If he seeks whom he may devour, let us seek
   whom we may save! And if he watches carefully to find out our weak
   points, let us watch those whom we would bless to find out how we may
   best reach their hearts. Many a man has grown rich through poverty,
   healthy through sickness and holy by being made conscious of sin! When
   he has been struck down, then has he cried out to God, and God has
   lifted him up. Woe to that man who will not "hear the rod, and Him that
   has appointed it." I pray that you may diligently learn the lesson
   which every disaster would teach.

   May not a misfortune which happens to a Church and to Christian people
   be, to them, a call to action--to general action? Saul had a little
   standing army and did not drill all the nation for war. But David says,
   "I will teach all my own tribe the use of the bow." Now, whenever a
   Church begins to get low, dull, stupid--and many Churches go in that
   direction--when everybody seems to be asleep and the minister's sermon
   is a kind of sanctified snore, and all the worship is steeped in
   slumber, why, what is to be done? Then is the time to teach the
   children of Judah the use of the bow and to wake them all up to holy
   enterprise! Say to them, "You must not allow a few to be doing the work
   of Christ, but all must do it! You must all be taught the use of the
   bow."

   It was the glory of the Moravians that all their members were
   missionaries and such ought to be the glory of every Church--every man,
   woman and child in the Church should take part in the battle for Jesus.
   This, by God's Grace, is the cure for spiritual decline--teach the
   people the use of the bow! Let us learn lessons from defeat. Let us
   learn from the sin which has cast us down to cry unto God, the Mighty
   One, to hold us up! If we are, at this time, under some great failure
   in life, let us learn greater care. If we have been permitted to err,
   let us learn to watch. Do not sullenly confess, "I have done wrong,"
   but repent of it and ask God for Grace that you may be upheld in the
   future, like Peter, who was stronger after his fall than before it, and
   was set to strengthen his Brethren.

   What is done cannot be undone, but we may so learn from it, by God's
   teaching, that we may never do the same again. May God grant that this
   may be the case. If it were proper, I could sing to you tonight a song
   of mourning over

   the disasters of a soul, or of a Church, but I believe that I would not
   do you half as much good as by stirring you up to learn the use of the
   bow, that is to say, to rectify your errors and supply your defects!

   III. Now, thirdly, another lesson. A NOBLE MONUMENT TO A FRIEND IS TO
   IMITATE HIS EXCELLENCES. How does that come from the text? Why, thus.
   When Jonathan and David communed together, they fixed the meeting by
   Jonathan's shooting certain arrows. It is evident that Jonathan was a
   man who greatly favored the use of the bow. And though his father did
   not largely introduce it into the army, yet Jonathan was well skilled
   therein. "Well then," says David, "in memory of Jonathan, instead of
   piling up a great monument, we will teach the children of Judah the use
   of the bow." Come, Brothers and Sisters, let this be your memorial to
   your dear father--if he was a child of God, be like he! If you want to
   keep in memory your beloved mother, exhibit in yourselves the virtues
   that shone in her.

   That sweet child of yours has gone to Heaven and can never be
   forgotten. Her likeness hangs over the mantelpiece. I mean that dear
   little child who sang of Jesus when she died--if you want to remember
   her beyond all forgetfulness, then love her Savior and go where little
   Jane has gone! No memorial is more fit than imitation--be, yourself,
   the monument by exhibiting within yourself all that was good in the
   dear departed one. How specially true is this in connection with our
   Divine Lord! I see the Romanist continually putting up crosses by the
   roadside and, sometimes, on these there are hideous representations of
   a person dying by crucifixion. There are nails, a sponge, a spear and I
   know not what. This arises out of a natural desire to perpetuate the
   memory of the crucified Redeemer--but you will do far better, dear
   Brother, if you are, yourself, crucified with Christ--and if you
   exhibit in your own person that Divine self-denial, that blessed love,
   that superlative holiness which was found in Him.

   Some will build a Church and lavish money upon architecture. I shall
   not condemn them, for their splendid generosity may savor of the spirit
   of that woman who broke the alabaster box and poured the ointment upon
   the Savior's feet. But I would suggest that to build up within one's
   self, by the power of God's Spirit, the Christ-like character is a
   better memorial than the best piece of architecture that can ever be
   put together! What if you should employ the greatest of sculptures and
   he, with cunning hands, should mold the marble till it emulated life?
   Would not the monument mainly keep in mind the artist and rather make
   men think of the costliness of the work than of anything else? Whereas,
   if you become, yourself, not in marble, but in living flesh, the image
   of Christ, then men will take notice of you--that you have been with
   Jesus and have learned of Him--and this will keep Him best in memory.
   If we do what Christ would have done under our circumstances, we shall
   be exhibiting a far better memorial of Him than wealth can possibly
   purchase.

   When David taught these people the use of the bow, every time they
   stringed an arrow they might remember Jonathan! And whenever a regiment
   of archers went through the streets to the battle, they brought
   Jonathan before the public mind. David instituted this form of royal
   artillery, on purpose, so that Jonathan might be kept in mind. And you,
   dear Friends, every time you go forth to do the service of God,
   obediently and zealously, as Jesus did it, you put men in mind of Jesus
   and they say, "God has set these men in the world to be witnesses for
   Christ, to keep His name alive in the earth. These men are a blessing
   because Jesus, Himself, has blessed them."

   I would thus stir you all up to endeavor all the days of your life to
   live and serve God, that the name of Jesus Christ shall be kept alive
   in this nation and throughout the world!

   IV. Lastly, and but for a moment, I think that the form which this
   military order took, to teach the children of Judah the use of the bow,
   may be allegorically applied, tonight to you, dear Friends. IT IS A
   GREAT ADVANTAGE TO BELIEVERS TO LEARN THE USE OF THE BOW, SPIRITUALLY.
   First, there is the bow of prayer. Its use has not gone out of date,
   but I wish that all of us knew how to shoot the arrows of the Lord's
   deliverance much better than we do. Holy men of old would pick out an
   arrow and when they had chosen it, they knew how to use it. They knew
   what they needed and they prayed for it. They fitted their arrow on the
   string--that is to say, they took God's promise, the promise that
   answered their desire--and, fitting the one to the other, they took
   straight aim at Heaven and watched the flight of the arrow petition!
   They knew to whom they were praying, as well as what they were praying
   for, and why they expected to be heard--and so they drew the bow of
   prayer with all their might.

   When the man of God went up to the top of Carmel and there took his bow
   and drew it, there was no fear of his missing the mark. Or if, perhaps,
   the arrow had not force enough, he would pull the bow a second time,
   and a third time, and a fourth time, and a seventh time, till, at last,
   the arrow struck the mark. He would not come down from his watchtower
   till he knew that the arrow of his prayer was lodged in Heaven! In all
   times of tribulation, what is needed is that the children of Judah
   should know the use of the bow of prayer. When we heard of those
   fearful assassinations in Ireland, the news reached the bulk of us on
   the Lord's Day, and men of God went to their loopholes of retreat and
   shot up to Heaven prayers for poor Ireland! It was the best thing that
   could be done.

   I have more faith in prayer than in police and prisons. In any time of
   national need, the men that save a nation are the men of prayer! What?
   Not the wise statesmen? Certainly, wise statesmen--but who makes them
   wise? God has power over all minds and, in answer to the prayer from
   this pulpit, He can visit yonder mind in St. Stephen's! From a humble
   cottage in the western highlands, there may go up to God a cry that
   shall come down upon the Prime Minister and direct his thoughts!
   Remember what Queen Mary used to say when she tried to bring popery
   back to Scotland? She said that she was more afraid of John Knox's
   prayers than of all the armies that the Scottish lords could get
   together! She was right, for once! When men overlook prayer, they
   overlook the greatest factor in human affairs! The mystic rod of God is
   still in the hand of many a Moses among us--a rod which brings victory
   to Israel and defeat to Amalek.

   The strength of the Church lies not in the oratory of the pulpit, but
   in the oratory of the closet! That Church of God that shall do most for
   the world is the Church that shall do most with God! He can rule men
   for God who is ruled by God for men! He that gives up his soul to God
   that God may write His will upon his life, is the mighty man! The man
   who has had the will of God worked in him by the Holy Spirit and can
   work it out into fervent prayer--he is the man, who, though princes and
   potentates know it not, sits nearer to the helm of affairs than they
   can reach! I could write you a plaintive hymn about the woes of Ireland
   and about the sins of men and the evils of the times, but I had far
   rather teach you the use of the bow of prayer--for then, if you could
   send your longings up to the Lord, full many a blessing would come upon
   the land and the adversaries of the Lord would be discomforted--and
   peaceful and happy days would dawn.

   Perhaps I speak to some here who do not know anything about praying. I
   dare say that the Brother is here who listened to a sermon on Peckham
   Rye, which was rather a wild one, I am afraid. In that discourse the
   preacher said to all his congregation that if they would go home and
   ask God for anything, the Lord would give it to them. I cannot endorse
   so wild a statement! However, this man thought that the preacher,
   having said it, it was true--and having never prayed before in all his
   life, he put the question to the test of a certain event--and that
   certain event fell out as he desired. Then he began to tremble, for he
   judged that, assuredly, there is a God!

   Now, I do not say to you, dear Hearers, that whatever all of you shall
   ask in prayer you shall receive. I would not say that to you ungodly
   ones. But I do say that if you will ask for mercy and salvation and
   eternal life--and anything that is promised to believing sinners--you
   shall have it. I wish you would try the experiment, for you would find
   that the Lord never breaks a promise. If you read a promise made to a
   sinner, it is made to you! Go ahead and plead it, and the Lord will
   grant it. I will be surety for Him that He will keep His word. Trust
   Him and try, and thus learn the use of the bow! God bless you for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

The Orphan's Father

   (No. 1695)

   DELIVERED AT THE THURSDAY EVENING LECTURE,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For in You the fatherless finds mercy." Hosea 14:3.

   THE Lord God of Israel, the one only living and true God, has this for
   a special mark of His Character, that in Him the fatherless finds
   mercy. "A Father of the fatherless, and a Judge of the widows, is God
   in His holy habitation." False gods of the heathen are usually notable
   for their supposed power or cunning, or even for their wickedness,
   falsehood, lustfulness and cruelty. But our God, who made the heavens,
   is the Thrice Holy One. He is the Holy God and He is also full of love.
   Indeed, it is not only His name and His character, but His very Nature,
   for "God is Love." Among the acts which exhibit His love is this--that
   He executes righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed and,
   especially takes under His wings the defenseless ones--such as the
   widow and the fatherless.

   This is very notable if you look into the subject in connection with
   Holy Scripture. We see this soon after the giving of the Law. We have
   the Law in the 20th chapter of Exodus--and in the 22nd chapter of the
   same book, close upon the heels of the Law--you have God's Word
   concerning the fatherless. Listen to Jehovah's words--they are strong
   and forceful--there is a thunder about their sound. "You shall not
   afflict any widow, or fatherless child. If you afflict them in anywise,
   and they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry; and My wrath
   shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall
   be widows, and your children fatherless." These are the words of that
   Jehovah who spoke the Ten Commandments on Sinai! See how very near to
   the heart of our God lies the cause of the widow and the fatherless.

   The Lord gave the Law a second time in the book of Deuteronomy. If you
   turn to the 10th chapter of that book, at the 17th verse, you will find
   such a statute as this--"For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord
   of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not
   persons, nor takes reward: He does execute the judgment of the
   fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and
   raiment." Those are two strong and striking proofs of the fact that the
   cause of the fatherless lies near to the heart of God! Laws were made
   on their behalf and among the rest was the institution of tithes. I
   have read some amazing statements upon the Divine right of tithes. It
   seems to be established in the minds of some that if God gave the
   tithes to Levi, He must, therefore, have given them to Episcopalian
   ministers--an inference which I fail to see! I should just as soon draw
   the inference that He had given them to Baptist ministers! Certainly it
   would be no more illogical! The idea of our being priests, or Levites,
   in order to get compulsory tithes, would be too abhorrent to be
   entertained for a moment! But while I have often seen the Divine right
   of tithes stated and argued, I have never heard it urged that the
   tithes should go to those for whom God set them apart under the legal
   dispensation!

   Now, if you will turn to Scripture, you will find that the tithe of all
   the produce of the land was to be given to the Levite, to the stranger,
   to the widow and to the fatherless--and whenever tithes come to be
   properly distributed, if there is any Divine right in it at all--it
   will most certainly be given to the widow and the fatherless! We should
   agree to its being given, in part, to the Levite when he turns up, but
   as we do not know who the Levite is, at present, we may keep his
   portion in abeyance till he appears! But the widow and the fatherless
   are still here among us! The poor shall never cease out of the
   land--and as the institution of the tithe was as much for them as it
   was for the tribe of Levi, let them have their share!

   The tribe of Levi had certain rights because, while the other tribes
   had, each one, a portion, that tribe had no inheritance and, therefore,
   took out its share in having a part of the tithe and certain cities to
   dwell in. Read Deuteronomy 14:29--"And the Levite, (because he has no
   part nor inheritance with you), and the stranger, and the fatherless,
   and the widow, which are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat
   and be satisfied; that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work
   of your hand which you do." I do not know that Episcopalian clergymen
   have given up their earthly inheri-

   tances any more than Non-Conformist ministers. And I cannot, therefore,
   see that they have the Levite's claim--but I see clearly the right of
   the widow and the fatherless--and I pray that the day may come when
   they will get their share of what is undoubtedly theirs, if it is
   anybody's at all!

   Another ordinance was made about the widow and the fatherless--that
   when the people gathered in the harvest, if they omitted a sheaf of
   corn, they were never to go back for it, but were to leave it for the
   widow and the fatherless. "When you cut down your harvest in your
   field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again
   to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
   the widow: that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your
   hands." In gathering in the corn, the field was not raked, but all that
   fell was left to the widow and the fatherless. It was expressly
   commanded that when they gathered the grapes they were never to gather
   a second time, but were to leave the bunches to be ripened for the
   widow and the fatherless. "When you beat your olive tree, you shall not
   go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the
   fatherless, and for the widow."

   Nobody was forgotten in the Divine rule when Jehovah was King in
   Israel; but special mention was continually being made of these two
   classes--the widow and the fatherless--and the poor strangers that
   happened to be within Israel's gates. "You shall be kind to the
   stranger," said the Lord, "because you were a stranger in the land of
   Egypt, and you know the heart of a stranger." I call your special
   attention to this, and beg you to look through Scripture and see how,
   again and again, God calls upon His people to take care of the widow
   and the fatherless. Job, that upright man whom God accepted, denied for
   himself the charge that he had ever forgotten the widow and the
   fatherless. And you know how, under the New Testament, it is written,
   "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
   visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
   himself unspotted from the world."

   It is established, then, that God, even the God of Israel, is One in
   whom the fatherless finds mercy! Let us take care of them, too. "Be you
   imitators of God as dear children," and select as the objects of your
   charity those whom God specially cares for. This, however, is not my
   subject at this time. I wish you to become, yourselves, objects of the
   Divine charity by coming to God as orphans and putting yourselves under
   His protection, that you, like the fatherless, may find mercy at His
   hands! If we are sad at heart, troubled in spirit, full of needs, full
   of wants and trials, let us be encouraged to come to God because in Him
   the fatherless find mercy! First, here is encouragement. Secondly, here
   is encouragement as to what to do. And, thirdly, here is encouragement
   as to what to expect.

   I. First, here is ENCOURAGEMENT. Here is encouragement, though such as
   none spy out but needy ones. You notice that the people who said, "In
   You the fatherless finds mercy," are the people who had fallen by their
   iniquity and who were bid to return unto the Lord, saying, "Take away
   all iniquity and receive us graciously." They were a people who
   renounced all self-confidence, and cried out, "Ashur shall not save us;
   we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work
   of our hands, you are our gods." They were a people with whom God's
   Holy Spirit had so dealt that they were stripped of their pride and
   made conscious of their guilt. Then it was that they spied out this
   precious fact, that in God the fatherless finds mercy!

   A tear in the eye is a fine thing to clear it. He that never saw his
   sin has never seen the mercy of God. David never sang of the loving
   kindness and tender mercies of God so well as in that 51st Psalm, when
   he mourned his great sin. A broken-hearted sinner has a sort of
   instinct for finding out the tender points in God's Character. The
   ungodly man who is self-satisfied and has never been made to know the
   truth about his condition, often likens God to an austere man, reaping
   where he has not sown, and gathering where he has not harvested. But
   once let the man know his guilt and mourn it, and then he looks with
   all his eyes to God to spy out mercy in Him--and he is the man who
   delights to learn that God is merciful to the fatherless. This becomes
   a fountain of hope to him.

   Have I here any sin-stricken sinner? Are you desponding and despairing?
   Did you come here feeling that there could be no mercy for you? Catch
   at this word. "In You the fatherless finds mercy." He is a merciful
   God; He is tender, kind, considerate. He evidently looks after the
   helpless and hopeless. He is the patron of those whom others desert.
   Widows without friends, the fatherless without protectors--these are
   the care of God. May you not hope that He will care for you? May you
   not, in the depth of your sin and brokenness of heart, come to Him and
   say, "O Lord, I hear You are the Friend of the friendless, be a Friend
   to me"? It looks like a candle put in the window of your father's house
   to guide you home through the darkness. May God help you to see it--but
   I know that you will not care to see it if there is not a tear in your
   eyes, for none but the needy perceive this gracious Truth of God.

   This encouragement is, moreover, one which is a strong inducement to
   cast away all other confidences. If God is the Friend of the
   fatherless, He may be a Friend to me! Would it not be well for me to
   trust Him and leave off trusting those other things that I have relied
   upon? You see how the text runs, "Ashur shall not save us; we will not
   ride upon horses." These were their great trust and confidence! And
   then they go on to say--"Neither will we worship false gods, for we can
   see that the true God is kind, kind to the fatherless ones and,
   therefore, we may come and trust Him." When a man gets some little
   hope, then he says to himself, "I will even venture to look to the
   Lord." When the prodigal son in the far-off country had spent all his
   living, what was it that brought him back? Why, it was this thought--
   "How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare!"
   This made him resolve to go home again.

   I know what the devil will do--he will tell you that there is no mercy
   for you. He is an old liar! There is abundant mercy for the greatest
   sinner! What does the devil know about it? He never sought mercy and he
   has never had any and never will have any, for he will never seek it!
   But for you, poor Soul, there is bread enough and to spare in your
   Father's house, so why do you perish with hunger? Why not arise and go
   to your Father? If God is the Father of the fatherless, this should
   induce us to hasten to Him and rest in Him. "May I trust in Jesus
   Christ?" asks one. "May I?" Of course you may! It is a sin if you do
   not and, indeed, the chief and most ruinous of sins!

   Many of you are trusting in your sacraments and your priests, or in
   your good works and your prayers, or your own feelings because you
   think that you may not trust Christ. But you may! For He who takes the
   fatherless under His blessed wings invites you to come to Him. "Come
   unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest." If He had ever repulsed one, He might repulse you. But since the
   fatherless find mercy in Him--and all that come to Him find mercy in
   Him--come along with you and trust in the Merciful One at once!
   Furthermore, there is much encouragement in my text because it gives us
   a clear look into the heart of God. I always like to see how a man
   treats children. You learn a great deal about a man when you see that.

   Some men abhor children and almost wish that they could exterminate
   them. As to the fatherless children they say, "Let them go to the
   workhouse--we cannot be troubled with them." The gentle-hearted one
   never sees a little child in need without feeling the utmost pity. I
   feel more sorry for a suffering child than even for a man or a woman.
   Adults have a measure of a power to help themselves, but if there is
   poverty in the house, the little one may pine away, but it cannot get
   relief. Little boys and girls have suffered much in this great city
   when their parents' home has been desolated by poverty, frequently
   caused by drink and other sins. Who knows the sufferings of the little
   ones when father dies? I confess it touches my heart that little
   children should suffer as they do. When men are wicked, one is almost
   thankful that there should be poverty following their sin to whip them
   out of it--but these lambs--what have they done? Any tender heart feels
   this. Is not this a wonderful text which lets us gaze into the heart of
   God while we read, "In You the fatherless finds mercy"?

   Great God, the seraphim adore You! Angels, day without night, in
   serried ranks stand waiting to do Your bidding! Your voice is the
   thunder and the glance of Your eye is the lightning. At Your bidding
   kings die, dynasties decay, empires are blotted out and yet, You care
   for little children and widows! It is very beautiful to me. I feel as
   if I could trust Him all the better for that and come with my daily
   burden and daily cares--yes, and my sins, too--and feel sure that He
   will not refuse me! This is the Father of Jesus, I am sure of it! Oh,
   how like the Son is to the Father, for if the Father is thus the
   children's Patron, what think you of the Son and of His likeness to His
   Father when He said, "Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and
   forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven"? Does not this
   encourage you to come, as you see the heart of God laid bare in the
   blessed statement of the text, "In you the fatherless finds mercy"?

   There is this encouragement, too, that our cases are like those of the
   widow and the fatherless. The orphan has no father, no helper, no means
   of sustenance. And you, my Hearer, are in that state, without God. If
   there is no God, you have no father. If you have no God to trust to,
   you have no protector and you are undone! There is no light for you if
   God is not your light, no hope for you if Christ is not your hope. Do
   you feel that? Well, then, you are an orphan--you are a fatherless one.
   Come along, for Jesus has said, "I will not leave you orphans. I will
   come unto you." Come to Him, and look up into the face of the orphan's
   Father and say, I plead that word of Yours, "In You the fatherless
   finds mercy."

   Lord, let me find mercy, for my case runs parallel with theirs! If
   there is a heart here that needs encouraging, it will spell out my
   meaning. But if you do not need it, and some of you do not, for you are
   fine fellows, full of your own right-

   eousness, then I have nothing to say to you but this, "The whole have
   no need of a physician, but they that are sick. Christ came not to call
   the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

   II. Secondly, for every poor, needy sinner here is ENCOURAGEMENT AS TO
   WHAT TO DO. First, if you want to find salvation, tonight, take the
   text as a sort of spiritual guidebook and plead your need! Do not say
   anything about your merits--the less said about them the better. Your
   position is like that of the Irish servant who said, when asked for his
   character references, that the gentleman at his last place told him he
   would do better without his character than with it. You are just in
   that case, only that you will be asked for your character references
   and the best thing you can do is to say, "My character is as bad as it
   can be"--and then plead for mercy.

   "Lord," it says in the text, "in You the fatherless finds mercy." It
   does not say that they are good and holy, but simply that they are
   fatherless. It does not say that they find rewards, but that they find
   mercy. "Lord, that is all I have to say to You. I am in need--I am in
   awful need--and because I am such a sinner, it makes my need all the
   worse, for that is where my need lies. I need righteousness; I need a
   new heart; I need a right spirit. I need a total change. I need
   everything, for I have nothing but sin and misery. O Lord, I only urge
   that as You help the fatherless, simply and only because they are
   needy, I pray You save me, irrespective of my character, for my need is
   great."

   The next lesson for you is this--be sure to take a hold of this text by
   the handle and ask for mercy. "In You the fatherless finds"--what?
   Finds mercy! Mercy is the handle of the text! When you go to God, ask
   for mercy, not for justice. A mother once went to the Emperor Napoleon
   to ask for mercy for her son. He had committed some breach of the
   French Law and the emperor replied, "Madam, this is the second time the
   boy has offended. Justice requires that he should die," She answered,
   "Sire, I did not come to ask for justice. I beg for mercy." He
   answered, "He does not deserve mercy." "Sire," she said, "it would not
   be mercy if he deserved it. I ask for mercy." When she put it in that
   way, the emperor replied, "Well, then, I will have mercy."

   My unsaved Hearer, you deserve to be in Hell tonight! It is of the
   Lord's mercy that you are not consumed. Do not dream of asking for
   justice, for justice will be your ruin--but get a hold of this word,
   "Lord, I ask for mercy"--and if something whispers, "Why, you have been
   a hardened sinner," say, "Lord, it is true. But, Lord, I ask for
   mercy." "But you have been a backslider." Reply, "Lord, that I have,
   but I ask for mercy on that account." "But you have resisted and
   rejected Grace." "Lord, that is true. And I shall need all the more
   mercy because of that." "But there is nothing in you to argue for
   forgiveness." Say, "Lord, I know there is not, and that is why I ask
   for mercy. I put it wholly on that ground. Display Your mercy in me, I
   beseech You." That is the way to plead! Mind you keep to it. That is
   the straight way. You will get Heaven, too, for you will get Christ,
   too, since His mercy endures forever! "In you the fatherless finds
   mercy."

   Learn another lesson, you that need to get peace with God, at once, and
   I hope that some of you do. Cast your sin, trial and sorrow upon God.
   The text says, "In You the fatherless finds mercy," so the business of
   the fatherless ones is to come to God and just look to Him for
   mercy--and that is your business! Do not, I charge you, look to anybody
   else but the living God to help you. It is a snare, and a horrible one,
   for people to trust to priests! And I will say, in addition to that, to
   trust to ministers, to trust to any man whatever! I have known persons,
   when they have heard an address and have been impressed, to say, "Oh, I
   shall find Christ in the enquiry room!" That enquiry room may be a
   snare to you if you talk thus!

   You need to speak to the man who preached to you, do you? Do not speak
   to him--go directly to Jesus! "But I wish to see that good man who
   spoke to me the other day." Very well, so you may, by-and-by, but mind
   you, do not put that good man or that good woman in the place of
   Christ! The text says, "In You the fatherless finds mercy," and it is
   in Christ, and in Him, alone, that mercy is to be found! Go directly
   and distinctly to Jesus and, by the help of His Spirit, you can do that
   while sitting in the pew! God is everywhere. Let your spirit be
   conscious that God is present and now let your heart speak to Him. To
   Him confess your sin--do not pour that rubbish into the ear of mortal
   man! To God lay bare your heart and to Him, alone! It is not a fit
   sight for any human being. Tell the Lord Jesus all your needs and
   woes--and He will help you--for in the Son of God is the help of the
   sons of men!

   Oh, that I knew how to speak these things, but they will surely go home
   to those who are in spiritual need! You that are not in need--you that
   are good, you that are self-righteous--will see nothing in the text for
   you. No, and there was not meant to be, for the Lord has a people that
   He will draw unto Himself--and these people are known by this--that
   they are weary of themselves. God's chosen people exercise the natural
   art of the weak, namely, clinging. They are made

   to feel their poverty and their need. And then, when they hear of the
   fullness of Christ, they hasten to lay hold on Him. Have you never
   noticed how the plants that God has made weak are all endowed with a
   natural faculty for clinging? One of the first things that the vine
   does is to put forth its tendrils for something to cling to. The hop,
   the wood vine, the sweet pea--they all have a little hook ready to lay
   hold on a support.

   Now, if God is about to bless you at this hour, you have a little
   tendril that is being put out to find something to lay hold of--and as
   the gardener carefully puts his stick for the sweet pea, or as the
   farmer puts his pole for the hop, I have tried to set my text in your
   way. I would set the blessed Lord before you and say, "In Him the
   fatherless finds mercy, cling to Him! Cling to Him! It is your life to
   do it. Cling firmly!" The limpet by the seashore can do little, but it
   can cling! And so it does cling and very firmly, too. That is the one
   thing you can do, poor Sinner, and I pray the Holy Spirit to lead you
   to do it at once! God help you at this moment to cling to Christ! And
   if you do, you are saved, yes, saved at once! In Him the fatherless
   finds mercy. Cling to Him and you shall find mercy, too!

   III. Now, lastly, here is ENCOURAGEMENT AS TO WHAT TO EXPECT OF GOD.
   "In You the fatherless finds mercy." What do the fatherless expect of
   us when we stand in God's place for them? When we take them into our
   Orphanage and try to be as a father to them? What do they expect of us?
   Well, I do not know that the younger ones have intellect enough to know
   all they expect, but they expect everything! They expect all that they
   need and, though they do not quite know what they need, they leave it
   to us. They believe that all will be found that they require. I like a
   poor Christian who does not know all he needs, but yet knows that his
   God will supply all his needs. He trusts Jesus for all. He trusts his
   heavenly Father as a child--he does not know what he may require today,
   or require in the unknown future-- but then his heavenly Father knows
   and he leaves it all to Him.

   As our orphan boys grow older, however, they begin to have a perception
   of their needs, and they trust that they shall have everything provided
   which their own fathers would have provided for them, and more,
   perhaps. So is it with us when we come to the great Father. We say--All
   that I would provide for my children, if I had everything, and could
   give them all that wisdom could desire, my God will provide for me, for
   He will be a Father to me. If you, being evil, know how to give good
   gifts unto your children, much more shall He, who has taken you into
   His family, though you once were fatherless, give all good things to
   you. You shall have food and raiment sufficient for this life. You
   shall have protection, guidance, instruction and tender affection.

   You shall have a touch or two of the rod every now and then, and that
   is among your choice mercies! But you shall also have all the
   cherishing of His sweet love and, by-and-by, when you are fit for it,
   He will take you Home from school and you shall see His face--and you
   shall live forever in His House above, where the many mansions are. Oh,
   if you come and put yourselves, by a simple faith, into the blessed
   custody and keeping of God, He will admit you into His Salvation
   Orphanage and He will take care of you! And you shall find Him a better
   Father than you will be to your own chil-dren--a better Father than the
   best of fathers could ever be to the best beloved of sons!

   "I will be a Father unto you, and you shall be My sons and daughters,
   says the Lord Almighty." I will not say more, but I should like to
   leave John's choice sentence as my last word. "Behold what manner of
   love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons
   of God!" Blessed be Your name, O Lord, that we, also, have been led of
   Your Spirit to prove that in You the fatherless finds mercy!

The Bird Escaped from the Snare

   (No. 1696)

   DELIVERED AT THE THURSDAY EVENING LECTURE,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the
   snare is broken, and we are escaped." Psalm 124:7.

   THIS text describes a soul-matter. The Psalmist is not speaking of a
   temporal deliverance, although, even in that sense, an escape from
   death would be a theme worthy of his sweetest song. He says, "Our soul
   is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers," thus denoting a
   spiritual rescue. The man's soul is the soul of the man and though some
   give all their attention to the body, their folly is great. It is as
   though a man should spend all his substance upon his house and have no
   bread for himself to eat. Do I speak to any who never think about their
   souls? Do you really believe that you will die like dogs and horses? I
   cannot believe that you have such brutal views of yourself! Believe me,
   you have within you an immortal spirit which will outlive the sun! If
   you have, up to now, been careless of your nobler part, may God's
   Spirit teach you wisdom. I pray that you may so think of your soul that
   our text may become deeply interesting to you, so that you may join in
   its song of deliverance.

   I have called the text a song--does it not read like one? "Our soul is
   escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken,
   and we are escaped." It is a canticle of certainty. It does not say,
   "We hope that we have escaped and we trust that the snare is broken,"
   but, "The snare is broken, and we are escaped." "Ifs," and, "buts,"
   make no music! Poetry flees when chance enters! Certainties are
   melodies. We hear people speak of "dead certainties," but the Christian
   rejoices in living certainties, and is wretched till they are his own!
   Rise then, my Beloved, above the fogs and mists which cover the marshes
   of carnal questioning! Climb the mountains of full assurance and stand
   there with your foreheads bathed in sunlight, breathing that serene
   atmosphere which is untainted by a cloud of doubt!

   The text reads like a song, not only because of its certainty, but also
   because of its joy. It has the wing and the throat of a lark! Look how
   it rises from the net to God--"Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
   snare of the fowlers." Soon it takes another rise--"The snare is
   broken." And it mounts yet, again, with still greater joy--"And we are
   escaped." The words melt away into the music of Heaven as the spirit
   perfectly escapes from the snares of earth. The metaphor used in the
   text is simple, but yet beautiful and instructive. Pardon me if I make
   as much of it as I am able to do. First, we have here the bird.
   Secondly, the snare. Thirdly, the capture, and fourthly, the escape. We
   may then add a lesson from it all.

   I. First, we have, here, the soul compared to A BIRD. It is a little
   bird, too--a sparrow, or one of the sparrow kind. "Our soul is escaped
   as a little bird"--not as a great bird that could break the net and
   free itself by its own force. A little bird fitly represents our soul
   when we are lowly in heart. In our unregenerate condition, we think
   ourselves eaglets, at the very least, but we are not great creatures,
   after all. We talk as great men, but we are all little in God's sight.
   "Lord, what is man, that You are mindful of him?" Sparrows were very
   cheap in our Lord's day because of their littleness--in the market you
   could buy two for a farthing and five for two farthings--so that they
   threw an odd bird in when you bought at such a wholesale rate as two
   farthings' worth. Sparrows were inconsiderable things, "yet not one of
   them falls to the ground without your Father." If He cares for
   sparrows, be sure He cares for souls! And when you think least of
   yourself, yet believe that the Lord regards you.

   Again, our soul is like a little bird because it is so ignorant. Birds
   know little about snares, yet they know so much that, "surely in vain
   is the net spread in the sight of any bird." Even this slender wisdom
   is more than men display, for they fly into the net when it is spread
   in their sight! Yes, into the same net out of which, in God's
   Providence, they have just been permitted to escape! Man naturally is
   the essence of folly and he is desperately set on destroying himself.
   He must "see life," he says and, therefore, he haunts the gates of
   death! He reckons the fowler to be his friend and dreams that he
   spreads his nets for purposes of friendly hospitality! He does not know
   that the fowler is hunting for his life and

   will destroy him if he can. So foolish are we and ignorant, we are as
   birds ready for the snare, till the Lord teaches us wis-dom--and even
   then we need hourly keeping, or we are entrapped by the Destroyer.

   Our soul is often like a little bird because it is so eager and
   venturesome. How birds will trust themselves in winter around traps of
   the simplest kind if but a few crumbs are used as bait! Alas, men are
   equally foolhardy--they see others perish, yet they follow their ways!
   Many sip of the intoxicating cup, yet declare they will never be
   drunks! They pilfer a little and yet they despise a thief! They indulge
   in wanton words, but vow to be chaste as snow! They go into
   questionable places of amusement, but hope to remain pure. Oh, silly
   birds! I mean silly souls! Thus the fowler fills his bags. Young people
   associate with ungodly persons and say, "We are not so weak-minded as
   to be led away by them"--thus displaying a weak mind by that boastful
   speech!

   Youths tell us that to read skeptical books, impure novels and to hear
   lewd songs and spicy language will do them no harm. Believe no such
   flattering falsehoods, or you will rue the day! "You don't catch old
   birds with chaff," says the sim-pleton--and he hops into the net.
   "Younger birds must not come here," he says, "it is dangerous for them,
   but I am safe enough." Yet old birds' necks are wrung as well as those
   of young birds--and experienced men are as foolish as the juveniles!
   When a man says, "It is no temptation to me," it may be true, for soot
   will not blacken a sweep. Little birds, beware--the fowler promises
   pleasure, but the end thereof is death! The little bird, also, when
   once taken in the net, is a good comparison with the soul captured by
   sin, for it is defenseless. What can it do?

   A mouse might eat the ropes and set free the lion, but no mouse will
   liberate the sparrow! He will have a short flutter and we shall hear no
   more of him. When a man is birdlimed by a vice, the more he flutters,
   the tighter he is held by it. What is more defenseless than a soul in
   the net of sin? What little power men seem to have against their
   habits! They boast that they can stop anywhere--but, alas, they stop
   nowhere! "Oh, I have only to come to a determination." Yes, "only to
   come to a determination"--but to that determination you will not come!
   When men become entangled in the meshes of sin, their power to escape
   is gone. Jeremiah asks--"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots? Then may you, also, do good, that are accustomed to
   do evil." Such is the entanglement of habit, the slavery of lust.

   While they are thus defenseless, we must notice, too, how alarmed they
   often are. The bird is no sooner in the net than he is frightened. Poor
   thing, how gladly would he escape if he could! Souls are not always so.
   They will be taken in Satan's snares and yet they say that they are
   happy! Custom in sin kills conscience of sin. "A short life and a merry
   one," they say, as if there could be any true merriment anywhere except
   in the great Father's house where they begin to be merry, as if they
   had never been merry before. Many souls have enough of conscience and
   of enlightenment by the Word of God to alarm them when they find
   themselves entangled in sin. And then they beat about and hurt
   themselves, but, alas, notwithstanding all their efforts, unless a
   stronger hand than theirs shall break the net, they will perish by the
   fowler's hand!

   Our souls, once more, are like birds because they are the objects of
   snares. If the Pharisees would compass sea and land to make one
   proselyte, certainly Satan will compass all the universe to ruin a
   single soul, for he delights in destroying the souls of men. Nor is it
   Satan, only, for all the world seems to have taken to this fowling, and
   men who would not lift a finger to save their fellows will go far to
   ruin them! Oh, little birds, there is no place on earth safe for you
   till Jesus covers you with His protecting wings!

   II. Secondly, we will now speak of THE SNARE. The text speaks twice of
   the snare. It is wonderful what a variety of snares there are for
   birds. The tombs of Egypt exhibit the art of bird catching and show us
   decoys, traps, nets and so forth. Such arts are still practiced by
   fowlers. The main point about the snare is that it is concealed. So,
   when the arch-fowler comes after the souls of men, he will not usually
   spread his net in their sight. Some silly birds can be taken in that
   way, but most souls need that the temptation should be veiled. Always
   suspect that in a temptation to sin there is more than you can see!
   Never say that it is a little thing, for great evil lurks in a little
   fault. Death and destruction hide under apparently small offenses.

   Oh, if we could see everything as God sees it, then we poor silly souls
   might be in far less danger! But, alas, Satan covers the hook with a
   tempting bait and we are taken! Snares and traps are usually
   attractive. The poor bird sees seeds which he is fond of and he goes
   for them, little judging that he is to give his life in exchange for
   brief enjoyment. So is it with Satan. He tempts us with pleasures, with
   the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life--we
   taste the

   sweet and are pierced with the smart. Did we perceive the intent of the
   great enemy of souls, we should fly from sin! You know the old adage,
   "Fear the Greeks, even when they bring gifts"--even so, fear a
   temptation to sin, even should it offer you all the kingdoms of this
   world! May God keep us from the attractions which conceal the snare!

   But Satan's snares, like the fowler's, are sadly effectual. Look at the
   quantities of small birds that will be found for sale in the
   markets--fowlers must be exceedingly skillful to catch all these. If we
   could walk through Satan's market, what a multitude of souls should we
   see in his bands! Multitudes upon multitudes are the victims of their
   own passions, victims of that hellish art which makes evil appear to be
   good! God save us from being taken in these most deadly snares! What
   are these snares? I cannot mention them all, for they are legion.
   Snares tuck our bed and snares attend our board. Snares are in the
   street and snares are in the field. Snares are on the table and snares
   are in our daily walk.

   But the chief among them are temptations to sin. The Evil One endeavors
   to lead us into a false way which will be congenial to our taste. We
   each have a peculiar weakness and he knows how to adapt himself to it.
   He has been a student of human nature for so long a time that he knows
   more about man than man knows about himself and he, therefore, chooses
   that bait which is most likely to attract us. Oh that we may have Grace
   to keep clear of pleasurable sin! The rabbis said to the Nazarite who
   was not to drink wine or strong drink, "O Nazarite, go about, go
   about--and do not pass through a vineyard." So, child of God, it will
   be well for you to go about and not enter into temptation. Your Master
   bids you pray, "Lead us not into temptation." Against temptation we are
   to watch and pray as well as against the sin that is likely to come of
   it.

   Another snare is erroneous doctrine. There is plenty of that abroad at
   this time. Be warned! You can have high doctrine and doctrine low;
   broad doctrine and narrow doctrine. You can have it how you like, for
   nowadays every man makes his own gospel and sits in judgment upon the
   Word of God! Dearly Beloved, hold fast the Truth of God, and be not
   decoyed by error! If any come with a new gospel, turn your ears away
   from their deceptive teaching, for false doctrine is the poison of asps
   and the venom of Hell lies within them. Even Christian people are in
   danger from another snare, namely, deceitful action. The Tempter
   whispers, "You need not do evil, but there are different ways of
   judging right and wrong--and it is best to go by the custom of the
   trade!"

   Satan puts things very prettily when he means to ruin us. You have
   somebody else's money entrusted to you. Of course, you would not steal
   it--but yon can use it for a little while--and then replace it. It is
   true, if it should be lost, people will call you a thief, but then you
   are not going to lose it! You are going to double it by your
   cleverness! That is the snare! At other times the temptation is in this
   form--"Be sure to buy the thing if you would like it, though you have
   no money with which to pay for it." You would not steal. No, no! There
   is another way of doing it. Buy it, and do not pay for it. This is one
   of the snares with which Satan seduces men till they are ruined. Ah,
   me, that men should be so moved from their integrity! Oh, child of God,
   be upright in everything! However well you may gloss a matter over, and
   however much others may excuse it, yet if a certain act would be wrong
   in the sight of God, you must not think of it!

   I have noticed another snare. Satan tries to get Christian people to
   ignore the experience of others. A certain good man is often
   melancholy. "Ah," says Satan, "that is how you ought to be--you ought
   to be bowed down with holy sorrow." I remember right well, when I was a
   youth, hearing a preacher say that it was dangerous to be sure of our
   salvation! He preached up the duty, beauty and sweetness of being
   everlastingly in doubt as to your condition! A few people would gather
   around such a preacher and sit and have a little comfortable misery all
   to themselves--and think that they were worshipping God! Now, that is a
   snare to a Christian because he has a right to be glad and, "the joy of
   the Lord is our strength." May we be kept out of that snare!

   On the other hand, anxious people see Christians who are advanced in
   Grace and full of faith while they, themselves, are much cast
   down--then the Evil One whispers, "You are not like those good men! You
   are no Christian." Brother, you cannot have another man's experience
   any more than you can wear another man's face! Certain lovely ferns
   grow best in the shade and never flourish in the sun, while many
   flowers cannot have too much sunlight. Do not wish to be like this man
   or that man, but pray God to make you like Jesus Christ--and to let
   your experience glorify His blessed name! Otherwise, the desire to copy
   others will be a snare to you. Thus I might go on mentioning snares.
   They are, some of them, gross and carnal. But for the spiritual, there
   are snares so neat and pretty that they are apt to be taken in them
   before they are aware!

   According to Pliny, the nets in which the Egyptians took little birds
   were frequently so fine that one person could carry a net large enough
   to encompass a whole tree. Surely, it must have been a small tree, but
   even then, it is a remarkable statement for so reliable a writer to
   have made. We may here see an illustration of the delicacy of those
   temptations with which Satan surrounds the nobler order of minds.
   Strong as iron, yet filmy as gauze, are the snares for spiritual men.
   Why, Satan can encompass a whole Church with one of those nets and you
   scarcely know that it is there! And yet the minds within its meshes are
   quite unable to mount up and sing unto their Lord, as once they did,
   for they are within an invisible net.

   III. We cannot further dwell on the subject of the snare, but we must
   turn to consider THE CAPTURE. Birds are taken in nets and souls are
   taken by temptations to sin, by errors of doctrine and by a thousand
   other methods. Dear Friends, it is a dreadful thing for the poor little
   bird, when it is taken, especially when it is so anxious to escape that
   it hurts itself in its efforts to get free. How came it to be taken? It
   may have been taken through hunger. Half-starved, it dashed into peril
   for necessary food. Many true men are in such straits and difficulties
   that they are sadly liable to be brought into the net.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, pray God to deliver you from poverty and
   from great riches, for there are perilous snares about each of those
   positions. May you be neither exalted nor depressed, but preserved in
   the middle path of experience. If you are extremely needy, you may be
   tempted to do wrong to provide for your wife and family. I pray that
   you may never yield to the temptation, but trust in God and He will
   deliver you without your putting forth your hands unto iniquity. Other
   birds are taken merely by their appetite. They are not excessively
   hungry, but they enjoy certain choice seeds and the fowler knows
   it--and he scatters such around the trap. Ease of body, indulgence of
   taste, the joy of being admired, the sweets of power and position--all
   these and many more have been the fowler's baits.

   Hundreds have all that heart ought to wish for, but they desire to be
   rich and, therefore, fall into a thousand snares which they might have
   avoided. Men are snared by eating and by drinking; by fine raiment and
   by vainglorious display. Snares lie thickly around the appetites of the
   body and the longings of the mind. Some persons are entrapped by fear.
   Birds have rushed into the net for fear of danger--many persons have
   become great offenders against God through lack of moral courage. They
   are afraid of the laughter of fools! They cannot bear the sarcasm of
   the so-called wise--and so they suppress the Truth of God and join in
   sin to escape scorn. God give us a holy bravery with which to defy
   every man's opinion when we know that we are obeying the Lord!

   Some little birds are lost by love of company. The fowler has a decoy
   which sings sweetly or chirps pleasantly and the other birds must
   follow it. In the Church of God we lose many members by ungodly
   marriages. The worldling pipes his pretty note and the tender heart is
   taken by it. The fair enthusiast says, "I shall convert him," but it is
   very, very seldom that this happens--it is usually the other way! This
   is a snare of Satan in which many are taken. Thus you see how souls are
   captured. Perhaps I am speaking to one here who has flown into the net.
   You do not know what to do, Friend, for you are quite helpless to break
   your bonds. You went in very eagerly and, oh, how eagerly you would get
   out, again, if you could! But you cannot escape. Your own helplessness
   is now apparent as it never was before.

   One thing, however, you can do--you can cry to One who is stronger than
   you! You can pray the Lord to pluck your feet out of the net--and He is
   able to do it, for all things are possible with Him!

   IV. Just a word or two upon THE ESCAPE. This is a very blessed text,
   although the sermon has been gloomy so far, for now we shall see the
   fowler disappointed and the captive let loose! I wish that everybody
   here could repeat the utterance and cry, "Our soul is escaped. We were
   in the net, but our soul has escaped. The snare is broken! It has no
   power over us any longer. We are free from its grasp! We have escaped!
   Up, up, we soar away from the fowler and his nets. Glory be to God, we
   have escaped!--

   "As when the fowler's snare is broke,

   The bird escapes on cheerful wings

   My soul, set free from Satan's yoke,

   With joy bursts forth, and mounts, and sings." This escape is due to
   God, alone! As the bird could not get out of the snare, so the soul
   cannot escape from temptation, but God can bring it out, and He works
   the rescue. Hear this, you that are slaves to drunkenness--God can
   deliver you! You that have fallen into licentiousness--hear it--God can
   deliver you! Whatever the sin that has birdlimed you, those gracious
   hands which once were nailed to the Cross can set you free! Up, up, up,
   you that pine on the borders of

   despair! Jesus can deliver you! He that made the world out of nothing
   can make a joyful Christian even out of you! He can turn your mourning
   into dancing and your despair into confidence.

   This escape is achieved by power. That word, "broken," has force in it.
   "The snare is broken"--the meshes torn with a strong hand; the steel
   trap dashed in pieces! It matters not what danger you are in, there is
   power enough in God to fetch you out of it! I thought, once, that God
   could never save me. I supposed that He would bless my brother and my
   sisters, but that He would leave me--yet He did save me, blessed be His
   name! And you, too, He is able to deliver. "Oh, but I am the odd man,"
   cries one! Then there are two of us! And if God has saved one odd man,
   He can surely save another--and why should He not save you, in spite of
   all your eccentricity? "But I do not think that He will save me." What
   are your thoughts worth? He can save even you! Only trust Him, though
   you are in the net, and out of that net you shall be fetched, for He
   leaves no soul to perish that puts its trust in Him!

   Observe that the escape was complete--"the snare is broken, and we are
   escaped." As long as a little bird has the tiniest bit of cotton tied
   to its leg, and that is fastened anywhere, the bird has not escaped.
   And as long as you have one evil habit--one wrong thing that you really
   love--you have not escaped! You must be altogether separated from your
   sins. No man can be married to Christ till he is divorced from sin. Our
   deliverance must be complete, or it is not true. Who can give us this
   but the Lord Jesus Christ by His blessed Spirit? Trust Him to set you
   free and no net shall hold you! I would again put the question, "How
   many of us can say, 'We have escaped?'" Let us sing unto the Lord if we
   can--and let those who cannot say that they are free, continue to plead
   earnestly with God that He would deliver them.

   V. I would close with THE LESSON which this subject ought to teach us.
   A word or two only. It ought to teach us, first, to sing, for if a bird
   gets out of the net, does it not sing? How glad it seems to be when
   once it flies away! Oh, you that have been delivered from sin and
   Satan, sing unto the Lord! Praise and bless His name! Be as happy as
   possible. Be something more than full of happiness! How can that be?
   Why, be so full of it that it overflows and cheers others. Let us
   communicate our joy as far as we can, for we are escaped. We are
   escaped and we will praise the blessed God who broke the snare.

   Next, let us trust, for if the Lord has saved us from the dreadful
   snare of sin and Satan, He will save us from everything else. It is
   sad, to me, that any should trust the Lord with their souls and yet
   they cannot trust Him for their daily bread, or for help in their daily
   trials! This must not be! If the Lord has given our soul so great an
   escape, depend upon it, He will take care of our bodies. He that gave
   us Jesus will give us food and raiment and let us be content. Lastly,
   let us watch. If we have fallen into the snare, once, let us keep our
   eyes open not to go there again. May the Holy Spirit prevent any child
   of God from turning aside, even for a moment, from the straight way.
   "Let them not turn again to folly," is one of God's own cautions to His
   people. He has brought you up out of the horrible Pit--do not play near
   the edge of it. He has set your feet on a rock--what have you to do
   with the miry clay? Get away from the slippery ground and let your
   goings be established on the rock.

   I would say, again, to you netted ones--you that are really caught in
   the trap and held fast--oh, that the Lord would come at once and set
   you free! I think He will, yes, I am sure that He will if you cry to
   Him to do so. I have heard of a sailor who had been in prison, that
   after his release, he had money in his pocket and, going over London
   Bridge, he saw a man selling birds--thrashes, larks and so on. "What do
   you want for the lot?" said Jack. I forget how much it was, but Jack
   found the money and, as soon as the birds were his, he opened the door
   and let them all fly away. The man called out "Whatever did you buy
   those birds for, and then let them out?" "Oh," said the sailor, "if you
   had been in prison as I have been, you would be sure to set everything
   free you could get a hold of."

   You and I ought to display the same kind of feeling towards all poor
   ensnared souls. I am sure that the Lord Jesus Christ is more
   tender-hearted than we are and, therefore, He will certainly come and
   set free all prisoners who beg Him to open their cage doors! He is the
   great Emancipator--show Him your bonds and beg for liberty--and He will
   set you free!

The Word of a King

   (No. 1697)

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON.

   AT THE OPENING OF A NEW BAPTIST CHAPEL, TRINITY ROAD, UPPER TOOTING.

   "Where the word of a king is, there is power." Ecclesiastes 8:4.

   KINGS in Solomon's day had a vast amount of power, for their word was
   absolute. They did according to their own will and none could check
   them, for, as Solomon said, "the king's wrath is as the roaring of a
   lion: whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own soul." When
   such a monarch happened to be wise and good, it was a great blessing to
   the people, for, "a king that sits in the throne of judgment scatters
   away all evil with his eyes." But if he was of a hard, tyrannical
   nature, his subjects were mere slaves and groaned beneath a yoke of
   iron. We do not sufficiently give thanks for the blessings of a
   constitutional government, but if we were, for a season, put beneath
   the power of a grinding despotism, we should set more store by those
   liberties for which we have to thank our Puritan ancestors. Mercies are
   seldom appreciated till they are taken away. May we not prove
   ungrateful under free institutions, for if so, we shall be more brutish
   than any men.

   There is, however, blessed be the Lord, one King whose power we do not
   wish, in any degree, to limit or circumscribe. God does as He wills
   among the armies of Heaven and among the inhabitants of this lower
   world--none can stay His hand, or say unto Him, What are you doing? In
   this we greatly rejoice! The personal rule of one individual would be
   the best form of government if that individual were perfectly good,
   infinitely wise and abundant in power. And the reason why an autocrat
   turns into a despot is that there is no man who is perfectly good,
   unselfish, or wise! God has no fault or failing and, therefore, it is a
   joy that He does according to His will. He never wills anything that is
   not strictly just-- in the exercise of absolute sovereignty He is
   neither unjust nor unmerciful--it is not possible for Him to err and,
   therefore, it is a great subject for joy that "the Lord reigns, He is
   clothed with majesty. The Lord sits upon the floods; yes, the Lord sits
   King forever and ever; let Israel rejoice, and let the children of Zion
   be joyful in their King. "Say among the heathen that the Lord reigns:
   the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: He
   shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let
   the earth be glad; let the seas roar, and the fullness thereof."

   Now, because God is the absolute Monarch, His Word has power about it
   and of that Word of power I am going to speak at this time. May the
   Holy Spirit help us to think of the power of God's Word for four
   purposes! First, to excite our awe. Secondly, to ensure our obedience.
   Thirdly, to inspire our confidence. And, fourthly, to direct our
   efforts.

   I. First, we would see the power of the Word of the Lord in order TO
   EXCITE OUR AWE OF HIM. What are we poor creatures of a day? What is
   there in us as we appear in God's sight? Do we not pass away as the
   flower of the field? As for our word, what is it? We sometimes talk
   exceedingly proudly and we say, "shall," and, "will," as if we could do
   anything--when, after all, our word is but breath, a vapor, a mere
   sound in the air! Man proposes, but God disposes. Man resolves, but God
   dissolves. That which man expects, God rejects, for the Word of the
   Lord stands forever--but man passes away and is not.

   Think of the day before all days when there was no day but the Ancient
   of Days and when God dwelt all alone. Then He willed in His mind that
   there should be a world created. "He spoke, and it was done: He
   commanded, and it stood fast." "By the Word of the Lord were the
   heavens made; and all the hosts of them by the breath of His mouth."
   What a word is that which created all things! And remember that this
   same word can destroy all things, for, "the heavens and the earth,
   which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire
   against the Day of Judgment and perdition of ungodly men." If He were
   but to speak, all things that are would melt away as a moment's foam
   dissolves into the wave that bears it and is lost forever! "You turn
   man to destruction; and say, Return, you children of men"--and at that
   irresistible word, man's spirit returns to God who gave it and his body
   disintegrates into dust!

   When the Lord created, He used no hand of cherubim or seraphim--all
   that we read in the sublimely simple record of Genesis is, "God said,
   let there be," and there was. His word accomplished all and when He
   wills to destroy either one man or a million, His word is able to work
   His will. What a mighty word was that which in one night cut off the
   host of Sennacherib and slew the first-born of Egypt! The Word of the
   Lord commanded the floods and they drowned a guilty world--and that
   same word rained fire from Heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah! Even so, in
   the Last Day, when the word shall go forth from Him, He shall shake not
   only the earth, but also Heaven--and at His word of power both Heaven
   and earth shall flee away!

   Great God, we do adore You, for You are both Creator and Destroyer by
   Your Word! Think how God's Word both makes alive and kills. He promised
   Abraham that he should have a seed in whom all the nations of the earth
   should be blessed. It seemed impossible that there should come from him
   a son that should be the founder of a race--his body was dead and Sarah
   was old--yet God, in due time, made them to laugh, for Isaac was born
   into the house! The Lord sets the solitary in families. "He makes the
   barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children." It
   is the Lord who makes alive and, equally is it the Lord who kills. It
   only needs God to will it and the pestilence lays men low in heaps,
   like the grass of the meadow when the mower's scythe has passed over
   it. The Lord has but to call for pestilence or war and myriads of men
   are laid low.

   If He wills to chasten by famine, He calls for devouring insects and
   they invade the land. And this Joel attributes to the word of Jehovah,
   when He says, "And the Lord shall utter His voice before His army; for
   His camp is very great: for He is strong that executes His word: for
   the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?"
   Oh, how we ought to worship You, You dread Supreme, upon whose Word
   life and death are made to hang! I might in another division of this
   part of my subject remind you of the power which attends both His
   promises and His threats. God has never promised without performing, in
   due time, to the last jot and tittle. Has He said, and shall He not do
   it? Has He commanded, and shall it not come to pass? The gifts and
   calling of God are without repentance--He turns not from His Covenant
   engagements and swerves not from the performance of His Word.

   Those that have resisted Him have found His threats to be true,
   also--let Pharaoh confess how the plagues followed fast upon the Word
   of the Lord till even his stout heart was melted within him! Men have
   gone on, for a while, resisting God, and in their pride they have
   laughed Him to scorn, but, by-and-by, He has spoken to them in His
   wrath and vexed them in His hot displeasure. Who can stand against this
   terrible God, whose word overthrows the mighty, and casts the proud
   beneath His feet? There is power in God's Word to foretell, so that,
   when He tells what is to be in the future, we know that it shall come
   to pass. "Seek you out of the Book of the Lord, and read: no one of
   these shall fail, none shall want her mate." Thus says the Lord, "I
   have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I
   will also do it."

   In the Word of the Lord there is also power to predestinate as well as
   to foretell, so that what He decrees is fixed and certain. "There are
   many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord,
   that shall stand." The Lord has said it, "My counsel shall stand, and I
   will do all My pleasure." Let this be your joy, today, that whatever is
   promised of the latter day and of the Glory that is to be revealed, is
   sure to come to pass, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. It seems
   impossible that the heathen should ever be the Lord's, or that the
   uttermost parts of the earth should be Christ's possession, but it will
   be, for the King has said it, and, "Where the word of a king is, there
   is power."

   We fear that the time will never arrive when peace shall reign through
   all the world--and when men shall hang the helmet in the hall and study
   war no more--but the vision of faith shall yet become a fact, for,
   "Where the word of a king is, there is power." He spoke of old of Edom
   and Moab, Philistia and Ammon, Nineveh and Babylon, Greece and Rome.
   And whatever He has spoken has been fulfilled! Not one word of the
   prophecies of Daniel and Ezekiel has failed of its accomplishment! And
   we may be sure that not one glorious vision of the seer of Patmos will
   remain a dream. Let us worship the great Ordainer, Benefactor and
   Ruler, whose every word is the word of a King, in which there is
   power--

   "His very word of Grace is strong As that which built the skies The
   voice that rolls the stars along Speaks all the promises."

   II. Secondly, we would think of the power of God's Word in order TO
   ENSURE OUR OBEDIENCE TO IT. Whenever God gives a word of command, it
   comes to us clothed with authority, and its power over our minds should
   be immediate and unquestioned. I hope that, in laying the foundation of
   the spiritual building that is to be erected in connection

   with this place, you will take care to do it according to the
   directions of the Divine statute-book. One is our Master, even Christ,
   and we have to do our Master's will, not our own. Some Christian people
   do not view the authority of God's Word as paramount, but consult human
   leaders or their preferences. This is to begin with the word of man--a
   weak and sandy foundation! I beseech you do not so.

   To Christians the Word of God is the only rule of faith and practice.
   Our doctrine is of authority because it is God's Word, and for no other
   reason. Our ordinances are valid because instituted by God's Word--they
   are idle ceremonies if they are not so commanded. All the rites, rules
   and regulations of man are of no value. The book of human decrees is
   not to be regarded in the Church of Christ. You may put in the front of
   it, "printed by authority," but to the Church of Christ it has no
   authority! You may adopt a creed as the standard of any particular
   Church, but that gives it no authority to bind the conscience! It may
   be authorized by princes, bishops and holy men, but where it differs
   from the Word of the Lord, or adds thereto, it is, to the children of
   God, as a puff of wind! The sole authority in the Church is Christ,
   Him-self--He is the Head of His Church and His Word is the only
   authority by which we are ruled--for, "where the word of a king is,
   there is power," but all are usurpers who act as lords in the Church,
   where Jesus, alone, is Master and Lord.

   Christians should more diligently search the Word of God to find out
   what the will of the Lord is on all matters affecting their everyday
   life. A loyal subject of the great King wants to know what the King
   would have him do. When he knows it, it is not for him to question or
   to cavil, but to obey. Brothers and Sisters, let us obey, in all
   things, the King's Word, and give to His Holy Word the honor that it
   justly claims, for, "where the word of a king is, there is power."
   Every precept that He gives, He intends us to keep. He does not ordain
   it that we may question it. He commands, that we may obey. Let me refer
   you to what Solomon says in the second verse of this chapter, "I
   counsel you to keep the king's commandments." This is admirable counsel
   for every Christian--if the commandments were of men, even the wisest
   of men, we might break them and, perhaps, do right in breaking them.
   But if they are of the King who gives the command, even the Lord Jesus
   Christ, who is the King in Zion, then the advice of the Preacher is
   wise and weighty--"I counsel you to keep the king's commandments."

   Perhaps some of you would ask me, this afternoon, "What is the best
   course for me to pursue in certain difficult cases?" "I counsel you to
   keep the King's Commandments." "But I am a young man just beginning
   life and may get into trouble if I am rigidly scrupulous in doing that
   which is right." "I counsel you to keep the King's Commandments." "But
   at this present time I may lose my job if I keep all His statutes.
   Could I not wink rather hard and forget one of the Commandments for a
   little while?" "I counsel you to keep the King's Commandments." If He
   is a King, then it is a solemn hazard to your soul if you come short of
   the least of His Commandments! Remember that one treason makes a
   traitor! One leak sinks a ship. One fly spoils the whole box of
   ointment. He that bought us with His blood deserves to be obeyed in all
   things, with all our heart, mind, soul and strength!

   Such a King as we have ought never to hear us ask the reason why He
   commands, but we should be like the brave men of Balaclava, of whom the
   poet said--

   "Theirs not to reason why, Theirs not to make reply, Theirs but to dare
   and die."

   Solomon goes on to say, "Be not hasty to go out of his sight." There is
   such power in God's Word that I would have you also obey this precept
   and seek to remain in His Presence. Some of His people seek to get away
   from their Lord instead of keeping close to Him. So little do they
   delight in communion with their God that they seem to say, "Where shall
   I go from Your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from Your Presence?" Did
   it never happen to you as it did to Jonah, when he felt he had to go to
   Tarshish, though the Lord told him to go to Nineveh? He did not want
   such a large field of labor, such an anxious and unrewarding post of
   duty--he would rather go to a village station, or to a seaside place.
   For a time he believed that Providence helped him, for he found a ship
   going to Tarshish.

   There are many devil's providences which make sin easy and obedience
   difficult. The precept, not the Providence, is the rule of duty! The
   providence which gave Judas the opportunity to sell his Master did not
   excuse that son of perdition! "So he paid the fare thereof, and went
   down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the Presence of the
   Lord." Alas, poor Jonah! To be thus eager to run counter to the Word of
   a King! I remember how I felt when first in London--I could not endure
   the horrible wilderness of bricks by which I was surrounded! I sighed
   for the green fields and the fresh

   air--and I longed to get back to my country charge. But this kind of
   self-indulgence will not do! "Where the word of a king is, there is
   power," and wherever the King sends you, you must go, and go without
   questioning.

   If He should send you to preach at the gates of Hell, go and preach
   there! "Be not hasty to go out of His sight," for if you get out of the
   sight of the King--if you no longer wait in His blessed Presence,
   depend upon it--like Jonah, you will fall into trial, tempest, sinking
   and terror! There may be no whale to swallow you and cast you up,
   again--they are not so plentiful, now, as they were then--and you may
   not be delivered so easily as Jonah! Keep in the Lord's Presence and
   favor, no matter where you may have to go in order to do so. Walk in
   communion with Christ in whatever path He may point out to you. Never
   mind how rough it is! Do not imagine it is the wrong road because it is
   so rough--rather reckon it to be right because it is rough, for seldom
   do smoothness and rightness go together. Oh, to abide in Christ the
   Word, and to have His Word abiding in us!

   Solomon then says, "Stand not in an evil thing." There is such power in
   the Word of God that He can readily destroy you, or heavily chastise
   you. Therefore, be quick to amend and, "stand not in an evil thing."
   Repent, obey, submit, confess, seek pardon at once! He who is a
   courtier in a king's court, if he offends against his sovereign, or
   does anything disgraceful, apologizes and trusts that he will not so
   offend any more and oh, you child of God, if at any time you shall
   offend against your gracious Sovereign and He frowns on you, humble
   yourself, for His stroke is heavy! "Be you not as the horse, or as the
   mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit
   and bridle." Have a tender mouth--let God guide you with His eyes--let
   a word be enough for you!

   I wish we all had great tenderness of conscience. We should tremble at
   God's Word and humble ourselves in the dust before Him, praying to be
   cleansed by His Grace. If a person wished to practice deeds of infamy,
   he would not do it in the Queen's audience room, especially if her eyes
   were fixed upon him! And so sin should be impossible to a Believer who
   lives in the Presence of the King, in whose Word there is power! Will
   you offend Him to His face and slight Him in His own courts? No! Yield
   yourself to His mercy and let your holy life prove that His Word has
   power over your heart and conscience.

   III. And now, thirdly, TO INSPIRE OUR CONFIDENCE, let us think that
   "where the word of a king is, there is power." If there is a heart here
   that is seeking mercy, if you can go before God with such a promise as
   this in your mouth, "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He
   will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly
   pardon"--that Word of His is not a mere sound--there is the power of
   the Truth of God in it! If you do what He, there, bids you do, you
   shall find that He can and will abundantly pardon! Whatever sins you
   have committed, though they are too many to count, and too awful to
   mention, if you will come and trust yourself with Jesus Christ, God's
   Word is that you shall be saved--and saved you shall be! "He that
   believes on Him is not condemned." "He that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life." Come and plead these words, now, you who feel your
   sinfulness, and you shall prove, in your joyful experience, that they
   are the power of God unto salvation!

   Even the very worst may come and plead the promises! And they shall
   obtain immediate pardon and full forgiveness--and their soul shall know
   it because of the sweet peace that comes from forgiven sin! Do you tell
   me that you cannot conquer your evil passions and corrupt desires? Here
   is a promise from the Word of the Lord, "From all your filthi-ness and
   from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give
   you, and a new spirit will I put within you" (Ezek. 36:25). Now come
   and plead these precious promises! There is power in them--they are the
   Words of a King, and if you plead them at the Mercy Seat, you shall
   become a new creature in Christ Jesus! Old things shall pass away! All
   things shall become new!

   When you get a promise from God, treat it as undoubted truth and rely
   upon it as you do upon the promise of your father or your friend. There
   are men around you whose promises you never can believe--when they
   promise to pay you, you dare not regard it as an asset in business, for
   you are too sadly aware that you have a little bundle of their I O U's,
   already, and you have had a view of their dishonored bills and checks
   endorsed with "insufficient funds." But God's Word is not like that of
   false and fickle mortals. No charge of falsehood or failure can be
   brought against the God of Truth! He has never broken His Word, yet,
   and He never will! Then, dear Souls, if you need forgiveness of sin and
   renewal of heart, get the promise to that effect and believe it with
   all your soul! And as sure as it is the Word of a King you shall be
   washed in the blood and in the water which flowed from the wounded side
   of the crucified Christ.

   And you Christian people, are there any of you who are struggling, at
   this time, with a remaining corruption which you cannot conquer? Come
   and lay hold of the promise that you shall overcome and plead it before
   the Mercy Seat! If you do but get any promise of God suited to your
   case, make quick use of it, for there is power in it! It is the Word of
   a King! Mr. Durham, the writer of ancient and precious comments upon
   Solomon's Song and the Revelation, when dying, was somewhat distressed
   in mind and said to a friend who was standing by his bedside, "Out of
   all the Scriptures there is not one text that yields me comfort, save
   only one, and that is one that I have often held out to perishing
   sinners, little thinking I should have to cling to it myself--'him that
   comes unto Me I will in no wise cast out.' Brother So-and-So, do you
   think that this is strong enough to bear my weight now?" "Yes," his
   friend replied, "and to bear the weight of ten thousand times ten
   thousand if they rest upon it."

   What was said of that text is true of every other Word of God! The
   promise of the Lord will bear the weight of sin and justice, life and
   death, judgment and Hell. Lean your whole weight on the Word of God and
   you shall find it to be like Mount Zion which cannot be removed, but
   abides forever! For my own part, I have no shadow of a hope but in the
   Word of the Lord--His Spirit has delivered me from all reliance upon
   duties, or feelings, or experiences. The Word of the Lord is the life
   of my soul. In the words of King Jesus there is power to save you, to
   renew you, to pardon you, to preserve you, to sanctify you and to
   perfect you! If you have hold on the promises, they will hold you for
   time and eternity, too.

   Then, are there any of you in great trouble? I cannot know all your
   cases, but if any one of you has a trial which you could not tell, or a
   trouble which, if you did tell it, nobody could help you out of--go and
   spread it before the Lord. Remember His Word, "Many are the afflictions
   of the righteous: but the Lord delivers him out of them all." Go and
   tell Him that He has thus spoken and that He has therein pledged
   Himself to deliver you out of all afflictions--and be sure of this, He
   will be as good as His Word! Do you expect to die soon? Are you
   somewhat distressed because sickness is undermining your constitution?
   Be not afraid, for His Spirit teaches you to sing, "Yes, though I walk
   through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for You
   are with me; Your rod and Your staff they comfort me." Go and tell the
   Lord of His own Word and you will look forward to death without fear,
   singing--

   "Knowing as I am known, How shall I love that word, And oft repeat
   before the throne, 'Forever with the Lord!' That Resurrection word,
   That shout of victory, Once more, 'Forever with the Lord!' Amen--so let
   it be!"

   Brothers and Sisters, one more point is gained concerning the fear of
   death when we remember that it is the voice of a King which will recall
   our bodies from the grave and, "where the word of a king is, there is
   power." Do we ask mournfully as we survey the graveyard, "Can these dry
   bones live?" We are not slow to answer with assurance of faith! He that
   brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the
   sheep, will also bring forth from their sepulchers all His sheep! "If
   the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He
   that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal
   bodies by His Spirit that dwells in you." We do not doubt this when we
   remember that with the trumpet of the archangel shall also be heard the
   voice of God, which voice shall speak the Omnipotent

   Word--

   "Break from His throne, illustrious morn! Attend, O earth, His
   sovereign Word! Restore the saint, a glorious form He must ascend to
   meet his Lord." IV. Fourthly, I am coming to my last point, on which I
   shall crave a little time--and here I intend to address myself to all
   people of God who are associated in Church fellowship, striving to do
   the Lord's service and to you who will be so associated here. My text
   is to be used TO DIRECT YOUR EFFORTS. You need power--not the power of
   money, or mind, or influence, or numbers--but "power from on high." All
   other power may be desirable, but this power is indispensable.
   Spiritual work can only be done by spiritual power. I counsel you, in
   order to get spiritual power in all that

   you do, to keep the King's Commandments, for "where the word of a king
   is, there is power." Lay not a stone of your spiritual Church without
   His overseeing! Do all things according as He has ordained! Regard Him
   as the wise Master Builder and be, all of you, under the command of His
   Word.

   The day comes when much that has been built shall be destroyed, for the
   fire will try every man's work of what sort it is. It is very easy to
   heap up a Church with wood, hay and stubble, which the fire will soon
   destroy. And it is very difficult work to build one up with gold,
   silver and precious stones, for these are rare materials and must be
   diligently sought for, laboriously prepared and carefully guarded. The
   materials that will stand the fire of temptation, trial, death and the
   like, are not to be brought together by any word but the Word of the
   Lord--and these, alone, are worth having. I had sooner have
   half-a-dozen Christian people, truly spiritual and obedient to the Word
   of the Lord in all things, than I would have half-a-dozen thousands of
   nominal Christians who neither care about the Word of God nor the King.
   If you need power, keep the King's Commandments! Keep close to them in
   all things and make it the Law of your house and the slogan of your
   flag.

   Wherein you go beyond the Word of God, you go beyond the power. And
   wherein you stop short of the Word of God, you also stop short of the
   power. In the King's Word there is power and you will have power as
   long as you keep to it--and real power is nowhere else to be found. Let
   us take care that we do not look elsewhere for power, for that will be
   leaving the Fountain of Living Waters to hew out for ourselves broken
   cisterns which hold no water. I fear that some Christian people have
   been looking in many other directions for the power which can only be
   found in the Word of the King. At one time we were told that power lay
   in an educated ministry. People said, "We must have a minister who
   knows Greek and Latin! You cannot save souls unless you are familiar
   with the heathen classics." This superstition has suffered many a blow
   from the manifest successes of those whose only language is the grand
   old Saxon!

   Then the cry was, "Well, really, we do not need these men of
   education--we need fluent speakers, men who can tell a great many
   anecdotes and stories--these are men of power." I hope we shall outgrow
   this delusion, also. The Lord works by either of these classes of men,
   or by others who have not the qualifications of either of them, or by
   another sort of men, or 50 sorts of men, so long as they keep to the
   Word of the King, in which there is power! There is power in the Gospel
   if it is preached by a man utterly without education--unlearned men
   have done great things by the power of the Word of God! The polished
   doctor of divinity has been equally useful when he has kept to his
   Master's Word. But if either of these has forgotten to make Christ's
   Word first and last, the preaching has been, alike, powerless, whether
   uttered by the illiterate or the profound.

   Others have thought it necessary, in order to have power among the
   masses, (that is the cant phrase), that there should be fine music. An
   organ is, nowadays, thought to be the power of God--and a choir is a
   fine substitute for the Holy Spirit! They have tried that kind of thing
   in America, where solos and quartets enable singing men and singing
   women to divide their services between the church and the theater! Some
   churches have paid more attention to the choir than to the preaching. I
   do not believe in it! If God had meant people to be converted in that
   way, He would have sent them a command to attend the music halls and
   operas, for there they will get far better music than we can hope to
   give them.

   If there are charms in music to change the souls of men from sin to
   holiness and if the preaching of the Gospel will not do it--let us have
   done with Peter and Paul, with Chalmers and with Chrysostom--and let us
   exalt Mozart and Handel into their places! And let the great singers of
   the day take the places of the pleaders for the Lord. Even this would
   not content the maniacs of this age, for with the music room they crave
   the flippancy of the theater. Combine with philosophy the sweet flowers
   of oratory and those of Covent Garden, adding thereto the man-millinery
   and gewgaws of Rome--and then you can exclaim with the idolaters of
   old--"These are your gods, O Israel." Men are now looking for
   omnipotence in toys! But we do not believe it. We come back to this,
   "Where the word of a king is, there is power," and while we are
   prepared to admit that all and everything that has to do with us can be
   the vehicle of spiritual power if God so wills, we are more than ever
   convinced that God has spiritual power to give by His word, alone!

   We must keep to the King's word if we desire to have this spiritual
   power for the Lord's work. Whatever you find in Scripture to be the
   command of the Lord, follow it, though it leads you into a course that
   is difficult for the flesh to bear--I mean a path of singular
   spirituality and nonconformity to the world. Remember that, after all,
   the Truth of God may be with the half-dozen and not with the million.
   Christ's power may be with the handful as it was at Pentecost,

   when the power came down upon the despised disciples--and not upon the
   chief priests and scribes--though they had the sway in religious
   matters! If we want to win souls for Christ we must use the Word of God
   to do it! Other forms of good work languish unless the Gospel is joined
   with them.

   Set about reforming, civilizing and elevating the people, and you will
   lose your time unless you evangelize them. The total abstinence
   movement is good and I would that all would aid it, but it effects
   little unless the Gospel furnishes the motive and the force. It will
   win its way in proportion as it is carried on in subordination to the
   Gospel and is viewed as a means to reach a still higher end! The rod
   works no wonder till Moses grasps it and moral teaching has small force
   till Jesus operates by it. Those who doubt the power of the Gospel and
   leave it for other forms of hopeful good, leave strength for weakness,
   Omnipotence for insufficiency. More and more I am persuaded that it is
   where the Word of a King is that there is power, and all the rest is
   feebleness until that Word has infused might into it.

   Everyone must buy his own experience, but mine goes to prove to me that
   the direct and downright preaching of the Gospel is the most profitable
   work which I ever engage in--it brings more Glory to God and good to
   men than all lecturing and addressing upon moral subjects. I should
   always, if I were a farmer, like to sow that seed which would bring me
   the best return for my labor. Preaching the Gospel is the most paying
   thing in the world--it is remunerative in the very highest sense. May
   your minister stick to the Gospel, the old-fashioned Gospel, and preach
   nothing else but Jesus Christ and Him Crucified! If people will not
   hear that, do not let them hear anything at all! It is better to be
   silent than to preach anything else. Paul said, and I will say the
   same, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ,
   and Him Crucified."

   Then again, if you need power, you must use this Word in pleading. If
   your work here is to be a success, there must be much praying.
   Everything in God's house is to be done with prayer. Give me a praying
   people and I shall have a powerful people. The Word of the King is that
   which gives power to our prayers. I have been requested to preach in
   certain places and I have replied that I could not go. In a little time
   I have received a letter to remind me that two years before I promised
   to go. This altered the case--I had no choice. I must go, whether I
   could or not, for my word was pledged to it. So if you can go to the
   Lord with His pledged Word and say, "Lord, You have said it. You must
   do it," He will be true to His Word to you, for there is power in the
   Word of a King! There is power in accepting that Word, in getting it
   into you, or receiving it. You will never keep the Truth of God till
   you have received this Word of a King into your spiritual being and
   absorbed it into your spiritual nature. Oh, that you might, every one
   of you, eat the Word of God, live on it and make it your daily food!

   And then, there is power in the practicing of it. Where there is life
   through the King's Word, it will be a strong life. The sinner's life is
   a feeble life, but an obedient life--an earnest Christian life--a life
   of strength. Even those who hate it and abhor it, cannot help feeling
   that there is a strange influence about it which they cannot explain,
   and they must respect it. You will see its power in this place! I know
   you will see it, for you are resolved, in God's strength, that it shall
   be so. You will see its power to fill the place. There is nothing so
   attractive as the Gospel of Christ! If you were to give a man the
   Tabernacle at Newington, and say to him, "There, you may lecture on
   geology, astronomy, or anything you like, twice on the Sunday, and
   every night in the week as well, if you please, and see if you can keep
   up a full congregation," he would fail!

   The people would not come for any length of time and, yet, without any
   great oratory, we preach the Gospel again and again, and the people
   come--they cannot help it! They hear nothing new--it is always the same
   thing over and over again, and yet it is never monotonous! There is
   always a glorious freshness about the Gospel. That one silver bell of
   the Gospel has more melody in it than can be drawn from all the bells
   in all the steeples in the world! There is more sweetness in that one
   name, Jesus, than in all the harps of angels, let alone the music of
   men! When Jesus Christ's Deity is denied in any chapel, it soon becomes
   a howling wilderness. If Christ, the Son of God, is gone, all is gone!
   A certain minister preached Universalism, or the doctrine that
   everybody would be saved in the end, and after a time his chapel became
   empty. His neighbor, who preached that those who did not believe would
   be lost forever, had his house full.

   One day the Universalist met his neighbor, and asked him, "How is it
   that the people come to you when you preach that unbelievers will be
   sent to Hell, and they do not come to me, though I tell them that in
   the end they will all be in Heaven?" The other replied, "They suspect
   that what I tell them is true and that what you tell them is false."
   Where gentlemen of this order have been preaching, people have sense
   enough to come to the conclusion that if what they say is false

   it is not wise to hear them! And if what they say is true there is no
   need to hear them. Certain gentlemen are proving to the world that
   there is no need of themselves, for if men are not lost, what need is
   there of a preacher to tell them how they can be saved? He that cries
   peace and safety, if he is a watchman, might as well hold his tongue.
   If the watchman woke you up in the middle of the night crying out,
   "All's well! A fine starlight night!" you would be very much inclined
   to exclaim, "Why on earth do you go about disturbing people when there
   is nothing the matter? Go home and get to bed with you!"

   And thus these smooth-speaking gentlemen are finding out that they are
   not needed and people are ready to say of them, "Let them go home to
   bed and there let them abide." But on the other hand, if you preach
   Jesus Christ, and even the terrible things of His Word, there will be a
   full house, for conscience bids men hear. When you preach the Gospel,
   souls will be saved! To secure that end, you must stick to the Gospel,
   for that is the one means ordained by God for the conversion of
   sinners. The other day a Gospel minister spoke to a woman who had
   attended certain revival services, in which there was much shouting of,
   "Come to Jesus," but nothing about Jesus. She said, "I heard you preach
   this afternoon, and if what you preached is true, then I am a lost
   woman, and I have been converted 10 times, already." Ah me! What is the
   use of such poor work as this?

   We must teach the King's Word if our work is to be blessed to the
   salvation of souls. We must plow with the Law and let the people know
   what sin means and what repentance means--then we may hopefully sow
   them with the Gospel. Some time ago we were told that there was no need
   of repentance and that repentance only meant a change of mind. But what
   tremendous change of mind true repentance means! Never speak lightly of
   repentance. Then, too, the preaching of the Truth of God--the whole
   Truth of God--will bring a power of union among you, so that you who
   love the Lord will be heartily united. When Christian people quarrel,
   it is generally because they do not get sufficient spiritual food. Dogs
   fight when there are no bones and Church members fall out when there is
   no spiritual food. We must give them plenty of Gospel, for the Gospel
   has the power of sweetening the temper and making us put up with one
   another!

   Preach the King's Word, for it will give you power in private prayer,
   power in the Sunday school, power in the Prayer Meeting, power in
   everything that you do because you will live upon the King's own Word
   and His Word is meat to the soul! The Prophet said, "Your Words were
   found, and I did eat them; and Your Word was unto me the joy and
   rejoicing of my heart." If you try this meat, you will all find it is
   nourishing to you, also. The Lord bless you and grant that it may be
   so. Amen.
