    THE

PREFACE

   THE Substance of the following Pages was first preached in the Parish
   Church at Kidderminster in the Course of the Author's stated Ministry.
   It was afterward preached in one of the largest Parish Churches in
   London, to an Auditory so much crouded, that one Nobleman was obliged
   to stand all the Time; and two others returned back, because they could
   not get within Hearing, tho' Mr. Baxter's Voice was remarkably loud and
   clear; and tho' he himself had sent the Day before to desire Room might
   be provided for his Noble Friend: Even the Incumbent of the Parish had
   no other Place left for him, but to sit in the Pulpit behind the
   Preacher. To this last Circumstance Mr. Baxter refers, in an Elegy
   which he wrote on the Death of that Reverend Brother, inserted amongst
   his Poetical Fragments, wherein he says,

   "At once one Pulpit held us both."

   Here Indifference in Religion is traced up to its real Sources; its
   destructive Nature and Tendency faithfully represented; the best
   Remedies are applied, in Order, by a divine Blessing, to check its
   almost universal Prevalence. With what Propriety and Seriousness does
   the Author's Preface say,--"It is the slighting of Christ and
   Salvation, that undoes the World. O happy Man, Reader, if you escape
   but this Sin! Thousands split their Souls on the Rock, upon which they
   should be built. Look among Rich and Poor, High and Low, Young and Old,
   and see whether it appears not, by the whole Tendency of their
   Conversation, that they value something else more than Christ.
   Notwithstanding the Proclamations of his Grace in the Gospel, and the
   common Profession of being his Disciples, and of believing the glorious
   Things he has promised in another World; does it not appear, by
   Deceitfulness in his Service, by heartless Endeavours to obtain his
   Kingdom, and by busy and delightful Pursuits of the present World, that
   the Generality of such as are called Christians, are really making
   light of Christ? And if so, what Wonder if they perish by their
   Contempt? Will you but seriously read, and well consider as you read,
   till your Heart be sensible what a Sin it is to make light of Christ
   and your own Salvation, and till the Lord that bought you, be advanced
   in the Esteem and Affections of your Soul; this will fulfill my
   Desires."--And this will indeed fulfill the Desires of those who first
   requested this Abridgment, and also, of its Compiler.

CHAP. I.

   What it is to make light of Christ.

   THE blessed Son of God, who thought it not enough to die for the World,
   but would himself also be the Preacher of Grace and Salvation,
   comprizes the Substance of his Gospel in the Parable to which the Text
   belongs. By the King, that is here said to make the Marriage, is meant
   God the Father, who, sent his Son into the World, to cleanse Men from
   their Sins, and espouse them to himself. By the King's Son, for whom
   the Marriage is made, is meant the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son
   of God, who took to his Godhead the Nature of Man, that he might be
   capable of being their Redeemer when they had lost themselves in Sin.
   By the Marriage is meant the uniting of Christ to the Souls of Sinners,
   when he gives up himself to them to be their Saviour, and they give up
   themselves to him, as his redeemed, to be saved and ruled by him. The
   Perfection of this Marriage will be at the Day of Judgment, when the
   Union between Christ and his whole Church shall be publickly
   solemnized. The Word here translated Marriage, rather signifys the
   Marriage Feast, and intimates, that all Men are invited by the Gospel
   to come in and partake of Christ and Salvation, even all the peculiar
   Blessings of Christ's Disciples. The Invitation is from the blessed
   God. The Servants that invite, are the Preachers of the Gospel, who are
   sent by God for that Purpose. The Preparation, for the Feast, is the
   Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and the opening a Way for Sinners to return
   to God. Second Messengers are said to be sent, because God takes not
   the first Denial, but exercises his Patience till Sinners are
   obstinate. The first Persons invited, are theJews. But on their
   obstinate Refusal, and being sentenced to Punishment, the Gentiles are
   invited, and graciously prevailed with to come in. The Number of those
   that come in, is so great, that the House is filled with Guests. .Many
   come sincerely, regarding not only the Pleasure of the Feast, but the
   Honour of the Marriage; not only seeking the Pardon of Sin, and
   Deliverance from divine Wrath, but engaging themselves to Christ in all
   holy Obedience. Some come in only for the Feast, without having the
   Wedding-Garment; they only aim at Self, and not at glorifying, and
   serving their Redeemer. These last are sentenced to everlasting Misery,
   and speed as ill as those that refused to come in at all; for a Faith
   that will not work, is but like that of the Devils; and they that
   expect to be pardoned and saved by such a Faith, are mistaken.

   The Words of the Text describe the bad Entertainment which the Gospel
   finds with many to whom it is sent, even after a first and second
   Invitation. They make light of it, and are taken up with other Things.
   Tho' the Jews were the first that were thus guilty, yet too among us
   Gentiles follow them to this Day. The Text in Effect declares, that
   nowithstanding all the wonderful Love and Mercy God has manifested in
   giving his Son to be the Redeemer of the World, and his Son in giving
   himself, and in being a sufficient Sacrifice for Sin; notwithstanding
   all Christ's personal Excellencies, and the full and glorious Salvation
   he has purchased, and all his free Offers, and frequent and earnest
   Invitations to Sinners; yet many make light of, and despise all this,
   prefer their worldly Enjoyments before it." Not that all do so, or that
   they all continue to do so, who were once guilty of it. God has his
   Chosen, whom he will compel to come in. But till the Spirit of Grace
   overcome the Obstinacy of Men's Hearts, they hear the Gospel as a Tale
   that is told, and the great Things contained in it, are disregarded.
   More distinctly to illustrate the Sentiments of the Text, this Chapter
   will shew what it is to make light of Christ; and (Chap. 2) why Christ
   is made so light of: Then (Chap. 3) will be suggested some
   Considerations to awaken those that make light of Christ; and also
   (Chap. 4) other Considerations to reform them: To which will be added
   (Chap. 5) Directions for those that desire to make light of Christ no
   more.

   That which carnal Hearers make light of, includes in it, Christ
   himself, and the Blessings, which he bestows.--Concerning Christ
   himself, the Gospel declares his Person and Nature, and the great
   Things he has done and suffered for Men, his redeeming us from the
   Wrath of God by his Blood, and purchasing a Grantof Salvation for us.
   The same Gospel makes an Offerof Christ to Sinners, that if they will
   accept him on his easy and reasonable Terms, he will be their Saviour,
   the Physician of their Souls, their Head, and their Husband.--the
   Blessings which Christ bestows upon Sinners, are the Pardon of all
   their past Sins, and Deliverance from the Wrath of God, and a sure Way
   of obtaining Pardon for all the Sins they shall commit hereafter,
   provided they obey sincerely, and turn not again to the Rebellion of
   their unregenerate State. They shall have the Holy Spirit to be their
   Guide and Sanctifier, to dwell in their Souls, to help them against
   their spiritual Enemies, and conform them more and more to a divine
   Likeness, to heal their spiritual Diseases, and bring them back to God.
   They shall, also have a right to everlasting Glory, when this Life is
   ended, and their Bodies shall be raised up to partake of it at the
   great Day. Besides these, they shall have many excellent Priviledges
   and Means, abundant Preservation and Provision in their Way, and the
   Foretaste of their future Joy. All these Blessings the Gospel offers to
   them that will accept of Christ on his reasonable Terms. For this is
   the Record, that God hath given to us eternal Life; and this Life is in
   his Son. He that hath the Son, hath Life, and he that hath not the Son
   of God, hath not Life.

   The Sin of making light of Christ and Salvation appears in the
   following Instances.

   1. When Men take no great Heed to what the Gospel declares, as if it
   was not a certain Truth, or else was a Matter that little concerned
   them, or as if God had not written it for them.

   2. When the Gospel does not affect Men, or go to their Hearts; but tho'
   they seem to attend to what is said, yet they are not awakened by it
   from their Security, nor doth it in any Measure excite such holy
   Emotions in their Souls, as Things of such everlasting Consequence
   ought to do. We tell Men what Christ hath done and suffered for their
   Souls, and it scarce moves them. We tell them of keen and cutting
   Truths, but Nothing will pierce them. We can make them hear, but cannot
   make them feel. Our Words stop in the Porch of their Ears and Fancies,
   but enter not into their inward Parts. It is as if we spake to Men that
   have not Hearts. Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and
   seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive. For the Heart of this
   People is waxed gross, and their Ears are dull of hearing, and their
   Eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their Eyes, and hear
   with their Ears, and understand with their Heart, and should be
   converted, and Christ should heal them.

   3. Men make light of Christ, when they have no high Esteem for him and
   Salvation by him, but whatsoever they may say with their Tongues, or
   may speculatively believe, yet in their serious and practical Thoughts
   they have a higher Esteem for the Things of this World, than they have
   for Christ and the Salvation he hath purchased. It is despising Christ,
   to account his Doctrine but a Question of Words and Names, like Gallio;
   or a Superstition of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to
   be alive, like Festus; or to ask the Preachers of the Gospel, as the
   Athenians did, What will this Babler say?

   Men make light of Christ, when being informed of the Truths of the
   Gospel, on what Terms Christ and his Blessings may be had, how it is
   the Will of God they should believe and accept the Offer, and how he
   commands them to do it upon Pain of Damnation; and yet they will not
   consent, unless they could have Christ on Terms of their own. They will
   not part with their Portion in this World, nor lay down their
   Pleasures, Profits, and Honours at the Feet of Jesus, to be content to
   take only so much of them back, as is consistent with his Will and
   Interest, but think it a hard saying, to be resolved to forsake all for
   Christ. 'Tis a high Contempt Of Christ and everlasting Life, when Men
   might have their Part in him, if they would; but they will not, unless
   they may keep the World too, and are resolved to please their Flesh,
   whatever be the Consequence.

   It is also a making light of Christ and Salvation, when Men will
   promise fair, and profess their Willingness, to have Christ upon his
   own Terms, and to forsake all for him; but they nevertheless cleave to
   the World, and to their sinful Courses, nor will suffer their Practice
   to be changed by all that Christ hath done or said.--This is the Sin of
   making light of Christ and Salvation.

CHAP. II.

   Thy Christ is made so light of.

   IT may seem a Wonder that ever Men, who have the Use of their Reason,
   should be so foolish as to make light of Things of infinite Importance.
   But the Causes are such as these--

   1. Some Men understand not the Meaning of the Words in which the Gospel
   is expressed; and how can they value what they do not understand? Tho'
   we speak to them as plainly as we can, yet they have so estranged
   themselves from God, and the Concerns of their Souls, that they know
   not what we say. It is with them as if God in just Judgment had said,
   With stammering Lips and another Tongue will I speak to this People.

   2. Some understand the Words we speak, but not the Matter, because they
   are carnal. For the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit
   of God, for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can he know them,
   because they are spiritually discerned. The Things of the Spirit are
   not well known by bare Report, but by spiritual Taste, which none have
   but those that are taught by the Spirit which is of God, that we might
   know the Things that are freely given to us of God.

   .3.. Carnal Minds apprehend not a Suitableness in these spiritual and
   heavenly Things, and therefore set light by them. Tell them of
   everlasting Glory, and they hear you, as if you, as if you was
   persuading them to go and play with the Sun. The Affairs of another
   World are out of their Element, and therefore they have no more Delight
   in them, than a Fish would have in the pleasantest Meadow, or a Swine
   in a Jewel. They that are after the Spirit, may mind the Things of the
   Spirit; but they that are after the Flesh, do mind the Things of the
   Flesh.

   4. The chief Cause of slighting Christ and Salvation, is a secret Root
   of Unbelief. Whatsoever Men may pretend, they do not really believe the
   Word of God. They are taught in general to say, the Gospel is true; but
   they never saw the Evidence of its Truth, so as to be firmly persuaded
   of it; nor have they got their Souls settled on the Infallibility of
   God's Testimony; nor have they considered the Truth of the particular
   Doctrines revealed in Scripture. O Sinners, did you but really believe
   the Gospel Account of the Evil of Sin, of your Need of Christ, and what
   he hath done for you, and what you must be, and do; if ever you are
   saved by him, and what will become of you for ever, if you remain in
   Disobedience; 1 dare say this would cure the Contempt of Christ, and
   you would not make so light of your own Salvation! But Men do not
   believe, while they say so, and even while they themselves think so.
   There is in them an evil Heart of Unbelief, which makes them depart
   from the living God. Tell any Man he shall have a Gift of ten Thousand
   Pounds, if he will but go some Miles for it; if he believes you; he
   will go; if he believes not, he will not go. And if he will not go,
   supposing her is able, you may be sure he does not believe. I know a
   slight Belief may consist with a wicked Life; but a sincere Belief is
   inconsistent with so great Neglect of the Things that are believed.

   5. Christ and Salvation are made light of, because of Men's Hardness of
   Heart. The Heart is naturally hard, and grows harder by Custom in Sin,
   especially by long Abuse of Mercy, Neglect of the Means of Grace, and
   resisting the Spirit of Grace. Hence it is that Men are turned into
   such Stones. And till God cure them of the Stone in the Heart, no
   Wonder if they feel not what they know, .nor regard what Preachers say,
   but make light of all. 'Tis hard preaching a Stone into Tears, or
   making a Rock to tremble. When Men's Hearts are like the Highway, that
   is trodden to Hardness; or like the Clay, that is hardened in the Fire;
   when no Mercies can melt them to Repentance; when they have Consciences
   seared with a hot Iron; then it is no Wonder if they be past Feeling,
   and work all Uncleanness with Greediness, so as to make light of Christ
   and everlasting Glory. O that this were not the Case of too many of our
   Hearers ! Had we but living Souls to speak to, they would hear, and
   feel, and not make light of what we say. I know they are naturally
   alive, but they are dead in Trespasses and Sins. Were there but one
   Spark of the Life of Grace in them, the Doctrine of Salvation, by Jesus
   Christ would appear to them to be the weightiest Business in the World.
   O how confident should I be to prevail with Men, to mind the Concerns
   of Eternity more than Time, if they had but Life, and Sense, and
   Reason! How deplorable is the Condition of their Souls, who are fallen
   under this fearful Judgment of spiritual Deadness, and Blindness, and
   Hardness of Heart!

   6. Multitudes make light of Christ and Salvation, because they are
   wholly sensual. The Concerns of another World are out of Sight, and so
   far from their Senses, that they cannot regard them; but present Things
   are in their Eyes, and in their Hands. There must be a living Faith to
   prevail over Sense, before unseen Things will be duly regarded. Sense
   works with great Advantage, and therefore powerfully opposes Faith,
   where Faith itself is found; and no Wonder if it carries all before it,
   where there is no true and lively Faith to resist it, and to lead the
   Soul to higher Things. They, in the Text, who made light of Christ and
   Salvation, went their Ways, as it is added, one to his Farm, another to
   his Merchandise. Men have Houses and Lands to look after, Wife and
   Children, Body and outward Estate, and therefore they forget that they
   have a God, a Redeemer, a Soul to mind. These worldly Things are near
   at Hand, and therefore work naturally and forcibly; but the other are
   thought to be a great Way off, and therefore too distant to work on
   their Affections. Their Bodies have Life and Sense, and therefore if
   they want Meat, or Drink, or Cloaths, will feel their Wants, and make
   them known, and never rest till they are supplied. Men cannot make
   light of their bodily Necessities; but their Souls being spiritually
   dead, are insensible of their Wants, and will therefore be as quiet,
   when starving and languishing to Destruction, as if all were well and
   Nothing ailed them. Thus poor People are so attentive to their bodily
   Wants, as if they had Nothing else to mind; having their Trades and
   Callings to follow, and so much to do from Morning to Night, they can
   find no Tune for Christ and Salvation. Jesus would teach them, but they
   have no Leisure to hear him. The Bible is before them, but they cannot
   spare Time to read it. A Minister is in the Town with them, but they
   cannot go to ask him, What must we do to be saved? And when they do
   hear, their Hearts are so full of the World, they cannot mind what they
   hear, nor is there any Room to pour into them the Waters of Life. The
   Cares of the World choke the Word, and it becometh unfruitful. No Man
   can serve two Masters, God and Mammon. If any Man love the World, the
   Love of the Father is not in him. Men will set light by Christ and
   Salvation, while they so highly value any Thing upon Earth. This is the
   Ruin of many Thousand Souls! It would grieve the Heart of any serious
   Christian, to see how eagerly this vain World is every where followed,
   and the World to come neglected. To compare the Care Men take fur the
   World, with the Care of their Souls; and the Time they spend about the
   World, with the Time they employ for their Salvation. To see how the
   World fills their Mouths, their Hands, their Houses, their Hearts,
   while Christ hath little more than a bare Title of Respect. To come
   into their Company, and hear no Discourse but of the World. To come
   into their Houses, and hear and see Nothing but for the World, as if
   this World would last for ever, or would purchase them another. If I
   ask the Ministers of the Gospel how their Labours succeed? They tell
   me, "People continue still the same, and give up themselves wholly to
   the World, so that they mind not what we say to them, nor will give a
   full Entertainment to the Word: and all because of the deluding World."
   And O that too many Ministers themselves did not make light of that
   Christ whom they preach, thro' being drawn away by the Love if this
   World! In a Word, Men of a worldly Disposition judge of Things
   according to worldly Advantages. Thus Christ is despised and rejected
   of Men, they hide as it were their Faces from him, and esteem him not,
   they see no Form, nor Comeliness, nor Beauty, that they should desire
   him.

   7. Inconsideration is another Cause why Men make light of Christ. They
   do not soberly attend to the Truth and Importance of Soul-Concerns.
   They suffer not their Minds to dwell so long upon them, till they
   procure a due Esteem, and deeply affect their Hearts. If these Things
   are assented to, but not closely considered, how should they have their
   proper Influence? While Men have Reason given them to think and
   consider of the Things that most concern them, and yet they will not
   see it, this occasions their making light of such Things, and treating
   them with Contempt.

   . 8. Christ and Salvation, are made light of, because Men remain
   insensible of their Sin and Misery. Their Eyes were never opened to see
   themselves as they are; nor their Hearts truly humbled in the Sense of
   their own Wretchedness. If this were done, they would soon be brought
   to value a Saviour. A Heart broken for Sin can no more make light of
   Christ and Salvation, than a hungry Man of his Food, or a sick Man of
   his Physician. When Sin and Guilt are groaned under, as an intolerable
   Burthen, then Nothing will serve the Turn but Christ. Till Men are
   deeply humbled, they can part with Christ and Salvation for a Lust, for
   a little worldly Gain, for that which is less than Nothing. But when
   God hath inlightened their Consciences, and broken their Hearts, then
   they would give a World for Christ; then they count all Things but Loss
   for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus their Lord. When
   they are once pricked in their Hearts for their Sin and Misery, then
   they cry out, Men and Brethren, what shall we do? When they are
   awakened by the Word or Providence of God, then they will ask with the
   Jailor, Sirs, what must we do to be saved? Thus God will bring Men low
   by Humiliation, before he bring them to Salvation.

   9. Men take occasion to make light of Christ, because the Gospel is
   grown common to them. They hear of it every Day, and the Frequency
   dulls their Affections. Were it a Rarity, it might be more regarded;
   but now they plead, "We have these Things every Day." They make not
   light of their Meat and Drink, their Health or Life, because they
   possess them every Day. They make not light of the Sun, because it
   shines every Day; at least they should not, for the Mercy is the
   greater by its Constancy. Yet Christ and Salvation are made light of,
   because they hear of them often. Pearls are trod in the Dirt, where
   they are common. The heavenly Manna is counted dry. The full Soul
   loatheth an Honey-Comb, but to the hungry Soul every bitter Thing is
   sweet.----Once more;

   10. Christ is made light of, either because Men think he is theirs
   already, or because he may easily be theirs at any Time. It is true,
   that Grace is free, and the Offer is universal, where-ever the Gospel
   is preached. And it is true, that Men may have Christ whenever they are
   willing to comply with his Terms. But if you are not willing now, how
   can you think you shall be willing hereafter? If you can make your own
   Heart willing, why not do it immediately? Can you do it better, when
   Sin hath more hardened it, and God may have given you over to yourself?
   O Sinners, you might do much, tho' you are not able of yourselves to
   come in; if you would but now subject yourselves to the Working of the
   Spirit, and set in while the Gales of Grace continue! Did you know what
   a hard Thing it is to be so much as willing to have Christ and Grace;
   when the Heart is given up to its own corrupt Bias, and the Spirit hath
   withdrawn its former Influences, you would not be so confident of your
   own Strength to believe and repent, nor would you from such foolish
   Confidence continue to make light of Christ. If indeed it be so easy a
   Matter, as you imagine, for a Sinner to believe and repent at any Time,
   how comes it to pass that it is done by so few, while Multitudes perish
   in their Impenitence, amidst all desireable Helps and Means? It must be
   allowed that the Thing is very reasonable and easy in itself to a pure
   Nature; but while Man is spiritually blind and dead, the Things are
   scarcely possible to him, which are ever so easy to others. To gracious
   Souls, it is the easiest and sweetest Life in the World, to live in the
   Love of God, and the Thoughts of that Life to come, where all their
   Hope and Happiness lieth. But it is as easy to remove Mountains, as to
   bring carnal Hearts to this. These Men however condemn themselves; for
   if they think it so easy a Matter to repent, and believe, and so have
   Christ and Salvation, they have then the less Excuse for neglecting
   what they thought so easy. O miserable impenitent Souls! What think you
   to reply, when God shall ask you, "Why did you not repent, and "love
   your Redeemer above the World, when you imagined you could easily do it
   at any Time?"

   Are such as these the Causes why Multitudes make light of Christ and
   Salvation? How great then is the Folly, and how contemptible are the
   Judgments of all carnal Men, and how little need have we to be
   discouraged by their Sneers or Insults! That Man must be foolish or
   mad, that knows no Difference between Dirt and Gold. And it is the
   Height of Folly and Madness, to set light by Christ and Salvation, and
   be daily toiling for the Dirt of this World. And yet how lamentably
   prone are many weak Persons to be ashamed of Godliness, if such Fools
   or Madmen do but deride them for it; and to think hardly of a holy
   Life, if such as these do but rail at it! On the contrary, if you
   perceive any setting light by Christ and Salvation, let their Wisdom
   and Words be light in your Esteem, and hear their Reproaches of a holy
   Life with the tender Compassion with which you would hear the Ravings
   of a Madman.

   Are the best Ministers of the Gospel despised, and do they complain of
   the ill Success of their Labours? Wonder not, since the Ministry of
   Apostles succeeded no better, tho' they had Miracles to second their
   Doctrines. If any Preachers could have shaken and torn in Pieces the
   Hearts of Sinners, they could have done it. If any could have made all
   cry out, as some did, What shall we do? it would have been Apostles. It
   is not therefore for Want of good Preachers, that Men make light of
   Christ and Salvation. The first News of Pardon for Sin, and the Hope of
   Glory, and the Danger of everlasting Misery, would turn the Hearts of
   Men within them, if they were as tractable in spiritual Matters, as in
   temporal. But, alas! it is far otherwise. Let it not seem strange to
   Ministers, nor let them be too much discouraged by it, if, when they
   have said all that they can desire in Order to win the Hearts of Men to
   Christ, the greatest Part still slight him, and tho' they bow the Knee
   to him, and honour him with their Lips, yet basely prefer every worldly
   and carnal Pleasure or Profit before him. While it it thus with many,
   blessed be God, it is not thus with all.

   But before we, that are Ministers, enquire after this great condemning
   Sin amongst our Hearers, we should take Care that we be not guilty of
   it ourselves. God forbid, that having undertaken the sacred Office of
   revealing the Excellencies of Christ to the World, we should make light
   of him ourselves, and slight that Salvation which we daily preach. The
   Lord knows we are all of us so defective in our Esteem for Christ, and
   do our great Work so negligently, that we have Reason to be ashamed of
   our best Sermons; but should this Sin prevail in us, we are of all Men
   most miserable. I love not Censoriousness, Brethren; yet I dare not
   befriend so vile a Sin in myself, or others, under Pretence of avoiding
   it; especially when there is so great a Necessity first to heal it in
   us, who make it our Business to heal it in others. O that there were no
   Cause to complain that Christ is made light of by those that preach
   him!--Are not Studies neglected?--Are not Ministrations lifeless and
   formal?--How little is done out of the Pulpit, for reproving Sin, and
   saving Men's Souls?--Is there not a perpetual Neglect of those Things
   in which the Interest of Christ consists; even the healing. reforming,
   and enlarging his Churches?--Are not many made Preachers before they
   are Christians, and therefore, by their own covetous and worldly Lives,
   lose the most precious Advantages for doing good to Souls? If such
   Ministers believe the Scriptures which they preach, methinks their
   studying and preaching should fill them with Terror.

CHAPT. III.

   Considerations to awaken those who make light of Christ.

   THE Office God hath called me unto, is, by declaring the Glory of his
   Grace, to help under Christ to the saving of Men's Souls. I hope, my
   dear Readers, you think I am now engaged on no other Errand. The Lord
   knows I had not set Pen to Paper, but in Hope to succeed in this Work
   for your Souls. I have considered, and often considered, why so many
   Thousands should perish, when God hath done so much for their
   Salvation; and I find that which is mentioned in my Text, is the Cause.
   It is one of the Wonders of the World, that when God hath so loved the
   World as to give his Son, and Christ hath made a Satisfaction by his
   Death sufficient for all, and offereth the Benefits of it so freely to
   all, even without Money, and without Price, that nevertheless most of
   the World, should perish; yea, most of those that are thus called by
   his Word. Here is the Reason; when Christ hath done all this; Men make
   light of it. God hath shewed that he is not unwilling, and Christ hath
   shewed that he is not unwilling, that Men should be restored to divine
   Favour, and be saved; but Men are themselves actually unwilling. God
   hath no Pleasure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn
   from his Way and live. But Men take such Pleasure in Sin, that they
   will die before they will turn. The Lord Jesus was content to be their
   Physician, and hath provided them a sufficient Remedy, even his own
   Blood; but if Men make light of it, and will not apply it, what Wonder
   if they perish after all? It is a most lamentable Thing to see how most
   Men spend their Care, their Time, their Pains for known Vanities, while
   God and Glory are cast aside! That he who is All, should seem to them
   as Nothing; and that which is Nothing, should seem to them as good as
   All! That God should set Mankind in such a Race, where Heaven or Hell
   is their certain End, and that they should sit down, and loiter, or run
   after the childish Toys of this World; and so much forget the Prize
   they should run for! Were it but possible for one of us to see the
   whole of this Business, as the All-feeing God does; to see at one View
   both Heaven and Hell, to which Men are so near, and see what most Men
   in the World are minding, and what they are doing every Day, it would
   be the saddest Sight that could be imagined. O how should we wonder at
   their Madness, and mourn over their Self-Delusion! O poor distracted
   World! What is it that you run after? And what is it that you neglect?
   If God had never told them what they were sent into the World to do, or
   whither they were going, or what was before them in another World, then
   they had been cxcuseable; but he hath told them over and over, till
   they are weary of it. Had he left it doubtful, there had been some
   Excuse; but it is his sealed Word, and they profess to believe it, and
   would take it ill of us if we should question whether they do believe
   it or not.

   I accuse not any particular Persons of this Crime; but seeing, it is
   Abe most common Cause of Men's Destruction, I suppose you will judge it
   the fittest Matter for our Enquiry, and that the Cure of it deserves
   our greatest Care. Now it is the Case of most Sinners to think
   themselves freest from those Sins to which they are most enslaved. And
   one Reason why we cannot reform them, is, because we cannot convince
   them of their Guilt. It is the Nature of Sin so far to blind and
   stupify the Sinner, that he knows not what he does, but thinks he is
   free from it, when it reigns in him, or when he is committing it. It
   brings Men to be so much unacquainted with themselves, that they know
   not what they think, what they mean and intend, nor what they love or
   hate, much, less what they are disposed or habituated to. They are
   alive to Sin, and dead to all the Reason, Consideration, and Resolution
   that should recover them; as if it were only by their Sinning that we
   must know they are alive. May I hope that you who now read, are but
   willing to know the Truth of your Case, and then I shall be encouraged
   to proceed to an Enquiry. God will judge impartially. And why should
   not we do so? Let me therefore by these following Questions try whether
   you are not Slighters of Christ and your own Salvation. And follow me,
   I beseech you, by putting them close to your own Hearts, and faithfully
   answering them.

   1. Things that Men highly value, will be remembered, and will be the
   Matter of their freest and sweetest Thoughts. Do not those then make
   light of Christ and Salvation, who think of them so seldom and coldly,
   in Comparison with other Things? Follow thy own Heart, Man, and observe
   what it daily runs out after; and then judge whether it makes light of
   Christ. We cannot persuade Men to one Hour's sober Consideration what
   they should do for an Interest in Christ, or in Thankfulness for his
   Love, and yet they will not believe that they make light of him.

   2. Things that we highly value, will be Matter of our Discourse. The
   Judgment and Heart will command the Tongue. Freely and delightfully
   will our Speech run after them. Do not those then make light of Christ
   and Salvation, that shun the Mention of his Name, unless it be in a
   vain or sinful Manner? And those that love not the Company where Christ
   and Salvation are much talked of, but think it .troublesome, and had
   rather hear some merry Jests, or idle Tales or talk of their worldly
   Affairs? If from Morning to Night they scarce speak a serious Word of
   Christ, judge whether they do not make light of him. O how earnestly do
   they talk of the World, and speak Vanity; but how heartlessly of Christ
   and Salvation!

   3. The Things we highly value, we desire to secure to ourselves, and
   therefore do any Thing requisite to put them out of all Doubt and Fear.
   Do not those then make light of Christ and Salvation, who :have lived
   twenty or thirty Years in Uncertainty about their Interest in them, and
   never seek to have their Doubts resolved? Are you certain you shall be
   saved? O that you were! If you had not made light of Salvation; you
   could not have rested till you had made it sure, or done your best to
   make it so. Is there none to enquire of, to help you in such a Work?
   You have Ministers appointed to that Office; have you gone to them, and
   told them the Doubtfulness of your Case, and intreated their Help in
   judging of your Condition? Alas, Ministers may sit in their Studies
   from Year to Year, before ten Persons in a Thousand come to them on
   such an Errand! And do not the Generality therefore make light of
   Christ?

   4. The Things we value, deeply affect us, and our Hearts will be moved
   according to our Esteem for them. If Men did not make light of
   spiritual and eternal Things, how would their Hearts work, when they
   hear or read of them?What strong Affections, what Melting of Heart,
   what Sorrow for Sin, what Astonishment in the View of their Misery,
   what Joy at the Tidings of Salvation by Christ, what Resolution on the
   Discovery of their Duty, would they be conscious to? What should we
   have, if it were not for this Sin? Whereas now we are more likely to
   weary them, fill them with Disgust, or lull them asleep, with Things of
   this unspeakable Importance: By their Carelessness, one would imagine
   they were not the Persons spoken to.

   5. Our Estimation of Things will appear in our diligent Endeavours.
   What we most value, we shall think no Pains too great to obtain. Do not
   those then make light of Christ and Salvation, who think any Thing too
   much which they do for Christ, who murmur at his Service; and think it
   grievous, and say, "This is more than needs?" For the World, they will
   labour all the Day, and all their Lives; but for Christ and Salvation,
   they are afraid of doing too much. Let us preach to them ever so long,
   we cannot bring them to relish and resolve upon a Life of Holiness. In
   their Houses, you shall not hear them read a Chapter, or pray with
   their Families once a Day; nor will they allow God one Day in Seven, as
   he requires; but Pleasure, or worldly Business, or Idleness must have a
   Part. Many of them are even so far hardened, as to reproach all who
   will not be as mad as themselves. And is not Christ worth seeking? Is
   not everlasting Salvation worth more than all our Diligence in Duty?
   Let common Sense judge, if that Soul makes not light of Christ and
   Salvation, who prefers his Ease before them.

   6. That which we most highly value, we think we cannot buy too dear.
   Christ and Salvation are freely given, and yet most Men go without
   them, because they cannot enjoy them and the present World together.
   They are only called to part with that which would hinder them from
   Christ, and they will not do it. They are called only to give God his
   own; and to reign all to his Will; and to forsake the Pleasures and
   Profits of this World, when they must either part with Christ or them;
   and they will not. They think this too dear a Bargain, and plead, "We
   cannot spare these Things. We must look to our Estates. We must keep up
   our Credit with Men; how else shall we live? We must have our Pleasure,
   whatever becomes of Christ and Salvation." As if they were afraid of
   being Losers by Christ, or thought a Man would be profited, if he
   should gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul. Christ has solemnly
   declared, that whosoever forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be his
   Disciple. Far are those Men from forsaking all for Christ, and yet they
   would have it thought that they are his Disciples indeed.

   7. That which Men highly esteem, they are desirous to help their
   Friends to, as well as themselves. .And do not these Men make light of
   Christ and Salvation, who can take so much Care to leave their Children
   Portions on Earth, but do so little to help them to Heaven? Who provide
   outward Necessaries for their Families, but do Nothing for saving their
   Souls? Their neglected Children and Friends will testify, that Christ
   was made light of, or the Souls of Children and Friends would have been
   tenderly and faithfully regarded.

   8. That which Men highly esteem, they will manifest by their
   successfully pursuing, if it be attainable. You may see how many make
   light of Christ, by the little Knowledge they have of him, and their
   little Communion with him, and their having no Graces communicated from
   him. Alas, how many Ministers can speak it with Sorrow of Heart, that
   many of their People know almost Nothing of Christ, tho' they hear of
   him daily! They know not what they must do to be saved! And if we ask
   them an Account of these Things, they answer as if they understood not
   what we say, and tell us they are no Scholars, and therefore think
   their Ignorance will excuse them. If such Persons had not made light of
   Christ and Salvation, but had bestowed half as much Pains to know and
   enjoy the Lord, as they have done to understand their Trades and
   Affairs in the World, they would not have been so ignorant as they are.
   When Men in a few Years have learned a difficult Trade; but, perhaps in
   twenty or thirty, have not learned any easy Catechism, or the Meaning
   of their Creed, nor will bear to be examined about such Things; does
   not this shew that they have slighted them in their Hearts? How will
   these Despisers of Christ be able in the great Day to look him in the
   Face, and give an Account of these Neglects!

   After having suggested these Things for your Conviction, do not some of
   your Consciences by this Time smite you, and say, "I am the Man who
   have made light of my Salvation?" If Conscience does not say so, it is
   because you still make light of it, notwithstanding all that has been
   said to you.

CHAP. IV.

   Considerations to reform those, who make light of Christ.

   FAIN would I have this damning Distemper cured, if it be the. Will of
   the Lord; and therefore I am very unwilling to leave you, Sinners, in
   such a desperate Condition; did I but know how to remedy it. I will now
   add some Considerations, which may move you to look better about you.
   If you are Men of Reason and Understanding, I beseech you weigh them,
   and make a faithful Use of them: lay open your Hearts to the Work of
   Grace, and seriously survey the dismal Case you are in, if you are
   really such as make light of Christ.

   1. Consider you make light of him, who did not make light of you, tho'
   you deserved to be so treated by him. You were worthy of Nothing but
   Contempt. As Men, what are you but Worms to God? As Sinners you are far
   more vile than Toads. Yet Christ was so far from making light of you,
   and of your Happiness, that he humbled himself to put on mortal Flesh,
   lived a Life of Suffering, and offered himself a Sacrifice to the
   Justice which you had provoked, that your miserable Souls might have a
   Remedy. No less hath he shewed to us than Miracles of Love and Mercy,
   and yet shall we slight them? Angels, whom they less concern, desire to
   look into them; and shall redeemed Sinners make light of them? What
   more than devilish Ingratitude is this? The Devils never had a Saviour
   offered to them, but you have; and do you yet make light of him

   2. Consider, the Work of Man's Salvation by Jesus Christ is the
   Master-Piece of all the Works of God, in which he designs his Love and
   Mercy to be magnified, as his Wisdom and Power were in Creation. For
   this Reason the Name of Jesus is Wonderful. Greater Love could none
   shew than this. How great was the Evil and Misery from which he
   delivered us and the Good he procured for us? All are Wonders, from his
   Birth to his Ascension. And from our new Birth to our Entrance into our
   Masters Joy, All are Wonders of matchless Mercy. And do you make light
   of them?

   3. Confider, the Things you make light of are the most excellent and of
   the highest Importance. You slight you know not what. Had you well
   known, you could not have done it. If thou hadst known the Gift of God,
   and who it is that speaks to thee, thou wouldst have asked of him, and
   he would have given thee living Water; as our Lord argued with the
   Woman of Samaria. Had the Princes of this World known it, they would
   not have crucified the Lord of Glory. So had you known what Christ is,
   you would not have made light of him. Had you but seen what they
   possess in Heaven, and also what Miseries they endure who are shut out,
   you would never afterwards have made so light of Christ. O Sirs! the
   Gospel treats not of Things trifling, or to be jested with. I profess
   to you, when I have the most serious Thoughts of those Things, I am
   ready to wonder the Souls of Men are not overwhelmed with them; that
   the Greatness of the Subject does not even drive Men besides
   themselves; and especially, that Men should be so stupid, as to make
   light of them. O Lord, that Men did but know what everlasting Glory,
   and everlasting Torments are! Would they then hear, and read, and think
   of these Things as they do? Could they forbear crying out in the
   Congregation, or rest till they have gone to their Minister, and
   learned what they should do to be saved, that this great Business might
   be put out of Doubt? Amazing, that an everlasting Heaven and Hell
   should work no more on Men! How can you forbear thinking, when you are
   alone, what it is to be everlastingly in Joy or Torment ? Why do not
   such Thoughts break your Sleep, and interrupt you in the Midst of your
   Labours? How can you have any Peace in your Minds? How can you eat, or
   drink, or sleep, till you have got some Ground of everlasting
   Consolations? Is that a Man, or a Corps, that is not affected with
   these momentous Things? That can sleep, rather than tremble, when he
   hears how he must stand at the Bar of God? That can follow his worldly
   Business, and make Nothing of the Business of Salvation or Damnation,
   even tho' he knows it is near at Hand?--Truly I wonder at the very best
   of God's Saints upon Earth, that they are no better, and do no more in
   so weighty an Affair. I wonder at those, whom the World accounts more
   holy than needs; and despises for making too much ado; that they do so
   little for Christ and their Souls; that they pour not out their Souls
   in every Supplication; that they are not more taken up with God and
   that their Thoughts are not more serious in Preparation for their last
   Account. I wonder they are not a hundred Times more strict in their
   Lives, and more laborious and unwearied in their striving for the
   Crown.--As for myself, I am ashamed of my dull and careless Heart, of
   my slow and unprofitable Course of Life, and of every Sermon I preach,
   to think what I have been speaking of, and who sent me, and how much
   the Salvation or Damnation of Men is concerned in it. I am ready to
   tremble, lest God should judge me as a Slighter of his Word; and of the
   Souls of Men, and lest in the best Sermon I should be guilty of their
   Blood. Methinks we should not speak a Word to Men, in Matters of such
   Consequence, without Tears, or without the greaten possible
   Earnestness; and we do not so, because we are too much guilty of the
   Sin which we reprove.

   5. Confider who it is that sends this weighty Message to you. Is it not
   God himself? Shall the God of Heaven speak, and Men make light of it?
   You would not slight the Voice of an Angel or a Prince.

   Confider whose Salvation you make light of. Is it not your own? Are you
   no more near or dear to yourselves, than to make light of your own
   Happiness or Misery? Are you in no Care whether you shall be saved or
   damned? Is Self Love lost? Are you turned your own Enemies? As he that
   slights his Food, slights his Life; so if you slight Christ, whatsoever
   you may think, you will find it was your own Salvation that you
   slighted. It is Christ who says, All they that hate me, love Death.

   6. Confider how it aggravates your Sin in making light of the Gospel,
   that you profess to believe it. It is no Wonder a professed Infidel
   should make light of it, who neither believes that Christ ever died, or
   rose again, or that there is a Heaven or Hell. But you inexcusable, who
   make it your Creed and and Religion, call yourselves Christians, have
   been baptised into into this Faith, and seem to stand to it. What!
   believe that you shall live in endless joy or Torment, and yet make so
   light of escaping Torment, and obtaining Joy! What! believe that God
   will shortly judge you, and yet treat Preparation for it with
   Indifference! Either say plainly, "I am no Christian. I do not believe
   these wonderful Things. I will believe Nothing but what I see." Or else
   let your Hearts be affected with your Belief, and live as you say you
   believe, when you repeat the Creed, and mention Christ's Coming to
   Judgment, and the Life everlasting.

   7. Confider what those Things are which you prefer before Christ and
   Salvation. Have you found a better Friend, or a greater and surer
   Happiness? Good God! What Dung is all that Men make so much of, while
   they let light by eternal Blessedness? What Joys are they daily taken
   up with, while Matters of Life and Death are neglected? Had you every
   One a Kingdom in your Hopes, what were it, compared with an everlasting
   Kingdom? What is all the Glory and Dignity of this World, all its Lands
   and Lordships, its Crowns and Kingdoms, but like some poor Creature,
   that borrows fine Cloths, and mimicks the Part of a King on a Stage,
   and after a few Minutes comes down, and is stript of all his Finery?
   Were it not for God's Interest in the Authority of Magistrates, and the
   Service they might do him, all their Glory is but a Vapour. Death
   levels all. What Difference is there at Judgment, between your having
   been a rich Man or a poor Man; a Dives or a Lazarus? O that Men knew
   what a fleeting Shadow they catch at, while they neglect the
   everlasting Substance? The most powerful, rich, and prosperous Sinners
   only lay in Fuel for their Sorrows, while they are fancying it will
   will be a Treasure of Enjoyments. Alas, they are dreaming of Happiness,
   and when they awake, what a Change will they find! Their Crown is made
   of Thorns. Their Joy has such a Sting, as will pierce their Heart thro'
   all Eternity, except unfeigned Repentance prevent. O how sadly will
   these Wretches be convinced e'er long, what a foolish Bargain they
   made, in selling Christ and Salvation for these Trifles! Let your Farms
   and Merchandize then save you, if they can; and do that for you which
   Christ would have done. Cry then to your Baal to save you.

   8. Consider that to set light by Christ and Salvation is a certain Sign
   you have no Part in them. If you continue to do so, Christ will set as
   light by you. Them that honour him, he will honour; and they that
   despise him, shall be lightly esteemed. You will feel one Day, that you
   cannot live without him. You will then confess your Need of him. And
   then you may look for a Saviour where you will, for he will be no
   Saviour to you, who refused to value him, and submit to him, while he
   was offered to you. Then who will be the Loser by your Contempt? O what
   will it be for a poor miserable Soul to cry to Christ for Help in the
   Day of Extremity, and to hear him say, "Thou didst set light by me in
   the Day of thy Prosperity, and I will now set as light by thee in thy
   Adversity. Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out
   my Hand, and no Man regarded; But you have set at Nought all my
   Counsel, and would none of my Reproof; I also will laugh at your
   Calamity, I will mock when your Fear cometh, when your Fear cometh as
   Desolation, and your Destruction cometh as a Whirlwind; when Distress
   and Anguish come upon you. Then shall you call upon on me, but I will
   not answer; you shall seek me early, but you shall not find me. For you
   hated Knowledge; and did not chuse the Fear of the Lord. You would none
   of my Counsel, you despised all my Reproof. Therefore shall you eat of
   the Fruit of your own Way, and be filled with your own Devices. You
   that, as Esau, for one Morsel of Meat sold your Birthright, shall then
   find no Place for Repentance, tho' you seek it carefully with Tears."
   Do you think that Christ shed his Blood to save them who continue to
   make light of it, and that prefer their Lusts before his Salvation?
   Tho' you set so light by Christ and Salvation, God does not do so. He
   values the Blood of his Son, and everlasting Glory, and will make you
   value them, if ever you have them. All the World cannot save him who
   sets light by Christ. And can you find Fault for being denied what you
   yourselves made light of, and for missing the Salvation which you
   slighted?

   9. Consider, the Time is near when Christ and Salvation will no more be
   made light of, as they now are.. When God hath shaken your careless
   Soul out of your Body, and you must answer for all your Sins in your
   own Name; O then, what would you give for a Saviour! When a Thousand
   Bills shall be brought against you, and not one to relieve you, you
   will then reflect, "Now would Christ have stood between me and the
   Wrath of God! Had Is not despised him, he would have answered every
   Demand!" When you see the World hath left you, your Companions in Sin
   have deceived both themselves and you, and that all your merry Days are
   fled away; then, what would you give for the Christ and Salvation,
   which you now account not worth your Labour? When you shall see the
   Judgment-Day, and yourselves doomed to everlasting Perdition for your
   Wickedness, do you think you shall then make as light of Christ, as you
   do now? Why will you not judge now, as you know you shall judge then?
   Will Christ then be worth ten Thousand Worlds, and is he not now worth
   your highest Esteem, and your best Affections!

   10. Consider, God will not only deny you the Salvation you made light
   of, but he will take from you all that which you preferred before it.
   He that loves Christ in Sincerity, shall with him have all Things, so
   far as here they will be for his good; and have Christ hereafter, when
   earthly Enjoyments shall have lost all their Value. He that esteems any
   Thing here more than Christ, shall have his Comforts on Earth
   imbittered to him, and be left comfortless for ever and ever.

   And what think you now? Does it not appear by these Considerations to
   be a heinous Sin to make light of Christ and Salvation? Ought you not
   to be careful lest this should prove your own wretched Condition? God
   knows it is too common. Whoever is found guilty at last of this Sin,
   good were it for that Man if he had never been born. He had better have
   been a Turk or a Savage, that never heard the Name of a Saviour, nor
   ever had the Offer of Salvation. Christ, whom you make light of, must
   be your Judge, and for this Sin will he judge you. And as Christ
   himself asks, how can you escape the Damnation of Hell? Or, as the
   Apostle asks, how shall you escape if you neglect so great Salvation?
   Can you escape without a Christ; or will a despised Christ then save
   you ? If he be cursed that setteth light by his Father, or his Mother;
   what then is he that setteth light by Christ? It is among the
   aggravated Sins of Jerusalem, that in her were those who set light by
   Father and Mother, but how much more aggravated to set light by the
   Father of Spirits? In the Name of God I beseech you to consider, how
   you will bear his final Displeasure, whom you now make light of. You
   that cannot make light of a little Sickness, or Want, or even of a
   Tooth-Ach, but groan as if you were undone; how can you make light of
   the Fury of the Lord, which will burn against the Contemners of his
   Grace? Is it not absolutely necessary to think of these Things before
   it be for ever too late?

CHAP. V.

   Directions for those who desire to make light of Christ no more.

   HAVING endeavoured to convince you of the Evil and Danger of this Sin,
   I now come to know what you are resolved, upon. What says Conscience?
   Will you set as light by Christ and Salvation, as you have formerly
   been doing? Are you resolved still to persist in the same sinful
   Course? I hope not. O let not your Ministers, who would fain save you,
   be brought Witnesses against you to condemn you. At least, I beseech
   you, put not this upon me. If the Lord than say to us at Judgment, "Did
   you never tell these Men what Christ hath done and suffered for their
   Souls, and their own need of him, and how nearly it concerned them to
   regard their own Salvation, and not make light of it?" We must then
   say, "Yes, Lord, we told them of it as plainly as we could. We would
   have done it upon our Knees to them, if we had thought thereby to have
   prevailed. We intreated them as earnestly as we could to consider these
   Things. They heard of these Things every Day; but alas, we could never
   fasten them on their Hearts! They gave us the Hearing, but they made
   light of all that we could say to them." How wretched will your
   Condition be, if you force us to such an Answer as this!

   Perhaps you may be secretly hoping that you are not in the Number of
   those who make light of Christ. And for fear you should deceive
   yourselves with false Hopes, let me excite your Caution and Jealousy by
   mentioning some of those Things on which false Hopes are commonly
   founded. As for Instance;--You may have a notional and speculative
   Knowledge of Christ, and of the Necessity of his Blood, and of the
   Excellency of Salvation; and yet may perish as Neglecters of Christ.
   This is too common amongst professing Christians.---You may say all
   that other Men do of Christ. Even Balaam could utter some Evangelical
   Truths. A Devil could say, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; for the
   Devils also believe and tremble.--You may weep at the History of
   Christ's Sufferings, when you read how he was abused by the Jews and
   the Romans; and yet you may make light of him, and perish for doing
   so.--You may have a Desire after the Word, and Ordinances of Christ.
   Herod heard the Word gladly; and so do many, who must nevertheless
   perish as Neglecters of Salvation.--You may have a longing after Christ
   to ease your present Distress, and to save you from the Wrath of God;
   and yet you may perish for making light of Christ.--You may do many
   Things in Obedience to Christ, so as to consist with your worldly
   Schemes and Interests, and may escape much of the Pollutions of the
   World thro' the Knowledge of Christ; and yet may neglect him.--You may
   part with much of the World for Christ, as Ananias and Sapphira did.
   Many will lose some of their Profits and Pleasures in Hope of
   Salvation, who shall perish everlastingly, because they had no more
   Value for Salvation.--You may be esteemed and admired by others on
   Account of your Zeal for Christ: and yet perish for making light of
   him.--You may verily think of yourselves, that you prefer Christ and
   Salvation before every Thing else, and yet you may be mistaken, and may
   be judged Despisers of Christ. For Christ does not justify all them,
   who justify themselves.--You may zealously preach Christ and Salvation,
   and reprove others for their Neglect, and lament this Sin in the
   greatest Part of the World, as I am often doing; and yet if you or I
   have no better Evidence to prove our sincere Esteem .for Christ and
   Salvation, we are utterly undone.

   But that your Hopes in a Matter of such infinite Importance may not
   deceive you, there are two Things which are absolutely necessary to be
   found in you. One Thing is this,--Your Esteem for Christ and Salvation
   must be greater than for all the Honours, Profits, or Pleasures of this
   World; or else you slight him. No les than this will be accounted
   sincere, or be accepted to your Salvation. Think not this hard, when
   there is no Comparison between the Things in Question. To esteem the
   greatest Glory on Earth, before Christ and everlasting Glory, is a
   greater Folly in itself, and a greater Injury to Christ, than to esteem
   a Dog before your Prince would be either foolish, or unjust. If any Man
   come to me, says our Lord, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and
   Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Sisters, yea, and his own Life
   also, he cannot be my Disciple.--You must likewise manifest this Esteem
   for Christ and Salvation in your daily Endeavours, by your seeking
   after Christ, and parting with any Thing that he shall require of you.
   God is a Spirit, and will not take an hypocritical Profession, instead
   of the Heart and spiritual Service which he commands. He will have the
   Heart, or Nothing; and even the chief Room in the Heart.--If, after
   considering these two Things, you still say, that you do not make light
   of Christ, or will do no more, let me farther try you in a few
   Particulars, whether you really mean as you say, and do not dissemble.

   1. Will you for the Time to come make Christ and Salvation the chief
   Matter of your Care and Study? Thrust them not out of your Thoughts, as
   a needless or unprofitable Subject; nor allow them only some slight and
   transient Thoughts, which will not affect you. Will you make it your
   Business, at least once a Day, when you are alone, to think seriously,
   what Christ has done for you; or what he will do, if you do not make
   light of it; what it is to be everlastingly happy or miserable; what
   all Things in this World are in Comparison of your everlasting
   Salvation, how soon they will leave you, and what you will then think
   of them? Will you resolve to withdraw yourselves frequently from the
   World, and set yourselves to such Considerations as these? If you will
   not, are you not Slighters of Christ and Salvation, who will not be
   persuaded to think on them seriously?

   2. Will you for the Time to come set a higher Value on the Word of God,
   which is the Discovery and Charter of your Salvation, and your Guide to
   it? You cannot esteem Christ, without esteeming his Word. Whoso
   despiseth the Word, shall be destroyed. Will you therefore attend to
   the publick Preaching of the Word? Will you daily read it? Will you
   resolve to obey it whatever it may cost you? If you will not do this,
   but will make light of the Word of God, you will be judged to have made
   light of Christ and Salvation, whatever you may fondly promise
   yourselves.

   3. Will you for the Time to come set a higher Value on Christ's
   Ministers, whom he has appointed to guide you to Salvation? And will
   you make Use of them for that End? Alas! it is not enough to speak well
   of your Ministers, and duly contribute to their Maintenance. They are
   to be as Physicians under Christ, to apply his Remedies to your
   spiritual Diseases, both in publick and in private; that you may go to
   them, for their Instructions and Advices, their Exhortations and
   Prayers. Will you go to them in private, and solicit their Help? And if
   you have not such near you as are rightly disposed to help you, will
   you go to such as are, and ask them, What you shall do to be saved, and
   how you shall prepare for Death and Judgment? Will you obey the Word of
   God in their Mouths? If you will not inquire of those that should teach
   you, nor use the Means Christ has appointed for your Help, your own
   Consciences shall one day witness against you, that you made light of
   Christ and Salvation. If you doubt whether it be your Duty thus to ask
   Counsel of your Ministers, as sick Men do of their Physicians, let your
   own Necessities and the express Declarations of the Word of God resolve
   you. The Priest's Lips should keep Knowledge, and they should seek the
   Law at his Mouth; for he is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts.

   4. Will you for the Time to come make Conscience of daily fervent
   Prayer to God, that you may have a Part in Christ and Salvation? Do not
   go out of Doors in the Morning, nor lie down to Rest at Night, till you
   have first breathed out these Desires to God. Say not, "God knows my
   Necessities without praying so often." For tho' he does, yet be will
   have you to know and feel them, and have your Desires and all the
   Graces of his Spirit exercised in Prayer. It is he that commands you to
   pray without ceasing. Christ himself spent whole Nights in Prayer, and
   encourages us always to pray, and not to faint. And if you will not be
   persuaded to this, how can you say that you do not make light of Christ
   and Salvation?

   5. Will you for the Time to come cast away your known Sins at the
   Command of Christ? If you have been proud or contentious, malicious and
   revengeful, be so no more. If you have been Adulterers, or Swearers, or
   Drunkards, be so no more. You cannot esteem Christ and Salvation, while
   any known Sin is cherished. What say you? Are you resolved to part with
   every Sin? If not, when you know it is the Will of Christ, and he has
   told you that such shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, are not
   you making light of him?

   6. Will you for the Time to come serve God in the most expensive as
   well as the cheapest Part of his Service? Will you do it not only with
   your Tongues, but with your Estates, and all your Abilities? Shall the
   Poor find that you value Christ more than all the World? Pure Religion
   and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to visit the
   Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction, and to keep yourselves
   unspotted from the World. Will you resolve to cleave to Christ, and
   make Salvation sure, tho' it cost you all you have in the World? If you
   think these Terms are too dear, you make light of Christ, and will be
   judged accordingly.

   7. Will you for the Time to come value every Thing that tends to your
   Salvation, and use every Help that God offers you? Attend upon the
   Word, Sacraments and Prayer; instruct Children and Servants in the
   Knowledge of Christ; sanctify the Lord's Day; get into good Company,
   who set their Faces Heaven-ward; and take Heed of the Company of the
   Vain, the Voluptuous; the Scornful, or any that would hinder you in
   your sacred Work? Will you do these Things; or by neglecting them shew,
   that you are Slighters of Christ?

   . 8. Will you do all these Particulars, not as your Toil, but as your
   Pleasure and Delight? Will you account it your highest Honour, to be
   the Disciples of Christ, to be admitted to serve and worship him, and
   to rejoice with holy Confidence in the Sufficiency of his Sacrifice; by
   which you may have Pardon of all Sin, and a Right to the Inheritance of
   the Saints in Light? If you will do these Things sincerely, you will
   shew your real Value for Christ and Salvation.

   Dearly Beloved in the Lord, I have now done what I proposed on this
   weighty Subject; and what Effect it will have upon any Heart I know
   not; nor is it in my Power to accomplish what my Soul earnestly
   desires. Were it the Lord's Will that I might have my Wish, the Words
   you have been reading should so impress you, as to awaken you out of
   your Security, and prevent your perishing with those, who make light of
   Christ and Salvation. O that I could make every Man's Conscience a
   faithful Preacher to himself, that being ever present with you it might
   prevail! O that the next Time you go prayerless to Bed, or into your
   Business, Conscience might cry out, "Have you no more value for Christ
   and Salvation!" O that the next Time you are tempted to think hardly of
   a holy Life, I will not say, to scoff at it as more than is needful,
   Conscience might loudly say, "Dare not to make light of Christ and
   Salvation!" O that the next Time you are ready to rush upon any known
   Sin, and to gratify corrupt Inclination against the Command of God,
   Conscience might earnestly ask you, "Is Christ and Salvation of no more
   Worth, than to cast them away for every vile Lust!" O that when you are
   following the World with your most eager Desires, and forgetting an
   eternal World, and the awful Change which is so near, Conscience might
   remind you of the infinite Worth of Christ and Salvation! And that when
   you are next spending the Lord's Day in idleness, or in vain
   Amusements, Conscience might faithfully tell you what you are doing! In
   a Word, that in all your Neglects of Duty, and in all your cold and
   formal Prayers and religious Services, Conscience might tell you how
   unsuitable such Endeavours are to an eternal Reward, and that Christ
   and Salvation should not be so slighted! I will say no more but this,
   That it is most lamentable, when God has provided a Saviour for the
   World, when Christ has suffered so much for Sin, made such a compleat
   Atonement to Divine Justice, and purchased so glorious a Kingdom for
   his Saints; and when all this is ao freely offered to Sinners, to lost,
   undeserving, and Hell deserving Sinners; so many Millions should
   nevertheless perish everlastingly, because they make light of their
   Saviour and Salvation, and prefer this vain World and their own
   abominable Lusts! I have delivered my Message; may the Lord open many a
   Heart to receive it! I have endeavour'd to persuade with the Words of
   Truth and Soberness ; may the Lord persuade more effectually, or all I
   have said is in vain.
