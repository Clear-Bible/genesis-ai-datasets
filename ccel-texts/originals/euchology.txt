   THIS EUCHOLOGY

     __________________________________________________________________

   IT is purposed in the following pages

   to give the English Reader a brief

   but complete synopsis of the Daily Di-

   vine Worship of the Orthodox Church.

   Much of that here given I have printed

   previously, in one form or another, at

   different periods and under various cir-

   cumstances. In 1877 I issued privately

   a version of the All-Night-Vigil, and

   of the First, Third, and Sixth Hour

   Offices. In like manner in 1879 I brought

   out a small work, entitled Manual of

   Prayers, which contained the Devotions

   before and after Holy Communion, to-

   gether with the Troparia &c. for the

   whole year, and sundry other matter.

   VIII PREFACE.

   And from time to time I have contributed to the pages of the Orthodox
   Catholic Review renderings of the Passion of the Lord, of the Easter
   Matins, and of the greater part of the Daily Office.

   These intermittent and scattered labours are now collected, with
   additions, into one whole, and arranged in lucid order, with a few
   explanatory notes. Note 5 indicates the sources from which I have drawn
   in compiling the work, but it is fitting that I should especially
   mention how greatly I am indebted to Rajewsky's Euchologion for the
   admirable arrangement of the Daily Office, and to Neale's Introduction
   and Little-dale's Offices for many very accurate renderings of the
   original.

   Had the limits of the work permitted, I could have wished to have given
   the secret prayers of the Liturgies, notwithstanding that Neale's
   incomparable

   PREFACE. IX

   translations of these are readily accessible, and that the scope of
   this book is principally that of a Vade mecum for the laity; but I have
   had to content myself with giving only the audible parts, inserting in
   their proper places in the Order of the Service the variable Hymns &c.
   for Sundays and Week Days and for the principal of the Greater
   Festivals.

   Now that the work is in type in its present form I find here and there,
   owing to the fact that the translations have been made at intervals,
   some slightly varying renderings of one and the same original. For
   these, if they are faults, and for any errors into which I may have
   inadvertently fallen, I entreat the forbearance of the Reader, trusting
   only that the end purposed has been attained, and that the endeavour to
   make more widely known our Church's ancient Worship may prove of some

   X PREFACE.

   small service towards furthering the union of all the Churches, for
   which we daily pray.

   NOTES.

   NOTE I. ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE CHURCH, AND ON THE RITUAL

   An Orthodox Church is divided into three parts, namely, I. The
   Sanctuary, for the Clergy. 2. The Nave, for the Faithful. 3. The Porch,
   for the Catechumens and the Penitents.

   The Sanctuary, towards the east, is separated from the Nave, above
   which it is raised by steps, by a solid screen, called the Iconostas
   (lit. image-stand), pierced by three doorways, which are furnished with
   doors opening inwards, the centre ones being double, and called the
   Royal Gates. These latter are not solid throughout, but at the upper
   part are formed of open wood or metal work, and behind them hangs a
   curtain or veil, which is drawn and withdrawn as the ritual requires.

   In the middle of the Sanctuary stands the Altar, vested, first, with a
   linen covering, and, over this, with one of rich brocade.

   XII NOTES.

   Behind the Altar stands a representation of the Crucifixion, and before
   this a taper or lamp stand with seven branches. A Ciborium stands upon
   the Altar, and, at all times, a Book of the Gospels and a Cross lie
   upon it. When the Ciborium contains the holy Sacrament, reserved for
   the communion of the sick or the absent, or for the Liturgy of the
   Pre-sanctified, a suspended lamp burns before it. At the Celebration of
   the Liturgy, a small cloth, containing Relics, called the Antimins, is
   spread upon the Altar, and upon this are placed the sacred vessels with
   their coverings or veils.

   In the north of the Sanctuary is the Chapel of the Prothesis, where
   stands the Table of Oblations, also richly vested, upon which the
   sacred Gifts are prepared with significant rites before the beginning
   of the Liturgy. In the south of the Sanctuary is the Vestry. This and
   the Chapel of the Prothesis communicate with the Nave by the doors
   already mentioned as being in the Iconostas on either side of the Royal
   Gates.

   The raised floor of the Sanctuary projects westward beyond the
   Iconostas into the Nave, and forms the part called the Soleas, where
   the Choir stands, and in the middle of which is the Ambo, where the
   Deacon says the Ectenias and reads the Gospel.

   NOTES. X11I

   The Iconostas is adorned with representations of the Redeemer and of
   the Saints. In a panel on the right hand or south side of the Royal
   Gates there is always a representation of the Lord, and in a panel on
   the opposite side, one of the Mother of God. The most ancient examples
   of Iconostases are divided into three tiers. In the first and lowest of
   these are the representations of the Redeemer and of the Mother of God
   disposed as before mentioned, and in other panels those of the Saint to
   whom the Church is dedicated, of the Forerunner, of S. Nicolas, and of
   the Angels. In the second tier are depicted the Company of the holy
   Apostles, and in their midst an image of the Lord, :with the Virgin and
   John the Baptist. In the third and highest tier appear the Company of
   holy Prophets, and in their midst an image of the Tokens of the Mother
   of God. Above the centre of the Iconostas is fixed a Cross, either
   standing alone, or flanked by representations of the Virgin and of John
   the Divine. On the Royal Gates are depicted the Annunciation and the
   holy Evangelists, and above them, the Last Supper, and on the north and
   south doors, the holy Archdeacons, or the holy Archangels.

   The Porch in the ancient Church, was reserved for the Catechumens and
   the Peni-

   XIV NOTES.

   tents, but now is used for other purposes; for example, for Litanies in
   the Vigils of Great Festivals, for Prayers for the Departed, and for
   Baptisms; and in the Monasteries it is furnished with a table for
   Icons.

   At the Service time the Priest and Deacon put on tunicles over their
   ordinary cassocks, and maniples upon their wrists. The Priest puts the
   Epitrachelion about his neck, and the Deacon the Orarion upon his left
   shoulder. The Priests' Epitrachelion is a broad strip of brocade
   hanging down before him, and is the token of his sacerdotal office. He
   puts on moreover a vestment or cope, called the Phelonion. The
   Deacon's. Orarion is a long narrow scarf, hanging from his shoulder
   back and front, and is the emblem of his serving office. He holds the
   fore end of this in his fingers when saying the Ectenias, and binds the
   whole about his shoulders in the form of a cross during the time of the
   Communion. The Readers also are vested in tunicles.

   The attitude at worship is standing. This is in accordance with a
   decree of the First Ecumenical Synod of Nic?Â¶a. Kneelings and
   prostrations are also practised, in the Great Fasts and at the Diptychs
   as directed by the rubric, and at other times according to individual
   choice. The worshippers make the

   NOTES. XV

   sign of the Cross on entering and leaving the Church, at the more
   solemn moments of the Service, and as devotion prompts. This is done by
   joining the thumb and first two fingers of the right hand, and touching
   therewith, first, the forehead, next, the breast, then, the right
   shoulder, and lastly, the left.

   The normal position of the Priest is on the west side of the Altar,
   facing the east, and at the Celebration of the Liturgy the details of
   the Consecration and of the Fraction of the Host are not visible to the
   Congregation.

   The holy Sacrament is consecrated in leavened bread, and, in the
   preparation of the holy Gifts at the Table of Oblations, wine and water
   are poured into the Chalice.

   In blessing the people, the Priest turns towards them, and at all times
   gives the blessing with the sign of the Cross.

   Much incense is offered during Divine Worship, the Sanctuary and the
   whole Church being perfumed at the beginning of the Service, and again
   and again repeatedly at the more solemn acts of the Celebration, such
   as the Introits, the Reading of the Gospel, and after the Consecration.

   Lamps and tapers burn about the Altar and before the Icons and Shrines,
   and on certain occasions, for example, at the Easter

   XVI NOTES.

   Matins and during the reading of the Gospels of the Passion on Good
   Friday, all the worshippers hold lighted candles.

   The Hymns &c. are sung, without instrumental accompaniment, in 8 Tones
   based upon the ancient classical modes, namely, the Dorian, Phrygian,
   Lydian, and Jonian for Tones I to 4, and the minors of these for Tones
   5 to 8.

   The Offices are usually recited at full length only in the Monasteries,
   but in the Parish Churches, with the exception of the Liturgy, with
   much abbreviation.

   NOTE 2. ON THE BOOKS CONTAINING THE DIVINE SERVICE.

   These may be classed under three heads, namely, 1. Those for the use of
   the Laity. 2. Those for the use of the Readers and the Choir. 3. Those
   for the use of the Clergy.

   1. The principal Book for the use of the Laity is the Molitvoslov or
   Euchology, which is published both in large and small editions, and
   contains extracts, more or less complete, from the various other
   Service Books suitable to the needs of the Laity in their own homes or
   when assisting at the public worship of the Church. It is upon the
   scope of this Book that the present volume is based.

   NOTES. XVII

   2. The Books for the use of the Readers and the Choir are, the
   Chasoslov or Horology, the Psalter, the Irmologion, the Octo?Â´chos, the
   Menea, the Lenten Triodion, and the Ferial Triodion or Pentecostarion.
   The Chasoslov contains the Daily Offices of Vespers, Compline,
   Nocturns, Matins, and Hours, with some of the more frequently used
   Commemorations, such, for example, as the Troparia for Sundays and Week
   Days, and other matter. The Psalter, in its smaller edition, contains
   the Psalms of David divided into the 20 Kathisms, the Magnifyings with
   selected verses for Festivals the 9 Scriptural Odes, and the Diptychs.
   In its larger edition, it contains moreover all that is found in the
   Chasoslov, together with many other devotions, such as the Prayers
   before and after Holy Communion, a Service for Sunday and one for every
   other day of the Week, &c. The Irmologion contains those parts of the
   Service that are usually sung by the Choir, and notably the Irmi of the
   Canons, whence its name. The Octo?Â´chos, the Menea, and the Triodia are
   Books containing exclusively ecclesiastical compositions, namely, the
   Canons, Stichera, Troparia &c. that make up the Commemorations for the
   whole year. They are used concurrently. The Octo?Â´chos, or Book of

   b

   XVIII NOTES.

   8 Tones, contains Commemorations for 8 weeks: on Mondays, of the
   Angels; on Tuesdays, of the Forerunner; on Wednesdays, of the Mother of
   God; on Thursdays, of the Apostles and of S. Nicolas; on Fridays, of
   the Cross; on Saturdays, of All Saints and of the Departed; and on
   Sundays, of the Resurrection. The rule is to begin this Book on the
   Monday following the Sunday of All Saints, which is the First Sunday
   after Pentecost, and in this week the Canons &c. in Tone I are sung, in
   the next week those in Tone 2, and so on, and when 8 weeks have elapsed
   Tone I is sung again, this order, with a few exceptions, being repeated
   throughout the year. The Menea contains the Canons &c. for the whole
   year according to the days of the month. It is published in two forms,
   I. As a work of 12 volumes, one for every month. 2. As a work of 2
   volumes, one containing the Canons &c. for the Greater Festivals, and
   the other, those common for the Saints. The Lenten Triodion contains
   the penitential Commemorations from the Sunday of the Publican and
   Pharisee, which is the Sunday preceding that of Septua-gesima, until
   Easter Eve; and the Ferial Triodion, the joyful ones from Easter Day
   until the Sunday of All Saints.

   3. The Books for the use of the Clergy

   NOTES. XIX

   are the Slouj?Â©bnik and the Tr?Â©bnik. The Slouj?Â©bnik (lit. Service
   Book) contains the Prayers, audible and secret, of the Priest and
   Deacon at Vespers, Matins, and the Liturgies. The Tr?Â©bnik (lit.
   Ritual) contains, in its smaller form, the rest of the Sacraments
   affecting the Laity other than the Eucharist, and, in addition, the
   Churching of Women, the Visitation and Communion of the Sick, the
   Burial of the Dead, the Santification of Water on the Day of the
   Epiphany, and other matter; and, in its larger form, besides the
   fore-mentioned, the Ordinal, the Professing of Monks, the Consecration
   of Churches, &c.

   There are moreover the Book of the Gospels and the Book of the
   Epistles, which, in the public worship, are used, the former by the
   Deacon, and the latter by the Reader.

   NOTE 3. ON SOME UNTRANSLATABLE TERMS.

   Acathist. A term applied to certain hymns during the singing of which
   sitting is prohibited.

   Condakion. A term the origin of which is uncertain. It is itself a
   verse which expresses briefly the purport of the whole Commemoration of
   any given Festival or occasion. Its proper place in ecclesiastical
   composition is after the Sixth Ode in a Canon, and it is usually
   followed by another

   XX NOTES.

   verse called Icos, a word corresponding with the anglicized Italian
   word, Stanza.

   Ectenia. A term applied to the Suffrages, because of their protracted
   character.

   Exapostilarion. A verse preceding the Psalms of Praise at Matins, sung
   by one of the clergy who is sent out of his place into the middle of
   the Church to sing it.

   Hypaco?Â´. A term implying that the verse bearing its name should be
   listened to with particular attention.

   Irmos. A verse that is the rhythmical model of others that follow it.
   Every Ode in a Canon is preceded by such a verse, which may, or may
   not, form an integral part of the particular theme of the Ode. See the
   Canon for Easter where the Irmi do, and the Canon for Holy Communion
   where they do not form such parts of their respective Odes. The Irmi in
   a Canon are the verses usually sung, while those that follow them may
   be read, or even omitted.

   Katavasia. A verse sung at the conclusion of an Ode, frequently the
   Irmos of that Ode, when the Choirs descend from their places in the
   stalls into the middle of the Church to sing it.

   Kathism. A term applied to certain lections and chants, principally of
   the Psalter, during which the people may sit.

   NOTES. XXI

   Prokimenon. A verse preceding (lit. lying before) the Lections from the
   holy Scriptures.

   Stichera. A series of verses, usually ecclesiastically composed ones.

   Troparion. A verse that is composed (lit. turns) upon a rhythmical
   model. It has however come to have a wider meaning, and, like Condakion
   (q. v.), or, together with this, serves briefly to commemorate any
   given occasion.

   These terms are all of Greek origin, and are also used in Slavonic
   without translation.

   NOTE 4. EXPLANATION OF RUBRICS ETC.

   A. The Prefatory Psalm. Page 2.

   The Office of Vespers is always begun with this Psalm for the reason
   that it recounts the wonders of Creation, and is therefore a fitting
   beginning for the complete performance of a day's Divine Worship,
   which, commencing with Vespers, concludes with the celebration of
   Liturgy, in which the great act of Redemption is shewn forth.

   B. The First Antiphon of the Psalter. Page 4.

   This is an abbreviation of the 1st Stasis

   of the 1st Kathism of the Psalter. Vide Chap. XXVII.

   C. The 'ÃÃºLord, I have cried'ÃÃ¹. Page 5.

   This is the proper Vesper Psalm. Its

   selection is obvious from the expression of

   XXII NOTES.

   the second verse, 'ÃÃºLet my prayer be set forth before thee as incense,
   the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice'ÃÃ¹. Other
   appropriate Psalms recording prophetically the descent of the Redeemer
   into hades on the evening of the day after his Passion are subjoined.
   With the verses of these Psalms are interspersed proper verses
   (Stichera) commemorative of the occasion. It is however only in the
   Monasteries that the Psalms and Stichera are recited and sung at
   length. In the Parish Churches it is customary to sing only the first
   two verses of the 'ÃÃºLord I have cried'ÃÃ¹, and to add two Stichera,
   with Glory. Both now, between these. Vide the selections for the
   Sundays of Palms and Pentecost at pages 272 and 411. In the Service for
   a Sunday in Tone 6, and in the Penitential Service to the Lord
   (Chapters XVII and XVIII) a fuller number of Stichera is given; and for
   Holy and Great Saturday, at page 362, the special Stichera for that day
   are conjoined with those on the Resurrection, thus illustrating the
   manner in which the Lenten Triodion is used concurrently with the
   Octo?Â´chos. It may here be remarked that the Stichera for Sundays in
   Tones 1 and 2 are found respectively at pages 362'ÃÃ®4 and 400'ÃÃ®402,
   thus supplying, in this work, commemorations of the Resurrection in
   three of

   NOTES. XXIII

   the Eight Tones in which these Stichera are sung with the 'ÃÃºLord, I
   have cried'ÃÃ¹.

   D. '&gt; The Evening Hymn to the Son of God. Page 8.

   This is the proper Vesper Hymn of the Church. It is designated
   throughout this work, 'ÃÃºThe Tranquil Light'ÃÃ¹, and is said to be the
   composition of the Martyr Athenogenes, A. D. 296.

   E. The Prokimenon. Page 9.

   This, as explained at page XXI, is a verse preceding Lections from the
   Scriptures. Here, though the singing of the Prokimenon is retained, the
   Lections, excepting on the Eves of Great Festivals, have fallen into
   disuse. When used their number varies, but it is generally three; for
   example, those for the Eves of the Sundays of Palms and Pentecost are
   respectively,

   Of Palms. Of Pentecost.

   These are verses in which the occasion of the day is further
   commemorated. In the Monasteries the singing of them on the Eve of a
   Great Festival is preceded by a procession

   XXIV NOTES.

   of the Priest, Deacon and Choir, carrying burning tapers, into the
   Porch, where a Litany is sung, and is followed by a rite performed in
   the Nave, called, The Benediction of the Loaves. This rite is described
   in detail by Dr. Neale in his 'ÃÃºIntroduction'ÃÃ¹.

   G. The 'ÃÃºMany mercies'ÃÃ¹. Page 24.

   The abbreviated form here given is that used in the Parish Churches.
   The 'ÃÃºMany mercies'ÃÃ¹ is sung on Sundays when the 'ÃÃºBlessed are they
   that are undefiled'ÃÃ¹. (Kath-ism 17) is not appointed to be read (Vide
   the Table on pages 478 and 479), and also on the Festivals printed in
   the Kalendar in capitals and italics.

   H. The Gradual. Page 27.

   This is the 1st Antiphon of the Graduals in Tone 4. The Graduals are
   common to all the Tones. For those in Tone 6 vide page 185.

   I. The Canon. Page 33.

   A brief indication of the composition of this is given in a foot note,
   but it may be well to remark that the Canon is, as the name implies,
   the ruling feature of all Commemorations. Every day throughout the year
   is provided with one or more, though, excepting in the Monasteries,
   they are not recited in full, their Irmi and Condakia, or even the
   Condakia alone, sufficing for their whole.

   NOTES. XXV

   J. The Psalms of Praise. Page 36.

   To the singing of the verses of these with the conjoined Stichera the
   same remarks apply as to the 'ÃÃºLord, I have cried'ÃÃ¹.

   For the Irmi of this vide page 267, et seq.

   Antiphons, Introits, Prokimena, Irmi of Odes IX, Communion Hymns, Sec.
   not given in this Chap, will be found in Chap. XXIV.

   M. Diptychs. Chap. XXVI.

   This, though found in the Psalter, is rather a private than a public
   devotion. It may however be very fittingly used by a Christian on any
   occasion as opportunity serves.

   N. The Kalendar. Chap. XXIX.

   The arrangement of the Commemorations varies slightly in different
   Service Books, and even in different editions of the same Book. The
   arrangement here given is taken from an edition of the Molitvoslov
   published at Kiev in the reign of the Empress Elizabeth.

   I. THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL

   AS HELD ON THE EVE OF A FESTIVAL WHEN

   THE GREAT VESPERS AND THE GREAT MATINS

   ARE CONJOINED.

   THE GREAT VESPERS.

   When the time for the Service is come the Warden lighteth the lamps and
   tapers, and the Priest and Deacon put on their vestments. And the
   Priest taketh the censer, and, accompanied by the Deacon bearing a
   lighted taper, he censeth the Altar.

   And the Deacon beginneth,

   RISE! Master, give the blessing.

   The Priest saith,

   GLORY to the holy, consubstantial

   life-giving and undivided Trinity, always, now and ever, and to ages of
   ages.

   And the Choir answereth, Amen.

   2 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   O

   Then saith the Priest,

   COME, let us worship God our King.

   O come, let us worship and fall down

   before Christ God, our King.

   O come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, our God and
   King.

   And then he censeth the whole Church and the Congregation. And the
   Choir singeth the Prefatory Psalm, namely, Psalm 103 (104.), which is
   usually abbreviated as followeth,

   LESS the Lord, O my soul: blessed

   art thou, O Lord.

   O Lord my God, thou art very great: blessed art thou, O Lord.

   Thou art clothed with honour and majesty: blessed art thou, O Lord.

   Above the hills the waters stand: marvellous are thy works, O Lord.

   Between the hills the waters flow: marvellous are thy works, O Lord.

   In wisdom hast thou made them all: Creator of all things, glory to
   thee.

   Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. Creator of
   all things, glory to thee.

   Both now, and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen. Creator of all things,
   glory to thee.

   Then followeth the Ectenia of Peace.

   Deacon. In peace let us pray to the Lord.

   THE GREAT VESPERS. '&gt; 3

   Choir. Lord, have mercy. And so after the succeeding petitions.

   Deacon. For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our
   souls, let us pray to the Lord.

   For the peace of the whole world, the good estate of the holy Churches
   of God. and for the union of them all, let us pray to the Lord.

   For this holy Church, and for them that with faith, piety and fear of
   God enter into it, let us pray to the Lord.

   For the most holy governing Synod (or, For our Metropolitan N., as so
   subject), for the honourable Presbytery, the Diaconate in Christ, for
   all the clergy and the laity, let us pray to the Lord.

   Here follow petitions for the Sovereign and the other members of the
   Reigning House, mentioning them by name.

   To aid them in battle and to put down under their feet every enemy and
   adversary, let us pray to the Lord.

   For this city (or, if it is a Monastery, For this holy Habitation), for
   every city and country, and for the faithful dwelling in them, let us
   pray to the Lord.

   For healthiness of weather, plentifulness of the fruits of the earth
   and for peaceful times, let us pray to the Lord.

   4 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   For them that are at sea, for travellers, for the siek, for them that
   are in bonds and captivity, and for their salvation, let us pray to the
   Lord.

   For our deliverance from all affliction, passion and want, let us pray
   to the Lord.

   Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by thy grace.

   Commemorating our most holy, most pure, most blessed glorious Lady, the
   God-bearing ever-virgin Mary, together with all the Saints, let us
   commend ourselves, and one another, and all our life to Christ our God.

   Choir. To thee, O Lord. Exclamation.

   Priest. For to thee are due all glory, honour and worship, to the
   Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to
   ages of ages. Choir. Amen.

   Then is sung the First Antiphon of the Psalter on this wise:

   LESSED is the man that walketh not

   in the counsel of the ungodly.

   The way of the ungodly shall perish.

   Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice before him with trembling.

   Blessed are they that put their trust in him. Arise, O Lord: save me, O
   my God. Thy blessing is upon thy people.

   THE GREAT VESPERS. 5

   Glory. Both now.

   And after every verse, Alleluia, thrice. Then,

   Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God, thrice.

   Then followeth the Little Ectenia.

   Deacon. Again and again in peace let us pray to the Lord.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon. Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by thy
   grace.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon. Commemorating our most holy, most pure, most blessed glorious
   Lady, the God-bearing ever-virgin Mary, together with all the Saints,
   let us commend ourselves, and one another, and all our life to Christ
   our God.

   Choir. To thee, O Lord. Exclamation.

   Priest. For thine is the strength and thine is the kingdom, the power
   and the glory, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
   now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen. And singeth the Lord, I have cried in the proper Tone.

   LORD, I HAVE CRIED.

   ORD, I have cried unto thee, hear me.

   Hear me, O Lord.

   Lord, I have cried unto thee, hear

   6 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   me: attend to the voice of my prayer when I cry unto thee.

   Hear me, O Lord.

   Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, the lifting up of my
   hands as the evening sacrifice.

   Hear me, O Lord.

   The ensuing verses are usually read.

   Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door of defence about my
   lips.

   Incline not my heart to evil words to make excuses for sins.

   With men that work transgression, and I will not unite with their
   chosen ones.

   The righteous shall chasten me in mercy and reprove me, but let not the
   oil of the sinner anoint my head.

   For my prayer also is still by their goodwill: their judges have been
   swallowed up in stony places.

   They shall hear my words, for they have been strong: as a clod of earth
   is crushed upon the earth, their bones have been scattered beside
   hades.

   For mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord: O Lord, in thee is my trust, O
   cast not out my soul.

   Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the traps
   of the wicked doers.

   THE GREAT VESPERS. style=" 7

   Sinners shall fall into their own net together: I am as one alone until
   I pass away.

   I have cried unto the Lord with my voice, with my voice unto the Lord
   did I make my prayer.

   I will pour out my prayer before him, I will declare before him mine
   affliction.

   When my spirit went forth from me, then thou knewest my paths.

   In the way wherein I walked they hid a snare for me.

   I looked on my right hand and beheld, and there was none that knew me.

   Refuge failed me, and there was no one caring for my soul.

   I have cried unto thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my trust, my
   portion in the land of the living.

   Attend unto my prayer, for I am brought low exceedingly.

   Deliver me from them that persecute me, for they are stronger than I.

   Here beginneth the singing of the Stichera, if there are 10 appointed.

   Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy name.

   The righteous wait for me until thou re

   ward me. Here, if 8.

   Out of the depths have I cried unto thee O Lord, O Lord, hear my voice.

   8 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   O let thine ears be attentive unto the voice of my prayer.

   Here, if 6.

   If them, O Lord, shouldest mark transgression, O Lord, who should
   stand? But with thee there is propitiation.

   For thy name's sake have I waited for thee, O Lord: my soul hath waited
   for thy word, my soul hath trusted in the Lord.

   Here, if 4.

   From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch let Israel
   trust in the Lord.

   For with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteons redemption, and
   he shall redeem Israel from all his transgressions.

   Praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise him, all ye peoples.

   For his mercy is confirmed upon us, and the truth of the Lord remaineth
   for ever.

   Glory. Both now.

   When the singing of the Stichera is ended the Deacon saith with a loud
   voice,

   Wisdom! Stand up!

   And the Introit is made. And the Choir singeth the Evening Hymn to the
   Son of God.

   RANQUIL Light of holy glory of the immortal Father, heavenly, holy,
   blessed, O Jesus Christ! We, having reached

   THE GREAT VESPERS. 9

   the setting sun, seeing the evening light, sing Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit, God. Worthy art thou at all times to be sung with reverent
   voices, Son of God, Life-giver. Wherefore the world doth glorify thee.

   This being ended, the Deacon saith, Let us attend. Priest. Peace to
   all. Choir. And to thy spirit. Deacon. Wisdom! Let us attend. Reader.
   Prokimenon!

   Here followeth the Prokimenon.

   On Saturday Evening. Â·Ã¸Ã¦The Lord is king: he hath put on glorious
   apparel.'ÃÃ´ TWICE *

   Verse. The Lord hath put on might and hath girded himself.

   On Tuesday Evening. Thy mercy, O Lord, shall follow me all Ã¡he days of

   Verse. The Lord is my shepherd, therefore shall I lack nothing: he
   shall feed me in a green pasture.

   On Wednesday Evening. Save me, O God, for thy name's sake, and avenge
   me in thy strength.

   *The word 'ÃÃºtwice'ÃÃ¹ and the quotes around the previous passage were
   handwritten in the manuscript.

   IO THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   Verse. Hear my prayer, O God, hearken unto the words of my mouth.

   On Thursday Evening. My help is from the Lord, who hath made heaven and
   earth.

   Verse. I have lifted up mine eyes to the hills, whence cometh my help.

   On Friday Evening. God is my defence, the God of my mercy shall prevent
   me.

   Verse. Deliver me from mine enemies, O God, defend me from them that
   rise up against me.

   After the Prokimenon are read the Lections from the Old Testament, if
   any are appointed.

   Then followeth the Great Ectenia.

   Deacon. Let us all say with our whole soul, and with our whole mind let
   us say,

   Choir. Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon. O Lord almighty, God of our fathers, we pray thee, hear and
   have mercy.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon. Have mercy on us, O God, according to thy great mercy, we pray
   thee, hear and have mercy.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy, thrice. And so after the succeeding petitions,
   those immediately following being for the Sovereign and the other
   members of the Reigning House, mentioning them by name.

   Again let us pray for the most holy Governing Synod (If subject to a
   Metropolitan, Again let us pray for our Metropolitan N.), and for all
   our brotherhood in Christ.

   THE GREAT VESPERS. II

   Again let us pray for all their Christ-loving army.

   Again let us pray for the blessed and ever memorable founders of this
   holy (Church, or) Habitation, and for all our right-believing fathers
   and brethren that have fallen asleep before us(that rest here and in
   every otherplace).

   Again let us pray for mercy, life, peace, health, salvation,
   protection, forgiveness and remission of sins for the servants of God,
   the brethren of this holy Habitation. (Or, the servants of God here
   present and praying unto thee).

   Again let us pray for them that bring forth fruit and do good works in
   this holy and all venerable Church, serving and singing in it, and for
   all the people standing about, expecting from thee great and rich
   mercy.

   Exclamation.

   Priest. For a merciful and man-loving God thou art, and we ascribe
   glory to thee, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,
   now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen.

   Then is read the following Prayer.

   OUCHSAFE, O Lord, to keep us this evening without sin. Blessed art
   thou, O Lord God of our fathers, and blessed

   and hallowed is thy name to ages. Amen.

   O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us, like

   12 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   as we have put our trust in thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord: O teach me
   thy statutes. Blessed art thou, O Master: make me to understand thy
   statutes. Blessed art thou, O Holy One: enlighten me with thy statutes.
   O Lord, thy mercy endureth for ever: despise not thou the works of
   thine own hands. To thee is due praise, to thee is due a hymn, to thee
   is due glory, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages of
   ages. Amen.

   Then the Ectenia of Supplication.

   Deacon. Let us accomplish our evening prayer to the Lord. Choir, Lord,
   have mercy.

   Deacon. Help us, save us, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by thy
   grace.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon. That the whole evening may be perfect, holy, peaceful and
   sinless, let us ask of the Lord. Choir. Vouchsafe, O Lord. And so after
   the succeeding petitions.

   Deacon. An Angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls
   and bodies, let us ask of the Lord.

   Pardon and remission of our sins and of our transgressions, let us ask
   of the Lord.

   What is good and profitable for our souls, and peace for the world, let
   us ask of the Lord.

   That the remaining time of our life may he spent in peace and
   repentance, let us ask of the Lord.

   THE GREAT VESPERS. 13

   A Christian end to our life, without pain and shame, peaceful, and a
   good confession before the terrible judgment-seat of Christ let us ask.

   Commemorating our most holy, most pure, most blessed glorious Lady, the
   God-bearing ever-virgin Mary, together with all the Saints, let us
   commend ourselves and one another, and all our life to Christ our God.

   Choir. To thee, O Lord. Exclamation.

   Priest. For a good and man-loving God thou art, and we ascribe glory to
   thee, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and
   ever, and to ages of ages. Choir. Amen.

   Exclamation.

   Priest. Blessed and glorified be the might of thy kingdom, of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to
   ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen. And singeth the Stichera according to the day.

   Then is read the Prayer of S. Simeon.

   ORD, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy
   word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared
   before the face of all people, to be a light to lighten the gentiles
   and to be the glory of thy people Israel. Then,

   I4 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   H

   OLY God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Im-

   mortal One, have mercy upon us, thrice.

   Glory. Both now.

   O

   MOST Holy Trinity, have mercy upon

   us. O Lord, cleanse our sins. O Master,

   forgive our transgressions. Visit us, O Holy One, and heal our
   infirmities, for thy name's sake. Lord, have mercy, thrice.

   Glory. Both now.

   UR Father, which art in heaven. Hal-lowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
   come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day
   our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that
   trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us
   from evil.

   Priest. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to
   ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen. And continueth,

   H

   AIL! Virgin Mother of God. O Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with
   thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy
   womb; for thou hast borne the Saviour of our souls.

   Otherwise the proper Troparion of the Day is sung.

   THE GREAT VESPERS. 15

   They sing also,

   B

   LESSED be the name of the Lord from

   henceforth, and to all ages, thrice.

   Then is read Psalm 33 (34).

   WILL bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall continually be in my
   mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord, the humble shall hear
   thereof and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his
   name together. I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me
   from all my fears. Ye came unto him and were enlightened, and your
   faces were not ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him,
   and saved him out of all his afflictions. The Angel of the Lord shall
   encamp round about them that fear him, and shall deliver them. O taste
   and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
   O fear the Lord, all ye his saints, for there is no want to them that
   fear him. The rich do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the
   Lord shall not want any good thing.

   Priest. The blessing of the Lord, by his own divine grace and love to
   man, be upon you always, now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen.

   And now immediately followeth the Great Matins, the Reader beginning
   forthwith to read the Six Psalms.

   O '&gt; Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth

   ORD, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many are they that rise
   up against me. Many one there be that say of my soul, There is no
   salvation for him in his God. But thou, O Lord, art my defender, my
   glory and the lifter up of my head. I cried unto the Lord with my
   voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. I laid me down and slept:
   I rose up again, for the Lord defended me. I will not be afraid for ten
   thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about.
   Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God. For thou hast smitten all that
   without cause are mine enemies, thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
   Salvation belongeth unto the Lord, and thy blessing is upon thy people.

   health in my flesh because of thine anger, neither is there any rest in
   my bones by reason of my sins. For my transgressions have gone over my
   head, as a heavy burden they are heavy upon me. My wounds have become
   noisome and corrupt because of my foolishness. I am wretched and bowed
   down continually, I go mourning all the day long. For my loins are
   filled with illusions, and there is no health in my flesh. I have been
   wrought evil and humbled exceedingly, I have cried bitterly, because of
   the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my
   groaning is not hidden from thee. My heart is troubled, my strength
   hath failed me, and the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. My
   friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and my
   nearest of kin stood afar off. And they that sought my soul used
   violence, and they that sought my hurt spake vanities and imagined
   deceits all the day long. But I, as a deaf man, heard not, and I was as
   a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. And I became as a man that
   heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. For in thee, O Lord,
   have I trusted, thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God. For I said, Lest at
   any time mine enemies rejoice against me, and when my feet slipped they
   spake great things

   against me. For I am ready for scourges, and my grief is continually
   before me. For I will confess my transgression, and be sorry for my
   sin. But mine enemies live and are mightier than I, and they that hate
   me wrongfully are multiplied. They that render me evil for good
   slandered me, because I followed goodness. Forsake me not, O Lord, my
   God, be not thou far from me. Attend unto my help, O Lord of my
   salvation.

   Forsake me not, O Lord my God, be not thou far from me. Attend unto my
   help, Lord of my salvation.

   GOD, my God, for thee do I watch at break of day. For thee my soul hath
   thirsted, for thee my flesh how simply, in a barren, untrodden and
   waterless land. Thus in the sanctuary have I appeared before thee, to
   see thy power and thy glory. For thy mercy is better than life: my lips
   shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live, and in thy name
   will I lift up my hands. Let my soul be filled as with marrow and
   fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips. Forasmuch as
   I have remembered thee upon my bed, and meditated on thee in the
   morning, because thou hast been my helper; and under the covert of thy
   wings will I rejoice. My soul hath cleaved unto

   THE GREAT MATINS. style=" I9

   thee, and thy right hand hath upholden me. But they that vainly sought
   after my soul, they shall go into the lowest parts of the earth. They
   shall be delivered up to the hand of the sword, they shall be portions
   for foxes. But the king shall rejoice in God: every one that sweareth
   by him shall be commended, for the mouth of them that speak unjustly
   shall be stopped.

   I have meditated on thee in the morning, because thou hast been my
   helper, and under the covert of thy wings will I rejoice. My soul hath
   cleaved unto thee, and thy right hand hath upholden me.

   Glory. Both now. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God,

   LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee. O let
   my prayer come in before thee, incline thine ear to my petition. For my
   soul is full of trouble, and my life draweth nigh to hades. I am
   counted among them that go down to the pit: I am as a man without help,
   free among the dead. Like the slain sleeping in the grave, whom thou
   remem-berest no more, and they are cut away from thy hand. They laid me
   in the lowest pit, in darkness and in the shadow of death. Thy

   2O THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   wrath hath pressed heavily upon me, and all thy waves thou hast brought
   in upon me. Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, they have made
   me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up and came not forth,
   mine eyes were dimmed through poverty. I cried unto thee, O Lord, all
   the day long, I stretched forth my hands unto thee. Wilt thou work
   wonders for the dead? or shall physicians raise them up, and they
   confess thee? Shall any one declare thy mercy in the grave, and thy
   truth in destruction? Shall thy wonders be known in the darkness, and
   thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? But unto thee have I
   cried, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.
   Wherefore, O Lord, dost thou reject my soul, and turn away thy face
   from me? I am poor and in troubles from my youth up, and having been
   exalted, I have been brought low and into despair. Thine anger hath
   passed over me, and thy terrors have disquieted me. They came round
   about me like water, all the day they beset me together. Friend and
   neighbour hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance from my
   misery.

   O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee. Let
   my prayer come in before thee, incline thine ear to my petition.

   LESS the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless his holy
   name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who
   forgiveth all thy transgressions, who healeth all thy diseases. Who
   redeemeth thy life from corruption, who crowneth thee with mercy and
   compassion. Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, so that thy
   youth is renewed as an eagle's. The Lord executeth mercy and judgment
   for all that suffer wrong. He made known his ways unto Moses, his will
   unto the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful,
   longsuffering and of many mercies. He will not always be angry, neither
   will he be wrathful for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our
   transgressions, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For according to
   the height of heaven above the earth, so hath the Lord confirmed his
   mercy upon them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so
   far hath he removed our transgressions from us. As a father hath
   compassion upon his sons, so hath the Lord compassion upon them that
   fear him. For he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are but
   dust. As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the field so
   shall he flourish. For the spirit passeth through in him, and he is
   not, and

   22 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   shall know his place no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from ages
   and unto ages upon them that fear him. And his righteousness upon sons'
   sons, to them that keep his testament, and remember his commandments to
   do them. The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven, and his kingdom
   ruleth over all. Bless the Lord, all ye his Angels, mighty in strength,
   that fulfil his word, hearkening unto the voice of his orders. Bless
   the Lord, all ye his Hosts, ye Ministers of his that do his will. Bless
   the Lord, all ye his works, in every place of his dominion. Bless the
   Lord, O my soul.

   In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul.

   LORD, hear my prayer, give ear unto my supplication in thy truth, hear
   me in thy righteousness. And enter not into judgment with thy servant,
   for in thy sight shall none living be justified. For the enemy hath
   persecuted my soul, he hath smitten my life down to the ground. He hath
   made me to dwell in dark places as them that have been long dead, and
   my spirit is vexed within me, my heart within me is desolute. I
   remember the days of old, I meditate on all thy doings, I muse on the
   works of thy hands. I stretch forth my hands unto thee, my soul gaspeth
   unto thee as a thirsty land Hear me, O Lord,

   THE GREAT MATINS. 23

   and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint. Hide not thy face from me,
   lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. O let me hear thy
   mercy betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust. Make known unto
   me, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk, for I have lifted up my soul
   unto thee, Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord, for I fly unto thee to
   hide me. Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God. Thy good Spirit
   shall lead me into the land of righteousness: thou shalt quicken me, O
   Lord, for thy name's sake. In thy righteousness thou shalt bring my
   soul out of affliction, and in thy mercy thou shalt cut off mine
   enemies, and shalt destroy all them that afflict my soul&gt; for I am
   thy servant.

   Hear me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, and enter not into judgment with
   thy servant, twice. Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the land of
   righteousness.

   Then saith the Reader,

   The Choir repeateth the same, likewise also after every one of the
   following verses.

   Verse. O give thanks unto the Lord, because he is good, because his
   mercy endureth for ever.

   Verse. They compassed me about, yea, they compassed me about, but in
   the name of the Lord will I destroy them.

   Verse. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.

   Verse. The stone which the builders refused is become the head-stone of

   Then are sung the Troparia proper to the day. And, Lord, have mercy,

   art a good and man-loving God, and to thee we ascribe glory, to the
   Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to
   ages of ages. Choir. Amen. And singeth the Many mercies, that is,
   Psalms 134 (135) and 135 (136), usually on this wise:

   Y the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, when we remembered thee,

   Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children and dasheth them against

   But on Sundays they sing the following Troparia in Tone 5.

   Refrain. Blessed art thou, O Lord: O teach me thy statutes.

   HE assembly of Angels were amazed seeing thee numbered among the dead,
   thee, O Saviour, that didst destroy the might of death, that didst

   radiant Angel at the grave to the myrrh-bearing

   women. Behold ye the grave, and be glad, for the Saviour is risen from

   Very early in the morning the myrrh-bear-ing women came to thy tomb
   lamenting, but the Angel stood before them and said, The time of
   wailing is past, weep not, but go and tell the Resurrection to the
   Apostles.

   The myrrh-bearing women, coming with myrrh to thy tomb, O Saviour,
   wept, but an Angel spake unto them and said, Why think ye that the
   Living is among the dead? For, as God, he is risen from the tomb.
   Glory.

   Let us worship the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the Holy
   Trinity in One Substance, crying with the Seraphim, Holy, holy, holy
   art thou, O Lord. Both now.

   Thou, O Virgin, didst bring forth the Giver of life, hast delivered
   Adam from sin, and given joy to Eve instead of sorrow; for he that was

   ROM my youth up many passions have afflicted me, but thou, my Saviour,
   thyself deliver me and save me.

   They that hate Sion shall be confounded by the Lord, like grass by fire
   so shall they be withered.

   Every soul is quickened by the Holy Ghost, and by his purity is
   elevated, and is mystically enlightened by the Trinal Unity.

   Choir. Glory to thee, Lord, glory to thee. The Priest readeth the
   Gospel.

   At its conclusion the Choir again singeth, Glory to thee, Lord, glory
   to thee.

   Here the order of the Service is somewhat varied according to the day.

   A. On Sundays after the Glory to thee, Lord, glory to thee, they sing,

   AVING seen the Resurrection of Christ, we adore the holy Lord Jesus,
   who alone is without sin. Thy Cross, O Master, we worship, and sing and
   glorify thy holy Resurrection; for thou art our God, we know none other
   beside thee, we call upon thy name. O come, all ye faithful, let us

   THE GREAT MATINS. '&gt; 29

   adore Christ's holy Resurrection; for, by the Cross great joy is come
   into all the world. Therefore, ever blessing the Lord, we sing his
   Resurrection; for, enduring crucifixion, death by death he overthrew.

   Then is read Psalm 50 (5I).

   AVE mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great mercy, and according
   to the multitude of thy compassions, cleanse my transgression. Wash me
   throughly from my transgression, and cleanse me from my sin. For I know
   my transgression, and my sin is continually before me. Against thee
   only have I sinned, and done evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be
   justified in thy words and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
   Behold, I was shapen in transgressions, and in sins did my mother
   conceive me. Behold, thou hast loved truth, thou hast manifested to me
   the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom. Thou shalt sprinkle me with
   hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made
   whiter than snow. Thou shalt make me to hear of joy and gladness, and
   the bones which thou hast broken shall rejoice. Turn thy face from my
   sins, and cleanse all my transgressions. Create in me a clean heart, O
   God, and renew a right spirit within me.

   30 THK ALL-NIGHT VlGIL.

   Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from
   me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and stablish me with thy
   free Spirit. I will teach thy ways unto transgressors, and the wicked
   shall be converted unto thee. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God,
   thou that art the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing of thy
   righteousness. Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, and my mouth shall shew
   forth thy praise. For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have
   given it, but thou delightest not in burnt offerings. Sacrifice to God
   is a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart God will not despise.
   Be gracious, O Lord, in thy good pleasure unto Sion, and let the walls
   of Jerusalem be built. Then shalt thou be well pleased with the
   sacrifice of righteousness, with the oblations and holocausts. Then
   shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar.

   After this the Choir singeth, Glory.

   Through the prayers of the Apostles, O Merciful One, cleanse the
   multitude of our transgressions.

   Both now.

   Through the prayers of the Mother of God, O Merciful One, cleanse the
   multitude of our transgressions.

   Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy

   great goodness : according to the multitude of thy mercies cleanse mine
   offences.

   Jesus hath risen from the grave, as he foretold, granting us eternal
   life and great mercy.

   B. '&gt; On the Festivals of the Lord, after the

   Gospel and the Glory to thee, Lord . . .

   Psalm 50 (51) is read, and the Choir singeth,

   Glory., and the Verse for the Festival, for

   and the appointed Sticheron or Hypaco?Â´.

   D. '&gt; On the Sunday of the Publican, and

   thence until the Fifth Sunday of the Great

   Fast, after the Hymn, Having seen the Re-

   surrection .... and the reading of Psalm

   50 (51), they sing,

   32 THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL.

   Glory.. Open thou, O Life-giver, the gates of repentance to me, for my
   soul longeth for thy holy temple, though its own bodily temple is
   wholly defiled, but thou, in thy bounty, cleanse it according to thy
   loving-kindness.

   Both now.

   O Mother of God, lead me into the path of salvation, for I have
   hardened my soul by shameful sins, and I have spent all my life in
   sloth. Save me then by thy prayers from all impurity.

   Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness : according to the
   multitude of thy mercies cleanse mine offences.

   When I, accursed, meditate on the nuirfber of evils I have wrought, I
   tremble for the terrible day of judgement. Still, trusting in the mercy
   of thy loving-kindness, I cry to thee as David, Have mercy upon me, O
   God, according to thy great mercy.

   And now the Deacon saith the following Prayer.

   GOD, save thy people and bless thine inheritance, visit the world with
   thy mercy and bounties, exalt the horn of Orthodox Christians, and send
   down upon us thy rich mercies, through the prayers of our most holy

   And the Choir singeth,

   Y soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my

   For he hath regarded the lowliness of his handmaiden; for, behold, from
   henceforth, all generations shall call me blessed.

   For he that is mighty hath magnified me, and holy is his name, and his
   mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.

   He hath shewed strength with his arm, he hath scattered the proud in
   the imaginations of their hearts.

   He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and he hath exalted the
   lowly : he hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he
   hath sent empty away.

   He, remembering his mercy, hath holpen his servant Israel, as he
   promised to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.

   And they sing the Ninth Ode.

   And singeth the Exapostilarion of the Festival.

   Then they sing the Psalms of Praise, namely, Psalms 148, 149 and 150.

   ET every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.

   Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the highest.

   Let them praise the name of the Lord; for he spake and they were made,

   Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, and let the children of Sion

   Let them praise his name in the choir, let them sing praises unto him

   For the Lord hath pleasure in his people, and will exalt the meek unto
   salvation.

   The saints shalt exult in glory, and shall rejoice upon their beds.

   The high praises of God shall be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword
   in their hands;

   To execute vengeance upon the nations, and chastisement upon the
   peoples;

   To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with links of iron:

   To do unto them the judgment written, This glory shall be for all his
   saints.

   Here beginneth the singing of the Stichera.

   O praise God in his saints, praise him in the firmament of his power.

   Praise him for his mighty acts, praise him according to the greatness
   of his majesty.

   Praise him with the sound of the trumpet, praise him with psaltery and
   harp.

   Praise him with timbrel and choir, praise him with stringed instruments
   and organ.

   Praise him with well-tuned cymbals, praise him with loud cymbals. Let
   everything that hath breath praise the Lord.

   OST blessed art thou, Virgin Mother of

   God, for by him that was incarnate of thee hades hath been led captive,
   Adam hath been recalled, the curse hath been made void, Eve hath been
   set free, death hath died and we have been made alive. Wherefore
   praising thee we cry, Blessed art thou, O Christ our God, who so willed
   it, glory to thee.

   This Verse is sung on Sundays only. On other days they sing the proper
   appointed Verse.

   Then saith the Priest, Glory to thee who hast shewed light unto us. And
   the Choir singeth the Great Doxology.

   LORY to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill to men. We
   hymn thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we give
   thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord, King of heaven, God the
   Father almighty, O Lord, only-begotten Son, Jesu Christ, and O Holy
   Ghost. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, thou that takest
   away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou that

   O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us, like as we do put our trust in
   thee.

   Blessed art thou, O Lord, O teach me thy statutes, thrice.

   Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation. I have
   said, O Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned
   against thee.

   Lord, I flee unto thee. Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.
   For in thee is the fountain of life, in thy light shall we see light. O
   continue forth thy loving mercy to them that know thee.

   Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy upon us,

   Then Psalm 50 (51). Vide page 29.

   After this shall be sung the Canon to the Holy Trinity according to the
   Tone.

   At the conclusion of the Canon follow these verses of Gregory of Sinai.

   ON SUNDAYS. 47

   T is very meet to praise the super-divine Trinity, the unbeginning
   Father and Creator of all things, and the co-unbeginning Word, who was
   unspeakably begotten of the Father before all time, and the Holy Ghost
   proceeding from the Father from eternity.

   It is very meet to glorify thee, O God the Word, before whom the
   Cherubim fear and tremble, and whom the heavenly Hosts glorify. Let us
   glorify with fear Christ the Life-giver, who rose the third day from
   the dead.

   Let us all, with divine songs becoming unto God, sing the Father, and
   the Son, and the Divine Spirit, the tri-personal Might, the one Kingdom
   and Lordship.

   Thee that all the earth-born sing and heavenly Powers glorify, by all
   things art faithfully worshipped, O Unity in essence and tri-personal.

   O '&gt; sovereign Lord of Cherubim and in-comparable divine King of
   Seraphim, O un-

   divided Trinity in Unity, thou divinely ruling

   Essence, we magnify thee.

   1 '&gt; worship the unbeginning Father and God,

   and the co-unbeginning Word, with the Spirit.

   The undivided Oneness, the united Essence, the

   tri-numbered Unity, let us honour with songs.

   Let thy radiant splendour illuminate me,

   48 NOCTURNS

   O my God, tri-personal Maker of all things, and make me the
   dwelling-place of thine unapproachable glory, thou that art light, and
   light-bearing, and unchangeable.

   Him before whom the Cherubim fear and tremble, and angel Hosts glorify,
   of the Virgin unspeakably became incarnate, even Christ the Life-giver,
   whom with fear let us glorify.

   Trisagion. O most holy Trinity. Our Father. The Hypaco?Â´ of the Tone.
   Lord, have mercy, forty times. Glory. Both now. The more honourable
   .... In the name of the Lord, father, give the blessing.

   Priest. God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and shine the light of
   his countenance upon us, and have mercy upon us.

   Reader. Amen. And saith the following Prayer.

   OMNIPOTENT and quickening and light-originating holy Trinity, who, by
   thy goodness alone, hast from nothing produced all creatures visible
   and invisible, and providest for them and dost keep them, and among
   other thine unspeakable bounties to mankind dost grant us, even until
   death, repentance on account of our carnal weakness; leave thou not us
   to die condemned in our evil deeds, neither to be the scorn of the
   author of evil, of the envious one,

   ON SUNDAYS. 49

   of the destroying one. Thou seest, O Bountiful One, on the one hand his
   snares and enmity against us, and on the other our passions, weakness
   and forgetfulness. But we pray thee that thy merciful grace may be
   granted unto us, who offend thee every day and hour by transgressing
   thy holy and life-giving commandments. And pardon and forgive us all
   wherein we have sinned during our past life, and until the present
   hour, in deed and word and intention. And grant that we may finish the
   remaining time of our life in repentance and contrition, and in
   obedience to thy holy precepts. If, captivated by pleasure, we have
   sinned in divers manners, or, deceived by wicked desires, useless and
   harmful, we have been overcome; if, excited by anger and foolish
   passion, we have injured our brother; if we have bound ourselves by our
   tongue in inevitable, injurious and strong snares; if, by any of our
   senses or by all, willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly,
   by surprise or habit, we have foolishly transgressed; if, by evil and
   vain imaginations, we have defiled our conscience, and if in any other
   manner, by evil chance or custom, we have sinned; do thou pardon and
   forgive us, O most Compassionate, most Good and most Merciful One, and
   grant us future watchfulness and strength to do according

   50 THE NOCTURNS

   to thy good and acceptable and perfect will. Let nightly and dark evil
   deeds be changed to shining repentance, and so, walking honestly as in
   the day, may we, though unworthy, be found clean before thee, O Lover
   of mankind, and praise and magnify thee for ever. Amen.

   Here followeth the Dismissal.

   Priest. Glory to thee, O Christ, our God, our Hope, glory to thee.

   Reader. Glory. Both now. Lord, have mercy, thrice. Give the blessing.

   Priest. Christ our true God, through the prayers of his all-pure
   Mother, of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles, of Saint N.,

   For them that lie in sickness.

   Let us also pray for plentifulness of the fruits of the earth.

   And for every Orthodox Christian soul.

   Let us bless pious kings.

   Orthodox bishops.

   The founders of this holy Monastery.

   Our parents, and teachers, and all our before-departed fathers and
   brethren, that lie here, and the Orthodox everywhere. And let us say
   for them, Lord, have mercy.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy, thrice.

   Priest. Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, O Lord Jesus Christ
   our God, have mercy upon us.

   Choir. Amen.

   IV. THE GREAT MATINS

   Refuge terrible in strength, and that cannot be put to confusion,
   Mother of God, good and all-praised; confirm the estate of the
   Orthodox. Preserve our God-fearing Sovereign (Emperor, or, King, or,
   Queen, or, Prince) N., whom thou hast chosen to rule, and give him the
   victory from heaven; for thou, the blessed one, didst bring forth God.

   Priest. Have mercy upon us, O God, according to thy great mercy, we
   pray thee, hear and have mercy.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy, thrice. And so after the succeeding petitions.

   Priest. Again let us pray for our Godfearing and God-protected

   country) N.

   Again let us pray for (the most holy Governing Synod, or, our

   of the day. These being ended, the Reader saith the Tranquil Light, and
   the proper Prokimenon is sung. Vide page 9. Then immediately, without
   Ectenia preceding, the Prayer, Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this
   evening ....

   Then the Ectenia, Let us accomplish our evening prayer .... Vide page

   After this are sung the proper Stichera of the Day. And the Reader then
   readeth the

   Prayer of S. Simeon, Trisagion, &c. After the Our Father followeth the
   Troparion of the Day.

   Then is said the Great Ectenia, Have mercy upon us, O God ....Vide page
   10.

   After the Ectenia the Dismissal is given, as at the close of the Great
   Matins. Vide page 42.

   Then is read the following Prayer of Basil the Great.

   LESSED art thou, O Lord almighty, who hast lit up the day with the
   sun's light and brightened the night with shining stars, who hast
   granted unto us to pass the length of the day and to reach the limits
   of night. Hearken unto our prayer, and to that of all thy people, and
   forgive us all our voluntary and involuntary sins. Accept our evening
   prayers, and send down the riches of thy mercies and bounties upon
   thine estate. Guard us, as with a wall, by thy holy Angels. Arm us with
   the armour of righteousness. Preserve us by thy truth. Save us by thy

   and imaginings of evil, through the prayers of the holy Mother of God
   and of all the Saints who from ages have found favour before thee.

   NOTE I. In the Fasts, and on Days of Remembrance for the Departed, the

   58 THE LITTLE DAILY VESPERS.

   Then followeth the Ectenia, Let us accomplish our evening prayer
   ....Vide page 12.

   After this the Stichera, with which the following verses are said.

   U

   NTO thee have I lifted up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in heaven.
   Behold, as the eyes of a servant are towards the hand of his master and
   the eyes of a maidservant are towards the hand of her mistress, so our
   eyes are towards the Lord our God until he have mercy upon us.

   Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us; for we have been
   greatly filled with contempt. Our souls have been exceedingly filled
   with the reproach of the rich and the contempt of the proud.

   Then the Prayer of S. Simeon. Trisagion.

   O most holy Trinity. Our Father. And the

   following Troparia are sung.

   H

   AIL! Virgin Mother of God, O Mary,

   full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

   Blessed art thou among women, and blessed

   is the fruit of thy womb; for thou hast

   borne the Saviour of our souls.

   O Baptist of Christ, remember us all, that we may be saved from our
   iniquity; for to thee hath been given grace to pray for us.

   Glory.

   Pray for us, ye holy Apostles, aud all ye

   THE LITTLE DAILY VESPERS.

   59

   Saints, that we may be saved from danger and sorrow; for in you we have
   warm advo-cates before our Saviour. Both now.

   To thy protection we betake ourselves, O Mother of God. Despise not our
   prayers in our necessities, but save us from dangers, thou all-pure,
   all-blessed one.

   Reader. Lord, have mercy, forty times.

   Glory. Both now. The more honourable...

   In the name of the Lord, father, give the blessing.

   Priest. Blessed be Christ our God, always, now and ever, and to ages of
   ages.

   Reader. Amen. O heavenly King, stablish our faithful Sovereign, confirm
   the faith, quiet the heathen, give peace to the world, place our
   departed fathers and brethren in the tabernacles of the just, and
   accept us sorrowers and penitents; for thou art good and the Lover of
   men.

   Then we all bow down lowly to the earth three times, while the Priest
   prayeth

   The Prayer of S Ephrem the Syrian.

   ORD and Master of my life, give me not the spirit of indolence,
   despair, ambition and vain speaking.

   Genuflection.

   But rather the spirit of chastity, humble-

   60 THE LITTLE DAILY VESPERS,

   mindedness, patience and love do thou grant unto me, thy servant.

   Genuflection.

   Yea, O Lord King, let me see my own faults, and let me not judge my
   brother; for thou art blessed to ages of ages. Amen.

   Genuflection.

   Now all bow, but not so lowly, twelve times, and every time say,

   O God, cleanse me, a sinner.

   Then again the entire Prayer,

   Lord and Master of my life .... And one lowly Genuflection.

   Then followeth, Trisagion. O most holy Trinity. Our Father. Lord, have
   mercy, twelve times. And the Dismissal as at Noc-turns. Vide page 50.

   And the Prayer of S. Basil, as at page 56, is read.

   NOTE 2. So endeth the Vespers in the ordinary Fasts, but in the Great
   Quadragesima, after the Our Father and Lord, have mercy, twelve times,
   the following Prayer is read,

   MOST holy Trinity, that art might in one substance and kingdom undi-
   vided, be gracious unto me, a sinner. Confirm and instruct my heart,
   and take from me all my defilement. Illuminate my thoughts, that I may
   ever praise, sing and

   worship, and say, One holy, one Lord Jesus Christ to the glory of God
   the Father. Amen.

   B

   LESSED be the name of the Lord, from henceforth and to all ages,
   thrice. Glory. Both now.

   Then Psalms 33 (34) and 144 (145). And in conclusion.

   T is very meet to bless thee, the holy Virgin, the ever blessed, the
   entirely spotless, and Mother of our God. The more honourable than the
   Cherubim, and incomparably more glorious than the Seraphim, who didst
   bear without corruption God the Word, thee, verily the Mother of God,
   we magnify.

   And the Dismissal and the Prayer of S. Basil as before indicated.

   And now in the Great Fasts shall be read the Great, but in ordinary
   times, the Little Compline.

   VI. THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   and be discomfited.

   For God is with us. These words are repeated after every verse.

   Hear ye, even to the ends of the earth.

   THB GREAT COMPLINE. style='mso-tab-count: 1'&gt; 63

   Though ye were strong ye were made weak.

   And if again ye shall strengthen yourselves, again ye shall be
   discomfited.

   And if ye take counsel and devise it, the Lord shall scatter it.

   And the word which ye shall speak, it shall not stand with you.

   And we will not be afraid of your terror, neither will we be troubled.

   But we will hallow the Lord our God, and he shall be our fear.

   And if I trust in him, he will be to my sanctification.

   And I will trust in him, and I shall be saved by him.

   Behold me, and the children that God hath given me.

   The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light.

   To us that dwell in a far country and in the shadow of death light is
   sprung up.

   For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given.

   And the government shall be upon his shoulder.

   And there shall be no end of his peace.

   And his name shall be called the Angel of the Great Counsel,

   The wonderful Counsellor,

   64 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   The mighty God, the Potentate, the Prince of peace,

   The Father of the world to come.

   God is with us. Let the nations know and be discomfited.

   Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.

   God is with us. Let the nations know and be discomfited.

   Both now, and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   God is with us. Let the nations know and be discomfited.

   Likewise the following Troparia.

   I

   HAVE passed through the day and I thank

   thee, O Lord, and I pray that the evening and the night may be sinless.
   Grant me this, O Redeemer, and save me.

   Glory.. I have come through the day and I praise thee, O Master, and I
   pray that the evening and the night may be void of offence. Grant me
   this, O Redeemer, and save me.

   Both now. I have finished the day and I sing to thee, O Holy One, and I
   pray that the evening and the night may be guileless. Grant me this, O
   Redeemer, and save me.

   Then they sing,

   T

   HE bodiless powers of Cherubim praise

   thee with loudest songs. The six-winged

   living Seraphim extol thee with ceaseless

   THE GREAT COMPLINE style=" 65

   voices. And all the hosts of Angels sing thrice-holy hymns to thee. For
   thou, O Father, wast from everlasting, and with thee is thine
   unbeginning Son, and from thee cometh the living Spirit, and the
   Oneness of the Trinity is shewn. Most holy Virgin Mother of God, ye
   witnesses and servants of the Word, ye choirs of Prophets and of
   Martyrs who have found eternal life, pray earnestly for us, for we are
   all in need, that evil beset us not, so we may sing the Angels' hymn, O
   holy, holy, holy, thrice-holy Lord, save us, and have mercy on us.
   Amen.

   And now shall be said the Confession of the Faith.

   BELIEVE in one God, the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and
   of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the
   only-begotten Son of God, who was begotten of the Father before all
   ages, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made,
   consubstantial with the Father, by whom all things were made; Who for
   us men, and for our salvation, come down from the heavens, and was
   incarnate of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, and was made man; And
   was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was
   buried; And rose again

   66 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   the third day according to the Scriptures; And ascended into the
   heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And shall come
   again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead, of whose kingdom
   there shall be no end. And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, the Giver of
   life, who proceedeth from the Father, who with the Father and the Son
   is together worshipped and glorified, who spake by the Prophets. In
   one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one Baptism
   for the remission of sins. I look for the Resurrection of the dead, And
   the life in the ages to come. Amen.

   After the Confession of Faith, these Verses

   O

   MOST holy Lady, Mother of God, pray for us sinners.

   All ye heavenly hosts of holy Angels and Archangels, pray for us
   sinners.

   Ye holy and glorious Apostles, Prophets and Martyrs, and all ye Saints,
   pray for us, sinners,

   Ye our venerable and God-bearing Fathers, Pastors and Teachers of the
   world, pray for us sinners.

   O thou invincible, incomprehensible and divine might of the honourable
   and life-giving Cross, forsake us not sinners.

   O God, cleanse us sinners.

   THE GREAT COMPLINE. 67

   O God, cleanse us sinners, and have mercy upon us.

   Then, Trisagion. O most holy Trinity. Our Father. And the Troparion of
   the Festival.

   But if not a Festival, the following. On Monday and Wednesday Evenings.

   L

   IGHTEN mine eyes, O Christ my God, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
   lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him.

   Glory..

   O God, be the defender of my soul, for I walk in the midst of many
   snares. Deliver me from these and save me, O good Lover of mankind.

   Both now.

   As we have not daring on account of our many sins, do thou, O Virgin
   Mother of God, pray him that was born of thee. For thy maternal prayer
   availeth much to gain the clemency of the Lord. Despise not, O most
   pure one, the prayers of sinners, for he that vouchsafed to suffer for
   us is merciful and powerful to save.

   But on Tuesday and Thursday Evenings.

   L

   ORD, thou knowest the watchfulness of

   mine invisible enemies, and thou who

   madest me seest the weakness of my flesh

   68 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   Therefore into thine hands do I commit inspirit. Keep me under the
   shadow of the wings of thy goodness, lest I sleep the sleep of death.
   Enlighten the eyes of my mind with thy divine words, and in due time
   awaken me to praise thee, O good Lover of mankind.

   Verse. Look upon me and have mercy upon me, O Lord my God.

   How fearful shall thy judgment be, O Lord, when Angels stand around and
   men be there, when the books be opened and our actions shewn, and our
   intentions tried. What then shall be my sentence, for I was born in
   sin? Who shall quench the flame for me? Who shall make my darkness
   light, if thou, O Lord, the Lover of mankind, do not have mercy

   on me?

   Glory..

   Give to me tears, O God, as once thou gavest to the sinful woman, and
   let me wash thy feet therewith, thy feet that saved me from the path of
   sin. And let me cleanse my life with penitence, and so bring thee
   fragrant myrrh. And let me hear thy sacred words, Go thou in peace, thy
   faith hath made thee whole.

   Both now.

   O Mother of God, I have an unashamed trust in thee and shall be saved.
   I have

   THE GREAT COMPLINE. 69

   thine help, most pure one, and have no fear. I shall chase mine enemies
   and subdue them, with thy protection for my armour. And asking for thy
   mighty help I say, Save me, O Lady, by thy prayers, and rouse me from
   darkly sleep to praise thee, through the might of God the Son, who took
   his flesh from thee.

   Lord, have mercy, forty times. Glory. Both now. The more honourable
   .... In the name of the Lord, father, give the blessing.

   Priest. Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, O Lord Jesus Christ
   our God, have mercy upon us.

   Reader. Amen.

   Prayer of Basil the Great.

   ORD, O Lord, who savest us from every arrow that flieth by day, save us
   from every danger that lurketh in darkness. Accept the lifting up of
   our hands as an evening sacrifice. Let us pass through the watches of
   the night without defilement and without temptation, and deliver us
   from restlessness and fear of the devil. Let the repentance of our
   souls and the examination of our intentions in the light of thy
   terrible and righteous judgment be pleasing before thee. Penetrate our
   flesh with fear of thee,

   70 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   and mortify our earthly members, so that in our sleep we may be
   enlightened with the vision of thy judgment. Remove far from us every
   unseemly imagination and every harmful lust. And rouse us at the hour
   of prayer, strengthened in faith and advanced in thy commandments.
   Through the satisfaction and goodness of thine only-begotten Son, with
   whom, and with thy most holy, and good, and life-creating Spirit, thou
   art blessed, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   Then forthwith, O come, let us worship.... thrice.

   Psalms 50 (51) and 101 (102).

   And the Prayer of Manasses, King of Juda.

   LORD almighty, God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and of
   their righteous seed; who hast made heaven and earth, with all the
   ornament thereof; who hast bound the sea by the word of thy
   commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible
   and glorious name; whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; for
   the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening
   toward sinners is importable; but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable
   and unsearchable; for thou art the most high

   THE GREAT COMPLINE. '&gt; 71

   Lord, of great compassion, long-suffering, very merciful, and repentest
   of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness,
   hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned
   against thee; and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance
   unto sinners, that they may be saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art
   the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to
   Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but
   thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner; for I have
   sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O
   Lord, are multiplied; my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not
   worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine
   iniquities. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up
   mine head, neither have any release; for I have provoked thy wrath, and
   done evil before thee; I did not thy will, neither kept I thy
   commandments; I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences.
   Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. I
   have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities.
   Wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and
   destroy me not

   72 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   with mine iniquities. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil
   for me; neither condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. For thou
   art the God, even the God of them that repent; and in me thou wilt shew
   all thy goodness; for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to
   thy great mercy. Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of
   my life. For all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and thine is
   the glory to ages of ages. Amen.

   Trisagion, &c. After, Our Father, the following Troparia.

   H

   AVE mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us; for knowing not what to
   say, we sinners offer this to thee, our Master, this one prayer, Have
   mercy upon us.

   Glory.

   O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we have put our trust in thee. Be not
   very angry with us and remember not our transgressions; but look down
   upon us now as ever mercifully, and deliver us from our enemies. For
   thou art our God, and we are thy people: all of us are the work of thy
   hands, and we call upon thy name.

   Both now.

   O blessed Mother of God, open unto us the gates of mercy, that,
   trusting in thee, we

   perish not, but be delivered from evils by thee, for thou art the
   salvation of the Christian race.

   Lord, have mercy, forty times. Glory.. Both now. The more honourable

   Priest. Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, O Lord Jesus Christ
   our God, have mercy upon us. Reader. Amen.

   Prayer.

   ASTER, God, Father almighty; Lord, only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, and
   Holy Ghost, one God-head, one Might I be gracious unto me, a sinner;
   and, by ways thou knowest, save me, thine unworthy servant; for thou
   art blessed to ages of ages. Amen.

   Then again, O come, let us worship ....

   thrice. Psalms 69 (70) and 142 (143).

   And the Doxology.

   LORY to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men.
   We hymn thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we give
   thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord, King of heaven, God the
   Father almighty, O Lord, only-begotten Son, Jesu Christ, and O Holy

   74 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   Ghost. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, thou that takest
   away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us; thou that takest away
   the sins of the world, accept our prayer; thou that sittest on the
   right hand of the Father, have mercy upon us. For thou only art holy,
   thou only art Lord, O Jesu Christ, to the glory of God the Father.
   Amen.

   Every evening will I bless thee, and praise thy name to ages, and to
   ages of ages.

   Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation. I have
   said, O Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned
   against thee. Lord, I flee unto thee, teach me to do thy will, for thou
   art my God. For in thee is the fountain of life, in thy light shall we
   see light. O continue forth thy loving-mercy to them that know thee.

   Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this evening without sin. Blessed art
   thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and praised and glorified is thy name
   to ages. Amen.

   O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us, like as we do put our trust in
   thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord, O teach me thy statutes. Blessed art
   thou, O Master, make me to understand thy statutes. Blessed art thou, O
   Holy One, enlighten me with thy statutes.

   THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   75

   O Lord, thy mercy endureth for ever, despise not thou the works of
   thine own hands. To thee is due praise, to thee is due a hymn, to thee
   is due glory, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages of
   ages. Amen.

   Then is sung the Canon of the Day.

   At its conclusion, Trisagion, &c. Our Father. And the following Verses
   are sung antiphonally.

   O

   LORD of hosts, be thou with us, for we have no other help but thee in
   sorrows. O Lord of hosts have mercy on us, twice.

   Praise God in his Saints, praise him in the firmament of his power. O
   Lord of hosts, be thou with us.

   Praise him for his mighty acts, praise him according to the greatness
   of his majesty. O Lord of hosts, be thou with us.

   Praise him with the sound of the trumpet, praise him with psaltery and
   harp. O Lord of hosts, be thou with us.

   Praise him with timbrel and choir, praise him with stringed instruments
   and Organ. O Lord of hosts, be thou with us.

   Praise him with well-tuned cymbals, praise him with loud cymbals. Let
   everything that hath breath praise the Lord. O Lord of hosts, be thou
   with us.

   76 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   Praise God in his Saints. O Lord of hosts, be thou with us.

   Praise him in the firmament of his power.

   O Lord of hosts, be thou with us.

   Glory.. O Lord, if we had not thy Saints to pray for us, and thy
   goodness so merciful to us, how could we dare, O Saviour, to sing to
   thee, whom Angels unceasingly glorify? O thou that knowest the hearts,
   spare our souls.

   Both now. O Mother of God, to thee do

   I approach on account of the great mul-

   titude of my transgressions, desiring salva-

   tion. Visit thou my ailing soul, and beseech

   thy Son and our God to grant me remission

   of the evil I have wrought, for thou art the

   blessed one.

   O most holy Mother of God, forsake me not during the course of my life,
   give me not over to the intercession of man, but thyself protect and
   have mercy upon me.

   All my trust do I place in thee, O Mother of God, keep me under thy
   protection. Reader. Lord, have mercy, forty times.

   And this Prayer.

   HOU that in all times and at every hour, in heaven and upon earth, art
   worshipped and glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, most merciful and
   of great tenderness, who lovest the righteous and

   THE GREAT COMPLINE. 77

   art merciful to sinners, who hast called all men to salvation by the
   promise of future blessings; do thou, O Lord, accept our prayers at
   this hour, and guide our life in thy commandments. Sanctify our souls,
   make chaste our bodies, govern our thoughts, purify our intentions, and
   deliver us from every affliction and pain, and from all evil. Surround
   us by thy holy Angels, that, preserved and guided by their hosts, we
   may come to the unity of the faith, and to the knowledge of thine
   inaccessible glory; for blessed art thou to ages of ages. Amen.

   Lord, have mercy, thrice. Glory. Both now. The more honourable than the
   Cherubim.... In the name of the Lord, father, give the blessing.

   Priest. God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and shine the light of
   his countenance upon us, and have mercy upon us.

   Then the Prayer of S. Ephrem, with the Genuflections. Vide page 59.

   After this the Reader saith Trisagion, &c. After the Our Father
   followeth Lord, have mercy, twelve times, and this Prayer to the Mother
   of God.

   THOU Virgin, spotless, undefiled, in corruptible, most chaste and pure,
   Lady, Bride of God, who by thy glorious giving birth hast united God
   the Word with men,

   78 THE GREAT COMPLINE.

   and linked our apostate nature with heavenly things; who art the one
   hope of the hopeless, the helper of the oppressed, the ready protection
   of them that flee unto thee, and the refuge of all Christians; despise
   not me, a defiled sinner, who, by my impious thoughts, words and deeds,
   have made myself an unprofitable servant, and, by reason of my sloth,
   am become a slave of sensual life. But thou, O Mother of the man-loving
   God, have mercy and compassion upon me, a sinner and a prodigal. Accept
   this my prayer offered unto thee by unhallowed lips, and using thy
   maternal influence with thy Son, our Lord and Master, beseech him to
   open unto me the loving tenderness of his grace, and, despising my
   numberless transgressions, to bring me to repentance, and make me a
   zealous doer of his commandments. Be ever present with me, as the
   merciful, compassionate, good and loving helper and advocate in this
   present life, turning aside the assaults of enemies and guiding me unto
   salvation. And at the hour of my death preserve my miserable soul, and
   drive far from it all dark visions of evil demons. Deliver me on the
   terrible day of judgment from everlasting punishment, and make me an
   inheritor of the unspeakable glory of thy Son, our God. Grant me to
   obtain this,

   THE GREAT COMPLINE. 79

   O most holy Lady and Mother of God through thine intercession and
   protection, by the grace and loving-kindness of thine only-begotten
   Son, our Lord, God, and Saviour, Jesus Christ, to whom with his Father

   ages. Amen.

   Prayer to the Lord Jesus Christ.

   ND grant unto us, O Master, now retiring to sleep, repose of body and
   soul, and keep us from the dark sleep of sin, and from every dark and
   nightly lust Subdue our unruly passions, and quench the fiery darts of
   the evil one that are treacherously thrown against us. Quell the
   commotions of our flesh, and lull our earthly and sinful thoughts to
   sleep. And give unto us, O God, a watchful mind, pure thoughts, a
   temperate heart, and quiet sleep free from every illusion of Satan. And
   rouse us at the hour of prayer confirmed in thy commandments, and with

   Vide page 50.

   Then all depart, and say this Prayer.

   LORD, forgive them that hate and injure us. Do good to them that do
   good to us. To our brethren and kinsfolk grant their desires for
   salvation and eternal life. Visit them that are in sickness and heal
   them. Guide them that are on the sea. Journey with the travellers. War
   with our Emperor (or, King, or, Queen, or, Prince, according to the
   country). To them

   THE GREAT COMPLINE style=" 81

   that minister and are beneficent unto us grant forgiveness of sins.
   According to thy great mercy, have mercy upon them that have desired
   us, unworthy ones, to pray for them. Remember, O Lord, our fathers and
   brethren that have fallen asleep before us, and give them rest where
   the light of thy countenance shineth. Remember, O Lord, our brethren
   that are in captivity, and deliver them from all their bonds. Remember,
   O Lord, them that bring forth fruit and do good works in thy holy
   Churches, and grant them their desires for salvation and eternal life.
   Remember us also, O Lord, thine humble, sinful and unworthy servants;
   and enlighten our minds with the light of thy knowledge, and guide us
   in the way of thy commandments. Through the prayers of our most holy

   Have mercy upon me, O God .... Vide page 29.

   Psalm 69 (70).

   GOD, come to mine assistance : O Lord, make haste to help me. Let them
   be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul. Let them be turned
   backward and put to confusion that wish me evil. Let them be turned
   back instantly and put to shame that cry over me, There, there. But let
   all that seek thee, O God, rejoice and be glad in thee. And let them
   that love thy salvation say alway, The Lord be magnified. But I am poor
   and in misery : O God, help me. Thou art my

   helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

   The Confession of Faith. Vide page 65.

   It is very meet to bless thee .... Vide page 61.

   Trisagion, &c. After Our Father, the Condakion of the Day. Or they say

   O

   GOD of our Fathers, who ever dealest

   with us according to thy clemency; remove not thy mercy from us, but,
   by their intercessions, direct our life in peace.

   Thy Church, clad in beautiful raiment with

   the blood of thy Martyrs in all the world,

   as with purple and fine linen, through them

   crieth unto thee, O Christ our God, Send

   down thy bounties upon thy people, give

   peace to thine estate, and great mercy to

   our souls. Glory.

   O Christ, rest the souls of thy servants

   with the Saints, where there is no sickness,

   nor sadness, nor sighing, but life without

   ending. Both now.

   Through the prayers, O Lord, of all the Saints, and of the Mother of
   God, grant us

   Venerables and Just, who have wrought

   a good work, have kept the faith, and have

   daring with the Saviour; we entreat you,

   O ye blessed ones, to pray for the salvation

   of our souls. Glory..

   O Christ, rest the souls .... As before written. Both now.

   To thee, O Lord, the Author of creation, the world bringeth the
   God-bearing Martyrs as the first-fruits of nature. At their
   intercessions, through the Mother of God, preserve, O most Merciful
   One, thy Church and thine estate in perfect peace.

   Lord, have mercy, forty times.

   The Prayer. Thou that at all times .... Vide page 76.

   followeth, and the rest, as in the Great Compline.

   III. THE DAILY NOCTURNS.

   The beginning is the same as in the Sun- day Nocturns until the end of
   Psalm 50 (51). Then followeth the 17th Kathism of the Psalter on every
   day but Saturday, and on Saturday the 9th Kathism.

   After the Kathism is said the Confession of Faith. Then, Trisagion, &c.
   After Our Father, the following Troparia, except on Saturday.

   EHOLD the Bridegroom cometh in the middle of the night, and blessed is
   that servant whom he shall find watching, but unworthy he whom he shall
   find careless. Beware then, my soul, lest thou be weighed down by
   sleep, lest thou be given over to death and be shut out from the
   kingdom; but awake, crying, Holy, holy, holy art thou, O God. Through
   the Mother of God, have mercy upon us. Glory.,

   86 THE DAILY NOCTURNS.

   While meditating, O my soul, upon that

   fearful day, keep watch, lighting thy lamp

   and feeding it with oil; for thou knowest

   not when the voice shall come that crieth,

   Behold the Bridegroom. Beware then, my

   soul, lest thou slumber, lest thou remain

   knocking without, like the five virgins. But

   persevere in watchfulness, that thou mayest

   meet Christ with rich oil, and that he may

   open to thee the divine bridechamber of his

   glory. Both now.

   O God-bearing Virgin, that art an un-taken wall, a fortress of
   salvation, to thee we pray, Destroy the counsel of adversaries, turn
   the grief of thy people into joy, protect thy city, war with our
   Emperor (or, King, or, Queen, or, Prince) N., intercede for the peace
   of the world. For thou, O Mother of God, art our hope.

   And on Saturday they say,

   O

   UNCREATED Nature, Author of all

   things, open our lips to declare thy praise and cry, Holy, holy, holy
   art thou, O God. Through the Mother of God, have mercy upon us.

   Glory..

   Imitating upon earth the Hosts above, to thee, O Blessed One, we offer
   the triumphal hymn, Holy, holy, holy art thou, O God.

   THE DAILY NOCTURNS. 87

   Through the Mother of God, have mercy upon us.

   Both now.

   Thou hast aroused me from my bed and from sleep, O Lord. And now
   enlighten my mind and heart, and open my lips to sing to thee, O holy
   Trinity, Holy, holy, holy art thou, O God. Through the Mother of God,
   have mercy upon us.

   Lord, have mercy, forty times.

   The Prayer. Thou that in all times .... Vide page 76.

   Lord, have mercy, thrice. Glory. Both now. The more honourable. Give
   the blessing. This the Priest giveth. [And in the Fasts the Prayer of
   S. Ephrem is said here, with the Genuflections.]

   And now shall be said the following Prayers.

   First Prayer.

   Master, God, Father almighty .... Vide pape 73.

   Second Prayer. [Said only from September 22 until Palm Sunday.]

   LORD almighty, God of hosts and of all flesh, who dwellest on high and
   lookest down on the humble, who searchest the hearts and reins, and
   foreseest

   88 THE DAILY NOCTURNS.

   clearly things hidden unto men, Light without beginning and
   everlasting, with whom is no variableness nor the shadow of turning;
   thyself, O immortal King, accept the prayers which, trusting in the
   multitude of thy mercies, we dare to offer unto thee with our impure

   words and thoughts, knowingly and unknowingly. Cleanse us from every
   defilement of the flesh and spirit; and grant that we may, with
   watchful heart and sober mind, pass through all the night of our
   present life, awaiting the coming of the bright and appointed day of
   thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, in
   the which he shall come with glory to judge all men and render to every
   one according to his works, so that, neither lapsing nor slothful, but
   watchful and doing, we may be found prepared, and may enter into the
   joy and divine mansion of his glory, where unceasing is the voice of
   the feasting, and unspeakable the bliss of them that behold the
   infinite goodness of thy countenance. For thou art the true Light,
   which enlighteneth and sanctifieth all things, and all creation singeth
   thee to ages of ages. Amen.

   Third Prayer.

   E bless thee, O God most high and Lord of mercy, who ever doest amongst
   us great and unsearchable, glorious and terrible things, of which there
   is no number, and who grantest unto us sleep to rest our weakness and
   to relieve the labour of our toiling flesh. We give thee thanks that
   thou hast not destroyed us in our transgressions, but, in thy wonted
   love to man, hast raised us lying in despair to glorify thy power.
   Therefore we pray thee of thine unmeasurable goodness to enlighten our
   thoughts and our eyes, and to raise our minds from the heavy sleep of
   sloth. Open our lips and fill them with thy praise, that we may
   continually sing and give thanks unto thee, O God, the unbeginning
   Father, who in all things and by all things, together with thine
   only-begotten Son, and thy most holy, and good, and life-creating
   Spirit, art glorified, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   Second and concluding Prayer for Saturdays.

   WILL magnify thee exceedingly, O Lord, because thou hast regarded my
   lowliness and hast not delivered me up into the hands of mine enemies,
   but hast

   90 THE DAILY NOCTURNS.

   saved my soul out of necessities. And now, O Master, let thy hand cover
   me and thy mercy come upon me, for my soul is troubled and afflicted
   concerning its departure from this mine accursed and defiled body, lest
   the evil counsel of the adversary meet and hinder it in the darkness
   because of the sins I have knowingly and unknowingly committed in this
   life. Be merciful unto me, O Master, and let it not behold the dark
   vision of evil demons, but let thy bright and shining Angels receive
   it. Give glory to thy holy name, and by thy power lead me to thy divine
   judgment-seat. When I am judged let not the hand of the prince of this
   world seize and drag me, a sinner, into the abyss of hades; but stand
   thou near me, and be unto me a Saviour and a Redeemer. For these bodily
   sufferings are joy unto thy servants. Have mercy, O Lord, upon my soul
   which is defiled with the passions of this life, and receive it
   purified through repentance and thanksgiving; for thou art blessed to
   ages of ages. Amen.

   After the Prayers, O come, let us worship .... thrice. Psalms 120 (121)
   and 133 (134). Glory. Both now.

   EMEMBER thy servants, O Lord, for thou art good, and forgive them their
   sins during life; for there is none sinless save thee, who art able to
   give rest unto the departed.

   Thou, the Creator, that in the depth of wisdom dost appoint all things
   in loving-kindness unto men, and dost grant unto them needful things;
   give rest, O Lord, unto the souls of thy servants; for in thee, our
   Maker, Author and God, they have put their trust.

   Glory.

   O Christ, rest the souls of thy servants with the Saints, where there
   is no sickness, nor sadness, nor sighing, but life without ending.

   Both now.

   All generations bless thee, O God-bearing Virgin; for in thee the
   Uncontainable, even Christ our God, vouchsafed to be contained, And we
   are also blessed who have thee for our mediatress; for day and night
   thou prayest for us, and the sceptres of the kingdom are strenghtened
   by thy prayers. Therefore, praising thee, we cry, Hail! full of grace,
   the Lord is with thee.

   Lord, have mercy, twelve times.

   And this Prayer.

   EMEMBER, O Lord, our fathers and brethren who sleep in hope of
   resurrection to eternal life, and all who have departed in piety and
   faith. And forgive them all their sins, voluntary and involuntary,
   which by deed, word, or intention, they have committed. And place them
   in shining, tranquil and refreshing places, whence are driven away all
   sickness, sadness and sighing, and where the light of thy countenance
   shineth and rejoiceth all thy Saints for ever. Grant unto them and unto
   us thy kingdom, and the communion of thine unspeakable and eternal
   blessings, and the enjoyment of thine endless and blissful life. For
   thou art the Resurrection, and the Life, and the Repose of thy sleeping
   servants, O Christ our God, and to thee we ascribe glory, with thine
   unbeginning Father, and thy most holy, and good, and life-creating
   Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   themselves.

   present. As thou wast always with thine Apostles, O Compassionate One,
   be thou with us who long for thee, that, being conjoined with thee, we
   may hymn and glorify thy most Holy Spirit. Both now.

   The hope and mediatress and refuge of Christians, the wall that cannot
   be overthrown, the harbour of the helpless unagitated by storms art
   thou, O most pure Bearer of God; but, as saving the world by thy
   ceaseless intercessions, remember us also, O all-celebrated Virgin.

   sins, O Christ our God; for thou wast pleased willingly to ascend the

   shew unto us thy wonted power; for, trusting in thee, we cry unto thee,
   Hail! as once did Gabriel the bodiless Chieftain.

   Lord, have mercy, forty times.

   And the Prayer, Thou that in all times.... Vide page 76.

   Closing Prayer of the Sixth Hour. Of Basil the Great.

   GOD and Lord of hosts, Maker of all creation, who, through the

   only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our
   race, and, through his honourable Cross, hast blotted out the
   handwriting of our sins, and triumphed over the princes and powers of
   darkness; thyself, O Lord, accept from us sinners these thankful and

   everlasting light, and, led thereby, shall ever pay unto thee our vows
   and thanksgiving, O unbeginning Father, with thine only-begotten Son,
   and thy most holy, and good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever,
   and to ages of ages. Amen.

   HOU that for our sakes wast born of the Virgin, and didst, O Blessed
   One, endure crucifixion, and by death didst spoil death, and, as God,
   didst shew forth the Resurrection; despise not us whom thine hands did

   that bore thee, the Mother of God, praying for us, and save, O our
   Saviour, thy despairing people.

   THE NINTH HOUR, OR NONE. I2I

   O cast us not away at the last for thy name's sake, neither annul thy
   testament, nor remove thy mercy from us; for the sake of Abraham thy

   us; mortify the lusts of our flesh, O Christ our God, and save us.

   HE thief, seeing the Prince of life hanging upon the Cross, exclaimed,
   If he who is crucified with us were not incarnate God, the sun would
   not hide his light, nor would the earth be moved. But, O thou
   all-enduring Lord, remember me in thy kingdom. Glory..

   In the midst of two thieves thy Cross appeared a balance of
   righteousness. On one side it sank to hades through the weight of
   blasphemy, on the other it rose from iniquity to divine knowledge. O
   Christ our God, glory to thee. Both now.

   Thy Mother seeing thee, the Lamb and Shepherd and Saviour of the world,
   upon the Cross, said with tears, Lo! the world rejoiceth, for it
   gaineth deliverance; but my heart is broken, for I see thy crucifixion,
   which for all thou endurest, O my Son and my God.

   Lord, have mercy, forty times.

   And the Prayer, Thou that in all times .... Vide page 76.

   upon the

   THE NINTH HOUR, OR NONE. I23

   life-giving tree, and shew the way into Paradise to the
   well-intentioned thief, and death by death didst overcome; do thou
   cleanse us, thy sinful and unworthy servants. For we have sinned and
   transgressed, and are unworthy to lift up our eyes and look unto the
   height of heaven, because we have forsaken the way of righteousness and
   walked according to the desires of our own hearts. But we beseech thee,
   O Lord, of thine immeasurable goodness to spare us according to the
   greatness of thy mercy, and to save us for thy holy name's sake, for
   our days have been consumed in vanity. Deliver us out of the hand of
   the enemy, and forgive our sins, and slay our fleshly lusts, so that,
   putting off the old man and putting on the new, we may henceforth live
   for thee, our Master and Benefactor, and, keeping thy commandments, may
   gain thine everlasting rest, the dwelling whereof is all gladness. For
   thou art verily the joy and gladness of them that love thee, O Christ
   our God, and to thee we ascribe glory, with thine unbe-ginning Father,
   and thy most holy, and good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever,
   and to ages of ages. Amen.

   XIV. THE PRO-LITURGY SERVICE,

   CALLED,

   THE TYPICA.

   This Service is said either in the Great Fasts, when the Hours are
   conjoined with the Vespers or with the Liturgy of the Pre-sanctified,
   or it is said on ordinary days when for some reason there is no
   celebration of the Liturgy. In the former instance, it serveth as a
   transition from the Morning to the Evening Service, and in the latter,
   it is a Service in itself instead of the prayers and hymns of the
   Liturgy.

   These two uses are indicated as followeth.

   A. THE TYPICA IN THE GREAT

   FASTS.

   After the Prayer of the Ninth Hour, Master, Lord Jesus Christ . . . .

   First Choir. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute
   you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.

   in heaven.

   or if we did them in our thought and purpose, forgive us all, for thou
   art good and lovest man.

   Our Father ....

   Then the Condakion for the Day. Lord, have mercy, forty times. Glory.
   Both now. In the name of the Lord, father, give the blessing.

   CALLED, THE TYPICA. '&gt; I27

   Priest. God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and shine the light of
   his countenance upon us, and have mercy upon us.

   And the Prayer of S. Ephrem followeth, and the Reader beginneth
   immediately the Vespers, saying, O come, let us worship .... Psalm 103
   (104). And the rest.

   B. THE TYPICA ON ORDINARY DAYS.

   At the conclusion of the Sixth Hour, the Reader beginneth,

   thou comest in thy kingdom, and save me, for thou alone art the Lover
   of men.

   Thou, O Christ, that didst accept the tears of Peter, accept also my
   repentance, and grant me forgiveness of my sins.

   Thou, O Christ, that dost enlighten the heavenly choirs, enlighten also
   the eyes of my heart.

   Thou didst preach repentance unto men, O Baptist and Precursor of the
   Lord: I pray thee to grant me to repent from my heart.

   O Christ, thou wast of thine own accord nailed on the tree, and by thy
   might hast overcome the arrogance of the proud.

   O glorious Apostles, as mysterious rays ye have penetrated the world,
   and with faith have enlightened the race of men.

   Thou, O Lover of men, who hast glorified Prophets, Teachers, Venerables
   and Just, save our souls by their prayers. Glory.

   We glorify the Father, and the Son, and

   CALLED, THE TYPICA. I29

   Palm Sunday; on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday; on the Festivals of
   Christmas and Epiphany, when falling on Sunday or Monday, otherwise on

   Priest. That being ever guarded by thy might, we may ascribe glory to

   The Cherubic Hymn.

   E, who the Cherubim represent in mystery, and to the life-giving
   Trinity offer in song the hymn thrice-holy, should now put away all
   cares of life,

   To receive the King of all, invisibly

   attended by the angelic Orders. Alleluia,

   alleluia, alleluia.

   During the singing of this Hymn, the Procession, called the Great
   Introit, is made, when the prepared Gifts are carried from the Table of
   Oblations to the Altar, and the Lord God is desired to remember the
   Sovereign, and all the members of the Reigning House, the most holy
   Governing Synod, the Bishop of the Diocese, and all Orthodox Christians

   F thy mysterious Supper to-day, O Son of God, accept me as a partaker;
   for I will not reveal thy Mystery to thine enemies, nor give thee a
   kiss as Judas, but as the thief I will confess thee, Remember me, O
   Lord, in thy kingdom.

   And on the Great Sabbath they sing,

   ET all flesh of man be silent, and let it stand in fear and awe, and
   think of nothing earthly to itself. For the King of kings and the Lord
   of lords cometh to be slain, and to be given as food to the faithful.
   Him do precede the angelic Hosts, with all their Principalities and
   Powers, the many-eyed Cherubim and the six-winged Seraphim, covering
   their faces, and singing the song, Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

   Then followeth the Ectenia of Supplication.

   Deacon. Let us accomplish our prayer to the Lord. Choir. Lord, have

   of ages. Choir. Amen.

   Priest. Peace to all. Choir. And to thy spirit.

   Choir. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Trinity consubstantial and
   undivided.

   Deacon. The doors, the doors! In wisdom let us attend!

   And we sing the Confession of the Faith, I believe in one God . . . .

   This being concluded, the Deacon saith,

   ET us stand worthily, let us stand with fear, let us attend to offer in
   peace the holy Oblation.

   Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with you all.

   Choir. And with thy spirit.

   Priest. Lift we up our hearts.

   Choir. We lift them up unto the Lord.

   Priest. Let us give thanks to the Lord.

   Choir. It is meet and right to worship the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
   the Trinity consubstantial and undivided.

   Priest. Singing, crying aloud, shouting, and saying the triumphal hymn,

   Choir. Holy, holy, holy Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of thy
   glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed be he that cometh in the name of
   the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.

   Priest. Take, eat, this is my Body, which is broken for you for the
   remission of sins.

   Choir. Amen.

   which is shed for you and for many for the remission of sins. Choir.
   Amen.

   Priest. Thine own of thine own we offer thee in behalf of all, and for
   all.

   Choir. Thee we hymn, thee we bless, to thee we give thanks, O Lord, and
   pray to thee, our God.

   I54 AT THE LITURGIES

   Priest. Especially for our most holy, most pure, most blessed glorious
   Lady, the God-bearing ever-virgin Mary.

   Choir. It is very meet to bless thee, the God-bearing one, the
   ever-blessed, the entirely spotless, and Mother of our God. The more
   honourable than the Cherubim, and incomparably more glorious than the
   Seraphim, who didst bear without corruption God the Word, thee, verily
   the God-bearing one, we magnify.

   But if the Liturgy of S. Basil be celebrated, they sing instead of the
   foregoing,

   I

   N thee, O full of grace, all creation re-joiceth, the hierarchy of
   Angels and the race of men, in thee, the sanctified temple, the
   spiritual paradise, the glory of virgins, of whom our God took flesh
   and became a child, even he that was God before the world. For he made
   thy womb his throne, and rendered it more extended than the heavens. In
   thee, O full of grace, all creation re-joiceth, glory to thee.

   And on the Great Festivals of the Year, they substitute in this place
   the Irmos of the Ninth Ode of their proper Canon at Matins, to wit,

   OF SAINTS CHRYSOSTOM AND BASIL. I55

   On Palm Sunday.

   T

   HE Lord is God, and hath appeared unto us. Come, let us keep the feast,
   and with gladness magnify Christ with palms and branches, crying in
   song, Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord our Saviour.

   On Easter Day, and in the Paschal Season.

   A

   N Angel cried to the one full of grace,

   Hail! Virgin pure. And again I say, Hail! For thy Son, after three
   days, hath risen from the grave and raised the dead. Rejoice, ye
   people. Shine, shine, O new Jerusalem; for the glory of the Lord hath
   shone on thee. Rejoice now and exult, O Sion. And thou, pure Mother of
   God, be glad in the Resurrection of him whom thou didst bear.

   On Pentecost Sunday.

   H

   A1L! thou, O Queen, most glorious Virgin

   Mother. For no well - speaking eloquent lips can worthily extol thee;
   and every mind is at a loss to understand thy bringing forth.
   Wherefore, with one accord we glorify thee.

   On Christmas Day.

   M

   AGNIFY, my soul, her who is more

   honourable and glorious than the Hosts above. A mystery strange and
   wondrous I

   I56 AT THE LITURGIES

   behold. The cave is heaven, the Virgin is the throne of Cherubim, the
   manger is the place where the Incomprehensible is laid, Christ our God,
   whom singing, we magnify.

   On the Epiphany.

   M

   AGNIFY, my soul, her who is more honourable and glorious than the Hosts
   above. O most pure Virgin, blessed Mother, the mystery of thy
   child-birth passeth thought, and by it we have gained a full salvation.
   Worthily we praise thee as our benefactress, and bring thee as a gift
   thanksgiving songs.

   The Hymn to the Mother of God being ended, the Priest exclaimeth,

   And chiefly, O Lord, remember the most holy Governing Synod (or, our
   Metropolitan, or, Archbishop, or, Bishop N.), the members of which (or,
   whom) preserve to thy holy Churches in peace, safety, honour, health,
   and length of days, and rightly dividing the word of thy truth.

   Choir. And all men, and all women.

   Priest. And grant us with one mouth and one heart to glorify and
   celebrate thine all-honourable and majestic name, of the Father, and of
   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen.

   OF SAINTS CHRYSOSTOM AND BASIL. I57

   Priest. And the mercies of the great

   God and our Saviour, Jesus Christ, be with you all.

   Choir. And with thy spirit.

   Deacon. Commemorating all the Saints, again and again in peace let us
   pray to the Lord.

   For the honourable Gifts now presented and hallowed, let us pray to the
   Lord.

   That our man-loving God, who hath received them on his holy, heavenly,
   and spiritual altar, as the odour of a sweet smelling spiritual
   perfume, may send down on us his divine grace, and the gift of the Holy
   Ghost, let us pray to the Lord.

   For our deliverance from all affliction ....

   Help us, save us ....

   That the whole day may be perfect ....

   And the rest of the Ectenia of Supplication, concluding,

   Having prayed for the unity of the faith, and the communion of the Holy
   Ghost, let us commend ourselves, and one another, and all our life to
   Christ, our God.

   Choir. To thee, O Lord.

   Priest. And make us worthy, O Master, with boldness, and without
   condemnation, to dare to call upon thee, our heavenly God and Father,
   and to say,

   I58 AT THE LITURGIES

   And we sing the Lord's Prayer.

   Choir. Amen.

   Priest. Peace to all. Choir. And to thy spirit.

   Deacon. Bow your heads to the Lord.

   Choir. To thee, O Lord. Exclamation.

   and life - creating Spirit, thou art blessed, now and ever, and to ages
   of ages.

   Choir. Amen.

   Deacon. Let us attend.

   Priest. Holy things for holy persons.

   [Now shall the Communicants, if there be any, receive the holy
   Sacrament.

   Prayer before Communion.

   BELIEVE, Lord, and confess that thou art truly Christ, the Son of the
   living God, who earnest into the

   world to save sinners, of whom I am the

   greatest.

   I

   BELIEVE also that this is thy most holy

   and immaculate Body, and this thy precious Blood. Wherefore, I beseech
   thee, Have mercy upon me, and pardon my transgressions, voluntary and
   involuntary, in word and in deed, in knowledge and in ignorance, and
   make me worthy, without condemnation, to partake of thy most pure
   Mysteries, for the remission of sins, and for life eternal.

   OF SAINTS CHRYSOSTOM AND BASIL. I6l

   R

   ECEIVE me to-day, O Son of God, as

   a partaker of thy mysterious Supper; for I will not betray this Mystery
   to thine enemies, nor give thee a kiss as Judas, but as the thief I
   will confess unto thee, Remember me, O Lord, in thy kingdom.

   L

   ET not the communion of thy holy Mys-

   teries be to my judgment, nor to my condemnation, but to the healing of
   my soul and body.

   And as the Priest giveth the holy Sacrament, he saith to each one,

   T

   HE servant (or, handmaid) of God, N.,

   partaketh of the precious and holy Body and Blood of our Lord, and God,
   and Saviour, Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of his sins, and for

   Meantime the Choir singeth,

   of the immortal Fount. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.]

   Priest. O God, save thy people, and bless thine inheritance.

   I62 AT THE LITURGIES

   Choir. We have seen the true Light, we have received the heavenly
   Spirit, we have found the true Faith, and we worship the undivided
   Trinity, which hath saved us.

   Priest. Always, now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen. And singeth,

   divine, immortal, and life-giving Mysteries. Preserve us by thy
   holiness all our days, that we may learn thy righteousness. Alleluia,
   alleluia, alleluia.

   But on the Great Festivals they sing their proper Troparion instead of

   Priest. Glory to thee, O Christ our God, our Hope, glory to thee.

   Choir. Glory. Both now. Lord, have mercy, thrice. Give the blessing.

   Priest. (He that arose from the dead, or, that vouchsafed to sit on the
   foal of an ass for our salvation, or, that sent down the most Holy
   Spirit in the likeness of fiery tongues upon his holy Disciples and
   Apostles, or, that vouchsafed to be born in a cave and laid in a manger
   for our salvation, or,

   OF SAINTS CHRYSOSTOM AND BASIL. 165

   that vouchsafed to be baptized by John in Jordan for our salvation,
   according to the occasion of the Festival), Christ our true God,
   through the prayers of his all-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and
   all-praised Apostles, of our Father in the Saints, John Chrysostom,
   Archbishop of Constantinople, (or, if his Liturgy be said, Basil the
   Great, of C?Â¶sarea in Cappadocia), and of all the Saints, have mercy
   upon us and save us, for he is good and the Lover of men.

   Choir. Lord, have mercy, thrice.

   And singeth the Many Years for the Reigning House.

   XVI. AT THE LITURGY OF THE PRE-SANCTIFIED.

   This Liturgy is said on the Wednesdays and Fridays of the first 6 Weeks
   of the Great Quadragesima, on the Thursday of the 5th. Week, and on the
   Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Holy Passion Week. It may also be
   said, excepting on Saturdays and Sundays and on the Festival of the
   Annunciation, on other days during the Fast, to wit, on those of
   Festivals and their Vigils, and on the Commemoration of the Dedication
   of the Church.

   The Office of the Typica being ended, as indicated at page 127, the
   Priest giveth the blessing, and the Reader beginneth the Vespers,
   saying,

   O come, let us worship .... thrice.

   Psalm 103 (104). Glory. Both now.

   AT THE LITURGY ETC. I67

   Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God, thrice.

   Then followeth the Ectenia of Peace. Vide page 2.

   After the Exclamation, the Reader be-ginneth to read the 18 th. Kathism
   of the Psalter, after each division of which is said the Little
   Ectenia, the first time with the Exclamation, For thine is the might,
   and thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, of the Father ....
   And the second time, For thou art a good and man-loving God, and to
   thee we ascribe glory, to the Father .... And the third time, For thou
   art our God, the God of mercy and salvation, and to thee we ascribe
   glory, to the Father ....

   Choir. Amen. And beginneth the Lord, I have cried, with the properly
   appointed Stichera.

   Then is sung the Tranquil Light.

   And the proper Prokimena and Lections follow, as are indicated in the
   Triodion.

   [In the lack of this book, the following Stichera, Prokimena and
   Lections may be said.

   Stichera in Tone I. RETHREN, let us keep a spiritual fast,

   let us not speak falsely with our lips, nor put a stumbling-block in
   the way

   of our brother, but with repentance let us brighten the lamp of our
   souls, crying unto Christ, Forgive us our iniquities, O Lover of
   mankind.

   R

   ENOWNED Martyrs, earth retained you not, but heaven hath received you.
   The gates of Paradise were opened unto you, and, dwelling there, ye
   enjoy the tree of life. Pray unto Christ that he may grant peace and
   great mercy to our souls.

   L

   ET us desire a fasting of the soul to extinguish, by the Spirit's aid,
   our dangerous passions, to strengthen us to practise godly deeds, to
   lift our minds to heaven, and to gain us pardon for our sins from God
   most merciful.

   L

   ORD, I have spent my life with sinners shamefully, but like the
   prodigal, myself a prodigal, in penitence I cry, O heavenly Father, I
   have sinned, be gracious unto me, save and reject me not, though I am
   now far from thee and poor in godly works.

   Others in Tone 4.

   T

   O me, choked with life's passions and far from thee, O God the King of
   all things, and altogether hopeless, grant repentance and deliverance
   from evil, and amendment of life, and save me, a prodigal,

   OF THE PRE-SANCTIFIED. I69

   in the greatness of thy goodness, O Jesus almighty, the Saviour of our
   souls.

   T

   HE divine Moses through fasting acquired purity of desire. Then imitate
   him, my poor soul, and hasten while it is day to cleanse thyself from
   evil through continence, that thou mayest find the Lord, who is good
   and man-loving, and granteth thee forgiveness, and graciousness, and
   redemption.

   Glory. Both now.

   And the proper Verse to the Virgin.

   Prokimenon. Tone 4.

   I

   HAVE trusted in the mercy of God for

   ever. Verse. Why boastest thou thyself, O tyrant, that thou canst do
   mischief?

   The Lection from Genesis. Chap. VII. 6'ÃÃ®9.

   ND Noe was six hundred years old when the flood of water was upon the
   earth. And Noe went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him, into the ark, because of the water of the flood. And of clean
   fowls, and of fowls that are not clean, and of clean cattle, and of
   cattle that are not clean, and of beasts, and of every kind of reptile
   that creepeth upon the earth, there went in two and two

   commanded him.

   Prokimenon. Tone 4.

   W

   HEN the Lord turned back the captivity of his people, then did Jacob
   rejoice, and Israel was glad. Verse. The foolish body hath said in his
   heart, There is no God.

   The Lection from Proverbs. Chap. IX. 12'ÃÃ®19.

   Y son, if thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thine own self, but if
   thou turnest out evil, thou alone shalt bear the evil. He that
   receiveth instruction is wise, but to the froward becometh the place of
   a servant. He that resteth upon lies tendeth the wind, yea, he pursueth
   a winged bird. For he quitteth the paths of his own vineyard, and
   roameth in the confines of his own husbandry. He goeth in a way void of
   water, and through a land given up unto thirst, and he gathereth
   fruit-lessness with his hands. A woman that is foolish and bold
   becometh scanty of bread, or otherwise she knoweth not shame. She
   sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat that is open to the
   streets, and calleth to them that pass by, to them that go right on
   their ways, Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither unto me. And to
   them that lack

   OF THE PRE-SANCTIFIED. I7I

   understanding she calleth and saith, Taste ye the secret bread of
   pleasure, and drink ye the sweet stolen water. But he knoweth not that
   the children of earth perish by her, and that he will encounter the
   snares of hades. But turn thou from her, loiter not near her place,
   neither cast thine eyes upon her. For by so doing thou wouldest come
   unto strange water; but from strange water refrain thyself, neither
   drink thou out of strange fountains, that thou mayest live long time,
   and that years of life may be added unto thee.]

   And after the First Lection the Priest exclaimeth,

   Wisdom! Stand up! The Light of Christ appeareth unto all.

   At the conclusion of the Lections, the Reader, or other appointed
   person, standing in the middle of the Church, singeth,

   ET my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, the lifting up of my
   hands as the evening sacrifice.

   During the singing of this verse the Choir on both sides and all the
   People kneel. When the Reader hath sung it, he kneeleth, and the Choir
   and People on the right stand up and repeat the same. And, having done

   I72

   AT THE LITURGY

   so, they kneel again, and the Reader standeth up, and singeth,

   L

   ORD, I have cried unto thee, hear me:

   attend to the voice of my prayer when I cry unto thee.

   Then he kneeleth, and the Choir and People on the left stand up, and
   sing,

   Let my prayer be set forth . . . .

   And they kneel again, and the Reader standeth up, and singeth,

   S

   ET a watch, O Lord, before my mouth,

   and keep the door of my lips.

   And again he kneeleth, and the Choir and People on the right stand up,
   and sing,

   Let my prayer be set forth . . . .

   And again they kneel, and again the Reader standeth, and singeth,

   I

   NCLINE not my heart to evil words to

   make excuses for sins.

   And yet again he kneeleth, while the Choir and People on the left stand
   up, and sing,

   Let my prayer be set forth . . . .

   And they kneel once more, and the Reader standeth up, and singeth,

   OF THE PRE-SANCTIFIED. I73

   L

   ET my prayer be set forth before thee

   as incense.

   And he goeth to his place, while all stand, and both Choirs loudly
   sing,

   T

   HE lifting up of my hands as the evening

   sacrifice.

   Then followeth the Prayer of S. Ephrem with the Genuflections.

   In Holy Passion Week here is read the Gospel, or, if a Festival, they
   read the Epistle and Gospel thereof

   Then the Great Ectenia.

   Let us all say with our whole soul .... Vide page I0.

   After the Exclamation concluding this, followeth the Ectenia for the
   Catechumens. Vide page I48.

   [Now from the Wednesday of Mid-Lent, the following Ectenia is added in
   this place, after the Exclamation, That they also, together with us
   ....

   As many as are Catechumens, depart. Ye Catechumens, depart. As many as
   are about to be illuminated, depart. Pray, ye that are about to be
   illuminated. Let us pray to the Lord. Choir. Lord, have mercy. And so
   after the succeeding petitions.

   I74 AT THE LITURGY

   Ye Faithful, for our brethren that are preparing for holy illumination,
   and for their salvation, let us pray to the Lord.

   That the Lord our God may confirm and strengthen them, let us pray to
   the Lord.

   That he may enlighten them with the light of knowledge and piety, let
   us pray to the Lord.

   That he may grant unto them in due time the laver of regeneration, the
   forgiveness of sins, and the garment of incorruption, let us pray to
   the Lord.

   That he may make them born again of water and of the Spirit, let us
   pray to the Lord.

   That he may bestow upon them the perfection of faith, let us pray to
   the Lord.

   That he may number them among his holy and elect flock, let us pray to
   the Lord.

   Save them, have mercy on them, help them, and keep them, O God, by thy
   grace.

   Ye that are about to be illuminated, bow your heads to the Lord.

   Choir. To thee, O Lord. Exclamation.

   Priest. For thou art our illumination, and to thee we ascribe glory, to
   the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to
   ages of ages.

   OF THE PRE-SANCTIFIED. I75

   Choir. Amen.

   Deacon. As many as are about to be illuminated, depart. Ye that are
   about to be illuminated, depart. As many as are Catechumens, depart.
   Let there be no Catechumens.]

   As many as are Faithful, again and again in peace, let us pray to the
   Lord.

   And the Ectenia of the Faithful, as in the Liturgies of S. Chrysostom
   and S. Basil. The second Exclamation however is, Through the grace of
   thy Christ, with whom thou art blessed, together with thy most holy,
   and good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen. And continueth,

   OW the heavenly Powers invisibly minister with us; for, behold, the
   King of glory is borne in. Behold, the mystic Sacrifice, having been
   perfected, is borne aloft by Angels.

   Let us draw near with faith and love, that we may become partakers of
   life eternal. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

   Deacon. Let us accomplish our evening prayer to the Lord.

   For the precious and pre-sanctified Gifts that are offered, let us pray
   to the Lord.

   That our man-loving God, who hath re-

   157, concluding with the Our Father. Exclamation. For thine is the
   kingdom, and the power, and the glory, of the Father, and of the Son,

   Priest. Peace to all.

   Choir. And to thy spirit.

   Deacon. Let us bow our heads to the Lord.

   Choir. To thee, O Lord. Exclamation.

   Priest. Through the grace, compassion, and love to men of thine
   only-begotten Son, with whom, together with thy most holy, and good,
   and life-creating Spirit, thou art blessed, now and ever, and to ages
   of ages.

   Choir. Amen. Deacon. Let us attend.

   be in my mouth.

   Come, taste the Bread of heaven, and the Cup of salvation, and see that
   the Lord is good. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

   Sacrament.]

   Priest. O God, save thy people, and bless thine inheritance.

   Always, now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen. Let our mouth be filled . . . .

   And the rest, as in the Liturgies of Saints Chrysostom and Basil,
   saving only that they shall say this whole evening instead of this
   whole day in the Ectenia, that the Priest shall substitute for the
   prayer beginning, Lord, who blessest them .... the following,

   LMIGHTY Lord, who in wisdom madest all things, who, after thine
   unspeakable foreknowledge and great goodness, dost sanctify unto us
   these sacred days for the cleansing of our souls and bodies, for the
   subduing of our passions, and for the hope of resurrection, and who
   after forty days didst give unto thy servant Moses the divinely written
   tables of the law; grant thou unto us, O Blessed One, that we may fight
   the good fight, may finish the course of the fast, may keep perfectly
   the faith,

   I78 AT THE LITURGY ETC.

   may crush the heads of the invisible serpents, may become victorious
   over sin, and without condemnation may attain unto the time to worship
   thy holy Resurrection. For blessed and glorified is thine
   all-honourable and majestic name, of the Father, and of the Son, and of
   the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   And that the Dismissal shall be on this wise,

   [In Holy Passion Week, He that for our salvation willingly endured
   passion,] Christ our true God, through the prayers of his all-pure
   Mother, through the might of his precious and life-giving Cross,
   through the prayers of our holy Father, Gregory the Divine, and of all
   the Saints, have mercy upon us and save us; for he is good and the
   Lover of men.

   XVII. SUNDAY SERVICE IN THE SIXTH TONE.

   AT THE GREAT VESPERS.

   With the Lord, I have cried, Stichera on the Resurrection in Tone 6.

   HOU didst ascend the Cross, O Christ, to win victory over hades, that,
   together with thyself, thou mightest raise them that sat in the shades
   of death. O almighty Saviour, thou that art the Redeemer of the dead,
   from whose light springeth life, have mercy upon us.

   Verse. If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark transgression, O Lord, who
   should stand? But with thee there is propitiation.

   T

   O-DAY Christ treadeth down death, as

   he said. He is risen and giveth joy

   unto the world. Therefore in hymns we

   cry, O almighty Saviour, who art the Foun-

   I80 SUNDAY SERVICE

   tain of life and of light inaccessible, have mercy upon us.

   Verse. For thy name'ÃÃ´s sake have I waited for thee, O Lord: my soul
   hath waited for thy word, my soul hath trusted in the Lord.

   O

   LORD, who art everywhere present, whither shall we sinners go to find
   thee? To heaven? there thou dwellest. To hades? there thou didst tread
   down death. Into the depth of the sea? there is thine hand. O Lord, we
   come to thee, and unto thee falling down, we pray, O thou that didst
   rise from the dead, have mercy upon us.

   Verse. From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch let
   Israel trust in the Lord.

   W

   E exult because of thy Cross, O Christ, and sing and glorify thy
   Resurrection; for thou art our God, and besides thee we know none
   other.

   Verse. For with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous
   redemption, and he shall redeem Israel from all his transgressions.

   E

   VER blessing the Lord, we sing his Resurrection; for, enduring
   crucifixion, death by death he overthrew.

   Verse. Praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise him all ye peoples.

   IN THE SIXTH TONE. I8I

   G

   LORY to thy might, O Lord, for thou hast abolished him that had the
   power of death, and hast renewed us by thy Cross, giving us life and
   immortality.

   Verse. For his mercy is confirmed upon us, and the truth of the Lord
   remaineth for ever.

   O

   LORD, thy Burial hath burst the bonds of hades, and thy Resurrection
   from the dead hath enlightened the world. Glory to thee, O Lord.

   W

   Glory. Both now. To the Virgin.

   HO would not bless thee, most pure Virgin? who would not sing thy holy
   child-birth? For he that shone for ever from the Father, even the
   only-begotten Son, came forth from thee unspeakably incarnate. He that
   is by nature God became by nature man for us. He was not divided into
   two persons, but appeared, without confusion, in two natures. Beseech
   him, O most pure and blessed one, to have mercy on our souls.

   Then the Tranquil Light, and the Pro-kimenon. Vide page 8.

   The Stichera with Verses. Tone 6.

   HY Resurrection, O Saviour Christ, Angels sing in heaven. Vouchsafe to
   us also upon earth to extol thee with pure heart.

   I82 SUNDAY SERVICE

   Verse. The Lord is King : he hath put on glorious apparel.

   O

   GOD almighty, thou didst shatter the gates of brass and burst the bonds
   of hades, and thou didst raise the fallen race of men. Therefore with
   one accord we cry, O Lord, who didst rise from the dead, glory to thee.

   Verse. He hath made the whole world so sure that it cannot be moved.

   W

   ILLING to restore our old estate, Christ was nailed to the Cross and
   placed in the grave, and the myrrh-bearing women, seeking him with
   tears, lamenting said, Alas! Saviour of all, how didst thou deign to
   dwell within a grave? And having dwelt there, who hath stolen thee?
   Whither art thou gone? And what place hideth thy quickening Body?
   Appear to us, O Lord, as thou didst say, and stay our wailing tears. As
   thus they wept, an Angel cried to them, Cease now your tears, and tell
   to the Apostles that the Lord is risen, granting propitiation and great
   mercy to the world.

   Verse. Holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever.

   O

   CHRIST, thou hast been crucified, as thou didst will, and by the grave
   hast spoiled death, and on the third day, as God,

   IN THE SIXTH TONE. I83

   hast risen with glory, bestowing life unending and great mercy on the
   world.

   M

   Glory. Both now. To the Virgin.

   Y Maker and Redeemer, Christ the Lord, came forth from thee, most pure
   one, endued like me, and delivered Adam from the ancient curse.
   Therefore the Angel's greeting we exclaim to thee, the all-pure Mother
   of God, the Virgin true, Hail! Lady, mediatress, defender, and
   salvation of our souls.

   Then, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant .... Trisagion. O most holy
   Trinity. And, after Our Father,

   The Troparion in Tone 6.

   NGELIC powers are at thy tomb, and the guards are deadened, and Mary
   standeth at the grave seeking thy most pure Body. Thou madest hades
   captive, not being tempted by it. Thou didst meet the Virgin, and
   grantest life. O risen Lord, glory to thee.

   To the Virgin.

   T

   HOU who didst call thy Mother blessed, of thine own will earnest to
   suffer, and shining on the Cross that thou mightest bring back Adam,
   telledst the Angels, Rejoice with me, for the lost drachma is found.

   I84 SUNDAY SERVICE

   O God, who in wisdom hast made all things, glory to thee.

   AT THE GREAT MATINS.

   After the Six Psalms, The Lord is God, and hath appeared , . . . in
   Tone 6.

   And we say the Troparion.

   Angelic powers are at thy tomb ....

   Glory. Both now.

   Thou who didst call thy Mother .... And the usual Kathisms of the
   Psalter.

   After the First Kathism, Kathismal Hymn in Tone 6.

   HE grave being open and hades lamenting, Mary cried to the hidden
   Apostles, Come forth, ye workers of the vineyard, and proclaim the word
   of the Resurrection, The Lord is risen, granting great mercy to the
   world.

   Glory. Both now. To the Virgin.

   O

   MOTHER of God, Gideon did thy conception pre-narrate, and David told
   thy bringing forth. For as the dew came down upon the fleece, so did
   the Word into thy womb, and without seed thou bearedst fruit, O holy
   land, even the world's salvation, Christ our God, thou that art full of
   grace.

   IN THE SIXTH TONE. I85

   After the Second Kathism, Kathismal Hymn in Tone 6.

   HE Life is placed in a grave, with a seal laid upon the stone. As a
   sleeping king the soldiers guarded Christ, and, invisibly beating down
   his enemies, the Lord arose.

   Glory. Both now. To the Virgin.

   O

   VIRGIN Mother of God, beseech thy

   Son, who of his own will was nailed to the Cross and from the dead
   arose, even Christ our God, to save our souls.

   After the Blessed are they that are un-defiled . . . . i. e., Psalm 118
   (119),

   The Troparia as at page 25. Blessed art thou, O Lord . . . .

   The assembly of Angels . . . .

   After these, the Hypaco?Â´ in Tone 6.

   O

   CHRIST, by thy voluntary and life-

   effecting death, thou didst, as God, overthrow the gates of hades and
   open unto us the ancient paradise, and, risen from the dead, hast saved
   our life from corruption.

   Then the Graduals in Tone 6.

   Antiphon I.

   NTO heaven have I lifted up mine eyes, even unto thee, O Word. Have
   compassion upon me, that I may live to thee.

   I86 SUNDAY SERVICE

   Have mercy upon us who have been set at naught, making us again thy
   serviceable vessels, O Word.

   Glory. Both now.

   In the Holy Spirit is an all-saving fount. On whom he breatheth,
   according to their worth, he quickly raiseth from things of earth, he
   lifteth them, exalteth them, and placeth them on high.

   Antiphon II.

   I

   F the Lord were not with us, we none

   could have withstood the enemy's attacks. For they that overcome are
   thereby exalted.

   Let not my soul as a bird be caught in their teeth, O Word. Alas! how
   shall I be delivered from the enemy, who am myself

   a lover of sin.

   Glory. Both now.

   Through the Holy Spirit cometh inspiration unto all, goodwill,
   understanding, peace and blessing; for he is co-worker with the Father
   and the Word.

   Antiphon III.

   Verse. Hear, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a

   The Lection from the holy Evangelist Matthew. Section 116.

   T that time, the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
   mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they
   worshipped him, but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them,
   saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
   therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe
   all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo! I am with you
   alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

   Refrain. Glory to thy holy Resurrection, O Lord.

   O blessed Jesus, thou didst stretch forth thine hands upon the Cross,
   and so fulfil thy Father'ÃÃ´s will. Therefore we sing a victorious song
   to thee.

   Death, as a bidden servant, approached thee in fear, O Lord of life,
   and thou thereby dost grant us endless life and resurrection.

   Glory.

   At Pilate'ÃÃ´s judgment-seat, unlawfully accused, willed to stand, as

   Ode III. Irmos.

   O

   LORD, my God, there is none holy like to thee, who dost exalt thy
   faithful peoples horn, stablishing us, O Blessed One, upon the rock of
   thy confession.

   Creation saw thee crucified in flesh, O God, and feared; though, by
   thine upholding hand, who wast crucified for us, it is most firmly
   stablished.

   Death, slain by death, lieth condemned and prone; for this strong one
   bore not the divine approach, and died, and resurrection is bestowed on
   all.

   Glory.

   Glory to thine Arising, O our almighty Saviour; for out of death, and
   hades, and corruption thou hast delivered us, and singing unto thee we
   cry, There is none holy like to thee, O Lord, thou Lover of mankind.

   Both now. To the Virgin.

   The wonder of thy divine child-birth, O pure one, surpasseth nature's

   T that time, Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
   day. And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
   eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in nowise lift up
   herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
   her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he laid his hands
   on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. And
   the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that
   Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There
   are six days in which men ought to work, in them therefore come and be
   healed, and not on the sabbath day. The Lord then answered him and
   said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his
   ox or his ass from the stall, and

   deliver me from the torment and from the fire, that I may be saved by
   thee, and may sing thine invincible goodness.

   Ode IX. Irmos.

   HE unspeakable birth from a seedless conception of a husbandless mother
   is an incorruptible fruit; for the birth of God re-generateth nature.
   Then do all generations right-believingly magnify thee as the
   divine-bride Mother.

   The Lord shall come to torment the sinners and to save the righteous.
   Let us weep, let us lament, and let us take thought for that day on
   which every unknown and secret thing shall be revealed, and every man
   be meted after his deserts.

   Daniel feared the hour of trial. What then shall I, accursed one,
   endure when the Lord shall come on the terrible day? Still grant me
   before the end to serve thee acceptably, and to attain unto thy
   kingdom. Glory.

   The fire is ready, the worm is prepared. Gladness, glory, rest, light

   torment of the one, and to gain the inheritance of the other?

   LORD, when the thrones shall be set and the books be opened, and thou,

   kingdom, O Saviour.

   bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
   long-suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if
   any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also
   do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of

   Verse. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit

   heavenly, terrible and holy Mysteries, and of thy divine and mystical
   Supper, O God, my Saviour.

   Seeking refuge in thy loving-kindness, O Blessed One, I cry to thee
   with fear, Abide in me, O Saviour, and let me also, as thou didst say,
   abide in thee; for, lo! trusting in

   incorruptible ?

   Ode IX. Irmos.

   T

   HE Son of the unbeginning Father, the God and Lord incarnate of the
   Virgin, hath appeared to us, to enlighten the darkened and to gather

   ON THE MORROW, THE USUAL OFFICE OF HOURS.

   And after the Beatitudes,

   The Lection from the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians.
   Section 149.

   RETHREN! I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
   you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
   bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat,
   this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
   After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,
   This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye
   drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and
   drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord'ÃÃ´s death till he come. Wherefore
   whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord
   unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let
   a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the
   cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
   condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord'ÃÃ´s body. For this
   cause many are weak and sickly among you, and

   230 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
   But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should
   not be condemned with the world.

   The Lection from the holy Evangelist John. Section 23.

   HE Lord said unto them that came unto him of the Jews, I am the bread
   of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
   This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat
   thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven
   : if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, and the bread
   that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
   world. The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this
   man give us his flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto them, Amen, Amen, I
   say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
   blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
   blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

   Through the prayers of our holy Fathers. . . .

   O heavenly King .... Trisagion. After the Our Father, Lord, have mercy,
   twelve times. Glory. Both now. O come, let us worship .... thrice. And
   the following Psalms.

   Psalm 22 (23).

   HE Lord is my Shepherd, therefore can I lack nothing. He shall feed me
   in a green pasture, and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort. He
   shall convert my soul, and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness
   for his name'ÃÃ´s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
   shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me, thy rod and
   thy staff comfort me. Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them
   that trouble me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and thy cup
   inebriateth me as with strong wine. And thy mercy shall follow me all
   the days of my life, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord for
   ever.

   Psalm 23 (24).

   HE earth is the Lord'ÃÃ´s, and all that therein is, the compass of the
   world and they that dwell therein. For he hath founded it upon the
   seas, and prepared

   232 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who
   shall rise up in his holy place? Even he that hath clean hands and a
   pure heart, that hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to
   deceive his neighbour. He shall receive blessing from the Lord, and
   righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of
   them that seek him, even of them that seek thy face, O God of Jacob.
   Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
   gates, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory?
   It is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty in battle. Lift
   up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting gates,
   and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? Even
   the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

   Psalm 115 (116).

   BELIEVED, and therefore have I spoken, but I was sore troubled. I said
   in my haste, All men are liars. What reward shall I render unto the
   Lord for all the benefits he hath done unto me? I will take the cup of
   salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows now
   in the presence of all his

   people. Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
   Behold, Lord, how that I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid:
   thou hast broken my bonds in sunder. I will offer to thee the sacrifice
   of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my
   vows unto the Lord in the sight of all his people, in the courts of the
   Lord'ÃÃ´s house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.

   the worthy, I venture to approach thee, my garment will

   Prayer of Saint Basil the Great.

   Lord Jesus Christ our God, Source of life and immortality, Creator of
   all things visible and invisible, co-eternal Son with the everlasting
   Father, who, out of thy great loving-kindness, didst in the latter days
   become incarnate, and wast crucified for us ungrateful and thankless
   ones, and hast renewed with thine own Blood our nature corrupted by
   sin; do thou thyself, immortal King, accept the repentance of thy
   sinful servant, incline thine ear towards me, and hearken unto my
   supplications. For I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned against heaven
   and against thee, and I am not worthy to raise mine eyes to the height
   of thy glory; I have also angered thy goodness by transgressing thy
   commandments and by not obeying thine ordinances. But thou, O Lord, who
   art long-suffering and of great mercy, hast not given me over to perish
   in my sins, always awaiting my conversion. For thou hast said by thy
   Prophets, O thou Lover of mankind, that thou hast not pleasure in the
   death of a sinner, but rather

   236 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   that he should return and live. Thou willest not, O Lord, that the
   works of thy hands should be lost, neither hast thou pleasure in the
   perdition of men, but desirest that all should be saved and come to the
   knowledge of the truth. Therefore even I, although unworthy of heaven,
   or yet of earth and of this temporal life, having submitted my whole
   self to sin and made myself a slave of pleasure, defiling thine image,
   being still thy creature and thy handiwork, despair not of salvation,
   reprobate as I am; and, emboldened by thine immeasurable compassion, I
   come unto thee. Receive me then, even me, O man-loving Lord, like the
   adulteress, like the thief, like the publican, like the prodigal, and
   take away the heavy load of my sins, O thou who takest away the sins of
   the world, who healest the infirmities of men, who callest unto thyself
   the weary and the burdened and givest them rest, who earnest not to
   call the righteous but sinners to repentance. And do thou cleanse me
   from every defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, and teach me to
   perfect holiness in the fear of thee, that, in the pure testimony of my
   conscience, receiving my portion of thy holy things, I may be united
   with thy holy Body and Blood, and have thee to dwell and to remain
   within me, with the Father

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 237

   and thy Holy Spirit. Yea, O Lord Jesus Christ my God, grant that the
   communion of thy holy and life-giving Mysteries may not be to my
   condemnation, neither let me communicate of them unworthily on account
   of the ailings of my soul and body; but grant me unto the last breath
   of my life to partake uncondemned of my share of thy holy things, to
   the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, as a provision for life eternal, and
   for a favourable answer at thy terrible judgment-seat; that I, even I,
   may also become with thine elect a partaker of thine incorruptible
   blessings, which thou hast prepared for them that love thee, O Lord, in
   whom thou art glorified td'ÃÃ´ ages. Amen.

   Prayer of our Father in the Saints, John Chrysostom.

   KNOW, O Lord my God, that I am not worthy nor sufficient that thou
   shouldest come under the roof of my soul'ÃÃ´s habitation, for it is all
   deserted and in ruins, and thou hast not in me where worthily to lay
   thy head. But as from the height of thy glory thou didst humble thyself
   for us, bear now also with my humility; and as thou didst deign to lay
   thyself down in a manger in a cave, so deign now also to enter into the
   manger of my mute soul

   and defiled body; and as thou didst not refuse to enter into the house
   of Simon the leper and to sup there with sinners, so also deign to
   enter into the habitation of my humble soul, leprous and sinful; and as
   thou didst not reject the sinful woman who approached and touched thee,
   so also have pity on me, a sinner, coming to thee and touching thee.
   And grant that I may partake of thy precious Body and thine honourable
   Blood to the sanctification, enlightenment and strengthening of my
   humble soul and body, to the alleviation of the burden of my many sins,
   to my preservation from all the snares of the devil, to victory over my
   sinful and evil habits, to the mortification of my passions, to the
   fulfilment of thy commandments, to the increase of thy divine grace,
   and to the inheritance of thy kingdom. For it is not in lightness of
   heart, O Christ my God, that I venture to approach thee, but trusting
   in thine infinite goodness, and in the fear that being drawn afar from
   thee I may become the prey of our spiritual enemy. Therefore do I pray
   unto thee, O Lord, who alone art holy, that thou wouldest sanctify my
   soul and body, my heart and mind, and, renewing me entirely, wouldest
   implant in my members the fear of thee. And be thou my Help and Guide,

   thee. Amen.

   Prayer of Saint Simeon the Meditative.

   ONLY pure and all-holy Lord, who, through immeasurable compassion for
   man, didst take upon thyself the whole burden of our mortality in thy
   miraculous conception by the operation of the Holy Spirit and by the
   good will of the eternal Father; thyself, O Jesus Christ, the Wisdom,
   the Peace, and the Power of God, who didst deign to take upon thyself
   thy life-giving and saving passion, the cross, the nails, the spear and
   death itself; deaden, I beseech thee, my bodily passions which destroy
   my soul. O thou who by thy burial didst vanquish the kingdom of hell,
   bury my evil imaginations in good thoughts, and disperse within me the
   spirits of evil. O thou who in thy life-giving resurrection on the
   third day didst raise again our fallen forefather Adam, raise me who am
   dead in sin, and give me the means of repentance. O thou who didst in
   thy glorious ascension

   deify the flesh that thou hadst taken upon thee, and didst honour it by
   a seat at the right hand of God, enable me by partaking of thy holy
   Sacrament to obtain a place on thy right hand with thy redeemed. O thou
   who by the descent of the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, didst render thy,
   holy disciples worthy vessels, do thou render me also a receptacle for
   his habitation. O thou who shalt come again to judge the world, bless
   me also to meet thee, my Creator and Judge, in the clouds with all thy
   Saints, that I may for ever praise and glorify thee, with thine eternal
   Father, and thy most holy, and good, and life-giving Spirit, now and
   ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   Another Prayer of the same Saint.

   CHRIST my God, as though I were standing before thy terrible and
   impartial judgment-seat, awaiting my sentence and rendering an account
   of mine evil deeds, so, even at this present hour before the day of my
   judgment has yet come, I stand before thy holy Altar, before thy
   terrible and holy Angels, and, bowed down by my conscience, I bring
   before thee my evil and wicked doings, and confess them, and reveal
   them. O Lord, look down on my humility, and forgive all my sins. See,

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 24I

   my transgressions number more than the hairs of my head. What evil have
   I not done? What sin have I not committed? What wickedness have I not
   imagined in my soul? Have I not sinned indeed by pride, boasting,
   slander, idle speech, improper laughter, intemperance, hatred, envy,
   avarice, self-love, ambition, falsehood? Have I not defiled all my
   senses, all my members, and have I not been a ready agent of Satan? I
   know well, O Lord, that mine iniquities have gone over my head ; but I
   also know that the multitude of thy bounties is without measure, and
   the mercy of thy great goodness is unspeakable, and there is no sin
   that can overcome thy loving - kindness. Therefore, O most wonderful
   King, O most good Lord, do thou shew thy mercies in me, a sinner,
   manifest in me the power of thy goodness and the might of thy
   loving-kindness, and receive me who turn to thee. Accept me as thou
   didst accept the prodigal, the thief, and the sinful woman. Accept me,
   though in word and in deed, by my evil passions and unreasonable
   imaginations, I have sinned without measure against thee. And as at the
   eleventh hour thou didst receive them that came unto thee, though
   nothing worthy had they done, so also receive me, a sinner; for greatly
   have I sinned,

   16

   242 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   and am defiled, and I have grieved thy Holy Spirit, and offended thy
   loving-kindness in word, in deed, and in thought, by night and by day,
   openly and secretly, knowingly and unknowingly; and full well I know
   that thou wilt shew unto me my sins such as I have committed them, and
   that thou wilt demand an account from me of that wherein I have
   offended without excuse. But, O Lord, O Lord, rebuke me not in thy
   righteous wrath, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Have mercy
   upon me, O Lord, for though I am weak, I am also thy creature. Thou, O
   Lord, hast stablished thy fear in me, and

   yet I have done evil in thy sight. Against

   thee, thee only, have I sinned, but, I beseech

   thee, enter not into jugdment with thy ser-

   vant. For if, O Lord, thou wilt be extreme

   to mark what is done amiss, O Lord, who

   shall abide before thee ? I shall not, for I

   am but an abyss of evil, and am neither

   worthy nor sufficient to look up and behold

   the height of heaven on account of the

   multitude of my sins. For what sins have I not committed? What evil
   hath not pos-

   sessed me ? Every sin have I committed,

   every uncleanness have I taken into my

   soul, and I have been unprofitable before

   thee and before men. Oh! who will raise me fallen into such great and
   dire sins ?

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 243

   O Lord my God, I have put my trust in

   thee. If there is any hope of salvation for

   me, if thy loving mercy can overcome the

   multitude of my transgressions, be thou my

   Saviour, and, according to thy goodness and mercy, loosen, remit and
   forgive all wherein I have sinned; for my soul is full of trouble, and
   there is no hope of salvation in me. Have mercy upon me, O God,
   according to thy loving-kindness; deal not with me accord- ing to my
   sins; but turn, preserve, and de-liver my soul from the evils besetting
   it, and from all its wicked undertakings. Save me for thy mercy'ÃÃ´s
   sake, that where sin abounded thy grace may much more abound ; and I
   will glorify thee always, all the days of my life. For thou art the God
   of the penitent, and the Saviour of sinners, and to thee we ascribe
   glory, with thine eternal Father, and thy most holy, and good, and
   life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   Prayer of the Divine Damascene.

   LORD Jesus Christ our God, who alone hast power to remit the sins of
   men ; do thou, O most Good and most Merciful One, remit the sins that I
   have committed wilfully, or in ignorance, and enable me, uncondemned,
   to receive thy

   244 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   divine, glorious, most pure and life-giving Mysteries, not to judgment,
   not to punishment, not to increase of sin, but to purification and
   sanctification, to a closer communion with the kingdom and the life to
   come, as a bulwark and a help to my soul, to the turning away from
   evil, and to the blotting out of my many sins. For thou art the God of
   mercy and bounties, and thou lovest mankind; and to thee we ascribe
   glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to ages
   of ages. Amen.

   Prayer of Saint Basil the Great.

   KNOW, O Lord, that I receive un- worthily thy most pure Body and thy
   precious Blood, that I am guilty, O Lord, and that I eat and drink to
   my own condemnation, not discerning the Body and Blood of Christ my
   God; but, trusting in thy mercy, I come unto thee who hast said, He
   that eateth my Flesh and drinketh my Blood shall abide in me and I in
   him. Have compassion upon me therefore, O Lord, and make not an example
   of me, thy sinful servant; but do with me according to thy great mercy,
   and grant that these holy things may rather operate in me to the
   healing, purifying, enlightening, guarding, saving and sanctifying of
   my soul and body,

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 245

   to the overthrow of every imagination, evil action, or work of the
   devil, to loving and acknowledging thee, to the amendment and
   steadfastness of my life, to the increase of virtue, to the keeping of
   thy commandments, to the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, to the hope of
   eternal life, and to be an acceptable apology before thine awful
   judgment seat. Amen.

   Prayer of Saint Simeon the New Divine.

   ROM soiled lips,

   From fouled heart,

   From tongue impure,

   From soul defiled,

   Accept a prayer, my Christ,

   And of me despise,

   Neither the words, neither the manner, Nor the shamelessness.

   Grant me daringly to say

   That which I wish, my Christ,

   Or rather, teach thou me

   What me behoveth to do and say.

   I have sinned more than that sinful woman,

   Who, learning where thou wast,

   Did purchase myrrh,

   And came daringly to anoint

   The feet of thee, my Christ,

   My Master, and my God.

   Since thou didst not reject her,

   246 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   Coming with her heart to thee,

   So loathe not me, O Word of God;

   But give me thy feet

   To touch and kiss,

   And with a flood of tears,

   As with most precious myrrh,

   To daringly anoint.

   Wash me in my tears,

   And with them cleanse me, Word of God;

   And forgive mine iniquities,

   And grant me pardon.

   Thou knowest the multitude of evils in me,

   Thou knowest my wounds,

   And seest my sores;

   But thou knowest also my faith,

   Thou seest my good intentions,

   And hearest my sighs.

   There is nothing hidden from thee, O my God,

   My Creator, my Redeemer,

   Not even a tear-drop,

   Nor a part of that drop.

   My substance yet imperfect

   Thine eyes did behold,

   And in thy book

   Even things not yet done

   Are found written by thee.

   Look upon my lowliness,

   Look upon my grief how great it is,

   And all my sins

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 247

   Forgive me, God of all things,

   That, with pure heart,

   And fearing mind,

   And contrite soul,

   I may partake of thy spotless

   And most pure Mysteries,

   Which quicken and deify

   All them that eat and drink

   In purity of heart.

   For thou, my Lord, hast said,

   He that eateth my Flesh

   And drinketh my Blood

   In me shall he abide,

   And I abide in him.

   True is every word

   Of my Master and my God.

   For, partaking of thy divine

   And deifying blessings,

   I am no more alone,

   But with thee, O my Christ,

   The tri-solar light

   Which enlighteneth the world.

   Let me not then remain alone

   Without thee, O Life-giver,

   My breath, my life,

   My gladness,

   And the salvation of the world.

   For this cause have I come to thee,

   As thou seest, with tears

   And contrite soul,

   248 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   Deliverance from mine iniquities

   Praying to be granted me,

   And of thy life-giving

   And perfect Mysteries

   To partake uncondemned;

   So that thou mayest abide, as thou hast said,

   With me, a thrice-accursed one,

   Lest, finding me separated

   From thy grace, the tempter

   Should beguile me,

   And, being tempted, draw me

   From thy divine-effecting words.

   For this cause I fall down to thee,

   And earnestly I cry to thee,

   As thou didst receive the prodigal,

   And the sinful woman who came to thee,

   So receive me, a sinner,

   And a prodigal, O Compassionate One,

   Who, with smitten soul,

   Now come to thee.

   I know, O Saviour, that no one

   Hath sinned so as I have,

   Nor done such deeds

   As I have wrought;

   But this I also know

   That not the greatness of iniquity,

   Nor the multitude of sins,

   Surpasseth of my God

   The abundant long-suffering

   And exceeding love to men;

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 249

   But that, in merciful compassion,

   Them that earnestly repent

   Thou cleansest and enlightenest,

   And makest partakers of light,

   And communicants of thy Divinity,

   Making no distinctions,

   And, strange thing to Angels

   And to the thoughts of men!

   Conversest with them ofttimes,

   As with thy true friends.

   This it is that emboldeneth me,

   This it is that inspireth me, O my Christ;

   And, trusting in the riches

   Of thy benefactions unto us,

   Joyful and yet trembling,

   I partake of fire,

   Myself but grass, and, strange the wonder!

   Am unconsumedly bedewed,

   As of old the bush

   Did burn unconsumedly.

   And now, with thankful mind,

   With thankful heart,

   A.nd with thankful songs

   Of my soul and body,

   I worship, and magnify,

   And glorify thee, O my God ;

   For thou art blessed

   Now and for ever.

   Prayer of Saint John Chrysostom.

   GOD, loosen, remit and forgive my sins against thee, whether in word,
   in deed, or in thought, willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or
   unknowingly committed, forgive them all; for thou art good and lovest
   mankind. And, through the prayers of thy most holy Mother, of thy
   heavenly Servants and holy Powers, and of all the Saints who have found
   favour in thy sight, bless me to receive uncondemned thy holy and
   immaculate Body and thy precious Blood, to the healing of my soul and
   body, and to the driving away of my evil imaginations ; for thine is
   the kingdom, the power, and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now
   and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   Another of Saint Chrysostom.

   LORD and God, I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter the habitation
   of my soul; but as thou willest, according to thy loving-kindness, to
   dwell in me, I venture to approach thee. Thou biddest me open the gates
   of my soul, which thou alone hast made, that thou mayest enter therein
   with thy wonted loving-kindness, that thou mayest enter and enlighten
   my darkened mind. I believe thou wilt do

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 251

   this, for thou didst not cast away the sinful woman coming to thee in
   tears, nor didst thou reject the penitent publican, nor the thief on
   the cross who acknowledged thy kingdom, nor didst thou leave the
   repentant persecutor to himself, but didst number all them that came to
   thee in repentance among thy friends, O thou that alone art blessed,
   always, now, and to everlasting ages. Amen.

   Another Prayer of Saint Chrysostom.

   LORD Jesus Christ my God, loosen, remit, cleanse and forgive me, thine
   unworthy and miserable servant, all my sins, iniquities, and errors, as
   often as I have sinned against thee from my youth up to the present day
   and hour, whether wittingly or in ignorance, whether in word or deed,
   in thought or imagination, or in all my feelings. And, through the
   prayers of thy pure Mother, the blessed ever-virgin Mary, my alone sure
   hope and protection, enable me without condemnation to partake of thy
   holy, immortal, life-giving, and terrible Mysteries, unto the remission
   of sins and life everlasting, unto the sanctification, enlightenment,
   strength and health of my soul and body, to the complete overthrow and
   destruction of my evil thoughts, prejudices and imaginations; for thine
   is the kingdom,

   and thy Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

   Prayer of Saint John Damascene.

   STAND before the gates of thy temple, and yet do my grievous thoughts
   not leave me. But thou, O Christ my God, who didst justify the
   publican, didst have mercy upon the Canaanite, and didst open the gates
   of paradise to the thief on the cross; open unto me thy bowels of
   compassionate mercy, and receive me coming unto thee and touching thee
   like the sinful woman and like the sick woman; for she touched but the
   hem of thy garment, and was healed, and the other embracing thy feet
   received forgiveness of her sins. But I, a miserable sinner, that dare
   to partake of thy precious Body, let me not be consumed ; but receive
   me like unto them, and enlighten my spiritual senses, destroying my
   sinful errors, through the prayers of thy holy Mother and of the
   heavenly Hosts; for blessed art thou to ages of ages. Amen.

   Prayer of Saint John Chrysostom.

   BELIEVE, O Lord, and confess that thou art verily Christ, the Son of
   the living God, who didst come into the

   PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION. 253

   world to save sinners, of whom I am the greatest. And I believe that
   this is thy most pure Body, and this thy most precious Blood. I
   therefore pray thee, Have mercy upon me, and forgive me my sins,
   voluntary and involuntary, in word and in deed, in knowledge or in
   ignorance committed; and vouchsafe me, uncondemned, to partake of thy
   most pure Mysteries, to the remission of sins, and to life eternal.

   On approaching to communicate, say the following lines of Saint Simeon.

   EHOLD I approach the divine Communion !

   My Creator, consume me not in the partaking of it;

   For thou art a consuming fire to the unworthy :

   Purify me now from every stain.

   Then say,

   F thy mysterious Supper to-day, O Son of God, accept me as a partaker;
   for I will not reveal thy Mystery to thine enemies, nor give thee a
   kiss as Judas, but as the thief I will confess thee, Remember me, O
   Lord, in thy kingdom.

   And again these lines:

   O

   MAN, behold the divine Blood, and

   tremble;

   254 PRAYERS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

   For it is a fire consuming the unworthy.

   The divine Body both deifieth and nour-isheth;

   It deifieth the spirit, and strangely nour-isheth the mind.

   Also the Troparia.

   T

   HOU hast sweetened me, O Christ, by thy love, and hast changed me by
   thy divine favour. Consume my sins with thy spiritual fire, and enable
   me to be so filled with the love of thee, that, leaping for joy, I may
   magnify thy presence, O Blessed One.

   Into the brilliant company of thy Saints how shall I, unworthy and
   sinful, enter? If I dare to enter into the bridechamber, my garment
   will put me to shame, for it is not a wedding one, and I shall be bound
   hand and foot and cast out by thine Angels. Purify, Lord, my polluted
   soul, and save me in thy loving-kindness.

   Prayer.

   Prayer of Saint Simeon the Meditative, in Verses.

   THOU who, of thine own good will, dost give thy Body as food unto me,

   Thou who art a fire consuming the unworthy;

   Consume me not, O my Creator,

   But rather enter into my limbs, my joints, my inmost heart,

   And burn the tares of my transgressions.

   Cleanse thou my soul, and sanctify my thoughts.

   Strengthen my limbs, together with my bones.

   Enlighten my five senses. Stablish me wholly in thy fear.

   Ever cover me; preserve and protect me from all soul - corrupting words
   and deeds.

   Make me chaste, purify and wash me; garnish me, instruct and enlighten
   me.

   Shew me to be the habitation of thy one Spirit, and in nowise the
   dwelling - place of sin;

   That from me, thy dwelling through the reception of thy Sacrament, all
   evil, every lust may flee as from fire.

   I invoke as supplicants for me all the

   HE Lord said unto his disciples, Now is the Son of man glorified, and
   God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God shall also
   glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. Little
   children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and as I
   said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
   A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have
   loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know
   that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. Simon Peter
   said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I
   go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
   Peter

   278 EXTRACTS FROM THE LENTEN TRIODION.

   said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my
   life for thy sake. Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for
   my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till
   thou hast denied me thrice. Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe
   in God, believe also in me. In my Father'ÃÃ´s house are many mansions:
   if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for
   you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
   receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And
   whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord,
   we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus
   saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh
   unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my
   Father also; and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip
   saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus
   saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou
   not known me, Philip ? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and
   how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Be-lievest thou not that I am
   in the Father, and the Father in me ? The words that I speak

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 279

   unto you I speak not of myself; but the Father that dwelleth in me, he
   doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in
   me; or else believe me for the very works'ÃÃ´ sake. Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do
   also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my
   Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that
   the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in my
   name, I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will
   pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may
   abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world
   cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye
   know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not
   leave you comfortless: I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the
   world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live
   also. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me,
   and I in you. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is
   that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and
   I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Judas saith unto

   28O EXTRACTS FROM THE LENTEN TRIOD1ON.

   him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto
   us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man
   love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we
   will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not
   keepeth not my sayings; and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the
   Father'ÃÃ´s which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you, being
   yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
   the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and
   bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
   Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
   giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
   be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
   unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto
   the Father; for my Father is greater than I. And now I have told you
   before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might
   believe. Hereafter I will not talk much with you; for the prince of
   this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. But that the world may know
   that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so
   I

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 28I

   do. Arise, let us go hence. I am the true vine, and my Father is the
   husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away;
   and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring
   forth more fruit. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken
   unto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
   itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in
   me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in
   him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do
   nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
   withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
   are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
   what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father
   glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As
   the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
   If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have
   kept my Father'ÃÃ´s commandments, and abide in his love. These things
   have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your
   joy might be full. This is my commandment, That ye love

   282 EXTRACTS FROM THE LENTEN TRIODION.

   one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this,
   that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye
   do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants, for
   the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you
   friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made
   known unto you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and
   ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your
   fruit should remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my
   name, he may give it you. These things I command you, that ye love one
   another. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it
   hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love his own; but
   because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
   world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said
   unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have
   persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my
   saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do
   unto you for my name'ÃÃ´s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
   If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now
   they have no cloke for their sin. He that hateth

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 283

   me hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which
   none other man did, they had not had sin; but now have they both seen
   and hated both me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word
   might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without
   a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
   the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,
   he shall testify of me; and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have
   been with me from the beginning. These things have I spoken unto you,
   that ye should not be offended. They shall put you out of the
   synagogues; yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think
   that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you,
   because they have not known the Father, nor me. But these things have I
   told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told
   you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning,
   because I was with you. But now I go my way to him that sent me; and
   none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But because I have said
   these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I
   tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I

   284 EXTRACTS FROM THE LENTEN TRIODION.

   go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I
   will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world
   of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they
   believe not on me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye
   see me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is
   judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
   now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
   into all truth; for he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he
   shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will shew you things to come.
   He shall glorify me; for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it
   unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I,
   that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. A little while
   and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see
   me, because I go to the Father. Then said some of his disciples among
   themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye
   shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, and,
   Because I go to the Father? They said therefore, What is this that he
   saith, A little while? We cannot tell what he saith. Now Jesus knew
   that they were desirous

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 285

   to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourself of that I
   said, A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little
   while, and ye shall see me? Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye
   shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and ye shall be
   sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she
   is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon as she
   is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy
   that a man is born into the world. And ye now therefore have sorrow;
   but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no
   man taketh from you. And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name,
   he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask,
   and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. These things have I
   spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh, when I shall no more
   speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
   At that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not unto you, that I
   will pray the Father for you; for the Father himself loveth you,
   because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. I
   came forth from the Father, and am

   His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
   speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and
   needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou
   earnest forth from God. Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? Behold,
   the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every
   man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone,
   because the Father is with me. These things I have spoken unto you,
   that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation;
   but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. These words spake
   Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is
   come: glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee; as thou hast
   given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as
   many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might
   know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. I
   have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou
   gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self
   with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. I have
   manifested thy name unto the men

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 287

   which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest
   them me; and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all
   things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I have given unto
   them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and
   have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed
   that thou didst send me. I pray for them: I pray not for the world but
   for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are
   thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. And now I am no
   more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy
   Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that
   they may be one, as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept
   them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of
   them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be
   fulfilled. And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the
   world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have
   given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are
   not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou
   shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep

   them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the
   world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast
   sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
   And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
   sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for
   them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all
   may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also
   may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
   And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be
   one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be
   made perfect in one; and that the world may know, that thou hast sent
   me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father, I will that
   they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they
   may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me
   before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world hath
   not known thee; but I have known thee, and these have known that thou
   hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare
   it; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in
   them. When Jesus had

   And the Priest readeth GOSPEL II. FROM S. JOHN.

   T that time, Jesus went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron,
   where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. And
   Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place; for Jesus ofttimes
   resorted thither with his disciples. Judas then, having received a band
   of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh
   thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing
   all things that should come upon him, went forth and said unto them,
   Whom seek ye ? They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto
   them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. As
   soon then as lie had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and
   fell to the ground. Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they
   said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he:
   if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way; that the saying might
   be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost
   none. Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
   priest'ÃÃ´s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant'ÃÃ´s name

   was Malchus. Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the
   sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
   Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and
   bound him. And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to
   Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. Now Caiaphas was
   he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man
   should die for the people. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did
   another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and
   went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. But Peter stood
   at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known
   unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and
   brought in Peter. Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter,
   Art not thou also one of this man'ÃÃ´s disciples ? He saith, I am not.
   And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of
   coals; for it was cold. And they warmed themselves, and Peter stood
   with them, and warmed himself. The high priest then asked Jesus of his
   disciples, and of his doctrine. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to
   the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither
   the Jews always

   them which heard me what I have said unto them: behold, they know what
   I said. And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
   struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high
   priest so? Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of
   the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? Now Annas had sent him
   bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. And Simon Peter stood and warmed
   himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his
   disciples ? He denied it, and said, I am not. One of the servants of
   the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did
   not I see thee in the garden with him? Peter then denied again; and
   immediately the cock crew. Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the
   hall of judgment. And it was early; and they themselves went not into
   the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat

   T that time, the soldiers that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to
   Caia-phas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
   assembled. But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest'ÃÃ´s
   palace, and went in and sat with the servants to see the end. Now the
   chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness
   against Jesus, to put him to death; but found none: yea, though many
   false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false
   witnesses, and said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple
   of God, and to build it in three days. And the high priest arose, and
   said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? What is it which these witness
   against thee ? But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered
   and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us
   whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus saith unto him, Thou
   hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son
   of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in

   the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He
   hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold,
   now ye have heard his blasphemy. What think ye ? They answered and
   said, He is guilty of death. Then did they spit in his face, and
   buffeted him, and others smote him with the palms of their hands,
   saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ. Who is he that smote thee ? Now
   Peter sat without in the palace; and a damsel came unto him, saying,
   Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. But he denied before them all,
   saying, I know not what thou sayest. And when he was gone out into the
   porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This
   fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he denied with an
   oath, I do not know the man. And after a while came unto him they that
   stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy
   speech bewrayeth thee. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I
   know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered
   the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou
   shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

   again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the

   others tell it thee of me ? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew ? Thine own
   nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast
   thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world : if my
   kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should
   not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence.
   Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered,
   Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was Iborn, and for this cause
   came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every
   one that is of the truth heareth my voice. Pilate saith unto him, What
   is truth ? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews,
   and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. But ye have a
   custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye
   therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ? Then cried
   they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a
   robber. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. And the
   soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they
   put on him a purple robe, and

   Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring

   came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And
   Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! When the chief priests
   therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him,
   crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him; for
   I find no fault in him. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by
   our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. When
   Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; and went
   again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou?
   But Jesus gave him no answer. Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou
   not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and
   have power to release thee ? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no
   power at all against me, except it were given thee from above;
   therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. And from
   thenceforth Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out,
   saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not C?Â¶sar'ÃÃ´s friend:
   whosoever maketh himself a king

   speaketh against C?Â¶sar. When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he
   brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat in a place that
   is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the
   preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour; and he saith
   unto the Jews, Behold your King! But they cried out, Away with him,
   away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify

   blood. And they said, What is that to us? See thou to that. And he cast
   down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and
   hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said,
   It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the
   price of blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them the
   potter'ÃÃ´s field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was
   called, The field of blood, unto this day. Then was fulfilled that
   which was spoken by Jeremy the Prophet, saying, And they took the
   thirty pieces

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 3O9

   of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children
   of Israel did value; and gave them for the potter'ÃÃ´s field, as the
   Lord appointed me. And Jesus stood before the governor; and the
   governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus
   said unto him, Thou sayest. And when he was accused of the chief
   priests and elders, he answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him,
   Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? And he
   answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled
   greatly. Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
   people a prisoner, whom they would. And they had then a notable
   prisoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together,
   Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas,
   or Jesus which is called Christ ? For he knew that for envy they had
   delivered him. When he was set down on the judgment-seat, his wife sent
   unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I
   have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. But the
   chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask
   Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. The governor answered and said unto them,
   Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They

   said, Barabbas. Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus
   which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
   And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out
   the more, saying, Let him be crucified. When Pilate saw that he could
   prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and
   washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the
   blood of this just person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people,
   and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. Then released he
   Barabbas unto them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to
   be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the
   common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. And they
   stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted
   a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right
   hand; and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail,
   King of the Jews! And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote
   him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe
   off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
   crucify him. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon

   HE Jewish assembly desired Pilate to crucify thee, O Lord, and though
   they found no accusation against thee, they freed the criminal Barabbas
   and condemned thee, the Just One, thereby inheriting the charge of
   bloodguiltiness. But give them, O Lord, their reward; for in vain they
   strove against thee.

   Him before whom all things fear and tremble, and whom all tongues sing,
   even Christ, the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, him do the priests

   the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees
   worshipped him. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple
   from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify
   him. And they compel one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
   of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his Cross.
   And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
   interpreted, The place of a skull. And they gave him to drink wine
   mingled with myrrh; but he received it not. And when they had crucified
   him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man
   should take. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. And the
   superscription of his accusation was written over, The King of the
   Jews. And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand,
   and the other on his left. And the scripture was fulfilled, which
   saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. And they that passed
   by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that
   destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself, and
   come down from the Cross. Likewise also the chief priests mocking said
   among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot
   save. Let Christ the King of Israel

   descend now from the Cross, that we may see and believe in him.

   Then we sing the Beatitudes in Tone 4.

   thou comest in thy kingdom.

   Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

   Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.

   Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

   Through the tree Adam became an exile from Paradise. Through the tree
   of the Cross the thief became an inhabitant thereof. For the one,
   having tasted, transgressed the commandment of his Maker; but the
   other, being crucified, confessed his hidden God. Remember us also, O
   Saviour, in thy kingdom.

   Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for
   they shall be filled.

   The wicked have bought the Maker of the law of his disciple, and placed
   him as a malefactor at the judgment - seat of Pilate, crying, Crucify
   him, even him that gave them manna in the wilderness. But we, imitating
   the righteous thief, cry out in faith, Remember us also, O Saviour, in
   thy kingdom.

   3I6 EXTRACTS FROM THE LENTEN TRIODION.

   Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.

   The assembly of God-slayers, even the wicked nation of the Jews, cried
   madly unto Pilate, saying, Crucify him, even the innocent Christ, and
   give us rather Barabbas. But we lift up unto him the voice of the
   right-judging thief. Remember us also, O Saviour, in thy kingdom.

   Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

   Thy life-giving side, as a fountain springing out of Eden, watereth
   that reasonable Paradise, which is thy Church, O Christ, and branching
   off in her into four rivers, the four Gospels, nourisheth the world,
   maketh all creation joyful, and teacheth the nations faithfully to
   worship thy kingdom.

   Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of
   God.

   Thou wast crucified for me that thou mightest send forth forgiveness
   unto me. Thou wast pierced in the side that thou mightest spring forth
   unto me streams of life. Thou wast affixed with nails that I, by the
   depth of thy Passion being convinced of the height of thy power, might
   cry unto thee, O life-giving Christ, Glory to thy Cross, O Saviour, and
   to thy Passion.

   Blessed are they which are persecuted for

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 317

   righteousness'ÃÃ´ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

   When thou wast crucified, O Christ, all creation beholding trembled,
   the foundations of the earth shook with fear of thy power, the
   luminaries became darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent, the
   mountains groaned, and the rocks were rent, while the believing thief
   crieth unto thee with us, O Saviour, Remember me.

   Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall
   say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.

   Upon the Cross, O Lord, thou didst tear up the bond of our sins, and,
   numbered among the dead, thou didst bind the tyrant of them there,
   delivering all by thy Resurrection from the bonds of death, through
   which we are enlightened, O man-loving Lord, and cry unto thee,
   Remember us also, O Saviour, in thy kingdom.

   Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.

   Thou that wast lifted on the Cross, and didst annul the might of death,
   and didst, O Lord, as God, blot out the handwriting against us;
   vouchsafe, O Christ our God, thou only Lover of mankind, the repentance
   of the thief to us who worship thee in faith,

   Ye faithful, let us with one accord pray worthily to glorify the
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the divine Unity existing in three
   Persons, abiding unconfounded, Oneness undivided and unapproachable, by
   whom we are delivered from the fiery punishment.

   Both now. To the Virgin.

   Thy Mother, O Christ, who without seed brought thee forth in flesh, and
   after bringing forth truly remained an undefiled Virgin, the same we
   bring unto thee as mediatress, O most merciful Master, that we at all
   times may gain forgiveness of our iniquities, even us who cry, Remember

   T that time, when the soldiers were

   come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, A place of a skull,
   they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall; and when he had
   tasted thereof,

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 319

   he would not drink. And they crucified him, and parted his garments,
   casting lots; that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the
   Prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
   they cast lots. And sitting down they watched him there; and set up
   over his head his accusation written, This is Jesus the King of the
   Jews. Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
   hand, and another on the left. And they that passed by reviled him,
   wagging their heads, and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and
   buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God,
   come down from the Cross. Likewise also the chief priests mocking him,
   with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot
   save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the
   Cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God: let him deliver him
   now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves
   also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. Now
   from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth
   hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
   Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood

   there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. And
   straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with
   vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. The rest said,
   Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. Jesus, when he
   had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold,
   the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom;
   and the eaith did quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves were
   opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out
   of the graves after his Resurrection, and went into the holy city, and
   appeared unto many. Now when the centurion, and they that were with
   him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were
   done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

   Then the Reader intoneth Psalm 50 (51). And after this the Priest
   readeth

   T that time were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to
   death. And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
   there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
   and the other on the left.

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. 321

   Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.
   And they parted his raiment and cast lots. And the people stood
   beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved
   others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. And
   the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
   and saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. And a
   superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and
   Latin, and Hebrew, This is the King of the Jews. And one of the
   malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ,
   save thyself and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost
   not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we
   indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man
   hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when
   thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say
   unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise. And it was about
   the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the
   ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was
   rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said,

   322 EXTRACTS FROM THE LENTEN TRIOD1ON.

   Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And having said thus, he
   gave up the ghost. Now when the centurion saw what was done, he
   glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. And all the
   people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which
   were done, smote their breasts, and returned. And all his aquaintance,
   and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding
   these things.

   T that time, there stood by the Cross of Jesus his Mother, and his
   Mother'ÃÃ´s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When
   Jesus therefore saw his Mother, and the Disciple standing by, whom he
   loved, he saith unto his Mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith he
   to the Disciple, Behold thy Mother! And from that hour that Disciple
   took her unto his own home. After this, Jesus knowing that all things
   were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I
   thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar; and they filled a
   spunge with vinegar, and

   THE PASSION OF THE LORD. style=" 327

   put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had
   received the vinegar, he said, It is finished. And he bowed his head,
   and gave up the ghost. The Jews therefore, because it was the
   preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the
   sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate
   that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
   Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the
   other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, and
   saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs; but one of the
   soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came thereout
   blood and water. And he that saw it bare record, and his record is
   true; and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. For
   these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone
   of him shall not be broken. And again another scripture saith, They
   shall look on him whom they pierced.

   O

   LORD, when thou wast raised on the

   Cross, trembling and fear fell on creation. Yet thou forbadest earth to
   swallow them that crucified thee, but gavest thyself to hades to send

   GOSPEL XII. FROM S. MATTHEW.

   N the morrow that followeth the day of the preparation, the chief
   priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we
   remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three
   days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made
   sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal
   him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the
   last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye
   have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they went, and
   made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

   name for ever. For righteous art thou concerning all things which thou
   hast done unto us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways righteous,
   and all thy judgments are true. And thou hast made a decree of truth
   concerning all things which thou hast brought upon us, and upon
   Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers. For in truth and judgment hast
   thou brought all these things upon us on account of our sins. For we
   have sinned and transgressed through turning away from thee. And in all
   things we have sinned exceedingly, and thy commandments we have not
   kept, nor loved them, nor done that which thou hast commanded us, to
   the intent that it might be well with us. And all the things that thou
   hast done unto us, and all the things that thou hast brought upon us in
   true judgment have been wrought. And thou hast delivered us into the

   thou didst promise to multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and

   thee, for there is no shame for them that put their trust in thee. And

   THE MATINS

   ON THE HOLY AND GREAT SUNDAY OF

   PASC HA,

   COMMONLY CALLED,

   EASTER DAY.

   As soon as the day beginneth, the bells are rung, and the Warden
   lighteth all the candles and lamps in the Church, and placeth two
   vessels holding burning charcoal, one in the Altar and the other in the
   middle of the Church, and casteth into them much incense, that the
   Church may be filled with sweet perfume. And the Western Gates of the
   Church are shut. And the Priest and Deacon put on their brightest
   vestments, and tapers are distributed. And the Priest laketh the
   honourable Cross, and the Deacon the censer,

   THE MATINS ON HOLY PASCHA. 379

   and, with lamps borne before them and accompanied by the Choir, they go
   into the Porch, singing the Sticheron in Tone 7.

   HY Resurrection, O Saviour Christ, Angels sing in heaven. Vouchsafe to
   us also upon earth to extol thee with pure heart.

   And the Priest, taking the censer from the Deacon in his right hand,
   and holding the honourable Cross in his left, censeth as customarily,
   and all stand around with burning tapers.

   And the Priest exclaimeth,

   G

   LORY to the holy, consubstantial, life-giving and undivided Trinity,
   always, now and ever, and to ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen.

   Then the Priest intoneth the Troparion in Tone 5.

   HRIST is risen from the dead, death by death down doth he tread, and on
   those within the tombs he be-stoweth life.

   And we repeat the same with melody. And thrice is it thus sung by the
   Priest and by us. Then the Priest intoneth these verses.

   L

   ET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered, and let them that hate
   him flee from before him.

   380 EXTRACTS FROM THE FERIAL TRIODION.

   As smoke is driven away, so drive them away, as wax melteth at the
   presence of fire,

   So let the sinners perish at the presence of God, but let the righteous
   rejoice.

   This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoice and be glad
   therein.

   Glory. Both now.

   And after every verse we sing the Tropar-ion, Christ is risen . . . .

   Then the Priest loudly singeth,

   C

   HRIST is risen from the dead, death by death down doth he tread.

   And the Gates are opened, and he entereth, carrying the honourable
   Cross and accompanied by the Deacon, with lamps borne before them, and
   by the Choir singing,

   A

   ND on those within the tombs he be-stoweth life.

   And the Priest entereth the Altar, and the Deacon, standing on the
   Ambo, saith the Ectenia of Peace.

   In peace let us pray to the Lord. And the rest. Vide page 2.

   Then followeth the Canon in Tone I.

   Ode I. Irmos.

   the Lord'ÃÃ´s Pascha. For, from death to life, and from earth to heaven
   Christ our God hath brought us over, singing the hymn of victory.

   Refrain. Christ is risen . . . .

   Let us cleanse our senses, and we shall behold Christ shining in the
   inaccessible light of the Resurrection, and shall clearly hear him
   saying, Hail! to us, singing the hymn of victory.

   Let the heavens, as is meet, be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and
   let the world, visible and invisible, keep festival; for Christ hath
   risen, everlasting Joy.

   Then again the Irmos. It is the day of Resurrection . . . .

   And the Little Ectenia is said.

   NOTE:'ÃÃ®This followeth all the Odes.

   Ode III. Irmos.

   O

   barren rock, but the fountain of immortality, which is poured from the
   grave by Christ, in whom we are established.

   Now all things are filled with light, heaven, and earth, and things
   beneath the earth. Then let all creation keep festival for Christ'ÃÃ´s
   arising, in which it is established.

   risen, hath been the death of death, and that he is the Son of God that
   saveth the race of men.

   divinely-speaking Abba-cum, and shew us the light-bearing Angel
   unceasingly proclaiming, To-day is salvation to the world; for Christ,

   Christ hath appeared as a male, opening the Virgin'ÃÃ´s womb. As our
   food he is called a Lamb, and undefiled; as free from stain,

   our Pascha; and, as true God, he is named, Perfect.

   As a yearling lamb, Christ, our blessed crown, of his own will, as
   cleansing Pascha, was sacrificed for all; and again to us from the
   grave hath shone, as the glorious Sun of righteousness.

   Before the foreshadowing ark David, Forefather of God, leaped and
   danced. And let us, God'ÃÃ´s holy people, seeing the types'ÃÃ´

   Lord a song, and we shall see Christ, the Sun of righteousness, shining
   life to all.

   They that were held by hades'ÃÃ´ chains, when they beheld thy gentle
   pity, Christ, hurried onward to the light, praising with joyful feet

   cometh from the tomb. And let us, with the festal-loving ranks,
   together celebrate the saving Pascha of our God.

   break the eternal bars which held the captives; and on the third day,
   as Jonas from the whale, didst from the grave arise.

   Keeping the seals unbroken, thou, O Christ, didst from the grave arise,
   who, in thy birth, didst not destroy the Virgin bars; and thou hast
   opened unto us the gates of Paradise.

   My Saviour, who as God didst to the Father bring, of thine own will,
   thyself a living and unsacrificed victim, rising from the grave, hast
   raised with thyself Adam and all his race.

   grave; and they cried to one another, O Friends! Come, let us anoint
   with spices the quickening buried Body, the Flesh that raiseth fallen
   Adam, lying in the tomb. Let us go on, hastening like the Magi, and let
   us worship and bring the myrrh as gift to him, no longer wrapped in
   swaddling-clothes, but in fine linen, and let us weep and cry, Arise, O
   Lord, who givest resurrection to the fallen.

   Then we sing,

   a truth, O Christ, to be with us until the world doth end. Having this
   steadfast hope, we, thy faithful ones, rejoice.

   O Christ, thou great, most sacred Pascha, Wisdom, and Word, and Power

   harp.

   Sticheron. O Lord, who didst endure the Cross, and didst abolish death,
   and rise again from the dead; give us peace in our life, who alone art
   almighty.

   Praise him with timbrel and choir, praise him with stringed instruments
   and organ.

   Sticheron. O Christ, who didst spoil hades and raise man by thy
   Resurrection; vouchsafe that, with pure heart, we may hymn and glorify
   thee.

   Praise him with well-tuned cymbals, praise him with loud cymbals. Let
   everything that hath breath praise the Lord.

   Sticheron. We glorify thy Godlike condescension, and sing to thee, O
   Christ. Thou wast born of the Virgin and wast inseparably with the
   Father. Thou didst suffer as man, and didst, of thine own will, endure
   the Cross. Thou didst arise from the tomb, going out thence as from a
   bridal chamber to save the world. Glory to thee, O Lord.

   O-DAY the sacred Pascha is made manifest to us, the new and holy
   Pascha, the mystic Pascha, the all-honourable Pascha, the Pascha which
   is Christ the Redeemer, the spotless Pascha, the mighty Pascha, the
   Pascha of the faithful, the Pascha that openeth unto us the gates of
   Paradise, the Pascha that halloweth all the faithful.

   Verse. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away, as wax melteth at
   the presence of fire.

   light-bearing Day of the most glorious and saving Resurrection of
   Christ our God.

   E that is pious and God-loving, let him enjoy this good and bright
   triumphal Feast. He that is a wise and prudent servant, let the same
   joyfully enter into the joy of his Master. He that hath laboured in
   fasting, let him now receive his denarius. He that hath worked from the
   first hour, let him to-day receive his just award. He that came at the
   end of the third hour, let him keep the Feast with thanksgiving. He
   that came only at the sixth hour, let him have no doubt, for he is in
   nowise rejected. He that missed even the ninth hour, let him approach,
   nothing doubting, nothing fearing. He that arrived even at the eleventh
   hour, let him not fear on account of his delay. For the Lord, being
   condescending, accepteth the last comer as the first, he resteth him
   that cometh at the eleventh hour as he resteth him that worked from the
   first hour, and he hath mercy on the last and sheweth favour to the
   first, and on this one bestoweth and to that one granteth, and he
   welcometh the deeds and kisseth the intentions, respecteth the work and
   approveth the purpose. Then come ye all into the joy of your Lord. Ye

   The calf is a fattened one, let no one depart a hungred. Enjoy ye all
   the Feast of faith. Receive ye all the riches of grace. Let no one
   bewail his unworthiness, for the kingdom of all hath come. Let no one
   lament over his sins, for pardon hath shone like a light from the tomb.
   Let no one fear death, for our Saviour'ÃÃ´s death hath liberated us. He
   who was bound by it hath extinguished it. Descending into hades, he
   made hades captive, and he moved it that had tasted of his flesh.
   Foreseeing this same, Esaias exclaimed, Hades, saith he, from beneath
   is moved, for it is cast away by thee. It is moved, for it is crushed.
   It is moved, for it is slain. It is moved, for it is overthrown. It is
   moved, for it is made captive. It took the flesh, and discovered God.
   It took the clay, and met heaven. It took what it saw, and fell into
   what it did not see. Where is thy sting, O death? Where is thy victory,
   O hades? Christ hath arisen, and thou art overthrown. Christ hath
   arisen, and the demons have fallen. Christ hath arisen, and the Angels
   rejoice. Christ hath arisen, and

   pertaining to the kingdom of God. And, being assembled together with
   them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but
   wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of
   me. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
   the Holy Ghost not many days hence. When they therefore were come
   together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time
   restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, It is not
   for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in
   his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is
   come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and

   N the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
   was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made
   by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was
   life, and the life was the light of men. And the

   398 EXTRACTS FROM THE FERIAL TRIODION.

   light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. There
   was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a
   witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might
   believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
   Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
   into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and
   the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him
   not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
   sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born,
   not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
   of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld
   his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of
   grace and truth. John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was
   he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for
   he was before me. And of his fulness have we all received, and grace
   for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by

   It is very meet . . . . Vide page 6I.

   Glory. Both now.

   Lord, have mercy, thrice.

   O

   LORD Jesus Christ, Son of God, for the sake of the prayers of thy most
   holy Mother, of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers, and of all the
   Saints, have mercy upon us. Amen.

   XXVII. OF THE RECITATION

   OF THE PSALTER.

   The Psalter is divided into 20 Kathisms, and each of these is
   subdivided into 3 parts, called Stases, according to Table I.

   And the Kathisms are recited in the Daily Office according to Table II.

   NOTE:'ÃÃ®At the conclusion of every Stasis the Reader saith,

   Glory to the Father . . . .

   And the Choir singeth,

   Both now, and ever . . . .

   Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God, thrice.

   Lord, have mercy, thrice.

   Glory to the Father . . . .

   Then the Reader saith,

   Both now, and ever . . . .

   And continueth reading, beginning the next Stasis.
