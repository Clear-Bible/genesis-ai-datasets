  PSALM 1

   C. M.

   The way and end of the righteous and the wicked.


   Blest is the man who shuns the place

   Where sinners love to meet;

   Who fears to tread their wicked ways,

   And hates the scoffer's seat:


   But in the statutes of the Lord

   Has placed his chief delight;

   By day he reads or hears the word,

   And meditates by night.


   [He, like a plant of gen'rous kind,

   By living waters set,

   Safe from the storms and blasting wind,

   Enjoys a peaceful state.]


   Green as the leaf, and ever fair,

   Shall his profession shine

   While fruits of holiness appear

   Like clusters on the vine.


   Not so the impious and unjust;

   What vain designs they form!

   Their hopes are blown away like dust,

   Or chaff before the storm.


   Sinners in judgment shall not stand

   Amongst the sons of grace,

   When Christ, the Judge, at his right hand

   Appoints his saints a place.


   His eye beholds the path they tread,

   His heart approves it well

   But crooked ways of sinners lead

   Down to the gates of hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 1

   S. M.

   The saint happy, the sinner miserable.


   The man is ever blessed

   Who shuns the sinners' ways,

   Among their counsels never stands,

   Nor takes the scorner's place;


   But makes the law of God

   His study and delight,

   Amidst the labors of the day,

   And watches of the night.


   He like a tree shall thrive,

   With waters near the root;

   Fresh as the leaf his name shall live;

   His works are heav'nly fruit.


   Not so th' ungodly race,

   They no such blessings find;

   Their hopes shall flee, like empty chaff

   Before the driving wind.


   How will they bear to stand

   Before that judgment-seat,

   Where all the saints at Christ's right hand

   In full assembly meet?


   He knows, and he approves,

   The way the righteous go;

   But sinners and their works shall meet

   A dreadful overthrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 1

   L. M.

   The difference between the righteous and the wicked.


   Happy the man whose cautious feet

   Shun the broad way that sinners go,

   Who hates the place where atheists meet,

   And fears to talk as scoffers do.


   He loves t' employ the morning light

   Amongst the statutes of the Lord;

   And spends the wakeful hours of night,

   With pleasure, pondering o'er his word.


   He, like a plant by gentle streams,

   Shall flourish in immortal green.

   And heav'n will shine with kindest beams

   On every work his hands begin.


   But sinners find their counsels crossed:

   As chaff before the tempest flies,

   So shall their hopes be blown and lost,

   When the last trumpet shakes the skies.


   In vain the rebel seeks to stand

   In judgment with the pious race;

   The dreadful Judge, with stern command,

   Divides him to a diff'rent place.


   "Straight is the way my saints have trod;

   I blessed the path, and drew it plain;

   But you would choose the crooked road,

   And down it leads to endless pain."
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 2

   S. M.

   Translated according to the Divine pattern, Acts 4:24, etc. Christ
   dying, rising, interceding, and reigning.

   PAUSE.


   [Maker and sovereign Lord

   Of heav'n, and earth, and seas,

   Thy providence confirms thy word,

   And answers thy decrees.


   The things so long foretold

   By David are fulfilled,

   When Jews and Gentiles joined to slay

   Jesus, thine holy child.]


   Why did the Gentiles rage,

   And Jews, with one accord,

   Bend all their counsels to destroy

   Th' Anointed of the Lord?


   Rulers and kings agree

   To form a vain design;

   Against the Lord their powers unite,

   Against his Christ they join.


   The Lord derides their rage,

   And will support his throne;

   He that hath raised him from the dead

   Hath owned him for his Son.


   Now he's ascended high,

   And asks to rule the earth

   The merit of his blood he pleads,

   And pleads his heav'nly birth.


   He asks, and God bestows

   A large inheritance;

   Far as the world's remotest ends

   His kingdom shall advance.


   The nations that rebel

   Must feel his iron rod;

   He'll vindicate those honors well

   Which he received from God.


   [Be wise, ye rulers, now,

   And worship at his throne;

   With trembling joy, ye people, bow

   To God's exalted Son.


   If once his wrath arise,

   Ye perish on the place;

   Then blessed is the soul that flies

   For refuge to his grace.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 2

   C. M.

   Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.


   Why did the nations join to slay

   The Lord's anointed Son?

   Why did they cast his laws away,

   And tread his gospel down?


   The Lord, that sits above the skies,

   Derides their rage below;

   He speaks with vengeance in his eyes,

   And strikes their spirits through.


   "I call him my Eternal Son,

   And raise him from the dead;

   I make my holy hill his throne,

   And wide his kingdom spread.


   "Ask me, my Son, and then enjoy

   The utmost heathen lands:

   Thy rod of iron shall destroy

   The rebel that withstands."


   Be wise, ye rulers of the earth,

   Obey th' anointed Lord,

   Adore the King of heav'nly birth,

   And tremble at his word.


   With humble love address his throne;

   For if he frown, ye die:

   Those are secure, and those alone,

   Who on his grace rely.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 2

   L. M.

   Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.

   PAUSE.


   Why did the Jews proclaim their rage?

   The Romans, why their swords employ?

   Against the Lord their powers engage,

   His dear Anointed to destroy?


   "Come, let us break his bands," they say,

   "This man shall never give us laws:"

   And thus they cast his yoke away,

   And nailed the Monarch to the cross.


   But God, who high in glory reigns,

   Laughs at their pride, their rage controls,

   He'll vex their hearts with inward pains,

   And speak in thunder to their souls.


   "I will maintain the King I made

   On Zion's everlasting hill;

   My hand shall bring him from the dead,

   And he shall stand your Sovereign still."


   [His wondrous rising from the earth

   Makes his eternal Godhead known;

   The Lord declares his heav'nly birth,

   "This day have I begot my Son.


   "Ascend, my Son, to my right hand,

   There thou shalt ask, and I bestow,

   The utmost bounds of heathen lands;

   To thee the Northern Isles shall bow."]


   But nations that resist his grace

   Shall fall beneath his iron stroke;

   His rod shall crush his foes with ease,

   As potters' earthen work is broke.


   Now, ye that sit on earthly thrones,

   Be wise, and serve the Lord, the Lamb;

   Now at his feet submit your crowns,

   Rejoice and tremble at his name.


   With humble love address the Son,

   Lest he grow angry, and ye die;

   His wrath will burn to worlds unknown,

   If ye provoke his jealousy.


   His storms shall drive you quick to hell;

   He is a God, and ye but dust:

   Happy the souls that know him well,

   And make his grace their only trust.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 3

   C. M.

   Doubts and fears suppressed.


   My God, how many are my fears!

   How fast my foes increase!

   Conspiring my eternal death,

   They break my present peace.


   The lying tempter would persuade

   There's no relief in heav'n;

   And all my swelling sins appear

   Too big to be forgiv'n.


   But thou, my glory and my strength,

   Shalt on the tempter tread,

   Shalt silence all my threatening guilt,

   And raise my drooping head.


   [I cried, and from his holy hill

   He bowed a listening ear;

   I called my Father, and my God,

   And he subdued my fear.


   He shed soft slumbers on mine eyes,

   In spite of all my foes;

   I woke, and wondered at the grace

   That guarded my repose.]


   What though the hosts of death and hell

   All armed against me stood,

   Terrors no more shall shake my soul;

   My refuge is my God.


   Arise, O Lord, fulfil thy grace,

   While I thy glory sing;

   My God has broke the serpent's teeth,

   And death has lost his sting.


   Salvation to the Lord belongs;

   His arm alone can save:

   Blessings attend thy people here,

   And reach beyond the grave.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 3

   v. 1-5,8

   L. M.

   A Morning Psalm.


   O Lord, how many are my foes,

   In this weak state of flesh and blood!

   My peace they daily discompose,

   But my defence and hope is God.


   Tired with the burdens of the day,

   To thee I raised an evening cry:

   Thou heard'st when I began to pray,

   And thine almighty help was nigh.


   Supported by thine heav'nly aid,

   I laid me down, and slept secure:

   Not death should make my heart afraid,

   Though I should wake and rise no more.


   But God sustained me all the night:

   Salvation doth to God belong;

   He raised my head to see the light,

   And make his praise my morning song.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 4

   v. 1-3,5-7

   L. M.

   Hearing of prayer.


   O God of grace and righteousness,

   Hear and attend when I complain;

   Thou hast enlarged me in distress,

   Bow down a gracious ear again.


   Ye sons of men, in vain ye try

   To turn my glory into shame;

   How long will scoffers love to lie,

   And dare reproach my Savior's name?


   Know that the Lord divides his saints

   From all the tribes of men beside;

   He hears the cry of penitents,

   For the dear sake of Christ that died.


   When our obedient bands have done

   A thousand works of righteousness,

   We put our trust in God alone,

   And glory in his pardoning grace.


   Let the unthinking many say,

   "Who will bestow some earthly good?"

   But, Lord, thy light and love we pray;

   Our souls desire this heav'nly food.


   Then shall my cheerful powers rejoice,

   At grace and favors so divine;

   Nor will I change my happy choice

   For all their corn, and all their wine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 4

   v. 3-5,8

   C. M.

   An Evening Psalm.


   Lord, thou wilt hear me when I pray,

   I am for ever thine;

   I fear before thee all the day,

   Nor would I dare to sin.


   And while I rest my weary head,

   From cares and business free,

   'Tis sweet conversing on my bed,

   With my own heart and thee.


   I pay this evening sacrifice:

   And when my work is done,

   Great God, my faith and hope relies

   Upon thy grace alone.


   Thus, with my thoughts composed to pray,

   I'll give mine eyes to sleep;

   Thy hand in safety keeps my days,

   And will my slumbers keep.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 5

   C. M.

   For the Lord's Day Morning.

   PAUSE.


   Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear

   My voice ascending high;

   To thee will I direct my prayer,

   To thee lift up mine eye;


   Up to the hills where Christ is gone

   To plead for all his saints,

   Presenting at his Father's throne

   Our songs and our complaints.


   Thou art a God, before whose sight

   The wicked shall not stand;

   Sinners shall ne'er be thy delight,

   Nor dwell at thy right hand.


   But to thy house will I resort,

   To taste thy mercies there;

   I will frequent thine holy court,

   And worship in thy fear.


   O may thy Spirit guide my feet

   In ways of righteousness!

   Make every path of duty straight,

   And plain before my face.


   My watchful enemies combine

   To tempt my feet astray;

   They flatter, with a base design

   To make my soul their prey.


   Lord, crush the serpent in the dust,

   And all his plots destroy;

   While those that in thy mercy trust,

   For ever shout for joy.


   The men that love and fear thy name

   Shall see their hopes fulfilled;

   The mighty God will compass them

   With favor as a shield.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 6

   C. M.

   Complaint in sickness.


   In anger, Lord, rebuke me not;

   Withdraw the dreadful storm;

   Nor let thy fury grow so hot

   Against a feeble worm.


   My soul's bowed down with heavy cares,

   My flesh with pain oppressed;

   My couch is witness to my tears,

   My tears forbid my rest.


   Sorrow and pain wear out my days,

   I waste the night with cries,

   Counting the minutes as they pass,

   Till the slow morning rise.


   Shall I be still tormented more?

   Mine eye consumed with grief?

   How long, my God, how long before

   Thine hand afford relief?


   He hears when dust and ashes speak,

   He pities all our groans;

   He saves us for his mercy's sake,

   And heals our broken bones.


   The virtue of his sovereign word

   Restores our fainting breath;

   For silent graves praise not the Lord,

   Nor is he known in death.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 6

   L. M.

   Temptations in sickness overcome.


   Lord, I can suffer thy rebukes,

   When thou with kindness dost chastise;

   But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear:

   O let it not against me rise.


   Pity my languishing estate,

   And ease the sorrows that I feel;

   The wounds thine heavy hand hath made,

   O let thy gentler touches heal!


   See how I pass my weary days

   In sighs and groans; and when 'tis night

   My bed is watered with my tears;

   My grief consumes, and dims my sight.


   Look, how the powers of nature mourn!

   How long, Almighty God, how long?

   When shall thine hour of grace return?

   When shall I make thy grace my song?


   I feel my flesh so near the grave,

   My thoughts are tempted to despair;

   But graves can never praise the Lord,

   For all is dust and silence there.


   Depart, ye tempters, from my soul,

   And all despairing thoughts, depart;

   My God, who hears lily humble moan,

   Will ease my flesh, and cheer my heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 7

   C. M.

   God's care of his people.

   PAUSE.


   My trust is in my heav'nly Friend,

   My hope in thee, my God;

   Rise, and my helpless life defend

   From those that seek my blood.


   With insolence and fury they

   My soul in pieces tear,

   As hungry lions rend the prey,

   When no deliverer's near.


   If I had e'er provoked them first,

   Or once abused my foe,

   Then let him tread my life to dust,

   And lay mine honor low.


   If there be malice found in me,

   I know thy piercing eyes;

   I should not dare appeal to thee,

   Nor ask my God to rise.


   Arise, my God, lift up thy hand,

   Their pride and power control;

   Awake to judgment, and command

   Deliverance for my soul.


   [Let sinners, and their wicked rage,

   Be humbled to the dust;

   Shall not the God of truth engage

   To vindicate the just?


   He knows the heart, he tries the reins,

   He will defend th' upright

   His sharpest arrows he ordains

   Against the sons of spite.


   For me their malice digged a pit,

   But there themselves are cast;

   My God makes all their mischief light

   On their own heads at last.]


   That cruel, persecuting race

   Must feel his dreadful sword:

   Awake, my soul, and praise the grace

   And justice of the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 8

   S. M.

   God's sovereignty and goodness.


   O Lord, our heav'nly King,

   Thy name is all divine;

   Thy glories round the earth are spread,

   And o'er the heav'ns they shine.


   When to thy works on high

   I raise my wondering eyes,

   And see the moon, complete in light,

   Adorn the darksome skies


   When I survey the stars,

   And all their shining forms,

   Lord, what is man, that worthless thing,

   Akin to dust and worms?


   Lord, what is worthless man,

   That thou shouldst love him so?

   Next to thine angels is he placed,

   And lord of all below.


   Thine honors crown his head,

   While beasts, like slaves, obey;

   And birds that cut the air with wings,

   And fish that cleave the sea.


   How rich thy bounties are!

   And wondrous are thy ways

   Of dust and worms thy power can frame

   A monument of praise.


   [Out of the mouths of babes

   And sucklings thou canst draw

   Surprising honors to thy name,

   And strike the world with awe.


   O Lord, our heav'nly King,

   Thy name is all divine;

   Thy glories round the earth are spread,

   And o'er the heav'ns they shine.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 8

   C. M.

   Christ's condescension and glorification.


   O LORD, our Lord, how wondrous great

   Is thine exalted name!

   The glories of thy heav'nly state

   Let men and babes proclaim.


   When I behold thy works on high,

   The moon that rules the night,

   And stars that well adorn the sky,

   Those moving worlds of light;


   Lord, what is man, or all his race,

   Who dwells so far below,

   That thou shouldst visit him with grace,

   And love his nature so?


   That thine eternal Son should bear

   To take a mortal form;

   Made lower than his angels are,

   To save a dying worm?


   [Yet while he lived on earth unknown,

   And men would not adore,

   Th' obedient seas and fishes own

   His Godhead and his power.


   The waves lay spread beneath his feet;

   And fish, at his command,

   Bring their large shoals to Peter's feet,

   Bring tribute to his hand.


   These lesser glories of the Son

   Shone through the fleshly cloud;

   Now, we behold him on his throne,

   And men confess him God.]


   Let him be crowned with majesty,

   Who bowed his head to death;

   And be his honors sounded high,

   By all things that have breath.


   Jesus, our Lord, how wondrous great

   Is thine exalted name!

   The glories of thy heav'nly state

   Let the whole earth proclaim.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 8 PART 1

   v.1,2, paraphrased.

   L. M.

   The hosanna of children.


   Almighty Ruler of the skies,

   Through the wide earth thy name is spread;

   And thine eternal glories rise

   O'er all the heav'ns thy hands have made.


   To thee the voices of the young

   A monument of honor raise;

   And babes, with uninstructed tongue,

   Declare the wonders of thy praise.


   Thy power assists their tender age

   To bring proud rebels to the ground,

   To still the bold blasphemer's rage,

   And all their policies confound.


   Children amidst thy temple throng

   To see their great Redeemer's face;

   The Son of David is their song,

   And young hosannas fill the place.


   The frowning scribes and angry priests

   In vain their impious cavils bring;

   Revenge sits silent in their breasts,

   While Jewish babes proclaim their King.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 8 PART 2

   v. 3ff, paraphrased.

   L. M.

   Adam and Christ, lords of the old and new creation.


   Lord, what was man, when made at first,

   Adam the offspring of the dust,

   That thou shouldst set him and his race

   But just below an angel's place?


   That thou shouldst raise his nature so,

   And make him lord of all below;

   Make every beast and bird submit,

   And lay the fishes at his feet?


   But, O! what brighter glories wait

   To crown the Second Adam's state!

   What honors shall thy Son adorn,

   Who condescended to be born!


   See him below his angels made;

   See him in dust amongst the dead,

   To save a ruined world from sin;

   But he shall reign with power divine.


   The world to come, redeemed from all

   The miseries that attend the fall,

   New made and glorious, shall submit

   At our exalted Savior's feet.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 9 PART 1

   vv.1-4,9-11

   C. M.

   Wrath and mercy from the judgment-seat.


   With my whole heart I'll raise my song,

   Thy wonders I'll proclaim;

   Thou, sovereign Judge of right and wrong,

   Wilt put my foes to shame.


   I'll sing thy majesty and grace;

   My God prepares his throne

   To judge the world in righteousness,

   And make his vengeance known.


   Then shall the Lord a refuge prove

   For all the poor oppressed;

   To save the people of his love,

   And give the weary rest.


   The men that know thy name will trust

   In thy abundant grace;

   For thou hast ne'er forsook the just,

   Who humbly seek thy face.


   Sing praises to the righteous Lord,

   Who dwells on Zion's hill,

   Who executes his threatening word,

   And doth his grace fulfil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 9 PART 2

   v.12ff

   C. M.

   The wisdom and equity of Providence.

   PAUSE.


   When the great Judge, supreme and just,

   Shall once inquire for blood,

   The humble souls that mourn in dust

   Shall find a faithful God.


   He from the dreadful gates of death

   Does his own children raise;

   In Zion's gates, with cheerful breath,

   They sing their Father's praise.


   His foes shall fall, with heedless feet,

   Into the pit they made;

   And sinners perish in the net

   That their own hands had spread.


   Thus, by thy judgments, mighty God,

   Are thy deep counsels known;

   When men of mischief are destroyed,

   The snare must be their own.


   The wicked shall sink down to hell;

   Thy wrath devour the lands

   That dare forget thee, or rebel

   Against thy known commands.


   Though saints to sore distress are brought,

   And wait and long complain,

   Their cries shall not be still forgot,

   Nor shall their hopes be vain.


   [Rise, great Redeemer, from thy seat,

   To judge and save the poor;

   Let nations tremble at thy feet,

   And man prevail no more.


   Thy thunder shall affright the proud,

   And put their hearts to pain;

   Make them confess that thou art God,

   And they but feeble men.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 10

   C. M.

   Prayer heard, saints saved; or, Pride, atheism, and oppressors
   punished.

   For a humiliation day.

   PAUSE.


   Why doth the Lord stand off so far?

   And why conceal his face,

   When great calamities appear,

   And times of deep distress?


   Lord, shall the wicked still deride

   Thy justice and thy power?

   Shall they advance their heads in pride,

   And still thy saints devour?


   They put thy judgments from their sight,

   And then insult the poor;

   They boast in their exalted height,

   That they shall fall no more.


   Arise, O God, lift up thine hand,

   Attend our humble cry;

   No enemy shall dare to stand

   When God ascends on high.


   Why do the men of malice rage,

   And say, with foolish pride,

   "The God of heav'n will ne'er engage

   To fight on Zion's side?"


   But thou for ever art our Lord;

   And powerful is thine hand,

   As when the heathens felt thy sword,

   And perished from thy land.


   Thou wilt prepare our hearts to pray,

   And cause thine ear to hear;

   He hearkens what his children say,

   And puts the world in fear.


   Proud tyrants shall no more oppress,

   No more despise the just;

   And mighty sinners shall confess

   They are but earth and dust.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 11

   L. M.

   God loves the righteous and hates the wicked.


   My refuge is the God of love;

   Why do my foes insult and cry,

   "Fly like a tim'rous, trembling dove,

   To distant woods or mountains fly?"


   If government be all destroyed,

   (That firm foundation of our peace,)

   And violence make justice void,

   Where shall the righteous seek redress?


   The Lord in heav'n has fixed his throne,

   His eye surveys the world below:

   To him all mortal things are known,

   His eyelids search our spirits through.


   If he afflicts his saints so far,

   To prove their love and try their grace,

   What may the bold transgressors fear?

   His very soul abhors their ways.


   On impious wretches he shall rain

   Tempests of brimstone, fire, and death;

   Such as he kindled on the plain

   Of Sodom, with his angry breath.


   The righteous Lord loves righteous souls,

   Whose thoughts and actions are sincere;

   And with a gracious eye beholds

   The men that his own image bear.

   The saint's safety and hope in evil times; or, Sins of the tongue
   complained of, namely, blasphemy, falshood, etc.


   Lord, if thou dost not soon appear,

   Virtue and truth will fly away;

   A faithful man amongst us here

   Will scarce be found, if thou delay.


   The whole discourse, when neighbors meet,

   Is filled with trifles loose and vain;

   Their lips are flattery and deceit,

   And their proud language is profane.


   But lips that with deceit abound

   Shall not maintain their triumph long;

   The God of vengeance will confound

   The flattering and blaspheming tongue.


   "Yet shall our words be free," they cry;

   "Our tongues shall be controlled by none:

   Where is the Lord will ask us why?

   Or say our lips are not our own?"


   The Lord, who sees the poor oppressed,

   And hears th' oppressor's haughty strain,

   Will rise to give his children rest,

   Nor shall they trust his word in vain.


   Thy word, O Lord, though often tried,

   Void of deceit shall still appear;

   Not silver, sev'n times purified

   From dross and mixture, shines so clear.


   Thy grace shall in the darkest hour

   Defend the holy soul from harm;

   Though when the vilest men have power,

   On every side will sinners swarm.

  PSALM 12

   C. M.

   Complaint of a general corruption of manners; or, The promise and sign
   of Christ's coming to judgment.

   PAUSE.


   Help, Lord, for men of virtue fail,

   Religion loses ground,

   The sons of violence prevail,

   And treacheries abound.


   Their oaths and promises they break,

   Yet act the flatterer's part;

   With fair, deceitful lips they speak,

   And with a double heart.


   If we reprove some hateful lie,

   How is their fury stirred

   "Are not our lips our own?" they cry;

   "And who shall be our Lord?"


   Scoffers appear on every side,

   Where a vile race of men

   Is raised to seats of power and pride,

   And bears the sword in vain.


   Lord, when iniquities abound,

   And blasphemy grows bold;

   When faith is hardly to be found,

   And love is waxing cold;


   Is not thy chariot hast'ning on?

   Hast thou not giv'n this sign?

   May we not trust and live upon

   A promise so divine?


   "Yes," saith the Lord, "now will I rise,

   And make oppressors flee;

   I shall appear to their surprise,

   And set my servants free."


   Thy word, like silver sev'n times tried,

   Through ages shall endure;

   The men that in thy truth confide

   Shall find the promise sure.

   L. M.

   Pleading with God under desertion; or, Hope in darkness.


   How long, O Lord, shall I complain,

   Like one that seeks his God in vain?

   Canst thou thy face for ever hide,

   And I still pray, and be denied?


   Shall I for ever be forgot,

   As one whom thou regardest not

   Still shall my soul thine absence mourn,

   And still despair of thy return?


   How long shall my poor troubled breast

   Be with these anxious thoughts oppressed?

   And Satan, my malicious foe,

   Rejoice to see me sunk so low?


   Hear, Lord, and grant me quick relief,

   Before my death conclude my grief:

   If thou withhold thy heav'nly light,

   I sleep in everlasting night.


   How will the powers of darkness boast,

   If but one praying soul be lost!

   But I have trusted in thy grace,

   And shall again behold thy face.


   Whate'er my fears or foes suggest,

   Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest;

   My heart shall feel thy love, and raise

   My cheerful voice to songs of praise.

   C. M.

   Complaint under temptations of the devil.


   How long wilt thou conceal thy face?

   My God, how long delay?

   When shall I feel those heav'nly rays

   That chase my fears away?


   How long shall my poor lab'ring soul

   Wrestle and toil in vain?

   Thy word can all my foes control,

   And ease my raging pain.


   See how the prince of darkness tries

   All his malicious arts

   He spreads a mist around my eyes,

   And throws his fiery darts.


   Be thou my sun, and thou my shield,

   My soul in safety keep;

   Make haste, before mine eyes are sealed

   In death's eternal sleep.


   How would the tempter boast aloud

   If I become his prey!

   Behold, the sons of hell grow proud

   At thy so long delay.


   But they shall fly at thy rebuke,

   And Satan hide his head;

   He knows the terrors of thy look,

   And hears thy voice with dread.


   Thou wilt display that sovereign grace,

   Where all my hopes have hung;

   I shall employ my lips in praise,

   And victory shall be sung.

  PSALM 14 PART 1

   C. M.

   By Nature all men are sinners.


   Fools in their heart believe and say

   "That all religion's vain;

   There is no God that reigns on high,

   Or minds th' affairs of men."


   From thoughts so dreadful and profane,

   Corrupt discourse proceeds;

   And in their impious hands are found

   Abominable deeds.


   The Lord from his celestial throne

   Looked down on things below,

   To find the man that sought his grace,

   Or did his justice know.


   By nature all are gone astray,

   Their practice all the same;

   There's none that fears his Maker's hand;

   There's none that loves his name.


   Their tongues are used to speak deceit,

   Their slanders never cease;

   How swift to mischief are their feet,

   Nor know the paths of peace!


   Such seeds of sin (that bitter root)

   In every heart are found;

   Nor can they bear diviner fruit,

   Till grace refine the ground.

  PSALM 14 PART 2

   C. M.

   The folly of persecutors.


   Are sinners now so senseless grown

   That they the saints devour?

   And never worship at thy throne,

   Nor fear thine awful power?


   Great God! appear to their surprise;

   Reveal thy dreadful name;

   Let them no more thy wrath despise,

   Nor turn our hope to shame.


   Dost thou not dwell among the just?

   And yet our foes deride,

   That we should make thy name our trust;

   Great God! confound their pride.


   O that the joyful day were come

   To finish our distress!

   When God shall bring his children home

   Our songs shall never cease.

   Who shall inhabit in thy hill,

   O God of holiness?

   Whom will the Lord admit to dwell

   So near his throne of grace?


   The man that walks in pious ways,

   And works with righteous hands;

   That trusts his Maker's promises,

   And follows his commands.


   He speaks the meaning of his heart,

   Nor slanders with his tongue;

   Will scarce believe an ill report,

   Nor do his neighbor wrong.


   The wealthy sinner he contemns,

   Loves all that fear the Lord;

   And though to his own hurt he swears,

   Still he performs his word.


   His hands disdain a golden bribe,

   And never gripe the poor:

   This man shall dwell with God on earth,

   And find his heav'n secure.

   Religion and justice, goodness and truth; or, Duties to God and man;

   Who shall ascend thy heav'nly place,

   Great God, and dwell before thy face?

   The man that minds religion now,

   And humbly walks with God below;


   Whose hands are pure, whose heart is clean,

   Whose lips still speak the thing they mean;

   No slanders dwell upon his tongue;

   He hates to do his neighbor wrong.


   [Scarce will he trust an ill report,

   Nor vents it to his neighbor's hurt:

   Sinners of state he can despise,

   But saints are honored in his eyes.]


   [Firm to his word he ever stood,

   And always makes his promise good;

   Nor dares to change the thing he swears,

   Whatever pain or loss he bears.]


   [He never deals in bribing gold,

   And mourns that justice should be sold;

   While others gripe and grind the poor,

   Sweet charity attends his door.]


   He loves his enemies, and prays

   For those that curse him to his face

   And doth to all men still the same

   That he would hope or wish from them.


   Yet, when his holiest works are done,

   His soul depends on grace alone:

   This is the man thy face shall see,

   And dwell for ever, Lord, with thee.

   Confession of our poverty, and saints the best company; or, Good works

   Preserve me, Lord, in time of need,

   For succor to thy throne I flee,

   But have no merits there to plead:

   My goodness cannot reach to thee.


   Oft have my heart and tongue confessed

   How empty and how poor I am;

   My praise can never make thee blessed,

   Nor add new glories to thy name.


   Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap

   Some profit by the good we do;

   These are the company I keep,

   These are the choicest friends I know.


   Let others choose the sons of mirth

   To give a relish to their wine;

   I love the men of heav'nly birth,

   Whose thoughts and language are divine.

   Christ's all-sufficiency.


   How fast their guilt and sorrows rise

   I will not taste their sacrifice,

   Their offerings of forbidden blood.


   My God provides a richer cup,

   And nobler food to live upon;

   He for my life has offered up

   Jesus, his best-beloved Son.


   His love is my perpetual feast;

   By day his counsels guide me right;

   And be his name for ever blessed,

   Who gives me sweet advice by night.


   I set him still before mine eyes;

   My dying flesh shall rest in hope.


   Though in the dust I lay my head,

   Yet, gracious God, thou wilt not leave

   My soul for ever with the dead,

   Nor lose thy children in the grave.


   My flesh shall thy first call obey,

   Shake off the dust, and rise on high;

   Then shalt thou lead the wondrous way

   Up to thy throne above the sky.


   There streams of endless pleasure flow;

   Can ne'er deserve thy grace.


   Yet if my God prolong my breath,

   The saints may profit by 't;

   The saints, the glory of the earth,

   The men of my delight.


   Let heathens to their idols haste,

   And worship wood or stone;

   But my delightful lot is cast

   Where the true God is known.


   His hand provides my constant food,

   He fills my daily cup;

   Much am I pleased with present good,

   But more rejoice in hope.


   God is my portion and my joy,

   His counsels are my light;

   He gives me sweet advice by day,

   And gentle hints by night.


   My soul would all her thoughts approve

   Behold, the sinner dies,

   His haughty words are vain;

   Here in this life his pleasure lies,

   And all beyond is pain.


   Then let his pride advance,

   And boast of all his store;

   The Lord is my inheritance,

   My soul can wish no more.


   I shall behold the face

   Of my forgiving God;

   And stand complete in righteousness,

   Washed in my Savior's blood.


   There's a new heav'n begun,

   They are the sword, the hand is thine.


   Their hope and portion lies below:

   'Tis all the happiness they know,

   'Tis all they seek; they take their shares,

   And leave the rest among their heirs.


   What sinners value I resign;

   Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine:

   I shall behold thy blissful face,

   And stand complete in righteousness.


   This life's a dream, an empty show;

   But the bright world to which I go

   Hath joys substantial and sincere:

   When shall I wake and find me there?


   O glorious hour! O blest abode!

   I shall be near and like my God!

   And flesh and sin no more control

   The sacred pleasures of the soul.


   My flesh shall slumber in the ground

   Till the last trumpet's joyful sound;

   Then burst the chains with sweet surprise,

   And in my Savior's image rise.

   Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength,

   My rock, my tower, my high defence:

   Thy mighty arm shall be my trust,

   For I have found salvation thence.


   Death, and the terrors of the grave,

   Stood round me with their dismal shade;

   While floods of high temptations rose,

   And made my sinking soul afraid.


   I saw the op'ning gates of hell,

   With endless pains and sorrows there,

   Which none but they that feel can tell;

   While I was hurried to despair.


   In my distress I called my God,

   When I could scarce believe him mine:

   He bowed his ear to my complaint,

   Then did his grace appear divine.


   With speed he flew to my relief,

   As on a cherub's wing he rode;

   Awful and bright as lightning shone

   The face of my deliverer, God.


   Temptations fled at his rebuke,

   The blast of his almighty breath;

   He sent salvation from on high,

   And drew me from the deeps of death.


   Great were my fears, my foes were great,

   Much was their strength, and more their rage;

   But Christ, my Lord, is conqueror still,

   In all the wars that devils wage.


   My song for ever shall record

   That terrible, that joyful hour;

   And give the glory to the Lord,

   Due to his mercy and his power

   Lord, thou hast seen my soul sincere,

   Hast made thy truth and love appear;

   Before mine eyes I set thy laws,

   And thou hast owned my righteous cause.


   Since I have learned thy holy ways,

   I've walked upright before thy face;

   Or if my feet did e'er depart,

   'Twas never with a wicked heart.


   What sore temptations broke my rest!

   What wars and strugglings in my breast!

   But through thy grace, that reigns within,

   I guard against my darling sin:


   That sin which close besets me still,

   That works and strives against my will:

   When shall thy Spirit's sovereign power

   Destroy it, that it rise no more?


   [With an impartial hand, the Lord

   Deals out to mortals their reward;

   The kind and faithful souls shall find

   A God as faithful and as kind.


   The just and pure shall ever say,

   Thou art more pure, more just than they;

   And men that love revenge shall know

   God hath an arm of vengeance too.]

   Gives me his holy sword to wield,

   Spreads his salvation for my shield.


   He lives, and blessed be my Rock!

   The God of my salvation lives:

   The dark designs of hell are broke;

   Sweet is the peace my Father gives.


   Before the scoffers of the age

   I will exalt my Father's name,

   Nor tremble at their mighty rage,

   But meet reproach, and bear the shame.


   To David and his royal seed

   His holy name our lips invoke,

   When God, our Leader, shines in arms,

   What mortal heart can bear

   The thunder of his loud alarms,

   The lightning of his spear?


   He rides upon the winged wind,

   And angels in array

   In millions wait to know his mind,

   And swift as flames obey.


   He speaks, and at his fierce rebuke

   Whole armies are dismayed;

   His voice, his frown, his angry look,

   Strikes all their courage dead.


   He forms our generals for the field,

   With all their dreadful skill;

   Gives them his awful sword to wield,

   And makes their hearts of steel.


   [He arms our captains to the fight,

   (Though there his name's forgot;

   He girded Cyrus with his might,

   'Tis by thine aid our troops prevail,

   And break united powers,

   How have we chased them through the field,

   And trod them to the ground,

   While thy salvation was our shield,

   But they no shelter found!


   In vain to idol saints they cry,

   PAUSE.


   Great God, the heav'ns' well-ordered frame

   Declares the glories of thy name:

   There thy rich works of wonder shine;

   A thousand starry beauties there,

   A thousand radiant marks appear

   Of boundless power and skill divine.


   From night to day, from day to night,

   The dawning and the dying light

   Lectures of heav'nly wisdom read;

   With silent eloquence they raise

   Our thoughts to our Creator's praise,

   And neither sound nor language need.


   Yet their divine instructions run

   Far as the journeys of the sun,

   And every nation knows their voice:

   The sun, like some young bridegroom dressed,

   Breaks from the chambers of the east,

   Rolls round, and makes the earth rejoice.


   Where'er he spreads his beams abroad,

   He smiles and speaks his Maker God

   All nature joins to show thy praise:

   Thus God in ev'ry creature shines;

   Fair is the book of nature's lines,

   But fairer is thy book of grace.


   I love the volumes of thy word;

   What light and joy those leaves afford

   To souls benighted and distressed!

   Thy precepts guide my doubtful way,

   Thy fear forbids my feet to stray,

   Thy promise leads my heart to rest.


   From the discoveries of thy law

   The perfect rules of life I draw;

   These are my study and delight:

   Not honey so invites the taste,

   Nor gold that hath the furnace past

   Appears so pleasing to the sight.


   Thy threat'nings wake my slumb'ring eyes,

   And warn me where my danger lies;

   But 'tis thy blessed gospel, Lord,

   That makes my guilty conscience clean,

   Converts my soul, subdues my sin,

   And gives a free, but large reward.


   Who knows the errors of his thoughts?

   My God, forgive my secret faults,

   And from presumptuous sins restrain:

   Accept my poor attempts of praise,

   That I have read thy book of grace,

   And book of nature, not in vain.

  PSALM 20

   L. M.

   Prayer and hope of victory.

   For a day of prayer in time of war.


   Now may the God of power and grace

   Attend his people's humble cry!

   Jehovah hears when Isr'el prays,

   And brings deliverance from on high.


   The name of Jacob's God defends

   Better than shields or brazen walls;

   He from his sanctuary sends

   Succor and strength, when Zion calls.


   Well he remembers all our sighs,

   His love exceeds our best deserts;

   His love accepts the sacrifice

   Of humble groans and broken hearts.


   In his salvation is our hope,

   And, in the name of Isr'el's God,

   Our troops shall lift their banners up,

   Our navies spread their flags abroad.


   Some trust in horses trained for war,

   And some of chariots make their boasts:

   Our surest expectations are

   From thee, the Lord of heav'nly hosts.


   [O may the memory of thy name

   Inspire our armies for the fight!

   Our foes shall fall and die with shame,

   Or quit the field with shameful flight.]


   Now save us, Lord, from slavish fear,

   Now let our hopes be firm and strong,

   Till the salvation shall appear,

   And joy and triumph raise the song.

   Our king is the care of Heaven.


   The king, O Lord, with songs of praise,

   Shall in thy strength rejoice;

   And, blest with thy salvation, raise

   To heav'n his cheerful voice.


   Thy sure defence through nations round

   Has spread his glorious name;

   And his successful actions crowned

   With majesty and fame.


   Then let the king on God alone

   For timely aid rely;

   His mercy shall support the throne,

   And all our wants supply.


   But, righteous Lord, his stubborn foes

   Shall feel thy dreadful hand;

   Thy vengeful arm shall find out those

   That hate his mild command.


   When thou against them dost engage,

   Thy just but dreadful doom

   Shall, like a fiery oven's rage,

   Their hopes and them consume.


   Thus, Lord, thy wondrous power declare,

   And thus exalt thy fame;

   Whilst we glad songs of praise prepare

   For thine almighty name.

   Christ exalted to the kingdom.


   David rejoiced in God his strength,

   Raised to the throne by special grace;

   But Christ the Son appears at length,

   Fulfils the triumph and the praise.


   How great is the Messiah's joy

   In the salvation of thy hand!

   Lord, thou hast raised his kingdom high,

   And giv'n the world to his command.


   Thy goodness grants whate'er he will,

   Nor doth the least request withhold;

   Blessings of love prevent him still,

   And crowns of glory, not of gold.


   Honor and majesty divine

   Around his sacred temples shine;

   Blest with the favor of thy face,

   And length of everlasting days.


   Thine hand shall find out all his foes;

   And as a fiery oven glows

   With raging heat and living coals,

   So shall thy wrath devour their souls.

   The sufferings and death of Christ.

   PAUSE.


   Why has my God my soul forsook,

   Nor will a smile afford?

   (Thus David once in anguish spoke,

   And thus our dying Lord.)


   Though 'tis thy chief delight to dwell

   Among thy praising saints,

   Yet thou canst hear a groan as well,

   And pity our complaints.


   Our fathers trusted in thy name,

   And great deliv'rance found;

   But I'm a worm, despised of men,

   And trodden to the ground.


   Shaking the head, they pass me by,

   And laugh my soul to scorn;

   "In vain he trusts in God," they cry,.

   "Neglected and forlorn."


   But thou art he who formed my flesh

   By thine almighty word;

   And since I hung upon the breast,

   My hope is in the Lord.


   Why will my Father hide his face,

   When foes stand threat'ning round,

   In the dark hour of deep distress,

   And not a helper found?


   Behold thy darling left among

   The cruel and the proud,

   As bulls of Bashan, fierce and strong,

   As lions roaring loud.


   From earth and hell my sorrows meet

   To multiply the smart;

   They nail my hands, they pierce my feet,

   And try to vex my heart.


   Yet if thy sovereign hand let loose

   The rage of earth and hell,

   Why will my heav'nly Father bruise

   The Son he loves so well?


   My God, if possible it be,

   Withhold this bitter cup

   But I resign my will to thee,

   And drink the sorrows up.


   My heart dissolves with pangs unknown,

   In groans I waste my breath;

   Thy heavy hand has brought me down

   Low as the dust of death.


   Father, I give my spirit up,

   And trust it in thy hand;

   My dying flesh shall rest in hope,

   And rise at thy command.

   Christ's sufferings and kingdom.


   "Now from the roaring lion's rage,

   O Lord, protect thy Son,

   Nor leave thy darling to engage

   The powers of hell alone."


   Thus did our suff'ring Savior pray,

   With mighty cries and tears;

   God heard him in that dreadful day,

   And chased away his fears.


   Great was the vict'ry of his death,

   His throne exalted high;

   And all the kindreds of the earth

   Shall worship or shall die.


   A num'rous offspring must arise

   From his expiring groans;

   They shall be reckoned in his eyes

   For daughters and for sons.


   The meek and humble souls shall see

   His table richly spread;

   And all that seek the Lord shall be

   With joys immortal fed.


   The isles shall know the righteousness

   Of our incarnate God,

   And nations yet unborn profess

   Salvation in his blood.

   Christ's sufferings and exaltation.


   Now let our mournful songs record

   The dying sorrows of our Lord,

   When he complained in tears and blood,

   As one forsaken of his God.


   The Jews beheld him thus forlorn,

   And shake their heads, and laugh in scorn:

   "He rescued others from the grave;

   Now let him try himself to save.


   "This is the man did once pretend

   God was his Father and his Friend;

   If God, the blessed, loved him so,

   Why doth he fail to help him now?"


   Barbarous people! cruel priests!

   How they stood round like savage beasts!

   Like lions gaping to devour,

   When God had left him in their power.


   They wound his head, his hands, his feet,

   Till streams of blood each other meet;

   By lot his garments they divide,

   And mock the pangs in which he died.


   But God, his Father, heard his cry;

   Raised from the dead, he reigns on high,

   The nations learn his righteousness,

   And humble sinners taste his grace.

   My Shepherd is the living Lord;

   Become my safety and my guide.


   In pastures where salvation grows

   He makes me feed, he makes me rest;

   There living water gently flows,

   And all the food's divinely blest.


   My wand'ring feet his ways mistake,

   But he restores my soul to peace,

   And leads me, for his mercy's sake,

   In the fair paths of righteousness.


   Though I walk through the gloomy vale

   Where death and all its terrors are,

   My heart and hope shall never fail,

   For God my Shepherd's with me there.


   Amidst the darkness and the deeps

   Thou art my comfort, thou my stay;

   Thy staff supports my feeble steps,

   Thy rod directs my doubtful way.


   The sons of earth, and sons of hell,

   Gaze at thy goodness, and repine

   To see my table spread so well

   With living bread and cheerful wine.


   How I rejoice when on my head

   Thy Spirit condescends to rest!

   'Tis a divine anointing, shed

   Like oil of gladness at a feast.


   Surely the mercies of the Lord

   Attend his household all their days;

   There will I dwell to hear his word,

   To seek his face, and sing his praise.

   In paths of truth and grace.


   When I walk through the shades of death,

   Thy presence is my stay;

   A word of thy supporting breath

   Drives all my fears away.


   Thy hand, in sight of all my foes,

   Doth still my table spread,

   My cup with blessings overflows,

   Thine oil anoints my head.


   The sure provisions of my God

   Attend me all my days:

   O may thy house be mine abode,

   And all my work be praise!


   There would I find a settled rest,

   While others go and come;

   No more a stranger or a guest,

   But like a child at home.

   Where living waters gently pass,

   And full salvation flows.


   If e'er I go astray,

   He doth my Soul reclaim;

   And guides me in his own right way,

   For his most holy name.


   While he affords his aid

   I cannot yield to fear;

   Though I should walk through death's dark shade,

   My Shepherd's with me there.


   In sight of all my foes,

   Thou dost my table spread;

   My cup with blessings overflows,

   And joy exalts my head.


   The bounties of thy love

   Shall crown my following days;

   Nor from thy house will I remove,

   This spacious earth is all the Lord's,

   He raised the building on the seas,

   And gave it for their dwelling-place.


   But there's a brighter world on high,

   Thy palace, Lord, above the sky:

   Who shall ascend that blest abode,

   And dwell so near his Maker God?


   He that abhors and fears to sin,

   Whose heart is pure, whose hands are clean,

   Him shall the Lord the Savior bless,

   And clothe his soul with righteousness.


   These are the men, the pious race,

   That seek the God of Jacob's face:

   These shall enjoy the blissful sight,

   And dwell in everlasting light.


   Rejoice, ye shining worlds on high,

   Behold the King of glory nigh!

   Who can this King of glory be?

   The mighty Lord, the Savior's he.


   Ye heav'nly gates, your leaves display,

   When shall the sovereign grace

   The tumult of my thoughts

   Doth but enlarge my woe;

   My spirit languishes, my heart

   Look on my anguish and my pain,

   Behold the hosts of hell,

   How cruel is their hate!

   Against my life they rise, and join

   O keep my soul from death,

   I hate to walk, I hate to sit,

   With men of vanity and lies

   The scoffer and the hypocrite

   Are the abhorrence of mine eyes.


   Amongst thy saints will I appear

   With frauds well washed in innocence;

   But when I stand before thy bar,

   The blood of Christ is my defence.


   I love thy habitation, Lord,

   The temple where thine honors dwell;

   There shall I hear thine holy word,

   And there thy works of wonder tell.

   God of my life, I fly to thee

   In a distressing day.


   Should friends and kindred near and dear

   Leave me to want or die,

   My God would make my life his care,

   And all my need supply.


   My fainting flesh had died with grief

   Had not my soul believed,

   "Hear me, O God of grace," I said,

   "And bring me from among the dead:"

   Thy word rebuked the pains I felt,

   Thy pard'ning love removed my guilt.


   My groans, and tears, and forms of woe

   Are turned to joy and praises now;

   I throw my sackcloth on the ground,

   And ease and gladness gird me round


   My tongue, the glory of my frame,

   "My life is spent with grief," I cried,

   "My years consumed in groans,

   While to my neighbors I became

   And speedy rescue found.


   How great deliverance thou hast wrought

   The lying lips to silence brought,

   And made their boastings vain!


   Thy children from the strife of tongues

   Shall thy pavilion hide;

   Guard them from infamy and wrongs,

   What agonies of inward smart!


   I spread my sins before the Lord,

   And all my secret faults confess;

   Thy gospel speaks a pard'ning word,

   Thine Holy Spirit seals the grace.


   For this shall every humble soul

   Make swift addresses to thy seat;

   When floods of huge temptations roll,

   There shall they find a bless'd retreat.


   How safe beneath thy wings I lie,

   Let heav'n and earth proclaim;

   His works of nature and of grace

   Reveal his wondrous name.


   His wisdom and almighty word

   The heav'nly arches spread,

   And by the Spirit of the Lord

   Their shining hosts were made.


   He bid the liquid waters flow

   To their appointed deep;

   The flowing seas their limits know,

   And their own station keep).


   Ye tenants of the spacious earth,

   With fear before him stand

   He spake, and nature took its birth,

   And rests on his command.


   He scorns the angry nations' rage,

   Does the whole world behold;

   He formed us all of equal clay,

   And knows our feeble mold.


   Kings are not rescued by the force

   Of armies from the grave;

   Nor speed nor courage of a horse

   Vain is the strength of beasts or men,

   To hope for safety thence;

   But holy souls from God obtain

   A strong and sure defence.


   God is their fear, and God their trust;

   When plagues or famine spread,

   His watchful eye secures the just

   Sing of his name, his word, his ways,

   His works of nature and of grace,

   How wise and holy, just and true!


   Justice and truth he ever loves,

   And the whole earth his goodness proves,

   His word the heav'nly arches spread:

   And by the spirit of his mouth

   Were all the starry armies made.


   He gathers the wide-flowing seas

   (Those wat'ry treasures know their place)

   In the vast storehouse of the deep:

   He spake, and gave all nature birth;

   And fires, and seas, and heav'n, and earth,

   His everlasting orders keep.


   Let mortals tremble and adore

   A God of such resistless power,

   Nor dare indulge their feeble rage:

   Let kings rely upon their host,

   And of his strength the champion boast;

   In vain they boast, in vain rely;

   In vain we trust the brutal force,

   Or speed, or courage, of a horse,

   To guard his rider or to fly.


   The eye of thy compassion, Lord,

   [O sinners, come and taste his love,

   They toil for heirs, they know not who,

   And straight are seen no more.


   What should I wish or wait for, then,

   From creatures earth and dust?

   They make our expectations vain,

   And disappoint our trust.

   My strength consumes, my spirit dies,

   Through thy repeated strokes.


   Crushed as a moth beneath thy hand,

   We moulder to the dust;

   I'm but a sojourner below,

   As all my fathers were;

   May I be well prepared to go,

   When I the summons hear.

   Deep bonds of miry clay.


   Firm on a rock he made me stand,

   And taught my cheerful tongue

   To praise the wonders of his hand,

   In a new thankful song.


   I'll spread his works of grace abroad;

   The saints with joy shall hear,

   Their only hope and fear.


   How many are thy thoughts of love!

   Was made a sacrifice.


   No blood of beasts on altars shed

   Could wash the conscience clean;

   But the rich sacrifice he paid

   Atones for all our sin.


   Then was the great salvation spread,

   And Satan's kingdom shook;

   Thus by the woman's promised seed

   The serpent's head was broke.

  PSALM 40

   v.5-10

   L. M.

   Christ our sacrifice.


   The wonders, Lord, thy love has wrought,

   Exceed our praise, surmount our thought;

   Should I attempt the long detail,

   My speech would faint, my numbers fail,


   No blood of beasts on altars spilt

   Can cleanse the souls of men from guilt;

   But thou hast set before our eyes

   An all-sufficient sacrifice.


   Lo! thine eternal Son appears,

   To thy designs he bows his ears,

   Assumes a body well prepared,

   And well performs a work so hard.


   "Behold, I come," the Savior cries,

   With love and duty in his eyes,

   "I come to bear the heavy load

   Of sins, and do thy will, my God.


   "'Tis written in thy great decree,

   'Tis in thy book foretold of me,

   I must fulfil the Savior's part;

   And lo! thy law is in my heart!


   "I'll magnify thy holy law,

   And rebels to obedience draw,

   When on my cross I'm lifted high,

   Or to my crown above the sky.


   "The Spirit shall descend and show

   What thou hast done, and what I do

   The wond'ring world shall learn thy grace,

   Thy wisdom, and thy righteousness."

   L. M.

   Charity to the poor; or, Pity to the afflicted.


   Blest is the man whose bowels move,

   And melt with pity to the poor;

   Whose soul, by sympathizing love,

   Feels what his fellow saints endure.


   His heart contrives for their relief

   More good than his own hands can do;

   He, in the time of gen'ral grief,

   Shall find the Lord has bowels too.


   His soul shall live secure on earth,

   With secret blessings on his head,

   When drought, and pestilence, and dearth

   Around him multiply their dead.


   Or if he languish on his couch,

   God will pronounce his sins forgiv'n;

   Will save him with a healing touch,

   Or take his willing soul to heav'n.

   C. M.

   Desertion and hope; or, Complaint of absence from public worship.


   With earnest longings of the mind,

   My God, to thee I look;

   So pants the hunted hart to find

   And taste the cooling brook.


   When shall I see thy courts of grace,

   And meet my God again?

   So long an absence from thy face

   My heart endures with pain.


   Temptations vex my weary soul,

   And tears are my repast;

   The foe insults without control,

   "And where's your God at last?"


   'Tis with a mournful pleasure now

   I think on ancient days;

   Then to thy house did numbers go,

   And all our work was praise.


   But why, my soul, sunk down so far

   Beneath this heavy load?

   Why do my thoughts indulge despair,

   And sin against my God?


   Hope in the Lord, whose mighty hand

   Can all thy woes remove,

   For I shall yet before him stand,

   And sing restoring love.

   My spirit sinks within me, Lord,

   But I will call thy name to mind,

   And times of past distress record,

   When I have found my God was kind.


   Huge troubles with tumultuous noise

   Swell like a sea, and round me spread;

   Thy water-spouts drown all my joys,

   And rising waves roll o'er my head.


   Yet will the Lord command his love,

   When I address his throne by day,

   Nor in the night his grace remove;

   The night shall hear me sing and pray.


   I'll cast myself before his feet,

   And say, "My God, my heav'nly rock,

   Why doth thy love so long forget

   The soul that groans beneath thy stroke?"


   I'll chide my heart that sinks so low,

   Why should my soul indulge her grief?

   Hope in the Lord, and praise him too;

   He is my rest, my sure relief.


   Thy light and truth shall guide me still,

   Thy word shall my best thoughts employ,

   And lead me to thine heav'nly hill,

   My God, my most exceeding joy.

   The church's complaint in persecution.

   PAUSE.


   Lord, we have heard thy works of old,

   Thy works of power and grace,

   When to our ears our fathers told

   The wonders of their days.


   How thou didst build thy churches here,

   And make thy gospel known;

   Amongst them did thine arm appear,

   Thy light and glory shone.


   In God they boasted all the day,

   And in a cheerful throng

   Did thousands meet to praise and pray,

   And grace was all their song.


   But now our souls are seized with shame,

   Confusion fills our face,

   To hear the enemy blaspheme,

   And fools reproach thy grace.


   Yet have we not forgot our God,

   Nor falsely dealt with heav'n,

   Nor have our steps declined the road

   Of duty thou hast giv'n;


   Though dragons all around us roar

   With their destructive breath,

   And thine own hand has bruised us sore

   Hard by the gates of death.


   We are exposed all day to die

   As martyrs for thy cause,

   As sheep for slaughter bound we lie

   By sharp and bloody laws.


   Awake, arise, Almighty Lord,

   Why sleeps thy wonted grace?

   Why should we look like men abhorred

   Or banished from thy face?


   Wilt thou for ever cast us off,

   And still neglect our cries?

   For ever hide thine heav'nly love

   From our afflicted eyes?


   Down to the dust our soul is bowed,

   And dies upon the ground;

   Rise for our help, rebuke the proud,

   And all their powers confound.


   Redeem us from perpetual shame,

   Our Savior and our God;

   We plead the honors of thy name,

   The merits of thy blood.

   Gird on thy sword, victorious Prince,

   Ride with majestic sway;

   And make the world obey.


   Thy throne, O God, for ever stands;

   Thy word of grace shall prove

   A peaceful sceptre in thy hands,

   To rule the saints by love.

   Dress thee in arms, most mighty Lord,

   Gird on the terror of thy sword,

   With truth and meekness at thy side.


   Thine anger, like a pointed dart,

   Fair stranger, let thine heart forget

   The idols of thy native state.


   So shall the King the more rejoice

   In thee, the favorite of his choice;

   Let him be loved, and yet adored,

   O happy hour, when thou shalt rise

   To his fair palace in the skies,

   And all thy sons (a numerous train)

   There is a stream, whose gentle flow

   Supplies the city of our God;

   From sea to sea, through all the shores,

   He makes the noise of battle cease;

   When from on high his thunder roars,

   He awes the trembling world to peace.


   He breaks the bow, he cuts the spear

   Chariots he burns with heav'nly flame;

   Keep silence, all the earth, and hear

   The sound and glory of his name.


   "Be still, and learn that I am God;

   When kings against her joined,

   And saw the Lord was there,

   In wild confusion of the mind

   They fled with hasty fear.


   When navies tall and proud

   Attempt to spoil our peace,

   He sends his tempests roaring loud,

   And sinks them in the seas.


   Oft have our fathers told,

   Our eyes have often seen,

   How well our God secures the fold

   Pride and death; or, The vanity of life and riches.

   PAUSE.


   Why doth the man of riches grow

   To insolence and pride,

   To see his wealth and honors flow

   With every rising tide?


   [Why doth he treat the poor with scorn,

   Made of the self-same clay,

   And boast as though his flesh was born

   Of better dust than they?]


   Not all his treasures can procure

   His soul a short reprieve,

   Redeem from death one guilty hour,

   Or make his brother live.


   [Life is a blessing can't be sold,

   The ransom is too high;

   Justice will ne'er be bribed with gold,

   That man may never die.]


   He sees the brutish and the wise,

   The tim'rous and the brave,

   Quit their possessions, close their eyes,

   And hasten to the grave.


   Yet 'tis his inward thought and pride,-

   My house shall ever stand

   And that my name may long abide,

   I'll give it to my land."


   Vain are his thoughts, his hopes are lost,

   How soon his memory dies!

   His name is written in the dust

   Where his own carcass lies.


   This is the folly of their way;

   And yet their sons, as vain,

   Approve the words their fathers say,

   And act their works again.


   Men void of wisdom and of grace,

   If honor raise them high,

   Live like the beast, a thoughtless race,

   And like the beast they die.

   When will that hour appear?

   When shall the just revive, and reign

   With all the wealth in which they trust;

   Nor give a dying brother breath,

   When God commands him down to dust.


   There the dark earth and dismal shade

   Shall clasp their naked bodies round;

   That flesh, so delicately fed,

   Lies cold and moulders in the ground.


   Like thoughtless sheep the sinner dies,

   Laid in the grave for worms to eat:

   The saints shall in the morning rise,

   And find th' oppressor at their feet.


   His honors perish in the dust,

   And pomp and beauty, birth and blood:

   That glorious day exalts the just

   To full dominion o'er the proud.

   They take his cov'nant on their tongue,

   But break his laws, abuse his grace.


   To heav'n they lift their hands unclean,

   Defiled with lust, defiled with blood;

   By night they practise every sin,

   By day their mouths draw near to God.


   And while his judgments long delay,

   They grow secure and sin the more;

   They think he sleeps as well as they,

   And put far off the dreadful hour.

   "Not for the want of goats or bullocks slain

   Without the flames of love; in vain the store

   Of brutal off'rings that were mine before;

   Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed,

   Flocks, herds, and fields and forests where they feed.


   "If I were hungry, would I ask thee food?

   When did I thirst, or drink thy bullocks' blood?

   Can I be flattered with thy cringing bows,

   Are my eyes charmed thy vestments to behold,

   Glaring in gems, and gay in woven gold?

   And cherish such an impious thought within,

   That God, the Righteous, would indulge thy sin?

   Behold my terrors now: my thunders roll,

   And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul."


   Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise;

   Awake before this dreadful morning rise;

   Change your vain thoughts, your crooked works amend,

   Through distant worlds and regions of the dead:

   The trumpet sounds; hell trembles; heav'n rejoices

   Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices.


   No more shall atheists mock his long delay;

   His vengeance sleeps no more; behold the day:

   Behold, the Judge descends; his guards are nigh;

   Tempests and fire attend him down the sky.

   When God appears, all nature shall adore him;

   While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him.


   "Heav'n, earth, and hell, draw near; let all things come

   To hear my justice, and the sinner's doom;

   But gather first my saints," the Judge commands,

   "Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands."

   When Christ returns, wake every cheerful passion

   And shout, ye saints; he comes for your salvation.


   "Behold, my cov'nant stands for ever good,

   Sealed by th' eternal Sacrifice in blood,

   And signed with all their names; the Greek, the Jew,

   That paid the ancient worship or the new."

   There's no distinction here; join all your voices,

   And raise your heads, ye saints, for heav'n rejoices.


   "Here," saith the Lord, "ye angels, spread their thrones

   And near me seat my fav'rites and my sons:

   Come, my redeemed, possess the joys prepared

   Ere time began; 'tis your divine reward."

   When Christ returns, wake every cheerful passion;

   And shout, ye saints; he comes for your salvation


   "I am the Savior, I th' Almighty God,

   I am the Judge: ye heav'ns, proclaim abroad

   My just eternal sentence, and declare

   Those awful truths that sinners dread to hear."

   When God appears, all nature shall adore him;

   While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him.


   "Stand forth, thou bold blasphemer, and profane,

   Now feel my wrath, nor call my threat'nings vain:

   Thou hypocrite, once dressed in saints' attire,

   I doom the painted hypocrite to fire."

   Judgment proceeds; hell trembles; heav'n rejoices;

   Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices.


   "Not for the want of goats or bullocks slain

   Do I condemn thee; bulls and goats are vain

   Without the flame of love; in vain the store

   Of brutal off'rings, that were mine before."

   Earth is the Lord's, all nature shall adore him;

   While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him.


   "If I were hungry, would I ask thee food?

   When did I thirst, or drink thy bullocks' blood?

   Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed,

   Flocks, herds, and fields and forests where they feed."

   All is the Lord's, he rules the wide creation;

   Gives sinners vengeance, and the saints salvation.


   "Can I be flatter'd with thy cringing bows,

   Thy solemn chatt'rings and fantastic vows?

   Are my eyes charmed thy vestments to behold,

   Glaring in gems, and gay in woven gold?"

   God is the Judge of hearts, no fair disguises

   Can screen the guilty when his vengeance rises.


   "Unthinking wretch! how couldst thou hope to please

   A God, a Spirit, with such toys as these,

   While, with my grace and statutes on thy tongue,

   Thou lov'st deceit, and dost thy brother wrong?"

   Judgment proceeds; hell trembles; heav'n rejoices;

   Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices.


   "In vain to pious forms thy zeal pretends;

   Thieves and adulterers are thy chosen friends;

   While the false flatt'rer at my altar waits,

   His hardened soul divine instruction hates."

   God is the Judge of hearts, no fair disguises

   Can screen the guilty when his vengeance rises.


   "Silent I waited with long-suff'ring love;

   But didst thou hope that I should ne'er reprove?

   And cherish such an impious thought within,

   That the All-Holy would indulge thy sin?"

   See, God appears; all nature joins t' adore him;

   Judgment proceeds, and sinners fall before him.


   "Behold my terrors now; my thunders roll,

   And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul;

   Now like a lion shall my vengeance tear

   Thy bleeding heart, and no deliv'rer near."

   Judgment concludes; hell trembles; heav'n rejoices;

   Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices.


   Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise;

   Awake before this dreadful morning rise;

   Change your vain thoughts, your crooked works amend,

   Fly to the Savior, make the Judge your friend:

   Then join the saints, wake every cheerful passion;

   When Christ returns, he comes for your salvation.

  PSALM 51 PART 1

   L. M.

   A penitent pleading for pardon.


   Show pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive,

   Let a repenting rebel live:

   Are not thy mercies large and free?

   May not a sinner trust in thee?


   My crimes are great, but not surpass

   The power and glory of thy grace:

   Great God, thy nature hath no bound,

   So let thy pard'ning love be found.


   O wash my soul from every sin,

   And make my guilty conscience clean;

   Here on my heart the burden lies,

   And past offences pain my eyes.


   My lips with shame my sins confess

   Against thy law, against thy grace:

   Lord, should thy judgment grow severe,

   I am condemned, but thou art clear.


   Should sudden vengeance seize my breath,

   I must pronounce thee just in death;

   And if my soul were sent to hell,

   Thy righteous law approves it well.


   Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,

   Whose hope, still hov'ring round thy word,

   Would light on some sweet promise there,

   Some sure support against despair.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 51 PART 2

   L. M.

   Original and actual sin confessed.


   Lord, I am vile, conceived in sin;

   And born unholy and unclean;

   Sprung from the man whose guilty fall

   Corrupts the race, and taints us all.


   Soon as we draw our infant breath,

   The seeds of sin grow up for death;

   Thy law demands a perfect heart,

   But we're defiled in every part.


   [Great God, create my heart anew,

   And form my spirit pure and true;

   O make me wise betimes to spy

   My danger and my remedy.]


   Behold, I fall before thy face;

   My only refuge is thy grace:

   No outward forms can make me clean

   The leprosy lies deep within.


   No bleeding bird, nor bleeding beast,

   Nor hyssop branch, nor sprinkling priest,

   Nor running brook, nor flood, nor sea,

   Can wash the dismal stain away.


   Jesus, my God, thy blood alone

   Hath power sufficient to atone;

   Thy blood can make me white as snow;

   No Jewish types could cleanse me so.


   While guilt disturbs and breaks my peace,

   Nor flesh nor soul hath rest or ease;

   Lord, let me hear thy pard'ning voice,

   And make my broken bones rejoice.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 51 PART 3

   L. M.

   The backslider restored.


   O Thou that hear'st when sinners cry,

   Though all my crimes before thee lie,

   Behold them not with angry look,

   But blot their mem'ry from thy book.


   Create my nature pure within,

   And form my soul averse to sin:

   Let thy good Spirit ne'er depart,

   Nor hide thy presence from my heart.


   I cannot live without thy light

   Cast out and banished from thy sight:

   Thine holy joys, my God, restore,

   And guard me that I fall no more.


   Though I have grieved thy Spirit, Lord,

   His help and comfort still afford;

   And let a wretch come near thy throne,

   To plead the merits of thy Son.


   A broken heart, my God, my King,

   Is all the sacrifice I bring;

   The God of grace will ne'er despise

   A broken heart for sacrifice.


   My soul lies humbled in the dust,

   And owns thy dreadful sentence just:

   Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye,

   And save the soul condemned to die.


   Then will I teach the world thy ways;

   Sinners shall learn thy sovereign grace;

   I'll lead them to my Savior's blood,

   And they shall praise a pard'ning God.


   O may thy love inspire my tongue!

   Salvation shall be all my song;

   And all my powers shall join to bless

   The Lord, my strength and righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 51 PART 1

   v.3-13

   C. M.

   Original and actual sin confessed and pardoned.


   Lord, I would spread my sore distress

   And guilt before thine eyes;

   Against thy laws, against thy grace,

   How high my crimes arise!


   Shouldst thou condemn my soul to hell,

   And crush my flesh to dust,

   Heav'n would approve thy vengeance well,

   And earth must own it just.


   I from the stock of Adam came,

   Unholy and unclean;

   All my original is shame,

   And all my nature sin.


   Born in a world of guilt, I drew

   Contagion with my breath;

   And as my days advanced, I grew

   A juster prey for death.


   Cleanse me, O Lord, and cheer my soul

   With thy forgiving love;

   O make my broken spirit whole,

   And bid my pains remove.


   Let not thy Spirit quite depart,

   Nor drive me from thy face;

   Create anew my vicious heart,

   And fill it with thy grace.


   Then will I make thy mercy known

   Before the sons of men;

   Backsliders shall address thy throne,

   And turn to God again.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Repentance and faith in the blood of Christ.


   O God of mercy, hear my call,

   Break down this separating wall,

   That bars me from my love.


   Give me the presence of thy grace,

   Then my rejoicing tongue

   Shall speak aloud thy righteousness,

   And make thy praise my song.


   No blood of goats nor heifers slain,

   For sin could e'er atone;

   The death of Christ shall still remain

   Sufficient and alone.


   A soul oppressed with sin's desert,

   My God will ne'er despise;

   A humble groan, a broken heart,

   Is our best sacrifice.

   Victory and deliverance from persecution.


   Are all the foes of Zion fools,

   Who thus devour her saints?

   Do they not know her Savior rules,

   And pities her complaints?


   They shall be seized with sad surprise;

   For God's revenging arm

   Scatters the bones of them that rise

   To do his children harm.


   In vain the sons of Satan boast

   Of armies in array;

   When God has first despised their host

   They fall an easy prey.


   O for a word from Zion's King,

   Her captives to restore!

   Jacob with all his tribes shall sing,

   And Judah weep no more.

   Support for the afflicted and tempted soul.

   PAUSE.


   O God, my refuge, hear my cries,

   "Behold my flowing tears;

   For earth and hell my hurt devise,

   And triumph in my fears.


   Their rage is leveled at my life,

   My soul with guilt they load,

   And fill my thoughts with inward strife,

   To shake my hope in God.


   With inward pain my heart-strings sound,

   I groan with ev'ry breath;

   Horror and fear beset me round

   Amongst the shades of death.


   O were I like a feathered dove,

   And innocence had wings,

   I'd fly, and make a long remove

   From all these restless things.


   Let me to some wild desert go,

   And find a peaceful home;

   Where storms of malice never blow,

   Temptations never come.


   Vain hopes, and vain inventions all

   To 'scape the rage of hell!

   The mighty God on whom I call,

   Can save me here as well.


   By morning light I'll seek his face,

   At noon repeat my cry;

   The night shall hear me ask his grace,

   Nor will he long deny.


   God shall preserve my soul from fear,

   Or shield me when afraid;

   Ten thousand angels must appear,

   If he command their aid.


   I cast my burdens on the Lord,

   The Lord sustains them all;

   My courage rests upon his word,

   That saints shall never fall.


   My highest hopes shall not be vain,

   My lips shall spread his praise;

   While cruel and deceitful men

   Scarce live out half their days.

   Dangerous prosperity; or, Daily devotions encouraged


   Let sinners take their course,

   And choose the road to death

   But in the worship of my God

   I'll spend my daily breath.


   My thoughts address his throne

   When morning brings the light;

   I'll seek his blessing every noon,

   And pay my vows at night.


   Thou wilt regard my cries,

   O my eternal God,

   While sinners perish in surprise,

   Beneath thine angry rod.


   Because they dwell at ease,

   And no sad changes feel,

   They neither fear nor trust thy name,

   Nor learn to do thy will.


   But I with all my cares

   Will lean upon the Lord;

   I'll cast my burdens on his arm,

   And rest upon his word.


   His arm shall well sustain

   The children of his love;

   The ground on which their safety stands,

   No earthly power can move.

   Deliverance from oppression and falsehood.

   PAUSE.


   O Thou whose justice reigns on high,

   And makes th' oppressor cease,

   Behold how envious sinners try

   To vex and break my peace.


   The sons of violence and lies

   Join to devour me, Lord;

   But as my hourly dangers rise,

   My refuge is thy word.


   In God most holy, just, and true,

   I have reposed my trust;

   Nor will I fear what flesh can do,

   The offspring of the dust.


   They wrest my words to mischief still,

   Charge me with unknown faults;

   Mischief doth all their counsels fill,

   And malice all their thoughts.


   Shall they escape without thy frown?

   Must their devices stand?

   O cast the haughty sinner down,

   And let him know thy hand.


   God counts the sorrows of his saints,

   Their groans affect his ears;

   Thou hast a book for my complaints,

   A bottle for my tears.


   When to thy throne I raise my cry,

   The wicked fear and flee;

   So swift is prayer to reach the sky,

   So near is God to me.


   In thee, most holy, just, and true,

   I have reposed my trust;

   Nor will I fear what man can do,

   The offspring of the dust.


   Thy solemn vows are on me, Lord,

   Thou shalt receive my praise;

   I'll sing, "How faithful is thy word,

   How righteous all thy ways!"


   Thou hast secured my soul from death,

   O set thy pris'ner free!

   That heart and hand, and life and breath,

   May be employ'd for thee.

   Praise for protection, grace, and truth.


   My God, in whom are all the springs

   Of boundless love, and grace unknown,

   Hide me beneath thy spreading wings,

   Till the dark cloud is overblown.


   Up to the heav'ns I send my cry,

   The Lord will my desires perform;

   He sends his angel from the sky,

   And saves me from the threat'ning storm.


   Be thou exalted, O my God,

   Above the heav'ns, where angels dwell;

   Thy power on earth be known abroad,

   And land to land thy wonders tell.


   My heart is fixed; my song shall raise

   Immortal honors to thy name;

   Awake, my tongue, to sound his praise,

   My tongue, the glory of my frame.


   High o'er the earth his mercy reigns,

   And reaches to the utmost sky;

   His truth to endless years remains,

   When lower worlds dissolve and die.


   Be thou exalted, O my God,

   Above the heav'ns, where angels dwell;

   Thy power on earth be known abroad,

   And land to land thy wonders tell.

  PSALM 58

   8,8,8,8,8,8

   Warning to magistrates.


   Judges, who rule the world by laws,

   Will ye despise the righteous cause,

   When th' injured poor before you stands?

   Dare ye condemn the righteous poor,

   And let rich sinners 'scape secure,

   While gold and greatness bribe your hands?


   Have ye forgot, or never knew,

   That God will judge the judges too?

   High in the heav'ns his justice reigns;

   Yet you invade the rights of God,

   And send your bold decrees abroad,

   To bind the conscience in your chains.


   A poisoned arrow is your tongue,

   The arrow sharp, the poison strong,

   And death attends where'er it wounds:

   You hear no counsels, cries, or tears;

   So the deaf adder stops her ears

   Against the power of charming sounds.


   Break out their teeth, eternal God,

   Those teeth of lions dyed in blood;

   And crush the serpents in the dust:

   As empty chaff when whirlwinds rise

   Before the sweeping tempest flies,

   So let their hopes and names be lost.


   Th' Almighty thunders from the sky,

   Their grandeur melts, their titles die,

   As hills of snow dissolve and run,

   Or snails that perish in their slime,

   Or births that come before their time,

   Vain births, that never see the sun.


   Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord

   Safety and joy to saints afford;

   And all that hear shall join and say,

   "Sure there's a God that rules on high,

   A God that hears his children cry,

   And will their suff'rings well repay."

   C. M.

   On a day of humiliation for disappointments in war.


   Lord, hast thou cast the nation off?

   Must we for ever mourn?

   Wilt thou indulge immortal wrath?

   Shall mercy ne'er return?


   The terror of one frown of thine

   Melts all our strength away;

   Like men that totter drunk with wine,

   We tremble in dismay.


   Great Britain shakes beneath thy stroke

   And dreads thy threat'ning hand;

   O heal the island thou hast broke,

   Confirm the wav'ring land.


   Lift up a banner in the field

   For those that fear thy name;

   Save thy beloved with thy shield,

   And put our foes to shame.


   Go with our armies to the fight,

   Like a confed'rate God;

   In vain confed'rate powers unite

   Against thy lifted rod.


   Our troops shall gain a wide renown

   By thine assisting hand

   'Tis God that treads the mighty down,

   And makes the feeble stand.

   S. M.

   Safety in God.


   When, overwhelm'd with grief,

   My heart within me dies,

   Helpless, and far from all relief,

   To heav'n I lift mine eyes.


   O lead me to the rock

   That's high above my head,

   And make the covert of thy wings

   My shelter and my shade.


   Within thy presence, Lord,

   For ever I'll abide;

   Thou art the tower of my defence,

   The refuge where I hide.


   Thou givest me the lot

   Of those that fear thy name;

   If endless life be their reward,

   I shall possess the same.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 62

   v.5-12

   L. M.

   No trust in the creatures; or, Faith in Divine grace and power.


   My spirit looks to God alone;

   My rock and refuge is his throne;

   In all my fears, in all my straits,

   My soul on his salvation waits.


   Trust him, ye saints, in all your ways,

   Pour out your hearts before his face:

   When helpers fail, and foes invade,

   God is our all-sufficient aid.


   False are the men of high degree,

   The baser sort are vanity;

   Laid in the balance, both appear

   Light as a puff of empty air.


   Make not increasing gold your trust,

   Nor set your hearts on glitt'ring dust

   Why will you grasp the fleeting smoke,

   And not believe what God has spoke?


   Once has his awful voice declared,

   Once and again my ears have heard,

   "All power is his eternal due;

   He must be feared and trusted too."


   For sovereign power reigns not alone,

   Grace is a partner of the throne:

   Thy grace and justice, mighty Lord,

   Shall well divide our last reward.

   The morning of a Lord's day.


   Early, my God, without delay,

   I haste to seek thy face;

   My thirsty spirit faints away

   Without thy cheering grace.


   So pilgrims on the scorching sand,

   Beneath a burning sky,

   Long for a cooling stream at hand,

   And they must drink or die.


   I've seen thy glory and thy power

   Through all thy temple shine;

   My God, repeat that heav'nly hour,

   That vision so divine.


   Not all the blessings of a feast

   Can please my soul so well,

   As when thy richer grace I taste,

   And in thy presence dwell.


   Not life itself, with all her joys,

   Can my best passions move,

   Or raise so high my cheerful voice,

   As thy forgiving love.


   Thus till my last expiring day

   I'll bless my God and King;

   Thus will I lift my hands to pray,

   And tune my lips to sing.

   C. M.

   Midnight thoughts recollected.


   'Twas in the watches of the night

   I thought upon thy power,

   I kept thy lovely face in sight

   Amidst the darkest hour.


   My flesh lay resting on my bed,

   My soul arose on high:

   "My God, my life, my hope," I said,

   "Bring thy salvation nigh."


   My spirit labors up thine hill,

   And climbs the heav'nly road;

   But thy right hand upholds me still,

   While I pursue my God.


   Thy mercy stretches o'er my head

   The shadow of thy wings;

   My heart rejoices in thine aid,

   My tongue awakes and sings.


   But the destroyers of my peace

   Shall fret and rage in vain;

   The tempter shall for ever cease,

   And all my sins be slain.


   Thy sword shall give my foes to death,

   And send them down to dwell

   In the dark caverns of the earth,

   Or to the deeps of hell.

   Longing after God; or, The love of God better than life.


   Great God, indulge my humble claim,

   Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest;

   The glories that compose thy name

   Stand all engaged to make me blest.


   Thou great and good, thou just and wise,

   Thou art my Father and my God;

   And I am thine by sacred ties;

   Thy son, thy servant, bought with blood


   With heart, and eyes, and lifted hands,

   For thee I long, to thee I look,

   As travellers in thirsty lands

   Pant for the cooling water-brook.


   With early feet I love t' appear

   Among thy saints, and seek thy face;

   Oft have I seen thy glory there,

   And felt the power of sovereign grace.


   Not fruits nor wines that tempt our taste,

   Nor all the joys our senses know,

   Could make me so divinely blest,

   Or raise my cheerful passions so.


   My life itself without thy love

   No taste of pleasure could afford;

   'Twould but a tiresome burden prove,

   If I were banish'd from the Lord.


   Amidst the wakeful hours of night,

   When busy cares afflict my head,

   One thought of thee gives new delight,

   And adds refreshment to my bed.


   I'll lift my hands, I'll raise my voice,

   While I have breath to pray or praise;

   This work shall make my heart rejoice,

   And spend the remnant of my days.

   My thirsty, fainting soul

   Thy mercy doth implore;

   Not travellers in desert lands

   Can pant for water more.


   Within thy churches, Lord,

   I long to find my place;

   Thy power and glory to behold,

   And feel thy quick'ning grace.


   For life without thy love

   No relish can afford;

   No joy can be compared to this,

   To serve and please the Lord.


   To thee I'll lift my hands,

   And praise thee while I live;

   Not the rich dainties of a feast

   Such food or pleasure give.


   In wakeful hours at night

   I call my God to mind;

   I think how wise thy counsels are,

   And all thy dealings kind.


   Since thou hast been my help,

   To thee my spirit flies,

   And on thy watchful providence

   My cheerful hope relies.


   The shadow of thy wings

   O thou whose mercy bends the skies

   To save when humble sinners pray,

   All lands to thee shall lift their eyes,

   And islands of the northern sea.


   Against my will my sins prevail,

   But grace shall purge away their stain;

   The blood of Christ will never fail

   To wash my garments white again.


   Blest is the man whom thou shalt choose,

   And give him kind access to thee;

   Give him a place within thy house,

   To taste thy love divinely free.


   Let Babel fear when Zion prays;

   Babel, prepare for long distress,

   When Zion's God himself arrays

   In terror and in righteousness.


   With dreadful glory God fulfils

   What his afflicted saints request;

   And with almighty wrath reveals

   His love, to give his churches rest.


   Then shall the flocking nations run

   To Zion's hill, and own their Lord;

   L. M.

   Divine providence in air, earth, and sea.


   The God of our salvation hears

   The groans of Zion mixed with tears;

   Yet when he comes with kind designs,

   Through all the way his terror shines.


   On him the race of man depends,

   Far as the earth's remotest ends,

   Where the Creator's name is known

   By nature's feeble light alone.


   Sailors, that travel o'er the flood,

   Address their frighted souls to God,

   When tempests rage and billows roar

   At dreadful distance from the shore.


   He bids the noisy tempests cease;

   He calms the raging crowd to peace,

   When a tumultuous nation raves

   Wild as the winds, and loud as waves.


   Whole kingdoms, shaken by the storm,

   He settles in a peaceful form;

   Mountains, established by his hand,

   Firm on their old foundations stand.


   Behold his ensigns sweep the sky,

   New comets blaze, and lightnings fly;

   The heathen lands, with swift surprise,

   From the bright horrors turn their eyes.


   At his command the morning ray

   Smiles in the east, and leads the day;

   He guides the sun's declining wheels

   Over the tops of western hills.


   Seasons and times obey his voice;

   The ev'ning and the morn rejoice

   To see the earth made soft with showers,

   Laden with fruit, and dressed in flowers.


   'Tis from his wat'ry stores on high

   He gives the thirsty ground supply;

   He walks upon the clouds, and thence

   Doth his enriching drops dispense.


   The desert grows a fruitful field,

   Abundant food the valleys yield;

   The valleys shout with cheerful voice,

   And neighb'ring hills repeat their joys.


   The pastures smile in green array;

   There lambs and larger cattle play;

   The larger cattle and the lamb

   Each in his language speaks thy name.


   Thy works pronounce thy power divine;

   O'er every field thy glories shine;

   Through every month thy gifts appear;

   Great God, thy goodness crowns the year!
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 65 PART 1

   C. M.

   A prayer-hearing God, and the Gentiles called.


   Praise waits in Zion, Lord, for thee;

   There shall our vows be paid:

   Thou hast an ear when sinners pray;

   All flesh shall seek thine aid.


   Lord, our iniquities prevail,

   But pard'ning grace is thine;

   And thou wilt grant us power and skill

   To conquer every sin.


   Blest are the men whom thou wilt choose

   To bring them near thy face,

   Give them a dwelling in thine house,

   To feast upon thy grace.


   In answ'ring what thy church requests

   Thy truth and terror shine,

   And works of dreadful righteousness

   Fulfil thy kind design.


   Thus shall the wond'ring nations see

   The Lord is good and just;

   And distant islands fly to thee,

   And make thy name their trust.


   They dread thy glitt'ring tokens, Lord,

   When signs in heav'n appear;

   But they shall learn thy holy word,

   And love as well as fear.

  PSALM 65 PART 2

   C. M.

   The providence of God in air, earth, and sea.


   'Tis by thy strength the mountains stand,

   God of eternal power;

   The sea grows calm at thy command,

   And tempests cease to roar.


   Thy morning light and ev'ning shade

   Successive comforts bring;

   Thy plenteous fruits make harvest glad,

   Thy flowers adorn the spring.


   Seasons and times, and moons and hours,

   Heav'n, earth, and air, are thine;

   When clouds distil in fruitful showers,

   The Author is divine.


   Those wand'ring cisterns in the sky,

   Borne by the winds around

   With wat'ry treasures well supply

   The furrows of the ground.


   The thirsty ridges drink their fill,

   And ranks of corn appear;

   Thy ways abound with blessings still,

   Thy goodness crowns the year.

  PSALM 65 PART 3

   C. M.

   The blessings of the spring; or, God gives rain.

   A Psalm for the husbandman.


   Good is the Lord, the heav'nly King,

   Who makes the earth his care;

   Visits the pastures ev'ry spring,

   And bids the grass appear.


   The clouds, like rivers raised on high,

   Pour out at thy command

   Their wat'ry blessings from the sky,

   To cheer the thirsty land.


   The softened ridges of the field

   Permit the corn to spring;

   The valleys rich provision yield,

   And the poor lab'rers sing.


   The little hills, on every side,

   Rejoice at falling showers;

   The meadows, dressed in all their pride,

   Perfume the air with flowers.


   The barren clods, refreshed with rain,

   Promise a joyful crop;

   The parching grounds look green again,

   And raise the reaper's hope.


   The various months thy goodness crowns;

   How bounteous are thy ways!

   The bleating flocks spread o'er the downs,

   And shepherds shout thy praise.

  PSALM 66 PART 1

   C. M.

   Governing power and goodness; or, Our graces tried by afflictions.


   Sing, all ye nations, to the Lord,

   Sing with a joyful noise;

   With melody of sound record

   His honors and your joys.


   Say to the Power that shakes the sky,

   "How terrible art thou!

   Sinners before thy presence fly,

   Or at thy feet they bow."


   [Come, see the wonders of our God,

   How glorious are his ways!

   In Moses' hand he puts his rod,

   And cleaves the frighted seas.


   He made the ebbing channel dry,

   While Isr'el passed the flood

   There did the church begin their joy,

   And triumph in their God.]


   He rules by his resistless might:

   Will rebel mortals dare

   Provoke th' Eternal to the fight,

   And tempt that dreadful war?


   O bless our God, and never cease;

   Ye saints, fulfil his praise;

   He keeps our life, maintains our peace,

   And guides our doubtful ways.


   Lord, thou hast proved our suff'ring souls,

   To make our graces shine;

   So silver bears the burning coals,

   The metal to refine.


   Through wat'ry deeps, and fiery ways,

   We march at thy command;

   Led to possess the promised place

   By thine unerring hand.

  PSALM 66 PART 2

   v.13-20

   C. M.

   Praise to God for hearing prayer.


   Now shall my solemn vows be paid

   To that Almighty Power,

   That heard the long requests I made

   In my distressful hour.


   My lips and cheerful heart prepare

   To make his mercies known;

   Come, ye that fear my God, and hear

   The wonders he has done.


   When on my head huge sorrows fell,

   I sought his heav'nly aid;

   He saved my sinking soul from hell,

   And death's eternal shade.


   If sin lay covered in my heart,

   While prayer employed my tongue,

   The Lord had shown me no regard,

   Nor I his praises sung.


   But God (his name be ever blest)

   Has set my spirit free;

   Nor turned from him my poor request,

   Nor turned his heart from me.

   C. M.

   The nation's prosperity, and the church's increase.


   Shine, mighty God, on Britain shine,

   With beams of heav'nly grace;

   Reveal thy power through all our coasts,

   And show thy smiling face.


   [Amidst our isle, exalted high,

   Do thou our glory stand,

   And, like a wall of guardian fire,

   Surround the fav'rite land.]


   When shall thy name, from shore to shore,

   Sound all the earth abroad;

   And distant nations know and love

   Their Savior and their God?


   Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands,

   Sing loud with solemn voice;

   While British tongues exalt his praise,

   And British hearts rejoice.


   He, the great Lord, the sovereign Judge,

   That sits enthroned above,

   Wisely commands the worlds he made

   In justice and in love.


   Earth shall obey her Maker's will,

   And yield a full increase;

   Our God will crown his chosen isle

   With fruitfulness and peace.


   God the Redeemer scatters round

   His choicest favors here,

   While the creation's utmost bound

   Shall see, adore, and fear.

   L. M.

   The vengeance and compassion of God.

   PAUSE.


   Let God arise in all his might,

   And put the troops of hell to flight,

   As smoke that sought to cloud the skies

   Before the rising tempest flies.


   [He comes arrayed in burning flames

   Justice and Vengeance are his names:

   Behold his fainting foes expire,

   Like melting wax before the fire.]


   He rides and thunders through the sky;

   His name, Jehovah, sounds on high

   Sing to his name, ye sons of grace;

   Ye saints, rejoice before his face.


   The widow and the fatherless

   Fly to his aid in sharp distress;

   In him the poor and helpless find

   A Judge that's just, a Father kind.


   He breaks the captive's heavy chain,

   And prisoners see the light again;

   But rebels that dispute his will

   Shall dwell in chains and darkness still.


   Kingdoms and thrones to God belong;

   Crown him, ye nations, in your song:

   His wondrous names and powers rehearse;

   His honors shall enrich your verse.


   He shakes the heav'ns with loud alarms;

   How terrible is God in arms!

   In Isr'el are his mercies known,

   Isr'el is his peculiar throne.


   Proclaim him King, pronounce him blest;

   He's your defence, your joy, your rest:

   When terrors rise and nations faint,

   God is the strength of every saint.

   Christ's ascension, and the gift of the Spirit.


   Lord, when thou didst ascend on high,

   Ten thousand angels filled the sky;

   Those heav'nly guards around thee wait,

   Like chariots that attend thy state.


   Not Sinai's mountain could appear

   More glorious when the Lord was there;

   While he pronounced his dreadful law,

   And struck the chosen tribes with awe.


   How bright the triumph none can tell,

   When the rebellious powers of hell,

   That thousand souls had captive made,

   Were all in chains like captives led.


   Raised by his Father to the throne,

   He sent the promised Spirit down

   With gifts and grace for rebel men,

   That God might dwell on earth again.

  PSALM 68 PART 3

   v.19,9,20-22

   L. M.

   Praise for temporal blessings; or, Common and special mercies.


   We bless the Lord, the just, the good,

   Who fills our hearts with joy and food:

   Who pours his blessings from the skies,

   And loads our days with rich supplies.


   He sends the sun his circuit round,

   To cheer the fruits, to warm the ground;

   He bids the clouds with plenteous rain

   Refresh the thirsty earth again.


   'Tis to his care we owe our breath,

   And all our near escapes from death;

   Safety and health to God belong;

   He heals the weak, and guards the strong.


   He makes the saint and sinner prove

   The common blessings of his love;

   But the wide diff'rence that remains,

   Is endless joy, or endless pains.


   The Lord, that bruised the serpent's head,

   On all the serpent's seed shall tread;

   The stubborn sinner's hope confound,

   And smite him with a lasting wound.


   But his right hand his saints shall raise

   From the deep earth, or deeper seas,

   And bring them to his courts above;

   There shall they taste his special love.

   C. M.

   The sufferings of Christ for our salvation.


   "Save me, O God, the swelling floods

   Break in upon my soul;

   I sink, and sorrows o'er my head

   Like mighty waters roll.


   "I cry till all my voice be gone,

   In tears I waste the day:

   My God, behold my longing eyes,

   And shorten thy delay.


   "They hate my soul without a cause,

   And still their number grows

   More than the hairs around my head,

   And mighty are my foes.


   "'Twas then I paid that dreadful debt

   That men could never pay,

   And gave those honors to thy law

   Which sinners took away."


   Thus in the great Messiah's name,

   The royal prophet mourns;

   Thus he awakes our hearts to grief,

   And gives us joy by turns.


   "Now shall the saints rejoice, and find

   Salvation in my name;

   For I have borne their heavy load

   Of sorrow, pain, and shame.


   "Grief, like a garment, clothed me round,

   And sackcloth was my dress,

   While I procured for naked souls

   A robe of righteousness.


   "Amongst my brethren and the Jews

   I like a stranger stood,

   And bore their vile reproach, to bring

   The Gentiles near to God.


   "I came in sinful mortals' stead,

   To do my Father's will;

   Yet when I cleansed my Father's house,

   They scandalized my zeal.


   "My fasting and my holy groans

   Were made the drunkard's song;

   But God, from his celestial throne,

   Heard my complaining tongue.


   "He saved me from the dreadful deep,

   Nor let my soul be drowned;

   He raised and fixed my sinking feet

   On well-established ground.


   "'Twas in a most accepted hour

   My prayer arose on high;

   And for my sake my God shall hear

   The dying sinner's cry.

   The passion and exaltation of Christ.


   Now let our lips with holy fear

   And mournful pleasure sing

   The suff'rings of our great High Priest,

   The sorrows of our King.


   He sinks in floods of deep distress;

   How high the waters rise!

   While to his heav'nly Father's ear

   He sends perpetual cries.


   "Hear me, O Lord, and save thy Son,

   Nor hide thy shining face;

   Why should thy fav'rite look like one

   Forsaken of thy grace?


   "With rage they persecute the man

   That groans beneath thy wound,

   While for a sacrifice I pour

   My life upon the ground.


   "They tread my honor to the dust,

   And laugh when I complain;

   Their sharp insulting slanders add

   Fresh anguish to my pain.


   "All my reproach is known to thee,

   The scandal and the shame;

   Reproach has broke my bleeding heart,

   And lies defiled my name.


   "I looked for pity, but in vain;

   My kindred are my grief:

   I ask my friends for comfort round,

   But meet with no relief.


   "With vinegar they mock my thirst,

   They give me gall for food;

   And sporting with my dying groans,

   They triumph in my blood.


   "Shine into my distressed soul,

   Let thy compassions save;

   And though my flesh sink down to death,

   Redeem it from the grave.


   "I shall arise to praise thy name,

   Shall reign in worlds unknown;

   And thy salvation, O my God,

   Shall seat me on thy throne."

   Christ's obedience and death; or, God glorified and sinners saved.


   Father, I sing thy wondrous grace,

   I bless my Savior's name;

   He bought salvation for the poor,

   And bore the sinner's shame.


   His deep distress has raised us high;

   His duty and his zeal

   Fulfilled the law which mortals broke,

   And finished all thy will.


   His dying groans, his living songs,

   Shall better please my God

   Than harp or trumpet's solemn sound,

   Than goat's or bullock's blood.


   This shall his humble followers see,

   And set their hearts at rest

   They by his death draw near to thee,

   And live for ever blest.


   Let heav'n and all that dwell on high

   To God their voices raise,

   While lands and seas assist the sky,

   And join t' advance the praise.


   Zion is thine, most holy God,

   Thy Son shall bless her gates;

   And glory purchased by his blood

   For thy own Isr'el waits.

   Deep in our hearts let us record

   The deeper sorrows of our Lord;

   Behold the rising billows roll,

   To overwhelm his holy soul.


   In long complaints he spends his breath,

   While hosts of hell, and powers of death,

   And all the sons of malice, join

   To execute their cursed design.


   Yet, gracious God, thy power and love

   Has made the curse a blessing prove;

   Those dreadful suff'rings of thy Son

   Atoned for sins which we had done.


   The pangs of our expiring Lord

   The honors of thy law restored;

   His sorrows made thy justice known,

   And paid for follies not his own.


   O for his sake our guilt forgive,

   And let the mourning sinner live;

   The Lord will hear us in his name,

   Nor shall our hope be turned to shame.

   L. M.

   Christ's sufferings and zeal.


   'Twas for thy sake, eternal God,

   Thy Son sustained that heavy load

   Of base reproach and sore disgrace,

   And shame defiled his sacred face.


   The Jews, his brethren and his kin,

   Abused the Man that checked their sin;

   While he fulfilled thy holy laws,

   They hate him, but without a cause.


   ["My Father's house," said he, "was made

   A place for worship, not for trade:"

   Then scatt'ring all their gold and brass

   He scourged the merchants from the place.]


   [Zeal for the temple of his God

   Consumed his life, exposed his blood;

   Reproaches at thy glory thrown

   He felt, and mourned them as his own.]


   [His friends forsook, his followers fled,

   While foes and arms surround his head;

   They curse him with a sland'rous tongue,

   And the false judge maintains the wrong.]


   His life they load with hateful lies,

   And charge his lips with blasphemies;

   They nail him to the shameful tree:

   There hung the Man that died for me.


   [Wretches with hearts as hard as stones

   Insult his piety and groans;

   Gall was the food they gave him there,

   And mocked his thirst with vinegar.]


   But God beheld, and from his throne

   Marks out the men that hate his Son;

   The hand that raised him from the dead,

   Shall pour the vengeance on their head.

   Thine hands have held my childhood up,

   And strengthened all my youth.


   My flesh was fashioned by thy power,

   With all these limbs of mine;

   And from my mother's painful hour,

   I've been entirely thine.


   Still has my life new wonders seen

   Repeated every year;

   Behold, my days that yet remain,

   Cast me not off when strength declines,

   When hoary hairs arise;

   And round me let thy glory shine,

   Whene'er thy servant dies.

   And since I knew thy graces first,

   I speak thy glories more.


   My feet shall travel all the length

   Of the celestial road,

   And march with courage in thy strength,

   To see my Father God.


   When I am filled with sore distress

   For some surprising sin,

   I'll plead thy perfect righteousness,

   And mention none but thine.


   How will my lips rejoice to tell

   The vict'ries of my King!

   My soul, redeemed from sin and hell,

   Shall thy salvation sing.


   My tongue shall all the day proclaim

   My Savior and my God;

   His death has brought my foes to shame,

   And drowned them in his blood.

   God of my childhood and my youth,

   I have declared thy heav'nly truth,

   And told thy wondrous ways.


   Wilt thou forsake my hoary hairs,

   And leave my fainting heart?

   Who shall sustain my sinking years,

   If God my strength depart?


   Let me thy power and truth proclaim

   And leave a savor of thy name

   When I shall quit the stage.

   Attends my next remove;

   O may these poor remains of breath

   Thy righteousness is deep and high,

   Unsearchable thy deeds;

   Thy glory spreads beyond the sky,

   Thy grace was my relief.


   By long experience have I known

   Thy sovereign power to save;

   At thy command I venture down

   Securely to the grave.

   Dwell on his love with sweetest song;

   And infant voices shall proclaim

   Their early blessings on his name.


   Blessings abound where'er he reigns,

   The pris'ner leaps to lose his chains;

   The weary find eternal rest,

   And all the sons of want are blest.


   [Where he displays his healing power

   Death and the curse are known no more;

   In him the tribes of Adam boast

   More blessings than their father lost.


   Let every creature rise and bring

   Peculiar honors to our King;

   Angels descend with songs again,

   And earth repeat the long Amen.]

   Afflicted saints happy, and prosperous sinners cursed.


   Now I'm convinced the Lord is kind

   To men of heart sincere;

   Yet once my foolish thoughts repined,

   And bordered on despair.


   I grieved to see the wicked thrive,

   And spoke with angry breath,

   "How pleasant and profane they live!

   How peaceful is their death!


   "With well-fed flesh and haughty eyes,

   They lay their fears to sleep;

   Against the heav'ns their slanders rise,

   While saints in silence weep.


   "In vain I lift my hands to pray,

   And cleanse my heart in vain;

   For I am chastened all the day,

   The night renews my pain."


   Yet while my tongue indulged complaints,

   I felt my heart reprove,-

   "Sure I shall thus offend thy saints,

   And grieve the men I love."


   But still I found my doubts too hard,

   The conflict too severe,

   Till I retired to search thy word,

   And learn thy secrets there.


   There, as in some prophetic glass,

   I saw the sinner's feet

   High mounted on a slipp'ry place,

   Beside a fiery pit.


   I heard the wretch profanely boast,

   Till at thy frown he fell;

   His honors in a dream were lost,

   And he awakes in hell.


   Lord, what an envious fool I was!

   How like a thoughtless beast!

   Thus to suspect thy promised grace,

   And think the wicked blest.


   Yet I was kept from full despair,

   Upheld by power unknown;

   That blessed hand that broke the snare

   Shall guide me to thy throne.

   When sinking in despair.


   Thy counsels, Lord, shall guide my feet

   Through this dark wilderness;

   Thine hand conduct me near thy seat,

   To dwell before thy face.


   Were I in heav'n without my God,

   'Twould be no joy to me;

   And whilst this earth is my abode,

   I long for none but thee.


   What if the springs of life were broke,

   And flesh and heart should faint?

   God is my soul's eternal rock,

   The strength of every saint.


   Behold, the sinners that remove

   Far from thy presence die;

   Not all the idol gods they love

   Can save them when they cry.


   But to draw near to thee, my God,

   Shall be my sweet employ;

   My tongue shall sound thy works abroad,

   And tell the world my joy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 73

   v.22,3,6,17-20

   L. M.

   The prosperity of sinners cursed.


   Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I,

   To mourn, and murmur, and repine,

   To see the wicked placed on high,

   In pride and robes of honor shine!


   But O their end, their dreadful end!

   Thy sanctuary taught me so;

   On slipp'ry rocks I see them stand,

   And fiery billows roll below.


   Now let them boast how tall they rise,

   I'll never envy them again;

   There they may stand with haughty eyes,

   Till they plunge deep in endless pain.


   Their fancied joys, how fast they flee!

   Just like a dream when man awakes;

   Their songs of softest harmony

   Are but a preface to their plagues.


   Now I esteem their mirth and wine

   Too dear to purchase with my blood;

   Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine,

   My life, my portion, and my God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 73

   S. M.

   The mystery of providence unfolded.


   Sure there's a righteous God,

   Nor is religion vain;

   Though men of vice may boast aloud,

   And men of grace complain.


   I saw the wicked rise,

   And felt my heart repine,

   While haughty fools with scornful eyes

   In robes of honor shine.


   [Pampered with wanton ease,

   Their flesh looks full and fair;

   Their wealth rolls in like flowing seas,

   And grows without their care.


   Free from the plagues and pains

   That pious souls endure;

   Through all their life oppression reigns,

   And racks the humble poor.


   Their impious tongues blaspheme

   The everlasting God;

   Their malice blasts the good man's name,

   And spreads their lies abroad.


   But I with flowing tears

   Indulged my doubts to rise;

   "Is there a God that sees or hears

   The things below the skies?"]


   The tumults of my thought

   Held me in hard suspense,

   Till to thy house my feet were brought,

   To learn thy justice thence.


   Thy word with light and power

   Did my mistake amend;

   I viewed the sinners' life before,

   But here I learnt their end.


   On what a slipp'ry steep

   The thoughtless wretches go;

   And O that dreadful fiery deep

   That waits their fall below!


   Lord, at thy feet I bow,

   My thoughts no more repine;

   I call my God my portion now,

   And all my powers are thine.

   The church pleading with God under sore persecutions.

   PAUSE.


   Will God for ever cast us off?

   His wrath for ever smoke

   Against the people of his love,

   His little chosen flock?


   Think of the tribes so dearly bought

   With their Redeemer's blood;

   Nor let thy Zion be forgot,

   Where once thy glory stood.


   Lift up thy feet and march in haste,

   Aloud our ruin calls;

   See what a wide and fearful waste

   Is made within thy walls.


   Where once thy churches prayed and sang,

   Thy foes profanely roar;

   Over thy gates their ensigns hang,

   Sad tokens of their power.


   How are the seats of worship broke!

   They tear the buildings down,

   And he that deals the heaviest stroke

   Procures the chief renown.


   With flames they threaten to destroy

   Thy children in their nest;

   "Come, let us burn at once," they cry,

   "The temple and the priest."


   And still, to heighten our distress,

   Thy presence is withdrawn;

   Thy wonted signs of power and grace,

   Thy power and grace are gone.


   No prophet speaks to calm our woes,

   But all the seers mourn;

   There's not a soul amongst us knows

   The time of thy return.


   How long, eternal God, how long

   Shall men of pride blaspheme?

   Shall saints be made their endless song,

   And bear immortal shame?


   Canst thou for ever sit and hear

   Thine holy name profaned?

   And still thy jealousy forbear,

   And still withhold thine hand?


   What strange deliv'rance hast thou shown

   In ages long before!

   And now no other God we own,

   No other God adore.


   Thou didst divide the raging sea

   By thy resistless might,

   To make thy tribes a wondrous way,

   And then secure their flight.


   Is not the world of nature thine,

   The darkness and the day?

   Didst thou not bid the morning shine,

   And mark the sun his way?


   Hath not thy power formed every coast,

   And set the earth its bounds,

   With summer's heat, and winter's frost,

   In their perpetual rounds?


   And shall the sons of earth and dust

   That sacred power blaspheme?

   Will not thy hand that formed them first

   Avenge thine injured name?


   Think oh the cov'nant thou hast made,

   And all thy words of love;

   Nor let the birds of prey invade,

   And vex thy mourning dove.


   Our foes would triumph in our blood,

   And make our hope their jest;

   Plead thy own cause, Almighty God,

   And give thy children rest.

   Power and government from God alone.

   [Applied to the glorious Revolution by King William, or the happy
   accession of King George to the throne.]


   To thee, most Holy and most High,

   To thee we bring our thankful praise;

   Thy works declare thy name is nigh,

   Thy works of wonder and of grace.


   Britain was doomed to be a slave,

   Her frame dissolved, her fears were great;

   When God a new supporter gave,

   To bear the pillars of the state.


   He from thy hand received his crown,

   And sware to rule by wholesome laws;

   His foot shall tread th' oppressor down,

   His arm defend the righteous cause.


   Let haughty sinners sink their pride,

   Nor lift so high their scornful head;

   But lay their foolish thoughts aside,

   And own the king that God hath made.


   Such honors never come by chance,

   Nor do the winds promotion blow;

   'Tis God the Judge doth one advance,

   'Tis God that lays another low.


   No vain pretence to royal birth

   Shall fix a tyrant on the throne:

   God, the great Sovereign of the earth,

   Will rise and make his justice known.


   [His hand holds out the dreadful cup

   Of vengeance mixed with various plagues,

   To make the wicked drink them up,

   Wring out and taste the bitter dregs.


   Now shall the Lord exalt the just;

   And while he tramples on the proud,

   And lays their glory in the dust,

   My lips shall sing his praise aloud.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 76

   C. M.

   Israel saved, and the Assyrians destroyed.


   In Judah God of old was known;

   His name in Isr'el great;

   In Salem stood his holy throne,

   And Zion was his seat.


   Among the praises of his saints

   His dwelling there he chose;

   There he received their just complaints

   Against their haughty foes.


   From Zion went his dreadful word,

   And broke the threat'ning spear,

   The bow, the arrows, and the sword,

   And crushed th' Assyrian war.


   What are the earth's wide kingdoms else

   But mighty hills of prey?

   The hill on which Jehovah dwells

   Is glorious more than they.


   'Twas Zion's King that stopped the breath

   Of captains and their bands;

   The men of might slept fast in death,

   And never found their hands.


   At thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,

   Both horse and chariot fell:

   Who knows the terrors of thy rod?

   Thy vengeance who can tell?


   What power can stand before thy sight,

   When once thy wrath appears?

   When heav'n shines round with dreadful light,

   The earth lies still and fears.


   When God in his own sovereign ways

   Comes down to save th' oppressed,

   The wrath of man shall work his praise,

   And he'll restrain the rest.


   [Vow to the Lord, and tribute bring,

   Ye princes, fear his frown;

   His terror shakes the proudest king,

   And cuts an army down.


   The thunder of his sharp rebuke

   Our haughty foes shall feel;

   For Jacob's God hath not forsook

   But dwells in Zion still.]

  PSALM 77 PART 1

   C. M.

   Melancholy assaulting, and hope prevailing.


   To God I cried with mournful voice,

   I sought his gracious ear,

   In the sad day when troubles rose,

   And filled the night with fear.


   Sad were my days, and dark my nights,

   My soul refused relief;

   I thought on God the just and wise,

   But thoughts increased my grief.


   Still I complained, and still oppressed,

   My heart began to break;

   My God, thy wrath forbade my rest,

   And kept my eyes awake.


   My overwhelming sorrows grew,

   Till I could speak no more;

   Then I within myself withdrew,

   And called thy judgments o'er.


   I called back years and ancient times

   When I beheld thy face;

   My spirit searched for secret crimes

   That might withhold thy grace.


   I called thy mercies to my mind

   Which I enjoyed before;

   And will the Lord no more be kind?

   His face appear no more?


   Will he for ever cast me off?

   His promise ever fail?

   Has he forgot his tender love?

   Shall anger still prevail?


   But I forbid this hopeless thought;

   This dark, despairing frame,

   Rememb'ring what thy hand hath wrought;

   Thy hand is still the same.


   I'll think again of all thy ways,

   And talk thy wonders o'er;

   Thy wonders of recovering grace,

   When flesh could hope no more.


   Grace dwells with justice on the throne;

   And men that love thy word

   Have in thy sanctuary known

   The counsels of the Lord.

   Comfort derived from ancient providences.


   "How awful is thy chast'ning rod!"

   May thy own children say:

   "The great, the wise, the dreadful God!

   How holy is his way !"


   I'll meditate his works of old,

   The King that reigns above;

   I'll hear his ancient wonders told,

   And learn to trust his love.


   Long did the house of Joseph lie

   With Egypt's yoke oppressed;

   Long he delayed to hear their cry,

   or gave his people rest.


   The sons of good old Jacob seemed

   Abandoned to their foes;

   But his almighty arm redeemed

   The nation that he chose.


   Isr'el, his people and his sheep,

   Must follow where he calls;

   He bade them venture through the deep,

   And made the waves their walls.


   The waters saw thee, mighty God!

   The waters saw thee come;

   Backward they fled, and frighted stood,

   To make thine armies room.


   Strange was thy journey through the sea

   Thy footsteps, Lord, unknown;

   Terrors attend the wondrous way

   That brings thy mercies down.


   [Thy voice, with terror in the sound,

   Through clouds and darkness broke;

   All heav'n in lightning shone around,

   And earth with thunder shook.


   Thine arrows through the skies were hurled;

   How glorious is the Lord!

   Surprise and trembling seized the world,

   And his own saints adored.


   He gave them water from the rock,

   And safe, by Moses' hand,

   Through a dry desert led his flock

   Home to the promised land.]

   And which our fathers told.


   He bids us make his glories known,

   His works of power and grace;

   And we'll convey his wonders down

   Through every rising race.


   Our lips shall tell them to our sons,

   And they again to theirs;

   That generations yet unborn

   May teach them to their heirs.


   Thus shall they learn in God alone

   Their hope securely stands;

   That they may ne'er forget his works,

   But practise his commands.

   C. M.

   Israel's rebellion and punishment.


   O What a stiff rebellious house

   Was Jacob's ancient race!

   False to their own most solemn vows,

   And to their Maker's grace.


   They broke the cov'nant of his love,

   And did his laws despise;

   Forgot the works he wrought to prove

   His power before their eyes.


   They saw the plagues on Egypt light

   From his revenging hand;

   What dreadful tokens of his might

   Spread o'er the stubborn land!


   They saw him cleave the mighty sea,

   And marched in safety through,

   With wat'ry walls to guard their way,

   Till they had 'scaped the foe.


   A wondrous pillar marked the road,

   Composed of shade and light;

   By day it proved a shelt'ring cloud,

   A leading fire by night.


   He from the rock their thirst supplied

   The gushing waters fell,

   And ran in rivers by their side,

   A constant miracle.


   Yet they provoked the Lord most High,

   And dared distrust his hand:

   "Can he with bread our host supply

   Amidst this desert land?"


   The Lord with indignation heard,

   And caused his wrath to flame;

   His terrors ever stand prepared

   To vindicate his name.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 78 PART 3

   C. M.

   The punishment of luxury and intemperance.


   When Isr'el sins, the Lord reproves

   And fills their hearts with dread;

   Yet he forgives the men he loves,

   And sends them heav'nly bread.


   He fed them with a lib'ral hand,

   And made his treasures known;

   He gave the midnight clouds command

   To pour provision down.


   The manna, like a morning shower,

   Lay thick around their feet

   The corn of heav'n, so light, so pure,

   As though 'twere angels' meat.


   But they in murm'ring language said,

   "Manna is all our feast;

   We loathe this light, this airy bread;

   We must have flesh to taste."


   "Ye shall have flesh to please your lust,"

   The Lord in wrath replied,

   And sent them quails like sand or dust,

   Heaped up from side to side.


   He gave them all their own desire,

   And greedy as they fed,

   His vengeance burnt with secret fire,

   And smote the rebels dead.


   When some were slain, the rest returned

   And sought the Lord with tears;

   Under the rod they feared and mourned,

   But soon forgot their fears.


   Oft he chastised and still forgave,

   Till, by his gracious hand,

   The nation he resolved to save

   Possessed the promised land.

   Backsliding and forgiveness; or, Sin punished and saints saved.


   Great God, how oft did Isr'el prove

   By turns thine anger and thy love!

   There in a glass our hearts may see

   How fickle and how false they be.


   How soon the faithless Jews forgot

   The dreadful wonders God had wrought!

   Then they provoke him to his face,

   Nor fear his power, nor trust his grace.


   The Lord consumed their years ill pain,

   And made their travels long and vain;

   A tedious march through unknown ways

   Wore out their strength, and spent their days.


   Oft when they saw their brethren slain

   They mourned, and sought the Lord again;

   Called him the Rock of their abode,

   Their high Redeemer, and their God.


   Their prayers and vows before him rise

   As flatt'ring words or solemn lies,

   While their rebellious tempers prove

   False to his cov'nant and his love.


   Yet did his sovereign grace forgive

   The men who not deserved to live;

   His anger oft away he turned,

   Or else with gentle flame it burned.


   He saw their flesh was weak and frail,

   He saw temptations still prevail;

   The God of Abram loved them still,

   And led them to his holy hill.

   Great Shepherd of thine Israel,

   Who didst between the cherubs dwell,

   And lead the tribes, thy chosen sheep,

   Safe through the desert and the deep;


   Thy church is in the desert now,

   Shine from on high and guide us through;

   Turn us to thee, thy love restore,

   We shall be saved and sigh no more.


   Great God, whom heav'nly hosts obey,

   How long shall we lament and pray,

   And wait in vain thy kind return?

   How long shall thy fierce anger burn?


   Instead of wine and cheerful bread

   Thy saints with their own tears are fed:

   Turn us to thee, thy love restore,

   We shall be saved, and sigh no more.


   Hast thou not planted with thy hands

   A lovely vine in heathen lands?

   Did not thy power defend it round,

   And heav'nly dews enrich the ground?


   How did the spreading branches shoot,

   And bless the nations with the fruit!

   But now, dear Lord, look down and see

   Thy mourning vine, that lovely tree.


   Why is its beauty thus defaced?

   Why hast thou laid her fences waste?

   Strangers and foes against her join,

   And every beast devours the vine.


   Return, Almighty God, return,

   Nor let thy bleeding vineyard mourn;

   Turn us to thee, thy love restore,

   We shall be saved, and sigh no more.


   Lord, when this vine in Canaan grew,

   Thou wast its strength and glory too;

   Attacked in vain by all its foes,

   Till the fair Branch of Promise rose:


   Fair Branch, ordained of old to shoot

   From David's stock, from Jacob's root;

   Himself a noble vine, and we

   The lesser branches of the tree.


   'Tis thy own Son; and he shall stand

   Girt with thy strength at thy right hand;

   Thy first-born Son, adorned and blest

   With power and grace above the rest.


   O for his sake attend our cry,

   Shine on thy churches lest they die;

   Turn us to thee, thy love restore,

   We shall be saved, and sigh no more.

   Their name of earthly gods is vain,

   That love the way

   To Zion's hill.


   They go from strength to strength,

   Through this dark vale of tears,

   Till each arrives at length,

   Till each in heav'n appears:

   O glorious seat,

   When God our King

   Shall thither bring

   Our willing feet!


   To spend one sacred day

   Where God and saints abide,

   Affords diviner joy

   Than thousand days beside:

   Where God resorts,

   I love it more

   To keep the door

   Than shine in courts.


   God is our sun and shield,

   Our light and our defence;

   With gifts his hands are filled,

   We draw our blessings thence:

   He shall bestow

   On Jacob's race

   Peculiar grace

   And glory too.


   The Lord his people loves;

   His hand no good withholds

   From those his heart approves,

   From pure and pious souls:

   Thrice happy he,

   O God of hosts,

   Whose spirit trusts

   Alone in thee.

   Waiting for an answer to prayer; or, Deliverance begun and completed.


   Lord, thou hast called thy grace to mind,

   Thou hast reversed our heavy doom;

   So God forgave when Isr'el sinned,

   And brought his wand'ring captives home.


   Thou hast begun to set us free,

   And made thy fiercest wrath abate;

   Now let our hearts be turned to thee,

   And thy salvation be complete.


   Revive our dying graces, Lord,

   And let thy saints in thee rejoice;

   Make known thy truth, fulfil thy word;

   We wait for praise to tune our voice.


   We wait to hear what God will say;

   He'll speak, and give his people peace;

   Salvation by Christ.


   Salvation is for ever nigh

   The souls that fear and trust the Lord

   And grace descending from on high

   Fresh hopes of glory shall afford.


   Mercy and truth on earth are met,

   Since Christ the Lord came down from heav'n;

   By his obedience so complete,

   Justice is pleased, and peace is giv'n.


   Now truth and honor shall abound,

   Religion dwell on earth again,

   And heav'nly influence bless the ground

   In our Redeemer's gentle reign.


   His righteousness is gone before

   Nor are their works, like thine.


   The nations thou hast made shall bring

   Their off'rings round thy throne;

   For thou art God alone.


   Lord, I would walk with holy feet;

   Teach me thine heav'nly ways,

   But still in Zion loves to dwell.


   His mercy visits every house

   That pay their night and morning vows;

   But makes a more delightful stay

   Where churches meet to praise and pray.


   What glories were described of old!

   What wonders are of Zion told!

   "David, my servant, whom I chose

   How long the race of David held

   The promised Jewish throne!

   But there's a nobler cov'nant sealed

   How bright thine armies shine!

   Where is the power that vies with thee,

   The northern pole and southern rest

   Move round at thy command.


   Thy words the raging winds control,

   And rule the boist'rous deep;

   Thou mak'st the sleeping billows roll,

   The rolling billows sleep.


   Heav'n, earth, and air, and sea, are thine,

   And the dark world of hell;

   How did thine arm in vengeance shine

   But faith forbids these mournful sighs,

   How few his hours! how short his span!

   Short from the cradle to the grave

   Who can secure his vital breath

   Against the bold demands of death,

   With skill to fly, or power to save?


   Lord, shall it be for ever said,

   "The race of man was only made

   For sickness, sorrow, and the dust?"

   Are not thy servants day by day

   Sent to their graves, and turned to clay?

   Lord, where's thy kindness to the just?


   Hast thou not promised to thy Son

   And all his seed a heav'nly crown?

   But flesh and sense indulge despair:

   For ever blessed be the Lord,

   That faith can read his holy word,

   And find a resurrection there.


   For ever blessed be the Lord,

   Who gives his saints a long reward

   For all their toil, reproach, and pain:

   L. M.

   Man mortal, and God eternal

   A mournful song at a funeral.

   PAUSE.


   Through every age, eternal God,

   Thou art our rest, our safe abode;

   High was thy throne ere heav'n was made,

   Or earth thy humble footstool laid.


   Long hadst thou reigned ere time began,

   Or dust was fashioned to a man;

   And long thy kingdom shall endure

   When earth and time shall be no more.


   But man, weak man, is born to die,

   Made up of guilt and vanity;

   Thy dreadful sentence, Lord, was just,

   "Return, ye sinners, to your dust."


   [A thousand of our years amount

   Scarce to a day in thine account;

   Like yesterday's departed light,

   Or the last watch of ending night.


   Death, like an overflowing stream,

   Sweeps us away; our life's a dream,

   An empty tale, a morning flower,

   Cut down and withered in an hour.]


   [Our age to seventy years is set;

   How short the time! how frail the state!

   And if to eighty we arrive,

   We rather sigh and groan than live.


   But O how oft thy wrath appears,

   And cuts off our expected years!

   Thy wrath awakes our humble dread;

   We fear the power that strikes us dead.]


   Teach us, O Lord, how frail is man;

   And kindly lengthen out our span,

   Till a wise care of piety

   Fit us to die, and dwell with thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 90 PART 1

   C. M.

   Man frail, and God eternal.


   Our God, our help in ages past,

   Our hope for years to come,

   Our shelter from the stormy blast,

   And our eternal home.


   Under the shadow of thy throne

   Thy saints have dwelt secure;

   Sufficient is thine arm alone,

   And our defence is sure.


   Before the hills in order stood,

   Or earth received her frame,

   From everlasting thou art God,

   To endless years the same.


   Thy word commands our flesh to dust,

   "Return, ye sons of men:"

   All nations rose from earth at first,

   And turn to earth again.


   A thousand ages in thy sight

   Are like an evening gone;

   Short as the watch that ends the night

   Before the rising sun.


   [The busy tribes of flesh and blood,

   With all their lives and cares,

   Are carried downwards by the flood,

   And lost in following years.


   Time, like an ever-rolling stream,

   Bears all its sons away;

   They fly, forgotten, as a dream

   Dies at the op'ning day.


   Like flowery fields the nations stand

   Pleased with the morning light;

   The flowers beneath the mower's hand

   Lie with'ring ere 'tis night.]


   Our God, our help in ages past,

   Our hope for years to come,

   Be thou our guard while troubles last,

   And our eternal home.

   Infirmities and mortality the effect of sin.


   Lord, if thine eye surveys our faults,

   And justice grows severe,

   Thy dreadful wrath exceeds our thoughts,

   And burns beyond our fear.


   Thine anger turns our frame to dust;

   By one offence to thee

   Adam with all his sons have lost

   Their immortality.


   Life, like a vain amusement, flies,

   A fable or a song;

   By swift degrees our nature dies,

   Nor can our joys be long.


   'Tis but a few whose days amount

   To threescore years and ten;

   And all beyond that short account

   Is sorrow, toil, and pain.


   [Our vitals with laborious strife

   Bear up the crazy load,

   And drag those poor remains of life

   Along the tiresome road.]


   Almighty God, reveal thy love,

   And not thy wrath alone;

   O let our sweet experience prove

   The mercies of thy throne!


   Our souls would learn the heav'nly art

   T' improve the hours we have,

   That we may act the wiser part,

   And live beyond the grave.

   Our absence from thy face?


   Let heav'n succeed our painful years,

   Let sin and sorrow cease,

   And in proportion to our tears

   So make our joys increase.


   Thy wonders to thy servants show,

   Make thy own work complete;

   Then shall our souls thy glory know,

   And own thy love was great.


   Then shall we shine before thy throne

   In all thy beauty, Lord;

   And the poor service we have done

   Meet a Divine reward.

   The frailty and shortness of life.


   Lord, what a feeble piece

   Is this our mortal frame!

   Our life how poor a trifle 'tis,

   That scarce deserves the name!


   Alas, the brittle clay

   That built our body first!

   And every month, and every day,

   'Tis mould'ring back to dust.


   Our moments fly apace,

   Nor will our minutes stay;

   Just like a flood, our hasty days

   Are sweeping us away.


   Well, if our days must fly,

   We'll keep their end in sight;

   We'll spend them all in wisdom's way,

   And let them speed their flight.


   They'll waft us sooner o'er

   This life's tempestuous sea;

   Soon we shall reach the peaceful shore

   Of blest eternity.

   Safety in public diseases and dangers.

   PAUSE.


   He that hath made his refuge God

   Shall find a most secure abode,

   Shall walk all day beneath his shade,

   And there at night shall rest his head.


   Then will I say, "My God, thy power

   Shall be my fortress and my tower;

   I, that am formed of feeble dust,

   Make thine almighty arm my trust."


   Thrice happy man! thy Maker's care

   Shall keep thee from the fowler's snare;

   Satan, the fowler, who betrays

   Unguarded souls a thousand ways.


   Just as a hen protects her brood

   From birds of prey that seek their blood,

   Under her feathers, so the Lord

   Makes his own arm his people's guard.


   If burning beams of noon conspire

   To dart a pestilential fire,

   God is their life; his wings are spread

   To shield them with a healthful shade.


   If vapors with malignant breath

   Rise thick, and scatter midnight death,

   Isr'el is safe; the poisoned air

   Grows pure, if Isr'el's God be there.


   What though a thousand at thy side,

   At thy right hand ten thousand died,

   Thy God his chosen people saves

   Amongst the dead, amidst the graves.


   So when he sent his angel down

   To make his wrath in Egypt known,

   And slew their sons, his careful eye

   Passed all the doors of Jacob by.


   But if the fire, or plague, or sword,

   Receive commission from the Lord

   To strike his saints among the rest,

   Their very pains and deaths are blest.


   The sword, the pestilence, or fire,

   Shall but fulfil their best desire;

   From sins and sorrows set them free,

   And bring thy children, Lord, to thee.

   And try and trust his care.


   No ill shall enter where you dwell;

   Or if the plague come nigh,

   And sweep the wicked down to hell,

   'Twill raise his saints on high.


   He'll give his angels charge to keep

   Your feet in all their ways;

   To watch your pillow while you sleep,

   And guard your happy days.


   Their hands shall bear you, lest you fall

   And dash against the stones:

   Are they not servants at his call,

   And sent t' attend his sons?


   Adders and lions ye shall tread;

   The tempter's wiles defeat;

   He that hath broke the serpent's head

   Puts him beneath your feet.


   "Because on me they set their love,

   I'll save them," saith the Lord;

   "I'll bear their joyful souls above

   Destruction and the sword.


   "My grace shall answer when they call,

   In trouble I'll be nigh;

   My power shall help them when they fall,

   And raise them when they die.

   Sweet is the day of sacred rest,

   No mortal cares shall seize my breast;

   O may my heart in tune be found,

   Like David's harp of solemn sound!


   My heart shall triumph in my Lord,

   And bless his works, and bless his word;

   Thy works of grace, how bright they shine!

   How deep thy counsels! how divine!


   Fools never raise their thoughts so high;

   Like brutes they live, like brutes they die;

   Like grass they flourish, till thy breath

   Blast them in everlasting death.


   But I shall share a glorious part

   When grace hath well refined my heart;

   And fresh supplies of joy are shed,

   Like holy oil, to cheer my head.


   Sin (my worst enemy before)

   Shall vex my eyes and ears no more;

   My inward foes shall all be slain,

   Nor Satan break my peace again.


   Then shall I see, and hear, and know

   His wrath shall pierce their souls with pain

   In some surprising hour.


   But if thy saints deserve rebuke,

   Thou hast a gentler rod;

   Thy providences and thy book

   Shall make them know their God.


   Blest is the man thy hands chastise,

   And to his duty draw;

   Thy scourges make thy children wise

   When they forget thy law.


   But God will ne'er cast off his saints,

   Nor his own promise break

   He pardons his inheritance

   For their Redeemer's sake.

   C. M.

   God our support and comfort.


   Who will arise and plead my right

   Against my num'rous foes,

   While earth and hell their force unite,

   And all my hopes oppose?


   Had not the Lord, my rock, my help,

   Sustained my fainting head,

   My life had now in silence dwelt,

   My soul amongst the dead.


   "Alas! my sliding feet!" I cried;

   Thy promise was my prop;

   Thy grace stood constant by my side,

   Thy Spirit bore me up.


   While multitudes of mournful thoughts

   Within my bosom roll,

   Thy boundless love forgives my faults,

   Thy comforts cheer my soul.


   Powers of iniquity may rise,

   And frame pernicious laws;

   But God my refuge rules the skies,

   He will defend my cause.


   Let malice vent her rage aloud,

   Let bold blasphemers scoff;

   The Lord our God shall judge the proud

   And cut the sinners off.

  PSALM 95

   C. M.

   A Psalm before prayer.


   Sing to the Lord Jehovah's name,

   And in his strength rejoice;

   When his salvation is our theme,

   Exalted be our voice.


   With thanks approach his awful sight,

   And psalms of honor sing;

   The Lord's a God of boundless might,

   The whole creation's King.


   Let princes hear, let angels know,

   How mean their natures seem,

   Those gods on high and gods below,

   When once compared with him.


   Earth, with its caverns dark and deep,

   Lies in his spacious hand;

   He fixed the seas what bounds to keep,

   And where the hills must stand.


   Come, and with humble souls adore,

   Come, kneel before his face

   O may the creatures of his power

   Be children of his grace!


   Now is the time; he bends his ear,

   And waits for your request;

   Come, lest he rouse his wrath and swear,

   "Ye shall not see my rest."

  PSALM 95

   S. M.

   A Psalm before sermon.


   Come, sound his praise abroad,

   And hymns of glory sing;

   Jehovah is the sovereign God,

   The universal King.


   He formed the deeps unknown;

   He gave the seas their bound;

   The wat'ry worlds are all his own,

   And all the solid ground.


   Come, worship at his throne;

   Come, bow before the Lord:

   We are his works, and not our own;

   He formed us by his word.


   Today attend his voice,

   Nor dare provoke his rod;

   Come, like the people of his choice,

   And own your gracious God.


   But if your ears refuse

   The language of his grace,

   And hearts grow hard, like stubborn Jews,

   That unbelieving race;


   The Lord, in vengeance dressed,

   Will lift his hand and swear,

   "You that despise my promised rest

   Shall have no portion there."

  PSALM 95

   v.1-3,6-11

   L. M.

   Canaan lost through unbelief; or, A warning to delaying sinners.


   Come, let our voices join to raise

   A sacred song of solemn praise;

   God is a sovereign King, rehearse

   His honors in exalted verse.


   Come, let our souls address the Lord,

   Who framed our natures with his word;

   He is our Shepherd; we the sheep

   His mercy chose, his pastures keep.


   Come, let us hear his voice today,

   The counsels of his love obey;

   Nor let our hardened hearts renew

   The sins and plagues that Isr'el knew.


   Isr'el, that saw his works of grace,

   Yet tempt their Maker to his face;

   A faithless, unbelieving brood,

   That tired the patience of their God.


   Thus saith the Lord: "How false they prove

   Forget my power, abuse my love!

   Since they despise my rest, I swear,

   Their feet shall never enter there."


   [Look back, my soul, with holy dread,

   And view those ancient rebels dead;

   Attend the offered grace today,

   Nor lose the blessing by delay.


   Seize the kind promise while it waits,

   And march to Zion's heav'nly gates:

   Believe, and take the promised rest;

   Obey, and be for ever blest.]

   Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands,

   Ye tribes of every tongue;

   His new-discovered grace demands

   A new and nobler song.


   Say to the nations, Jesus reigns,

   God's own almighty Son;

   His power the sinking world sustains,

   And grace surrounds his throne.


   Let heav'n proclaim the joyful day,

   Joy through the earth be seen;

   Let cities shine in bright array,

   And fields in cheerful green.


   Let an unusual joy surprise

   The islands of the sea:

   Ye mountains, sink; ye valleys, rise;

   Prepare the Lord his way.


   Behold, he comes, he comes to bless

   The nations as their God;

   To show the world his righteousness,

   And send his truth abroad.


   But when his voice shall raise the dead,

   And bid the world draw near,

   How will the guilty nations dread

   To see their Judge appear!

   To sing the choicest psalm of praise,

   To sing and bless Jehovah's name:

   His glory let the heathens know,

   His wonders to the nations show,

   And all his saving works proclaim.


   The heathens know thy glory, Lord,

   The wond'ring nations read thy word,

   In Britain is Jehovah known:

   Our worship shall no more be paid

   To gods which mortal hands have made;

   Our Maker is our God alone.


   He framed the globe, he built the sky,

   He made the shining worlds on high,

   And reigns complete in glory there:

   His beams are majesty and light;

   His beauties, how divinely bright!

   His temple, how divinely fair!


   Come the great day, the glorious hour,

   When earth shall feel his saving power,

   And barb'rous nations fear his name;

   Then shall the race of man confess

   The beauty of his holiness,

   And in his courts his grace proclaim.

   Praise him in evangelic strains

   Let the whole earth in songs rejoice,

   And distant islands join their voice.


   Deep are his counsels, and unknown,

   But grace and truth support his throne;

   Though gloomy clouds his ways surround,

   Justice is their eternal ground.


   In robes of judgment, lo! he comes,

   Shakes the wide earth and cleaves the tombs;

   Before him burns devouring fire;

   The mountains melt, the seas retire.


   His enemies, with sore dismay,

   Fly from the sight, and shun the day;

   Then lift your heads, ye saints, on high,

   And sing, for your redemption's nigh.

   Of eastern sages to their God.


   All ye bright armies of the skies,

   Angels and kings before him bow,

   Those gods on high and gods below.

   His dwelling is the mercy-seat.


   O ye that love his holy name,

   Hate every work of sin and shame;

   He guards the souls of all his friends,

   Immortal light and joys unknown

   Are for the saints in darkness sown

   Those glorious seeds shall spring and rise,

   And the bright harvest bless our eyes.

   His word, like fire, prepares his way,

   And mountains melt to plains.


   His presence sinks the proudest hills,

   And makes the valleys rise;

   The humble soul enjoys his smiles,

   The haughty sinner dies.


   The heav'ns his rightful power proclaim,

   The idol-gods around

   Fill their own worshippers with shame,

   And totter to the ground.


   Adoring angels at his birth

   Make the Redeemer known:

   Thus shall he come to judge the earth,

   His foes shall tremble at his sight,

   And hills and seas retire;

   His children take their unknown flight,

   And leave the world in fire.

   Shall rise and spring in worlds unknown,

   And heav'n and nature sing.


   Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns!

   Let men their songs employ,

   While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,

   Repeat the sounding joy.


   No more let sins and sorrows grow,

   Nor thorns infest the ground;

   When Isr'el was his church,

   When Aaron was his priest,

   When Moses cried, when Samuel prayed,

   He gave his people rest.


   Oft he forgave their sins,

   Nor would destroy their race;

   And oft he made his vengeance known,

   When they abused his grace.


   Exalt the Lord our God,

   Whose grace is still the same;

   Still he's a God of holiness,

   And jealous for his name.

   The Lord is God; 'tis he alone

   Doth life, and breath, and being give;

   The sheep that on his pastures live.


   Enter his gates with songs of joy,

   With praises to his courts repair;

   And make it your divine employ

   To pay your thanks and honors there.


   The Lord is good, the Lord is kind,

   Great is his grace, his mercy sure;

   And the whole race of man shall find

   His truth from age to age endure.

   Sing to the Lord with joyful voice,

   Let every land his name adore;

   The British isles shall send the noise

   Across the ocean to the shore.


   Nations, attend before his throne

   With solemn fear, with sacred joy;

   Know that the Lord is God alone;

   He can create and he destroy.


   His sovereign power, without our aid,

   Made us of clay and formed us men;

   And when, like wand'ring sheep, we strayed,

   He brought us to his fold again.


   We are his people, we his care,

   Our souls and all our mortal frame:

   What lasting honors shall we rear,

   Almighty Maker, to thy name?


   We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,

   High as the heav'ns our voices raise;

   And earth with her ten thousand tongues

   Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.


   Wide as the world is thy command,

   Vast as eternity thy love!

   Firm as a rock thy truth must stand,

   When rolling years shall cease to move.

   The magistrate's Psalm.


   Mercy and judgment are my song;

   And since they both to thee belong,

   My gracious God, my righteous King,

   To thee my songs and vows I bring.


   If I am raised to bear the sword,

   I'll take my counsels from thy word;

   Thy justice and thy heav'nly grace

   Shall be the pattern of my ways.


   Let wisdom all my actions guide,

   And let my God with me reside;

   No wicked thing shall dwell with me

   Which may provoke thy jealousy.


   No sons of slander, rage, and strife

   Shall be companions of my life;

   The haughty look, the heart of pride,

   Within my doors shall ne'er abide.


   [I'll search the land, and raise the just

   To posts of honor, wealth, and trust;

   The men that work thy holy will

   Shall be my friends and fav'rites still.]


   In vain shall sinners hope to rise

   By flatt'ring or malicious lies;

   And while the innocent I guard,

   The bold offender sha'n't be spared.


   The impious crew, that factious band,

   Shall hide their heads or quit the land;

   And all that break the public rest,

   Where I have power, shall be suppressed.

   Of justice and of grace I sing,

   And pay my God my vows;

   Thy grace and justice, heav'nly King,

   Teach me to rule my house.


   Now to my tent, O God, repair,

   And make thy servant wise;

   I'll suffer nothing near me there

   That shall offend thine eyes.


   The man that doth his neighbor wrong

   By falsehood or by force,

   The scornful eye, the sland'rous tongue

   I'll thrust them from my doors.


   I'll seek the faithful and the just,

   And will their help enjoy;

   These are the friends that I shall trust,

   The servants I'll employ.


   The wretch that deals in sly deceit

   I'll not endure a night:

   The liar's tongue I ever hate,

   And banish from my sight.


   I'll purge my family around,

   And make the wicked flee;

   So shall my house be ever found

   A dwelling fit for thee.

  PSALM 102 PART 1

   v.1-13,20,21

   C. M.

   A prayer of the afflicted.


   Hear me, O God, nor hide thy face;

   But answer, lest I die;

   Hast thou not built a throne of grace

   To hear when sinners cry?


   My days are wasted like the smoke

   Dissolving in the air;

   My strength is dried, my heart is broke,

   And sinking in despair.


   My spirits flag like with'ring grass

   Burnt with excessive heat;

   In secret groans my minutes pass,

   And I forget to eat.


   As on some lonely building's top

   The sparrow tells her moan,

   Far from the tents of joy and hope

   I sit and grieve alone.


   My soul is like a wilderness,

   Where beasts of midnight howl;

   There the sad raven finds her place,

   And there the screaming owl.


   Dark, dismal thoughts, and boding fears,

   Dwell in my troubled breast;

   While sharp reproaches wound my ears,

   Nor give my spirit rest.


   My cup is mingled with my woes,

   And tears are my repast;

   My daily bread, like ashes, grows

   Unpleasant to my taste.


   Sense can afford no real joy

   To souls that feel thy frown;

   Lord, 'twas thy hand advanced me high,

   Thy hand hath cast me down.


   My looks like withered leaves appear;

   And life's declining light

   Grows faint as evening shadows are

   That vanish into night.


   But thou for ever art the same,

   O my eternal God;

   Ages to come shall know thy name,

   And spread thy works abroad.


   Thou wilt arise and show thy face,

   Nor will my Lord delay

   Beyond th' appointed hour of grace,

   That long-expected day.


   He hears his saints, he knows their cry,

   And by mysterious ways

   Redeems the pris'ners doomed to die,

   And fills their tongues with praise.

   Prayer heard, and Zion restored.


   Let Zion and her sons rejoice,

   Behold the promised hour;

   Her God hath heard her mourning voice,

   And comes t' exalt his power.


   Her dust and ruins that remain

   Are precious in our eyes;

   Those ruins shall be built again,

   And all that dust shall rise.


   The Lord will raise Jerusalem

   And stand in glory there;

   Nations shall bow before his name,

   And kings attend with fear.


   He sits a sovereign on his throne,

   With pity in his eyes;

   He hears the dying pris'ners' groan,

   And sees their sighs arise.


   He frees the souls condemned to death,

   And when his saints complain,

   It shan't be said, "That praying breath

   Was ever spent in vain."


   This shall be known when we are dead,

   And left on long record;

   That ages yet unborn may read,

   And trust, and praise the Lord.

   Man's mortality, and Christ's eternity.


   It is the Lord our Savior's hand

   Weakens our strength amidst the race;

   Disease and death at his command

   Arrest us, and cut short our days.


   Spare us, O Lord, aloud we pray,

   Nor let our sun go down at noon;

   Thy years are one eternal day,

   And must thy children die so soon?


   Yet in the midst of death and grief

   This thought our sorrow should assuage:

   Our Father and our Savior live;

   Christ is the same through every age.


   'Twas he this earth's foundation laid;

   Heav'n is the building of his hand;

   This earth grows old, these heav'ns shall fade

   And all be changed at his command.


   The starry curtains of the sky,

   Like garments, shall be laid aside;

   But still thy throne stands firm on high,

   Thy church for ever must abide.


   Before thy face thy church shall live,

   And on thy throne thy children reign;

   This dying world shall they survive,

   And the dead saints be raised again.

   Blessing God for his goodness to soul and body.


   Bless, O my soul, the living God,

   Call home thy thoughts that rove abroad;

   Let all the powers within me join

   In work and worship so divine.


   Bless, O my soul, the God of grace;

   His favors claim thy highest praise:

   Why should the wonders he hath wrought

   Be lost in silence and forgot?


   'Tis he, my soul, that sent his Son

   To die for crimes which thou hast done;

   He owns the ransom, and forgives

   The hourly follies of our lives.


   The vices of the mind he heals,

   And cures the pains that nature feels

   Redeems the soul from hell, and saves

   Our wasting life from threat'ning graves.


   Our youth decayed, his power repairs;

   His mercy crowns our growing years;

   He satisfies our mouth with good,

   And fills our hopes with heav'nly food.


   He sees th' oppressor and th' oppressed,

   And often gives the suff'rers rest;

   But will his justice more display

   In the last great rewarding day.


   [His power he showed by Moses' hands,

   And gave to Isr'el his commands;

   But sent his truth and mercy down

   To all the nations by his Son.


   Let the whole earth his power confess,

   Let the whole earth adore his grace;

   The Gentile with the Jew shall join

   In work and worship so divine.]

  PSALM 103 PART 2

   v.8-18

   L. M.

   God's gentle chastisement; or, His tender mercy to his people.

   PAUSE.


   The Lord, how wondrous are his ways!

   How firm his truth! how large his grace!

   He takes his mercy for his throne,

   And thence he makes his glories known.


   Not half so high his power hath spread

   The starry heav'ns above our head,

   As his rich love exceeds our praise,

   Exceeds the highest hopes we raise.


   Not half so far hath nature placed

   The rising morning from the west,

   As his forgiving grace removes

   The daily guilt of those he loves.


   How slowly doth his wrath arise!

   On swifter wings salvation flies;

   And if he lets his anger burn,

   How soon his frowns to pity turn


   Amidst his wrath compassion shines;

   His strokes are lighter than our sins

   And while his rod corrects his saints,

   His ear indulges their complaints.


   So fathers their young sons chastise

   With gentle hand and melting eyes;

   The children weep beneath the smart,

   And move the pity of their heart.


   The mighty God, the wise and just,

   Knows that our frame is feeble dust;

   And will no heavy loads impose

   Beyond the strength that he bestows.


   He knows how soon our nature dies,

   Blasted by every wind that flies;

   Like grass we spring, and die as soon,

   Or morning flowers that fade at noon.


   But his eternal love is sure

   To all the saints, and shall endure;

   From age to age his truth shall reign,

   Nor children's children hope in vain.

   O bless the Lord, my soul,

   Nor let his mercies lie

   Forgotten in unthankfulness,

   And without praises die.


   'Tis he forgives thy sins,

   'Tis he relieves thy pain,

   'Tis he that heals thy sicknesses

   And makes thee young again.


   He crowns thy life with love,

   When ransomed from the grave;

   He that redeemed my soul from hell

   Hath sovereign power to save.


   He fills the poor with good,

   He gives the suff'rers rest;

   The Lord hath judgments for the proud,

   And justice for th' oppressed.


   His wondrous works and ways

   He made by Moses known

   But sent the world his truth and grace

   By his beloved Son.

  PSALM 103 PART 2

   S. M.

   Abounding compassion of God; or, Mercy in the midst of judgment.


   My soul, repeat his praise,

   Whose mercies are so great,

   Whose anger is so slow to rise,

   So ready to abate.


   God will not always chide;

   And when his strokes are felt,

   His strokes are fewer than our crimes,

   And lighter than our guilt.


   High as the heav'ns are raised

   Above the ground we tread,

   So far the riches of his grace

   Our highest thoughts exceed.


   His power subdues our sins,

   And his forgiving love

   Far as the east is from the west

   Doth all our guilt remove.


   The pity of the Lord,

   To those that fear his name,

   Is such as tender parents feel;

   He knows our feeble frame.


   He knows we are but dust,

   Scattered with every breath;

   His anger, like a rising wind,

   Can send us swift to death.


   Our days are as the grass,

   Or like the morning flower;

   If one sharp blast sweep o'er the field

   It withers in an hour.


   But thy compassions, Lord,

   To endless years endure;

   And children's children ever find

   Thy words of promise sure.

   God's universal dominion; or, Angels praise the Lord.


   The Lord, the sovereign King,

   Hath fixed his throne on high;

   O'er all the heav'nly world he rules,

   And all beneath the sky.


   Ye angels, great in might,

   And swift to do his will,

   Bless ye the Lord, whose voice ye hear,

   Whose pleasure ye fulfil.


   Let the bright hosts who wait

   The orders of their King,

   And guard his churches when they pray,

   Join in the praise they sing.


   While all his wondrous works

   Through his vast kingdom show

   Their Maker's glory, thou, my soul,

   Shalt sing his graces too.

  PSALM 104

   L. M.

   8,8,8,8,8,8

   The glory of God in creation and providence.

   PAUSE I.

   PAUSE II.

   PAUSE III.

   [Note.-This Psalm may be sung to the tune of the old 112th or 127th
   Psalm, by adding these two lines to every stanza:

   Otherwise it must be sung as the 100th Psalm.]


   My soul, thy great Creator praise:

   When clothed in his celestial rays,

   He in full majesty appears,

   And, like a robe, his glory wears.


   The heav'ns are for his curtains spread,

   The unfathomed deep he makes his bed.

   Clouds are his chariot when he flies

   On winged storms across the skies.


   Angels, whom his own breath inspires,

   His ministers, are flaming fires;

   And swift as thought their armies move

   To bear his vengeance or his love.


   The world's foundations by his hand

   Are poised, and shall for ever stand;

   He binds the ocean in his chain,

   Lest it should drown the earth again.


   When earth was covered with the flood,

   Which high above the mountains stood,

   He thundered, and the ocean fled,

   Confined to its appointed bed.


   The swelling billows know their bound,

   And in their channels walk their round;

   Yet thence conveyed by secret veins,

   They spring on hills and drench the plains.


   He bids the crystal fountains flow,

   And cheer the valleys as they go;

   Tame heifers there their thirst allay,

   And for the stream wild asses bray.


   From pleasant trees which shade the brink,

   The lark and linnet light to drink

   Their songs the lark and linnet raise,

   And chide our silence in his praise.


   God from his cloudy cistern pours

   On the parched earth enriching showers;

   The grove, the garden, and the field,

   A thousand joyful blessings yield.


   He makes the grassy food arise,

   And gives the cattle large supplies

   With herbs for man of various power,

   To nourish nature or to dire.


   What noble fruit the vines produce!

   The olive yields a shining juice;

   Our hearts are cheered with gen'rous wine,

   With inward joy our faces shine.


   O bless his name, ye Britons, fed

   With nature's chief supporter, bread;

   While bread your vital strength imparts,

   Serve him with vigor in your hearts.


   Behold, the stately cedar stands,

   Raised in the forest by his hands;

   Birds to the boughs for shelter fly,

   And build their nests secure on high.


   To craggy hills ascends the goat,

   And at the airy mountain's foot

   The feebler creatures make their cell;

   He gives them wisdom where to dwell.


   He sets the sun his circling race,

   Appoints the moon to change her face;

   And when thick darkness veils the day,

   Calls out wild beasts to hunt their prey.


   Fierce lions lead their young abroad,

   And, roaring, ask their meat from God;

   But when the morning beams arise,

   The savage beast to covert flies.


   Then man to daily labor goes;

   The night was made for his repose;

   Sleep is thy gift, that sweet relief

   From tiresome toil and wasting grief.


   How strange thy works! how great thy skill!

   And every land thy riches fill:

   Thy wisdom round the world we see;

   This spacious earth is full of thee.


   Nor less thy glories in the deep,

   Where fish in millions swim and creep

   With wondrous motions, swift or slow,

   Still wand'ring in the paths below.


   There ships divide their wat'ry way,

   And flocks of scaly monsters play;

   There dwells the huge leviathan,

   And foams and sports in spite of man.


   Vast are thy works, Almighty Lord;

   All nature rests upon thy word,

   And the whole race of creatures stands

   Waiting their portion from thy hands.


   While each receives his diff'rent food,

   Their cheerful looks pronounce it good:

   Eagles and bears, and whales and worms,

   Rejoice and praise in diff'rent forms.


   But when thy face is hid, they mourn,

   And, dying, to their dust return;

   Both man and beast their souls resign;

   Life, breath, and spirit, all is thine.


   Yet thou canst breathe on dust again,

   And fill the world with beasts and men;

   A word of thy creating breath

   Repairs the wastes of time and death.


   His works, the wonders of his might,

   Are honored with his own delight;

   How awful are his glorious ways!

   The Lord is dreadful in his praise.


   The earth stands trembling at thy stroke,

   And at thy touch the mountains smoke;

   Yet humble souls may see thy face,

   And tell their wants to sovereign grace.


   In thee my hopes and wishes meet,

   And make my meditations sweet;

   Thy praises shall my breath employ,

   Till it expire in endless joy.


   While haughty sinners die accursed,

   Their glory buried with their dust,

   I to my God, my heav'nly King,

   Immortal hallelujahs sing.


   Great is the Lord, what tongue can frame

   An equal honor to his name?

  PSALM 105 Abridged

   C. M.

   God's conduct of Israel, and the plagues of Egypt.

   PAUSE I.

   PAUSE II.


   Give thanks to God, invoke his name,

   And tell the world his grace;

   Sound through the earth his deeds of fame,

   That all may seek his face.


   His cov'nant, which he kept in mind

   For num'rous ages past,

   To num'rous ages yet behind

   In equal force shall last.


   He sware to Abraham and his seed,

   And made the blessing sure;

   Gentiles the ancient promise read,

   And find his truth endure.


   "Thy seed shall make all nations blest,"

   (Said the Almighty voice,)

   "And Canaan's land shall be their rest,

   The type of heav'nly joys."


   [How large the grant! how rich the grace,

   To give them Canaan's land,

   When they were strangers in the place,

   A little feeble band!


   Like pilgrims through the countries round

   Securely they removed;

   And haughty kings that on them frowned

   Severely he reproved.


   "Touch mine anointed, and my arm

   Shall soon revenge the wrong:

   The man that does my prophets harm,

   Shall know their God is strong."


   Then let the world forbear its rage,

   Nor put the church in fear;

   Isr'el must live through every age,

   And be th' Almighty's care.]


   When Pharaoh dared to vex the saints,

   And thus provoked their God,

   Moses was sent at their complaints,

   Armed with his dreadful rod.


   He called for darkness; darkness came

   Like an o'erwhelming flood;

   He turned each lake and every stream

   To lakes and streams of blood.


   He gave the sign, and noisome flies

   Through the whole country spread;

   And frogs in croaking armies rise

   About the monarch's bed.


   Through fields, and towns, and palaces,

   The tenfold vengeance flew;

   Locusts in swarms devoured their trees,

   And hail their cattle slew.


   Then by an angel's midnight stroke

   The flower of Egypt died;

   The strength of every house was broke,

   Their glory and their pride.


   Now let the world forbear its rage,

   Nor put the church in fear;

   Isr'el must live through every age,

   And be th' Almighty's care.


   Thus were the tribes from bondage brought,

   And left the hated ground;

   Each some Egyptian spoils had got,

   And not one feeble found.


   The Lord himself chose out their way,

   And marked their journeys right;

   Gave them a leading cloud by day,

   A fiery guide by night.


   They thirst, and waters from the rock

   In rich abundance flow;

   And following still the course they took,

   Ran all the desert through.


   O wondrous stream! O blessed type

   Of ever-flowing grace!

   So Christ, our Rock, maintains our life

   Through all this wilderness.


   Thus guarded by th' Almighty hand,

   The chosen tribes possessed

   Canaan, the rich, the promised land,

   And there enjoyed their rest.


   Then let the world forbear its rage,

   The church renounce her fear;

   Isr'el must live through every age,

   And be th' Almighty's care.

  PSALM 106 PART 1

   v.1-5

   L. M.

   Praise to God; or, Communion with saints.


   To God, the great, the ever-blest,

   Let songs of honor be addressed;

   His mercy firm for ever stands

   Give him the thanks his love demands.


   Who knows the wonders of thy ways?

   Who shall fulfil thy boundless praise?

   Blest are the souls that fear thee still,

   And pay their duty to thy will.


   Remember what thy mercy did

   For Jacob's race, thy chosen seed;

   And with the same salvation bless

   The meanest suppliant of thy grace.


   O may I see thy tribes rejoice,

   And aid their triumphs with my voice!

   This is my glory, Lord, to be

   Joined to thy saints, and near to thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 106 PART 2

   v.7,8,12ff

   S. M.

   Israel punished and pardoned; or, God's unchangeable love.


   God of eternal love,

   How fickle are our ways!

   And yet how oft did Isr'el prove

   Thy constancy of grace!


   They saw thy wonders wrought,

   And then thy praise they sung;

   But soon thy works of power forgot,

   And murmured with their tongue.


   Now they believe his word

   While rocks with rivers flow;

   Now with their lusts provoke the Lord,

   And he reduced them low.


   Yet when they mourned their faults,

   He hearkened to their groans,

   Brought his own cov'nant to his thoughts,

   And called them still his sons.


   Their names were in his book,

   He saved them from their foes

   Oft he chastised, but ne'er forsook

   The people that he chose.


   Let Isr'el bless the Lord,

   Who loved their ancient race

   And Christians join the solemn word,

   Amen, to all the praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 107 PART 1

   L. M.

   Israel led to Canaan, and Christians to heaven.


   Give thanks to God; he reigns above;

   Kind are his thoughts, his name is Love;

   His mercy ages past have known,

   And ages long to come shall own.


   Let the redeemed of the Lord

   The wonders of his grace record;

   Isr'el, the nation whom he chose,

   And rescued from their mighty foes.


   [When God's almighty arm had broke

   Their fetters and th' Egyptian yoke,

   They traced the desert, wand'ring round

   A wild and solitary ground.


   There they could find no leading road,

   Nor city for a fixed abode;

   Nor food, nor fountain, to assuage

   Their burning thirst or hunger's rage.]


   In their distress, to God they cried

   God was their Savior and their Guide;

   He led their march far wand'ring round,

   'Twas the right path to Canaan's ground.


   Thus, when our first release we gain

   From sin's old yoke, and Satan's chain,

   We have this desert world to pass,

   A dangerous and a tiresome place.


   He feeds and clothes us all the way,

   He guides our footsteps lest we stray,

   He guards us with a powerful hand,

   And brings us to the heav'nly land.


   O let the saints with joy record

   The truth and goodness of the Lord!

   How great his works! how kind his ways!

   Let every tongue pronounce his praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 107 PART 2

   L. M.

   Correction for sin, and release by prayer.


   From age to age exalt his name;

   God and his grace are still the same;

   He fills the hungry soul with food,

   And feeds the poor with every good.


   But if their hearts rebel and rise

   Against the God that rules the skies;

   If they reject his heav'nly word,

   And slight the counsels of the Lord


   He'll bring their spirits to the ground,

   And no deliv'rer shall be found;

   Laden with grief, they waste their breath

   In darkness and the shades of death.


   Then to the Lord they raise their cries;

   He makes the dawning light arise,

   And scatters all that dismal shade

   That hung so heavy round their head.


   He cuts the bars of brass in two,

   And lets the smiling pris'ners through;

   Takes off the load of guilt and grief,

   And gives the lab'ring soul relief.


   O may the sons of men record

   The wondrous goodness of the Lord

   How great his works! how kind his ways!

   Let every tongue pronounce his praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 107 PART 3

   L. M.

   Intemperance punished and pardoned.


   Vain man, on foolish pleasures bent,

   Prepares for his own punishment;

   What pains, what loathsome maladies,

   From luxury and lust arise!


   The drunkard feels his vitals waste,

   Yet drowns his health to please his taste;

   Till all his active powers are lost,

   And fainting life draws near the dust.


   The glutton groans, and loathes to eat,

   His soul abhors delicious meat;

   Nature, with heavy loads oppressed,

   Would yield to death to be released.


   Then how the frighted sinners fly

   To God for help with earnest cry!

   He hears their groans, prolongs their breath,

   And saves them from approaching death.


   No med'cines could effect the cure

   So quick, so easy, or so sure;

   The deadly sentence God repeals,

   He sends his sovereign word, and heals.


   O may the sons of men record

   The wondrous goodness of the Lord!

   And let their thankful off'rings prove

   How they adore their Maker's love

  PSALM 107 PART 4

   L. M.

   Deliverance from storms and shipwreck; or, The seaman's song.


   Would you behold the works of God,

   His wonders in the world abroad,

   Go with the mariners, and trace

   The unknown regions of the seas.


   They leave their native shores behind,

   And seize the favor of the wind;

   Till God command, and tempests rise

   That heave the ocean to the skies.


   Now to the heav'ns they mount amain,

   Now sink to dreadful deeps again;

   What strange affrights young sailors feel,

   And like a stagg'ring drunkard reel!


   When land is far, and death is nigh,

   Lost to all hope, to God they cry;

   His mercy hears the loud address,

   And sends salvation in distress.


   He bids the winds their wrath assuage,

   The furious waves forget their rage;

   'Tis calm, and sailors smile to see

   The haven where they wished to be.


   O may the sons of men record

   The wondrous goodness of the Lord!

   Let them their private off'rings bring,

   And in the church his glory sing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 107 PART 4

   C. M.

   The mariner's Psalm.


   Thy works of glory, mighty Lord,

   Thy wonders in the deeps,

   The sons of courage shall record

   Who trade in floating ships.


   At thy command the winds arise,

   And swell the towering waves;

   The men astonished mount the skies,

   And sink in gaping graves.


   [Again they climb the wat'ry hills,

   And plunge in deeps again;

   Each like a tott'ring drunkard reels,

   And finds his courage vain.


   Frighted to hear the tempest roar,

   They pant with flutt'ring breath;

   And hopeless of the distant shore,

   Expect immediate death.]


   Then to the Lord they raise their cries;

   He bears the loud request,

   And orders silence through the skies,

   And lays the floods to rest.


   Sailors rejoice to lose their fears,

   And see the storm allayed:

   Now to their eyes the port appears;

   There let their vows be paid.


   'Tis God that brings them safe to land;

   Let stupid mortals know

   That waves are under his command,

   And all the winds that blow.


   O that the sons of men would praise

   The goodness of the Lord!

   And those that see thy wondrous ways,

   Thy wondrous love record.

  PSALM 107 LAST PART

   L. M.

   Colonies planted; or, Nations blessed and punished.

   A Psalm for New England.


   When God, provoked with daring crimes,

   Scourges the madness of the times,

   He turns their fields to barren sand,

   And dries the rivers from the land.


   His word can raise the springs again,

   And make the withered mountains green;

   Send showery blessings from the skies,

   And harvests in the desert rise.


   [Where nothing dwelt but beasts of prey,

   Or men as fierce and wild as they,

   He bids th' oppressed and poor repair,

   And builds them towns and cities there.


   They sow the fields, and trees they plant,

   Whose yearly fruit supplies their want;

   Their race grows up from fruitful stocks,

   Their wealth increases with their flocks.


   Thus they are blessed; but if they sin,

   He lets the heathen nations in;

   A savage crew invades their lands,

   Their princes die by barb'rous hands.


   Their captive sons, exposed to scorn,

   Wander unpitied and forlorn;

   The country lies unfenced, untilled,

   And desolation spreads the field.


   Yet if the humbled nation mourns,

   Again his dreadful hand he turns;

   Again he makes their cities thrive,

   And bids the dying churches live.]


   The righteous, with a joyful sense,

   Admire the works of Providence;

   And tongues of atheists shall no more

   Blaspheme the God that saints adore.


   How few with pious care record

   These wondrous dealings of the Lord!

   But wise observers still shall find

   The Lord is holy, just, and kind.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 109

   v.1-5,31

   C. M.

   Love to enemies from the example of Christ.


   God of my mercy and my praise,

   Thy glory is my song,

   Though sinners speak against thy grace

   With a blaspheming tongue.


   When in the form of mortal man

   Thy Son on earth was found,

   With cruel slanders, false and vain,

   They compassed him around.


   Their miseries his compassion move,

   Their peace he still pursued;

   They render hatred for his love,

   And evil for his good.


   Their malice raged without a cause,

   Yet, with his dying breath,

   He prayed for murderers on his cross,

   And blessed his foes in death.


   Lord, shall thy bright example shine

   In vain before my eyes?

   Give me a soul akin to thine,

   To love my enemies.


   The Lord shall on my side engage,

   And, in my Savior's name,

   I shall defeat their pride and rage

   Who slander and condemn.

   "From Zion shall thy word proceed;

   Thy word, the sceptre in thy hand,

   Shall make the hearts of rebels bleed,

   And bow their wills to thy command.


   "That day shall show thy power is great,

   When saints shall flock with willing minds,

   And sinners crowd thy temple gate,

   "By me Melchizedek was made

   And thou, my King, shalt rule my sons.


   Jesus the Priest ascends his throne,

   While counsels of eternal peace,

   Between the Father and the Son,

   Proceed with honor and success.


   Through the whole earth his reign shall spread,

   And crush the powers that dare rebel;

   Then shall he judge the rising dead,

   And send the guilty world to hell.


   Though while he treads his glorious way,

   The suff'rings of that dreadful day

   Shall but advance him near to God.

   What wonders shall thy gospel do!

   Thy converts shall surpass

   The num'rous drops of morning dew,

   And own thy sovereign grace.


   God hath pronounced a firm decree,

   Nor changes what he swore:

   "Eternal shall thy priesthood be,

   When Aaron is no more.


   "Melchizedek, that wondrous priest,

   That king of high degree,

   That holy man who Abraham blessed,

   Jesus our Priest for ever lives

   To plead for us above;

   To spread his name abroad.


   How great the works his hand has wrought

   How glorious in our sight!

   And men in every age have sought

   His wonders with delight.


   How most exact is nature's frame!

   How wise th' Eternal mind!

   His counsels never change the scheme

   That his first thoughts designed.


   When he redeemed his chosen sons,

   He fixed his cov'nant sure;

   The orders that his lips pronounce

   To endless years endure.


   Nature and time, and earth and skies,

   Thy heav'nly skill proclaim;

   What shall we do to make us wise,

   But learn to read thy name?


   To fear thy power, to trust thy grace,

   Is our divinest skill;

   That best obeys thy will.

   Great is the mercy of the Lord;

   He gives his children food;

   And, ever mindful of his word,

   He makes his promise good.


   His Son, the great Redeemer, came

   To seal his cov'nant sure;

   Holy and reverend is his name,

   His ways are just and pure.


   They that would grow divinely wise

   Must with his fear begin;

   Our fairest proof of knowledge lies

   In hating every sin.

  PSALM 112

   8,8,8,8,8,8

   The blessings of the liberal man.

   PAUSE.


   That man is blest who stands in awe

   Of God, and loves his sacred law:

   His seed on earth shall be renowned;

   His house the seat of wealth shall be,

   An inexhausted treasury,

   And with successive honors crowned.


   His lib'ral favors he extends,

   To some he gives, to others lends;

   A gen'rous pity fills his mind:

   Yet what his charity impairs,

   He saves by prudence in affairs

   And thus he's just to all mankind.


   His hands, while they his alms bestowed,

   His glory's future harvest sowed;

   The sweet remembrance of the just,

   Like a green root, revives and bears

   A train of blessings for his heirs,

   When dying nature sleeps in dust.


   Beset with threat'ning dangers round,

   Unmoved shall he maintain his ground;

   His conscience holds his courage up:

   The soul that's filled with virtue's light,

   Shines brightest in affliction's night,

   And sees in darkness beams of hope.


   [Ill tidings never can surprise

   His heart that fixed on God relies,

   Though waves and tempests roar around:

   Safe on the rock he sits, and sees

   The shipwreck of his enemies,

   And all their hope and glory drowned.


   The wicked shall his triumph see,

   And gnash their teeth in agony,

   To find their expectations crossed;

   They and their envy, pride, and spite,

   Sink down to everlasting night,

   And all their names in darkness lost.]

   Thrice happy man who fears the Lord,

   Loves his commands, and trusts his word;

   Honor and peace his days attend,

   And blessings to his seed descend.


   Compassion dwells upon his mind,

   To works of mercy still inclined;

   He lends the poor some present aid,

   Or gives them, not to be repaid.


   When times grow dark, and tidings spread

   That fill his neighbors round with dread,

   His heart is armed against the fear,

   For God with all his power is there.


   His soul, well fixed upon the Lord,

   Draws heav'nly courage from his word;

   Amidst the darkness light shall rise,

   To cheer his heart and bless his eyes.


   He hath dispersed his alms abroad;

   His works are still before his God;

   His name on earth shall long remain,

   While envious sinners fret in vain.

   To all the sons of need;

   So God shall answer his request

   With blessings on his seed.


   No evil tidings shall surprise

   His well-established mind;

   His soul to God his refuge flies,

   And leaves his fears behind.


   In times of general distress

   Some beams of light shall shine,

   To show the world his righteousness,

   And give him peace divine.


   His works of piety and love

   Remain before the Lord;

   Honor on earth and joys above

   Shall be his sure reward.

   8,8,8,8,8,8

   Proper tune.

   The majesty and condescension of God.


   Ye that delight to serve the Lord,

   The honors of his name record,

   His sacred name for ever bless;

   Where'er the circling sun displays

   His rising beams, or setting rays,

   Let lands and seas his power confess.


   Not time, nor nature's narrow rounds,

   Can give his vast dominion bounds,

   The heav'ns are far below his height:

   Let no created greatness dare

   With our eternal God compare,

   Armed with his uncreated might.


   He bows his glorious head to view

   What the bright hosts of angels do,

   And bends his care to mortal things;

   His sovereign hand exalts the poor,

   He takes the needy from the door,

   And makes them company for kings.


   When childless families despair,

   He sends the blessing of an heir,

   To rescue their expiring name;

   The mother, with a thankful voice,

   Proclaims his praises and her joys:

   Let every age advance his fame.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 113

   L. M.

   God sovereign and gracious.


   Ye servants of th' Almighty King,

   In every age his praises sing;

   Where'er the sun shall rise or set,

   The nations shall his praise repeat.


   Above the earth, beyond the sky,

   Stands his high throne of majesty;

   Nor time nor place his power restrain,

   Nor bound his universal reign.


   Which of the sons of Adam dare,

   Or angels, with their God compare?

   His glories how divinely bright,

   Who dwells in uncreated light!


   Behold his love! he stoops to view

   What saints above and angels do;

   And condescends yet more to know

   The mean affairs of men below.


   From dust and cottages obscure,

   His grace exalts the humble poor;

   Gives them the honor of his sons,

   And fits them for their heav'nly thrones.


   [A word of his creating voice

   Can make the barren house rejoice;

   Though Sarah's ninety years were past,

   The promised seed is born at last.


   With joy the mother views her son,

   And tells the wonders God has done:

   Faith may grow strong when sense despairs,

   If nature fails, the promise bears.]

   Miracles attending Israel's journey.


   When Isr'el, freed from Pharaoh's hand,

   Left the proud tyrant and his land,

   The tribes with cheerful homage own

   Their King, and Judah was his throne.


   Across the deep their journey lay;

   The deep divides to make them way;

   Jordan beheld their march, and fled

   With backward current to his head.


   The mountains shook like frighted sheep,

   Like lambs the little hillocks leap;

   Not Sinai on her base could stand,

   Conscious of sovereign power at hand.


   What power could make the deep divide?

   Make Jordan backward roll his tide?

   Why did ye leap, ye little hills?

   And whence the fright that Sinai feels?


   Let every mountain, every flood,

   Retire and know th' approaching God,

   The King of Isr'el: see him here;

   Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear.


   He thunders, and all nature mourns;

   The rock to standing pools he turns;

   Flints spring with fountains at his word,

   And fires and seas confess the Lord.

  PSALM 115

   L. M.

   The true God our refuge; or, Idolatry reproved.


   Not to ourselves, who are but dust,

   Not to ourselves is glory due,

   Eternal God, thou only just,

   Thou only gracious, wise, and true.


   Shine forth in all thy dreadful name;

   Why should a heathen's haughty tongue

   Insult us, and, to raise our shame,

   Say, "Where's the God you've served so long?"


   The God we serve maintains his throne

   Above the clouds, beyond the skies;

   Through all the earth his will is done;

   He knows our groans, he hears our cries.


   But the vain idols they adore

   Are senseless shapes of stone and wood;

   At best a mass of glitt'ring ore,

   A silver saint or golden god.


   [With eyes and ears they carve their head;

   Deaf are their ears, their eyes are blind;

   In vain are costly off'rings made,

   And vows are scattered in the wind.


   Their feet were never made to move,

   Nor hands to save when mortals pray;

   Mortals that pay them fear or love

   Seem to be blind and deaf as they.]


   O Isr'el! make the Lord thy hope,

   Thy help, thy refuge, and thy rest;

   The Lord shall build thy ruins up,

   And bless the people and the priest.


   The dead no more can speak thy praise,

   They dwell in silence and the grave;

   But we shall live to sing thy grace,

   And tell the world thy power to save.

   10,10,10,10,10,10

   To the tune of the 50th Psalm.

   Popish idolatry reproved.

   A Psalm for the Fifth of November.


   Not to our names, thou only just and true,

   Not to our worthless names is glory due;

   Thy power and grace, thy truth and justice, claim

   Immortal honors to thy sovereign name:

   Shine through the earth from heav'n, thy blest abode

   Nor let the heathens say, "And where's your God?"


   Heav'n is thine higher court, there stands thy throne,

   And through the lower worlds thy will is done;

   Our God framed all this earth, these heav'ns he spread;

   But fools adore the gods their hands have made:

   The kneeling crowd, with looks devout, behold

   Their silver saviors, and their saints of gold.


   [Vain are those artful shapes of eyes and ears;

   The molten image neither sees nor hears;

   Their hands are helpless, nor their feet can move,

   They have no speech, nor thought, nor power, nor love;

   Yet sottish mortals make their long complaints

   To their deaf idols and their moveless saints.


   The rich have statues well adorned with gold;

   The poor, content with gods of coarser mould,

   With tools of iron carve the senseless stock,

   Lopped from a tree, or broken from a rock;

   People and priest drive on the solemn trade,

   And trust the gods that saws and hammers made.]


   Be heav'n and earth amazed! 'Tis hard to say

   Which is more stupid, or their gods or they:

   O Isr'el, trust the Lord; he hears and sees,

   He knows thy sorrows and restores thy peace;

   His worship does a thousand comforts yield,

   He is thy help, and he thy heav'nly shield.


   O Britain, trust the Lord: thy foes in vain

   Attempt thy ruin, and oppose his reign;

   Had they prevailed, darkness had closed our days,

   And death and silence had forbid his praise:

   But we are saved, and live; let songs arise,

   And Britain bless the God that built the skies.

   Recovery from sickness.


   I love the Lord; he heard my cries,

   And pitied every groan;

   Long as I live, when troubles rise,

   I'll hasten to his throne.


   I love the Lord; he bowed his ear,

   And chased my griefs away;

   O let my heart no more despair,

   While I have breath to pray!


   My flesh declined, my spirits fell,

   And I drew near the dead;

   While inward pangs and fears of hell

   Perplexed my wakeful head.


   "My God," I cried, "thy servant save,

   "Thou ever good and just;

   Thy power can rescue from the grave,

   Thy power is all my trust."


   The Lord beheld me sore distressed,

   He bid my pains remove

   Return, my soul, to God thy rest,

   For thou hast known his love.


   My God hath saved my soul from death,

   And dried my falling tears;

   Now to his praise I'll spend my breath,

   Among the saints that fill thine house

   My off'rings shall be paid;

   There shall my zeal perform the vows

   My soul in anguish made.


   How much is mercy thy delight,

   Thou ever-blessed God!

   How dear thy servants in thy sight!

   How precious is their blood!


   How happy all thy servants are!

   How great thy grace to me!

   My life, which thou hast made thy care,

   Lord, I devote to thee.


   Now I am thine, for ever thine,

   Nor shall my purpose move

   Thy hand hath loosed my bonds of pain,

   And bound me with thy love.

   Since heav'n affords its aid.


   'Tis safer, Lord, to hope in thee,

   And have my God my friend,

   Than trust in men of high degree,

   And on their truth depend.


   Like bees, my foes beset me round,

   A large and angry swarm;

   But I shall all their rage confound

   By thine almighty arm.


   'Tis through the Lord my heart is strong,

   In him my lips rejoice;

   While his salvation is my song,

   How cheerful is my voice!


   Like angry bees, they girt me round;

   When God appears they fly;

   So burning thorns, with crackling sound,

   Make a fierce blaze and die.

   [I have collected and disposed the most useful verses of this Psalm
   under eighteen different heads, and formed a divine song on each of
   them, But the verses are much transposed to attain some degree of
   connection. In some places, among the words law, commands, judgments,
   testimonies, I have used gospel, word, grace, truth, promises, etc., as
   more agreeable to the New Testament and the common language of
   Christians, and it equally answers the design of the Psalmist, which

   But fly from every sin.


   Blest are the men that keep thy word,

   And practise thy commands;

   With their whole heart they seek the Lord,

   And serve thee with their hands.


   Great is their peace who love thy law;

   How firm their souls abide!

   Nor can a bold temptation draw

   Their steady feet aside.


   Then shall my heart have inward joy,

   And keep my face from shame,

   When all thy statutes I obey,

   And honor all thy name.


   But haughty sinners God will hate,

   The proud shall die accursed;

   The sons of falsehood and deceit

   Are trodden to the dust.


   Vile as the dross the wicked are;

   [In vain the proud deride me now;

   I'll ne'er forget thy law,

   Nor let that blessed gospel go,

   Whence all my hopes I draw.


   When I have learned my Father's will,

   I'll teach the world his ways;

   My thankful lips, inspired with zeal,

   Shall loud pronounce his praise.]

   Hast thou not writ salvation down,

   And promised quick'ning grace?

   He guides our feet, he guards our way;

   His morning smiles bless all the day;

   He spreads the evening veil, and keeps

   May rise secure, securely rest;

   Thy holy Guardian's wakeful eyes

   Shall blast thy couch; no baleful star

   Dart his malignant fire so far.


   Should earth and hell with malice burn,

   Still thou shalt go, and still return,

   Safe in the Lord; his heav'nly care

   Defends thy life from every snare.

   Nor scorching sun, nor sickly moon,

   Shall have his leave to smite;

   He shields thy head from burning noon,

   From blasting damps at night.


   He guards thy soul, he keeps thy breath,

   The church, adorned with grace,

   Up to her courts with joys unknown

   The holy tribes repair;

   The Son of David holds his throne,

   And sits in judgment there.


   He hears our praises and complaints;

   And while his awful voice

   Divides the sinners from the saints,

   We tremble and rejoice.


   Peace be within this sacred place,

   And joy a constant guest!

   With holy gifts and heav'nly grace

   Be her attendants blest!

   He sits for grace and judgment there:

   He bids the saint be glad,

   He makes the sinner sad,

   May peace attend thy gate,

   And joy within thee wait

   To bless the soul of every guest!

   The man that seeks thy peace,

   And wishes thine increase,

   Had not the Lord, may Isr'el say,

   Had not the Lord maintained our side,

   When men, to make our lives a prey,

   Rose like the swelling of the tide;


   The swelling tide had stopped our breath,

   So fiercely did the waters roll,

   We had been swallowed deep in death;

   Proud waters had o'erwhelmed our soul.


   We leap for joy, we shout and sing,

   Who just escaped the fatal stroke;

   So flies the bird with cheerful wing,

   When once the fowler's snare is broke.


   For ever blessed be the Lord,

   Who broke the fowler's cursed snare,

   Who saved us from the murd'ring sword,

   And made our lives and souls his care.


   Our help is in Jehovah's name,

   Who formed the earth and built the skies:

   He that upholds that wondrous frame

   Guards his own church with watchful eyes.

   Not walls nor hills could guard so well

   Old Salem's happy ground,

   As those eternal arms of love

   That every saint surround.


   While tyrants are a smarting scourge

   To drive them near to God,

   Divine compassion does allay

   The fury of the rod.


   Deal gently, Lord, with souls sincere,

   And lead them safely on

   To the bright gates of Paradise,

   Where Christ their Lord is gone.


   But if we trace those crooked ways

   That the old serpent drew,

   The wrath that drove him first to hell

   Shall smite his followers too.

   The city's sacred ground,

   So God and his almighty love

   Embrace his saints around.


   What though the Father's rod

   Drop a chastising stroke,

   Yet, lest it wound their souls too deep,

   Its fury shall be broke.


   Deal gently, Lord, with those

   Whose faith and pious fear,

   Whose hope, and love, and every grace,

   Proclaim their hearts sincere.


   Nor shall the tyrant's rage

   Too long oppress the saint;

   The God of Isr'el will support

   His children lest they faint.


   But if our slavish fear

   Will choose the road to hell,

   We must expect our portion there,

   Where bolder sinners dwell.

   When we review our dismal fears,

   'Twas hard to think they'd vanish so;

   With God we left our flowing tears,

   He makes our joys like rivers flow.


   The man that in his furrowed field

   His scattered seed with sadness leaves,

   Persecutors punished.


   Up from my youth, may Isr'el say,

   Have I been nursed in tears;

   My griefs were constant as the day,

   And tedious as the years.


   Up from my youth I bore the rage

   Of all the sons of strife;

   Oft they assailed my riper age,

   But not destroyed my life.


   Their cruel plow had torn my flesh

   With furrows long and deep;

   Hourly they vexed my wounds afresh,

   Nor let my sorrows sleep.


   The Lord grew angry on his throne,

   And, with impartial eye,

   Measured the mischiefs they had done,

   Then let his arrows fly.


   How was their insolence surprised

   To hear his thunders roll!

   And all the foes of Zion seized

   With horror to the soul!


   Thus shall the men that hate the saints

   Be blasted from the sky;

   Their glory fades, their courage faints

   And all their projects die.


   [What though they flourish tall and fair,

   They have no root beneath;

   Their growth shall perish in despair,

   And lie despised in death.]


   [So corn that on the house-top stands

   No hope of harvest gives;

   The reaper ne'er shall fill his hands,

   Nor binder fold the sheaves.


   It springs and withers on the place;

   No traveller bestows

   A word of blessing on the grass,

   Nor minds it as he goes.]

   No mortal flesh could stand.


   But there are pardons with my God

   For crimes of high degree;

   Thy Son has bought them with his blood,

   To draw us near to thee.


   [I wait for thy salvation, Lord,

   With strong desires I wait;

   My soul, invited by thy word,

   Stands watching at thy gate.]


   [Just as the guards that keep the night

   Long for the morning skies,

   Watch the first beams of breaking light,

   And meet them with their eyes;


   So waits my soul to see thy grace,

   And, more intent than they,

   Meets the first openings of thy face,

   And finds a brighter day.]


   [Then in the Lord let Isr'el trust,

   Let Isr'el seek his face;

   The Lord is good as well as just,

   And plenteous is his grace.


   There's full redemption at his throne

   For sinners long enslaved;

   The great Redeemer is his Son,

   And Isr'el shall be saved.]

   Pardoning grace.


   From deep distress and troubled thoughts

   To thee, my God, I raised my cries;

   If thou severely mark our faults,

   No flesh can stand before thine eyes.


   But thou hast built thy throne of grace

   Free to dispense thy pardons there,

   That sinners may approach thy face,

   And hope and love, as well as fear.


   As the benighted pilgrims wait,

   And long, and wish for breaking day,

   So waits my soul before thy gate;

   When will my God his face display?


   My trust is fixed upon thy word,

   Nor shall I trust thy word in vain;

   Let mourning souls address the Lord,

   And find relief from all their pain.


   Great is his love, and large his grace,

   Through the redemption of his Son;

   He turns our feet from sinful ways,

   And pardons what our hands have done.

   Humility and submission.


   Is there ambition in my heart?.

   Lord, I appeal to thee.


   I charge my thoughts, be humble still,

   And all my carriage mild,

   Content, my Father, with thy will,

   An habitation for our God,

   A dwelling for th' Eternal Mind,

   Among the sons of flesh and blood?


   The God of Jacob chose the hill

   Of Zion for his ancient rest;

   And Zion is his dwelling still,

   His church is with his presence blessed.


   Here will I fix my gracious throne,

   And reign for ever, saith the Lord;

   Here shall my power and love be known,

   And blessings shall attend my word.


   Here will I meet the hungry poor,

   And fill their souls with living bread;

   Sinners that wait before my door

   With sweet provision shall be fed.


   Girded with truth, and clothed with grace,

   My priests, my ministers, shall shine

   Not Aaron in his costly dress

   Made an appearance so divine.


   The saints, unable to contain

   Their inward joys, shall shout and sing;

   The Son of David here shall reign,

   And Zion triumph in her King.


   [Jesus shall see a num'rous seed

   Good David would afford,

   Till he had found below the skies

   A dwelling for the Lord.


   The Lord in Zion placed his name,

   His ark was settled there;

   To Zion the whole nation came

   To worship thrice a year.


   But we have no such lengths to go,

   Nor wander far abroad;

   Where'er thy saints assemble now,

   There is a house for God.]


   Arise, O King of grace, arise,

   And enter to thy rest!

   Lo! thy church waits with longing eyes

   Thus to be owned and blessed.


   Enter with all thy glorious train,

   Thy Spirit and thy word;

   All that the ark did once contain

   Could no such grace afford.


   Here, mighty God, accept our vows,

   Here let thy praise be spread;

   Bless the provisions of thy house,

   And fill thy poor with bread.


   Here let the Son of David reign,

   Let God's Anointed shine;

   Justice and truth his court maintain

   With love and power divine.


   Here let him hold a lasting throne;

   And as his kingdom grows,

   In bands of piety!


   When streams of love from Christ the spring

   Descend to every soul,

   And heav'nly peace, with balmy wing,

   Shades and bedews the whole;


   'Tis like the oil, divinely sweet,

   On Aaron's reverend head

   The trickling drops perfumed his feet,

   And o'er his garments spread.


   'Tis pleasant as the morning dews

   That fall on Zion's hill,

   Where zeal and friendship meet;

   Their songs of praise, their mingled vows,

   Make their communion sweet.


   Thus when on Aaron's head

   They poured the rich perfume,

   The oil through all his raiment spread,

   And pleasure filled the room.


   Thus on the heav'nly hills

   Kindred and friends agree;

   Each in their proper station move,

   And each fulfil their part,

   With sympathizing heart,

   In all the cares of life and love!


   'Tis like the ointment shed

   On Aaron's sacred head,

   Divinely rich, divinely sweet;

   The oil through all the room

   Diffused a choice perfume,

   Ran through his robes, and blessed his feet.


   Like fruitful showers of rain,

   That water all the plain,

   Descending from the neighboring hills;

   Such streams of pleasure roll

   Through every friendly soul,

   Where love, like heav'nly dew, distils.

   Lift up your hands by morning light,

   And send your souls on high;

   Raise your admiring thoughts by night

   While in his holy courts ye wait,

   Ye saints, that to his house belong,

   Or stand attending at his gate.


   Praise ye the Lord, the Lord is good;

   To praise his name is sweet employ:

   Isr'el he chose of old, and still

   His church is his peculiar joy.


   The Lord himself will judge his saints;

   He treats his servants as his friends;

   And when he hears their sore complaints,

   Repents the sorrows that he sends.


   Through every age the Lord declares

   His name, and breaks th' oppressor's rod

   He gives his suff'ring servants rest,

   Great is the Lord, exalted high

   Above all powers and every throne:

   Whate'er he please, in earth or sea,

   Or heav'n or hell, his hand hath done.


   At his command the vapors rise,

   The lightnings flash, the thunders roar;

   He pours the rain, he brings the wind

   And tempest from his airy store.


   'Twas he those dreadful tokens sent,

   O Egypt, through thy stubborn land,

   When all thy first-born, beasts and men,

   Fell dead by his avenging hand.


   What mighty nations, mighty kings,

   He slew, and their whole country gave

   To Isr'el, whom his hand redeemed,

   No more to be proud Pharaoh's slave!


   His power the same, the same his grace,

   That saves us from the hosts of hell;

   And heav'n he gives us to possess,

   Whence those apostate angels fell.

   Your pious pleasure, while you sing,

   Increasing with the praise.


   Great is the Lord, and works unknown

   Are his divine employ;

   But still his saints are near his throne,

   His treasure and his joy.


   Heav'n, earth, and sea confess his hand;

   He bids the vapors rise;

   Lightning and storm at his command

   Sweep through the sounding skies.


   All power that gods or kings have claimed

   Is found with him alone

   But heathen gods should ne'er be named

   Where our Jehovah's known.


   Which of the stocks or stones they trust

   Can give them showers of rain?

   In vain they worship glitt'ring dust,

   And pray to gold in vain.


   [Their gods have tongues that cannot talk,

   Such as their makers gave;

   Their feet were ne'er designed to walk,

   Nor hands have power to save.


   Blind are their eyes, their ears are deaf,

   Nor hear when mortals pray;

   Mortals that wait for their relief

   Are blind and deaf as they.]


   O Britain, know thy living God,

   Serve him with faith and fear;

   He makes thy churches his abode,

   And claims thine honors there.

   How gracious is our God!


   He cleft the swelling sea in two;

   His arm is great in might;

   And gave the tribes a passage through;

   His power and grace unite.


   But Pharaoh's army there he drowned;

   How glorious are his ways!

   And brought his saints through desert ground;

   Eternal be his praise!


   Great monarchs fell beneath his hand;

   Victorious is his sword;

   He saw the nations dead in sin;

   The all-seeing God.

   PAUSE I.

   PAUSE II.


   Lord, thou hast searched and seen me through,

   Thine eye commands with piercing view

   My rising and my resting hours,

   My heart and flesh with all their powers.


   My thoughts, before they are my own,

   Are to my God distinctly known;

   He knows the words I mean to speak

   Ere from my op'ning lips they break.


   Within thy circling power I stand;

   On every side I find thy hand;

   Awake, asleep, at home, abroad,

   I am surrounded still with God.


   Amazing knowledge, vast and great!

   What large extent! what lofty height!

   My soul, with all the powers I boast,

   Is in the boundless prospect lost.


   O may these thoughts possess my breast,

   Where'er I rove, where'er I rest!

   Nor let my weaker passions dare

   Consent to sin, for God is there.


   Could I so false, so faithless prove,

   To quit thy service and thy love,

   Where, Lord, could I thy presence shun.

   Or from thy dreadful glory run?


   If up to heav'n I take my flight,

   'Tis there thou dwell'st enthroned in light

   Or dive to hell, there vengeance reigns,

   And Satan groans beneath thy chains.


   If, mounted on a morning ray,

   I fly beyond the western sea,

   Thy swifter hand would first arrive,

   And there arrest thy fugitive.


   Or should I try to shun thy sight

   Beneath the spreading veil of night,

   One glance of thine, one piercing ray,

   Would kindle darkness into day.


   O may these thoughts possess my breast,

   Where'er I rove, where'er I rest!

   Nor let my weaker passions dare

   Consent to sin, for God is there.


   The veil of night is no disguise,

   No screen from thy all-searching eyes;

   Thy hand can seize thy foes as soon

   Through midnight shades as blazing noon.


   Midnight and noon in this agree,

   Great God, they're both alike to thee;

   Not death can hide what God will spy,

   And hell lies naked to his eye.


   O may these thoughts possess my breast,

   Where'er I rove, where'er I rest!

   Nor let my weaker passions dare

   'Twas from thy hand, my God, I came,

   A work of such a curious frame

   In me thy fearful wonders shine,

   And each proclaims thy skill divine.


   Thine eyes did all my limbs survey,

   Which yet in dark confusion lay;

   Thou saw'st the daily growth they took,

   Formed by the model of thy book.


   By thee my growing parts were named,

   And what thy sovereign counsels framed-

   The breathing lungs, the beating heart-

   Was copied with unerring art.


   At last, to show my Maker's name,

   God stamped his image on my frame,

   And in some unknown moment joined

   The finished members to the mind.


   There the young seeds of thought began,

   And all the passions of the man:

   Great God, our infant nature pays

   Immortal tribute to thy praise.


   Lord, since in my advancing age

   I've acted on life's busy stage,

   Thy thoughts of love to me surmount

   The power of numbers to recount.


   I could survey the ocean o'er,

   And count each sand that makes the shore,

   Before my swiftest thoughts could trace

   The num'rous wonders of thy grace.


   These on my heart are still impressed,

   Does not my soul detest and hate

   Those that oppose thy laws and thee,

   I count them enemies to me.


   Lord, search my soul, try every thought;

   Though my own heart accuse me not

   Of walking in a false disguise,

   I beg the trial of thine eyes.


   Doth secret mischief lurk within?

   Thy all-surrounding sight surveys

   My rising and my rest,

   My public walks, my private ways,

   And secrets of my breast.


   My thoughts lie open to the Lord

   Before they're formed within;

   And ere my lips pronounce the word

   He knows the sense I mean.


   O wondrous knowledge, deep and high!

   Where can a creature hide?

   Within thy circling arms I lie,

   Beset on every side.


   So let thy grace surround me still,

   And like a bulwark prove,

   To guard my soul from every ill,

   Secured by sovereign love.


   Lord, where shall guilty souls retire,

   Forgotten and unknown?

   In hell they meet thy dreadful fire,

   In heav'n thy glorious throne.


   Should I suppress my vital breath

   To 'scape the wrath divine,

   Thy voice would break the bars of death,

   And make the grave resign.


   If winged with beams of morning light

   I fly beyond the west,

   Thy hand, which must support my flight,

   Would soon betray my rest.


   If o'er my sins I think to draw

   The curtains of the night,

   Those flaming eyes that guard thy law

   Would turn the shades to light.


   The beams of noon, the midnight hour,

   Are both alike to thee

   O may I ne'er provoke that power

   From which I cannot flee.

   God is the hope of the helpless.


   To God I made my sorrows known,

   From God I sought relief;

   In long complaints before his throne

   I poured out all my grief.


   My soul was overwhelmed with woes,

   My heart began to break;

   My God, who all my burden knows,

   He knows the way I take.


   On every side I cast mine eye,

   And found my helpers gone;

   While friends and strangers passed me by,

   Neglected or unknown.


   Then did I raise a louder cry,

   And called thy mercy near,-

   "Thou art my portion when I die;

   Be thou my refuge here."


   Lord, I am brought exceeding low,

   Now let thine ear attend,

   And make my foes who vex me know

   I've an almighty Friend.


   From my sad prison set me free,

   Then shall I praise thy name,

   And holy men shall join with me

   Thy kindness to proclaim.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PSALM 143

   L. M.

   Complaint of heavy afflictions in mind and body.


   My righteous Judge, my gracious God,

   Hear when I spread my hands abroad,

   And cry for succor from thy throne;

   O make thy truth and mercy known!


   Let judgment not against me pass;

   Behold, thy servant pleads thy grace:

   Should justice call us to thy bar,

   No man alive is guiltless there.


   Look down in pity, Lord, and see

   The mighty woes that burden me;

   Down to the dust my life is brought,

   Like one long buried and forgot.


   I dwell in darkness and unseen,

   My heart is desolate within

   My thoughts in musing silence trace

   The ancient wonders of thy grace.


   Thence I derive a glimpse of hope

   To bear my sinking spirits up;

   I stretch my hands to God again,

   And thirst like parched lands for rain


   For thee I thirst, I pray, I mourn:

   When will thy smiling face return?

   Shall all my joys on earth remove?

   And God for ever hide his love?


   My God, thy long delay to save

   Will sink thy pris'ner to the grave;

   My heart grows faint, and dim mine eye;

   Make haste to help before I die.


   The night is witness to my tears,

   Distressing pains, distressing fears;

   O might I hear thy morning voice,

   How would my wearied powers rejoice!


   In thee I trust, to thee I sigh,

   And lift my heavy soul on high;

   For thee sit waiting all the day,

   And wear the tiresome hours away.


   Break off my fetters, Lord, and show

   Which is the path my feet should go;

   If snares and foes beset the road,

   I flee to hide me near my God.


   Teach me to do thy holy will,

   And lead me to thy heav'nly hill;

   Let the good Spirit of thy love

   Conduct me to thy courts above.


   Then shall my soul no more complain,

   The tempter then shall rage in vain;

   And flesh, that was my foe before,

   Shall never vex my spirit more.

   Assistance and victory in the spiritual warfare.


   For ever blessed be the Lord,

   My Savior and my shield;

   He sends his Spirit with his word,

   To arm me for the field.


   When sin and hell their force unite,

   He makes my soul his care,

   Instructs me to the heav'nly fight,

   And guards me through the war.


   A friend and helper so divine

   He makes the glorious vict'ry mine,

   The vanity of man and condescension of God.


   Lord, what is man, poor feeble man,

   His life a shadow, light and vain,

   Still hasting to the dust.


   O what is feeble, dying man,

   Or any of his race,

   That God should make it his concern

   To visit him with grace?


   That God who darts his lightnings down,

   Who shakes the worlds above,

   And mountains tremble at his frown,

   How wondrous is his love!

   Grace above riches; or, The happy nation.


   Happy the city where their sons,

   Like pillars round a palace set,

   And daughters, bright as polished stones,

   Give strength and beauty to the state.


   Happy the country where the sheep,

   Cattle, and corn, have large increase;

   Where men securely work or sleep,

   Nor sons of plunder break the peace.


   Happy the nation thus endowed,

   On whom the all-sufficient God

   Himself with all his grace bestows.

   The wings of every hour shall bear

   Some thankful tribute to thine ear;

   And every setting sun shall see

   New works of duty done for thee.


   Thy truth and justice I'll proclaim;

   Thy bounty flows an endless stream;

   Thy mercy swift, thine anger slow,

   But dreadful to the stubborn foe.


   Thy works with sovereign glory shine,

   And speak thy majesty divine;

   Let Britain round her shores proclaim

   The sound and honor of thy name.


   Let distant times and nations raise

   The long succession of thy praise,

   And unborn ages make my song

   The joy and labor of their tongue.


   But who can speak thy wondrous deeds?

   Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds?

   Vast and unsearchable thy ways,

   Vast and immortal be thy praise!

   In the bright world above.


   Great is the Lord, his power unknown,

   I'll sing the honors of thy throne,

   Thy works of grace repeat.


   Thy grace shall dwell upon my tongue;

   And while my lips rejoice,

   The men that hear my sacred song

   Shall join their cheerful voice.


   Fathers to sons shall teach thy name,

   And children learn thy ways;

   Ages to come thy truth proclaim,

   And nations sound thy praise.


   Thy glorious deeds of ancient date

   Shall through the world be known;

   Thine arm of power, thy heav'nly state,

   In sounds of glory sing.


   God reigns on high, but not confines

   His goodness to the skies;

   Through the whole earth his bounty shines,

   And every want supplies.


   With longing eyes thy creatures wait

   On thee for daily food;

   Thy lib'ral hand provides their meat,

   And fills their mouths with good.


   How kind are thy compassions, Lord!

   How slow thine anger moves!

   But soon he sends his pard'ning word

   To cheer the souls he loves.


   Creatures with all their endless race

   Thy power and praise proclaim;

   Delight to bless thy name.

   Mercy to sufferers; or, God hearing prayer.


   Let every tongue thy goodness speak,

   Thou sovereign Lord of all;

   Thy strength'ning hands uphold the weak,

   And raise the poor that fall.


   When sorrow bows the spirit down,

   Or virtue lies distressed

   Beneath some proud oppressor's frown,

   Thou giv'st the mourners rest.


   The Lord supports our tott'ring days,

   And guides our giddy youth;

   Holy and just are all his ways,

   And all his words are truth.


   He knows the pains his servants feel,

   He hears his children cry,

   And their best wishes to fulfil,

   His grace is ever nigh.


   His mercy never shall remove

   From men of heart sincere;

   He saves the souls whose humble love

   Is joined with holy fear.


   [His stubborn foes his sword shall slay,

   And pierce their hearts with pain

   But none that serve the Lord shall say,

   "They sought his aid in vain."]

   Praise to God for his goodness and truth.


   Praise ye the Lord, my heart shall join

   In work so pleasant, so divine;

   Now, while the flesh is mine abode,

   And when my soul ascends to God.


   Praise shall employ my noblest powers,

   While immortality endures;

   My days of praise shall ne'er be past,

   While life, and thought, and being last.


   Why should I make a man my trust?

   Princes must die and turn to dust;

   Their breath departs, their pomp, and power,

   And thoughts, all vanish in an hour.


   Happy the man whose hopes rely

   On Isr'el's God; he made the sky,

   And earth, and seas, with all their train,

   And none shall find his promise vain.


   His truth for ever stands secure;

   He saves th' oppressed, he feeds the poor;

   He sends the lab'ring conscience peace,

   And grants the pris'ner sweet release.


   The Lord hath eyes to give the blind;

   The Lord supports the sinking mind;

   He helps the stranger in distress,

   The widow and the fatherless.


   He loves his saints, he knows them well,

   But turns the wicked down to hell:

   Praise shall employ my nobler powers

   My days of praise shall ne'er be past,

   While life, and thought, and being last,

   Why should I make a man my trust?

   Princes must die and turn to dust;

   Vain is the help of flesh and blood:

   Their breath departs, their pomp, and power,

   And thoughts, all vanish in an hour,

   Nor can they make their promise good.

   PAUSE.


   Praise ye the Lord; 'tis good to raise

   Our hearts and voices in his praise;

   His nature and his works invite

   To make this duty our delight.


   The Lord builds up Jerusalem,

   And gathers nations to his name;

   His mercy melts the stubborn soul,

   And makes the broken spirit whole.


   He formed the stars, those heav'nly flames;

   He counts their numbers, calls their names;

   His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound,

   A deep where all our thoughts are drowned.


   Great is our Lord, and great his might;

   And all his glories infinite:

   He crowns the meek, rewards the just,

   And treads the wicked to the dust.


   Sing to the Lord, exalt him high,

   Who spreads his clouds all round the sky;

   There he prepares the fruitful rain,

   Nor lets the drops descend in vain.


   He makes the grass the hills adorn,

   And clothes the smiling fields with corn;

   The beasts with food his hands supply,

   And the young ravens when they cry.


   What is the creature's skill or force,

   The sprightly man, the warlike horse,

   The nimble wit, the active limb?

   All are too mean delights for him.


   But saints are lovely in his sight,

   He views his children with delight;

   He sees their hope, he knows their fear,

   And looks, and loves his image there.

   Summer and winter.

   A Song for Great Britain.


   O Britain, praise thy mighty God,

   And make his honors known abroad,

   He bid the ocean round thee flow;

   Not bars of brass could guard thee so.


   Thy children are secure and blest;

   Thy shores have peace, thy cities rest;

   He feeds thy sons with finest wheat,

   And adds his blessing to their meat.


   Thy changing seasons he ordains,

   Thine early and thy latter rains;

   His flakes of snow like wool he sends,

   And thus the springing corn defends.


   With hoary frost he strews the ground;

   His hail descends with clatt'ring sound:

   Where is the man so vainly bold

   That dares defy his dreadful cold?


   He bids the southern breezes blow;

   The ice dissolves, the waters flow:

   But he hath nobler works and ways

   To call the Britons to his praise.


   To all the isle his laws are shown,

   His gospel through the nation known;

   He hath not thus revealed his word

   To every land: praise ye the Lord.

   The seasons of the year.


   With songs and honors sounding loud,

   Address the Lord on high;

   Over the heav'ns he spreads his cloud,

   And waters veil the sky.


   He sends his showers of blessing down

   To cheer the plains below;

   He makes the grass the mountains crown,

   And corn in valleys grow.


   He gives the grazing ox his meat,

   He hears the raven's cry;

   But man, who tastes his finest wheat,

   Should raise his honors high.


   His steady counsels change the face

   Of the declining year;

   He bids the sun cut short his race,

   And wintry days appear.


   His hoary frost, his fleecy snow,

   Descend and clothe the ground;

   The liquid streams forbear to flow,

   In icy fetters bound.


   When from the dreadful stores on high

   He pours the rattling hail,

   The wretch that dares this God defy

   Shall find his courage fail.


   He sends his word, and melts the snow,

   The fields no longer mourn;

   He calls the warmer gales to blow,

   And bids the spring return.


   The changing wind, the flying cloud,

   Obey his mighty word:

   With songs and honors sounding loud,

   Praise ye the sovereign Lord.

   PAUSE.


   Ye tribes of Adam, join

   With heav'n, and earth, and seas,

   And offer notes divine

   To your Creator's praise:

   Ye holy throng

   Of angels bright,

   In worlds of light,

   Begin the song.


   Thou sun with dazzling rays,

   And moon that rules the night,

   Shine to your Maker's praise,

   With stars of twinkling light:

   His power declare,

   Ye floods on high,

   And clouds that fly

   In empty air.


   The shining worlds above

   In glorious order stand,

   Or in swift courses move,

   By his supreme command:

   He spake the word,

   And all their frame

   From nothing came,

   To praise the Lord.


   He moved their mighty wheels

   In unknown ages past,

   And each his word fulfils

   While time and nature last:

   In diff'rent ways

   His works proclaim

   His wondrous name,

   And speak his praise.


   Let all the earth-born race,

   And monsters of the deep

   The fish that cleave the seas,

   Or in their bosom sleep;

   From sea and shore

   Their tribute pay,

   And still display

   Their Maker's power.


   Ye vapors, hail, and snow,

   Praise ye th' almighty Lord,

   And stormy winds that blow,

   To execute his word:

   When lightnings shine,

   Or thunders roar,

   Let earth adore

   His hand divine.


   Ye mountains near the skies,

   With lofty cedars there,

   And trees of humbler size,

   That fruit in plenty bear;

   Beasts wild and tame,

   Birds, flies, and worms,

   In various forms,

   Exalt his name.


   Ye kings and judges, fear

   The Lord, the sovereign King;

   And while you rule us here,

   His heav'nly honors sing;

   Nor let the dream

   Of power and state

   Make you forget

   His power supreme.


   Virgins and youths, engage

   To sound his praise divine,

   While infancy and age

   Their feebler voices join:

   Wide as he reigns

   His name be sung

   By every tongue

   In endless strains.


   Let all the nations fear

   The God that rules above;

   He brings his people near,

   And makes them taste his love:

   While earth and sky

   Attempt his praise,

   His saints shall raise

   His honors high.

   8,8,8,8,8,8

   Universal praise to God.

   [Note-This Psalm may be sung to the tune of the old 112th or 127th
   Psalm, if these two lines be added to every stanza:


   Loud hallelujahs to the Lord,

   From distant worlds where creatures dwell;

   Let heav'n begin the solemn word,

   And sound it dreadful down to hell.


   The Lord, how absolute he reigns!

   Let every angel bend the knee;

   Sing of his love in heav'nly strains,

   And speak how fierce his terrors be.


   High on a throne his glories dwell,

   An awful throne of shining bliss;

   Fly through the world, O sun! and tell

   How dark thy beams compared to his.


   Awake, ye tempests, and his fame

   In sounds of dreadful praise declare;

   And the sweet whisper of his name

   Fill every gentler breeze of air.


   Let clouds, and winds, and waves agree

   To join their praise with blazing fire;

   Let the firm earth and rolling sea

   In this eternal song conspire.


   Ye flowery plains, proclaim his skill;

   Valleys, lie low before his eye;

   And let his praise from every hill

   Rise tuneful to the neighb'ring sky.


   Ye stubborn oaks, and stately pines,

   Bend your high branches and adore:

   Praise him, ye beasts, in diff'rent strains;

   The lamb must bleat, the lion roar.


   Birds, ye must make his praise your theme;

   Nature demands a song from you;

   While the dumb fish that cut the stream

   Leap up, and mean his praises too.


   Mortals, can you refrain your tongue,

   When nature all around you sings?

   O for a shout from old and young,

   From humble swains and lofty kings!


   Wide as his vast dominion lies

   Make the Creator's name be known;

   Loud as his thunder shout his praise,

   And sound it lofty as his throne.


   Jehovah! 'tis a glorious word:

   O may it dwell on every tongue!

   But saints, who best have known the Lord,

   Are bound to raise the noblest song.


   Speak of the wonders of that love

   Which Gabriel plays on every chord:

   From all below, and all above,

   Loud hallelujahs to the Lord!


   Each of his works his name displays

   But they can ne'er fulfil the praise.

   PAUSE I.

   PAUSE II.


   Let every creature join

   To praise th' eternal God;

   Ye heav'nly hosts, the song begin,

   And sound his name abroad.


   Thou sun with golden beams,

   And moon with paler rays;

   Ye starry lights, ye twinkling flames,

   Shine to your Maker's praise.


   He built those worlds above,

   And fixed their wondrous frame;

   By his command they stand or move,

   And ever speak his name.


   Ye vapors, when ye rise,

   Or fall in showers of snow;

   Ye thunders, murmuring round the skies,

   His power and glory show.


   Wind, hail, and flashing fire,

   Agree to praise the Lord,

   When ye in dreadful storms conspire

   To execute his word.


   By all his works above

   His honors be expressed;

   But saints that taste his saving love

   Should sing his praises best.


   Let earth and ocean know

   They owe their Maker praise;

   Praise him, ye wat'ry worlds below,

   And monsters of the seas.


   From mountains near the sky

   Let his high praise resound;

   From humble shrubs and cedars high,

   And vales and fields around.


   Ye lions of the wood,

   And tamer beasts that graze,

   Ye live upon his daily food,

   And he expects your praise.


   Ye birds of lofty wing,

   On high his praises bear;

   Or sit on flowery boughs, and sing

   Your Maker's glory there.


   Ye creeping ants and worms,

   His various wisdom show,

   And flies, in all your shining swarms,

   Praise him that dressed you so.


   By all the earth-born race

   His honors be expressed;

   But saints, that know his heav'nly grace

   Should learn to praise him best.


   Monarchs of wide command,

   Praise ye th' eternal King;

   Judges, adore that sovereign hand

   Whence all your honors spring.


   Let vig'rous youth engage

   To sound his praises high:

   While growing babes, and with'ring age,

   Their feebler voices try.


   United zeal be shown

   His wondrous fame to raise:

   God is the Lord; his name alone

   Deserves our endless praise.


   Let nature join with art,

   And all pronounce him blest;

   But saints, that dwell so near his heart,

   Should sing his praises best.

   His later wonders show.


   The Jews, the people of his grace,

   Shall their Redeemer sing;

   And Gentile nations join the praise,

   While Zion owns her King.


   The Lord takes pleasure in the just,

   Whom sinners treat with scorn;

   The meek that lie despised in dust

   Salvation shall adorn.


   Saints should be joyful in their King,

   E'en on a dying bed;

   And like the souls in glory sing;

   For God shall raise the dead.


   Then his high praise shall fill their tongues

   Their hands shall wield the sword;

   And vengeance shall attend their songs,

   The vengeance of the Lord.


   When Christ the judgment-seat ascends,

   And bids the world appear,

   Thrones are prepared for all his friends

   Who humbly loved him here.


   Then shall they rule with iron rod

   Nations that dared rebel;

   And join the sentence of their God

   On tyrants doomed to hell.


   The royal sinners bound in chains

   New triumphs shall afford:

   Such honor for the saints remains;

   Praise ye, and love the Lord!

  HYMN 1

   C. M.

   A new song to the Lamb that was slain. Rev. 5:6-12


   Behold the glories of the Lamb

   Amidst his Father's throne;

   Prepare new honors for his name,

   And songs before unknown.


   Let elders worship at his feet,

   The church adore around,

   With vials full of odors sweet,

   And harps of sweeter sound.


   Those are the prayers of the saints,

   And these the hymns they raise,

   Jesus is kind to our Complaints,

   He loves to hear our praise.


   [Eternal Father, who shall look

   Into thy secret will?

   Who but the Son shall take that book,

   And open every seal]?


   He shall fulfil thy great decrees,

   The Son deserves it well:

   Lo! in his hand the sovereign keys

   Of heav'n, and death, and hell!]


   Now to the Lamb that once was slain

   Be endless blessings paid;

   Salvation, glory, joy, remain

   For ever on thy head.


   Thou hast redeemed our souls with blood,

   Hast set the pris'ners free;

   Hast made us kings and priests to God,

   And we shall reign with thee.


   The worlds of nature and of grace

   Are put beneath thy power;

   Then shorten these delaying days,

   And bring the promised hour.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 2

   L. M.

   The deity and humanity of Christ.
   John 1:1,3,14;Col. 1:16.


   Ere the blue heav'ns were stretched abroad,

   From everlasting was the Word:

   With God he was; the Word was God,

   And must divinely be adored.


   By his own power were all things made;

   By him supported all things stand;

   He is the whole creation's head,

   And angels fly at his command.


   Ere sin was born, or Satan fell,

   He led the host of morning stars:

   Thy generation who can tell,

   Or count the numbers of thy years?


   But lo! he leaves those heav'nly forms,

   The Word descends and dwells in clay,

   That he may hold converse with worms,

   Dressed in such feeble flesh as they.


   Mortals with joy beheld his face,

   Th' eternal Father's only Son;

   How full of truth! how full of grace!

   When through his eyes the Godhead shone.


   Archangels leave their high abode

   To learn new mysteries here, and tell

   The loves of our descending God,

   The glories of Immanuel.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 3

   S. M.

   The nativity of Christ.
   Luke 1:30ff2:10ff


   Behold, the grace appears!

   The promise is fulfilled;

   Mary, the wondrous virgin, bears,

   And Jesus is the child.


   [The Lord, the highest God,

   Calls him his only Son;

   He bids him rule the lands abroad,

   And gives him David's throne.


   O'er Jacob shall he reign

   With a peculiar sway;

   The nations shall his grace obtain,

   His kingdom ne'er decay.]


   To bring the glorious news

   A heav'nly form appears;

   He tells the shepherds of their joys,

   And banishes their fears.


   "Go, humble swains," said he,

   "To David's city fly;

   The promised infant born to-day

   Doth in a manger lie."


   "With looks and hearts serene,

   Go visit Christ your King;

   And straight a flaming troop was seen:

   The shepherds heard them sing:


   "Glory to God on high!

   And heav'nly peace on earth;

   Goodwill to men, to angels joy,

   At the Redeemer's birth!


   [In worship so divine,

   Let saints employ their tongues;

   With the celestial hosts we join,

   And loud repeat their songs:


   "Glory to God on high!

   And heav'nly peace on earth;

   Goodwill to men, to angels joy,

   At our Redeemer's birth!"]
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 4 PART 1

   C. M.

   The nativity of Christ.
   Luke 2:10ff


   "Shepherds, rejoice! lift up your eyes,

   And send your fears away;

   News from the regions of the skies,

   Salvation's born to-day.


   "Jesus, the God whom angels fear,

   Comes down to dwell with you;

   Today he makes his entrance here,

   But not as monarchs do.


   "No gold nor purple swaddling bands.

   Nor royal shining things;

   A manger for his Cradle stands,

   And holds the King of kings.


   "Go, shepherds, where the infant lies,

   And see his humble throne

   With tears of joy in all your eyes,

   Go, shepherds, kiss the Son."


   Thus Gabriel sang, and straight around

   The heav'nly armies throng;

   They tune their harps to lofty sound,

   And thus conclude the song:


   "Glory to God that reigns above!

   Let peace surround the earth!

   Mortals shall know their Maker's love,

   At their Redeemer's birth."


   Lord, and shall angels have their songs,

   And men no tunes to raise?

   O may we lose our useless tongues

   When they forget to praise.


   Glory to God that reigns above,

   That pitied us forlorn;

   We join to sing our Maker's love,

   For there's a Savior born.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 4 PART 2

   L. M.

   The inward witness to Christianity.
   1 Jn. 5:10.


   Questions and doubts be heard no more,

   Let Christ and joy be all our theme;

   His Spirit seals his gospel sure,

   To every soul that trusts in him.


   Jesus, thy witness speaks within;

   The mercy which thy words reveal

   Refines the heart from sense and sin,

   And stamps its own celestial seal.


   'Tis God's inimitable hand

   That molds and forms the heart anew;

   Blasphemers can no more withstand,

   But bow, and own thy doctrine true.


   The guilty wretch that trusts thy blood

   Finds peace and pardon at the cross;

   The sinful soul, averse to God,

   Believes and loves his Maker's laws.


   Learning and wit may cease their strife,

   When miracles with glory shine;

   The voice that calls the dead to life

   Must be almighty and divine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 5

   C. M.

   Submission to afflictive providences.
   Job 1:21.


   Naked as from the earth we came,

   And crept to life at first,

   We to the earth return again,

   And mingle with our dust.


   The dear delights we here enjoy,

   And fondly call our own,

   Are but short favors borrowed now,

   To be repaid anon.


   'Tis God that lifts our comforts high,

   Or sinks them in the grave;

   He gives, and, blessed be his name!

   He takes but what he gave.


   Peace, all our angry passions, then;

   Let each rebellious sigh

   Be silent at his sovereign will,

   And every murmur die.


   If smiling mercy crown our lives,

   Its praises shall be spread;

   And we'll adore the justice too

   That strikes our comforts dead.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 6

   C. M.

   Triumph over death.
   Job 19:25-27.


   Great God, I own thy sentence just,

   And nature must decay;

   I yield my body to the dust,

   To dwell with fellow clay.


   Yet faith may triumph o'er the grave,

   And trample on the tombs

   My Jesus, my Redeemer, lives;

   My God, my Savior, comes.


   The mighty Conqueror shall appear

   High on a royal seat,

   And death, the last of all his foes,

   Lie vanquished at his feet.


   Though greedy worms devour my skin,

   And gnaw my wasting flesh,

   When God shall build my bones again,

   He clothes them all afresh.


   Then shall I see thy lovely face

   With strong immortal eyes;

   And feast upon thy unknown grace

   With pleasure and suprise.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 7

   C. M.

   The invitation of the gospel.
   Isa. 55:1,2, etc.


   Let every mortal ear attend,

   And every heart rejoice;

   The trumpet of the gospel sounds

   With an inviting voice.


   Lo! all ye hungry, starving souls.

   That feed upon the wind,

   And vainly strive with earthly toys

   To fill an empty mind.


   Eternal Wisdom has prepared

   A soul-reviving feast,

   And bids your longing appetites

   The rich provision taste.


   Ho! ye that pant for living streams,

   And pine away and die,

   here you may quench your raging thirst

   With springs that never dry.


   Rivers of love and mercy here

   In a rich ocean join;

   Salvation in abundance flows,

   Like floods of milk and wine.


   [Ye perishing and naked poor,

   Who work with mighty pain

   To weave a garment of your own

   That will not hide your sin,


   Come naked, and adorn your souls

   In robes prepared by God,

   Wrought by the labors of his Son,

   And dyed in his own blood.]


   Dear God! the treasures of thy love

   Are everlasting mines,

   Deep as our helpless miseries are,

   And boundless as our sins.


   The happy gates of gospel grace

   Stand open night and day;

   Lord, we are come to seek supplies,

   And drive our wants away.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 8

   C. M.

   The safety and protection of the church.
   Isa. 26:1-6.


   How honorable is the place

   Where we adoring stand!

   Zion, the glory of the earth,

   And beauty of the land!


   Bulwarks of mighty grace defend

   The city where we dwell;

   The walls, of strong salvation made,

   Defy the assaults of hell.


   Lift up the everlasting gates,

   The doors wide open fling;

   Enter, ye nations that obey

   The statutes of our King.


   Here shall you taste unmingled joys,

   And live in perfect peace,

   You that have known Jehovah's name.

   And ventured on his grace.


   Trust in the Lord, for ever trust,

   And banish all your fears;

   Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells,

   Eternal as his years.


   [What though the rebels dwell on high,

   His arm shall bring them low;

   Low as the caverns of the grave

   Their lofty heads shall bow.]


   [On Babylon our feet shall tread

   In that rejoicing hour;

   The ruins of her walls shall spread

   A pavement for the poor.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 9

   C. M.

   The promises of the covenant of grace.
   Isa. 55:1,2; Zech. 13:1; Mic. 7:19; Ezek. 36:25


   In vain we lavish out our lives

   To gather empty wind;

   The choicest blessings earth can yield

   Will starve a hungry mind.


   Come, and the Lord shall feed our souls

   With more substantial meat,

   With such as saints in glory love,

   With such as angels eat.


   Our God will every want supply,

   And fill our hearts with peace;

   He gives by cov'nant and by oath

   The riches of his grace.


   Come, and he'll cleanse our spotted souls,

   And wash away our stains

   In the dear fountain that his Son

   Poured from his dying veins.


   [Our guilt shall vanish all away,

   Though black as hell before;

   Our sins shall sink beneath the sea,

   And shall be found no more.


   And, lest pollution should o'erspread

   Our inward powers again,

   His Spirit shall bedew our souls,

   Like purifying rain.]


   Our heart, that flinty, stubborn thing,

   That terrors cannot move,

   That fears no threat'nings of his wrath,

   Shall be dissolved by love.


   Or he can take the flint away

   That would not be refined;

   And from the treasures of his grace

   Bestow a softer mind.


   There shall his sacred Spirit dwell,

   And deep engrave his law,

   And every motion of our souls

   To swift obedience draw.


   Thus will he pour salvation down,

   And we shall render praise;

   We the dear people of his love,

   And he our God of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 10

   S. M.

   The blessedness of gospel times. Isa. 52:2,7-10; Mt. 13:16,17.


   How beauteous are their feet

   Who stand on Zion's hill!

   Who bring salvation on their tongues,

   And words of peace reveal!


   How charming is their voice!

   How sweet the tidings are!

   "Zion, behold thy Savior King;

   He reigns and triumphs here."


   How happy are our ears

   That hear this joyful sound,

   Which kings and prophets waited for,

   And sought, but never found!


   How blessed are our eyes

   That see this heav'nly light

   Prophets and kings desired it long,

   But died without the sight.


   The watchmen join their voice,

   And tuneful notes employ;

   Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,

   And deserts learn the joy.


   The Lord makes bare his arm

   Through all the earth abroad;

   Let every nation now behold

   Their Savior and their God!
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 11

   L. M.

   The humble enlightened, and carnal reason humbled. Luke 10:21,22.


   There was an hour when Christ rejoiced,

   And spoke his joy in words of praise:

   "Father, I thank thee, mighty God,

   Lord of the earth, and heav'ns, and seas.


   "I thank thy sovereign power and love

   That crowns my doctrine with success,

   And makes the babes in knowledge learn

   The heights, and breadths, and lengths of grace.


   "But all this glory lies concealed

   From men of prudence and of wit;

   The prince of darkness blinds their eyes,

   And their own pride resists the light.


   "Father, 'tis thus, because thy will

   Chose and ordained it should be so;

   'Tis thy delight t' abase the proud,

   And lay the haughty scorner low.


   "There's none can know the Father right

   But those who learn it from the Son;

   Nor can the Son be well received

   But where the Father makes him known."


   Then let our souls adore our God,

   Who deals his graces as he please;

   Nor gives to mortals an account

   Or of his actions or decrees.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 12

   C. M.

   Free grace in revealing Christ. Luke 10:21.


   Jesus, the man of constant grief,

   A mourner all his days;

   His spirit once rejoiced aloud,

   And tuned his joy to praise:


   "Father, I thank thy wondrous love,

   That hath revealed thy Son

   To men unlearned, and to babes

   Has made thy gospel known.


   "The mysteries of redeeming grace

   Are hidden from the wise,

   While pride and carnal reasonings join

   To swell and blind their eyes."


   Thus doth the Lord of heav'n and earth

   His great decrees fulfil,

   And orders all his works of grace

   By his own sovereign will.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 13

   L. M.

   The Son of God incarnate. Isa. 9:2,6,7.


   The lands that long in darkness lay

   Now have beheld a heav'nly light;

   Nations that sat in death's cold shade

   Are blessed with beams divinely bright.


   The virgin's promised Son is born,

   Behold th' expected child appear:

   What shall his names or titles be?

   "The Wonderful, the Counsellor."


   [This infant is the mighty God,

   Come to be suckled and adored;

   Th' eternal Father, Prince of Peace,

   The Son of David, and his Lord.]


   The government of earth and seas

   Upon his shoulders shall be laid;

   His wide dominions still increase,

   And honors to his name be paid.


   Jesus, the holy child, shall sit

   High on his father David's throne;

   Shall crush his foes beneath his feet,

   And reign to ages yet unknown.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 14

   L. M.

   The triumph of faith or, Christ's unchangeable love. Rom. 8:33ff.


   Who shall the Lord's elect condemn?

   'Tis God that justifies their souls;

   And mercy, like a mighty stream,

   O'er all their sins divinely rolls.


   Who shall adjudge the saints to hell?

   'Tis Christ that suffered in their stead;

   And, the salvation to fulfil,

   Behold him rising from the dead!


   He lives! he lives and sits above,

   For ever interceding there:

   Who shall divide us from his love?

   Or what should tempt us to despair?


   Shall persecution, or distress,

   Famine, or sword, or nakedness?

   He that hath loved us bears us through,

   And makes us more than conquerors too.


   Faith hath an overcoming power;

   It triumphs in the dying hour:

   Christ is our life, our joy, our hope,

   Nor can we sink with such a prop.


   Not all that men on earth can do,

   Nor powers on high, nor powers below,

   Shall cause his mercy to remove,

   Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 15

   L. M.

   Our own weakness, and Christ our strength. 2 Cor. 12:7,9,10.


   Let me but hear my Savior say,

   "Strength shall be equal to thy day,"

   Then I rejoice in deep distress,

   Leaning on all-sufficient grace.


   I glory in infirmity,

   That Christ's own power may rest on me:

   When I am weak, then am I strong,

   Grace is my shield, and Christ my song.


   I can do all things, or can bear

   All suff'rings, if my Lord be there;

   Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains,

   While his left hand my head sustains.


   But if the Lord be once withdrawn,

   And we attempt the work alone,

   When new temptations spring and rise,

   We find how great our weakness is.


   [So Samson, when his hair was lost,

   Met the Philistines to his cost;

   Shook his vain limbs with sad surprise,

   Made feeble fight, and lost his eyes.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 16

   C. M.

   Hosannah to Christ. Mt. 21:9; Luke 19:38,40.


   Hosannah to the royal Son

   Of David's ancient line!

   His natures two, his person one,

   Mysterious and divine.


   The root of David here, we find,

   And offspring is the same:

   Eternity and time are joined

   In our Immanuel's name.


   Blest he that comes to wretched men

   With peaceful news from heav'n!

   Hosannahs of the highest strain

   To Christ the Lord be giv'n!


   Let mortals ne'er refuse to take

   Th' hosannah on their tongues,

   Lest rocks and stones should rise and break

   Their silence into songs.

  HYMN 17

   C. M.

   Victory over death. 1 Cor. 15:55ff


   O for an overcoming faith

   To cheer my dying hours;

   To triumph o'er the monster Death,

   And all his frightful powers!


   Joyful with all the strength I have

   My quiv'ring lips should sing-

   Where is thy boasted vict'ry, Grave?

   And where the monster's sting?


   If sin be pardoned, I'm secure,

   Death hath no sting beside;

   The law gives sin its damning power;

   But Christ, my ransom, died.


   Now to the God of victory

   Immortal thanks be paid,

   Who makes us conquerors while we die,

   Through Christ our living head.

  HYMN 18

   C. M.

   Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord. Rev. 14:13.


   Hear what the voice from heav'n proclaims,

   For all the pious dead;

   Sweet is the savor of their names,

   And soft their sleeping bed.


   They die in Jesus, and are blest;

   How kind their slumbers are!

   From suff'rings and from sins released,

   And freed from every snare.


   Far from this world of toil and strife,

   They're present with the Lord;

   The labors of their mortal life

   End in a large reward.

   The song of Simeon; or, Death made desirable. Luke 2:27ff


   Lord, at thy temple we appear,

   As happy Simeon came,

   And hope to meet our Savior here;

   O make our joys the same!


   With what divine and vast delight

   The good old man was filled,

   When fondly in his withered arms

   He clasped the holy child!


   "Now I can leave this world," he cried,

   "Behold, thy servant dies;

   I've seen thy great salvation, Lord,

   And close my peaceful eyes.


   "This is the light prepared to shine

   Upon the Gentile lands,

   Thine Isr'el's glory, and their hope

   To break their slavish bands."


   [Jesus! the vision of thy face

   Hath overpowering charms;

   Scarce shall I feel death's cold embrace,

   If Christ be in my arms.


   Then while ye hear my heart-strings breuk,

   How sweet my minutes roll!

   A mortal paleness on my cheek,

   And glory in my soul.]

   Awake, my heart; arise, my tongue,

   Prepare a tuneful voice;

   In God, the life of all my joys,

   Aloud will I rejoice.


   'Tis he adorned my naked soul,

   And made salvation mine;

   Upon a poor polluted worm

   He makes his graces shine.


   And lest the shadow of a spot

   Should on my soul be found,

   He took the robe the Savior wrought,

   And cast it all around.


   How far the heav'nly robe exceeds

   What earthly princes wear

   These ornaments, how bright they shine!

   How white the garments are!


   The Spirit wrought my faith, and love,

   And hope, and every grace;

   But Jesus spent his life to work

   The robe of righteousness.


   Strangely, my soul, art thou arrayed

   By the great Sacred Three!

   In sweetest harmony of praise

   Let all thy powers agree.

   A vision of the kingdom of Christ among men. Rev. 21:1-4.


   Lo! what a glorious sight appears

   To our believing eyes!

   The earth and sea are passed away,

   And the old rolling skies.


   From the third heav'n, where God resides,

   That holy, happy place,

   The new Jerusalem comes down,

   Adorned with shining grace.


   Attending angels shout for joy,

   And the bright armies sing-

   "Mortals, behold the sacred seat

   Of your descending King.


   "The God of glory down to men

   Removes his blest abode;

   Men, the dear objects of his grace,

   And he the loving God.


   "His own soft hand shall wipe the tears

   From every weeping eye,

   And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,

   And death itself, shall die."


   How long, dear Savior! O how long

   Shall this bright hour delay?

   Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time,

   And bring the welcome day.

   Christ the eternal life. Rom. 9:5.


   Jesus, our Savior and our God,

   Arrayed in majesty and blood,

   Thou art our life; our souls in thee

   Possess a full felicity.


   All our immortal hopes are laid

   In thee, our surety and our head;

   Thy cross, thy cradle, and thy throne,

   Are big with glories yet unknown.


   Let atheists scoff, and Jews blaspheme

   Th' eternal life and Jesus' name;

   A word of thy almighty breath

   Dooms the rebellious world to death.


   But let my soul for ever lie

   Beneath the blessings of thine eye;

   'Tis heav'n on earth, 'tis heav'n above,

   To see thy face and taste thy love.

   Flesh and spirit. Rom. 8:1


   What vain desires and passions vain

   Attend this mortal clay!

   Oft have they pierced my soul with pain,

   And drawn my heart astray.


   How have I wandered from my God!

   And, following sin and shame,

   In this vile world of flesh and blood

   Defiled my nobler frame!


   For ever blessed be thy grace

   That formed my soul anew,

   And made it of a heav'n-born race,

   Thy glory to pursue.


   My spirit holds perpetual war,

   And wrestles and complains;

   But views the happy moment near

   That shall dissolve its chains.


   Cheerful in death I close my eyes

   To part with every lust;

   And charge my flesh, whene'er it rise,

   To leave them in the dust.


   My purer spirit shall not fear

   To put this body on;

   Its tempting powers no more are there,

   Its lusts and passions gone!

   Absent from the body, and present with the Lord. 2 Cor. 5:8.


   Absent from flesh! O blissful thought!

   What unknown joys this moment brings!

   Freed from the mischiefs sin has brought,

   From pains, and fears, and all their springs.


   Absent from flesh! illustrious day!

   Surprising scene! triumphant stroke

   That rends the prison of my clay;

   And I can feel my fetters broke.


   Absent from flesh! then rise, my soul,

   Where feet nor wings could never climb,

   Beyond the heav'ns, where planets roll,

   Measuring the cares and joys of time.


   I go where God and glory shine,

   His presence makes eternal day:

   My all that's mortal I resign,

   For angels wait and point my way.

  HYMN 23 PART 2

   L. M.

   A hopeful youth falling short of heaven. Mark 10:21.


   Must all the charms of nature, then,

   So hopeless to salvation prove?

   Can hell demand, can heav'n condemn,

   The man whom Jesus deigns to love?


   The man who sought the ways of truth,

   Paid friends and neighbors all their due;

   A modest, sober, lovely youth,

   And thought he wanted nothing new.


   But mark the change; thus spake the Lord-

   "Come, part with earth for heav'n today:"

   The youth, astonished at the word,

   In silent sadness went his way.


   Poor virtues that he boasted so,

   This test unable to endure;

   Let Christ, and grace, and glory go,

   To make his land and money sure!


   Ah, foolish choice of treasures here!

   Ah, fatal love of tempting gold!

   Must this base world be bought so dear?

   Are life and heav'n so cheaply sold?


   In vain the charms of nature shine,

   If this vile passion govern me:

   Transform my soul, O love divine!

   And make me part with all for thee.

   L. M.

   The rich sinner dying. Psa. 49:6,9; Eccl. 8:8; Job 3:14,15.


   In vain the wealthy mortals toil,

   And heap their shining dust in vain,

   Look down and scorn the humble poor,

   And boast their lofty hills of gain.


   Their golden cordials cannot ease

   Their pained hearts or aching heads,

   Nor fright nor bribe approaching death

   From glitt'ring roofs and downy beds.


   The ling'ring, the unwilling soul

   The dismal summons must obey,

   And bid a long, a sad farewell

   To the pale lump of lifeless clay.


   Thence they are huddled to the grave,

   Where kings and slaves have equal thrones;

   Their bones without distinction lie

   Amongst the heap of meaner bones.

   L. M.

   A vision of the Lamb. Rev. 5:6-9.


   All mortal vanities, begone,

   Nor tempt my eyes, nor tire my ears;

   Behold, amidst th' eternal throne,

   A vision of the Lamb appears.


   [Glory his fleecy robe adorns,

   Marked with the bloody death he bore;

   Seven are his eyes, and seven his horns,

   To speak his wisdom and his power.


   Lo! he receives a sealed book

   From him that sits upon the throne;

   Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look

   On dark decrees and things unknown.]


   All the assembling saints around

   Fall worshipping before the Lamb,

   And in new songs of gospel sound

   Address their honors to his name.


   [The Joy, the shout, the harmony,

   Flies o'er the everlasting hills

   "Worthy art thou alone," they cry,

   To read the book, to loose the seals."]


   Our voices join the heav'nly strain,

   And with transporting pleasure sing,

   "Worthy the Lamb that once was slain,

   To be our Teacher and our King!"


   His words of prophecy reveal

   Eternal counsels, deep designs;

   His grace and vengeance shall fulfil

   The peaceful and the dreadful lines.


   Thou hast redeemed our souls from hell

   With thine invaluable blood;

   And wretches that did once rebel

   Are now made fav'rites of their God.


   Worthy for ever is the Lord,

   That died for treasons not his own,

   By every tongue to be adored,

   And dwell upon his Father's throne!

   Hope of heaven by the resurrection of Christ. 1 Pet. 1:3-5.


   Blest be the everlasting God,

   The Father of our Lord;

   Be his abounding mercy praised,

   His majesty adored.


   When from the dead he raised his Son,

   And called him to the sky,

   He gave our souls a lively hope

   That they should never die.


   What though our inbred sins require

   Our flesh to see the dust,

   Yet as the Lord our Savior rose,

   So all his followers must.


   There's an inheritance divine

   Reserved against that day;

   'Tis uncorrupted, undefiled,

   And cannot waste away.


   Saints by the power of God are kept

   Till the salvation come;

   We walk by faith as strangers here,

   Till Christ shall call us home.

   Assurance of heaven. 2 Tim. 4:68,18.


   [Death may dissolve my body now,

   And bear my spirit home;

   Why do my minutes move so slow,

   Nor my salvation come?


   With heav'nly weapons I have fought

   The battles of the Lord;

   Finished my course, and kept the faith,

   And wait the sure reward.]


   God has laid up in heav'n for me

   A crown which cannot fade;

   The righteous Judge at that great day

   Shall place it on my head.


   Nor hath the King of grace decreed

   This prize for me alone;

   But all that love and long to see

   Th' appearance of his Son.


   Jesus the Lord shall guard me safe

   From every ill design;

   And to his heav'nly kingdom keep

   This feeble soul of mine.


   God is my everlasting aid,

   And hell shall rage in vain;

   To him be highest glory paid

   And endless praise--Amen.

   The triumph of Christ over the enemies of his church. Isa. 63:1-3, etc.


   What mighty man, or mighty God,

   Comes travelling in state,

   Along the Idumean road,

   Away from Bozrah's gate?


   The glory of his robes proclaim

   'Tis some victorious king:

   "'Tis I, the Just, th' Almighty One,

   That your salvation bring."


   "Why, mighty Lord," thy saints inquire,

   "Why thine apparel's red?

   And all thy vesture stained like those

   Who in the wine-press tread?"


   "I by myself have trod the press,

   And crushed my foes alone;

   My wrath has struck the rebels dead,

   My fury stamped them down.


   "'Tis Edom's blood that dyes my robes

   With joyful scarlet stains;

   The triumph that my raiment wears

   Sprung from their bleeding veins.


   "Thus shall the nations be destroyed

   That dare insult my saints;

   I have an arm t' avenge their wrongs,

   An ear for their complaints."

   The ruin of Antichrist. Isa. 63:4-7.


   "I lift my banner," saith the Lord,

   "Where Antichrist has stood;

   The city of my gospel foes

   Shall be a field of blood.


   "My heart has studied just revenge,

   And now the day appears;

   The day of my redeemed is come

   To wipe away their tears.


   "Quite weary is my patience grown,

   And bids my fury go;

   Swift as the lightning it shall move,

   And be as fatal too.


   "I call for helpers, but in vain;

   Then has my gospel none?

   Well, mine own arm has might enough

   To crush my foes alone.


   "Slaughter and my devouring sword

   Shall walk the streets around,

   Babel shall reel beneath my stroke,

   And stagger to the ground."


   Thy honors, O victorious King!

   Thine own right hand shall raise,

   While we thy awful vengeance sing,

   And our deliv'rer praise.

   Prayer for deliverance answered. Isa. 26:12,20,21.


   In thine own ways, O God of love,

   We wait the visits of thy grace,

   Our soul's desire is to thy name,

   And the remembrance of thy face.


   My thoughts are searching, Lord, for thee

   'Mongst the black shades of lonesome night;

   My earnest cries salute the skies

   Before the dawn restore the light.


   Look, how rebellious men deride

   The tender patience of my God!

   But they shall see thy lifted hand,

   And feel the scourges of thy rod.


   Hark! the Eternal rends the sky,

   A mighty voice before him goes;

   A voice of music to his friends,

   But threat'ning thunder to his foes.


   Come, children, to your Father's arms,

   Hide in the chambers of my grace,

   Till the fierce storms be overblown,

   And my revenging fury cease.


   My sword shall boast its thousands slain,

   And drink the blood of haughty kings,

   While heav'nly peace around my flock

   Stretches its soft and shady wings.

   Condescending grace. Psa. 138:6.


   When the Eternal bows the skies

   To visit earthly things,

   With scorn divine he turns his eyes

   From towers of haughty kings.


   He bids his aweful chariot roll

   Far downward from the skies,

   To visit every humble soul

   With pleasure in his eyes.


   Why should the Lord that reigns above

   Disdain so lofty kings?

   Say, Lord, and why such looks of love

   Upon such worthless things?


   Mortals, be dumb; what creature dares

   Dispute his aweful will?

   Ask no account of his affairs,

   But tremble and be still.


   Just like his nature is his grace,

   All sovereign and all free;

   Great God, how searchless are thy ways,

   How deep thy judgments be!

   The Christian's hidden life. Col. 3:3.


   O happy soul that lives on high

   While men lie grov'lling here

   His hopes are fixed above the sky,

   And faith forbids his fear.


   His conscience knows no secret stings,

   While peace and joy combine

   To form a life whose holy springs

   Are hidden and divine.


   He waits in secret on his God,

   His God in secret sees;

   Let earth be all in arms abroad,

   He dwells in heav'nly peace.


   His pleasures rise from things unseen,

   Beyond this world and time;

   Where neither eyes nor ears have been,

   Nor thoughts of sinners climb.


   He wants no pomp nor royal throne

   To raise his figure here;

   Content and pleased to live unknown,

   Till Christ, his life, appear.


   He looks to heav'n's eternal hill

   To meet that glorious day;

   But patient waits his Savior's will

   To fetch his soul away.

  HYMN 32

   C. M.

   Strength from heaven. Isa. 40:27-30.


   Whence do our mournful thoughts arise?

   And where's our courage fled?

   Have restless sin and raging hell

   Struck all our comforts dead?


   Have we forgot th' almighty name

   That formed the earth and sea?

   And can an all-creating arm

   Grow weary or decay?


   Treasures of everlasting might

   In our Jehovah dwell;

   He gives the conquest to the weak

   And treads their foes to hell.


   Mere mortal power shall fade and die,

   And youthful vigor cease:

   But we that wait upon the Lord

   Shall feel our strength increase.


   The saints shall mount on eagles' wings,

   And taste the promised bliss,

   Till their unwearied feet arrive

   Where perfect pleasure is.

  HYMN 33

   C. M.

   Absurdity of infidelity. 1 Cor. 1:26-31.


   Shall atheists dare insult the cross

   Of our Redeemer, God?

   Shall infidels reproach his laws,

   Or trample on his blood?


   What if he choose mysterious ways

   To cleanse us from our faults?

   May not the works of sovereign grace

   Transcend our feeble thoughts?


   What if his gospel bids us fight

   With flesh, and self, and sin,

   The prize is most divinely bright

   That we are called to win.


   What if the foolish and the poor

   His glorious grace partake,

   This but confirms his truth the more,

   For so the prophets spake.


   Do some that own his sacred name

   Indulge their souls in sin?

   Jesus should never bear the blame,

   His laws are pure and clean.


   Then let our faith grow firm and strong,

   Our lips profess his word;

   Nor blush nor fear to walk among

   The men that love the Lord.

  HYMN 34 PART 1

   L. M.

   The gospel the power of God to salvation. Rom. 1:16.


   What shall the dying sinner do

   That seeks relief for all his woe?

   Where shall the guilty conscience find

   Ease for the torment of the mind?


   How shall we get our crimes forgiv'n?

   Or form our natures fit for heav'n?

   Can souls all o'er defiled with sin

   Make their own powers and passions clean?


   In vain we search, in vain we try,

   Till Jesus brings his gospel nigh;

   'Tis there such power and glory dwell

   As save rebellious souls from hell.


   This is the pillar of our hope

   That bears our fainting spirits up:

   We read the grace, we trust the word,

   And find salvation in the Lord.


   Let men or angels dig the mines,

   Where nature's golden treasure shines;

   Brought near the doctrine of the cross,

   All nature's gold appears but dross.


   Should vile blasphemers with disdain

   Pronounce the truths of Jesus vain,

   I'll meet the scandal and the shame,

   And sing and triumph in his name.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 34 PART 2

   C. M.

   None excluded from hope. Rom. 1:16; 1 Cor. 1:24.


   Jesus, thy blessings are not few,

   Nor is thy gospel weak;

   Thy grace can melt the stubborn Jew,

   And bow th' aspiring Greek.


   Wide as the reach of Satan's rage

   Doth thy salvation flow;

   'Tis not confined to sex or age,

   The lofty or the low.


   While grace is offered to the prince,

   The poor may take their share;

   No mortal has a just pretence

   To perish in despair


   Be wise, ye men of strength and wit,

   Nor boast your native powers;

   But to his sovereign grace submit,

   And glory shall be yours.


   Come, all ye vilest sinners, come,

   He'll form your souls anew;

   His gospel and his heart have room

   For rebels such as you.


   His doctrine is almighty love;

   There's virtue in his name

   To turn the raven to a dove,

   The lion to a lamb.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 35 PART 1

   L. M.

   Faith the way to salvation. Rom. 1:16; Eph. 2:8,9.


   Not by the laws of innocence

   Can Adam's sons arrive at heav'n;

   New works can give us no pretence

   To have our ancient sins forgiv'n.


   Not the best deeds that we have done

   Can make a wounded conscience whole;

   Faith is the grace, and faith alone,

   That flies to Christ, and saves the soul.


   Lord, I believe thy heav'nly word,

   Fain would I have my soul renewed;

   I mourn for sin, and trust the Lord

   To have it pardoned and subdued.


   O may thy grace its power display,

   Let guilt and death no longer reign;

   Save me in thine appointed way,

   Nor let my humble faith be vain.

   Truth, sincerity, etc. Phil. 4:8.


   Let those who bear the Christian name

   Their holy vows fulfil;

   The saints, the followers of the Lamb,

   Are men of honor still.


   True to the solemn oaths they take,

   Though to their hurt they swear;

   Constant and just to all they speak,

   For God and angels hear.


   Still with their lips their hearts agree,

   Nor flatt'ring words devise;

   They know the God of truth can see

   Through every false disguise.


   They hate th' appearance of a lie

   In all the shapes it wears;

   They live in truth, and when they die,

   Eternal life is theirs.


   While hypocrites and liars fly

   Before the Judge's frown,

   His faithful friends, who fear a lie,

   Receive th' immortal crown.

   C. M.

   A lovely carriage. Matt. 10:16.


   O 'tis a lovely thing to see

   A man of prudent heart,

   Whose thoughts, and lips, and life agree

   To act a useful part.


   When envy, strife, and wars begin

   In little angry souls,

   Mark how the sons of peace come in,

   And quench the kindling coals.


   Their minds are humble, mild, and meek,

   Nor let their fury rise;

   Nor passion moves their lips to speak,

   Nor pride exalts their eyes.


   Their frame is prudence mixed with love,

   Good works fulfil their day;

   They join the serpent with the dove,

   But cast the sting away.


   Such was the Savior of mankind,

   Such pleasures he pursued;

   His flesh and blood were all refined,

   His soul divinely good.


   Lord, can these plants of virtue grow

   In such a heart as mine?

   Thy grace my nature can renew,

   And make my soul like thine.

   L. M.

   Christ's humiliation, exaltation, and triumph. Phil. 2:8,9; Mark
   15:20,24,29; Col. 2:15.


   The mighty frame of glorious grace,

   That brightest monument of praise

   That e'er the God of love designed,

   Employs and fills my lab'ring mind.


   Begin, my soul, the heav'nly song,

   A burden for an angel's tongue:

   When Gabriel sounds these awful things,

   He tunes and summons all his stungs.


   Proclaim inimitable love:

   Jesus, the Lord of worlds above,

   Puts off the beams of bright array,

   And veils the God in mortal clay!


   What black reproach defiled his name,

   When with our sins he took our shame!

   He whom adoring angels blessed

   Is made the impious rebel's jest.


   He that distributes crowns and thrones

   Hangs on a tree, and bleeds, and groans!

   The Prince of Life resigns his breath,

   The King of Glory bows to death!


   But see the wonders of his power,

   He triumphs in his dying hour;

   And while by Satan's rage he fell,

   He dashed the rising hopes of hell.


   Thus were the hosts of death subdued,

   And sin was drowned in Jesus' blood;

   Thus he arose, and reigns above,

   And conquers sinners by his love.


   Who shall fulfil this boundless song?

   The theme surmounts an angel's tongue:

   How low, how vain are mortal airs,

   When Gabriel's nobler harp despairs!

   Zeal and fortitude. Matt. 5:16.

   PAUSE.


   Do I believe what Jesus saith,

   And think his gospel true?

   Lord, make me bold to own my faith,

   And practise virtue too.


   Suppress my shame, subdue my fear,

   Arm me with heav'nly zeal,

   That I may make thy power appear,

   And works of praise fulfil.


   If men shall see my virtue shine,

   And spread my name abroad,

   Thine is the power, the praise is thine,

   My Savior and my God!


   Thus when the saints in glory meet,

   Their lips proclaim thy grace;

   They cast their honors at thy feet,

   And own their borrowed rays.


   Are we the soldiers of the cross?

   The followers of the Lamb?

   And shall we fear to own his cause,

   Or blush to speak his name?


   Now must we fight if we would reign

   Increase our courage, Lord

   We'll bear the toil, endure the pain,

   Supported by thy word.


   Thy saints in all this glorions war

   Shall conquer, though they're slain;

   They see the triumph from afar,

   And shall with Jesus reign.


   When that illustrious day shall rise,

   And all thy armies shine

   In robes of vict'ry through the skies,

   The glory shall be thine.

   The atonement of Christ. Rom. 3:25.


   How is our nature spoiled by sin!

   Yet nature ne'er hath found

   The way to make the conscience clean,

   Or heal the painful wound.


   In vain we seek for peace with God

   By methods of our own:

   Jesus, there's nothing but thy blood

   Can bring us near the throne.


   The threat'nings of thy broken law

   Impress our souls with dread;

   If God his sword of vengeance draw,

   It strikes our spirits dead.


   But thine illustrious sacrifice

   Hath answered these demands:

   And peace and pardon from the skies

   Came down by Jesus' hands.


   Here all the ancient types agree,

   The altar and the lamb;

   And prophets in their visions see

   Salvation through his name.


   'Tis by thy death we live, O Lord,

   'Tis on thy cross we rest;

   For ever be thy love adored,

   Thy name for ever blessed.

   The universal law of equity. Matt. 8:12.


   Blessed Redeemer, how divine,

   How righteous is this rule of thine!

   "To do to all men just the same

   As we expect or wish from them."


   This golden lesson, short and plain,

   Gives not the mind nor mem'ry pain;

   And every conscience must approve

   This universal law of love.


   How blest would every nation be,

   Thus ruled by love and equity!

   All would be friends without a foe,

   And form a paradise below.


   Jesus, forgive us, that we keep

   Thy sacred law of love asleep;

   No more let envy, wrath, and pride,

   But thy blest maxims be our guide.

   Now shall my inward joys arise,

   And burst into a song;

   Almighty love inspires my heart,

   And pleasure tunes my tongue.


   God on his thirsty Zion hill

   Some mercy drops has thrown,

   And solemn oaths have bound his love

   To shower salvation down.


   Why do we then indulge our fears,

   Suspicions, and complaints?

   Is he a God, and shall his grace

   Grow weary of his saints?


   Can a kind woman e'er forget

   The infant of her womb?

   And 'mongst a thousand tender thoughts

   Her suckling have no room?


   "Yet," saith the Lord, "should nature change,

   And mothers monsters prove,

   Zion still dwells upon the heart

   Of everlasting love.


   "Deep on the palms of both my hands

   I have engraved her name;

   My hands shall raise her ruined walls,

   And build her broken frame?"

   The business and blessedness of glorified saints. Rev. 7:13ff.


   "What happy men, or angels, these,

   That all their robes are spotless white?

   Whence did this glorious troop arrive

   At the pure realms of heav'nly light?"


   From torturing racks, and burning fires,

   And seas of their own blood, they came;

   But nobler blood has washed their robes,

   Flowing from Christ the dying Lamb.


   Now they approach th' Almighty throne

   With loud hosannahs night and day;

   Sweet anthems to the great Three One

   Measure their blest eternity.


   No more shall hunger pain their souls;

   He bids their parching thirst begone,

   And spreads the shadow of his wings

   To screen them from the scorching sun.


   The Lamb that fills the middle throne

   Shall shed around his milder beams;

   There shall they feast on his rich love,

   And drink full joys from living streams.


   Thus shall their mighty bliss renew

   Through the vast round of endless years;

   And the soft hand of sovereign grace

   Heals all their wounds and wipes their tears.

   The same; or, The martyrs glorified. Rev. 7:13ff.


   "These glorious minds, how brigh they shine!

   Whence all their white array?

   How came they to the happy seats

   Of everlasting day?"


   From torturing pains to endless joys

   On fiery wheels they rode,

   And strangely washed their raiment white

   In Jesus' dying blood.


   Now they approach a spotless God,

   And bow before his throne

   Their warbling harps and sacred songs

   Adore the Holy One.


   The unveiled glories of his face

   Amongst his saints reside,

   While the rich treasure of his grace

   Sees all their wants supplied.


   Tormenting thirst shall leave their souls,

   And hunger flee as fast;

   The fruit of life's immortal tree

   Shall be their sweet repast.


   The Lamb shall lead his heav'nly flock

   Where living fountains rise;

   And love divine shall wipe away

   The sorrows of their eyes.

   Divine wrath and mercy. Nah. 1:1-3; Heb. 12:29.


   Adore and tremble, for our God

   Is a consuming fire!

   His jealous eyes his wrath inflame,

   And raise his vengeance higher.


   Almighty vengeance, how it burns!

   How bright his fury glows!

   Vast magazines of plagues and storms

   Lie treasured for his foes.


   Those heaps of wrath, by slow degrees,

   Are forced into a flame;

   But kindled, oh! how fierce they blaze!

   And rend all nature's frame.


   At his approach the mountains flee,

   And seek a wat'ry grave;

   The frighted sea makes haste away,

   And shrinks up every wave.


   Through the wide air the weighty rocks

   Are swift as hailstones hurled;

   Who dares engage his fiery rage

   That shakes the solid world?


   Yet, mighty God, thy sovereign grace

   Sits regent on the throne;

   The refuge of thy chosen race

   When wrath comes rushing down.


   Thy hand shall on rebellious kings

   A fiery tempest pour,

   While we beneath thy shelt'ring wings

   Thy just revenge adore.

   Jesus our surety and Savior. 1 Pet. 1:18; Gal. 3:13; Rom. 4:25.


   Adam, our father and our head,

   Transgressed, and justice doomed us dead;

   The fiery law speaks all despair:

   There's no reprieve nor pardon there.


   But, O unutterable grace

   The Son of God takes Adam's place;

   Down to our world the Savior flies,

   Stretches his arms, and bleeds, and dies.


   Justice was pleased to bruise the God,

   And pay its wrongs with heav'nly blood:

   What unknown racks and pangs he bore!

   Then rose; the law could ask no more.


   Amazing work! look down, ye skies,

   Wonder and gaze with all your eyes;

   Ye heav'nly thrones, stoop from above,

   And bow to this mysterious love.


   Lo! they adore th' incarnate Son,

   And sing the glories he hath won;

   Sing how he broke our iron chains,

   How deep he suiik, how high he reigns!


   Triumph and reign, victorious Lord,

   By all the flaming hosts adored;

   And say, dear Couqueror, say how long

   Ere we shall rise to join their song.


   Send down a chariot from above,

   With fiery wheels, and paved with love

   Raise us beyond th' ethereal blue,

   To sing and love as angels do.

   The Christian's treasure. 1 Cor. 3:21.


   How vast the treasure we possess!

   How rich thy bounty, King of grace!

   This world is ours, and worlds to come;

   Earth is our lodge, and heav'n our home.


   All things are ours: the gifts of God;

   The purchase of a Savior's blood;

   While the good Spirit shows us how

   To use, and to improve them too.


   If peace and plenty crown my days,

   They help me, Lord, to speak thy praise;

   If bread of sorrows be my food,

   Those sorrows work my lasting good.


   I would not change my blest estate

   For all the world calls good or great;

   And while my faith can keep her hold,

   I envy not the sinner's gold.


   Father, I wait thy daily will;

   Thou shalt divide my portion still;

   Grant me on earth what seems thee best,

   Till death and heav'n reveal the rest.

   Christ's dying, rising, and reigning. Luke 23:27,29,44-46; Mt.
   27:50,57; 28:6ff.


   He dies! the friend of sinners dies!

   Lo! Salem's daughters weep around;

   A solemn darkness veils the skies;

   A sudden trembling shakes the ground.


   Come, saints, and drop a tear or two

   For him who groaned beneath your load:

   He shed a thousand drops for you,

   A thousand drops of richer blood.


   Here's love and grief beyond degree,

   The Lord of glory dies for men!

   But lo! what sudden joys we see;

   Jesus the dead revives again!


   The rising God forsakes the tomb!

   The tomb in vain forbids his rise;

   Cherubic legions guard him home,

   And shout him welcome to the skies


   Break off your fears, ye saints, and tell

   How high our great Deliv'rer reigns;

   Sing how he spoiled the hosts of hell,

   And led the monster Death in chains.


   Say, "Live for ever, wondrous King!

   Born to redeem, and strong to save;

   Then ask the monster, "Where's thy sting?"

   And, "Where's thy vict'ry, boasting Grave?"

   A fitter heir of heav'n.


   In vain these moments shall not pass,

   These golden hours be gone:

   Lord, I accept thine offered grace,

   I bow before thy throne.


   Now cleanse my soul from every sin

   By my Redeemer's blood;

   Now let my flesh and soul begin

   The honors of my God.


   Let me no more my soul beguile

   With sin's deceitful toys;

   Let cheerful hope, increasing still,

   Approach to heav'nly joys.


   My thankful lips shall loud proclaim

   The wonders of thy praise,

   And spread the savor of thy name

   Where'er I spend my days.

   The last judgment. Rev. 21:5-8.


   See where the great incarnate God

   Fills a majestic throne;

   While from the skies his awful voice

   Bears the last judgment down.


   ["I am the first, and I the last,

   Through endless years the same;

   I AM is my memorial still,

   And my eternal name.


   "Such favors as a God can give

   My royal grace bestows:

   Ye thirsty souls, come taste the streams,

   Where life and pleasure flows.]


   ["The saint that triumphs o'er his sins,

   I'll own him for a son;

   The whole creation shall reward

   The conquests he has won.


   "But bloody hands, and hearts unclean,

   And all the lying race,

   The faithless and the scoffing crew,

   That spurn at offered grace;


   "They shall be taken from my sight,

   Bound fast in iron chains,

   And headlong plunged into the lake

   Where fire and darkness reigns."]


   O may I stand before the Lamb,

   When earth and seas are fled!

   And hear the Judge pronounce my name,

   With blessings on my head!


   May I with those for ever dwell

   Who here were my delight!

   While sinners, banished down to hell,

   No more offend my sight.

   God glorious, and sinners saved. Rom. 1:30; 5:8,9; 1 Pet. 3:22.


   Father, how wide thy glories shine!

   How high thy wonders rise!

   Known through the earth by thousand signs,

   By thousand through the skies.


   Those mighty orbs proclaim thy power,

   Their motions speak thy skill,

   And on the wings of every hour

   We read thy patience still.


   But when we view thy strange design

   To save rebellious worms,

   Our souls are filled with awe divine

   To see what God performs.


   When sinners break the Father's laws,

   The dying Son atones;

   O the dear myst'ries of his cross,

   The triumph of his groans


   Now the full glories of the Lamb

   Adorn the heav'nly plains;

   Sweet cherubs learn Immanuel's name,

   And try their choicest strains.

   In that immortal song!

   Wonder and joy shall tune my heart,

   And love command my tongue.

   Awake, my zeal; awake, my love,

   To serve my Savior here below,

   In works which perfect saints above

   And holy angels cannot do.


   Awake, my charity, to feed

   The hungry soul, and clothe the poor;

   In heav'n are found no sons of need,

   There all these duties are no more.


   Subdue thy passions, O my soul!

   Maintain the fight, thy work pursue,

   Daily thy rising sins control,

   And be thy vict'ries ever new.


   The land of triumph lies on high,

   There are no foes t' encounter there;

   Lord, I would conquer till I die,

   And finish all the glorious war.

   Death of kindred improved. Zech. 1:5.


   Must friends and kindred droop and die,

   And helpers be withdrawn?

   While sorrow with a weeping eye

   Counts up our comforts gone?


   Be thou our comfort, mighty God!

   Our helper and our friend;

   Nor leave us in this dangerous road,

   Till all our trials end.


   O may our feet pursue the way

   Our pious fathers led!

   With love and holy zeal obey

   The counsels of the dead.


   Let us be weaned from all below,

   Let hope our grief expel,

   While death invites our souls to go

   Where our best kindred dwell.

   Awake, our souls; away, our fears,

   Let every trembling thought begone;

   Awake, and run the heav'nly race,

   And put a cheerful courage on.


   True, 'tis a strait and thorny road,

   And mortal spirits tire and faint;

   But they forget the mighty God,

   That feeds the strength of every saint.


   Thee, mighty God! whose matchless power

   Is ever new and ever young,

   And firm endures, while endless years

   Their everlasting circles run.


   From thee, the overflowing spring,

   Our souls shall drink a fresh supply,

   While such as trust their native strength

   Shall melt away, and droop, and die.


   Swift as an eagle cuts the air,

   We'll mount aloft to thine abode

   On wings of love our souls shall fly,

   Nor tire amidst the heav'nly road.

   The works of Moses and the Lamb. Rev. 15:3.


   How strong thine arm is, mighty God!

   Who would not fear thy name?

   Jesus, how sweet thy graces are!

   Who would not love the Lamb?


   He has done more than Moses did,

   Our Prophet and our King;

   From bonds of hell he freed our souls,

   And taught our lips to sing.


   In the Red Sea, by Moses' hand,

   Th' Egyptian host was drowned;

   But his own blood hides all our sins,

   And guilt no more is found.


   When through the desert Isr'el went,

   With manna they were fed:

   Our Lord invites us to his flesh,

   And calls it living bread.


   Moses beheld the promised land,

   Yet never reached the place;

   But Christ shall bring his followers home,

   To see his Father's face.


   Then shall our love and joy be full,

   And feel a warmer flame;

   And sweeter voices tune the song

   Of Moses and the Lamb.

   Who makes his truth appear;

   His mighty hand fulfils his word,

   And all the oaths he sware.


   Now he bedews old David's root

   With blessings from the skies;

   He makes the Branch of Promise grow,

   The promised Horn arise.


   [John wns the prophet of the Lord,

   To go before his face;

   The herald which our Savior God

   Sent to prepare his ways.


   He makes the great salvation known,

   He speaks of pardoned sins;

   While grace divine, and heav'nly love,

   In its own glory shines.


   "Behold the Lamb of God," he cnes.

   "That takes our guilt away;

   I saw the Spirit o'er his head,

   On his baptizing day.]


   "Be every vale exalted high,

   Sink every mountain low;

   The proud must stoop, and humble souls

   Shall his salvation know.


   "The heathen realms with Isr'el's land

   Shall join in sweet accord

   And all that's born of man shall see

   'Tis his almighty love,

   His counsel, and' his care,

   Preserves us safe from sin and death,

   And every hurtful snare.


   He will present our souls,

   Unblemished and complete,

   Before the glory of his face,

   With joys divinely great.


   Then all the chosen seed

   Shall meet around the throne,

   Shall bless the conduct of his grace,

   Immortal crowns of majesty,

   And everlasting songs.

   Baptism. Matt. 28:19; Acts 2:38.


   'Twas the commission of our Lord,

   "Go teach the nations, and baptize:"

   The nations have received the word

   Since he ascended to the skies.


   He sits upon th' eternal hills,

   With grace and pardon in his hands;

   And sends his cov'nant with the seals,

   To bless the distant British lands.


   "Repent, and be baptized," he saith,

   For the remission of your sins:"

   And thus our sense assists our faith,

   And shows us what his gospel means.


   Our souls he washes in his blood,

   As water makes the body clean;

   And the good Spirit from our God

   Descends like purifying rain.


   Thus we engage ourselves to thee,

   And seal our cov'nant with the Lord;

   O may the great eternal Three

   In heav'n our solemn vows record!

   His mind and will to saints of old,

   Sent down his Son, with truth and grace,

   To teach us in these latter days.


   Our nation reads the written word,

   That book of life, that sure record:

   The bright inheritance of heav'n

   Is by the sweet conveyance giv'n.


   God's kindest thoughts are here expressed,

   Able to make us wise and bless'd;

   The doctrines are divinely true,

   Fit for reproof and comfort too.

   Jesus, we bless thy Father's name;

   Thy God and ours are both the same;

   What heav'nly blessings from his throne

   Flow down to sinners through his Son!


   "Christ be my first elect," he said,

   Then chose our souls in Christ our head,

   Before he gave the mountains birth,

   Or laid foundations for the earth.


   Thus did eternal love begin

   To raise us up from death and sin;

   Our characters were then decreed,

   "Blameless in love, a holy seed."


   Predestinated to be sons,

   Born by degrees, but chose at once,

   A new regenerated race,

   To praise the glory of his grace.


   With Christ our Lord we share our part

   In the affections of his heart;

   Nor shall our souls be thence removed,

   Till he forgets his first-beloved.

   When we are raised from deep distress,

   Our God deserves a song;

   We take the pattern of our praise

   From Hezekiah's tongue.


   The gates of the devouring grave

   Are opened wide in vain,

   If he that holds the keys of death

   Commands them fast again.


   Pains of the flesh are wont t' abuse

   Our minds with slavish fears:

   "Our days are past, and we shall lose

   The remnant of our years."


   We chatter with a swallow's voice,

   Or like a dove we mourn,

   With bitterness instead of joys,

   Afflicted and forlorn.


   Jehovah speaks the healing word,

   And no disease withstands;

   Fevers and plagues obey the Lord,

   And fly at his commands.


   If half the strings of life should break,

   He can our frame restore;

   He casts our sins behind his back,

   And they are found no more.

   Thou King of saints, Almighty Lord,

   How just and true thy ways!


   Who dares refuse to fear thy name,

   Or worship at thy throne?

   Thy judgments speak thine holiness

   Through all the nations known.


   Great Babylon that rules the earth,

   Drunk with the martyrs' blood,

   Her crimes shall speedily awake

   The fury of our God.

   In our first father's fall!


   To all that's good averse and blind,

   But prone to all that's ill

   What dreadful darkness veils our mind!

   How obstinate our will!


   [Conceived in sin, O wretched state!

   Before we draw our breath

   The first young pulse begins to beat

   Iniquity and death.


   How strong in our degen'rate blood

   The old corruption reigns,

   And, mingling with the crooked flood,

   Wanders through all our veins.]


   [Wild and unwholesome as the root

   Will all the branches be;

   How can we hope for living fruit

   What mortal power from things unclean

   Let mortal tongues attempt to sing

   The wars of heav'n, when Michael stood

   Chief general of th' Eternal King,

   And fought the battles of our God.


   Against the dragon and his host

   The armies of the Lord prevail:

   In vain they rage, in vain they boast,

   Their courage sinks, their weapons fail.


   Down to the earth was Satan thrown,

   Down to the earth his legions fell;

   Then was the trump of triumph blown,

   And shook the dreadful deeps of hell.


   Now is the hour of darkness past,

   Christ has assum'd his reigning power;

   Behold the great accuser cast

   Down from the skies to rise no more.


   'Twas by thy blood, immortal Lamb,

   Thine armies trod the tempter down;

   'Twas by thy word and powerful name

   They gain'd the battle and renown.


   Rejoice, ye heav'ns; let every star

   Nor let thy chariots long delay.

   Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, worshipped by all the creation. Rev.
   5:11-13.


   Come, let us join our cheerful songs

   With angels round the throne;

   Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,

   But all their joys are one.


   "Worthy the Lamb that died," they cry,

   "To be exalted thus:"

   "Worthy the Lamb," our lips reply,

   "For he was slain for us."


   Jesus is worthy to receive

   Honor and power divine;

   And blessings more than we can give,

   Be, Lord, for ever thine.


   Let all that dwell above the sky,

   And air, and earth, and seas,

   Conspire to lift thy glories high,

   And speak thine endless praise.


   The whole creation join in one,

   To bless the sacred name

   Of him that sits upon the throne,

   And to adore the Lamb.

   L. M.

   Christ's humiliation and exaltation. Rev. 5:12.


   What equal honors shall we bring

   To thee, O Lord our God, the Lamb,

   When all the notes that angels sing

   Are far inferior to thy name?


   Worthy is he that once was slain,

   The Prince of Peace that groaned and died;

   Worthy to rise, and live, and reign

   At his Almighty Father's side.


   Power and dominion are his due

   Who stood condemned at Pilate's bar;

   Wisdom belongs to Jesus too,

   Though he was charged with madness here.


   All riches are his native right,

   Yet he sustained amazing loss;

   To him ascribe eternal might,

   Who left his weakness on the cross.


   Honor immortal must be paid,

   Instead of scandal and of scorn;

   While glory shines around his head,

   And a bright crown without a thorn.


   Blessings for ever on the Lamb

   Who bore the curse for wretched men;

   Let angels sound his sacred name,

   And every creature say, Amen.

   Adoption. 1 John 3:1ff; Gal. 4:6.


   Behold what wondrous grace

   The Father has bestowed

   On sinners of a mortal race,

   To call them sons of God!


   'Tis no surprising thing

   That we should be unknown;

   The Jewish world knew not their king,

   God's everlasting Son.


   Nor doth it yet appear

   How great we must be made;

   But when we see our Savior here,

   We shall be like our Head.


   A hope so much divine

   May trials well endure;

   May purge our souls from sense and sin,

   As Christ the Lord is pure.


   If in my Father's love

   I share a filial part,

   Send down thy Spirit like a dove,

   To rest upon my heart.


   We would no longer lie

   Like slaves beneath the throne;

   My faith shall Abba, Father, cry,

   And thou the kindred own.

   Kings of the earth, with glad accord,

   Give up your kingdoms to the Lord.


   Almighty God, thy power assume,

   Who wast, and art, and art to come:

   Jesus, the Lamb who once was slain,

   For ever live, for ever reign!


   The angry nations fret and roar,

   That they can slay the saints no more

   On wings of vengeance flies our God,

   To pay the long arrears of blood.

   Exceeds the blessings of the vine.


   On thee th' anointing Spirit came,

   Jesus, allure me by thy charms,

   My soul shall fly into thine arms!

   Our wand'ring feet thy favors bring

   To the fair chambers of the King.


   [Wonder and pleasure tune our voice

   To speak thy praises and our joys;

   Our memory keeps this love of thine

   Beyond the taste of richest wine.]


   Though in ourselves deformed we are,

   And black as Kedar's tents appear,

   Yet, when we put thy beauties on,

   Fair as the courts of Solomon.


   [While at his table sits the King,

   He loves to see us smile and sing;

   Our graces are our best perfume,

   And breathe like spikenard round the room.]


   As myrrh new bleeding from the tree,

   Such is a dying Christ to ine

   And while he makes my soul his guest,

   My bosom, Lord, shall be thy rest.

   Where doth thy sweetest pasture grow?


   Where is the shadow of that rock,

   That from the sun defends thy flock?

   Fain would I feed among thy sheep,

   Among them rest, among them sleep.


   Why should thy bride appear like one

   That turns aside to paths unknown?

   My constant feet would never rove,

   Would never seek another love.


   [The footsteps of thy flock I see;

   Thy sweetest pastures here they be;

   A wondrous feast thy love prepares,

   Bought with thy wounds, and groans, and tears.


   His dearest flesh he makes my food,

   And bids me drink his richest blood:

   Here to these hills my soul will come,

   Till my Beloved lead me home.]

   Behold the Rose of Sharon here,

   The Lily which the valleys bear;

   Behold the Tree of Life, that gives

   Refreshing fruit and healing leaves.


   Amongst the thorns so lilies shine;

   Amongst wild gourds the noble vine;

   So in mine eyes my Savior proves,

   Amidst a thousand meaner loves.


   Beneath his cooling shade I sat,

   To shield me from the burning heat;

   Of heav'ly fruit he spreads a feast,

   To feed mine eyes and please my taste.


   [Kindly he brought me to the place

   Where stands the banquet of his grace;

   He saw me faint, and o'er my head

   The banner of his love he spread.


   With living bread and gen'rous wine,

   He cheers this sinking heart of mine;

   And op'ning his own heart to me,

   He shows his thoughts how kind they be.]


   O never let my Lord depart;

   Lie down, and rest upon my heart;

   Nor stir, nor wake, nor grieve my Love.

   He leaps, he flies to my relief.


   Now through the veil of flesh I see

   With eyes of love he looks at me;

   Now in the gospel's clearest glass

   He shows the beauties of his face.


   Gently he draws my heart along,

   Both with his beauties and his tongue;

   "Rise," saith my Lord, "make haste away,

   No mortal joys are worth thy stay.


   "The Jewish wintry state is gone,

   The mists are fled, the spring comes on;

   The sacred turtle-dove we hear

   Proclaim the new, the joyful year.


   "Th' immortal vine of heav'nly root

   Blossoms, and buds, and gives her fruit:"

   Lo! we are come to taste the wine;

   Our souls rejoice, and bless the vine.


   And when we hear our Jesus say,

   Our hearts would fain outfly the wind,

   And leave all earthly loves behind.

   And let thy voice delight mine ear.


   "Thy voice to me sounds ever sweet;

   'Tis bright and comely in mine eyes."


   Dear Lord, our thankful heart receives

   The hope thine invitation gives;

   To thee our joyful lips shall raise

   [I am my Love's, and he is mine;

   Nor thought, arise to grieve my Lord.


   My soul to pastures fair he leads,

   Amongst the lilies where he feeds

   Amongst the saints, whose robes are white,

   Washed in his blood, is his delight.


   Till the day break, and shadows flee,

   Till the sweet dawning light I see,

   Thine eyes to me-ward often turn,

   Nor let my soul in darkness mourn.

   Often I seek my Lord by night,

   Jesus, my Love, my soul's delight;

   With warm desire and restless thought

   I seek him oft, but find him not.


   Then I arise and search the street,

   Till I my Lord, my Savior meet:

   I ask the watchmen of the night,

   "Where did you see my soul's delight?"


   Sometimes I find him in my way,

   Directed by a heav'nly ray;

   I leap for joy to see his face,

   And hold him fast in mine embrace.


   [I bring him to my mother's home,

   Nor does my Lord refuse to come

   To Zion's sacred chambers, where

   My soul first drew the vital air.


   He gives me there his bleeding heart,

   Pierced for my sake with deadly smart;

   I give my soul to him, and there

   Our loves their mutual tokens share.]

   Daughters of Zion, come, behold

   The crown of honor and of gold

   Which the glad church, with joys unknown,

   Placed on the head of Solomon.


   Jesus, thou everlasting King,

   Accept the tribute which we bring;

   Accept the well-deserved renown,

   And wear our praises as thy crown.


   Let every act of worship be

   Like our espousals, Lord, to thee;

   Like the dear hour when from above

   We first received thy pledge of love.


   The gladness of that happy day,

   Our hearts would wish it long to stay;

   Nor let our faith forsake its hold,

   Nor comfort sink, nor love grow cold.


   Each following minute, as it flies,

   Increase thy praise, improve our joys,

   Till we are raised to sing thy name

   At the great supper of the Lamb.

   "Not the young doves have sweeter eyes."


   ["Sweet are thy lips, thy pleasing voice

   Salutes mine ear with secret joys;

   No spice so much delights the smell,

   Nor milk nor honey tastes so well.]


   "Thou art all fair, my bride, to me,

   I will behold no spot in thee."

   What mighty wonders love performs,

   And puts a comeliness on worms!


   Defiled and loathsome as we are,

   He makes us white, and calls us fair;

   Adorns us with that heav'nly dress,

   His graces and his righteousness.


   "My sister and my spouse," he cries,

   "Bound to my heart by various ties,

   Thy powerful love my heart detains

   In strong delight and pleasing chains."


   He calls me from the leopard's den,

   From this wild world of beasts and men,

   To Zion, where his glories are;

   Not Lebanon is half so fair.


   Nor dens of prey, nor flowery plains,

   Nor earthly joys, nor earthly pains,

   Shall hold my feet or force my stay,

   When Christ invites my soul away.

   The church the garden of Christ. SS 4:12-15; 5:1.


   We are a garden walled around,

   Chosen and made peculiar ground;

   A little spot enclosed by grace

   Out of the world's wide wilderness.


   Like trees of myrrh and spice we stand,

   Planted by God the Father's hand;

   And all his springs in Zion flow,

   To make the young plantation grow.


   Awake, O, heav'nly wind! and come,

   Blow on this garden of perfume;

   Spirit divine! descend and breathe

   A gracious gale on plants beneath.


   Make our best spices flow abroad,

   To entertain our Savior God

   And faith, and love, and joy appear,

   And every grace be active here.


   [Let my Beloved come and taste

   His pleasant fruits at his own feast:

   "I come, my spouse, I come!" he cries,

   With love and pleasure in his eyes.


   Our Lord into his garden comes,

   Well pleased to smell our poor perfumes,

   And calls us to a feast divine,

   Sweeter than honey, milk, or wine.


   "Eat of the tree of life, my friends,

   The blessings that my Father sends;

   Your taste shall all my dainties prove,

   And drink abundance of my love:"


   Jesus, we will frequent thy board,

   The description of Christ the beloved. SS 5:9-16.


   The wond'ring world inquires to know

   Why I should love my Jesus so:

   What are his charms," say they, "above

   The objects of a mortal love?"


   Yes! my Beloved, to my sight

   Shows a sweet mixture, red and white:

   All human beauties, all divine,

   In my Beloved meet and shine.


   White is his soul, from blemish free;

   Red with the blood he shed for me;

   The fairest of ten thousand fairs;

   A sun amongst ten thousand stars.


   [His head the finest gold excels;

   There wisdom in perfection dwells,

   And glory like a crown adorns

   Those temples once beset with thorns.


   Compassions in his heart are found,

   Hard by the signals of his wound:

   His sacred side no more shall bear

   The cruel scourge, the piercing spear.]


   [His hands are fairer to behold

   Than diamonds set in rings of gold;

   Those heav'nly hands, that on the tree

   Were nailed, and torn, and bled for me!


   Though once he bowed his feeble knees,

   Loaded with sins and agonies,

   Now on the throne of his command

   His legs like marble pillars stand.]


   [His eyes are majesty and love,

   The eagle tempered with the dove;

   No more shall trickling sorrows roll

   Through those dear windows of his soul.


   His mouth, that poured out long complaints,

   Now smiles and cheers his fainting saints

   His countenance more graceful is

   Than Lebanon with all its trees.]


   All over glorious is my Lord

   Must be beloved, and yet adored;

   His worth if all the nations knew,

   Sure the whole earth would love him too.

   When strangers stand and hear me tell

   What beauties in my Savior dwell,

   Where he is gone they fain would know,

   That they may seek and love him too.


   My best Beloved keeps his throne

   On hills of light, in worlds unknown;

   But he descends and shows his face

   In the young gardens of his grace.


   [In vineyards planted by his hand,

   Where fruitful trees in order stand;

   He feeds among the spicy beds,

   Where lilies show their spotless heads.


   He has engrossed my warmest love,

   No earthly charms my soul can move:

   I have a mansion in his heart,

   Nor death nor hell shall make us part.]


   [He takes my soul ere I'm aware,

   And shows me where his glories are;

   No chariot of Amminadib

   The heav'nly rapture can describe.

   My love how pleasant for delight!"


   Kind is thy language, sovereign Lord,

   There's heav'nly grace in every word;

   From that dear mouth a stream divine

   Flows sweeter than the choicest wine.


   Such wondrous love awakes the lip

   Of saints that were almost asleep,

   To speak the praises of thy name,

   And makes our cold affections flame.


   These are the joys he lets us know

   In fields and villages below;

   Gives us a relish of his love,

   But keeps his noblest feast above.


   In Paradise, within the gates,

   A higher entertainment waits

   Fruits new and old laid up in store,

   Where we shall feed, but thirst no more.

   Is but the voice of every saint.]


   "O let my name engraven stand

   Both on thy heart and on thy hand;

   Seal me upon thine arm, and wear

   That pledge of love for ever there.


   "Stronger than death thy love is known,

   Which floods of wrath could never drown;

   And hell and earth in vain combine

   To quench a fire so much divine.


   "But I am jealous of my heart,

   Lest it should once from thee depart;

   Then let thy name be well impressed

   As a fair signet on my breast.


   "Till thou hast brought me to thy home,

   Where fears and doubts can never come,

   Thy count'nance let me often see,

   And often thou shalt hear from me.

   To run his journey through the skies.


   From the fair chambers of the east

   Round the whole earth he flies and shines.


   O like the sun may I fulfil

   With ready mind and active will

   March on and keep my heav'nly way.


   [But I shall rove and lose the race,

   If God, my sun, should disappear,

   And leave me in this world's wild maze,

   To follow every wand'ring star.


   Lord, thy commands are clean and pure,

   Enlight'ning our beclouded eyes;

   Thy threat'nings just, thy promise sure,

   Thy gospel makes the simple wise.]

   Thus far the Lord has led me on,

   Thus far his power prolongs my days;

   And every evening shall make known

   Some fresh memorial of his grace.


   Much of my time has run to waste,

   And I perhaps am near my home;

   But he forgives my follies past,

   He gives me strength for days to come.


   I lay my body down to sleep,

   Peace is the pillow for my head;

   While well-appointed angels keep

   Their watchful stations round my bed.


   In vain the sons of earth or hell

   Tell me a thousand frightful things

   My God in safety makes me dwell

   Beneath the shadow of his wings.


   [Faith in his name forbids my fear;

   O may thy presence ne'er depart!

   And in the morning make me hear

   The love and kindness of thy heart.

   C. M.

   God holy, just, and sovereign. Job 9:2-10.


   How should the sons of Adam's race

   Be pure before their God?

   If he contend in righteousness,

   We fall beneath his rod.


   To vindicate my words and thoughts

   I'll make no more pretence;

   Not one of all my thousand faults

   Can bear a just defence.


   Strong is his arm, his heart is wise;

   What vain presumers dare

   Against their Maker's hand to rise,

   Or tempt th' unequal war?


   [Mountains, by his almighty wrath,

   From their old seats are torn;

   He shakes the earth from south to north,

   And all her pillars mourn.


   He bids the sun forbear to rise,

   Th' obedient sun forbears;

   His hand with sackcloth spreads the skies,

   And seals up all the stars.


   He walks upon the stormy sea,

   Flies on the stormy wind;

   There's none can trace his wondrous way,

   Or his dark footsteps find.]

  HYMN 87

   L. M.

   God dwells with the humble and penitent. Isa. 47:15,16.


   Thus saith the high and lofty One:

   "I sit upon my holy throne;

   My name is God, I dwell on high,

   Dwell in my own eternity.


   "But I descend to worlds below,

   On earth I have a mansion too;

   The humble spirit and contrite

   Is an abode of my delight.


   "The humble soul my words revive,

   I bid the mourning sinner live,

   Heal all the broken hearts I find,

   And ease the sorrows of the mind.


   ["When I contend against their sin,

   I make them know how vile they've been;

   But should my wrath for ever smoke,

   Their souls would sink beneath my stroke."]


   O may thy pard'ning grace be nigh,

   Lest we should faint, despair, and die!

   Thus shall our better thoughts approve

   The methods of thy chast'ning love.

  HYMN 88

   L. M.

   Life the day of grace and hope. Eccl. 9:4-6,10.


   Life is the time to serve the Lord,

   The time t' insure the great reward;

   And while the lamp holds out to burn,

   The vilest sinner may return.


   [Life is the hour that God has giv'n

   To 'scape from hell and fly to heav'n;

   The day of grace, and mortals may

   Secure the blessings of the day.]


   The living know that they must die,

   But all the dead forgotten lie;

   Their mem'ry and their sense is gone,

   Alike unknowing and unknown.


   [Their hatred and their love is lost,

   Their envy buried in the dust;

   They have no share in all that's done

   Beneath the circuit of the sun.]


   Then what my thoughts design to do,

   My hands, with all your might pursue;

   Since no device nor work is found,

   Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground.


   There are no acts of pardon passed

   In the cold grave, to which we haste;

   But darkness, death, and long despair,

   Reign in eternal silence there.

   L. M.

   Youth and judgment. Eccl. 11:9.


   Ye sons of Adam, vain and young,

   Indulge your eyes, indulge your tongue,

   Taste the delights your souls desire,

   And give a loose to all your fire;


   Pursue the pleasures you design,

   And cheer your hearts with songs and wine;

   Enjoy the day of mirth, but know

   There is a day of judgment too.


   God from on high beholds your thoughts,

   His book records your secret faults;

   The works of darkness you have done

   Must all appear before the sun.


   The vengeance to your follies due

   Should strike your hearts with terror through:

   How will you stand before his face,

   Or answer for his injured grace?


   Almighty God! turn off their eyes

   From these alluring vanities;

   And let the thunder of thy word

   Awake their souls to fear the Lord.

   Youth and judgment. Eccl. 11:9.


   Lo! the young tribes of Adam rise,

   And through all nature rove

   Fulfil the wishes of their eyes,

   And taste the joys they love.


   They give a loose to wild desires;

   But let the sinners know

   The strict account that God requires

   Of all the works they do.


   The Judge prepares his throne on high,

   The frighted earth and seas

   Avoid the fury of his eye,

   And flee before his face.


   How shall I bear that dreadful day,

   And stand the fiery test?

   I give all mortal joys away,

   To be for ever blessed.

  HYMN 91

   L. M.

   Advice to youth; or, Old age and death in an unconverted state. Eccl.
   12:1,7; Isa. 45:20.


   Now in the heat of youthful blood

   Remember your Creator God:

   Behold, the months come hast'ning on,

   When you shall say, "My joys are gone!"


   Behold, the aged sinner goes,

   Laden with guilt and heavy woes,

   Down to the regions of the dead,

   With endless curses on his head.


   The dust returns to dust again;

   The soul, in agonies of pain,

   Ascends to God, not there to dwell,

   But hears her doom, and sinks to hell.


   Eternal King! I fear thy name;

   Teach me to know how frail I am;

   And when my soul must hence remove,

   Give me a mansion in thy love.

   S. M.

   Christ the wisdom of God. Prov. 8:1,22-32.


   Shall Wisdom cry aloud,

   And not her speech be heard?

   The voice of God's eternal Word,

   Deserves it no regard?


   "I was his chief delight,

   His everlasting Son,

   Before the first of all his works,

   Creation, was begun.


   ["Before the flying clouds,

   Before the solid land,

   Before the fields, before the floods,

   I dwelt at his right hand.


   "When he adorned the skies,

   And built them, I was there,

   To order where the sun should rise,

   And marshal every star.


   "When he poured out the sea,

   And spread the flowing deep,

   I gave the flood a firm decree

   In its own bounds to keep.]


   "Upon the empty air

   The earth was balanced well.

   With joy I saw the mansion where

   The sons of men should dwell.


   "My busy thoughts at first

   On their salvation ran,

   Ere sin was born, or Adam's dust

   Was fashioned to a man.


   "Then come, receive my grace,

   Ye children, and be wise;

   Happy the man that keeps my ways;

   The man that shuns them dies."

   Christ, or Wisdom, obeyed or resisted. Prov. 8:34-36.


   Thus saith the Wisdom of the Lord,

   "Blest is the man that hears my word,

   Keeps daily watch before my gates,

   And at my feet for mercy waits.


   "The soul that seeks me shall obtain

   Immortal wealth and heav'nly gain;

   Immortal life is his reward;

   Life, and the favor of the Lord.


   "But the vile wretch that flies from me

   Doth his own soul an injury;

   Fools that against my grace rebel

   Seek death, and love the road to hell."

   C. M.

   Justification by faith, not by works. Rom. 3:19-22.


   Vain are the hopes the sons of men

   On their own works have built;

   Their hearts by nature all unclean,

   And all their actions guilt.


   Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouths

   Without a murm'ring word,

   And the whole race of Adam stand

   Guilty before the Lord.


   In vain we ask God's righteous law

   To justify us now;

   Since to convince and to condemn

   Is all the law can do.


   Jesus, how glorious is thy grace!

   When in thy name we trust,

   Our faith receives a righteousness

   That makes the sinner just.

   C. M.

   Regeneration. John 1:13; 3:3, etc.


   Not all the outward forms on earth,

   Nor rites that God has giv'n,

   Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth,

   Can raise a soul to heav'n.


   The sovereign will of God alone

   Creates us heirs of grace

   Born in the image of his Son,

   A new, peculiar race.


   The Spirit, like some heav'nly wind,

   Blows on the sons of flesh,

   New-models all the carnal mind,

   And forms the man afresh.


   Our quickened souls awake, and rise

   From the long sleep of death;

   On heav'nly things we fix our eyes,

   And praise employs our breath.

  HYMN 96

   C. M.

   Election excludes boasting. 1 Cor. 1:26-31.


   But few among the carnal wise,

   But few of noble race,

   Obtain the favor of thine eyes,

   Almighty King of Grace.


   He takes the men of meanest name

   For sons and heirs of God;

   And thus he pours abundant shame

   On honorable blood.


   He calls the fool, and makes him know

   The myst'ries of his grace,

   To bring aspiring wisdom low,

   And all its pride abase.


   Nature has all its glories lost

   When brought before his throne;

   No flesh shall in his presence boast,

   But in the Lord alone.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 97

   L. M.

   Christ our wisdom, righteousness, etc. 1 Cor. 1:30.


   Buried in shadows of the night

   We lie till Christ restores the light;

   Wisdom descends to heal the blind,

   And chase the darkness of the mind.


   Our guilty souls are drowned in tears

   Till his atoning blood appears;

   Then we awake from deep distress,

   And sing, "The Lord our Righteousness."


   Our very frame is mixed with sin,

   His Spirit makes our natures clean

   Such virtues from his suff'rings flow,

   At once to cleanse and pardon too.


   Jesus beholds where Satan reigns,

   Binding his slaves in heavy chains;

   He sets the pris'ners free, and breaks

   The iron bondage from our necks.


   Poor helpless worms in thee possess

   Grace, wisdom, power, and righteousness;

   Thou art our mighty All, and we

   Give our whole selves, O Lord, to thee.

   Christ our wisdom, righteousness, etc. 1 Cor. 1:30.


   How heavy is the night

   That hangs upon our eyes,

   Till Christ with his reviving light

   Over our souls arise!


   Our guilty spirits dread

   To meet the wrath of Heav'n;

   But, in his righteousness arrayed,

   We see our sins forgiv'n.


   Unholy and impure

   Are all our thoughts and ways;

   His hands infected nature cure

   With sanctifying grace.


   The powers of hell agree

   To hold our souls in vain;

   He sets the sons of bondage free,

   And breaks the cursed chain


   Lord, we adore thy ways

   To bring us near to God;

   Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace,

   And thine atoning blood.

   Stones made children of Abraham. Matt. 3:9.


   Vain are the hopes that rebels place

   Upon their birth and blood,

   Descended from a pious race;

   Their fathers now with God.


   He from the caves of earth and hell

   Can take the hardest stones,

   And fill the house of Abram well

   With new-created sons.


   Such wondrous power doth he possess

   Who formed our mortal frame,

   Who called the world from emptiness,

   The world obeyed and came.

   Believe and be saved. John 3:16-18.


   Not to condemn the sons of men,

   Did Christ, the Son of God, appear;

   No weapons in his hands are seen,

   No flaming sword nor thunder there.


   Such was the pity of our God,

   He loved the race of man so well,

   He sent his Son to bear our load

   Of sins, and save our souls from hell.


   Sinners, believe the Savior's word,

   Trust in his mighty name and live;

   A thousand joys his lips afford,

   His hands a thousand blessings give.


   But vengeance and damnation lies

   On rebels who refuse the grace;

   Who God's eternal Son despise,

   The hottest hell shall be their place.

   Joy in heaven for a repenting sinner. Luke 15:7,10.


   Who can describe the joys that rise

   Through all the courts of Paradise,

   To see a prodigal return,

   To see an heir of glory born?


   With joy the Father doth approve

   The fruit of his eternal love;

   The Son with joy looks down and sees

   The purchase of his agonies.


   The Spirit takes delight to view

   The holy soul he formed anew;

   And saints and angels join to sing,

   The growing empire of their King.

   [Blest are the humble souls that see

   Treasures of grace to them are giv'n,

   And crowns of joy laid up in heav'n.]


   [Blest are the men of broken heart,

   Who mourn for sin with inward smart

   The blood of Christ divinely flows,

   A healing balm for all their woes.]


   [Blest are the meek, who stand afar

   From rage and passion, noise and war;

   God will secure their happy state,

   And plead their cause against the great.]


   [Blest are the souls that thirst for grace,

   Hunger and long for righteousness;

   They shall be well supplied, and fed

   With living streams and living bread.]


   [Blest are the men whose bowels move

   And melt with sympathy and love;

   From Christ the Lord shall they obtain

   Like sympathy and love again.]


   [Blest are the pure, whose hearts are clean

   From the defiling powers of sin;

   With endless pleasure they shall see

   A God of spotless purity.]


   [Blest are the men of peaceful life,

   Who quench the coals of growing strife;

   They shall be called the heirs of bliss,

   The sons of God, the God of peace.]

   The glory of his cross.


   Jesus, my God! I know his name,

   His name is all my trust;

   Nor will he put my soul to shame,

   Nor let my hope be lost.


   Firm as his throne his promise stands,

   And he can well secure

   What I've committed to his hands

   Till the decisive hour.


   Then will he own my worthless name

   Not the malicious or profane,

   The wanton or the proud,

   Tue kingdom of our God.


   Surprising grace! and such were we

   By nature and by sin,

   Heirs of immortal misery,

   Unholy and unclean.


   But we are washed in Jesus' blood,

   We're pardoned through his name;

   And the good Spirit of our God

   Has sanctified our frame.


   O for a persevering power

   We would defile our hearts no more,

   No more pollute our hands.

   Heaven invisible and holy. 1 Cor. 2:9,10; Rev. 21:27.


   Nor eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard,

   Nor sense nor reason known,

   What joys the Father hath prepared

   For those that love the Son.


   But the good Spirit of the Lord

   Reveals a heav'n to come;

   The beams of glory in his word

   Allure and guide us home.


   Pure are the joys above the sky,

   And all the region peace;

   No wanton lips nor envious eye

   Can see or taste the bliss.


   Those holy gates for ever bar

   Po lution, sin, and shame

   None shall obtain admittance there

   But followers of the Lamb.


   He keeps the Father's book of life,

   There all their names are found;

   S. M.

   Dead to sin by the cross of Christ. Rom. 6:1,2,6.


   Shall we go on to sin

   Because thy grace abounds;

   Or crucify the Lord again,

   And open all his wounds?


   Forbid it, mighty God!

   Nor let it e'er be said,

   That we whose sins are crucified

   Should raise them from the dead.


   We will be slaves no more,

   Since Christ has made us free;

   Has nailed our tyrants to his cross,

   And bought our liberty.

  HYMN 107

   L. M.

   The fall and recovery of man; or, Christ and Satan at enmity. Gen.
   3:1,15,17; Gal. 4:4; Col. 2:15.


   Deceived by subtle snares of hell,

   Adam, our head, our father, fell;

   When Satan, in the serpent hid,

   Proposed the fruit that God forbid.


   Death was the threat'ning: death began

   To take possession of the man

   His unborn race received the wound,

   And heavy curses smote the ground.


   But Satan found a worse reward;

   Thus saith the vengeance of the Lord

   "Let everlasting hatred be

   Betwixt the woman's seed and thee.


   "The woman's seed shall be my Son;

   He shall destroy what thou hast done;

   Shall break thy head, and only feel

   Thy malice raging at his heel."


   He spake; and bid four thousand years

   Roll on; at length his Son appears;

   Angels with joy descend to earth,

   And sing the young Redeemer's birth.


   Lo, by the sons of hell he dies;

   But as he hung 'twixt earth and skies,

   He gave their prince a fatal blow,

   And triumphed o'er the powers below.]

   On earth we want the sight

   Of our Redeemer's face;

   Yet, Lord, our inmost thoughts delight

   And when we taste thy love,

   Our joys divinely grow

   Unspeakable, like those above,

   The value of Christ, and his righteousness. Phil. 3:7-9.


   No more, my God, I boast no more

   Of all the duties I have done;

   I quit the hopes I held before,

   To trust the merits of thy Son.


   Now, for the love I bear his name,

   What was my gain I count my loss;

   My former pride I call my shame,

   And nail my glory to his cross.


   Yes, and I must and will esteem

   All things but loss for Jesus' sake:

   O may my soul be found in him,

   And of his righteousness partake!

   Shortly this prison of my clay

   'Tis he, by his almighty grace,

   That forms thee fit for heav'n;

   Has his own Spirit giv'n.


   We walk by faith of joys to come,

   Faith lives upon his word;

   But while the body is our home,

   We're absent from the Lord.


   'Tis pleasant to believe thy grace,

   On such dry bones as we.

   The brazen serpent; or, Looking to Jesus. John 3:14-16.


   So did the Hebrew prophet raise

   The brazen serpent high,

   The wounded felt immediate ease,

   The camp forbore to die.


   "Look upward in the dying hour,

   And live," the prophet cries;

   But Christ performs a nobler cure,

   When Faith lifts up her eyes.


   High on the cross the Savior hung,

   High in the heav'ns he reigns:

   Here sinners by th' old serpent stung

   Look, and forget their pains.


   When God's own Son is lifted up,

   A dying world revives;

   To Abram and his seed!

   "I'll be a God to thee and thine,

   Supplying all their need."


   The words of his extensive love

   From age to age endure;

   The Angel of the cov'nant proves,

   And seals the blessing sure.


   Jesus the ancient faith confirms,

   To our great fathers giv'n;

   He takes young children to his arms,

   And calls them heirs of heav'n.


   Our God, how faithful are his ways!

   His love endures the same;

   Nor from the promise of his grace

   Blots out the children's name.

   Abraham's blessing on the Gentiles. Rom. 11:16,17.


   Gentiles by nature, we belong

   To the wild olive wood;

   Grace took us from the barren tree,

   And grafts us in the good.


   With the same blessings grace endows

   The Gentile and the Jew;

   If pure and holy be the root,

   Such are the branches too.


   Then let the children of the saints

   Be dedicate to God,

   Pour out thy Spirit on them, Lord,

   And wash them in thy blood.


   Thus to the parents and their seed

   Shall thy salvation come,

   And num'rous households meet at last

   In one eternal home.

   C. M.

   Conviction of sin by the law. Rom. 7:8,9,14,24.


   Lord, how secure my conscience was,

   And felt no inward dread!

   I was alive without the law,

   And thought my sins were dead.


   My hopes of heav'n were firm and bright,

   But since the precept came

   With a convincing power and light,

   I find how vile I am.


   [My guilt appeared but small before,

   Till terribly I saw

   How perfect, holy, just, and pure,

   Was thine eternal law.


   Then felt my soul the heavy load,

   My sins revived again

   I had provoked a dreadful God,

   And all my hopes were slain.]


   I'm like a helpless captive, sold

   Under the power of sin

   I cannot do the good I would,

   Nor keep my conscience clean.


   My God, I cry with every breath

   For some kind power to save,

   To break the yoke of sin and death,

   And thus redeem the slave.

   Love to God and our neighbor. Matt. 22:37-40.


   Thus saith the first, the great command,

   "Let all thy inward powers unite

   To love thy Maker and thy God

   With utmost vigor and delight.


   "Then shall thy neighbor next in place

   Share thine affections and esteem,

   And let thy kindness to thyself

   Measure and rule thy love to him."


   This is the sense that Moses spoke,

   This did the prophets preach and prove;

   For want of this the law is broke,

   And the whole law's fulfilled by love.


   But O! how base our passions are!

   How cold our charity and zeal!

   Lord, fill our souls with heav'nly fire,

   Or we shall ne'er perform thy will.

   Election sovereign and free. Rom. 9:20-23.


   Behold the potter and the clay,

   He forms his vessels as he please:

   Such is our God, and such are we,

   The subjects of his high decrees.


   [Doth not the workman's power extend

   O'er all the mass, which part to choose

   And mold it for a nobler end,

   And which to leave for viler use?]


   May not the sovereign Lord on high

   Dispense his favors as he will,

   Choose some to life, while others die,

   And yet be just and gracious still?


   [What if, to make his terror known,

   He lets his patience long endure,

   Suff'ring vile rebels to go on,

   And seal their own destruction sure?


   What if he means to show his grace,

   And his electing love employs

   To mark out some of mortal race,

   And form them fit for heav'nly joys?]


   Shall man reply against the Lord,

   And call his Maker's ways unjust,

   The thunder of whose dreadful word

   Can crush a thousand worlds to dust?


   But, O my soul! if truths so bright

   Should dazzle and confound thy sight,

   Yet still his written will obey,

   And wait the great decisive day.


   Then shall he make his justice known,

   And the whole world before his throne

   With joy or terror shall confess

   The glory of his righteousness.

  HYMN 118

   S. M.

   Moses and Christ; or, Sins against the law and gospel. John 1:17; Heb.
   3:3,5,6; 10:28,29.


   The law by Moses came,

   But peace, and truth, and love,

   Were brought by Christ, a nobler name,

   Descending from above.


   Amidst the house of God

   Their diff'rent works were done;

   Moses a faithful servant stood,

   But Christ a faithful Son.


   Then to his new commands

   Be strict obedience paid;

   O'er all his Father's house he stands

   The sovereign and the head.


   Ihe man that durst despise

   The law that Moses brought,

   Behold! how terribly he dies

   For his presumptuous fault!


   But sorer vengeance falls

   On that rebellious race,

   Who hate to hear when Jesus calls,

   And dare resist his grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 119

   C. M.

   The different success of the gospel. 1 Cor. 1:23,24; 3:6,7; 2 Cor.
   2:16.


   Christ and his cross is all our theme;

   The myst'ries that we speak

   Are scandal in the Jew's esteem,

   And folly to the Greek.


   But souls enlightened from above

   With joy receive the word;

   They see what wisdom, power, and love

   Shine in their dying Lord.


   The vital savor of his name

   Restores their fainting breath;

   But unbelief perverts the same

   To guilt, despair, and death.


   Till God diffuse his graces down,

   Like showers of heav'nly rain,

   In vain Apollos sows the ground,

   And Paul may plant in vain.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 120

   C. M.

   Faith of things unseen. Heb. 11


   Faith is the brightest evidence

   Of things beyond our sight,

   Breaks through the clouds of flesh and sense,

   And dwells in heav'nly light.


   It sets times past in present view,

   Brings distant prospects home,

   Of things a thousand years ago,

   Or thousand years to come.


   By faith we know the worlds were made

   By God's almighty word;

   Abram, to unknown countries led,

   By faith obeyed the Lord.


   He sought a city fair and high,

   Built by th' eternal hands,

   And faith assures us, though we die,

   That heav'nly building stands.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 121

   C. M.

   Children devoted to God. Gen. 17:7,10; Acts 16:14,15,33.

   [For those who practise infant Baptism.]


   Thus saith the mercy of the Lord,

   "I'll be a God to thee;

   I'll bless thy num'rous race, and they

   Shall be a seed for me."


   Abram believed the promised grace,

   And gave his sons to God;

   But water seals the blessing now,

   That once was sealed with blood.


   Thus Lydia sanctified her house,

   When she received the word;

   Thus the believing jailer gave

   His household to the Lord.


   Thus later saints, eternal King!

   Thine ancient truth embrace;

   To thee their infant offspring bring,

   And humbly claim the grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 122

   L. M.

   Believers buried with Christ in baptism. Rom. 6:3,4, etc.


   Do we not know that solemn word,

   That we are buried with the Lord,

   Baptized into his death, and then

   Put off the body of our sin?


   Our souls receive diviner breath,

   Raised from corruption, guilt, and death;

   So from the grave did Christ arise,

   And lives to God above the skies.


   No more let sin or Satan reign

   Over our mortal flesh again;

   The various lusts we served before

   Shall have dominion now no more.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 123

   C. M.

   The repenting prodigal. Luke 15:13, etc.


   Behold the wretch whose lust and wine

   Had wasted his estate,

   He begs a share among the swine,

   To taste the husks they eat!


   "I die with hunger here," he cries,

   "I starve in foreign lands;

   My father's house has large supplies

   And bounteous are his hands.


   "I'll go, and with a mournful tongue

   Fall down before his face,-

   Father, I've done thy justice wrong,

   Nor can deserve thy grace."


   He said, and hastened to his home,

   To seek his father's love;

   The father saw the rebel come,

   And all his bowels move.


   He ran, and fell upon his neck,

   Embraced and kissed his son;

   The rebel's heart with sorrow brake

   For follies he had done.


   "Take off his clothes of shame and sin,"

   The father gives command,

   "Dress him in garments white and clean,

   With rings adorn his hand.


   "A day of feasting I ordain,

   Let mirth and joy abound;

   My son was dead, and lives again,

   Was lost, and now is found."
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 124

   L. M.

   The first and second Adam. Rom. 5:12, etc.


   Deep in the dust before thy throne

   Our guilt and our disgrace we own;

   Great God! we own th' unhappy name

   Whence sprang our nature and our shame;


   Adam the sinner: at his fall,

   Death like a conqueror seized us

   A thousand new-born babes are dead

   By fatal union to their head.


   But whilst our spirits, filled with awe,

   Behold the terrors of thy law,

   We sing the honors of thy grace,

   That sent to save our ruined race.


   We sing thine everlasting Son,

   Who joined our nature to his own:

   Adam the second from the dust

   Raises the ruins of the first.


   [By the rebellion of one man

   Through all his seed the mischief ran;

   And by one man's obedience now

   Are all his seed made righteous too.]


   Where sin did reign, and death abound,

   There have the sons of Adam found

   Abounding life; there glorious grace

   Reigns through the Lord our righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 125

   C. M.

   Christ's compassion to the weak and tempted. Heb. 4:15,16; 5:7; Matt.
   12:20.


   With joy we meditate the grace

   Of our High Priest above;

   His heart is made of tenderness,

   His bowels melt with love.


   Touched with a sympathy within,

   He knows our feeble frame;

   He knows what sore temptations mean,

   For he has felt the same.


   But spotless, innocent, and pure,

   The great Redeemer stood,

   While Satan's fiery darts he bore,

   And did resist to blood.


   He in the days of feeble flesh

   Poured out his cries and tears,

   And in his measure feels afresh

   What every member bears.


   [He'll never quench the smoking flax,

   But raise it to a flame;

   The bruised reed he never breaks,

   Nor scorns the meanest name.]


   Then let our humble faith address

   His mercy and his power;

   We shall obtain deliv'ring grace

   In the distressing hour.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 126

   L. M.

   Charity and uncharitableness. Rom. 14:17,19; 1 Cor. 10:32.


   Not diff'rent food, or diff'rent dress,

   Compose the kingdom of our Lord;

   But peace, and joy, and righteousness,

   Faith, and obedience to his word.


   When weaker Christians we despise,

   We do the gospel mighty wrong;

   For God, the gracious and the wise,

   Receives the feeble with the strong.


   Let pride and wrath be banished hence;

   Meekness and love our souls pursue;

   Nor shall our practice give offence

   To saints, the Gentile or the Jew.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 127

   L. M.

   Christ's invitation to sinners, or, Humility and pride. Mt. 11:28-30.


   "Come hither, all ye weary souls,

   Ye heavy-laden sinners, come;

   I'll give you rest from all your toils,

   And raise you to my heav'nly home.


   "They shall find rest that learn of me;

   I'm of a meek and lowly mind;

   But passion rages like the sea,

   And pride is restless as the wind.


   "Blest is the man whose shoulders take

   My yoke, and bear it with delight;

   My yoke is easy to his neck

   My grace shall make the burden light."


   Jesus, we come at thy command;

   With faith, and hope, and humble zeal,

   Resign our spirits to thy hand

   To mold and guide us at thy will.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 128

   L. M.

   The apostles' commission. Mark 16:15ff; Matt. 28:18ff.


   "O preach my gospel," saith the Lord,

   "Bid the whole earth my grace receive;

   He shall be saved that trusts my word,

   He shall be damned that won't believe.


   "I'll make your great commission known,

   And ye shall prove my gospel true,

   By all the works that I have done,

   By all the wonders ye shall do.


   "Go heal the sick, go raise the dead,

   Go cast out devils in my name;

   Nor let my prophets be afraid,

   Though Greeks reproach, and Jews blaspheme.


   "Teach all the nations my commands,

   I'm with you till the world shall end;

   All power is trusted to my hands,

   I can destroy, and I defend."


   He spake, and light shone round his head

   On a bright cloud to heav'n he rode;

   They to the farthest nations spread

   The grace of their ascended God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 129

   L. M.

   Submission and deliverance; or, Abraham offering up his son. Gen. 22:6,
   etc.


   Saints, at your heav'nly Father's word

   Give up your comforts to the Lord;

   He shall restore what you resign,

   Or grant you blessings more divine.


   So Abram with obedient hand

   Led forth his son at God's command;

   The wood, the fire, the kiufe, he took,

   His arm prepared the dreadful stroke.


   "Abram, forbear!" the angel cried,

   Thy faith is known, thy love is tried

   Thy son shall live, and in thy seed

   Shall the whole earth be blest indeed."


   Just in the last distressing hour

   Tie Lord displays deliv'ring power;

   The mount of dauger is the place

   Where we shall see surprising grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 130

   L. M.

   Love and hatred. Phil. 2:2; Eph. 4:30, etc.


   Now by the bowels of my God,

   His sharp distress, his sore complaints,

   By his last groans, his dying blood,

   I charge my soul to love the saints.


   Clamor, and wrath, and war, begone,

   Envy and spite, for ever cease;

   Let bitter words no more be known

   Amongst the saints, the sons of peace.


   The Spirit, like a peaceful dove,

   Flies from the realms of noise and strife:

   Why should we vex and grieve his love

   Who seals our souls to heav'nly life?


   Tender and kind be all our thoughts,

   Through all our lives let mercy run;

   So God forgives our num'rous faults,

   For the dear sake of Christ his Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 131

   L. M.

   The Pharisee and publican. Luke 18:10ff.


   Behold how sinners disagree,

   The publican and Pharisee!

   One doth his righteousness proclaim,

   The other owns his guilt and shame.


   This man at humble distance stands,

   And cries for grace with lifted hands

   That boldly rises near the throne,

   And talks of duties he has done.


   The Lord their diff'rent language knows,

   And diff'rent answers he bestows;

   The humble soul with grace he crowns,

   Whilst on the proud his anger frowns.


   Dear Father! let me never be

   Joined with the boasting Pharisee;

   I have no merits of my own

   But plead the suff'rings of thy Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 132

   L. M.

   Holiness and grace. Titus 2:10-13.


   O let our lips and lives express

   The holy gospel we profess;

   So let our works and virtues shine,

   To prove the doctrine all divine.


   Thus shall we best proclaim abroad

   The honors of our Savior God;

   When the salvation reigns within,

   And grace subdues the power of sin.


   Our flesh and sense must be denied,

   Passion and envy, lust and pride;

   While justice, temp'rance, truth, and love,

   Our inward piety approve.


   Religion bears our spirits up,

   While we expect that blessed hope,

   The bright appearance of the Lord,

   And faith stands leaning on his word.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 133

   C. M.

   Love and charity. 1 Cor. 13:2-7, 13.


   Let Pharisees of high esteem

   Their faith and zeal declare,

   All their religion is a dream,

   If love be wanting there.


   Love suffers long with patient eye,

   Nor is provoked in haste;

   She lets the present injury die,

   And long forgets the past.


   [Malice and rage, those fires of hell,

   She quenches with her tongue;

   Hopes and believes, and thinks no ill,

   Though she endure the wrong.]


   [She nor desires nor seeks to know

   The scandals of the time;

   Nor looks with pride on those below,

   Nor envies those that climb.]


   She lays her own advantage by

   To seek her neighbor's good;

   So God's own Son came down to die,

   And bought our lives with blood.


   Love is the grace that keeps her power

   In all the realms above;

   There faith and hope are known no more,

   But saints for ever love.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 134

   L. M.

   Religion vain without love. 1 Cor. 13:1-3.


   Had I the tongues of Greeks and Jews,

   And nobler speech, that angels use,

   If love be absent, I am found,

   Like tinkling brass, an empty sound.


   Were I inspired to preach and tell

   All that is done in heav'n and hell;

   Or could my faith the world remove,

   Still I am nothing without love.


   Should I distribute all my store

   To feed the bowels of the poor,

   Or give my body to the flame,

   To gain a martyr's glorious name;


   If love to God and love to men

   Be absent, all my hopes are vain;

   Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal,

   The work of love can e'er fulfil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 135

   L. M.

   The love of Christ shed abroad in the heart. Eph. 3:16ff.


   Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell

   By faith and love in every breast;

   Then shall we know, and taste, and feel

   The joys that cannot be expressed.


   Come, fill our hearts with inward strength,

   Make our enlarged souls possess,

   And learn the height, and breadth, and length

   Of thine unmeasurable grace.


   Now to the God whose power can do

   More than our thoughts or wishes know,

   Be everlasting honors done

   By all the church, through Christ his Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 136

   C. M.

   Sincerity and hypocrisy; or, formality in worship. John 4:24; Ps.
   139:23,24.


   God is a Spirit, just and wise,

   He sees our inmost mind;

   In vain to beav'n we raise our cries,

   And leave our souls behind.


   Nothing but truth before his throne

   With honor can appear;

   The painted hypocrites are known

   Through the disguise they wear.


   Their lifted eyes salute the skies,

   Their bending knees the ground;

   But God abhors the sacrifice,

   Where not the heart is found.


   Lord, search my thoughts, and try my ways,

   And make my soul sincere

   Then shall I stand before thy face,

   And find acceptance there.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 137

   L. M.

   Salvation by grace in Christ. 2 Tim. 1:9,10.


   Now to the power of God supreme

   Be everlasting honors giv'n;

   He saves from hell, (we bless his name,)

   He calls our wand'ring feet to heav'n.


   Not for our duties or deserts,

   But of his own abounding grace,

   He works salvation in our hearts,

   And forms a people for his praise.


   'Twas his own purpose that begun

   To rescue rebels doomed to die;

   He gave us grace in Christ his Son

   Before he spread the starry sky.


   Jesus the Lord appears at last,

   And makes his Father's counsels known;

   Declares the great transactions past,

   And brings immortal blessings down.


   He dies, and in that dreadful night

   Did all the powers of hell destroy;

   Rising, he brought our heav'n to light,

   And took possession of the joy.

   Saints in the hands of Christ Jn. 10:28,29.


   Firm as the earth thy gospel stands,

   My Lord, my hope, my trust;

   If I am found in Jesus' hands,

   My soul can ne'er be lost.


   His honor is engaged to save

   The meanest of his sheep;

   All that his heav'nly Father gave

   His hands securely keep.


   Nor death nor hell shall e'er remove

   His favorites from his breast;

   In the dear bosom of his love

   They must for ever rest.

  HYMN 139

   L. M.

   Hope in the covenant; or, God's promise and truth unchangeable. Heb.
   6:17-19.


   How oft have sin and Satan strove

   To rend my soul from thee, my God!

   But everlasting is thy love,

   And Jesus seals it with his blood.


   The oath and promise of the Lord

   Join to confirm the wondrous grace;

   Eternal power performs the word,

   And fills all heav'n with endless praise.


   Amidst temptations sharp and long,

   My soul to this dear refuge flies;

   Hope is my anchor, firm and strong,

   While tempests blow and billows rise.


   The gospel bears my spirit up;

   A faithful and unchanging God

   Lays the foundation for my hope

   In oaths, and promises, and blood.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 140

   C. M.

   A living and a dead faith. Collected from several scriptures.


   Mistaken souls, that dream of heav'n,

   And make their empty boast

   Of inward joys, and sins forgiv'n,

   While they are slaves to lust!


   Vain are our fancies, airy flights,

   If faith be cold and dead;

   None but a living power unites

   To Christ the living head.


   'Tis faith that changes all the heart;

   'Tis faith tbat works by love;

   That bids all sinful joys depart,

   And lifts the thoughts above.


   'Tis faith that conquers earth and hell

   By a celestial power;

   This is the grace that shall prevail

   In the decisive hour.


   [Faith must obey her Father's will,

   As well as trust his grace;

   A pard'ning God is jealous still

   For his own holiness.]


   When from the curse he sets us free,

   He makes our natures clean;

   Nor would he send his Son to be

   The minister of sin.


   [His Spirit purifies our frame,

   And seals our peace with God;

   Jesus and his salvation came

   By water and by blood.]

  HYMN 141

   S. M.

   The Humiliation and exaltation of Christ. Isa. 53:1-5,10-12.


   Who has believed thy word,

   Or thy salvation known?

   Reveal thine arm, Almighty Lord,

   And glorify thy Son.


   The Jews esteemed him here

   Too mean for their belief;

   Sorrows his chief acquaintance were,

   And his companion, grief.


   They turned their eyes away,

   And treated him with scorn;

   But 'twas their grief upon him lay,

   Their sorrows he has borne.


   'Twas for the stubborn Jews,

   And Gentiles then unknown,

   The God of justice pleased to bruise

   His best-beloved Son.


   "But I'll prolong his days,

   And make his kingdom stand;

   My pleasure," saith the God of grace,

   "Shall prosper in his hand."


   ["His joyful soul shall see

   The purchase of his pain

   And by his knowledge justify

   The guilty sons of men.]


   ["Ten thousand captive slaves,

   Released from death and sin,

   Shall quit their prisons and their graves

   And own his power divine.]


   ["Heav'n shall advance my Son

   To joys that earth denied;

   Who saw the follies men had done,

   And bore their sins, and died."]

  HYMN 142

   S. M.

   The humiliation and exaltation of Christ. Isa. 53:6-9,12.


   Like sheep we went astray,

   And broke the fold of God,

   Each wand'ring in a diff'rent way,

   But all the downward road.


   How dreadful was the hour

   When God our wand'rings laid,

   And did at once his vengeance pour,

   Upon the Shepherd's head!


   How glorious was the grace

   When Christ sustained the stroke

   His life and blood the Shepherd pays

   A ransom for the flock.


   His honor and his breath

   Were taken both away,

   Joined with the wicked in his death,

   And made as vile as they.


   But God shall raise his head

   O'er all the sons of men,

   And make him see a num'rous seed,

   To recompense his pain.


   "I'll give him," saith the Lord,

   A portion with the strong;

   He shall possess a large reward,

   And hold his honors long."

  HYMN 143

   C. M.

   Characters of the children of God. From several scriptures.


   So new-born babes desire the breast,

   To feed, and grow, and thrive;

   So saints with joy the gospel taste,

   And by the gospel live.


   [With inward gust their heart approves

   All that the word relates;

   They love the men their Father loves,

   And hate the works he hates.]


   [Not all the flatt'ring baits on earth

   Can make them slaves to lust;

   They can't forget their heav'nly birth,

   Nor grovel in the dust.


   Not all the chains that tyrants use

   Shall bind their souls to vice;

   Faith, like a conqueror, can produce

   A thousand victories.]


   [Grace, like an uncorrupting seed,

   Abides and reigns within;

   Immortal principles forbid

   The sons of God to sin.]


   [Not by the terrors of a slave

   Do they perform his will,

   But with the noblest powers they have

   His sweet commands fulfil.]


   They find access at every hour

   To God within the veil;

   Hence they derive a quick'ning power,

   And joys that never fail.


   O happy souls! O glorious state

   Of overflowing grace!

   To dwell so near their Father's seat,

   And see his lovely face!


   Lord, I address thy heav'nly throne;

   Call me a child of thine;

   Send down the Spirit of thy Son

   To form my heart divine.


   There shed thy choicest loves abroad,

   And make my comforts strong:

   Then shall I say, "My Father God!"

   With an unwav'ring tongue.

   The witnessing and sealing Spirit. Rom. 8:14,16; Eph. 1:13,14.


   Why should the children of a King

   Go mourning all their days?

   Great Comforter! descend and bring

   Some tokens of thy grace.


   Dost thou not dwell in all the saints,

   And seal the heirs of heav'n?

   When wilt thou banish my complaints,

   And show my sins forgiv'n?


   Assure my conscience of her part

   In the Redeemer's blood

   And bear thy witness with my heart,

   That I am born of God.


   Thou art the earnest of his love,

   The pledge of joys to come;

   And thy soft wings, celestial Dove,

   Will safe convey me home.

   Christ and Aaron. Heb. 7; 9.


   Jesus, in thee our eyes behold

   A thousand glories more,

   Than the rich gems and polished gold

   The sons of Aaron wore.


   They first their own burnt-offerings brought,

   To purge themselves from sin;

   Thy life was pure without a spot,

   And all thy nature clean.


   [Fresh blood as constant as the day

   Was on their altar spilt;

   But thy one offering takes away

   For ever all our guilt.]


   [Their priesthood ran through several hands,

   For mortal was their race;

   Thy never-changing office stands

   Eternal as thy days.]


   [Once in the circuit of a year,

   With blood, but not his own,

   Aaron within the veil appears

   Before the golden throne:


   But Christ, by his own powerful blood,

   Ascends above the skies,

   And in the presence of our God

   Shows his own sacrifice.]


   Jesus, the King of glory, reigns

   On Zion's heav'nly hill;

   Looks like a lamb that has been slain,

   And wears his priesthood still.


   He ever lives to intercede

   Before his Father's face:

   Give him, my soul, thy cause to plead,

   Nor doubt the Father's grace.

  HYMN 146

   L. M.

   Characters of Christ; borrowed from inanimate things in Scripture.


   Go, worship at Immanuel's feet,

   See in his face what wonders meet!

   Earth is too narrow to express

   His worth, his glory, or his grace.


   [The whole creation can afford

   But some faint shadows of my Lord;

   Nature, to make his beauties known,

   Must mingle colors not her own.]


   [Is he compared to wine or bread?

   Dear Lord, our souls would thus be fed

   That flesh, that dying blood of thine,

   Is bread of life, is heav'nly wine.]


   [Is he a tree? The world receives

   Salvation from his healing leaves;

   That righteous branch, that fruitful bough,

   Is David's root and offspring too.]


   [Is he a rose? Not Sharon yields

   Such fragrancy in all her fields:

   Or if the lily he assume,

   The valleys bless the rich perfume.]


   [Is he a vine? His heav'nly root

   Supplies the boughs with life and fruit

   O let a lasting union join

   My soul the branch to Christ the vine!]


   [Is he the head? Each member lives,

   And owns the vital powers he gives;

   The saints below and saints above

   Joined by his Spirit and his love.]


   [Is he a fountain? There I bathe,

   And heal the plague of sin and death

   These waters all my soul renew,

   And cleanse my spotted garments too.]


   [Is he a fire? He'll purge my dross;

   But the true gold sustains no loss:

   Like a refiner shall he sit,

   And tread the refuse with his feet.]


   [Is he a rock? How firm he proves!

   The Rock of ages never moves;

   Yet the sweet streams that from him flow

   Attend us all the desert through.]


   [Is he a way? He leads to God,

   The path is drawn in lines of blood;

   There would I walk with hope and zeal,

   Till I arrive at Zion's hill.]


   [Is he a door? I'll enter in

   Behold the pastures large and green,

   A paradise divinely fair;

   None but the sheep have freedom there.]


   [Is he designed the corner-stone,

   For men to build their heav'n upon?

   I'll make him my foundation too,

   Nor fear the plots of hell below.]


   [Is he a temple? I adore

   Th' indwelling majesty and power

   And still to this most holy place,

   Whene'er I pray, I turn my face.]


   [Is he a star? He breaks the night

   Piercing the shades with dawning light;

   I know his glories from afar,

   I know the bright, the morning star.]


   [Is he a sun? His beams are grace,

   His course is joy and righteousness;

   Nations rejoice when he appears

   To chase their clouds and dry their tears.


   O let me climb those higher skies,

   Where storms and darkness never rise!

   There he displays his power abroad,

   And shines and reigns th' incarnate God.]


   Nor earth, nor seas, nor sun, nor stars,

   Nor heav'n, his full resemblance bears;

   His beauties we can never trace,

   Till we behold him face to face.

   The names and titles of Christ. From several scriptures.


   ['Tis from the treasures of his word

   I borrow titles for my Lord;

   Nor art nor nature can supply

   Sufficient forms of majesty.


   Bright image of the Father's face,

   Shining with undiminished rays;

   Th' eternal God's eternal Son,

   The heir and partner of his throne.]


   The King of kings, the Lord most high,

   Writes his own name upon his thigh

   He wears a garment dipped in blood,

   And breaks the nations with his rod.


   Where grace can neither melt nor move,

   The Lamb resents his injured love;

   Awakes his wrath without delay,

   And Judah's Lion tears the prey.


   But when for works of peace he comes,

   What winning titles he assumes!

   Light of the world, and Life of men;

   Nor bears those characters in vain.


   With tender pity in his heart,

   He acts the Mediator's part;

   A Friend and Brother he appears,

   And well fulfils the names he wears.


   At length the Judge his throne ascends,

   Divides the rebels from his friends,

   And saints in full fruition prove

   His rich variety of love.

   In Jesus we behold

   His Father's glorious face,

   Shining for ever bright,

   With mild and lovely rays

   Th' eternal God's eternal Son

   Inherits and partakes the throne.]


   The sovereign King of kings,

   The Lord of lords most high,

   Writes his own name upon

   His garment and his thigh:

   His name is called The Word of God;

   He rules the earth with iron rod.


   Where promises and grace

   Can neither melt nor move,

   The angry Lamb resents

   The injuries of his love;

   Awakes his wrath without delay,

   As lions roar, and tear the prey.


   But when for works of peace

   The great Redeemer comes,

   What gentle characters,

   What titles he assumes!

   Light of the world, and Life of men;

   Nor will he bear those names in vain.


   Immense compassion reigns

   In our Immanuel's heart,

   When he descends to act

   A Mediator's part:

   He is a Friend and Brother too;

   Divinely kind, divinely true.


   At length the Lord the Judge

   His awful throne ascends,

   And drives the rebels far

   From favorites and friends:

   Then shall the saints completely prove

   The heights and depths of all his love.

  HYMN 1

   L. M.

   A song of praise to God from Great Britain.


   Nature, with all her powers, shall sing,

   God the Creator and the King;

   Nor air, nor earth, nor skies, nor seas,

   Deny the tribute of their praise.


   [Begin to make his glories known,

   Ye seraphs that sit near his throne;

   Tune your harps high, and spread the sound

   To the creation's utmost bound.


   All mortal things of meaner frame,

   Exert your force, and own his name;

   Whilst with our souls and with our voice

   We sing his honors and our joys.]


   [To him be sacred all we have,

   From the young cradle to the grave;

   Our lips shall his loud wonders tell,

   And every word a miracle.]


   [This northern isle, our native land,

   Lies safe in God th' Almighty's hand;

   Our foes of victory dream in vain,

   And wear the captivating chain.


   He builds and guards the British throne,

   And makes it gracious like his own;

   Makes our successive princes kind,

   And gives our dangers to the wind.]


   Raise monumental praises high

   To him that thunders through the sky,

   And with an awful nod or frown

   Shakes an aspiring tyrant down.


   [Pillars of lasting brass proclaim

   The triumphs of th' Eternal name;

   While trembling nations read from far

   The honors of the God of war.]


   Thus let our flaming zeal employ

   Our loftiest thoughts and loudest songs;

   Britain, pronounce with warmest joy

   Hosannah from ten thousand tongues.


   Yet, mighty God! our feeble frame

   Attempts in vain to reach thy name;

   The strongest notes that angels raise,

   Faint in the worship and the praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 2

   C. M.

   The death of a sinner.


   My thoughts on aweful subjects roll,

   Damnation and the dead;

   What horrors seize the guilty soul

   Upon a dying bed!


   Ling'ring about these mortal shores,

   She makes a long delay,

   Till, like a flood, with rapid force

   Death sweeps the wretch away.


   Then swift and dreadful she descends

   Down to the fiery coast,

   Amongst abominable fiends,

   Herself a frightful ghost.


   There endless crowds of sinners lie,

   And darkness makes their chains;

   Tortured with keen despair they cry,

   Yet wait for fiercer pains.


   Not all their anguish and their blood

   For their old guilt atones,

   Nor the compassion of a God

   Shall hearken to their groans.


   Amazing grace! that kept my breath,

   Nor bid my soul remove,

   Till I had learned my Savior's death,

   And well insured his love!
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 3

   C. M.

   The death and burial of a saint.


   Why do we mourn departing friends,

   Or shake at death's alarms?

   'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends

   To call them to his arms.


   Are we not tending upward too

   As fast as time can move?

   Nor would we wish the hours more slow

   To keep us from our love.


   Why should we tremble to convey

   Their bodies to the tomb?

   There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,

   And left a long perfume.


   The graves of all his saints he blessed,

   And softened every bed;

   Where should the dying members rest,

   But with the dying Head?


   Thence he arose, ascending high,

   And showed our feet the way;

   Up to the Lord our flesh shall fly,

   At the great rising day.


   Then let the last loud trumpet sound,

   And bid our kindred rise;

   Awake, ye nations under ground;

   Ye saints, ascend the skies.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 4

   L. M.

   Salvation in the cross.


   Here at thy cross, my dying God,

   I lay my soul beneath thy love,

   Beneath the droppings of thy blood,

   Jesus, nor shall it e'er remove.


   Not all that tyrants think or say,

   With rage and lightning in their eyes,

   Nor hell shall fright my heart away,

   Should hell with all its legions rise.


   Should worlds conspire to drive me thence,

   Moveless and firm this heart should lie;

   Resolved, (for that's my last defence,)

   If I must perish, there to die.


   But speak, my Lord, and calm my fear;

   Am I not safe beneath thy shade?

   Thy vengeance will not strike me here,

   Nor Satan dares my soul invade.


   Yes, I'm secure beneath thy blood,

   And all my foes shall lose their aim:

   Hosannah to my dying God,

   And my best honors to his name.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 5

   L. M.

   Longing to praise Christ better.


   Lord, when my thoughts with wonder roll

   O'er the sharp sorrows of thy soul,

   And read my Maker's broken laws

   Repaired and honored by thy cross;


   When I behold death, hell, and sin

   Vanquished by that dear blood of thine,

   And see the Man that groaned and died

   Sit glorious by his father's side;


   My passions rise and soar above,

   I'm winged with faith, and fired with love;

   Fain would I reach eternal things,

   And learn the notes that Gabriel sings.


   But my heart fails, my tongue complains,

   For want of their immortal strains

   And, in such humble notes as these,

   Must fall below thy victories.


   Well, the kind minute must appear

   When we shall leave these bodies here,

   These clogs of clay, and mount on high,

   To join the songs above the sky.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 6

   C. M.

   A morning song.


   Once more, my soul, the rising day

   Salutes thy waking eyes;

   Once more, my voice, thy tribute pay

   To him that rules the skies.


   Night unto night his name repeats,

   The day renews the sound,

   Wide as the heav'n on which he sits,

   To turn the seasons round.


   'Tis he supports my mortal frame,

   My tongue shall speak his praise;

   My sins would rouse his wrath to flame,

   And yet his wrath delays.


   [On a poor worm thy power might tread,

   And I could ne'er withstand;

   Thy justice might have crushed me dead,

   But mercy held thine hand.


   A thousand wretched souls are fled

   Since the last setting sun,

   And yet thou length'nest out my thread,

   And yet my moments run.]


   Dear God, let all my hours be thine,

   Whilst I enjoy the light,

   Then shall my sun in smiles decline,

   And bring a pleasing night.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 7

   C. M.

   An evening song.


   [Dread Sovereign! let my evening song

   Like holy incense rise;

   Assist the offerings of my tongue

   To reach the lofty skies.


   Through all the dangers of the day

   Thy hand was still my guard,

   And still to drive my wants away

   Thy mercy stood prepared.]


   Perpetual blessings from above

   Encompass me around,

   But O how few returns of love

   Hath my Creator found!


   What have I done for him that died

   To save my wretched soul?

   How are my follies multiplied,

   Fast as my minutes roil


   Lord, with this guilty heart of mine

   To thy dear cross I flee;

   And to thy grace my soul resign,

   To be renewed by thee.


   Sprinkled afresh with pard'ning blood,

   I lay me down to rest,

   As in th' embraces of my God,

   Or on my Savior's breast.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 8

   C. M.

   A hymn for morning or evening.


   Hosannah, with a cheerful sound,

   To God's upholding hand;

   Ten thousand snares attend us round,

   And yet secure we stand.


   That was a most amazing power

   That raised us with a word,

   And every day and every hour

   We lean upon the Lord.


   The evening rests our weary head,

   And angels guard the room;

   We wake, and we admire the bed

   That was not made our tomb.


   The rising morning can't assure

   That we shall end the day;

   For death stands ready at the door

   To seize our lives away.


   Our breath is forfeited by sin

   To God's avenging law;

   We own thy grace, immortal King,

   In every gasp we draw.


   God is our sun, whose daily light

   Our joy and safety brings;

   Our feeble flesh lies safe at night

   Beneath his shady wings.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 9

   C. M.

   Godly sorrow arising from the sufferings of Christ.


   Alas! and did my Savior bleed?

   And did my Sovereign die?

   Would he devote that sacred head

   For such a worm as I?


   [Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, thine,

   And bathed in its own blood,

   While all exposed to wrath divine

   The glorious Suff'rer stood!]


   Was it for crimes that I had done

   He groaned upon the tree?

   Amazing pity! grace unknown!

   And love beyond degree!


   Well might the sun in darkness hide,

   And shut his glories in,

   When God, the mighty Maker, died

   For man, the creature's sin.


   Thus might I hide my blushing face,

   While his dear cross appears;

   Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,

   And melt my eyes to tears.


   But drops of grief can ne'er repay

   The debt of love I owe;

   Here, Lord, I give myself away;

   'Tis all that I can do.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 10

   C. M.

   Parting with carnal joys.


   My soul forsakes her vain delight,

   And bids the world farewell,

   Base as the dirt beneath my feet,

   And mischievous as hell.


   No longer will I ask your love,

   Nor seek your friendship more;

   The happiness that I approve

   Lies not within your power.


   There's nothing round this spacious earth

   That suits my large desire

   To boundless joy and solid mirth

   My nobler thoughts aspire.


   [Where pleasure rolls its living flood,

   From sin and dross refined,

   Still springing from the throne of God,

   And fit to cheer the mind;


   Th' Almighty Ruler of the sphere,

   The glorious and the great,

   Brings his own all-sufficience there,

   To make our bliss complete.]


   Had I the pinions of a dove,

   I'd climb the heav'nly road;

   There sits my Savior dressed in love,

   And there my smiling God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 11

   L. M.

   Parting with carnal joys.


   I send the joys of earth away;

   Away, ye tempters of the mind!

   False as the smooth, deceitful sea,

   And empty as the whistling wind.


   Your streams were floating me along

   Down to the gulf of black despair,

   And whilst I listened to your song,

   Your streams had e'en conveyed me there.


   Lord, I adore thy matchless grace,

   That warned me of that dark abyss,

   That drew me from those treach'rous seas,

   And bid me seek superior bliss.


   Now to the shining realms above

   I stretch my hands and glance mine eyes;

   O for the pinions of a dove,

   To bear me to the upper skies!


   There, from the bosom of my God,

   Oceans of endless pleasure roll;

   There would I fix my last abode,

   And drown the sorrows of my soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 12

   C. M.

   Christ is the substance of the Levitical priesthood.


   The true Messiah now appears,

   The types are all withdrawn;

   So fly the shadows and the stars

   Before the rising dawn.


   No smoking sweets, nor bleeding lambs,

   Nor kid nor bullock slain;

   Incense and spice of costly names

   Would all be burnt in vain.


   Aaron must lay his robes away,

   His mitre and his vest,

   When God himself comes down to be

   The offering and the priest.


   He took our mortal flesh, to show

   The wonders of his love;

   For us he paid his life below,

   And prays for us above.


   "Father," he cries, "forgive their sins,

   For I myself have died;"

   And then he shows his opened veins,

   And pleads his wounded side.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 13

   L. M.

   The creation, preservation, dissolution, and restoration of this world.


   Sing to the Lord that built the skies,

   The Lord that reared this stately frame;

   Let all the nations sound his praise,

   And lands unknown repeat his name.


   He formed the seas, and formed the hills,

   Made every drop, and every dust,

   Nature and time, with all their wheels,

   And pushed them into motion first.


   Now from his high imperial throne

   He looks far down upon the spheres;

   He bids the shining orbs roll on,

   And round he turns our hasty years.


   Thus shall this moving engine last

   Till all his saints are gathered in;

   Then for the trumpet's dreadful blast,

   To shake it all to dust again!


   Yet, when the sound shall tear the skies,

   And lightning burn the globe below,

   Saints, you may lift your joyful eyes,

   There's a new heav'n and earth for you.

   The Lord's day; or, Delight in ordinances.


   Welcome, sweet day of rest,

   That saw the Lord arise;

   Welcome to this reviving breast,

   And these rejoicing eyes!


   The King himself comes near,

   And feasts his saints today;

   Here we may sit, and see him here,

   And love, and praise, and pray.


   One day amidst the place

   Where my dear God hath been,

   Is sweeter than ten thousand days

   Of pleasurable sin.


   My willing soul would stay

   In such a frame as this,

   My heart grows warm with holy fire,

   And kindles with a pure desire:

   Come, my dear Jesus, from above,

   And feed my soul with heav'nly love.


   [The trees of life immortal stand

   In fragrant rows at thy right hand;

   And in sweet murmurs, by their side,

   Rivers of bliss perpetual glide.


   Haste, then, but with a smiling face,

   And spread the table of thy grace;

   Bring down a taste of fruit divine,

   And cheer my heart with sacred wine.]


   Blest Jesus, what delicious fare!

   How sweet thy entertainments are!

   Never did angels taste above

   Redeeming grace, and dying love.


   Hail, great Immanuel, all divine!

   Lord, how we love thy charming name!


   When I can say, "My God is mine,"

   When I can feel thy glories shine,

   I tread the world beneath my feet,

   And all that earth calls good or great.


   While such a scene of sacred joys

   Our raptured eyes and souls employs,

   Here we could sit, and gaze away

   A long, an everlasting day.


   Well, we shall quickly pass the night

   To the fair coasts of perfect light;

   Then shall our joyful senses rove

   O'er the dear object of our love.


   [There shall we drink full draughts of bliss,

   And pluck new life from heav'nly trees:

   Yet now and then, dear Lord, bestow

   A drop of heav'n on worms below.


   Send comforts down from thy right hand,

   While we pass through this barren land,

   And in thy temple let us see

   A glimpse of love, a glimpse of thee.]

   C. M.

   God's eternity.


   Rise, rise, my soul, and leave the ground,

   Stretch all thy thoughts abroad,

   And rouse up every tuneful sound

   To praise th' eternal God.


   Long ere the lofty skies were spread,

   Jehovah filled his throne;

   Or Adam formed, or angels made,

   The Maker lived alone.


   His boundless years can ne'er decrease,

   But still maintain their prime;

   Eternity's his dwelling-place,

   And ever is his time.


   While like a tide our minutes flow,

   The present and the past,

   He fills his own immortal now,

   And sees our ages waste.


   The sea and sky must perish too,

   And vast destruction come;

   The creatures-look! how old they grow,

   And wait their fiery doom!


   Well, let the sea shrink all away,

   And flame melt down the skies,

   My God shall live an endless day,

   When th' old creation dies.

   L. M.

   The ministry of angels.


   High on a hill of dazzling light

   The King of glory spreads his seat,

   And troops of angels stretched for flight

   Stand waiting round his awful feet.


   "Go," saith the Lord, "my Gabriel, go,

   Salute the virgin's fruitful womb;

   Make haste, ye cherubs, down below,

   Sing and proclaim the Savior come.


   Here a bright squadron leaves the skies,

   And thick around Elisha stands

   Anon a heav'nly soldier flies,

   And breaks the chains from Peter's hands.


   Thy winged troops, O God of hosts!

   Wait on thy wand'ring church below

   Here we are sailing to thy coasts;

   Let angels be our convoy too.


   Are they not all thy servants, Lord?

   At thy command they go and come;

   With cheerful haste obey thy word,

   And guard thy children to their home.

   Our frail bodies, and God our Preserver.


   Let others boast how strong they be,

   Nor death nor danger fear;

   But we'll confess, O Lord, to thee,

   What feeble things we are.


   Fresh as the grass our bodies stand,

   And flourish bright and gay;

   A blasting wind sweeps o'er the land,

   And fades the grass away.


   Our life contains a thousand springs,

   And dies if one be gone;

   Strange, that a harp of thousand strings

   Should keep in tune so long!


   But 'tis our God supports our frame,

   The God that built us first:

   Salvation to th' Almighty name

   That reared us from the dust.


   [He spoke, and straight our hearts and brains

   In all their motions rose;

   "Let blood," said he, "flow round the veins,"

   And round the veins it flows.


   While we have breath, or use our tongues,

   Our Maker we'll adore;

   His Spirit moves our heaving lungs,

   Or they would breathe no more.]

   Backslidings and returns; or, The inconstancy of our love.


   Why is my heart so far from thee,

   My God, my chief delight?

   Why are my thoughts no more by day

   With thee, no more by night?


   [Why should my foolish passions rove?

   Where can such sweetness be

   As I have tasted in thy love,

   As I have found in thee?]


   When my forgetful soul renews

   The savor of thy grace,

   My heart presumes I cannot lose

   The relish all my days.


   But ere one fleeting hour is passed,

   The flatt'ring world employs

   Some sensual bait to seize my taste,

   And to pollute my joys.


   [Trifles of nature or of art,

   With fair, deceitful charms,

   Intrude into my thoughtless heart,

   And thrust me from thy arms.]


   Then I repent, and vex my soul

   That I should leave thee so:

   Where will those wild affections roll

   That let a Savior go?


   [Sin's promised joys are turned to pain,

   And I am drowned in grief;

   But my dear Lord returns again,

   He flies to my relief.


   Seizing my soul with sweet surprise,

   He draws with loving bands

   Divine compassion in his eyes,

   And pardon in his hands.]


   [Wretch that I am, to wander thus

   In chase of false delight!

   Let me be fastened to thy cross,

   Rather than lose thy sight.]


   [Make haste, my days, to reach the goal,

   And bring my heart to rest

   On the dear center of my soul,

   My God, my Savior's breast.]

   A song of praise to God the Redeemer.


   Let the old heathens tune their song

   Of great Diana and of Jove;

   But the sweet theme that moves my tongue

   Is my Redeemer and his love.


   Behold, a God descends and dies

   To save my soul from gaping hell:

   How the black gulf where Satan lies

   Yawned to receive me when I fell!


   How justice frowned, and vengeance stood

   To drive me down to endless pain!

   But the great Son proposed his blood,

   And heav'nly wrath grew mild again.


   Infinite Lover! gracious Lord!

   To thee be endless honors giv'n;

   Thy wondrous name shall be adored

   Round the wide earth and wider heav'n.

   Terrible God, that reign'st on high,

   How awful is thy thund'ring hand!

   Thy fiery bolts, how fierce they fly!

   Nor can all earth or hell withstand.


   This the old rebel angels knew,

   And Satan fell beneath thy frown;

   Thine arrows struck the traitor through,

   And weighty vengeance sunk him down.


   This Sodom felt, and feels it still,

   And roars beneath th' eternal load:

   "With endless burnings who can dwell?

   Or bear the fury of a God?"


   Tremble, ye sinners, and submit,

   Throw down your arms before his throne;

   Bend your heads low beneath his feet,

   Or his strong hand shall crush you down.


   And ye, blest saints, that love him too,

   With rev'rence bow before his name;

   Thus all his heav'nly servants do:

   God is a bright and burning flame.

   Descend from heav'n, immortal Dove,

   Stoop down and take us on thy wings,

   And mount and bear us far above

   The reach of these inferior things:


   Beyond, beyond this lower sky,

   Up where eternal ages roll;

   Where solid pleasures never die,

   And fruits immortal feast the soul.


   O for a sight, a pleasing sight

   Of our Almighty Father's throne!

   There sits our Savior crowned with light,

   Clothed in a body like our own.


   Adoring saints around him stand,

   And thrones and powers before him fall;

   The God shines gracious through the man,

   And sheds sweet glories on them all.


   O what amazing joys they feel

   While to their golden harps they sing,

   And sit on every heav'nly hill,

   And spread the triumphs of their King!


   When shall the day, dear Lord, appear,

   That I shall mount to dwell above,

   And stand and bow amongst them there,

   And view thy face, and sing, and love?

   The evil of sin visible in the fall of angels and men.


   When the great Builder arched the skies,

   And formed all nature with a word,

   The joyful cherubs tuned his praise,

   And every bending throne adored.


   High in the midst of all the throng,

   Satan, a tall archangel, sat;

   Amongst the morning stars he sung,

   Till sin destroyed his heav'nly state.


   ['Twas sin that hurled him from his throne;

   Grov'lling in fire the rebel lies:

   "How art thou sunk in darkness down,

   Son of the morning, from the skies!"]


   And thus our two first parents stood,

   Till sin defiled the happy place;

   They lost their garden and their God,

   And ruined all their unborn race.


   [So sprung the plague from Adam's bower,

   And spread destruction all abroad;

   Sin, the cursed name, that in one hour

   Spoiled six days' labor of a God!]


   Tremble, my soul, and mourn for grief,

   That such a foe should seize thy breast;

   Fly to thy Lord for quick relief;

   Oh may he slay this treach'rous guest!


   Then to thy throne, victorious King,

   Then to thy throne our shouts shall rise!

   Thine everlasting arm we sing;

   For sin, the monster, bleeds and dies.

   Complaining of spiritual sloth.


   My drowsy powers, why sleep ye so?

   Awake, my sluggish soul!

   Nothing has half thy work to do,

   Yet nothing's half so dull.


   The little ants for one poor grain

   Labor, and tug, and strive;

   Yet we, who have a heav'n t' obtain,

   How negligent we live!


   We, for whose sake all nature stands,

   And stars their courses move;

   We, for whose guard the angel bands

   Come flying from above;


   We, for whom God the Son came down

   And labored for our good,

   How careless to secure that crown

   He purchased with his blood!


   Lord, shall we lie so sluggish still,

   And never act our parts?

   Come, holy Dove, from th' heav'nly hill,

   And sit and warm our hearts.


   Then shall our active spirits move,

   Upward our souls shall rise;

   With hands of faith and wings of love

   We'll fly and take the prize.

   Lord, we are blind, we mortals blind,

   We can't behold thy bright abode;

   To glance a thought half way to God!


   Infinite leagues beyond the sky

   The great Eternal reigns alone,

   Where neither wings nor souls can fly,

   Nor angels climb the topless throne.


   The Lord of glory builds his seat

   Of gems insufferably bright,

   And lays beneath his sacred feet

   Substantial beams of gloomy night.


   Yet, glorious Lord, thy gracious eyes

   Look through and cheer us from above

   Beyond our praise thy grandeur flies,

   Yet we adore, and yet we love.

   Praise ye him, all his angels. Psa. 148:2.


   God! the eternal, awful name

   That the whole heav'nly army fears,

   That shakes the wide creation's frame,

   And Satan trembles when he hears.


   Like flames of fire his servants are,

   And light surrounds his dwelling-place;

   But, O ye fiery flames! declare

   The brighter glories of his face.


   'Tis not for such poor worms as we

   To speak so infinite a thing;

   But your immortal eyes survey

   The beauties of your sovereign King.


   Tell how he shows his smiling face,

   And clothes all heav'n in bright array;

   Triumph and joy run through the place,

   And songs eternal as the day.


   Speak, for you feel his burning love,

   What zeal it spreads through all your frame;

   That sacred fire dwells all above,

   For we on earth have lost the name.


   [Sing of his power and justice too,

   That infinite right hand of his

   That vanquished Satan and his crew,

   And thunder drove them down from bliss.]


   [What mighty storms of poisoned darts

   Were hurled upon the rebels there!

   What deadly jav'lins nailed their hearts

   Fast to the racks of long despair!]


   [Shout to your King, ye heav'nly host,

   You that beheld the sinking foe;

   Firmly ye stood when they were lost:

   Praise the rich grace that kept you so.]


   Proclaim his wonders from the skies,

   Let every distant nation hear;

   And while you sound his lofty praise,

   Let humble mortals bow and fear.

   Death and eternity.


   Stoop down, my thoughts, that use to rise,

   Converse awhile with death;

   Think how a gasping mortal lies,

   And pants away his breath.


   His quiv'ring lip hangs feebly down,

   His pulses faint and few;

   Then, speechless, with a doleful groan

   He bids the world adieu.


   But O! the soul that never dies!

   At once it leaves the clay!

   Ye thoughts, pursue it where it flies,

   And track its wondrous way.


   Up to the courts where angels dwell,

   It mounts triumphant there;

   Or devils plunge it down to hell,

   In infinite despair.


   And must my body faint and die?

   And must this soul remove?

   O for some guardian angel nigh,

   To bear it safe above!


   Jesus, to thy dear faithful hand

   My naked soul I trust,

   And my flesh waits for thy command

   To drop into my dust.

   Redemption by price and power.


   Jesus, with all thy saints above

   My tongue would bear her part,

   Would sound aloud thy saving love,.

   And sing thy bleeding heart.


   Blest be the Lamb, my dearest Lord,

   Who bought me with his blood,

   And quenched his Father's flaming sword

   In his own vital flood:


   The Lamb that freed my captive soul

   From Satan's heavy chains,

   And sent the lion down to howl

   Where hell and horror reigns.


   All glory to the dying Lamb,

   And never-ceasing praise,

   While angels live to know his name,

   Or saints to feel his grace.

   Heavenly joy on earth.


   Come, we that love the Lord,

   And let our joys be known;

   Join in a song with sweet accord,

   And thus surround the throne.


   [The sorrows of the mind

   Be banished from the place;

   Religion never was designed

   To make our pleasures less.]


   Let those refuse to sing

   That never knew our God;

   But favorites of the heav'nly King

   May speak their joys abroad.


   [The God that rules on high,

   And thunders when he please,

   That rides upon the stormy sky,

   And manages the seas;]


   This aweful God is ours,

   Our Father and our Love;

   He shall send down his heav'nly powers

   To carry us above.


   There we shall see his face,

   And never, never sin;

   There, from the rivers of his grace,

   Drink endless pleasures in.


   Yes, and before we rise

   To that immortal state,

   The thoughts of such amazing bliss

   Should constant joys create.


   [The men of grace have found

   Glory begun below;

   Celestial fruits on earthly ground

   From faith and hope may grow.]


   The hill of Zion yields

   A thousand sacred sweets,

   Before we reach the heav'nly fields,

   Or walk the golden streets.


   Then let our songs abound,

   And every tear be dry;

   We're marching through Immanuel's ground

   To fairer worlds on high.

   Christ's presence makes death easy.


   Why should we start, and fear to die

   What timorous worms we mortals are!

   Death is the gate of endless joy,

   And yet we dread to enter there.


   The pains, the groans, and dying strife,

   Fright our approaching souls away;

   Still we shrink back again to life,

   Fond of our prison and our clay.


   O! if my Lord would come and meet,

   My soul should stretch her wings in haste,

   Fly fearless through death's iron gate,

   Nor feel the terrors as she passed.


   Jesus can make a dying bed

   Feel soft as downy pillows are,

   While on his breast I lean my head,

   And breathe my life out sweetly there.

   Frailty and folly.


   How short and hasty is our life!

   How vast our souls' affairs!

   Yet senseless mortals vainly strive

   To lavish out their years.


   Our days run thoughtlessly along,

   Without a moment's stay;

   Just like a story or a song

   We pass our lives away.


   God from on high invites us home,

   But we march heedless on,

   And ever hast'ning to the tomb,

   Stoop downwards as we run.


   How we deserve the deepest hell,

   That slight the joys above!

   What chains of vengeance should we feel,

   That break such cords of love!


   Draw us, O God, with sovereign grace,

   And lift our thoughts on high,

   That we may end this mortal race,

   And see salvation nigh.

   That's worthy of thy feet.


   [Thus will we mount on sacred wings,

   And tread the courts above;

   Nor earth, nor all her mightiest things,

   Shall tempt our meanest love.]


   There on a high majestic throne

   Th' Almighty Father reigns,

   And sheds his glorious goodness down

   On all the blissful plains.


   Bright like a sun the Savior sits,

   And spreads eternal noon;

   No evenings there, nor gloomy nights,

   To want the feeble moon.


   Amidst those ever-shining skies,

   Behold the sacred Dove!

   While banished sin and sorrow flies

   From all the realms of love.


   The glorious tenants of the place

   Stand bending round the throne;

   And saints and seraphs sing and praise

   The infinite Three One.


   [But O! what beams of heav'nly grace

   Transport them all the while

   Ten thousand smiles from Jesus' face,

   And love in every smile!]

   In these cold hearts of ours.


   Look how we grovel here below,

   Fond of these trifling toys;

   Our souls can neither fly nor go

   To reach eternal joys.


   In vain we tune our formal songs,

   In vain we strive to rise;

   Hosannahs languish on our tongues,

   And our devotion dies.


   Dear Lord! and shall we ever lie

   At this poor dying rate?

   Our love so faint, so cold to thee,

   And thine to us so great?

   Knowledge, alas! 'tis all in vain,

   And all in vain our fear;

   Our stubborn sins will fight and reign,

   If love be absent there.


   'Tis love that makes our cheerful feet

   In swift obedience move;

   But Satan cannot love.


   This is the grace that lives and sings

   When faith and hope shall cease;

   'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings

   What little things these worlds would be!

   Above at thy right hand

   Thy courts below, how amiable!

   Where all thy graces stand!


   The swallow near thy temple lies,

   And chirps a cheerful note;

   The lark mounts upward to the skies,

   And tunes her warbling throat:


   And we, when in thy presence, Lord,

   We shout with joyful tongues;

   Or sitting round our Father's board,

   We crown the feast with songs.


   While Jesus shines with quick'ning grace,

   We sing, and mount on high;

   But if a frown becloud his face,

   We faint, and tire, and die.


   [Just as we see the lonesome dove

   Bemoan her widowed state,

   Wand'ring she flies through all the grove,

   And mourns her loving mate;


   Just so our thoughts from thing to thing

   In restless circles rove;

   Just so we droop and hang the wing,

   When Jesus hides his love.]

  HYMN 43

   L. M.

   Christ's sufferings and glory.


   Now for a tune of lofty praise

   To great Jehovah's equal Son!

   Awake, my voice, in heav'nly lays

   Tell the loud wonders he hath done.


   Sing how he left the worlds of light,

   And the bright robes he wore above;

   How swift and joyful was his flight,

   On wings of everlasting love!


   [Down to this base, this sinful earth,

   He came to raise our nature high;

   He came t' atone Almighty wrath;

   Jesus, the God, was born to die.]


   [Hell and its lions roared around,

   His precious blood the monsters spilt;

   While weighty sorrows pressed him down,

   Large as the loads of all our guilt.]


   Deep in the shades of gloomy death

   Th' almighty Captive pris'ner lay,

   Th' almighty Captive left the earth,

   And rose to everlasting day.


   Lift up your eyes, ye sons of light,

   Up to his throne of shining grace;

   See what immortal glories sit

   Round the sweet beauties of his face!


   Amongst a thousand harps and songs,

   Jesus, the God, exalted reigns;

   His sacred name fills all their tongues,

   And echoes through the heav'nly plains.

   L. M.

   Hell; or, The vengeance of God.


   With holy fear and humble song,

   The dreadful God our souls adore;

   Rev'rence and awe become the tongue

   That speaks the terrors of his power.


   Far in the deep where darkness dwells,

   The land of horror and despair,

   Justice has built a dismal hell,

   And laid her stores of vengeance there.


   [Eternal plagues, and heavy chains,

   Tormenting racks, and fiery coals,

   And darts t' inflict immortal pains,

   Dyed in the blood of damned souls.]


   [There Satan, the first sinner, lies,

   And roars, and bites his iron bands;

   In vain the rebel strives to rise,

   Crushed with the weight of both thy hands.]


   There guilty ghosts of Adam's race

   Shriek out, and howl beneath thy rod

   Once they could scorn a Savior's grace,

   But they incensed a dreadful God.


   Tremble, my soul, and kiss the Son;

   Sinners, obey the Savior's call;

   Else your damnation hastens on,

   And hell gapes wide to wait your fall.

   God's condescension to our worship.


   Thy favors, Lord, surprise our souls;

   Will the Eternal dwell with us?

   What canst thou find beneath the poles

   To tempt thy chariot downward thus?


   Still might he fill his starry throne,

   And please his ears with Gabriel's songs;

   But th' heav'nly Majesty comes down,

   And bows to hearken to our tongues.


   Great God! what poor returns we pay

   For love so infinite as thine!

   Words are but air, and tongues but clay;

   But thy compassion's all divine.

   L. M.

   God's condescension to human affairs.


   Up to the Lord, that reigns on high,

   And views the nations from afar,

   Let everlasting praises fly,

   And tell how large his bounties are.


   [He that can shake the worlds he made,

   Or with his word, or with his rod,

   His goodness, how amazing great!

   And what a condescending God!]


   [God, that must stoop to view the skies,

   And bow to see what angels do,

   Down to our earth he casts his eyes,

   And bends his footsteps downwards too.]


   He overrules all mortal things,

   And manages our mean affairs;

   On humble souls the King of kings

   Bestows his counsels and his cares.


   Our sorrows and our tears we pour

   Into the bosom of our God;

   He hears us in the mournful hour,

   And helps us bear the heavy load.


   In vain might lofty princes try

   Such condescension to perform;

   For worms were never raised so high

   Above their meanest fellow worm.


   O could our thankful hearts devise

   A tribute equal to thy grace,

   To the third heav'n our songs should rise,

   And teach the golden harps thy praise.

   Glory and grace in the person of Christ.


   Now to the Lord a noble song!

   Awake, my soul; awake, my tongue;

   Hosannah to th' Eternal Name,

   And all his boundless love proclaim.


   See where it shines in Jesus' face,

   The brightest image of his grace;

   God, in the person of his Son,

   Has all his mightiest works outdone.


   The spacious earth and spreading flood

   Proclaim the wise and powerful God;

   And thy rich glories from afar

   Sparkle in every rolling star.


   But in his looks a glory stands,

   The noblest labor of thine hands;

   The pleasing lustre of his eyes

   Outshines the wonders of the skies.


   Grace! 'tis a sweet, a charming theme;

   My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name:

   Ye angels, dwell upon the sound!

   Ye heav'ns, reflect it to the ground!


   O may I live to reach the place

   Where he unveils his lovely face!

   Where all his beauties you behold,

   And sing his name to harps of gold!

   Love to the creatures is dangerous.


   How vain are all things here below!

   How false, and yet how fair!

   Each pleasure hath its poison too,

   And every sweet a snare.


   The brightest things below the sky

   Give but a flatt'ring light;

   We should suspect some danger nigh

   Where we possess delight.


   Our dearest joys, and nearest friends,

   The partners of our blood,

   How they divide our wav'ring minds,

   And leave but half for God!


   The fondness of a creature's love,

   How strong it strikes the sense!

   Thither the warm affections move,

   Nor can we call them thence.


   Dear Savior! let thy beauties be

   My soul's eternal food;

   And grace command my heart away

   From all created good.

   C. M.

   Moses dying in the embraces of God.


   Death cannot make our souls afraid,

   If God be with us there;

   We may walk through its darkest shade,

   And never yield to fear.


   I could renounce my all below,

   If my Creator bid;

   And run, if I were called to go,

   And die as Moses did.


   Might I but climb to Pisgah's top,

   And view the promised land,

   My flesh itself should long to drop,

   And pray for the command.


   Clasped in my heav'nly Father's arms,

   I would forget my breath,

   And lose my life among the charms

   Of so divine a death.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 50

   L. M.

   Comfort under sorrows and pains.


   Now let the Lord my Savior smile,

   And show my name upon his heart,

   I would forget my pains awhile,

   And in the pleasure lose the smart.


   But O, it swells my sorrows high

   To see my blessed Jesus frown;

   My spirits sink, my comforts die,

   And all the springs of life are down.


   Yet why, my soul, why these complaints?

   Still while he frowns his bowels move;

   Still on his heart he bears his saints,

   And feels their sorrows and his love.


   My name is printed on his breast;

   His book of life contains my name;

   I'd rather have it there impressed

   Than in the bright records of fame.


   When the last fire burns all things here,

   Those letters shall securely stand,

   And in the Lamb's fair book appear,

   Writ by th' eternal Father's hand.


   Now shall my minutes smoothly run,

   Whilst here I wait my Father's will;

   My rising and my setting sun

   Roll gently up and down the hill.

   God the Son equal with the Father.


   Bright King of glory, dreadful God!

   Our spirits bow before thy seat,

   To thee we lift an humble thought,

   And worship at thine awful feet.


   [Thy power hath formed, thy wisdom sways,

   All nature with a sovereign word;

   And the bright world of stars obeys

   The will of their superior Lord.]


   [Mercy and truth unite in one,

   And smiling sit at thy right hand;

   Eternal justice guards thy throne,

   And vengeance waits thy dread command.]


   A thousand seraphs, strong and bright,

   Stand round the glorious Deity;

   But who amongst the sons of light

   Pretends comparison with thee?


   Yet there is one of human frame,

   Jesus, arrayed in flesh and blood,

   Thinks it no robbery to claim

   A full equality with God.


   Their glory shines with equal beams,

   Their essence is for ever one,

   Though they are known by diff'rent names,

   The Father God, and God the Son.


   Then let the name of Christ our King

   With equal honors be adored;

   His praise let every angel sing,

   And all the nations own their Lord.

   Death dreadful or delightful.


   Death! 'Tis a melancholy day

   To those that have no God,

   When the poor soul is forced away

   To seek her last abode.


   In vain to heav'n she lifts her eyes,

   But guilt, a heavy chain,

   Still drags her downward from the skies

   To darkness, fire, and pain.


   Awake and mourn, ye heirs of hell,

   Let stubborn sinners fear,

   You must be driv'n from earth, and dwell

   A long forever there.


   See how the pit gapes wide for you,

   And flashes in your face:

   And thou, my soul, look downwards too,

   And sing recov'ring grace.


   He is a God of sovereign love

   That promised heav'n to me,

   And taught my thoughts to soar above,

   Where happy spirits be.


   Prepare me, Lord, for thy right hand,

   Then come the joyful day,

   Come, death, and some celestial band,

   To bear my soul away.

   The pilgrimage of the saints: or, Earth and heaven.


   Lord! what a wretched land is this,

   That yields us no supply!

   No cheering fruits, no wholesome trees,

   Nor streams of living joy!


   But pricking thorns through all the ground,

   And mortal poisons grow,

   And all the rivers that are found

   With dangerous waters flow.


   Yet the dear path to thine abode

   Lies through this horrid land;

   Lord! we would keep the heav'nly road,

   And run at thy command.


   [Our souls shall tread the desert through

   With undiverted feet,

   And faith and flaming zeal subdue

   The terrors that we meet.]


   [A thousand savage beasts of prey

   Around the forest roam;

   But Judah's Lion guards the way,

   And guides the strangers home.]


   [Long nights and darkness dwell below,

   With scarce a twinkling ray;

   But the bright world to which we go

   Is everlasting day.]


   [By glimm'ring hopes and gloomy fears

   We trace the sacred road;

   Through dismal deeps and dangerous snares

   We make our way to God.]


   Our journey is a thorny maze,

   But we march upward still;

   Forget these troubles of the ways,

   And reach at Zion's hill.


   [See the kind angels at the gates,

   Inviting us to come!

   There Jesus the forerunner waits,

   To welcome trav'llers home!]


   There on a green and flowery mount

   Our weary souls shall sit,

   And with transporting joys recount

   The labors of our feet.


   [No vain discourse shall fill our tongue,

   Nor trifles vex our ear;

   Infinite grace shall be our song,

   And God rejoice to hear.]


   Eternal glories to the King

   That brought us safely through;

   Our tongues shall never cease to sing,

   And endless praise renew.

   My God, the spring of all my joys,

   The life of my delights,

   And comfort of my nights.


   In darkest shades if he appear

   My dawning is begun;

   He is my soul's sweet morning star,

   And he my rising sun.


   The opening heav'ns around me shine

   With beams of sacred bliss,

   While Jesus shows his heart is mine,

   And whispers, I am his.


   My soul would leave this heavy clay

   At that transporting word,

   Run up with joy the shining way

   T' embrace my dearest Lord.


   Fearless of hell and ghastly death,

   I'd break through every foe;

   The wings of love and arms of faith

   Should bear me conqueror through.

   Frail life, and succeeding eternity.


   Thee we adore, Eternal Name,

   And humbly own to thee

   How feeble is our mortal frame!

   What dying worms are we!


   [Our wasting lives grow shorter still

   As months and days increase;

   And every beating pulse we tell

   Leaves but the number less.


   The year rolls round, and steals away

   The breath that first it gave;

   Whate'er we do, where'er we be,

   We're trav'lling to the grave.]


   Dangers stand thick through all the ground

   To push us to the tomb,

   And fierce diseases wait around,

   To hurry mortals home.


   Great God! on what a slender thread

   Hang everlasting things!

   Th' eternal states of all the dead

   Upon life's feeble strings.


   Infinite joy or endless woe

   Attends on every breath,

   And yet how unconcerned we go

   Upon the brink of death!


   Waken, O Lord! our drowsy sense,

   To walk this dangerous road;

   And if our souls be hurried hence,

   May they be found with God.

   The misery of being without God in this world; or, Vain prosperity.


   No, I shall envy them no more

   Who grow profanely great,

   Though they increase their golden store,

   And rise to wondrous height.


   They taste of all the joys that grow

   Upon this earthly clod!

   Well, they may search the creature through,

   For they have ne'er a God.


   Shake off the thoughts of dying too,

   And think your life your own;

   But death comes hast'ning on to you,

   To mow your glory down.


   Yes, you must bow your stately head,

   Away your spirit flies,

   And no kind angel near your bed,

   To bear it to the skies.


   Go now, and boast of all your stores,

   And tell how bright you shine;

   Your heaps of glitt'ring dust are yours,

   And my Redeemer's mine.

   The pleasures of a good conscience.


   Lord, how secure and blest are they

   Who feel the joys of pardoned sin!

   Should storms of wrath shake earth and sea,

   Their minds have heav'n and peace within.


   The day glides sweetly o'er their heads,

   Made up of innocence and love;

   And soft and silent as the shades

   Their nightly minutes gently move.


   [Quick as their thoughts their joys come on,

   But fly not half so swift away;

   Their souls are ever bright as noon,

   And calm as summer evenings be.


   How oft they look to th' heav'nly hills,

   Where groves of living pleasure grow!

   And longing hopes and cheerful smiles

   Sit undisturbed upon their brow.]


   They scorn to seek our golden toys,

   But spend the day and share the night

   In numb'ring o'er the richer joys

   That heav'n prepares for their delight.


   While wretched we, like worms and moles,

   Swift as an Indian arrow flies,

   Or like a shooting star.


   [The present moments just appear,

   Then slide away in haste,

   That we can never say, "They're here,"

   But only say, "They're past."]


   [Our life is ever on the wing,

   And death is ever nigh;

   The moment when our lives begin

   We all begin to die.]


   Yet, mighty God! our fleeting days

   Thy lasting favors share,

   Yet with the bounties of thy grace

   Thou load'st the rolling year.


   'Tis sovereign mercy finds us food,

   And we are clothed with love;

   While grace stands pointing out the road

   That leads our souls above.


   His goodness runs an endless round;

   All glory to the Lord!

   His mercy never knows a bound,

   And be his name adored!


   Thus we begin the lasting song;

   Paradise on earth.


   Glory to God that walks the sky,

   And sends his blessings through;

   That tells his saints of joys on high,

   And gives a taste below.


   [Glory to God that stoops his throne

   That dust and worms may see

   And brings a glimpse of glory down

   Around his sacred feet.


   When Christ, with all his graces crowned,

   Sheds his kind beams abroad,

   'Tis a young heav'n on earthly ground,

   And glory in the bud.


   A blooming paradise of joy

   In this wild desert springs;

   And every sense I straight employ

   On sweet celestial things.


   White lilies all around appear,

   And each his glory shows:

   The Rose of Sharon blossoms here,

   The fairest flower that blows.


   Cheerful I feast on heav'nly fruit,

   And drink the pleasures down;

   Pleasures that flow hard by the foot

   Of the eternal throne.]


   But ah! how soon my joys decay!

   How soon my sins arise,

   And snatch the heav'nly scene away

   From these lamenting eyes!


   When shall the time, dear Jesus, when

   The shining day appear,

   That I shall leave those clouds of sin,

   And guilt and darkness here?


   Up to the fields above the skies

   My hasty feet would go,

   There everlasting flowers arise,

   And joys unwith'ring grow.

   Praise to the goodness of the Lord,

   Who rules his people by his word,

   And there, as strong as his decrees,

   He sets his kindest promises.


   [Firm are the words his prophets give,

   Sweet words on which his children live;

   Each of them is the voice of God,

   Who spoke, and spread the skies abroad.


   Each of them powerful as that sound

   That bid the new-made world go round;

   And stronger than the solid poles

   On which the wheel of nature rolls.]


   Whence then should doubts and fears arise?

   Why trickling sorrows drown our eyes?

   Slowly, alas! our mind receives

   The comfort that our Maker gives.


   O for a strong, a lasting faith,

   To credit what th' Almighty saith!

   T' embrace the message of his Son,

   And call the joys of heav'n our own.


   Then should the earth's old pillars shake,

   And all the wheels of nature break,

   Our steady souls should fear no more

   O could we die with those that die,

   And place us in their stead,

   Then would our spirits learn to fly,

   And converse with the dead:


   Then should we see the saints above

   In their own glorious forms,

   And wonder why our souls should love

   To dwell with mortal worms.


   [How we should scorn these clothes of flesh,

   These fetters, and this load!

   And long for ev'ning to undress,

   That we may rest with God.]

   When this incensed God

   Shall rend the sky, and burn the sea,

   And fling his wrath abroad.


   What shall the wretch the sinner do?

   He once defied the Lord;

   But he shall dread the Thund'rer now,

   Then let our souls in Zion dwell,

   Nor fear the wrath of Rome and hell;

   What worthless worms are we!

   Let the whole race of creatures bow,

  HYMN 68

   C. M.

   The humble worship of heaven.


   Father, I long, I faint to see

   The place of thine abode;

   I'd leave thine earthly courts, and flee

   Up to thy seat, my God!


   Here I behold thy distant face,

   And 'tis a pleasing sight;

   But to abide in thine embrace

   Is infinite delight.


   I'd part with all the joys of sense

   To gaze upon thy throne;

   Pleasure springs fresh for ever thence,

   Unspeakable, unknown.


   [There all the heav'nly hosts are seen,

   In shining ranks they move,

   And drink immortal vigor in

   With wonder and with love.


   Then at thy feet with awful fear

   Th' adoring armies fall;

   With joy they shrink to nothing there,

   Before th' eternal All.


   There I would vie with all the host

   In duty and in bliss;

   While "less than nothing" I could boast,

   And "vanity confess."]


   The more thy glories strike mine eyes

   The humbler I shall lie;

   Thus while I sink, my joys shall rise

   Unmeasurably high.

   C. M.

   The faithfulness of God in the promises.


   [Begin, my tongue, some heav'nly theme,

   And speak some boundless thing;

   The mighty works, or mightier name,

   Of our eternal King.


   Tell of his wondrous faithfulness,

   And sound his power abroad;

   Sing the sweet promise of his grace,

   And the performing God.


   Proclaim "salvation from the Lord

   For wretched, dying men;"

   His hand has writ the sacred word

   With an immortal pen.


   Engraved as in eternal brass

   The mighty promise shines;

   Nor can the powers of darkness 'rase

   Those everlasting lines.]


   [He that can dash whole worlds to death,

   And make them when he please,

   He speaks, and that almighty breath

   Fulfils his great decrees.


   His very word of grace is strong

   As that which built the skies,

   The voice that rolls the stars along

   Speaks all the promises.


   He said, "Let the wide heav'n be spread,"

   And heav'n was stretched abroad:

   "Abram, I'll be thy God," he said,

   And he was Abram's God.


   O might I hear thine heav'nly tongue

   But whisper, "Thou art mine!"

   Those gentle words should raise my song

   To notes almost divine.


   How would my leaping heart rejoice,

   And think my heav'n secure!

   I trust the all-creating voice,

   And faith desires no more.]

   God's dominion over the sea. Psa. 107:23ff


   God of the seas! thy thund'ring voice

   Makes all the roaring waves rejoice,

   And one soft word of thy command

   Can sink them silent in the sand.


   If but a Moses wave thy rod,

   The sea divides and owns its God;

   The stormy floods their Maker knew,

   And let his chosen armies through.


   The scaly flocks amidst the sea,

   To thee, their Lord, a tribute pay;

   The meanest fish that swims the flood

   Leaps up, and means a praise to God.


   [The larger monsters of the deep

   On thy commands attendance keep;

   By thy permission sport and play,

   And cleave along their foaming way.


   If God his voice of tempest rears,

   Leviathan lies still and fears;

   Anon he lifts his nostrils high,

   And spouts the ocean to the sky.]


   How is thy glorious power adored

   Amidst these wat'ry nations, Lord!

   Yet the bold men that trace the seas,

   Bold men, refuse their Maker's praise!


   [What scenes of miracles they see,

   And never tune a song to thee!

   While on the flood they safely ride,

   They curse the hand that smooths the tide!


   Anon they plunge in wat'ry graves,

   And some drink death among the waves;

   Yet the surviving crew blaspheme,

   Nor own the God that rescued them.]


   O for some signal of thine hand!

   Shake all the seas, Lord, shake the land;

   Great Judge! descend, lest men deny

   That there's a God that rules the sky.

   The glories of my Maker God

   Their Former and their King.


   'Twas his right hand that shaped our clay,

   And wrought this human frame;

   But from his own immediate breath

   Our nobler spirits came.


   We bring our mortal powers to God,

   And worship with our tongues;

   We claim some kindred with the skies,

   And join th' angelic songs.


   Let grov'lling beasts of every shape,

   And fowls of every wing,

   And rocks, and trees, and fires, and seas,

   Their various tribute bring.


   Ye planets, to his honor shine,

   And wheels of nature roll,

   Praise him in your unwearied course

   Around the steady pole.

   The wide creation fills,

   And his unbounded grandeur flies

   Beyond the heav'nly hills.

   The Lord's day; or, The resurrection of Christ.


   Blest morning, whose young dawning rays

   Beheld our rising God,

   That saw him triumph o'er the dust,

   And leave his dark abode!


   In the cold prison of a tomb

   The dead Redeemer lay,

   Till the revolving skies had brought

   The third, th' appointed day.


   Hell and the grave unite their force

   To hold our God in vain;

   The sleeping Conqueror arose,

   And burst their feeble chain.


   To thy great name, almighty Lord,

   These sacred hours we pay;

   And loud hosannahs shall proclaim

   The triumph of the day.


   [Salvation and immortal praise

   And make a joyful noise.


   Darkness and doubts had veiled my mind,

   And drowned my head in tears,

   Till sovereign grace with shining rays

   Dispelled my gloomy fears.


   O what immortal joys I felt,

   And raptures all divine,

   When Jesus told me I was his,

   And my Beloved mine!


   In vain the tempter frights my soul,

   Repentance from a sense of Divine goodness.


   Is this the kind return,

   Thus to abuse eternal love,

   Whence all our blessings flow?


   To what a stubborn frame

   Has sin reduced our mind!

   What strange rebellious wretches we,

   And God as strangely kind!


   [On us he bids the sun

   Shed his reviving rays;

   For us the skies their circles run,

   To lengthen out our days.


   The brutes obey their God,

   And bow their necks to men;

   But we, more base, more brutish things,

   Reject his easy reign.]


   Turn, turn us, mighty God,

   And mold our souls afresh;

   Break, sovereign grace, these hearts of stone,

   And give us hearts of flesh.

   Death is no more the king of dread,

   Since our Immanuel rose;

   With scars of honor in his flesh

   And triumph in his eyes.


   There our exalted Savior reigns,

   To fiery deeps and endless night.


   What though thine inward lusts rebel,

   'Tis but a struggling gasp for life;

   Redemption by Christ.


   When the first parents of our race

   Rebelled and lost their God,

   And the infection of their sin

   Had tainted all our blood;


   Infinite pity touched the heart

   Of the eternal Son;

   Descending from the heav'nly court,

   He left his Father's throne.


   Aside the Prince of glory threw

   His most divine array,

   And wrapped his godhead in a veil

   Of our inferior clay.


   His living power and dying love

   Redeemed unhappy men,

   And raised the ruins of our race

   To life and God again.


   To thee, dear Lord, our flesh and soul

   We joyfully resign;

   Bless'd Jesus, take us for thy own,

   For we are doubly thine.


   Thine honor shall for ever be

   The business of our days;

   For ever shall our thankful tongues

   Speak thy deserved praise.

   Plunged in a gulf of dark despair

   We wretched sinners lay,

   Without one cheerful beam of hope,

   Or spark of glimm'ring day.


   With pitying eyes the Prince of grace

   Beheld our helpless grief;

   He saw, and, O amazing love!

   He ran to our relief.


   Down from the shining seats above

   With joyful haste he fled,

   Entered the grave in mortal flesh,

   And dwelt among the dead.


   He spoiled the powers of darkness thus,

   And brake our iron chains;

   Jesus hath freed our captive souls

   From everlasting pains.


   [In vain the baffled prince of hell

   His cursed projects tries

   We that were doomed his endless slaves

   Are raised above the skies.]


   O for this love let rocks and hills

   Their lasting silence break,

   And all harmonious human tongues

   The Savior's praises speak.


   [Yes, we will praise thee, dearest Lord,

   Our souls are all on flame;

   Hosannah round the spacious earth

   To thine adored name.

   That thy fair body tore?

   Was it for crimes that I had done

   My dearest Lord was slain,

   When justice seized God's only Son,

   He dies to save our guilty race,

   And yet he rises too.


   A person so divine was he

   Who yielded to be slain,

   That he could give his soul away,

   Went deep into his side,

   And the rich flood of purple gore

   Their murd'rous weapons dyed.]


   [The waves of swelling grief

   Did o'er his bosom roll,

   And mountains of Almighty wrath

   Lay heavy on his soul.]


   Down to the shades of death

   He bowed his awful head;

   Yet he arose to live and reign

   When death itself is dead.


   No more the bloody spear,

   The cross and nails no more

   And all the heav'ns adore.

   It rises high, and drowns the hills,

   Has neither shore nor bound:

   Now, if we search to find our sins,

   Our sins can ne'er be found.

   Can one delight afford,

   No, not a drop of real joy,

   Without thy presence, Lord.


   Thou art the sea of love

   Where all my pleasures roll,

   The circle where my passions move,

   And center of my soul.


   [To thee my spirits fly

   With infinite desire;

   And yet how far from thee I lie!

   Dear Jesus, raise me higher.]

   God my only happiness. Psa. 73:25


   My God, my portion, and my love,

   My everlasting all!

   I've none but thee in heav'n above,

   Or on this earthly ball.


   [What empty things are all the skies,

   And this inferior clod!

   There's nothing here deserves my joys,

   There's nothing like my God.]


   [In vain the bright, the burning sun

   Scatters his feeble light;

   'Tis thy sweet beams create my noon;

   If thou withdraw, 'tis night.


   And whilst upon my restless bed,

   Amongst the shades I roll,

   If my Redeemer shows his head,

   'Tis morning with my soul.]


   To thee we owe our wealth, and friends,

   And health, and safe abode:

   Thanks to thy name for meaner things,

   But they are not my God.


   How vain a toy is glitt'ring wealth,

   If once compared to thee!

   Or what's my safety, or my health,

   Or all my friends to me?


   Were I possessor of the earth,

   And called the stars my own,

   Without thy graces and thyself

   I were a wretch undone.


   Let others stretch their arms like seas

   And grasp in all the shore,

   Grant me the visits of thy face,

   And I desire no more.

   Look on him whom they pierced, and mourn.


   Infinite grief! amazing woe!

   Behold my bleeding Lord!

   Hell and the Jews conspired his death,

   And used the Roman sword.


   O, the sharp pangs of smarting pain

   My dear Redeemer bore,

   When knotty whips and ragged thorns

   His sacred body tore!


   But knotty whips and ragged thorns

   In vain do I accuse;

   In vain I blame the Roman bands,

   And the more spiteful Jews.


   'Twere you, my sins, my cruel sins,

   His chief tormentors were;

   Each of my crimes became a nail,

   And unbelief the spear.


   'Twere you that pulled the vengeance down

   Upon his guiltless head:

   Break, break, my heart! O burst, mine eyes!

   And let my sorrows bleed.


   Strike, mighty grace, my flinty soul,

   Till melting waters flow,

   And deep repentance drown mine eyes

   In undissembled woe.

   Distinguishing love; or, Angels punished and man saved.


   Down headlong from their native skies

   The rebel angels fell,

   And thunderbolts of flaming wrath

   Pursued them deep to hell.


   Down from the top of earthly bliss

   Rebellious man was hurled,

   And Jesus stooped beneath the grave

   To reach a sinking world.


   O love of infinite degree!

   Unmeasurable grace!

   Must heav'n's eternal darling die,

   To save a trait'rous race?


   Must angels sink for ever down,

   And burn in quenchless fire,

   While God forsakes his shining throne

   To raise us wretches higher?


   O for this love let earth and skies

   With hallelujahs ring,

   And the full choir of human tongues

   All hallelujahs sing.

   And mercy lifts him to a crown.


   Amazing work of sovereign grace

   That could distinguish rebels so!

   Our guilty treasons called aloud

   For everlasting fetters too.

   Hardness of heart complained of.


   My heart, how dreadful hard it is!

   How heavy here it lies!

   Heavy and cold within my breast,

   Just like a rock of ice!


   Sin, like a raging tyrant, sits

   Upon this flinty throne,

   And every grace lies buried deep

   Beneath this heart of stone.


   How seldom do I rise to God,

   Or taste the joys above!

   This mountain presses down my faith,

   And chills my flaming love.


   When smiling mercy courts my Soul

   With all its heav'nly charms,

   This stubborn, this relentless thing

   Would thrust it from my arms.


   Against the thunders of thy word

   Rebellious I have stood;

   My heart, it shakes not at the wrath

   And terrors of a God.


   Dear Savior, steep this rock of mine

   In thine own crimson sea!

   None but a bath of blood divine

   Can melt the flint away.

   He governs with a nod.


   [Ten thousand ages ere the skies

   Were into motion brought,

   All the long years and worlds to come

   Stood present to his thought.


   There's not a sparrow or a worm

   But's found in his decrees;

   He raises monarchs to their throne,

   And sinks them as he please.]


   If light attends the course I run,

   'Tis he provides those rays;

   And 'tis his hand that hides my sun,

   If darkness clouds my days.


   Yet I would not be much concerned,

   Nor vainly long to see

   The volume of his deep decrees,

   What months are writ for me.


   When he reveals the book of life,

   O may I read my name

   Amongst the chosen of his love,

   The followers of the Lamb!

   The presence of Christ is the life of my soul.


   [How full of anguish is the thought,

   How it distracts and tears my heart,

   If God, at last, my sovereign Judge,

   Should frown, and bid my soul "Depart!"]


   Lord, when I quit this earthly stage,

   Where shall I fly but to thy breast?

   For I have sought no other home;

   For I have learned no other rest.


   I cannot live contented here

   Without some glimpses of thy face;

   And heav'n, without thy presence there,

   Would be a dark and tiresome place.


   When earthly cares engross the day,

   And hold my thoughts aside from thee,

   The shining hours of cheerful light

   Are long and tedious years to me.


   And if no evening visit's paid

   Between my Savior and my soul,

   How dull the night! how sad the shade!

   How mournfully the minutes roll!


   This flesh of mine might learn as soon

   To live, yet part with all my blood;

   To breathe when vital air is gone,

   Or thrive and grow without my food.


   [Christ is my light, my life, my care,

   My blessed hope, my heav'nly prize;

   Dearer than all my passions are,

   My limbs, my bowels, or my eyes.]


   [The strings that twine about my heart,

   Tortures and racks may tear them off

   But they can never, never part

   With their dear hold of Christ my love.]


   [My God! and can an humble child,

   That loves thee with a flame so high,

   Be ever from thy face exiled,

   Without the pity of thine eye?


   Impossible!-for thine own hands

   Have tied my heart so fast to thee;

   And in thy book the promise stands,

   That where thou art thy friends must be.]

   The world's three chief temptations.


   When in the light of faith divine

   We look on things below,

   Honor, and gold, and sensual joy,

   How vain and dangerous too!


   [Honor's a puff of noisy breath;

   Yet men expose their blood,

   And venture everlasting death,

   To gain that airy good.


   Whilst others starve the nobler mind,

   And feed on shining dust,

   They rob the serpent of his food

   T' indulge a sordid lust.]


   The pleasures that allure our sense

   Are dangerous snares to souls;

   There's but a drop of flatt'ring sweet,

   And dashed with bitter bowls.


   God is mine all-sufficient good,

   My portion and my choice;

   In him my vast desires are filled,

   And all my powers rejoice.


   In vain the world accosts my ear,

   And tempts my heart anew;

   I cannot buy your bliss so dear,

   Nor part with heav'n for you.

   A happy resurrection.


   No, I'll repine at death no more,

   These dying, with'ring limbs of mine.


   Let worms devour my wasting flesh,

   And crumble all my bones to dust,

   My God shall raise my frame anew

   At the revival of the just.


   Break, sacred morning, through the skies,

   Bring that delightful, dreadful day;

   Cut short the hours, dear Lord, and come;

   Thy ling'ring wheels, how long they stay!


   [Our weary spirits faint to see

   The light of thy returning face,

   And hear the language of those lips,

   Where God has shed his richest grace.]

   Rouse all the pious sleeping clay,

   That we may join in heav'nly joys,

   And sing the triumph of the day.]

   Christ's commission. John 3:16,17


   Come, happy souls, approach your God

   With new melodious songs;

   Come, tender to almighty grace

   The tribute of your tongues.


   So strange, so boundless was the love

   That pitied dying men,

   The Father sent his equal Son

   To give them life again.


   Thy hands, dear Jesus, were not armed

   With a revenging rod,

   No hard commission to perform

   The vengeance of a God.


   But all was mercy, all was mild,

   And wrath forsook the throne,

   When Christ on the kind errand came,

   And brought salvation down.


   Here, sinners, you may heal your wounds,

   And wipe your sorrows dry;

   Trust in the mighty Savior's name,

   And you shall never die.


   See, dearest Lord, our willing souls

   Accept thine offered grace;

   We bless the great Redeemer's love,

   And give the Father praise.

   Reconciliation.


   Raise your triumphant songs

   To an immortal tune;

   Let the wide earth resound the deeds

   Celestial grace has done.


   Sing how eternal love

   Its chief Beloved chose,

   And bid him raise our wretched race

   From their abyss of woes.


   His hand no thunder bears,

   Nor terror clothes his brow;

   No bolts to drive our guilty souls

   To fiercer flames below.


   'Twas mercy filled the throne,

   And wrath stood silent by,

   When Christ was sent with pardons down

   To rebels doomed to die.


   Now, sinners, dry your tears,

   Let hopeless sorrow cease;

   Bow to the sceptre of his love,

   And take the offered peace.


   Lord, we obey thy call;

   We lay an humble claim

   To the salvation thou hast brought,

   And love and praise thy name.

   And are we wretches yet alive?

   And do we yet rebel?

   'Tis boundless, 'tis amazing love,

   That bears us up from hell!


   The burden of our weighty guilt

   Would sink us down to flames;

   And threat'ning vengeance rolls above,

   To crush our feeble frames.


   Almighty goodness cries, "Forbear!"

   And straight the thunder stays;

   And dare we now provoke his wrath,

   And weary out his grace?


   Lord, we have long abused thy love,

   Too long indulged our sin;

   Our aching hearts e'en bleed to see

   What rebels we have been.


   No more, ye lusts, shall ye command,

   No more will we obey;

   Stretch out, O God, thy conquering hand,

   And drive thy foes away.

   Repentance at the cross.


   O, if my soul were formed for woe,

   Repentance should like rivers flow

   From both my streaming eyes.


   'Twas for my sins my dearest Lord

   Hung on the cursed tree,

   And groaned away a dying life

   For thee, my soul, for thee.


   O, how I hate those lusts of mine

   That crucified my God!

   Those sins that pierced and nailed his flesh

   Fast to the fatal wood!


   Yes, my Redeemer, they shall die,

   My heart has so decreed;

   Nor will I spare the guilty things

   That made my Savior bleed.


   Whilst, with a melting, broken heart,

   My murdered Lord I view,

   I'll raise revenge against my sins,

   And slay the murd'rers too.

   Thou lovely chief of all my joys,

   Thou sovereign of my heart!

   How could I bear to hear thy voice

   Pronounce the sound, "Depart!"


   [The thunder of that dismal word

   Would so torment my ear,

   'Twould tear my soul asunder, Lord,

   With most tormenting fear.]


   [What! to be banished from my life,

   And yet forbid to die!

   To linger in eternal pain,

   Yet death for ever fly!]


   O, wretched state of deep despair!

   To see my God remove,

   And fix my doleful station where

   I must not taste his love.


   Jesus, I throw my arms around,

   And hang upon thy breast;

   Without a gracious smile from thee

   My spirit cannot rest.


   O, tell me that my worthless name

   Is graven on thy hands;

   Show me some promise in thy book

   Where my salvation stands!

   To sink my fears again,

   And cheerfully my soul shall wait

   Her threescore years and ten.]

   Access to the throne of grace by a mediator.


   Come, let us lift our joyful eyes

   Up to the courts above,

   And smile to see our Father there

   Upon a throne of love.


   Once 'twas a seat of dreadful wrath,

   And shot devouring flame

   Our God appeared "consuming fire,"

   And Vengeance was his name.


   Rich were the drops of Jesus' blood

   That calmed his frowning face,

   That sprinkled o'er the burning throne,

   And turned the wrath to grace.


   Now we may bow before his feet,

   And venture near the Lord;

   No fiery cherub guards his seat,

   Nor double-flaming sword.


   The peaceful gates of heav'nly bliss

   Are opened by the Son;

   High let us raise our notes of praise,

   And reach th' almighty throne.


   To thee ten thousand thanks we bring,

   Great Advocate on high;

   And glory to th' eternal King,

   That lays his fury by.

   The darkness of Providence.


   Lord, we adore thy vast designs,

   Th' obscure abyss of Providence,

   Too deep to sound with mortal lines,

   Too dark to view with feeble sense.


   Now thou array'st thine awful face

   In angry frowns, without a smile;

   We, through the cloud, believe thy grace,

   Secure of thy compassion still.


   Through seas and storms of deep distress

   We sail by faith, and not by sight;

   Faith guides us in the wilderness,

   Through all the briers and the night.


   Dear Father, if thy lifted rod

   Resolve to scourge us here below,

   Still we must lean upon our God,

   Thine arm shall bear us safely through.

   Corruption, earth, and worms

   Shall but refine this flesh,

   Till my triumphant spirit comes

   But 'tis the gospel must reveal

   Where lies our strength to do his will.


   The law discovers guilt and sin,

   And shows how vile our hearts have been;

   Only the gospel can express

   Forgiving love and cleansing grace.


   What curses doth the law denounce

   Against the man that fails but once!

   But in the gospel Christ appears

   Pard'ning the guilt of num'rous years.


   My soul, no more attempt to draw

   Thy life and comfort from the law;

   Fly to the hope the gospel gives;

   The man that trusts the promise lives.

   Retirement and meditation.


   My God, permit me not to be

   A stranger to myself and thee;

   Amidst a thousand thoughts I rove,

   Forgetful of my highest love.


   Why should my passions mix with earth,

   And thus debase my heav'nly birth?

   Why should I cleave to things below,

   And let my God, my Savior, go?


   Call me away from flesh and sense,

   One sovereign word can draw me thence;

   I would obey the voice divine,

   And all inferior joys resign.


   Be earth with all her scenes withdrawn,

   Let noise and vanity begone;

   In secret silence of the mind

   My heav'n, and there my God, I find.

  HYMN 123

   L. M.

   The benefit of public ordinances.


   Away from every mortal care,

   Away from earth, our souls retreat;

   We leave this worthless world afar,

   And wait and worship near thy seat.


   Lord, in the temple of thy grace

   We see thy feet, and we adore;

   We gaze upon thy lovely face,

   And learn the wonders of thy power.


   While here our various wants we mourn,

   United groans ascend on high;

   And prayer bears a quick return

   Of blessings in variety.


   [If Satan rage, and sin grow strong,

   Here we receive some cheering word;

   We gird the gospel armor on

   To fight the battles of the Lord.


   Or if our spirit faints and dies,

   (Our conscience galled with inward stings,)

   Here doth the righteous Sun arise

   With healing beams beneath his wings.]


   Father! my soul would still abide

   Within thy temple, near thy side;

   But if my feet must hence depart,

   Still keep thy dwelling in my heart.

  HYMN 124

   C. M.

   Moses, Aaron, and Joshua.

   *Joshua, the same with Jesus, and signifies a Savior.


   'Tis not the law of ten commands

   On holy Sinai giv'n,

   Or sent to men by Moses' hands,

   Can bring us safe to heav'n.


   'Tis not the blood which Aaron spilt,

   Nor smoke of sweetest smell,

   Can buy a pardon for our guilt,

   Or save our souls from hell.


   Aaron the priest resigns his breath

   At God's immediate will;

   And in the desert yields to death,

   Upon th' appointed hill.


   And thus on Jordan's yonder side

   The tribes of Isr'el stand,

   While Moses bowed his head and died

   Short of the promised land.


   Isr'el, rejoice, now Joshua* leads,

   He'll bring your tribes to rest;

   So far the Savior's name exceeds

   The ruler and the priest.

   Faith and repentance, unbelief and impenitence.


   Life and immortal joys are giv'n

   To souls that mourn the sins they've done;

   Children of wrath made heirs of heav'n

   By faith in God's eternal Son.


   Woe to the wretch that never felt

   The inward pangs of pious grief,

   But adds to all his crying guilt

   The stubborn sin of unbelief!


   The law condemns the rebel dead,

   Under the wrath of God he lies;

   He seals the curse on his own head,

   And with a double vengeance dies.

   God glorified in the gospel.


   The Lord, descending from above,

   Invites his children near,

   Display their glories here.


   Here in thy gospel's wondrous flame

   Fresh wisdom we pursue;

   A thousand angels learn thy name,

   Beyond whate'er they knew.


   Thy name is writ in fairest lines,

   Thy wonders here we trace;

   Wisdom through all the myst'ry shines,

   And shines in Jesus' face.


   The law its best obedience owes

   To our incarnate God;

   And thy revenging justice shows

   Its honors in his blood.


   But still the lustre of thy grace

   Our warmer thoughts employs,

   Gilds the whole scene with brighter rays,

   And more exalts our joys.

   Circumcision and baptism.

   [Written only for those who practise the baptism of infants.]


   Thus did the sons of Abram pass

   Under the bloody seal of grace;

   The young disciples bore the yoke,

   Till Christ the painful bondage broke.


   By milder ways doth Jesus prove

   His Father's cov'nant, and his love

   He seals to saints his glorious grace,

   And not forbids their infant race.


   Their seed is sprinkled with his blood,

   Their children set apart for God

   His Spirit on their offspring shed,

   Like water poured upon the head.


   Let every saint with cheerful voice

   In this large covenant rejoice;

   Young children in their early days

   Shall give the God of Abram praise.

   Corrupt nature from Adam.


   Blest with the joys of innocence

   Adam our father stood,

   Till he debased his soul to sense,

   And ate th' unlawful food.


   Now we are born a sensual race,

   To sinful joys inclined;

   Reason has lost its native place,

   And flesh enslaves the mind.


   While flesh, and sense, and passion reigns,

   Sin is the sweetest good;

   We fancy music in our chains,

   And so forget the load.


   Great God! renew our ruined frame,

   Our broken powers restore,

   Inspire us with a heav'nly flame,

   And flesh shall reign no more.


   Eternal Spirit! write thy law

   Upon our inward parts,

   And let the second Adam draw

   His image on our hearts.

   We walk by faith, not by sight.


   'Tis by the faith of joys to come

   We walk through deserts dark as night;

   Till we arrive at heav'n our home,

   Faith is our guide, and faith our light.


   The want of sight she well supplies,

   She makes the pearly gates appear;

   Far into distant worlds she pries,

   And brings eternal glories near.


   Cheerful we tread the desert through,

   While faith inspires a heav'nly ray;

   Though lions roar, and tempests blow,

   And rocks and dangers fill the way.


   So Abram, by divine command,

   Left his own house to walk with God;

   His faith beheld the promised land,

   And fired his zeal along the road.

   Creating all things new.


   "Nature and sin are passed away,

   And the old Adam dies;

   My hands a new foundation lay,

   See the new world arise.


   "I'll be a Sun of Righteousness

   To the new heav'ns I make;

   None but the new-born heirs of grace

   My glories shall partake."


   Mighty Redeemer! set me free

   From my old state of sin;

   O make my soul alive to thee,

   Create new powers within.


   Renew mine eyes, and form mine ears,

   And mold my heart afresh;

   Give me new passions, joys, and fears,

   And turn the stone to flesh.


   Far from the regions of the dead,

   From sin, and earth, and hell,

   In the new world that grace has made,

   I would for ever dwell.

   And writ the blessings in thy word.


   [What if we trace the globe around,

   And search from Britain to Japan,

   There shall be no religion found

   So just to God, so safe for man.]


   In vain the trembling conscience seeks

   Some solid ground to rest upon;

   With long despair the spirit breaks,

   Till we aply to Christ alone.


   How well thy blessed truths agree!

   How wise and holy thy commands!

   Thy promises, how firm they be!

   How firm our hope and comfort stands.


   [Not the feigned fields of heath'nish bliss

   Could raise such pleasures in the mind;

   Nor does the Turkish paradise

   Pretend to joys so well refined.]


   Should all the forms that men devise

   I'd call them vanity and lies,

   And bind the gospel to my heart.

   Circumcision abolished.


   The promise was divinely free,

   Extensive was the grace;

   "I will the God of Abram be,

   And of his num'rous race.


   He said; and with a bloody seal

   Confirmed the words he spoke;

   Long did the sons of Abram feel

   The sharp and painful yoke.


   Till God's own Son, descending low,

   Gave his own flesh to bleed;

   And Gentiles taste the blessing now,

   From the hard bondage freed.

   Obtained their chief design, and ceased;

   The incense and the bleeding lamb,

   The ark, the altar, and the priest.

   About the young Redeemer's head

   What wonders and what glories meet!

   An unknown star arose, and led

   The eastern sages to his feet.


   Simeon and Anna both conspire

   The infant Savior to proclaim;

   Leap like the hart, and bless his name.


   Thus doth th' eternal Spirit own

   What his almighty grace can do.


   This remedy did wisdom find

   To heal diseases of the mind;

   This sovereign balm, whose virtues can

   Restore the ruined creature, man.


   The gospel bids the dead revive,

   Sinners obey the voice, and live;

   Dry bones are raised and clothed afresh,

   And hearts of stone are turned to flesh.


   [Where Satan reigned in shades of night

   The gospel strikes a heav'nly light;

   Our lusts its wondrous power controls,

   And calms the rage of angry souls.]


   [Lions and beasts of savage name

   Put on the nature of the lamb,

   While the wild world esteem it strange,

   Gaze, and admire, and hate the change.]

   A sure defence from all their rage.

   Such def'rence to thy Father's will,

   Cold mountains and the midnight air

   Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;

   How bright their glories be.


   Once they were mourning here below,

   And wet their couch with tears;

   They wrestled hard, as we do now,

   With sins, and doubts, and fears.


   I ask them whence their victory came,

   They, with united breath,

   Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,

   Their triumph to his death.

   And, following their incarnate God,

   Possess the promised rest.

   And helps my faith to rise.


   My eyes and cars shall bless his name,

   They read and hear his word;

   My touch and taste shall do the same

   When they receive the Lord.


   Baptismal water is designed

   To seal his cleansing grace,

   While at his feast of bread and wine

   He gives his saints a place.


   But not the waters of a flood

   Can make my flesh so clean,

   As by his Spirit and his blood

   He'll wash my soul from sin.


   Not choicest meats, or noblest wines,

   So much my heart refresh,

   As when my faith goes through the signs,

   And feeds upon his flesh.


   I love the Lord that stoops so low

   To give his word a seal;

   But the rich grace his hands bestow

   Exceeds the figures still.

   While, like a penitent, I stand,

   And there confess my sin.


   My soul looks back to see

   The burdens thou didst bear

   When hanging on the cursed tree,

   And hopes her guilt was there.

   Now I complain, and groan, and die,

   While sin and Satan reign;

   Now raise my songs of triumph high,

   For grace prevails again.


   So darkness struggles with the light

   Till perfect day arise;

   And sat like tongues of cloven flame.


   What gifts, what miracles he gave!

   And power to kill, and power to save!

   Furnished their tongues with wondrous words,

   Instead of shields, and spears, and swords.


   Thus armed, he sent the champions forth

   From east to west, from south to north

   Go, spread the myst'ry of his cross.

   Of what almighty force they are

   Nations, the learned and the rude,

   The creation of the world. Gen. 1


   "Now let a spacious world arise,"

   Said the Creator Lord:

   At once th' obedient earth and skies

   Rose at his sovereign word.


   [Dark was the deep; the waters lay

   Confused, and drowned the land:

   He called the light; the new-born day

   Attends on his command.


   He bids the clouds ascend on high;

   The clouds ascend, and bear

   A wat'ry treasure to the sky,

   And float on softer air.


   The liquid element below

   Was gathered by his hand;

   The rolling seas together flow,

   And leave the solid land.


   With herbs and plants, a flowery birth,

   The naked globe he crowned,

   Ere there was rain to bless the earth,

   Or sun to warm the ground.


   Then he adorned the upper skies;

   Behold the sun appears;

   The moon and stars in order rise

   To make our months and years.


   Out of the deep th' almighty King.

   Did vital beings frame,

   The painted fowls of every wing,

   And fish of every name.]


   He gave the lion and the worm

   At once their wondrous birth;

   And grazing beasts of various form

   Rose from the teeming earth.


   Adam was framed of equal clay,

   Though sovereign of the rest

   Designed for nobler ends than they,

   With God's own image blest.


   Thus glorious in the Maker's eye

   The young creation stood;

   He saw the building from on high,

   His word pronounced it good.


   Lord, while the frame of nature stands,

   Thy praise shall fill my tongue;

   But the new world of grace demands

   A more exalted song.

   And while the heedless wretch believes,

   She makes his fetters strong.


   She pleads for all the joys she brings,

   And gives a fair pretence;

   But cheats the soul of heav'nly things,

   And chains it down to sense.

   Their vilest sins forgiv'n.


   The saints on earth and all the dead

   But one communion make;

   All join in Christ their living Head,

   And of his grace partake.


   In such society as this

   My weary soul would rest;

   The man that dwells where Jesus is

   Must be for ever blest.

  HYMN 153

   C. M.

   The distemper, folly, and madness of sin


   Sin, like a venomous disease,

   Infects our vital blood;

   The only balm is sovereign grace,

   And the physician, God.


   Our beauty and our strength are fled,

   And we draw near to death;

   But Christ the Lord recalls the dead

   With his almighty breath.


   Madness by nature reigns within,

   The passions burn and rage,

   Till God's own Son, with skill divine,

   The inward fire assuage.


   [We lick the dust, we grasp the wind,

   And solid good despise;

   Such is the folly of the mind,

   Till Jesus makes us wise.


   We give our souls the wounds they feel,

   We drink the pois'nous gall,

   And rush with fury down to hell;

   But Heav'n prevents the fall.]


   [The man possessed among the tombs

   Cuts his own flesh, and cries;

   He foams and raves, till Jesus comes,

   And the foul spirit flies.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 154

   L. M.

   Self-righteousness insufficient.


   "Where are the mourners," saith the Lord,

   "That wait and tremble at my word,

   That walk in darkness all the day?

   Come, make my name your trust and stay.


   ["No works nor duties of your own

   Can for the smallest sin atone

   The robes that nature may provide

   Will not your least pollutions hide.


   "The softest couch that nature knows

   Can give the conscience no repose;

   Look to my righteousness and live;

   Comfort and peace are mine to give.]


   "Ye sons of pride, that kindle coals

   With your own hands, to warm your souls

   Walk in the light of your own fire,

   Enjoy the sparks that ye desire:


   "This is your portion at my hands;--

   Hell waits you with her iron bands;

   Ye shall lie down in sorrow there,

   In death, in darkness, and despair."

  HYMN 155

   C. M.

   Christ our passover.


   Lo, the destroying angel flies

   To Pharaoh's stubborn land;

   The pride and flower of Egypt dies

   By his vindictive hand.


   He passed the tents of Jacob o'er,

   Nor poured the wrath divine;

   He saw the blood on every door,

   And blessed the peaceful sign.


   Thus the appointed Lamb must bleed,

   To break the Egyptian yoke;

   Thus Isr'el is from bondage freed,

   And 'scapes the angel's stroke.


   Lord, if my heart were sprinkled too

   With blood so rich as thine,

   Justice no longer would pursue

   This guilty soul of mine.


   Jesus our passover was slain,

   And has at once procured

   Freedom from Satan's heavy chain,

   And God's avenging sword.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 156

   C. M.

   Presumption and despair; or, Satan's various temptations.


   I hate the tempter and his charms,

   I hate his flatt'ring breath;

   The serpent takes a thousand forms

   To cheat our souls to death.


   He feeds our hopes with airy dreams,

   Or kills with slavish fear;

   And holds us still in wide extremes,

   Presumption or despair.


   Now he persuades, "How easy 'tis

   To walk the road to heav'n;"

   Anon he swells our sins, and cries,

   "They cannot be forgiv'n."


   [He bids young sinners "yet forbear

   To think of God, or death;

   For prayer and devotion are

   But melancholy breath."


   He tells the aged, "they must die,

   "And 'tis too late to pray;

   In vain for mercy now they cry,

   For they have lost their day."]


   Thus he supports his cruel throne

   By mischief and deceit,

   And drags the sons of Adam down

   To darkness and the pit.


   Almighty God, cut short his power,

   Let him in darkness dwell

   And that he vex the earth no more,

   Confine him down to hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 157

   C. M.

   Satan's devices.


   Now Satan comes with dreadful roar

   And threatens to destroy;

   He worries whom he can't devour

   With a malicious joy.


   Ye sons of God, oppose his rage,

   Resist, and he'll begone;

   Thus did our dearest Lord engage

   And vanquish him alone.


   Now he appears almost divine,

   Like innocence and love;

   But the old serpent lurks within

   When he assumes the dove.


   Fly from the false deceiver's tongue,

   Ye sons of Adam, fly;

   Our parents found the snare too strong,

   Nor should the children try.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 158

   L. M.

   Few saved; or, The almost Christian, the hypocrite, and apostate.


   Broad is the road that leads to death,

   And thousands walk together there;

   But wisdom shows a narrower path,

   With here and there a traveller.


   "Deny thyself, and take thy cross,"

   Is the Redeemer's great command;

   Nature must count her gold but dross,

   If she would gain this heav'nly land.


   The fearful soul that tires and faints,

   And walks the ways of God no more,

   Is but esteemed almost a saint,

   And makes his own destruction sure.


   Lord, let not all my hopes be vain

   Create my heart entirely new;

   Which hypocrites could ne'er attain,

   Which false apostates never knew.

   An unconverted state; or, Converting grace.


   [Great King of glory and of grace,

   We own, with humble shame,

   How vile is our degen'rate race,

   And our first father's name.]


   From Adam flows our tainted blood,

   The poison reigns within;

   Makes us averse to all that's good,

   And willing slaves to sin.


   [Daily we break thy holy laws,

   And then reject thy grace;

   Engaged in the old serpent's cause,

   Against our Maker's face.l


   We live estranged afar from God,

   And love the distance well;

   With haste we run the dangerous road

   That leads to death and hell.


   And can such rebels be restored?

   Such natures made divine?

   Let sinners see thy glory, Lord,

   And feel this power of thine.


   We raise our Fathers name on high

   Who his own Spirit sends

   To bring rebellious strangers nigh,

   And turn his foes to friends.

   L. M.

   Custom in sin.


   Let the wild leopards of the wood

   Put off the spots that nature gives,

   Then may the wicked turn to God,

   And change their tempers and their lives.


   As well might Ethiopian slaves

   Wash out the darkness of their skin,

   The deed as well might leave their graves,

   As old transgressors cease to sin.


   Where vice has held its empire long,

   'Twill not endure the least control;

   None but a power divinely strong

   Can turn the current of the soul.


   Great God! I own thy power divine

   That works to change this heart of mine;

   I would be formed anew, and bless

   The wonders of creating grace.

  HYMN 161

   C. M.

   Christian virtues; or, The difficulty of conversion.


   Strait is the way, the door is strait,

   That leads to joys on high;

   'Tis but a few that find the gate,

   While crowds mistake, and die.


   Beloved self must be denied,

   The mind and will renewed

   Passion suppressed, and patience tried,

   And vain desires subdued.


   [Flesh is a dangerous foe to grace,

   Where it prevails and rules;

   Flesh must be humbled, pride abased,

   Lest they destroy our souls.


   The love of gold be banished hence,

   That vile idolatry,

   And every member, every sense,

   in sweet subjection lie.]


   The tongue, that most unruly power,

   Requires a strong restraint;

   We must be watchful every hour,

   And pray, but never faint.


   Lord, can a feeble, helpless worm

   Fulfil a task so hard?

   Thy grace must all my work perform,

   And give the free reward.

   Meditation of heaven; or, The joy of faith.


   My thoughts surmount these lower skies,

   And look within the veil;

   There springs of endless pleasure rise,

   The waters never fail.


   There I behold, with sweet delight,

   The blessed Three in One;

   And strong affections fix my sight

   On God's incarnate Son.


   His promise stands for ever firm,

   His grace shall ne'er depart;

   He binds my name upon his arm,

   And seals it on his heart.


   Light are the pains that nature brings;

   How short our sorrows are,

   When with eternal future things

   The present we compare!


   I would not be a stranger still

   To that celestial place,

   Where I for ever hope to dwell

   Near my Redeemer's face.

   Complaint of desertion and temptations.


   Dear Lord! behold our sore distress;

   [The lion with his dreadful roar

   Affrights thy feeble sheep:

   Reveal the glory of thy power,

   And chain him to the deep.


   Must we indulge a long despair?

   Shall our petitions die?

   Our mournings never reach thine ear,

   Nor tears affect thine eye?]


   If thou despise a mortal groan,

   Yet hear a Savior's blood;

   An Advocate so near the throne

   Pleads and prevails with God.


   He brought the Spirit's powerful sword

   To slay our deadly foes;

   Our sins shall die beneath thy word,

   And hell in vain oppose.


   How boundless is our Father's grace,

   The end of the world.


   Why should this earth delight us so?

   While time his sharpest teeth prepares

   Our comforts to devour,

   There is a land above the stars,

   And joys above his power.


   Nature shall be dissolved and die,

   The sun must end his race,

   The earth and sea for ever fly

   Unfruitfulness, ignorance, and unsanctified affections.


   Long have I sat beneath the sound

   And knowledge of thy word!


   Oft I frequent thy holy place,

   And hear almost in vain;

   How small a portion of thy grace

   My memory can retain!


   [My dear Almighty, and my God,

   How little art thou known

   By all the judgments of thy rod,

   And blessings of thy throne!]


   How cold and feeble is my love!

   How negligent my fear!

   How low my hope of joys above!

   How few affections there!


   Great God! thy sovereign power impart

   To give thy word success;

   Write thy salvation in my heart,

   Those watchful eyes that never sleep

   [Speak we of strength? his arm is strong

   Infinite years his life prolong,

   [Sinners before his presence die;

   How holy is his name!

   His anger and his jealousy

   Justice upon a dreadful throne

   Maintains the rights of God;

   God incomprehensible and sovereign.


   [Can creatures to perfection find

   Th' eternal, uncreated Mind?

   Or can the largest stretch of thought

   Measure and search his nature out?


   'Tis high as heav'n, 'tis deep as hell

   And what can mortals know or tell?

   His glory spreads beyond the sky,

   And all the shining worlds on high.


   But man, vain man, would fain be wise;

   Born like a wild young colt, he flies

   Through all the follies of his mind,

   And swells, and snuffs the empty wind.]


   God is a King of power unknown,

   Firm are the orders of his throne;

   If he resolve, who dares oppose,

   Or ask him why or what he does?


   He wounds the heart, and he makes whole

   He calms the tempest of the soul;

   When he shuts up in long despair,

   Who can remove the heavy bar?


   He frowns, and darkness veils the moon;

   The fainting sun grows dim at noon;

   The pillars of heav'n's starry roof

   Tremble and start at his reproof.


   He gave the vaulted heav'n its form,

   The crooked serpent, and the worm;

   He breaks the billows with his breath,

   And smites the sons of pride to death.


   These are a portion of his ways;

   But who shall dare describe his face?

   Who can endure his light, or stand

   To hear the thunders of his hand?

  HYMN 1

   L. M.

   The Lord's supper instituted. 1 Cor. 11:23ff


   'Twas on that dark, that doleful night

   When powers of earth and hell arose

   Against the Son of God's delight,

   And friends betrayed him to his foes:


   Before the mournful scene began,

   He took the bread, and blessed, and brake:

   What love through all his actions ran!

   What wondrous words of grace he spake!


   "This is my body, broke for sin;

   Receive and eat the living food:"

   Then took the cup, and blessed the wine;

   "'Tis the new cov'nant in my blood."


   [For us his flesh with nails was torn,

   He bore the scourge, he felt the thorn;

   And justice poured upon his head

   Its heavy vengeance in our stead.


   For us his vital blood was spilt,

   To buy the pardon of our guilt,

   When, for black crimes of biggest size,

   He gave his soul a sacrifice.]


   "Do this," he cried, "till time shall end,

   In memory of your dying Friend;

   Meet at my table, and record

   The love of your departed Lord."


   [Jesus, thy feast we celebrate,

   We show thy death, we sing thy name,

   Till thou return, and we shall eat

   The marriage supper of the Lamb.]

   Communion with Christ, and with saints. 1 Cor. 10:16,17


   [Jesus invites his saints

   To meet around his board;

   Here pardoned rebels sit and hold

   Communion with their Lord.


   For food he gives his flesh,

   He bids us drink his blood;

   Amazing favor! matchless grace

   Of our descending God!]


   This holy bread and wine

   Maintains our fainting breath,

   By union with our living Lord,

   And int'rest in his death.


   Our heav'nly Father calls

   Christ and his members one;

   We the young children of his love,

   And he the first-born Son.


   We are but several parts

   Of the same broken bread;

   One body hath its several limbs,

   But Jesus is the head.


   Let all our powers be joined

   His glorious name to raise;

   Pleasure and love fill every mind,

   And every voice be praise.

  HYMN 3

   C. M.

   The new testament in the blood of Christ; or, The new covenant sealed


   "The promise of my Father's love

   Shall stand for ever good,"

   He said; and gave his soul to death,

   And sealed the grace with blood.


   To this dear cov'nant of thy word

   I set my worthless name;

   I seal th' engagement to my Lord,

   And make my humble claim.


   Thy light, and strength, and pard'ning grace,

   And glory, shall be mine

   My life and soul, my heart and flesh,

   And all my powers, are thine.


   I call that legacy my own

   Which Jesus did bequeath;

   'Twas purchased with a dying groan,

   And ratified in death.


   Sweet is the memory of his name

   Who blessed us in his will,

   And to his testament of love

   Made his own life the seal.

  HYMN 4

   C. M.

   Christ's dying love; or, Our pardon bought at a dear price.


   How condescending and how kind

   Was God's eternal Son!

   Our misery reached his heav'nly mind,

   And pity brought him down.


   [When Justice, by our sins provoked,

   Drew forth its dreadful sword,

   He gave his soul up to the stroke

   Without a murm'ring word.]


   [He sunk beneath our heavy woes,

   To raise us to his throne;

   There's ne'er a gift his hand bestows

   But cost his heart a groan.]


   This was compassion like a God,

   That when the Savior knew

   The price of pardon was his blood,

   His pity ne'er withdrew.


   Now, though he reigns exalted high,

   His love is still as great;

   Well he remembers Calvary,

   Nor let his saints forget.


   [Here we behold his bowels roll,

   As kind as when he died;

   And see the sorrows of his soul

   Bleed through his wounded side.]


   [Here we receive repeated seals

   Of Jesus' dying love:

   Hard is the wretch that never feels

   One soft affection move.]


   Here let our hearts begin to melt

   While we his death record,

   And with our joy for pardoned guilt,

   Mourn that we pierced the Lord.

   Christ the bread of life. John 6:31,35,39.


   Let us adore th' eternal Word,

   'Tis he our souls hath fed:

   Thou art our living stream, O Lord,

   And thou th' immortal bread.


   [The manna came from lower skies,

   But Jesus from above,

   Where the fresh springs of pleasure rise,

   And rivers flow with love.


   The Jews, the fathers, died at last,

   Who ate that heav'nly bread;

   But these provisions which we taste

   Can raise us from the dead.]


   Blest be the Lord that gives his flesh

   To nourish dying men;

   And often spreads his table fresh,

   Lest we should faint again.


   Our souls shall draw their heav'nly breath

   While Jesus finds supplies;

   Nor shall our graces sink to death,

   For Jesus never dies.


   [Daily our mortal flesh decays,

   But Christ our life shall come;

   His unresisted power shall raise

   Our bodies from the tomb.]

   L. M.

   The memorial of our absent lord. John 16:16; Luke 22:19; John 14:3


   Jesus is gone above the skies,

   Where our weak senses reach him not;

   And carnal objects court our eyes,

   To thrust our Savior from our thought.


   He knows what wand'ring hearts we have,

   Apt to forget his lovely face;

   And, to refresh our minds, he gave

   These kind memorials of his grace.


   The Lord of life this table spread

   With his own flesh and dying blood;

   We on the rich provision feed,

   And taste the wine, and bless the God.


   Let sinful sweets be all forgot,

   And earth grow less in our esteem

   Christ and his love fill every thought,

   And faith and hope be fixed on him.


   While he is absent from our sight,

   'Tis to prepare our souls a place,

   That we may dwell in heav'nly light,

   And live for ever near his face.


   [Our eyes look upwards to the hills

   Whence our returning Lord shall come;

   We wait thy chariot's awful wheels,

   To fetch our longing spirits home.]

   L. M.

   Crucifixion to the world by the cross of Christ. Gal. 6:14


   When I survey the wondrous cross

   On which the Prince of glory died,

   My richest gain I count but loss,

   And pour contempt on all my pride.


   Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,

   Save in the death of Christ my God!

   All the vain things that charm me most,

   I sacrifice them to his blood.


   See from his head, his hands, his feet,

   Sorrow and love flow mingled down!

   Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,

   Or thorns compose so rich a crown!


   [His dying crimson, like a robe,

   Spreads o'er his body on the tree:

   Then am I dead to all the globe,

   And all the globe is dead to me.]


   Were the whole realm of nature mine,

   That were a present far too small;

   Love so amazing, so divine,

   Demands my soul, my life, my all.

   Weary and faint ye stood,

   The tree of life, that near the throne

   In heav'n's high garden grows,

   Laden with grace, bends gently down

   Its ever-smiling boughs.


   [Hov'ring amongst the leaves there stands

   The sweet celestial Dove;

   And Jesus on the branches hangs

   The banner of his love.]


   ['Tis a young heav'n of strange delight

   While in his shade we sit;

   His fruit is pleasing to the sight,

   And to the taste as sweet.


   New life it spreads through dying hearts,

   And cheers the drooping mind;

   Vigor and joy the juice imparts,

   Without a sting behind.]


   Now let the flaming weapon stand,

   And guard all Eden's trees

   There's ne'er a plant in all that land

   That bears such fruits as these.


   Infinite grace our souls adore,

   Whose wondrous hand has made

   This living branch of sovereign power

   To raise and heal the dead.

   S. M.

   The Spirit, the water, and the blood. 1 John 5:6.


   [Let all our tongues be one

   To praise our God on high,

   Who from his bosom sent his Son

   To fetch us strangers nigh.


   Nor let our voices cease

   To sing the Savior's name;

   Jesus, th' ambassador of peace,

   How cheerfully he came!


   It cost him cries and tears

   To bring us near to God;

   Great was our debt, and he appears

   To make the payment good.]


   [My Savior's pierced side

   Poured out a double flood;

   By water we are purified,

   And pardoned by the blood.


   Infinite was our guilt,

   But he, our Priest, atones;

   On the cold ground his life was spilt,

   And offered with his groans.]


   Look up, my soul, to him

   Whose death was thy desert,

   And humbly view the living stream

   Flow from his breaking heart.


   There, on the cursed tree,

   In dying pangs he lies,

   Fulfils his Father's great decree,

   And all our wants supplies.


   Thus the Redeemer came

   By water and by blood;

   And when the Spirit speaks the same,

   We feel his witness good.


   While the eternal Three

   Bear their record above,

   Here I believe he died for me,

   And seal my Savior's love.


   [Lord, cleanse my soul from sin

   Nor let thy grace depart;

   Great Comforter, abide within,

   And witness to my heart.]

  HYMN 10

   L. M.

   Christ crucified, the wisdom and power of God.


   Nature with open volume stands,

   To spread her Maker's praise abroad;

   And every labor of his hands

   Shows something worthy of a God.


   But in the grace that rescued man

   His brightest form of glory shines;

   Here, on the cross, 'tis fairest drawn,

   In precious blood and crimson lines.


   [Here his whole name appears complete;

   Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove,

   Which of the letters best is writ,

   The power, the wisdom, or the love.]


   Here I behold his inmost heart,

   Where grace and vengeance strangely join,

   Piercing his Son with sharpest smart,

   To make the purchased pleasure mine.


   O! the sweet wonders of that cross,

   Where God the Savior loved and died

   Her noblest life my spirit draws

   From his dear wounds and bleeding side.


   I would for ever speak his name,

   In sounds to mortal ears unknown;

   With angels join to praise the Lamb,

   And worship at his Father's throne.

  HYMN 11

   C. M.

   Pardon brought to our senses.


   Lord, how divine thy comforts are!

   How heav'nly is the place

   Where Jesus spreads the sacred feast

   Of his redeeming grace!


   There the rich bounties of our God,

   And sweetest glories shine;

   There Jesus says that "I am his,

   And my Beloved's mine."


   "Here," says the kind, redeeming Lord,

   And shows his wounded side;

   "See here the spring of all your joys

   That opened when I died."


   [He smiles, and cheers my mournful heart,

   And tells of all his pain;

   'All this," says he, "I bore for thee;"

   And then he smiles again.]


   What shall we pay our heav'nly King

   For grace so vast as this?

   He brings our pardon to our eyes,

   And seals it with a kiss.


   [Let such amazing loves as these

   Be sounded all abroad;

   Such favors are beyond degrees,

   And worthy of a God.]


   To him that washed us in his blood

   Be everlasting praise;

   Salvation, honor, glory, power,

   Eternal as his days.]

   The gospel feast. Luke 14:16ff.


   [How rich are thy provisions, Lord!

   Thy table furnished from above!

   The fruits of life o'erspread the board,

   The cup o'erflows with heav'nly love.


   Thine ancient family, the Jews,

   Were first invited to the feast:

   We humbly take what they refuse,

   And Gentiles thy salvation taste.


   We are the poor, the blind, the lame,

   And help was far, and death was nigh;

   But at the gospel-call we caine,

   And every want received supply.


   From the highway that leads to hell,

   From paths of darkness and despair,

   Lord, we are come with thee to dwell,

   Glad to enjoy thy presence here.]


   [What shall we pay th' eternal Son,

   That left the heav'n of his abode,

   And to this wretched earth came down,

   To bring us wand'rers back to God?


   It cost him death to save our lives;

   To buy our souls it cost his own;

   And all the unknown joys he gives

   Were bought with agonies unknown.


   Our everlasting love is due

   To him that ransomed sinners lost

   And pitied rebels, when he knew

   The vast expense his love would cost.]

   Divine love making a feast and calling in the guests. Luke 14:17,22,23


   How sweet and aweful is the place

   With Christ within the doors,

   While everlasting love displays

   The choicest of her stores!


   Here every bowel of our God

   With soft compassion rolls;

   Here peace and pardon bought with blood

   Is food for dying souls.


   [While all our hearts and all our songs

   Join to admire the feast,

   Each of us cry with thankful tongues,

   "Lord, why was I a guest?


   "Why was I made to hear thy voice,

   And enter while there's room;

   When thousands make a wretched choice,

   And rather starve than come?"]


   'Twas the same love that spread the feast

   That sweetly forced us in

   Else we had still refused to taste,

   And perished in our sin.


   [Pity the nations, O our God!

   Constrain the earth to come;

   Send thy victorious word abroad,

   And bring the strangers home.


   We long to see thy churches full,

   That all the chosen race

   May with one voice, and heart, and soul,

   Sing thy redeeming grace.]

   The song of Simeon; or, A sight of Christ makes death easy. Luke 2:28


   Now have our hearts embraced our God,

   We would forget all earthly charms,

   And wish to die, as Simeon would,

   With his young Savior in his arms.


   Our lips should learn that joyful song,

   Were but our hearts prepared like his

   Our souls still willing to be gone,

   And at thy word depart in peace.


   Here we have seen thy face, O Lord,

   And viewed salvation with our eyes,

   Tasted and felt the living word,

   The bread descending from the skies.


   Thou hast prepared this dying Lamb,

   Hast set his blood before our face,

   To teach the terrors of thy name,

   And show the wonders of thy grace.


   He is our light; our morning star

   Shall shine on nations yet unknown;

   The glory of thine Isr'el here,

   And joy of spirits near thy throne.

   Our Lord Jesus at his own table


   [The memory of our dying Lord

   Awakes a thankful tongue:

   How rich he spread his royal board,

   And blessed the food, and sung!


   Happy the men that eat this bread;

   But doubly blest was he

   That gently bowed his loving head,

   And leaned it, Lord, on thee.


   By faith the same delights we taste

   As that great favorite did;

   And sit and lean on Jesus' breast,

   And take the heav'nly bread.]


   Down from the palace of the skies,

   Hither the King descends:

   "Come, my beloved, eat," he cries;

   "And drink salvation, friends.


   ["My flesh is food and physic too,

   A balm for all your pains;

   And the red streams of pardon flow

   From these my pierced veins."]


   Hosannah to his bounteous love

   For such a taste below!

   And yet he feeds his saints above

   With nobler blessings too.


   [Come the dear day, the glorious hour,

   That brings our souls to rest!

   Then we shall need these types no more,

   But dwell at th' heav'nly feast.]

   C. M.

   The agonies of Christ.


   Now let our pains be all forgot,

   Our hearts no more repine;

   Our suff'rings are not worth a thought,

   When, Lord, compared with thine.


   In lively figures here we see

   The bleeding Prince of love;

   Each of us hope, he died for me,

   And then our griefs remove.


   [Our humble faith here takes her rise,

   While sitting round his board;

   And back to Calvary she flies,

   To view her groaning Lord.


   His soul, what agonies it felt

   When his own God withdrew;

   And the large load of all our guilt

   Lay heavy on him too!


   But the Divinity within

   Supported him to bear;

   Dying, he conquered hell and sin,

   And made his triumph there.]


   Grace, wisdom, justice joined and wrought

   The wonders of that day;

   No mortal tongue, nor mortal thought,

   Can equal thanks repay.


   Our hymns should sound like those above,

   Could we our voices raise;

   Yet, Lord, our hearts shall all be love,

   And all our lives be praise.

   S. M.

   Incomparable food; or, The flesh and blood of Christ.


   [We sing th' amazing deeds

   That grace divine performs;

   Th eternal God comes down and bleeds

   To nourish dying worms.


   This soul-reviving wine,

   Dear Savior, is thy blood;

   We thank that sacred flesh of thine

   For this immortal food.]


   The banquet that we eat

   Is made of heav'nly things;

   Earth has no dainties half so sweet

   As our Redeemer brings.


   In vain had Adam sought

   And searched his garden round;

   For there was no such blessed fruit

   In all that happy ground.


   Th' angelic host above

   Can never taste this food;

   They feast upon their Maker's love,

   But not a Savior's blood.


   On us th' almighty Lord

   Bestows this matchless grace,

   And meets us with some cheering word,

   With pleasure in his face.


   Come, all ye drooping saints,

   And banquet with the King;

   This wine will drown your sad complaints,

   And tune your voice to sing-


   Salvation to the name

   Of our adored Christ!

   Through the wide earth his grace proclaim,

   His glory in the high'st.

   Thy sacred flesh our souls have eat,

   'Tis living bread; we thank thee, Lord!


   And here we drink our Savior's blood;

   We thank thee, Lord, 'tis gen'rous wine

   Mingled with love; the fountain flowed

   From that dear bleeding heart of thine.


   On earth is no such sweetness found,

   For the Lamb's flesh is heav'nly food;

   In vain we search the globe around

   For bread so fine, or wine so good.


   Carnal provisions can at best

   But cheer the heart, or warm the head;

   But the rich cordial that we taste

   Gives life eternal to the dead.


   Joy to the Master of the feast;

   His name our souls for ever bless;

   To God the King, and God the Priest,

   A loud hosannah round the place.

   And thine own flesh feeds every guest.


   Our faith adores thy bleeding love,

   And trusts for life in one that died

   We hope for heav'nly crowns above,

   From a Redeemer crucified.


   Let the vain world pronounce it shame,

   And fling their scandals on the cause;

   We come to boast our Savior's name,

   And make our triumphs in his cross.


   With joy we tell the scoffing age,

   He that was dead has left his tomb;

   He lives above their utmost rage,

   And we are waiting till he come.

   With rich immortal fruit;

   And ne'er an angry flaming sword

   To guard the passage to 't.


   The cup stands crowned with living juice,

   The fountain flows above,

   And runs down streaming for our use,

   In rivulets of love.]


   The food's prepared by heav'nly art,

   The pleasures well refined

   They spread new life through every heart,

   And cheer the drooping mind.


   Shout and proclaim the Savior's love,

   The triumphal feast for Christ's victory over sin, and death, and hell.


   [Come, let us lift our voices high,

   High as our joys arise,

   And join the songs above the sky,

   Where pleasure never dies.


   Jesus, the God that fought and bled,

   And conquered when he fell;

   That rose, and at his chariot-wheels

   Dragged all the powers of hell.]


   [Jesus, the God, invites us here

   To this triumphal feast,

   And brings immortal blessings down

   For each redeemed guest.]


   The Lord! how glorious is his face!

   How kind his smiles appear!

   And O! what melting words he says

   To every humble ear!


   "For you, the children of my love,

   It was for you I died;

   Behold my hands, behold my feet,

   And look into my side.


   "These are the wounds for you I bore,

   The tokens of my pains,

   When I came down to free your souls

   From misery and chains.


   ["Justice unsheathed its fiery sword,

   And plunged it in my heart;

   Infinite pangs for you I bore,

   And most tormenting smart.


   "When hell, and all its spiteful powers,

   Stood dreadful in my way,

   To rescue those dear lives of yours,

   I gave my own away.


   "But while I bled, and groaned, and died,

   I ruined Satan's throne;

   High on my cross I hung, and spied

   The monster tumbling down.


   "Now you must triumph at my feast,

   And taste my flesh, my blood;

   And live eternal ages blest,

   For 'tis immortal food."


   Victorious God! what can we pay

   For favors so divine?

   We would devote our hearts away

   To be for ever thine.]

   And melting as his dying love!


   Was ever equal pity found?

   The Prince of heav'n resigns his breath,

   And pours his life out on the ground,

   To ransom guilty worms from death.


   [Rebels, we broke our Maker's laws

   He from the threat'nings set us free,

   Bore the full vengeance on his cross,

   And nailed the curses to the tree.]


   [The law proclaims no terror now,

   And Sinai's thunder roars no more;

   From all his wounds new blessings flow,

   A sea of joy without a shore.


   Here we have washed our deepest stains,

   And healed our wounds with heav'nly blood;

   Blest fountain! springing from the veins

   Of Jesus, our incarnate God.]


   In vain our mortal voices strive

   We see the blood of Jesus shed,

   Whence all our pardons rise

   The sinner views th' atonement made,

   And loves the sacrifice.


   Thy cruel thorns, thy shameful cross,

   Procure us heav'nly crowns;

   Our highest gain springs from thy loss,

   Our healing from thy wounds.


   O! 'tis impossible that we,

   Who dwell in feeble clay,

   We shall appear before the throne

   Of our forgiving God,

   Dressed in the garments of his Son,

   And sprinkled with his blood.


   We shall be strong to run the race,

   And climb the upper sky;

   Christ will provide our souls with grace,

   Here thy revenging justice stands,

   And pleads its dreadful cause;

   Here saving mercy spreads her hands,

   Like Jesus on the cross.


   Thy saints attend with every grace

   On this great sacrifice;

   And love appears with cheerful face,

   And faith with fixed eyes.


   Our hope in waiting posture sits,

   To heav'n directs her sight;

   Here every warmer passion meets,

   And warmer powers unite.


   Zeal and revenge perform their part,

   And rising sin destroy;

   Repentance comes with aching heart,

   Yet not forbids the joy.


   Dear Savior, change our faith to sight;

   Let sin for ever die;

   Then shall our souls be all delight,

   And every tear be dry.

DOXOLOGIES.

   [I cannot persuade myself to put a full period to these Divine Hymns
   till I have addressed a special song of glory to God the Father, the
   Son, and the Holy Spirit. Though the Latin name of it, Gloria Patri, be
   retained in our nation from the Roman church, and though there be some
   excesses of superstitious honor paid to the words of it, which may have
   wrought some unhappy prejudices in weaker Christians, yet I believe it
   still to he one of the noblest parts of Christian worship. The subject
   of it is the doctrine of the Trinity, which is that peculiar glory of
   the Divine nature that our Lord Jesus Christ has so clearly revealed
   unto men, and is so necessary to true Christianity. The action is
   praise, which is one of the most complete and exalted parts of heavenly
   worship. I have cast the song into a variety of forms, and have fitted
   it, by a plain version, or a larger paraphrase, to he sung either alone
   or at the conclusion of another hymn. I have added also a few
   Hosannahs, or ascriptions of salvation to Christ, in the same manner,
   and for the same end.]

   L. M.

   A song of praise to the ever-blessed Trinity, God the Father, Son, and
   Spirit.


   Blest be the Father and his love,

   To whose celestial source we owe

   Rivers of endless joy above,

   And rills of comfort here below.


   Glory to thee, great Son of God,

   From whose dear wounded body rolls

   A precious stream of vital blood,

   Pardon and life for dying souls.


   We give the sacred Spirit praise,

   Who in our hearts of sin and woe

   Makes living springs of grace arise,

   And into boundless glory flow.


   Thus God the Father, God the Son,

   And God the Spirit, we adore;

   That sea of life and love unknown,

   8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4


   To him that chose us first,

   Before the world began;

   To him that bore the curse

   To save rebellious man;

   To him that formed

   Our hearts anew

   Is endless praise

   And glory due.


   The Father's love shall run

   Through our immortal songs;

   We bring to God the Son

   Hosannahs on our tongues:

   Our lips address

   The Spirit's name

   With equal praise,

   And zeal the same.


   Let every saint above,

   And angel round the throne,

   For ever bless and love

   The sacred Three in One;

   Thus heav'n shall raise

   His honors high,

   When earth and time

   Grow old and die.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYMN 40

   8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4

   To God the Spirit praise:

   And while our lips

   Their tribute bring,

   Our faith adores

   The name we sing.

   And at his feet

   Their honors lay.


   Glory to God on high,

   Let earth, and sea, and sky,

   His wondrous love proclaim:

   Upon his head

   Shall honors rest,

   And every age

   Pronounce him blest.

  HYMN 1

   C. M.


   Am I a Soldier of the Cross?

   A follower of the Lamb,

   And shall I fear to own His cause,

   Or blush to speak His name?


   Must I be carried to the skies

   On flowery beds of ease,

   While others fought to win the prize,

   And sailed through bloody seas?


   Are there no foes for me to fight?

   Must I not stem the flood?

   Is this dark world a friend to grace,

   To help me on to God?


   Sure, I must fight if I would reign

   Increase my courage, Lord.

   I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,

   Supported by Thy word.


   Thy saints, in all this glorious war

   Shall conquer, though they die;

   They see the triumph from afar

   By faith's discerning eye.


   When that illustrious day shall rise

   And all Thine armies shine

   In robes of victory through the skies,

   The glory shall be Thine.
